People need to get paid.<p>I&#x27;m only calling for coming up with better business models or go back to the straight up &quot;charge for it&quot; model that the free market system is built on. The bit about &quot;free up the internet for what it was meant for: free exchange of information&quot; is not my point, though we do need to come up with a business model that gets people paid but also let&#x27;s the information that is the lifeblood of democracy flow freely to all people regardless of ability to pay.

It&#x27;s the same reason that desktop Java was in vogue for a little while: you only have to write one UI, and you can run it from a HTTP connection with almost no local permissions. Of course, this was (and still is) a security nightmare, but browsers now do a pretty good job of sandboxing individual code blobs, and also do a pretty good job of abstracting away the native UI. Web apps also provide low or zero installation overhead (low friction to getting a user onboarded/working/monetized/whatever).<p>It would be nice to see some progressive enhancement folks address how to resolve these pain points on the native side, rather than just saying web shouldn&#x27;t be like native.",1438095501

In order to emulate native apps, of course.<p>If we&#x27;re doing unpopular opinion time, I think this is the real issue that no one wants to talk about. I&#x27;m all for whatever feature development the community can standardize. Apple, google, mozilla, and etc. all have smart people working for them and when they cooperate things seem to work out fine. The problem is trying to achieve the feel of native applications in a _non_ native application. Browsers should do one thing well, but that one thing has no real business being duplication of mathematica, quake, or visual studio.<p>It&#x27;s always interesting to see a Show HN where someone cleverly gets an approximation of one or another of those things running in the browser, but come on. Making the browser the operating system is simply going to push the same old incompatibility problems into the browser. It&#x27;s not going to solve them.",1438095493

9961924,comment,9960730,9961306,0,0,logfromblammo,,,"Just last weekend, I saw the episode of &quot;How It&#x27;s Made&quot; on Science Channel that covered vinyl pressed records.<p>Here&#x27;s a comparison of the processes.<p>Vinyl:<p><pre><code>  - Manufacture lacquered master discs (50% QC rejection rate!)
  - Ship lacquered discs to recording studio
  - Put master in recording machine
  - Cut test groove
  - Inspect with built-in microscope
  - Cut lead-in
  - Cut audio tracks, in 2-channel stereo
  - Cut lead-out, label master by hand
  - Ship back to factory
  - Use chemical process to create nickel-silver negative
  - Peel metal negative off lacquered disc
  - Manually find center with microscope
  - Center-punch and trim metal master
  - Use metal master to stamp out vinyl disc copies
  - Ship heavy discs to distributors
</code></pre>
Digital:<p><pre><code>  - Press &quot;record&quot;, press &quot;stop&quot;
  - Upload raw audio tracks to studio file server
  - Sequence and mix raw audio into master song track
  - Assemble album
  - Add metadata
  - Re-encode master tracks to consumer quality
  - Upload to distributor&#x27;s server
</code></pre>
The capital requirements for digital recording are very low now, having benefited from Moore&#x27;s Law.  If you can buy just one high-quality microphone and one decent laptop, and invest a whole lot of your own time, you can single-handedly produce an album with quality comparable to the best studio recordings of the vinyl era.<p>While Bobby McFerrin is the first person that I am aware of who did this, some artists will record separate tracks of themselves performing every part of a song, and painstakingly assemble the result in the studio to make their album.  Then they hire other people to play those parts at live performances, or just leave some parts out.<p>In the vinyl era, you needed session musicians on staff at the studio.  If someone screwed up, you couldn&#x27;t easily re-record just that track.  You usually had to re-do the whole thing.<p>So there are good reasons why music was relatively more expensive back then.  Those reasons no longer apply.",1438095301

I think what I&#x27;m trying to say, and I suspect that we agree, is that there&#x27;s the right tool for a job. Setting up a project to use 200mb of over-complicated npm modules and tools probably signifies the work of an inexperienced craftsman. Likewise, a non-trivial project built entirely from home-grown native Javascript may well run into complexity problems too as it re-implements features for which simple, well-tested and widely-used open source modules are available. Our desire for simplicity will lead us variously towards either of these extremes, and our experience tells us how to tread. We want our projects to be &quot;simple&quot;, but that doesn&#x27;t mean they&#x27;re going to be &quot;easy&quot;. The barrier to entry for frontend development is increasing in terms of developer capability, but that doesn&#x27;t mean complexity is increasing, or that well architected projects that use modern tooling aren&#x27;t simple.",1438095168

When a service assembles a list of such people, the value of that list to the advertiser generally exceeds the sum of the individual payments provided by the subscribers.<p>You can increase the subscription fee, but then you&#x27;ll have less subscribers and the ones who are left will be the most valuable to advertisers (i.e. they have the most disposable income). If you decrease the subscription fee, you will have more subscribers but not a lot more, because the primary obstacle for online subscription type services for most people is not the price but the <i>idea</i> of paying for something they are accustomed to getting for free.<p>So if you get 1000 people to pay $1.00 per month for your niche Swedish grunge music streaming service and double the price, a decent number of them will not like that and some of them will unsubscribe. But if you halve the price to $0.50 per month you won&#x27;t see many new customers since many people aren&#x27;t willing to pay even small amounts for music streaming. Advertisers, meanwhile, don&#x27;t have these mental obstacles and just try to price things as objectively as possible. And they see a narrowly targeted list of people with a highly correlated list of interests and purchasing tendencies and value it appropriately.<p>This might explain why services like Hulu have gradually introduced more advertising into their paid subscription services. As long as two groups of people are are paying them (customers and advertisers) one will generally be willing to pay more. Economic forces on the internet seem to result in advertisers having more purchasing power here.",1438095048

Say, for example, in Germany credit cards are not that common (other methods, like SEPA direct debit are used). Or they are in principle willing to pay, but not for the product that is offered (say, because of DRM or watermarks). Or they would pay, but don&#x27;t trust their credit card number to some small, dubious website. Or they would pay, but are afraid of some hidden usage terms for the website that implies some kind of subscription (and thus future payments) that you don&#x27;t want.<p>TLDR: There are lots of other reasons that can explain, why people would love to pay, but don&#x27;t.",1438094834

Sorry you were let go, but that is just business, they need people with more experience and likely learned the hard way that they can&#x27;t pay lower prices for less experience and expect things to work out.  That really isn&#x27;t a reflection on you or your abilities so much as it is on them for bad planning.

Take a few days and chill and have some fun, spend a little time brushing up your resume and start sending them out.  There are a lot of positions available.  Remember this, when you are applying for jobs you are selling yourself and what you can do for the company.  So many times I interview developers and they don&#x27;t realize that they need to sell themselves.  I am not talking about being a sleazy used car salesman, but recognizing you have to tell people what you are capable of and be able to back it up with mastery of some set of skills.<p>Last point, you mentioned you are to early to have specialized.  I totally disagree with this approach but others may have different opinions.  I think you should specialize in a couple of key areas, generally for someone with 1-2 years experience I expect them to know a single language quite well, have a little knowledge of others and be able to do some data queries in SQL (or the database they have been using) etc.  I want new hires to have some depth not as much breadth, it is important to get a wide span of knowledge, but it is even more important to go deep in a couple of areas.  You have plenty of time to master multiple skills, but focus first as it makes you more valuable.  For a web dev, I&#x27;d expect decent JS, css, and whatever their front end language is to be fairly mastered in terms of syntax and core coding.  I wouldn&#x27;t expect advanced topics like concurrency or nuances of debugging yet (unless they have been heavily mentored).<p>Good luck, you should have plenty of runway depending on where you are at in the country, and whether you are willing to relocate.",1438094816

This is merely saying that you believe in Everett style interpretations, which have so far failed to explain the appearance of non-linear processes in quantum mechanics satisfactorily.<p>Decoherence does _not_ solve the quantum measurement problem. You can not derive the Born rule.<p>Basically what decoherence does for you is translate a quantum amplitude on the space of operators into a classical distribution on the spectrum of your coupling. It does not tell you why you are allowed to interpret this distribution as a probability distribution.
It does not tell you why you should be able to say that the state with higher amplitude is more likely to occur. In decoherence all states occur. So it is even unclear a priori what should be meant by the probability of a state occurring.<p>This is not my private opinion, this is the opinion of people like Zeh, who was instrumental in developing our current understanding of decoherence:<p>&quot;[Decoherence] would explain why we never observe an apparatus pointing, say, to two different results, i.e. decoherence would provide a solution to the measurement problem of quantum mechanics.

Every two months somebody tries it and then discovers why it doesn&#x27;t work.<p>For almost all the smaller buildings in New York (non-professionally managed), which is where you see these middlemen brokers:<p>* The brokers are given an exclusive by the landlords because the landlords are not professionals and often not in New York City. They don&#x27;t want to do any work, they want the brokers to do the work of listing the apartment, showing the apartment, and checking the qualifications of the tenant.<p>* The landlord has to give the broker an exclusive otherwise the broker won&#x27;t do the work, because the broker needs to get paid.<p>* Although the broker fee (normally 15% of first year rent) seems expensive and even extortionate to the typical fresh college grad renting their first apartment, the brokers as a whole are not making very much money, because they have to do an awful lot of work to get the exclusives (marketing themselves to landlords, so to speak) and an awful lot of work to coordinate keys, show apartments, etc. It is easy to see this because there is massive turnover in the broker business and almost all of the rental brokers you see in New York charging &quot;extortionate&quot; fees are, for the most part, broke.<p>* Which is why they seem so slimy: they&#x27;re kinda desperate.<p>* A ton of apartments in New York are still under some form of rent control, especially the cheap ones in small buildings that kids want. That means that the maximum rent is set by law. So even if a tenant MIGHT be willing to pay a higher rent if they didn&#x27;t have to pay the brokerage fee, they can&#x27;t. The landlord of a $1800 rent stabilized apartment is going to get $1800/month whether they use a broker or not. So for this landlord, the broker is paid for by the tenant, and might as well be free. Considering how much work they do, and how much they charge, zero, it&#x27;s a great deal for the landlord.<p>So every time one of these fresh-eyed college grads shows up in New York, decides that the rental brokers are making bank and need to be disintermediated, and writes an App that will Connect the Landlord Directly to the Tenant, no landlords sign up for it. The bottom line is that the brokerage function is not ripe for disruption because, slimy as it seems, there&#x27;s just not that much money being made.",1438094001

And because they are able to shell out two months worth of rent for the broker&#x27;s fee and deposit I get someone financially more sound and likely less crazy.<p>Oh and one of our places is a Coop, good luck filling out a 80 page form and going through the coop board interview without a broker! That&#x27;s a full time job, all the same paperwork as if you&#x27;re buying a place. My current couple of renters had to supply 12 (twelve) letters of personal reference, 6 each!<p>Another problem is that the renters &quot;know&quot; about the broker&#x27;s fee but don&#x27;t really consider it as part of the rental &quot;price&quot;. Psychologically they don&#x27;t add up those numbers, divide by 12 and say this is my rent. Apartment prices don&#x27;t vary at all whether you are using a broker or not, at least not in my experience.",1438093959

You could have more control over noise in urban areas.

Engines that are replaceable in a few hours.

Not to mention all the other tooling in software like Ansible, Chef, etc.<p>For networking: if you&#x27;re running all your containers on one VM (as most developers do), it&#x27;s not a big deal. But if you need containers on multiple servers, you not only have to deal with the servers&#x27; configuration, provisioning, and networking, but also the containers inside, and getting them to play nicely through the servers&#x27; networks. It&#x27;s akin to running multiple VMs on one physical machine, but without using tools like VMWare or VirtualBox to manage the networking aspects.<p>Networking is challenging, but at least we have a lot of experience with VMs, which are conceptually similar.

Accurately describing your product only prevents people who aren&#x27;t really your target -- like me -- from being disappointed and telling the world about it, while it helps attract precisely those people who would be most excited about it.<p>Also, I think Typesafe realize now that there is not much money to be made in developing and supporting a programming language (ironically, there is some to be made -- though not too much -- supporting specialist languages; see Ada and Matlab). That&#x27;s why they want to change their name, right?<p>> no users = no dice; doubt either will grab much mindshare in the near-term.<p>That&#x27;s splitting hairs a bit; Scala doesn&#x27;t exactly have mass appeal either. We&#x27;re talking about the difference between tiny and small.<p>> I doubt Kotlin will be able to deliver the same guarantees, but if it can, watch out Oracle.<p>I know they&#x27;re trying to. Also, I know Oracle actively encourages alternative JVM languages. Their product is the Java platform, which currently -- to be honest -- is not too far from being the same as Java the language (all alternative JVM languages combined don&#x27;t amount to 10%, or possibly even 5% of the JVM ecosystem). But they wouldn&#x27;t mind if that changes. Their research team working on Graal, HotSpot&#x27;s next-gen JIT, coming to OpenJDK in Java 9, spends as much time on making sure it runs Ruby, R, C, Python, and JavaScript well as it does on making sure it runs Java well. I know Oracle&#x27;s Java team isn&#x27;t all too happy about it, but I also know that that&#x27;s what Oracle wants.",1438092699

I don&#x27;t know, it&#x27;s extremely popular, but faces interesting regulatory risk.  I think it&#x27;ll do okay.<p>DropBox and Stripe?  Competitive spaces.  Maybe they make it, maybe they don&#x27;t.  I can&#x27;t see them being &quot;moated&quot; (in the parlance of Buffet) leaders in their respective businesses.  But I&#x27;ve been wrong many times.<p>><i>&quot;but as long as the entire category of &quot;technology&quot; doesn&#x27;t collapse altogether</i>&quot;<p>I guess that&#x27;s our point of contention:  I think it <i>does</i> go down together, rational or not.  We just witnessed something similar in the oil industry.  Everyone collapsed, whether they were big, small, hedged or otherwise not directly affected by the collapse in oil price.  That happens in a panic because nobody can tell the extent of the risk.<p>><i>And given the amount of real profits</i><p>I agree that, as oposed to DotCom 1.0, companies are generating revenues.  But, again, where are the &quot;real&quot; profits?  Google, sure, but they are transitioning from growth to value.  Facebook&#x27;s are minimal.  I don&#x27;t think any other company you have named is making money.  Granted, it doesn&#x27;t <i>necessarily</i> matter for &quot;early stage&quot; behemoths like Uber or AirBnB, but that doesn&#x27;t make the profit claim true.",1438092320

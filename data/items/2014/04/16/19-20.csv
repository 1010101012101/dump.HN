Also, it&#x27;s compulsory investment and savings -- both with the principal payment and in the form of property improvements.</i><p>I&#x27;d need to see a lot more justification before accepting that leveraged investments are a net positive either for individuals or for society. In general, leverage increases variability while reducing expected value in the form of interest payments. In other words it is analytically opposite of insurance.<p>I do agree that program or automatic savings are a positive &quot;nudge&quot; both for individuals and for society, but there&#x27;s nothing but status quo bias that says that this asset class has to be the heavily favored vehicle for that.<p><i>While it&#x27;s true that we incentivize home ownership, possibly too much, I think it&#x27;s unfair that you paint it as an otherwise neutral activity that we strangely endorse with public policy. Land has real value, you can live on (and off) it. It was long seen as the one enduring source of wealth (See John Adams, George Washington, etc). It&#x27;s much deeper than our postwar tax policies.</i><p>Prior to the industrial revolution land was the primary means of production. Today that&#x27;s no longer true, and the vast vast majority of real property (by value not acre) is not used as an input factor for goods. The best translation of those classic references to the importance of land ownership today are modern means of production (e.g. ownership shares in productive businesses), not a quarter-acre of lawn in the suburbs.<p>Governments ought to be encouraging investment in positive sum productive enterprises, not zero sum positional goods. And at least as a default bias for non-wealthy citizens it ought to encourage holding diversified portfolios of assets with transparent liquid markets and low transaction costs.",1397678319

Microsoft seems pretty good about it, and has good tools available, though it might vary a lot from team to team. Smaller companies? I&#x27;ve at times been revered as a testing deity when showing someone code coverage results. Other companies know what the word &quot;coverage&quot; means, but seldom know about or utilize the tools available. They just know they probably ought to do it, which is a step ahead, I guess.<p>Where I&#x27;m currently at, my manager wanted code coverage but needed someone to do it. Since I&#x27;m just that guy, I setup the infrastructure for iOS. Android, you&#x27;re such a pain in the ass to setup for (rooted device, or the dog-slow emulator, and it still doesn&#x27;t give me results) I&#x27;m surprised anyone does code coverage for Android. I can&#x27;t remember the name of the python tool, but holy smokes it&#x27;s slick and painless.<p>So tooling quality varies, which might have a lot to do with the lack of coverage testing. I long for the days of the coverage tool Tim Paterson wrote (yeah, that Tim Paterson). No profiling, it would inject the coverage DLL at runtime. Then, as you used the program, it would log coverage on the fly. So program running on one monitor, coverage log on the other, and start clicking. Can&#x27;t remember the name of it (it&#x27;s no longer sold by Paterson Technologies), but damn it was slick.",1397678258

7600158,comment,7599612,7599612,3,0,ctoestreich,,,"I will post this here as well for posterity.  I appreciate the time you took to compare and contrast the frameworks and your article is very thorough. We started with backbone on a few large projects and found angular late. We have switched to using angular where ever possible given the reduced code and testability.<p>I think another good comparison to make that is missing from both demo application stacks is testing. It becomes increasingly difficult to test backbone with the side effects of having jQuery selectors, html elements and general DOM operations directly in your view models. One of the great advantages of angular is it&#x27;s attempt to make invert your thinking about dom binding compared to other frameworks. Meaning it tries to keep the DOM and the MVVM separated so there aren&#x27;t unintended side effects if you add or change html node ids or classes. Backbone more tightly couples you to a specific html model and makes testing your javascript code complex and coupled to also looking for changes to the physical DOM during tests.<p>In the end, the more complex problems see to cause equal headaches in both frameworks, but at least angular give you less lines of headaches.",1397678114

7600154,comment,7597502,7597502,2,0,bane,,,"I&#x27;d add that one of the token mistakes out of towners make when setting up shop in &quot;D.C.&quot; is to take the name literally. For example, if your target is in the Fed/Defense space, D.C. is paradoxically probably not the best place to set up an office. Good luck getting people from McLean, Reston or Springfield or even Ft. Meade to want to come to a meeting at your office, no/expensive parking, mass transit doesn&#x27;t work for most places outside of D.C. (and no bureaucrat worth their departmental budget is going to take it anyway).<p>The Baltimore/D.C. metro area should be considered as a whole (about 10 million people!) and for the obvious benefits of being near your customers or for the synergy effects of being near like-businesses, you <i>have</i> to get to know the area and should setup shop in those places if you can. <i>Nobody</i> in the Fed/Defense Space is impressed that you set up an office in a trendy D.C. neighborhood.<p>Want to work high tech? The Dulles Tech corridor is where you should look. That&#x27;s Virginia and goes 30 miles away from the city. It&#x27;s the Silicon Valley of the East and it&#x27;s slowly getting setup on the Metro system. Want to work bio? You want Southern Maryland.<p>I&#x27;ve lived in the D.C. area for a very long time and I see this mistake repeated again and again. D.C. means the entire region. D.C. (the city) is a very different thing. It also means that you&#x27;re constantly dealing with the three territories here, VA, MD and D.C. and things are different in each of them, even if nominally they&#x27;re one big area.<p>The other one I see is that everybody from out of the area underestimates the intensity and vagueness of D.C. traffic. I&#x27;ve seen a long list of West Coasters, who think they understand traffic from around the Bay Area slowly slip into madness when it comes to facing and dealing with D.C. traffic. It means that you can&#x27;t setup a long string of meetings all over the area and expect that Google Maps&#x27;s estimate of 15 minutes will make any kind of sense. On one day it&#x27;ll be right, and the next it&#x27;ll turn into an hour and a half slog and you&#x27;ll blow through your next 3 meetings just trying to get to them.<p>D.C. is also very much perception based. You&#x27;re either with the in-crowd or you&#x27;re an outsider. And these two mistakes mark you as an outsider, a rookie and not a player to very many of the big organizations you might be wanting to do business with.",1397678086

7600131,comment,7599397,7600095,4,0,alanh,,,"You’re both right, to some degree. While you are correct that the eyes focus at a certain depth, much like a camera, the difference is that we can chose to focus at any depth (assuming good eyesight). This is not true of a photograph if it has no depth. (It’s also true that, if the photograph has both fore and background in focus, edges may be harder to pick out and depth harder to discern, even though we would have no trouble with our own eyes. That’s the basis of much trick photography, after all!)<p><i>All</i> photos are unnatural. To quote the artist (and, dare I say, photographer) David Hockney: “I mean, photography is all right if you don’t mind looking at the world from the point of view of a paralyzed cyclops—for a split second.”<p>At risk of this becoming too long-winded, allow me to point out another “normal” variable of photography that is wholly unnatural (beyond the issue of focus and the fact that one moment is extended to infinity): Shutter speeds faster than 1/150s or slower than 0.5s. Our own eyes will never see the individual blade of a helicopter so clearly as a simple iPhone camera will when shot against a bright sky. Nor will naked eye see a waterfall as a blurry, peaceful average the way a long exposure portrays it.",1397677899

I end up needing to jump through hoops in order to safeguard an amateur that doesn&#x27;t know what he&#x27;s doing.<p>This Apple bug was a failure on many levels. This was one of the most beginner-level bugs imaginable, on one of the most important libraries imaginable. Where was the programmer accountability? Where was the internal review process for this change? Where was the static code analysis to catch this block of unreachable code? Where was the security auditing suite to make sure the library was functioning as intended? Where was the corporate accountability? Blaming the tool for being sharp, to me, sounds like passing the blame entirely.<p>The {} enforcement is, solely by itself, very benign. It doesn&#x27;t remove any language functionality or expressiveness, and it&#x27;s a good thing to do anyway. Aside from requiring us to go back and patch up decades of old code, it&#x27;s in a very rare category of <i>easy</i> wins. From it, you could easily say the same about always explicitly casting everything, so that there are no surprises. And put all your literals on the left-hand side, in case someone forgets an extra =.<p>if(!x) a = b * c + d;<p>if(0u == x) {\n  a = reinterpret_cast<int>(b) * c + reinterpret_cast<int>(d);\n}<p>The code does exactly the same thing, yet the latter is going to have a real toll on code readability.

But it adds up.<p>Yet what I&#x27;m most afraid of, is that I&#x27;m very hard-pressed to think of safety changes to C that won&#x27;t remove any functionality, aside from the aforementioned. In fact, I start seeing odd things creep up, like Clang warning when switching on a boolean value. It apparently catches some odd mistake some guy made at some point. It was thought that nobody would ever switch on a boolean. Except that I did. (see my post history here if you want details on that.) I&#x27;m getting a bit tired of being grouped in with programmers like the goto fail guy. Sure I&#x27;m not perfect, but I&#x27;m also not making these kinds of trivial mistakes.

A total of 1,923 cases met four criteria: dichotomous pro/con responses, specificity about policy, relevance to federal government decisions, and categorical rather than conditional phrasing. Of those 1,923 original cases, 1,779 cases also met the criteria of providing income breakdowns for respondents, not involving a Constitutional amendment or a Supreme Court ruling (which might entail a quite different policy making process), and involving a clear, as opposed to partial or ambiguous, actual presence or absence of policy change. These 1,779 cases do not constitute a sample from the universe of all possible policy alternatives (this is hardly conceivable), but we see them as particularly relevant to assessing the public’s influence on policy. The included policies are not restricted to the narrow Washington “policy agenda.” At the same time – since they were seen as worth asking poll questions about – they tend to concern matters of relatively high salience, about which it is plausible that average citizens may have real opinions and may exert some political influence.</i>",1397677645

Calculate the amount of movement between the matching features to then calculate the depth.<p>As described you then map the depth into an alpha transparency  and then apply the blurred image with various blur strength over the original image.<p>Since you&#x27;re able to apply the blur after the image, it would mean the google camera always takes more than one photo.<p>Also a Cool feature would be to animate the transition from no blur to DOF blur as a short clip or use the depth perception to apply different effect than just blur, like selective coloring, or other filters.",1397677139

The problem is, that there are many ways in which it matters, and some of those come at the expense of others.<p>A language may be more concise, leading to shorter code (which is good), but do so using tricks and &quot;magic&quot; that is hard to follow, which makes it, eventually less prone to analysis by others (which is bad). A language could be very declarative, thus clearly communicating intent (which is good), but do so with leaky abstractions that remove it away from the computer&#x27;s view of things, and introduce subtle, and severe bugs that, in order to catch, require expertise in exactly <i>how</i> the language is implemented (which is bad).<p>So while there are certainly languages which are categorically better than others (at least for some domains), there is no consensus on the right path to choose among the &quot;better languages&quot;, and they all take completely opposing approaches. I&#x27;d even say that most languages used in new code written today are among those &quot;better languages&quot;. So while in theory the choice of the programming language matters a lot, in practice -- not so much (as long as you choose one of the many good languages). I don&#x27;t think that we have a language (or several) that is <i>that much</i> better at preventing bugs as to offset any other advantages other languages may have.",1397677139

My team stopped considering resumes from any boot camp participants, unless they had an engineering background.<p>What I think&#x27;s going on is that many of them want to found startups, so they want to be technical enough to launch prototypes, give investor confidence, etc. but they don&#x27;t want to invest much further than that. And I think that&#x27;s ultimately a problematic approach, as it&#x27;s not going to be good for the people that hire you, and not good for the startup you found either, thinking of the recent poster who, as a &#x27;technical cofounder&#x27;, is being squeezed out of his company by the CTO because he&#x27;s just not good enough.<p>I read in another comment this survey did not prevent multiple voting, so I&#x27;m sharing my opinion here as it&#x27;s unclear if the survey will be skewed.",1397676662

I have never coded an entire site by hand, but I built this entire responsive site in Webflow. This WYSIWYG doesn&#x27;t disregard how the web works - users actually have to know some CSS to build a responsive layout. This restriction limits a lot of Average Joe&#x27;s (so no Geocities here). I actually learned all the intricacies of CSS by building sites in Webflow. Same goes for the designers out there using tool and building actual sites for the first time.<p>It boils down to investment and return. If designers can build responsive sites faster and easier with great code output (see source code) using a WYSIWYG, then it makes more sense to invest in that versus learning how to write the same code. Front end devs use frameworks like Bootstrap and Foundation to cut development time. Webflow serves the same purpose, but all the framework components are made visual.<p>This visual abstraction makes it more accessible for more people just like these frameworks made web dev easier.

That&#x27;s not surprising to me in a republican system: Elites are the ones getting elected! This is not necessarily a bug if you think voters are better as judges of character, values and capability than as issue-by-issue decision makers. The authors disagree, though I think they describe the other side of the argument uncharitably:<p><i>A possible objection to populistic democracy is that average citizens are inattentive to politics and ignorant about public policy; why should we worry if their poorly informed preferences do not influence policy making? Perhaps economic elites and interest group leaders enjoy greater policy expertise than the average citizen does. Perhaps they know better which policies will benefit everyone, and perhaps they seek the common good, rather than selfish ends, when deciding which policies to support.</i><p><i>But we tend to doubt it.

Attempting to use the Nullable where an Option is expected would fail to parse.

7599787,comment,7598564,7598564,16,0,josho,,,"I wonder what the broader implications are of this bill. Is the bill broad enough that if I detect an IP address connect to my business SSH server does that afford me the privilege to obtain the customer information from the IP address?<p>Think about that for a moment, as a business owner I can now send a request to any ISP that owns an IP address that connected to my website. Why do I need your customer information, why because I did not authorize the IP access to /index.html, and the IP address showed repeated attempts connecting and using my computer resources (of course to the ISP I make it sound a little more sinister, like embed an image tag to a resource like /employee-portal/login so that I can tell the ISP the unauthorized access was to the employee portal, and of course that image tag will result in generating requests in my server logs to show the repeated requests from the IP trying to fetch that resource. Poof now I have the name and phone number for everyone that has been to my business website and is potentially interested in what I&#x27;m selling.. Of course, I won&#x27;t tell the individual how I got their phone number. I wouldn&#x27;t practice this, but for a morally corrupt business it sounds viable.<p>If the above is possible by the bill, and from the articles that I&#x27;ve read it is, then this bill strikes me as particularly stupid legislation bought for by moneyed interests. I can only hope that our government isn&#x27;t so corrupted by those moneyed interests that this thing passes.",1397674898

Me or both of us clean up the mess and I just print them out again.

The child has to have reached a certain age to grasp that my anger is mostly about my stress and not about the actions of the kid (specificially the ability to empathize has to be developed).<p>tl;dr: What I meant with consistency is mostly the parents having a certain amount of affect control.

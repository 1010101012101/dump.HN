To make that performant you have to hack in things like manual memory management and use type coercions to game existing engine behavior. To get full performance you need significant engine changes including a mode switch, validation step, and special purpose compiler. And of course, the JS as IR doesn't really qualify as human readable in any meaningful sense.<p>And I happily admit that type coercions and similar tricks are a very clever way to structure your IR while simultaneously maintaining compatibility and improving performance in existing JS engines. However, in doing so you're already relying heavily on unspecced implementation details of existing engines.<p>So, my point is that it's a hack... a really brilliant hack that might actually be the best path forward for a universal IR on the Web. But it's still a hack, and it brings with it some serious pain points that still need to be resolved.",1364565591

5460706,comment,5459023,5459023,14,0,dmbaggett,,,"Fred Wilson says: <i>The first is the ""slog it out"" scenario. This one is in many ways the most painful. It means that there is a business that can be built, but it won't be one that makes the VCs much money and because it takes so much time and money to ""slog it out"", it doesn't make the entrepreneur much money either.</i><p>This, in a nutshell, explains the problem with uniformly applying the VC model to all tech startups. Some tech startups -- often the ones involving creation of substantive new technology with deep intrinsic value -- require many years of slogging. There's nothing wrong with startups like that as long as there is a way to fund them to completion. But how to do that?<p>The problem is that the standard VC model doesn't really fit well for these startups, because the VCs by necessity have fixed, relatively short time horizons.<p>The VC-funded startups that do work well despite involving slogging and deep innovation generally seem to hit some vein of gold along the way -- e.g., Google ""discovering"" the psychological fact that consumer click-through rates are vastly higher for search ads than for other online ads, despite initially targeting enterprise search sales. This ""gold strike"" propels these companies to very rapid, hockey-stick growth that funds the vast investment required to build the new technology. But they seem <i>a priori</i> unpredictable, which is troubling if you're looking for a repeatable model of success.<p>At ITA Software we ""slogged it out"" from ~1997 to 2010 and created $700M of value for shareholders; in contrast to the typical scenario Fred describes, it did very well for both entrepreneurs and the VCs (as well as for many of the employees). But we'd likely have exhausted the patience of our VCs had we raised money in 1997 rather than in 2006, and come to a rather different end. (We actually did look into raising from VCs circa 2000, but the terms offered were so bad we declined.)<p>Likewise, imagine trying to make what ultimately became Siri with a VC partner. SRI spent tens of millions of dollars on that project over a very long period of time. (I remember seeing a talk on it at AAAI in 2007, at which point it was already pretty mature, and had cost -- if I recall correctly -- $40M, but was still years away from being acquired by Apple.)<p>To be clear: I'm not saying the VC model is bad; I'm just saying it's not universally applicable. And I honestly don't know what to tell entrepreneurs who want to create companies that don't fit the model well, unless they are already rich enough to self-fund, in which case I ask if I can invest. :)",1364565334

I have rebuilt an engine, I have changed timing belts, oil pumps, water pumps, A/C systems, spark plugs, wires, changed timing on older cars, changed sensors, figured out why a car wasn't running properly. Even today I still have the ability to listen to a car and with almost 80% accuracy know what is wrong with it.

More people driving means greater demand for parking, which means buildings get torn down for lots and parking structures. Nodes of activity spread farther apart, so more people drive, and drive more often, further increasing demand for parking. The result is a country of paved-over cities with more parking spaces than people [0].<p>Driverless cars have the potential to break the feedback loop by decoupling destinations from nearby parking, shifting parking out of central cities and freeing land for all the things that make urban living great.

Personally I'd be happy if the surface differences between humans were really just nothing more than cosmetics, rather than a non-negligible statistical correlate to other quite desirable/undesirable traits.

Furthermore, having ""minimum reliance on an external authority"" would increase this risk, so long as humans as a species remain at the same general intelligence on the cross-species intelligence scale. It is a good thing that things such as nukes or highly contagious, highly deadly research viruses are entirely, maximally dependent on an authoritative process within each country that has them that you nor I have any influence over. It is a good thing high-energy physics experiments are restricted to the elite. Authority, and maximal reliance on it, aren't necessarily always bad. When humans become transhumans I'll likely think the average person should have far greater power--and therefore responsibility.<p>By population control, I'm not so much concerned about overpopulation being a problem as I am of people in general giving birth when they probably shouldn't. All things equal more life is better than no life--an example of unequal being no life better than a life filled with 30 seconds of torture then extinguished--so nested in that I prefer ""better"" life over ""worse"" life, which I'm purposefully leaving undefined in the specifics (partly because I'm not certain myself about whether certain traits are better, worse, or insignificant, and whether and how much that value changes depending on the number of people with such traits). The earth can support many more humans, it's a shame highly intelligent people aren't having more/any kids. And when the earth does reach its limit, neighboring planets and beyond will be able to solve that problem.",1364564942

I was expecting a $2k bill for the level of treatment I had that night, not $10k.<p>However, there's an understanding of being poor that can never be explained to somebody who never has <i>been</i> poor. There's a quality of the thing that can never really be conveyed (all personal true stories): The near monthly 3am panic attack that wakes you up even though you're 20 hours behind on sleep for the week, deciding that ""no, the $1.50 menu items are too expensive"", buying food by weight/cost with considerations made for non-perishability, wearing the last pair of pants you have left and hoping they last for 3 more months because you passed out from exhaustion and tore your other pair beyond repair on the way down. It means never taking a sick day, because the $40 you'd lose that day would mean you couldn't pay rent -- even though your cough clearly lets you know it's pneumonia. It means that you save every piece of plastic container you can get your hands on because you can't afford dishes, or dashing out of a fast food restaurant with handfuls of plasticware so you can stop eating your oatmeal with your hands. It means using the remains of your second to last pair of pants as reusable napkins over your dinner of canned corn (discontinued 20 for a $1!) and half of the ten pack of Ramen you scored at the dollar store that you're trying to stretch with more water. It means seriously considering stealing enough ketchup packages on your way out with the plasticware that you might be able to get a tomato soup broth going. Being poor is not having a TV and digging through your apartment complex's trash to find furniture you can patch up. It means that for the first year of your marriage you have a mattress, and no other furniture, you spend your nights sitting on the floor trying to keep your 7 year old discount computer alive with spare parts and literal duct tape or you'll fail school. It means not buying any textbooks and then scouring campus for lost smartcards so you can copy the relevant readings out of somebody else's book...it means not having a cell phone or a landline phone, it means paying an extra $100 a month in rent so you have a place to live because your credit score is abysmal and the property manager thought you looked honest and he'd make an exception this time, it's trying to find a way to score a bottle of free modafinil from a friend with sleep apnea so you can take a night shift at the local grocery loading dock twice a a week...it's having a guy almost murdered in the apartment below you buy a homeless man he invited in to drink and do drugs in exchange for sex, and thrice weekly police showing up at your building, it's hearing shots fired on the other side of the firewall in the building next to yours, it's picking through slices of cheese or fruit to cut out the moldy bits so you can still eat it, it's getting a $.50 an hour raise an thinking immediately about how you might be able to buy a new pair of pants a month earlier, and calculating how many hours you have to work to make up for what each and every meal costs.<p>That was my life for about two years and most of it stayed true for another four after that.<p>In my area a $900/mo apartment was the cheapest possible option short of renting a room out of somebody's home (which ran around $500-700, but afforded no quiet place to study, no private restroom and were all an additional 10-20 miles from school and work. Crunching the numbers and the additional fuel cost, plus the driving time (which simply didn't exist) would have <i>almost</i> equalled out. My other choice was homeless shelter, but it cost $20/night or $600 a month and there was no place I could store my books or computer.<p>One thing I hear a lot of is that poor people should go to school or improve themselves so that they don't stay poor. It took round the clock discipline, 7 days a week, for 6 years to make that happen in our case. I doubt that most people could do that on such a sustained basis.<p>I know that I couldn't have done it on my own. There were many dozens of times that I almost threw in the towel, and my wife almost did the same -- but we picked each other up when we needed it and made it happen.<p>In the end I only did it because I was tired of growing up poor and living poor, and getting shitty jobs and..just...being poor and watching others get opportunities I would never see just because I was born into the wrong family...indignant rage carried me through.<p>I have permanent scars from those days. My lungs are permanently scarred from a case of pneumonia I carried around with me while working for six weeks before my wife finally forced me to go see a family doctor (who gave me free antibiotics and an almost free visit out of the kindness of his heart) -- I pretty much can't do cardio exercises. The stress was so bad that it weakened my immune system, and gave me some mild nerve damage in my face and problems with my pancreas I'll carry for life. I have night sweats most nights, and recurring nightmares of suddenly going bankrupt and being poor again. I had two mild untreated breaks in my hands that didn't heal quite correctly, leading to permanent pain and reduced mobility. I have ulcers making coffee and other acidic drinks painful to drink. I had an untreated stye in my left eye that left my eyelid permanently thin, meaning when I close my eyes, I can still see light in that eye.<p>Nothing I've ever experienced since can hold a candle to the stress of that time, not being in warzones, not having friends die, not even living the life of a startup.",1364564178

Suppose you lived in the alternate universe where you didn't have a stepfather and learned everything from your birth father.  Who would you have learned the skills from then?  The problem with relying on passing handiness down from generation to generation is that once it fails to propagate for a generation, it's very hard to get back.<p>It's hard to find a teacher for adults for handy skills, and a lot of being handy comes from having long term exposure to handiness anyway.  Taking a weekend class (if one exists) or reading a book from the library on how to hang cabinets (for example) isn't going to cover all of the possible gotchas that could come up.  Some of those gotchas are probably best solved by people with a lot of experience hanging cabinets, but there are probably others that you could probably solve if you've lived a generally handy life.<p>If this sounds like institutional knowledge, that's probably a fair comparison.  It's just that the family is a very small institution that doesn't necessarily have a lot of redundancy in who has the institutional knowledge.  Once you lose it, it's pretty much lost, and that's the reason to have a shop class in school.  It provides a mechanism to add that knowledge to families that don't have it from a (hopefully) experienced person who has enough time in contact with his or her students to impart more knowledge directly and pass on general handiness as a mindset rather that a specific skill.",1364563249

Those four blocks aren't overwritten.

Ask anybody who has the misfortune to work on a filesystem for any length of time.<p>One thing to keep in mind is that ZFS is more complex than your typical filesystem, but it's also one of the few filesystems that's effectively a cryptographically self-validating tree. You're a lot more likely to have a disk lie to you than ZFS flake out.",1364562536

If you already know which assumptions always hold you have a significant advantage at the start: simpler faster and more compact code and the chance for better ""global"" optimizations.

To an extent I'm okay with the idea of people following their preferences, but the fact is that the market is being undermined by municipalities in this case. All those land owners in San Francisco are halting further development of the city, driving prices artificially through the roof and driving people who might prefer to be in a more urban setting into the suburban wasteland. Where at least now they can tool around in their robotic cars. Fucking wonderful.<p>On a less bitter note: as someone who lives in the future (future circa 1930) and spends 0% of his day in unproductive commuting, you west coast folks are in for a treat in 20-25 years when (if) this happens. That extra hour or so a day of unstructured time to read, surf the net, or just veg is really wonderful.",1364562432

If I turn off my adblocker, I see an <i>enormous</i> Google ad for some kind of cancer medication. I wouldn't be surprised if this is a very expensive keyword. I'm curious how the website creator triggered this ad -- unless Google is hinting that I have cancer.",1196072394

This is the portable reader/personal slate equivalent of the TRS-80. It's ugly and some of it's features are a pain in the ass, and the only way to find out what works and what doesn't is to throw it out there and see what people complain about.<p>Which I guess is one of Scoble's strengths.<p>I suspect the Kindle team think their product could have benefited from another year of development and that crucial features were cut from the schedule and that the BOM was more costly than they thought, and I'm interested in seeing what version two looks like.

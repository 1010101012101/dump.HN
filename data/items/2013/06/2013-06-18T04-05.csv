5897635,comment,5895887,5897420,4,0,bobwaycott,,,"I, too, think it is a vital distinction. Sadly, I think the government is relying on ambiguous language in the Patriot Act (and subsequent reauthorization amendments) to bypass typical warrant restrictions.<p>If I were on the legal team interpreting the laws and their intent as it surrounds intelligence gathering, I&#x27;d see one widely open door--the Patriot act allowed for the searching of email and telephone communication records, and National Security Letters allow law enforcement to use these letters to investigate US citizens, <i>even when they are not suspected of committing a crime</i>, and absolve them of the requirement to obtain a warrant before searching &quot;records&quot;.<p>Given that much of the debate is centering on conceptions of records, collecting, intercepting, databases, metadata, etc., I would guess there&#x27;s a significant probability that the NSA et al. interpret the Patriot Act in such a way that the widespread collection of records is well within the dictates of the law and does not run afoul of the any legal requirements.<p>Where databases owned by private companies are concerned, I expect those fall under established warrant procedures that require law enforcement to stipulate the need to search and seize such records from the companies when a proper warrant is issued declaring the specific items to be seized and from where. So, I would guess that a legal challenge against government access to databases kept by major companies would be a rather Sisyphean battle, given warrant case law and precedents. Of course, with warrants, the suspected party is, I believe, able to be notified/aware of the warranted search & seizure. With NSLs, however, the Patriot Act lifted that, creating instead a much more attractive (to law enforcement & intelligence agencies, at least) vehicle that carries an automatic gag order.<p>The real issue is government access to those records <i>en masse</i> and without standing warrants specifically detailing the targets of collection. And here is where we start wading into creative interpretation of (possibly intentional) ambiguously worded legislation granting expansive powers to search records without a warrant, records which can now include telephone and email correspondence, as well as other records which have been commonplace in the last several decades of warrant issues.",1371531244

5897628,comment,5897458,5897458,6,0,edias,,,"A interesting comparison I think is between Starcraft 1 (1998) and Stacraft 2 (2010). In the original Starcraft you were constantly fighting against the game engine. Unit pathing, spell casting and a several glitches which players could utilize (most notably mutalisk stacking) made the game incredibly challenging to do anything, let alone pull off complex strategies. The speed at which you could perform actions was crucial to being a top player. Stacraft 2 introduced several mechanics that made the game substantially easier. Multiple building selection allowing you to produce units from several buildings at once rather than selecting each individually. Increased unit selection from 12 to 255, the max you would realistically expect to hit. Better unit pathing so players need to focus less on army control and numerous other changes.<p>The down side of this is that many argue the mechanical difficulty of SC1 helped make the game so competitive and the sequel is inferior in that sense, which I agree with but think there are numerous other reasons for that as well.<p>If any of you want me to expand on or explain anything just let me know. Starcraft is really the only thing I talk about on the internet.<p>Edit* This is what I mean by mechanical difficulty [1]. RTS games, especially the Stacraft series, are extremely difficult just by the nature of the game.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4UTDudShDY"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4UTDudShDY</a>",1371531137

5897609,comment,5895672,5896124,19,0,robomartin,,,"> I&#x27;m continually surprised by how few software engineers in industry spend the time to pick up HDL and FPGA programming in general.<p>While I appreciate your sentiment, it isn&#x27;t programming, it&#x27;s hardware design.  To do anything beyond the somewhat trivial you need to learn a pile of EE stuff.  Thinking of FPGA&#x27;s as software might be nice, but that&#x27;s not reality.  Some examples of this are signal integrity, metastability, transmission lines, propagation delays, timing closure, SSO, etc.  And that&#x27;s the tip of the iceberg.  You can&#x27;t just shove in a 600MHz clock, write something that looks like software and expect the darn thing to work.  I once spent nearly three months chasing a 3 nanosecond timing problem on a complex design.  The &quot;code&quot; was perfect.  It was a layout, routing and timing problem.  FPGA&#x27;s are not software.<p>Of course, this is assuming an EE has done the hard work of designing a solid board with all the right I/O, interfaces as well as the all the initialization and setup files.  Again, as an example, a DDR3 bank is not a trivial piece of hardware to design, layout, interface and configure.<p>None of this is to say that it is impossible for a non-EE to learn and become quite capable at developing with FPGA&#x27;s.  however, this isn&#x27;t just like learning a new programming language.  I&#x27;ll venture a guess that most programmers would have trouble committing to going down the deep and twisted rabbit hole they&#x27;d have to navigate.  Again, not impossible.  Seen it done.  But it isn&#x27;t software and it requires serious dedication.",1371530882

Mega-man is freaking hard, pixel level mess ups.  I played Mega man 9 with throwback sprite single buffer flicker and difficulty, it wasn&#x27;t as fun.<p>Plus all this was pre-internet and pre-mobile with much less entertainment vying for our attention.  Games should be fun, usually that means simple to get started, but deeper and harder to master still needs to be there.<p>I have always thought the mobile appstore type gaming handheld market we have now is closer to the experimentation of the arcades and back then it was all in-app purchasing only tied heavily to progression (via quarters/tokens).  Now it is to deepen the experience and customize it for the most part.  Customization was very minimal then.  I really think this is the best age to be a game developer and game player.  The console markets stopped many great game devs from entering and helping to propel that market, mobile and web gaming has no such limitation to their benefit.",1371530574

Independent of the 5th amendment, prosecutors are generally not allowed to introduce prejudicial evidence, or evidence that would exploit the irrationality of humans more that provide actual evidence. It feels like this type of body language analysis would qualify. Perhaps if there was someone with training in body language, and he could cite research generally accepted by the scientific community, that his method of analysis produces reliable results, then this may be admissible.<p>Of course, they should also maintain a recording of the interview so the defense can use it, and to mitigate the potential for human failures.

The trade-off, however, is that every level of logic adds delay to the path and you can&#x27;t clock your registers any faster than the sum of all the delays allows (with some exceptions).<p>This simple diagram sort of demonstrates the concept:<p><a href=""http://m.eet.com/media/1176731/sync-vs-async-01.gif"" rel=""nofollow"">http://m.eet.com/media/1176731/sync-vs-async-01.gif</a>",1371530420

But for whatever reason, in Firefox 21.0 on my Mac OS 10.7.5 (MacBook Air), every page on their site takes several seconds to load. It always felt like a bug and no other browser on my computer has this slowness. So I did a little digging and some binary-search-like process of elimination to find the culprit.<p>The problem is in this CSS resource:<p>http://dnqgz544uhbo8.cloudfront.net/_/fp/css/main-base.f4gmHr37dkTU585y-PwfDg.css<p>Specifically this line:<p><pre><code>  .wf-loading .post-header .post-title,.wf-loading .post-field.subtitle,.wf-loading .post-field.body,.wf-loading .post-meta,.wf-loading .post-author-card,.wf-loading .post-article .caption{visibility:hidden}
</code></pre>
And specifically this part of that line:<p><pre><code>  .wf-loading .post-field.body,
</code></pre>
I verified this by downloading their only two CSS resources locally and along with an HTML page from their site. I edited the HTML to point to my local CSS from their CDN and could reproduce the slowness every time (loading from my local SSD!). When I remove &quot;.wf-loading .post-field.body,&quot; from the above-mentioned CSS, the page loads instantly.<p>I figure I could dig some more to see how that CSS class is being used any why it&#x27;s being used. But I figure this is a good task for someone at Medium.com ... of course this may be a Mozilla bug. And the real defect may be in something that&#x27;s slow prior to changing visibility from hidden.

Let me input my two cents:<p>I was trained to do this. From day one of dedicated 8-hour training sessions, we&#x27;re trained to find customers the right &quot;solution&quot; rather than get the most money. This requires using the APPLE technique (acronym, google it). The second P stands for &quot;Present a solution for the customer to take home today.&quot; It was common knowledge at the time (4 years ago) that consumers were brainwashed to thinking faster/more is always better. But when we can save them hundreds of dollars, this isn&#x27;t the case. There were many many times I talked someone out of a $2,000 MacBook Pro for a $1200 entry-level iMac with double the specs because after probing (the first &quot;P&quot;) I learned they didn&#x27;t need to be mobile. This was really, really common.<p>And note, this isn&#x27;t about trying to convince people to spend less. Sometimes after probing, we learned they needed _more_. It is about the RIGHT solution.<p>To add to this: specialists don&#x27;t earn commission. We weren&#x27;t ranked based on financial sales numbers (there are other metrics, however). There is no incentive for specialists to sell more expensive or less expensive things. It is about the right thing.<p>So, this guy was just doing what he was trained to do. It is Apple store standard.",1371528008

China is also capitalist because it uses most capitalist tenets (things sort of mingle where politics and economics meet).<p>On the other hand the old Soviet Union was a communist political system with a command-economy. The state decided what was built, where you worked, and how much you earned.<p>China hasn't been a true marxist-communist since the late 70s.

930738,comment,930148,930148,0,0,ahlatimer,,,"""...the communist state's..."" - FTA<p>Why is China still referred to as a communist state? In fact, why is ""communist state"" even in our vernacular? It's an oxymoron. In a communist system, there is no state as everything is owned by everyone. There is no central authority; the authority is left up to the proles. The fact that people need to find employment and actually buy things, and the fact that there is still difference in comfort of living, shows that China is, in fact, not at all communist. The fact they aren't even working towards a classless system, shows that they aren't communist, even taking a loose definition of the term.<p>Edited for clarity.

Or you sometimes wear a “design hat” in addition to your other roles at your company?  Because if you were spending 40 hours a week on design work, buying and learning and using Photoshop instead of the GIMP would pay for itself quite quickly.<p>I should have been clearer.  I'm sure <i>there exist</i> people who use the GIMP, even though I don’t know them. I do not, however, think the GIMP provides “considerable competition” in the image editing space by any reasonable definition of “considerable”.  I don’t have any solid numbers of my own, and really have no idea how I’d look for any, but if we just judge by, for instance, relative numbers of books offered for sale about each product, Photoshop has a simply crushing market-share advantage.<p>> <i>quality demands seem so low in the print media industry</i><p>I don’t work in print media (I’m a political science student), but this seems like a pretty cheap shot. One could take similar shots at programmers, musicians, scientists, etc.",1257765674

930726,comment,930646,930646,0,0,ramchip,,,"Monads can be useful as an abstraction; it's more than just a somewhat convoluted way to do I/O. Look at a parser written with Parsec, or the JIT code generation that Harpy offers with monads and combinators. It's very concise and readable. I also think a major strong point of Haskell that you omitted is the type system. I've never had so few runtime errors. Which might not be saying much, since I usually program in C++ ;) but after, I admit it, a fair time spent fighting with the compiler, my experience is that when I finally get it to compile the code is correct. The purity also allows for some clever optimizations; with native code generation, Haskell is very fast. Especially if you include the JVM start time, it feels much snappier than Clojure/Java.",1257765310

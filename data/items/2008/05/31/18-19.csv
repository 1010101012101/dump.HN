The documentation on how you should apply to join sounds more buraucratic then it feels in reality. So if you use it and fix things for yourself locally, then consider joining as well by all means, we can only all benefit from it mutually.<p>As somebody working with code all the time, I like MP's approach of compiling yourself, possibly patching memory profiling into your ruby, or whatever you might need.",1212260347

It will be very hard to do the same with an english site, especially if you consider that few italian people are comfortable using a site written in english so we somewhat will lost the users that are more available to us.",1212260022

At the time, probably C++ or Perl. Yet he used his knowledge of Lisp to gain a competitive advantage for his company, and it ended up making him rich. C++ and Perl may have helped him too, but that's actually less likely, since they wouldn't have given his company its competitive advantage of nimbleness and rapid changes.<p>You can't know in advance what will be worth learning. Except, you can: if you want to learn it, if you have a desire to understand how it works, and if that desire is storng enough to spur you to learning it, it's worth learning.<p>I'd add an extra indicator actually: if everyone tells you it's worth learning, chances are it's not. If everyone tells you it's a waste of time, chances are it's worth learning. Why? Because people in aggregate will point you towards popular options (duh) - and those will probably give you less of an edge. This makes the OP's question even less valid.",1212259776

Another way to see obtain a partition of G is to observe that the relation x ~ y if and only if x = y or x = y^{-1} is an equivalence relation on G. The equivalence classes induce the partition above. The point is that any two equivalence classes {x, x^{-1}},{y,y^{-1}} are either disjoint or equal, and their union is G.

I've found that writing a library rarely affects how quickly I get something done -- solving a general problem and a specific instance of a general problem usually involve the same amount of thinking (and a bit more code).  Thinking is slow, and typing is fast... so I wouldn't worry about this being a time sink.<p>Plus, when you release the library, the other people that happen to use it will start fixing it for you.  Now you have people working on your specific problem <i>for free</i>.<p>Anyway, once you get a culture of library building going, the net result is a huge time savings for everyone in the community.",1212258288

NASA is doing great things with little funding it has, so let's not forget how <i>expensive</i> space travel/exploration/intra-sol magic really is.  The agency is pretty much controlled in what it does by government directives, how can we blame them for not being able to pursue every space plan?<p>Plus this article sure does a number on statistical fallacies, 'Even if space strikes are likely only once every million years, that doesn’t mean a million years will pass before the next impact—the sky could suddenly darken tomorrow'<p>Yeah, great, fear-mongering space object impacts.

205332,comment,205258,205258,0,0,BrandonM,,,"I can see where the author is coming from with Point 3 (Don't build a framework or library). In fact, I personally suffered from the problem of spending time on a framework when I really should have just been building the application, but that was partly because it wasn't my application and the framework was more interesting. But that's a different story....<p>So I do agree that rolling your own framework right from the start is probably a bad idea, but I wouldn't say the same for a library. A library is much-smaller-scale than a framework. In general, a well-built module in your program can likely be converted to a more general-purpose library with just one small iteration (in my experience at least). This should be especially true if you only generalize the functionality that you're currently using and avoid adding every function/method that you will ever possibly need.<p>The benefit of building a library is that once you do, you can consider that part finished for a long time. You can build a little test that checks the library's edge cases while also serving as a good example of how to use your library (it's always good to have simple code to refer to in 6 months). And if the library isn't too proprietary, you can throw it up on a public-facing server, where you can both help others and have a decent chance of receiving good feedback (if not patches) for better algorithms, bugfixes, or additional helpful functionality that others have implemented.<p>Specifically if you're working in a language that you will use for the majority of your projects, having a collection of personal libraries is invaluable. You will have this wonderful repository of functionality that you're already intimately familiar with, and instead of having that nagging feeling that you're re-coding something that you've done in the past, you will be able to go back and use a solid piece of tested code with very little effort expended on (re-)learning an API.",1212257595

I also get the feeling that the team is very slow on MacPorts.<p>Fink uses a dpkg/apt-like system, which means binaries are pre-compiled for you.  So you lose in flexibility (which is why I feel ports has a better design), but I suspect (having not used it in a while nor for long) that the team is better.<p>There's also Gentoo Prefix which has ported Gentoo's Portage over to other OSes, including OS X.  They're pretty good, but lacking in package selection.  I ported over at least a dozen packages in the 2-3 weeks I used them (it's 1-3 commands in 85% of the cases).",1212257525

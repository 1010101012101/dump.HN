(All you fellow old farts: How many prove-able, truly, completely superior alternatives were there to DOS in the old days?).  And hasn't Windows, since the 1.0 release, always been inferior to the Mac?  Has it not always crashed more, required more re-installs, and basically been a technical let-down in one way or another?  This guy acts like he just discovered that Windows is technically inferior to the alternatives.  This guy's standing so close to the curve, he thinks it's a flat line.<p>I'm thinking, as comatose_kid states, maybe this guy's not old enough.

249113,comment,248623,248623,0,0,pauljonas,,,"NetNewsWire<p>Have embarked upon a quest to break it — up to ~1000 feeds, and although it stalls out my MBP during huge updates, it's held up very well. Tried Google Reader but at about ~200 feeds, it crapped out and the whole AJAXy UI became totally unmanageable (plus, frequent bouts where the server never returned) — Google Reader issues may have been rectified, but at time I experimented with it, it was unwieldy.<p>I need to do some housekeeping to NNW — presently, I sort by feed source, and just fly through/ignore about half the feeds (especially the ones with frequent updates). It seems the more frequent the update, the less the quality fare, though HN is an exception in this regard. Really need to set up  folder buckets to bury those that I might want to read, given extra time.<p>I scan and can flip through titles and first few paragraphs rapidly (3 pane view).<p>It really is a more efficient reading experience that magnifies your news/blog coverage, but you need to refine, and dispense with the ones that don't add value or at least bury them.<p>There is a dichotomy in reading experience via RSS vs. the Web that I will write an article about at some future point and lay out all my thoughts — lots of good stuff out there that has no RSS or content that RSS is not sufficiently capturing the content (some titles only or less than a sentence in body, or web site styling that enhances the viewership experience).<p>OTOH, the big benefit of RSS is getting to read without the extraneous, tarted up graphic fare in a font size/style more suited to reading text on a monitor.",1216329885

Those are very poor solutions!<p>#1 and #2 cause strong negative backlash. As you would learn from marketing theory, a user that you have personally screwed with will likely cause 20x more damage to your brand than your best users improve it. #3 Locks out a lot of useful expertise. For sure, HN could use a lot more knowledge about programming. So far, this site has attracted lots of people who want to learn but much less so people who already know a lot and have wide experience. We still very much need to be inviting to the latter.<p>Another point that very knowledgeable people are very opinionated, stubborn, and generally assholes. Linus Torvalds is the stereotypical example. This is not to excusing the behavior, but the correlation exists and we will all have to try not to get so offended and ban people like immature children.<p>If you try to hold onto the past forever instead of trying to improve then you will fail.<p>I hope this was useful.",1216329871

I'm currently subscribed to approximately 30 feeds, and I tend to skim the headlines on the busier sites, and then read whatever might catch my eye.  On the slower sites, or blogs from folks that I know, I tend to read the whole article, or give up after I decide that I'm just not interested.
I have it configured to purge already read posts, so I just page down the busier blogs until I finish, or stumble upon something I like.  I also tend to use the mark all read after the weekend or a day or two off, since I don't have the time to sift through too much detritus from not servicing my feeds.  I think with news/social news sites like reddit & slashdot, which I had subscribed to, and subsequently unsubscribed to, have too much noise to lend themselves to reading in an RSS feed.",1216329434

It seemed that the computer medium was dross and doldrum.<p>Previously, in HS, I was terribly bored with most subject matter presentation and irritated by authority in general.<p>I had been an avid reader since 5 or 6 and had read science fiction/fantasy and classic literature during these formative years. I did not do well in the college environment. I dropped all my classes.<p>Years later, I returned to college: emphasis had once again turned to the printed word, symbolism, and other recognizable concepts rather than any ability to use a computer. 4.0 average for two semesters was the result.<p>At the third semester I found myself in honors courses which irritated me with opinions I was too immature to discard gracefully and once again dropped out.<p>Provided as counterpoint to this article.",1216329337

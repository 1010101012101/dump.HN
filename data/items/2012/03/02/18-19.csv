The original article claims, in essence, that war creates an environment where ordinary people can kill without it affecting them much personally. That is, from a behavioral point of view, what psychopaths do in regular society.<p>The article definitely isn't claiming that the 5% of so of humanity that is genetically incapable of feeling (much) empathy (i.e. sociopaths) make up 80% of the military corpus. The math obviously doesn't work out.<p>The article claims that war changes people. Some end up with PTSD, other people cope in another other way that makes them look like psychopaths.",1330714760

3657818,comment,3657026,3657711,31,0,spindritf,,,"> War is part of society? To barbaric ones maybe. Civilized societies don't settle disputes by mass murder.<p>It's quite the opposite -- only civilized societies can have the kind of logistics, range, military culture, ability to support the warrior class (or standing armies), and numbers to engage in organized warfare. Conflicts between small bands of foragers can hardly be even called war.<p>Not to mention mass murder which absolutely requires the kind of discipline, organization and leadership only a very cohesive and civilized society can provide. It just doesn't happen outside of civilization, no one has the means, or could benefit from it. Anything of the scale of holocaust is only possible in a highly industrialized country.<p>> So now poor kids with few options are recruited into the military. Problem solved.<p>Actually, poor kids seem to be enlisting at lower rates (relatively) to richer kids:<p>> Enlisted recruits in 2006 and 2007 came primarily from middle-class and upper-middle-class backgrounds.

A knife, you are probably going to get cut but your attacker will fair far worse. A gun becomes less useful the closer an attacker is, during something like a mugging, they are typically very close.<p>But, even when learning how to deal with an attacker with a knife or gun, any decent instructor will tell you the best response is just to give them what they want and get out of there.

If they rush the MMA fighter with a broken bottle, they'd get slammed to the floor on their own velocity and the MMA fighter would twist around, take their back, grab and arm, get their legs around it pull. Good luck fighting with a broken arm.<p>We saw it play out recently. Remember Kimbo Slice? If you don't, he used to post videos of him beating the crap out of regular dudes in street fights for money. He became a legend. People were saying he was unstoppable. He went to the UFC based on that and lost just about every major match he was in. Why? Because he doesn't train for the various martial arts the way even the lowliest fighter does there. He's currently in boxing, now, and likely will be back fighting normal people in the street for 500 bucks again.<p>Seriously, you think guys who train 8 hours a day in Muay Thai and Jiu Jitsu aren't going to be good at beating you up? You think some street thug would rough up Junior Dos Santos or Anderson Silva? They would KILL the common man, likely in short order. A broken glass would just make them more careful about it (and piss them off even more).<p>This isn't even to say if Silva grabbed a glass, too. Then what?",1330714393

3657790,comment,3657026,3657623,20,0,tfb,,,"There are some logical flaws with the sociopath label, but there is certainly some truth to it, at least from my own experience.  I'll provide a single example.<p>One of my childhood bullies - let's call him Tom - is most definitely a sociopath, and he joined the marines, along with his two brothers who are not unlike him.  All three of these guys have been violent for as long as I've known them.  During middle school and high school (and the couple years after where he happened to live in the same city as my university), he would pick fights with anyone and everyone for the dumbest reasons.  I think he did it just to do it.  Oddly enough, despite all the bullying and ""shittalk"" towards me over the years, he never fought me - although we did come close a couple of times but I just laughed at his stupidity and that was that.  One of the last ""conversations"" I had with Tom was shortly before he went off to boot camp (or whatever you want to call it) and I asked him why he was going; he explained that he had nothing else better to do <i>so he might as well go kill some people</i>.  He said those exact words, and he was dead serious.<p>If you're wondering why I didn't avoid the guy like the plague, it's because he and I had a lot of the same friends and he would always throw parties as his house to which my friends would invite me.  Despite Tom's overly violent behavior, he was always very popular with the ladies, and most people really liked him.  This is the same guy who posts pictures of himself on facebook cutting off the heads of goats in his marine gear.  My theory is that because of his aggressive behavior (and using it to ""dominate"" others), people perceived him as an alpha male.  Can I get a second opinion on this?  Because so many people liking such a violent sociopath has always bothered and confused me.<p>Back on topic though... while Tom and his brothers are an example of <i>some</i> confirmation of the article's statements, as far as marines (or army, navy, etc.) go, for every Tom I've known, I've also known at least a few very easy-going men.  So the author is partially right but his argument is flawed.  Violent sociopaths without education probably do gravitate towards the military and war, but the statistics have got to be way off - not nearly 80% - but that's just from the small sample set of my experiences.",1330714321

While we don't have time to check everyone's code, it seems like the majority of problems fall into one of a few cases.<p>1.    Students deleted or modified the code above the comment section. This section was necessary for grading purposes. Admittedly this is not the most robust system and we will try our best to make future homework more clear about what you can modify.<p>2.    Students redefined the show() function. While this wasn't explicitly forbidden, this had the same affect on the grading as modifying the show command. The reason you couldn't do this is because we actually redefine the show command in our grading script. This was an effort to prevent us from grading you wrong if your solution included print statements for debugging.<p>3.    Students did not make their solution general enough. These solutions tended to only work for a world of 20 cells. We tested with a variety of worlds, so such a solution would not have been marked as correct.<p>We apologize for the confusion and the effect this had on some of your grades for the first hw. I hope everyone still enjoyed the homework, we put a lot of work into making it and we are as disappointed as you when it doesn't turn out perfectly.<p>Please mark this solution as correct so other students can see the ""official"" answer. Thanks!<p>---<p>k_l_s:<p>I guess I'm not sure what to make of this answer. While I understand that you have what seems to be thousands of users and so individual attention would be inplausible, you are presenting a rating system through which you are communicating to folks (admittedly, I am one of them) that their material mastery is poor when it likely is not. It would seem to me that the solution is to fix the grading system or to do away with grades, if it is technologically infeasible to correctly evaluate an individual's mastery of the material. Simply explaining that the grading technology is lacking but leaving the grades in place is demotivating and, quite honestly, perplexing. We students don't know the full implication of these grades, but almost certainly they will remain in your database and might even have significance, in the future, that would make some of us regret simply ignoring them. I presume that I am not the only one who would like to see the system work.<p>---",1330713986

3657699,comment,3656522,3656522,8,0,microarchitect,,,"DARPA and others are concernced about this exact scenario and are funding research into reverse-engineering chips to detect these types of backdoors. There are two parts this problem. One part is using electron microscopes and lasers and whatnot to go from silicon to a netlist of gates. The second part, which I'm a little more familiar with, is ""decompiling"" these gates into higher-level structures like ALUs and multipliers. The hope is that we can identify maybe 80% of the circuit to be good/recognized  using purely algorithmic techniques and then a human can dig in and look through the remaining 20% for anything suspicious.<p>They do seem to be more concerned about chips the US buys from certain other countries than about the likes Intel/AMD building in backdoors.<p>EDIT: I should also mention that this is not just a concern of the american defence. I'm aware of the indian govt also funding this sort of research with similar motivation. However, in this instance, the professor was trying to attack the problem through the lens of formal techniques. I think the idea was to prove that if the chip interacts with the outside world through these limited set of channels then you can't sneak data out through some sort of covert channel hiding in the ""regular"" communication. The specific concern here was about routers/switches and the like equipment sneaking sensitive data out of a secure network.",1330713102

Speaking purely from my own experience and my knowledge of two of my coworkers, money is always a factor, but once you get past enough to live comfortably, other factors start to come into play.  I don't want a larger house (I'd like to pay it off, instead), I know I probably have a raise coming soon and I don't care how much it is for.  About 5 years ago I cut my salary off at $60,000 before taxes.  I get paid much more than that, but that's all I see in my main checking account and I'll probably drop that to $40,000 soon (a story for another post, perhaps).  My closest coworkers (the ones who are the top performers IMO) feel the same way.  The environment is good, the work is fun, the money is enough even though we could all do better elsewhere.<p>I've been given other offers, some that were very attractive and paid more.  I've not accepted them because they tended to be too narrow in what I'd be doing.  My job as a corporate drone writing software is <i>fun</i> and rewarding well beyond my salary, I have a great boss and great coworkers and I'd quit and head someplace else for $50,000 if that changed.  Maybe I'm not a typical HN reader in that I have no desire to create a start-up (the business side of it is no fun) or work for one (there's no such thing as job security, but it's admittedly worse and while I'm no stranger to ""crunch time"", my desk will never have a sleeping bag under it).<p><i>I'd spend most of my days skiing</i><p>Are you sure about that?  My dad's life plan was to retire at 35, and he did.  His thing was golf, not skiing, and he did a lot of it for half a year before he took his family's retirement savings and purchased a quarter of a small business where he also took a job as the only salesperson.  ""You can only play so much golf"" is the excuse he gave.  I don't know his net worth, but he has two homes and one is on a lake that is exceptionally prime real estate.  He's past his 60s and still working and I give him another 5 years before he tries to retire again.",1330712948

Innovation, such as portable radios, radios in your car, etc. push the industry forwards for a while.<p>Eventually though, innovation stops (I don't see many new radio sets today).

The internet, arguably, appeals to the same senses, but allows for user-created content, more freedom, etc.<p>When we reach the upper bound of innovation for television sets, it too will become a commodity. Perhaps it will eventually be replaced with a product that not only exceeds the capabilities of human sound and sight (for television to hit the bound for innovation, this must happen), but also incorporates something else: maybe it's another sense, maybe it's something more convenient (I guess the internet, could, to some extent, be considered as an evolution of television).",1330712941

War is a part of society. If society tells you to go kill somebody and you do, you can't be a sociopath.<p>Having said that, it's a great first-person account of what real combat is like, at least for this one guy. I am concerned the effect on HN discussion will be negative. Hopefully I'm wrong.<p>The United States made a huge mistake in moving to an all-volunteer army in the 1970s. With a draft and mandatory conscription, <i>everybody</i> had the common experience of serving and perhaps doing really bad things in the line of duty. As it is now, the vast majority of civilians have absolutely no idea what military service is like, as the author points out.<p>In this lack of context everybody becomes really impressionable. Not only can the military manipulate public opinion through selective release of information, other soldiers like this one can also. When the majority of people don't have context, they'll believe anything.<p>This is why you couldn't get away with writing a really negative article about WWII right after the war. It wasn't that somehow the war wasn't terribly horrible, it was that the average Joe reading it would immediately say something like ""yeah, but that's not the way it was for most people"" or ""you think that's bad? I remember when...""<p>We don't have that kind of audience now. Once again, as the author points out, most of the readers only know cartoon violence and have never even hunted an animal. So people are left substituting other experiences and trying to draw rough analogies. The one thing I know for sure is that different people in different units can have vastly different impressions of a conflict. In my mind, this article would have been better with less ""I'm the sane one and the other soldiers are crazy"" and more ""Here's another view""<p>I would also note that it has become fashionable for authors to say they have all sorts of combat experience when they don't. I'm sure this author isn't one of those people, but I've learned over time to be suspicious of people who wear the grisly warrior mantle as a way to get around my critical thinking skills.

Frankly, you've done a better job of explaining and defending dedicated media types than anything else I've seen and I appreciate you taking the time to engage my comments with seriousness rather than condescension.<p>> Is RSS difficult and complicated to learn and use?<p>No, but RSS is a schema with a specific, narrowly defined purpose: to syndicate article-based web pages (and even so, there are 5 or 6 different versions, not including Atom - though your point stands and I don't want to get sidetracked over a quibble).<p>A more apt comparator may be WSDL, which theoretically allows a SOAP web service's remote procedure calls to be discovered programmatically but in practice is such a messy, complicated, leaky abstraction that it's often easier just to build XML templates manually and POST them to the endpoint.<p>I'd be happy to use and support some kind of lightweight schema for JSON that puts URLs in predictable places in the response object and still allows flexibility to provide the functionality a given service needs. I'm not aware of anything that fits this description, but I'm certainly open to it if you have any recommendations.<p>> You asked why, I ask why not?<p>The model of HTTP resources and methods is useful: it unambiguously delivers real, tangible benefits to the developer and the client over ad-hoc protocols riding on top of HTTP like `GET /create_user.php`.<p>Similarly, it makes sense to use the HTTP status codes we already have instead of reinventing your own arbitrary set of status codes and, e.g. sticking them somewhere in the response body. If someone e.g. does a POST request on /users/1337 to create a user, it makes sense to return a 405 status. (However, I tend to put status codes in the response headers <i>and</i> the response body, just to make it easier for clients to notice what's going on.)<p>It also makes sense to put URLs inside the response body in an obvious way so that the client can ""click through"" to subsidiary resources in a manner analogous to how web pages do it. Again, it makes the web service more or less self-documenting to the client, especially if it uses URLs and HTTP Methods in a sane, predictable way.<p>I'm struggling to understand the benefit of a custom media type beyond merely satisfying one of Roy Fielding's constraints. If the only reason to use a custom media type is to satisfy a constraint,  the constraint might be more ceremonial than useful.<p>If two web services are identical except one serves `Content-Type: application/vnd.some-arbitrary-format+json` and the other serves `Content-Type: application/json`, I get suspicious about the benefits of REST when people say the latter is <i>doing it wrong</i> and doesn't deserve to be called RESTful.",1330711959

Glorification of violence is everywhere in our culture and fiction; I'd imagine at least 95% of gamers understand intuitively that the games they play bear very slight likeness at best to the reality of war (although probably more in the sense that they might be killed themselves rather than that they might kill others.)<p>After all, one of the things (multiplayer) video games <i>do</i> teach you is that combat is <i>seriously dangerous</i>. Pop out of cover for one second and you can get shot in the head, bam, you're dead. In a game, that means respawning; nobody seriously believes that's how it works in real life. In that sense, I have to think that these games, as unrealistic as they are, are still the most realistic fictional depiction of war you can experience-- and the lessons you learn are much more valuable than those of, say, comic books.<p>Which is not to say that we don't have a bit of a violence problem in our culture (though I'm on the side of Steven Pinker in thinking that our violence problem is probably better than it ever has been). But the problem is not the kids running around playing cops and robbers. The problem is the kids who never properly learn the distinction between playing and hitting-- and worst of all, those who learn it by the maxim that ""If you hit your brother, I'll hit you even harder.""<p>That's what we should be talking about.",1330711693

One I've thought about in a different context before: How much bandwidth/resolution do we really need.<p>The human senses have an upper limit of resolution, once we reach that limit further progress is irrelevant. So once everyone is streaming netflix at limitx2, Where does further bandwidth/storage demand come from? Growing populations? There's a limit to that growth. ""big data""? Hardly.<p>We're rapidly approaching the point where individuals' need for further storage is exhausted. I think it'll be somewhere in the 10-100PB range. Which is pretty damn close.",1330711530

3657566,comment,3657343,3657539,2,0,devongovett,,,"Right. I'm not saying it's perfect, just that it's an option worth exploring.  HTML and CSS simply weren't designed for applications.  They're great for documents, but it turns out that using them for this style of application ends up causing a lot of trouble later on as the applications get more complex.  Abstractions can help with this, and once it is abstracted, it shouldn't really matter what the rendering backend is.  Could be DOM or canvas in the browser, and as this project is showing, various native backends as well.  I think that's really powerful.",1330711228

There is always ""speculation"" anytime there is an opportunity to buy something that one thinks can be resold at a profit.  The real estate bubble, by inflating the prices of homes, increased the opportunities for successful speculation.  The main cause of the bubble was cheap mortgages which allowed the price inflation to get so out of control.  The speculation  was a result of the problems, not their cause.  And most real estate speculators were hammered worse than anyone else, except their creditors, when the bubble burst - always a risk with speculation.",1284702415

I am glad to see you're happy, but am most curious what else you think can be improved. How can I help you get to the 100% happiness point? Please feel free to drop a comment in here or email with any feedback you have. For technical bugs, the established process is to indeed go via Connect, so this would NOT replace the correct/official feedback process ... But I promise to read up every comment left as a response to this one and try to follow up on as many of them as are actionable. I am obviously under NDA so cannot always discuss the internals/specifics of what we are doing, nor am I officially a spokesperson for Microsoft, so please keep those in mind when reading my responses :-)",1284700374

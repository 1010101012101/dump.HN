7738151,comment,7737364,7737939,3,0,mercer,,,"In my experience working with designers, and having done a decent amount of design-y work: yes, definitely.<p>In my experience, designers tend to be more holistic in their view on things, to a point where they might outright hate it when things are picked apart and defined and categorized. Which is exactly what engineers excel at.<p>I also find designers to generally be more... emotional, or at least they show their emotional side more, or allow it to express itself.<p>And then there&#x27;s the strong value they place on the &#x27;design&#x27; of things. The feeling, the cohesion, etc.<p>One of the best examples of the difference I can think of is when I showed worrydream.com to a designer friend. I was excited about Brett Victor&#x27;s talks, his views on programming and interfaces and whatnot, and figured my friend would be at least interested in the UX stuff. This friend, however, hated how the site felt bloated and slow and how that in itself was pretty much enough for him to not take this guy&#x27;s articles seriously. It was an affront, and surely anyone who had anything interesting to say on design and UI would take care of his own site!<p>Now in many cases the difference between designers and engineers might not be so pronounced. I suppose it&#x27;s a spectrum. But I notice very clear differences between developers and designers, and it seems to be a common cause of conflict.<p>I&#x27;ve also noticed this difference within myself. For the past two years I mostly focused on development, after a long time of taking care of more of the whole pipeline (especially client contact and the &#x27;social&#x27; aspects of design). I noticed that I started caring markedly less and less about the end result&#x27;s &#x27;beauty&#x27; or logic, and more and more on the internals. I actually stopped noticing things that would&#x27;ve bothered me tremendously in the past: fonts, padding, margins, UX, and so on.<p>In part, maybe it&#x27;s also a role you step into (where either role somehow excludes the other).<p>And the mere fact that I come across <i>very</i> few people who seem to be both excellent designers <i>and</i> engineers supports the idea that there&#x27;s a difference.",1399989509
7738150,comment,7736702,7737927,1,0,estrabd,,,"This was my take away question. Redis can be used extremely effectively as a pool of job queues with failover.  Perhaps RabbitMQ provides robust bidirectional messaging? While pooling Redis works well for one-way job submission (with each Redis instance being backed by some set of work consumers), making the process synchronous (whereby the consuming worker communicates back to the producer) is not so clearly handled in a robust way unless the producer is listening on some set of Redis instances for the single reply message.  RabbitMQ seems heavy weight just to solve that single problem, though.",1399989474

7738139,comment,7731996,7731996,1,0,thisisdallas,,,"As a front-end dev I am actually a big fan of Windows 8. I used OS X for a couple of years and finally realized I was placing too much emphasis on flashy GUIs and I had a different program for every little task.<p>Around the time Windows 8 came out I built a new pc and started using Win8 as my main OS. Now, my workflow basically consists of git, sublime, Photoshop/Illustrator, and gulp. I do use putty/rdp for server admin related tasks and filezilla for any ftp needs. I am pretty obsessive about having a clean OS, knowing exactly where my files are, and having as much customization as I need/want and I feel like Windows does that better for me than OS X. I also just prefer the design of Win8 to OS X.<p>Here is the kicker, most of things I prefer about Windows can be accomplished on OS X, it&#x27;s just a personal preference. In general, I don&#x27;t think Windows 8 is necessarily better than OS X for everyone but for me it is better. Find the OS you like, find the tools that you are most productive with, and build great products :)",1399989349

Memory I/O is a classic example - it has sped up <i>a lot</i> but only if you make sure that you aren&#x27;t generating cache misses on every memory access. Branch-prediction-friendly code is another good example that can make a huge difference to the performance of a system.<p>That means that a lot of the performance gains that we have achieved (not all, certainly, but a substantial chunk) are not necessarily made available to naively-written code. It is not terribly surprising then that we sometimes struggle to achieve the speed-ups the hardware has made available to us.<p>This problem is only compounded by the fact that performance is one of the leakiest things going when we are talking about abstraction layers.  It makes things extremely difficult to think about because you need to  know intimate detail of your entire software stack, which these days is huge, if you wish to effectively optimize your code.",1399987439

The black education system was horrific, and designed to create a permanent underclass. The white education system, while far better, emphasised conformism, rather than innovation. Still it produced Elon Musk, so it couldn&#x27;t have been that bad. Today, limited resources, poor planning, and stupid teachers (protected by a powerful union) have led to our near-bottom position in world rankings.<p>It was recently revealed that the dominant teachers&#x27; union has been selling posts in some provinces (in black schools). Bizzarely, parents in School Governing Bodies, who would presumably be expected to look after their childrens&#x27; interests, were in on this scam. The rest of Africa seems to have less dysfunctional education systems.<p>A more sensitive point is that South Africa also has a small middle class (largely white), with a huge amount of wealth, but diminishing brain power due to emigration. Their self-preservation instincts mean that development is often stifled because of their needs. Want to build a high-density development close to a city centre, or a rapid-transit system? Not near these NIMBYs (they delayed a much-needed Bus Rapid Transit link between central Johannesburg and Sandton for years because it passed their leafy suburbs, it was finally rerouted last year). Want to build a high speed train service, for these same people - one that they have come to love? Their political representatives tried to kill it. Want to improve the freeways funded by electronic tolling to eliminate multi-hour traffic delays? - they try their utmost to sabotage it. Social solidarity is dead, and many are utterly opposed to transformation - many white government school governing bodies have managed to create a situation akin to apartheid, by cheating on admissions, and co-opting a few government officials by allowing their children in. I expect this sort of attitude to backfire quite badly, which is why I am heading for the exits myself.<p>South African business is dominated by monpollists, and the government lacks the skill to rein them in. Our dominant cellphone networks have been ripping consumers off for years, and use the judicial system to stymie remedies.<p>The list goes on.",1399986456

For example, say you have some kind of fundraising event donation system  where you can have a donor donate to people or teams of people participating at the event as well as the event itself or the organization as a whole. So, something like a 5k run to save the whales.<p>When you create a donation that impacts potentially an auth record and a user account (if they create one), a donation, as well a it could end up touching the event, participant, team, or organization itself. Now, do you make all those data changes as a series of nouns with actions that you must do in some particular workflow and order? Or, do you have a higher level verb that you throw input at and it returns a result, doing whatever it needs to do in the process? Or do you have a noun with a single verb that starts to feel a lot like RPC?<p>In some ways they are equivalent, you have input, state change, and output. In other ways they are different. I would expect in REST you might have to hit multiple nouns to change all the state appropriately and I&#x27;m not sure there is a good mechanism to enforce that it happens correctly according to the desired workflow.<p>In the end, for things beyond CRUD and reporting, I think complex actions that touch multiple verbs is often better represented as a verb. However, I would love to see concrete examples of how you model complex workflow based state changes as a &quot;transaction&quot; or workflow in REST or if REST api&#x27;s inherently opt out of such behavior.",1399986357

In other words, the Anglo-American system of common law is a system that has developed by generalizing from particular cases as they come up, and not by thinking from the top down about what kind of rules would be ideal.<p>It&#x27;s rich with deeper meaning that there are a number of comments here about the development of rules and laws as we comment on an article posted on Wikipedia. I am one of thousands of volunteer editors on Wikipedia (since May 2010) years after having been (1) an editor of a glossy monthly bilingual publication about a foreign country as an expatriate resident of that country, (2) an editor of a series of English-language trade magazines about manufactured products from that same country, and (3) a student-editor (usually the only kind of editor such a publication has) of a law review. I started editing Wikipedia as late as I did, years after Wikipedia was founded, because when I first heard about Wikipedia I thought its editorial policies are madness--and, sure enough, the articles that resulted from the original policy included a lot of cruft. As Wikipedia has continued in existence, it has not been able to continue an Ayn Rand anarchy of bullies but has gradually had to develop rules and procedures and (a little bit of) hierarchy and organization. Most of the articles on the topics I do the most of my professional research in are still LOUSY, and I have been interviewed twice by the Wikipedia <i>Signpost</i> in the last several months about what needs to be done to improve articles on Wikipedia for various WikiProjects. The article kindly submitted here illustrates the problem, with its incoherent presentation of facts and speculation from a mixture of good and poor sources.<p>I live among the largest Somali expatriate community in the world outside Somalia (Minneapolis and its suburbs--we can listen to Somali-language local radio here since the 1990s) and have a new client for my supplementary mathematics classes whose family is from Somalia. That country&#x27;s internal conditions during my adult life have been HARSH, and I don&#x27;t envy any Somali patriot&#x27;s task in trying to build up a country with peace, stability, and justice for all Somali citizens.

7618795,comment,7618049,7618049,1,0,EGreg,,,"I have a simple saying: &quot;People live lives. Companies build products.&quot; To me, maintaining a free lifestyle is an important goal, more than money. If the company is building something worthwhile, it will eventually get there. That&#x27;s why I am a big proponent of setting up clear autonomous systems and processes, and placing less blame on people. As long as things get done, I don&#x27;t care who the person dates or where they live. If things aren&#x27;t getting done, then we review what the problem is. Half the time it&#x27;s not the person, but the process.<p>One thing this article gets right: there are tools and there are culture. Tools determine the process, which has an effect on the culture, but the culture develops organically depending on who&#x27;s in the team. If you are super culture heavy, you&#x27;ll hire A+ superstars (like the recent article about building a cult). But as for me, I don&#x27;t want to be a cult leader. I want to build better tools to empower people to help each other and make their own decisions. Both in our company, and in the rest of the world.",1398034757
7618794,comment,7618406,7618609,4,0,betterunix,,,"The problem with proofs is that you need to know <i>what</i> to prove, and that is hard.  Even formalizing something as seemingly simple as <i>sorting</i> is tough for most programmers.  If your formalization of whatever you wanted to implement is wrong, then your proof is worthless -- you have only proved that your program does something other than what it was supposed to do.<p>It&#x27;s not that TDD is perfect, but it is a pragmatic approach to <i>reducing</i> bugs and it helps a lot in preventing regressions.",1398034726
7618792,comment,7618125,7618277,6,0,rst,,,"The main reason he was worried about recovery at that point was that the booster had splashed down into something like 20-foot waves.  That&#x27;s high enough to be real trouble for some of the recovery boats they wanted to have out there (which may be one reason why we haven&#x27;t heard much about how it finally wound up).  And it could also very well sink a rocket stage that wasn&#x27;t built to handle this particular kind of buffeting, and is made to be pretty lightweight.<p>As to longer term plans, it&#x27;s not clear they will relaunch the first booster they get back, even if seawater exposure weren&#x27;t an issue.  More likely, they&#x27;ll disassemble it, and see how the parts handled the stress of a full launch and re-entry, looking for wear that could endanger a second launch of the same booster.  If there are any unpleasant surprises like that lurking, it&#x27;s a lot cheaper to find out this way than in a launch with a payload at risk.",1398034680

7618790,comment,7614575,7616608,1,0,miklevin,,,"&quot;Code for life&quot; is a big part of my philosophy. Over the years, I&#x27;ve found that one of the biggest obstacles was code-loss due to various causes, not the least of which is just losing interest and forgetting where everything is.<p>The only defense against this seems to be the two-fold approach of getting your code into more than one place, and being able to rapidly reproduce your code execution environment. For getting it into more than one place, I take many lines of defense: making Levinux so small that it&#x27;s easy to copy, partitioning the hard drives so that syncing an entire virtual machine over Dropbox is still fast and efficient... and finally, distributed version control.<p>I&#x27;ve found in my work with git and Mercurial, workflow is totally transformed always for the better. And while neither git or vim are technically part of the code execution stack, they are both fundamental to what I&#x27;m trying to teach. I&#x27;m taking some creative license in how I define a stack :-)",1398034663

You have only mentioned that it would be easier and scale but this isn&#x27;t a proper answer. The best way to do this is to create a narrative or story around the product.<p>d) Bear in mind that h1...h6 tags are used for SEO which you don&#x27;t seem to have.

Actually I wouldn&#x27;t even say it. Hardware implementation are also subject to side-channels, even when they include countermeasures. Leakage models we have for hardware are not accurate enough, and maybe they can&#x27;t be. Take for instance with the power consumption side-channel: not every bit in a register leak the same (when being set or reset, they do not consume the same amount of energy / emit the same amount of EM radiation), and the actual leak depends on so many thing that the only way to know it is to measure it in the precise environment of the threat on the actual hardware that may be subject to attack. Actual hardware behavior is so difficult to predict, and side-channel attacks manage to exploit any bias, leak, glitch, anything.<p>Plus, there is still the possibility of fault injection attacks…",1398033968

Maybe this will change in the future, but in the present it&#x27;s generally far more cost-effective to use a statically-typed programming language along with some form of automated testing. That gives many of the benefits of more formal methods of verification, but while also avoiding many of the costs, even if the end result doesn&#x27;t conform to some theoretical idea of &quot;perfection&quot;.",1398033314

7618725,comment,7618049,7618517,4,0,robert_tweed,,,">If the culture of a company is well known, articulated and understood, there&#x27;s a self-selection process that happens. A given culture attracts certain kinds of people -- so it becomes self-reenforcing.<p>That&#x27;s essentially my point about gravitation, except my assertion that it doesn&#x27;t scale. After a certain point, it becomes more important to hire the people the company needs, not just the people that want to work there. Below a certain size it is <i>much</i> easier for those to be overlapping sets.<p>> that doesn&#x27;t mean there can&#x27;t be an overarching culture that is shared organisation wide<p>I think inopinatus is on the right track in terms of breaking &quot;culture&quot; down into different things. There can certainly be certain values and principles of &quot;how things are done&quot; that span the whole company (note: I&#x27;m not saying processes either - perhaps &#x27;ethics&#x27; is the right word). But that&#x27;s not enough to make a culture, and trying to force one out of those relatively small commonalities is where things generally fall down.<p>Again I think the most important thing when it comes to scaling out is having representation in place at various levels and listening to what people at the lower levels actually want, rather than trying to dictate things in a top-down manner. It is very likely that as teams become more specialised, they will have much more individual needs that might not fit with certain aspects of the original culture. There&#x27;s no reason that the shared culture can&#x27;t evolve and stay beneficial to everyone - just expect the size of that shared part to shrink if you are doing it right.<p>The sad fact is that it&#x27;s much easier to get company culture wrong than it is to get it right. I&#x27;m not going to say I have some magical solution to this because I don&#x27;t, but I do wish you the best of luck with HubSpot - and the same to AirBnB of course. Just because something is an ominous sign doesn&#x27;t mean anything is predestined.<p>One thing that I do think is quite important is that the company culture in a small business tends to be the way it is because the management structure is pretty flat, everyone has a set of shared goals and cooperation is easy. That&#x27;s another thing that doesn&#x27;t scale. It&#x27;s very easy to break a company culture with things like poor management structure, skewed employee incentives, etc., which tend to foster a dog-eat-dog culture and company politics that very often do not exist in smaller companies. Personally, were I currently scaling a business to around 800 staff I&#x27;d be worrying most about the management structure and trying to create an environment where cultures can grow organically, while ensuring what remains consistent are the shared values, goals and company vision.<p>I think by focusing too much on the company culture at the top level, it&#x27;s easy to lose sight of the forest for the trees. In macromanagement there&#x27;s only so much you can directly control and culture isn&#x27;t one of those things. That means getting the outcome you want by indirect means, even if it doesn&#x27;t look exactly how you might have pictured it.",1398033135

7618723,comment,7616910,7617709,2,0,wittjeff,,,"I think the main weakness in this business model, which is the same one with condos, is that people don&#x27;t like to think about the really expensive things that they don&#x27;t need to pay for regularly. When you need a new furnace/roof/fence/siding/driveway/etc., it&#x27;s a multiple-$K hit. If you haven&#x27;t budgeted for it (and I think most people don&#x27;t), then the tendency will be to put it off for another year or three.  I would guess the regular maintenance you outline takes care of perhaps only half the larger long-term upkeep problem.  So prompt comprehensive maintenance with a flat monthly rate requires what seem like very high rates and some escrow, and also involves lower margins than it may appear to the customer.  You may also become a magnet for customers who have already accrued a lot of &quot;maintenance debt&quot;.  So maybe you&#x27;d just need a long list of major unpredictable maintenance exclusions?  Would that still be a satisfactory value proposition?",1398033096

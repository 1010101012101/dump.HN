I understand the python runtime is pretty compact. Thus I'd expect there to emerge solutions similar to what is currently done with C# code. Just wrapping the runtime in the app and having the code as resouces in the app bundle that get fed into the runtime when the application launches.",1233140346

If so you would have gained so much valuable experience in programming + project management + finance + HR. With that experience you will easily get a Senior level job in any company. And that is the worst case. If it succeeds the returns will simply be atleast 10 times more than that of a career life.<p>2. Given the market situation do your PHD, perhaps working on algorithms for detect money launder. The idea is by the time you complete your PHD (3 yrs?) the markets would have turned around surely.<p>And if the PHD is not in one of the top 10 universities, ditch the idea and go for the startup.",1233137896

You've got to be associated with this person or that site to be 'cool' and a 'guru' and if you're not you're nothing.  It's getting beyond a joke.<p>Congratulation, you got a mention on TC or HN, or you've been 'dugg' by lots of people.  It doesn't mean your startup or product is actually good or useful you know.  If that is all the marketing you are relying on then you've only got a 50% chance of success.<p>The whole thing even extends to people.  I'm not going to name names but there seems to be some sort of god-worshipping to people just because they write a blog.  Yes, I enjoy reading them, yes I pick up things from people who have done it before, but it doesn't mean they're some sort of superstar ... and I'm not even going to talk about the ""we've just got a new CIO who used to work at Google brigade"" (oh, he worked at Google, he must be a hero).<p>Thanks for reading.",1233137267

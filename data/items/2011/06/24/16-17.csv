It's far better to have a good knowledge of how modern systems work than waste years attempting to build such a system.<p>Similarly, I have no idea why you would build your own programming language. You're very rarely likely to run into a problem with closure conversion in a programming language you wrote, but you might run into a problem with peephole optimization that you would never get to implementing unless you have a PhD in PL.",1308934715

The features that make them distinct become unidentifiable, they only look slightly odd and uneven.<p>I do, however, think that as we are moving to higher PPI screens curly quotes do look better (and, as you can see from my German example, some languages require you to put quotes in places where you cannot put straight quotes). I, for example, really dont think straight quotes look any good in print which is high resolution. In print all the small features of quotes are always clearly identifiable.<p>I actually think that Georgia has nice curly quotes but they do clump up below 12px or so font sizes. I think no font is free of that problem. I still like to use curly quotes, well, just because. I certainly can understand why you wouldnt want to use them at small font sizes on the screen.<p>(There is one exception. I like to use Letter Gothic for my snail mail correspondence. Letter Gothic is a great monospaced typewriter font and to preserve that typewriter vibe I like to use straight quotes.)",1308934386

There were many ""pagan"" festivals around that time, mostly of the form of some sort of thanks giving (thanking their Gods or other forces for allowing them to survive past the shortest days of the year, or congratulating themselves for the same), but until 800-and-something AD the Christians didn't mark the birth of Christ at that time.

An OS still has to run on the thin client, and Microsoft can develop web apps. I'd be very interested to try out Office 365 when it goes live.<p>Cloud based apps don't have to be web apps.

You have cases where people know of NP (but have never done a reduction), and simultaneously know of version control (but have never actually used svn or git). This is really unfortunate because I feel similar majors (like math and EE) probably prepare you better for these fields (math perhaps being a better precursor to real CS and EE giving you great fundamentals for programming/comp engineering). It seems more and more like there needs to be a clearer separation, something like how econ or finance is separate from math, where math majors don't really have to learn excel or financial formulas, and econ/finance majors don't have to learn linear algebra, and both can go pretty deeply into the things they actually care about.<p>The counter argument to this is that we often see computer engineers that lack a basic grasp of the importance of algorithmic complexity and theoretical folks who write terrible code. You have only to read some discussions on ""JS performance"" to see the ridiculous attention paid to making sure variables are local, when in almost all cases user programs are actually being slowed down by O(n^2) algorithms being used. Similarly, a lot of theoretical work takes a long time to make it into the ""real world"" because they are inaccessible to engineers (being written completely ""in math""), and often when they do provide actual sample code for their work its written in a very sloppy way (from a ""code organization"" standpoint). It really would be ideal if you could have a major that covered both of these really well (and I'm sure there exist some that do, I obviously have not gone through every CS/CECS/EECS major in every university).",1308933548

If you have the time and energy to learn how to 'politic' changing the system becomes a question of scale much like if you understand how compilers are built changing GCC becomes a question of scale. New system call interface for an embedded architecture? Pretty straight forward. Changing operator precedence and making integers 37 bits long? A harder thing (still doable, its just code, but the scale is larger because you touch more of the code in the compiler).<p>So to put your comment in 'tech' terms and continuing my gcc analogy, you posit that the goal isn't to change the compiler since that is too hard, rather delete every copy of the source code everywhere and every executable so that folks will have write a new gcc/binutils from scratch.

If other people want certain features, they are welcome to contribute patches.  I want you to know that I agree with this, I've never disagreed with that.<p>I'm arguing on behalf of a simple hypothesis, that Windows users know Windows and do not know Linux/Unix or POSIX.  Moreover, they may not want or may not have the time to learn Linux/Unix or POSIX subsystem.  They do not know nor can take advantage of what a ""free Unix-like environment"" provides. They know what they know.  Cygwin adds a heavy emulation layer into Windows which they do not know.  To be clear, they do know JavaScript and they do understand what running JavaScript on the server means.<p>Is Cygwin a technological achievement in and of itself? Yes, absolutely. Is Wine? Yes, absolutely. Is ability to run node.js or git on Windows through Cygwin? Yes, absolutely. Is that an awesome hack (in the best sense of the word) for people that understand the Cygwin emulation layer? Yes, absolutely.  Is it an achievement for Windows-only developers and users who don't understand -nix idioms or POSIX subsytem? No, it isn't.<p>That's all I'm saying.  <i>I'm not offering a better solution -- I don't have one</i>. I'm just saying that when someone from the -nix side says that something runs on Cygwin that they should respect and empathize with what that means for Windows users operationally.<p>To use an analogy, earlier a youtube video was posted about a first encounter between a tribe in Papua New Guinea and some white travelers.  The white people had amazing tools are artifacts -- mirrors, matches, plastic cups, knives, etc -- which the tribal peoples had never seen before nor had a framework of understanding within which to reason about them.  Are the tools cool? Yes -- the knife whittled wood far more effectively than their crude tools.  Are the tools scary and hard to understand? Yes -- the tribesman covered the mirror with a leaf (!) because he couldn't understand how it worked or if it was (presumably) some sort of magic.  The *nix command-line/file-system/permissions apparatus is incomprehensible magic voodoo to someone who's only had Windows console experience their entire life.  So for the ""white man"" to say ""but it runs in Cygwin"" to the primitive native peoples is perhaps a tad presumptive.  That's not to say that the native peoples are lesser beings intellectually viz. ""don't eat that poisonous flower"", Windows has had IOCP since NT4.<p>I think it's a wonderful example of the way the process should work that Microsoft is stepping up to help Ryan/Joyent port node.js to idiomatic Windows.",1308932956

That might've been viable Way Back When; now, I doubt it. There's just too much changing at too many levels. What about if the user combines this service pack with these security fixes but not that one, this particular browser release, running over a remote link with either a 3G modem or a home firewall and a particular model of router?<p>Bugs happen, both in the platform and in the app. I've had my code suddenly fail due to a new version before, too. Once, in ten years, and a dev team of two had a fix up and running in a few hours.<p>What's the cost to the business to run all this checking? What's the cost to the business to be running older, less secure, less featureful versions of the software?<p>What would be the cost of the likely scale of failure if they were broken by a new release (factoring in the very, very low likelihood of that happening)? What would be the business interruption cost of having the app down? What would be the opportunity cost of having to pull developers off their other projects and push them quickly onto fixing this internal app?<p>If it's an internal app, you've likely got a small enough, contained enough userbase that it's manageable for you to have a short period of downtime occasionally - I've never known such a service that didn't, frankly. If it's a public app, good luck to you trying to tell your customers they can't use this new version. If it's a third-party app, that's their problem.

2692702,comment,2687885,2692477,1,0,dpark,,,"For the process efficiency, I simply disagree with your assessment.  I'm not aware of any unbiased works that indicate that using a heavyweight process results in even slightly higher quality without significantly slowing time to market.  In fact it seems that there are almost no unbiased works in these areas.  It's difficult to evaluate processes in general, because you're actually comparing teams.  Most of the results I've seen have come from someone pushing their process, whether it's agile, or heavyweight, or whatever.  There is a lot of anecdotal evidence that indicates faster iteration yields higher quality and more features, though.  It's telling that so many of the industry leaders have moved that direction.<p>Yes, I think browsers need frequent releases in order to be competitive.  I don't know if 3 months is the magic number, but it beats the pants off 1 year.  Early standards proposals are refined inside the browsers that ship them first.  This is one of the reasons HTML has been so successful, and it's what HTML5 has tried to continue: standardize what works.  The opposite, where a committee pushes out a standard and everyone then tries to lamely implement it, is a broken process.  Early shipping is a prerequisite for well-formed standards.  Shipping the first beta standards also gives a browser a competitive edge, because they can then argue in favor of their particular flavor of implementation becoming the standard, and they already have that implemented.  Late shipping loses developer mindshare.  ""Oh, I guess I have to install Chrome to try the latest CSS widgetmagicwaffles.""<p>I'll look into the cleanroom process you're describing, but so far you've made it sound unattractive.  It seems like you've been describing a very heavyweight development process.  As for TDD and pair programming, I haven't said anything about those.  Pair programming is completely orthogonal to process weight, and I think TDD is overhyped.  I feel its primary benefit is that it gets a bunch of unit tests written that help avoid regressions.<p>The problem with working with good specs is that they take a long time to get done, and they inevitably have mistakes that have to be corrected during dev, often major mistakes.  While you're building this massive spec, all your engineers are sitting idle, or going brain dead doing spec reviews.  I'm in favor of high-level specs, and the larger the project, the more specific the spec, but I don't for a moment believe that a complete spec is a worthwhile thing.  Let's be honest, this is the waterfall model: gather requirements -> build insanely large spec -> implement to spec -> verify implementation -> maintain<p>I'll look into cleanroom, because it's not something I'm very familiar with, but I have my doubts.  The ""complete spec"" model is extremely expensive.  It makes sense for avionics.  It makes a lot less sense for desktop software.",1308931578

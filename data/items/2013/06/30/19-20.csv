5966949,comment,5966044,5966457,11,0,ChuckMcM,,,"This is a good summary. One of the missing pieces is we don&#x27;t know what the minimum set of combinational factors are to create &quot;advanced&quot; civilization.<p>The scare quotes for advanced here are that two incompatible definitions for civilization quality compete for the nominative &quot;advanced.&quot; In the current context advanced means we&#x27;ve developed machines that carry us into space, we can create habitats to survive in even when our surrounding habitat is inhospitable and we leverage natural resources to create excess food. An alternative context for &quot;advanced&quot; is that your civilization exists in balance with the other processes on the planet, you don&#x27;t create anything that that wouldn&#x27;t be created by natural processes inherent in the system, and your resource utilization is at a rate that does not exceed its replenishment rate. Further you explicitly do not use any resource that is not naturally replenished.<p>In the context of that dichotomy, the question might be &quot;Why didn&#x27;t the Dinosaurs develop space flight?&quot; They lived on the planet for millions of years before we got here, there is evidence that their cognitive capacity was at least as large as ours, and some species had the ability to manipulate matter at least as well as our paleolithic ancestors did. So why didn&#x27;t they build giant Dinosaur cities, grow Dinosaur food, and build institutions of higher learning? Depending on your timeline we went from struggling ape to SpaceX in 3 - 5 million years. They had 165 <i>million</i> years to figure it out. Why were they even <i>on</i> the planet when the asteroid hit, and/or why didn&#x27;t they do something about it before it hit? Using Dinosaur lasers or something.<p>Depending on how you count we&#x27;ve gone through 5 to 7 nearly total extinctions on this planet. What made this last one special? What is the key set of things that have to be true in order for life to go from being intelligent to manipulating everything around it in its environment to serve the will of that intelligence?<p>They are complex questions. Great fun to contemplate on camping trips, while under the influence, and when you&#x27;ve run out of other &#x27;safe&#x27; conversational starters.",1372622045
5966948,comment,5966044,5966489,6,0,VLM,,,"Kraus&#x27;s famous classic &#x27;radio astronomy&#x27; textbook had some comments about this topic toward the end.  If I recall correctly it was a couple light years for analog NTSC.  Nice stable transmitter, satellite disciplined carrier freq toward the end, and the doppler as the earth rotates of a zillion signals gives the little green men something interesting to think about.  Planetary radar, IF aimed directly at the target, had much better range, but analog NTSC television had much better coverage over the whole sky.<p>The radio detection of the earth by broadcast analog NTSC TV carriers has already ended.  The article author specified it as a million years.  We got about fifty instead.  If the LGM are watching our analog TV carriers and the SNR is less than 20 dB or so, there is no way they&#x27;ll see digital as a discrete signal, nor will they likely randomly guess the correct signalling types/codes.<p>The meta issue is as a species we&#x27;re really good at thinking our time is special.  100 years ago watching a spectrogram of analog AM video carriers would have been unthinkable futuristic not even rational to discuss, 25 years ago it would have been a pretty good idea, today its ancient nothing but static, no body would do something so anachronistic.<p>This misbelief in the importance of your time is closely related to one of the funniest atheist arguments, which is so intellectually unthinkable its rarely discussed.  Even the slightest gaze on religious history of the species shows that before the birth of a prophet or whatever, people really thought they had it all figured out almost as well as after.  Because this mis-design-pattern has repeated itself with pretty much all religions in the past, I&#x27;m sure it will happen again in the future, so simply deciding to believe in nothing until the true prophet is born in 100000 years is the most rational decision.  In fact over 100000 years we&#x27;ll probably have about 100 prophets, all of which, however temporarily, being considered the last word in religion...  Its sometimes called the patience atheist argument, or a few other things...  Why, everyone knows the best and most important and most correct culture to ever exist, in the past, or more importantly in the future, is now, of course.",1372622024

This is the consequence of people buying into the War on Terror, among other things.<p>All of this stuff happened for a reason, and that reason was not that the NSA chief or Obama or Bush or anyone else was an evil person drunk on power who just couldn&#x27;t help themselves because they&#x27;re just that bad (or stupid, or whatever). This stuff happened because the electorate and the media and politicians went apeshit after 9/11 trying to point fingers and figure out why none of the intelligence services were able to &quot;connect the dots&quot; and prevent 9/11 from happening. Absolutely everyone was convinced that it was such an eminently preventable catastrophe, and everyone was blaming everyone else to deflect blame from themselves or make it look like they&#x27;re on the ball.<p>The electorate demanded it, ate it up, and demanded more. This is why we have Gitmo. This is why we have torture. This is why we have the Patriot Act and why we have to take our shoes off at the airport and why we&#x27;ve had so much more domestic wiretapping in the past 12 years. None of this stuff is news, and if it is news to anyone they haven&#x27;t been paying attention. Like, at all, on any level. If any of the Snowden stuff is revelatory to you, you have been woefully oblivious to current events for like the past 12 years and are part of the problem.<p>The thing is, none of this stuff is the product of individuals so much as it&#x27;s the product of the system and the electorate. If people were half as vocal about civil liberties as they&#x27;ve been about perceived security then we wouldn&#x27;t be in this situation. Demonizing the people in charge is a natural response, but for the most part they&#x27;re just people trying to do their jobs to the best of their abilities. The real problem is the system itself (meaning, pressures within the government and between the government, the media, and the electorate) and the general lack of focus on, or understanding of, the importance of civil liberties among the population.<p>If the outcome of this is nothing more than a bunch of people get pilloried or lose their jobs, but the core legal framework that allowed this to happen remains in place, then all of this will have been a huge waste of time. It doesn&#x27;t bother me that the NSA exercised powers that they were given and were instructed to use, it bothers me that all of the lawyers who went over this stuff with a fine-toothed comb concluded that this was all perfectly OK given current interpretation of constitutional law.",1372619511

The video shows the basics, and we definitely realize there is much more to building a web app than that.<p>We want to make configuring your app and using common services easy without Kite getting in the way.  Thats our mission.  Although we showed direct shell access to your app in the video, our end goal is to give developers a machine they can call home as their development environment - root access and all.<p>For databases, were making it a simple click to bind a database to your app.  Similar to Heroku, we plan to expose different options as a service and they will be connected to your app through the dj_database_url python module (for Django). For beginners, well try to edit your settings to help make this seamless (your settings.py files in this case).<p>For other services such as email, task queues like Celery, memcached, etc. we plan on taking a similar approach - offer it as a service on a separate machine that can be easily added to your app, or alternatively just install it in your environment if its something very lightweight or serverless (like sqlite).<p>Like other hosting services well provide storage for things like storing user media, static files.<p>Were really aiming to start with development, since theres this large gap between development and prod that creates serious time-wasting problems that each member of our team has felt.  Companies like Heroku are solving the production problem very well, but developers are still left to setup their own environment and deal with problems leading up to prod.<p>That being said, we see the serious benefit in using the same stack for development & production, and, like others have mentioned, testing, staging, CI.  Its definitely on our mind, and wed love to see this kind of fragmentation disappear.<p>Great to see that youre interested, and well definitely be following up with you soon.",1372619486

But I&#x27;m doing enterprise-level architectural programming.  It&#x27;s not very amenable to productizing, so I&#x27;m basically stuck being paid for my time.<p>What that means is that if I want to have a long-term high-security relationship with a couple of key clients, I basically hit a ceiling in hourly rate (a good rate, but slightly below what your general multi-person agency will charge) and I&#x27;ve been at that ceiling for a couple of years now - nowhere close to $250k .<p>It appears the way to transition out is to bump the rate up significantly so it doesn&#x27;t appear you&#x27;re trying to compete with agencies - maybe around $200/hour or 6k-8k/week.  But the problem with that is that the long-term relationships can go out the window.  They only want to bring you in for shorter periods of time, and you have to hustle more.  So the marginal benefit isn&#x27;t awesome.  And I really like my clients and I hate hustling, so I stick with where I&#x27;m at.  This higher rate I&#x27;ve had for the last 2-3 years is nice and all, but practically what it means is that I&#x27;m projected to be able to retire at age 65 instead of age 75.  It&#x27;s not a dramatic difference in lifestyle.<p>So instead, I&#x27;ve just been trying to amass a larger emergency fund outside of maxing my retirement savings every year.  And then I&#x27;ll do something with it... what, I don&#x27;t know.<p>I know, first-world problems, but it seems that now that I finally have a bit of a nest egg, the income-maximizing move would be to use it to invest in one of these other careers the forbes article mentions.  But what?  Nest egg money isn&#x27;t really the limiting factor behind a retail operation, it&#x27;s the actual retail product idea, and I don&#x27;t really think that way.  What&#x27;s left is real estate, but I&#x27;m regularly told I shouldn&#x27;t even bother if I&#x27;m not a fix-it handyman sort, which I&#x27;m not.  So I&#x27;m sort of in this state of perpetual mulling.

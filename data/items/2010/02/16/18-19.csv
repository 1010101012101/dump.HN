Large countries with a large domestic debt market will always look better in that comparison even though the actual debt load may be exactly reversed.<p>I think a much more useful comparison would be to ask what share of personal and government income has to be used for debt servicing and what the trajectory of that number is.",1266346780

And the police arrest him and confirm that he is a terrorist when they find a paper in his apartment with some quotation from the Quran on it and they believe it is some cryptic message/map or something.

However, I choose to act as if I don't like them, for two basic reasons: Most puns are just lazy, lazy puns, but worse, it always turns into a freaking pun war. The horse is ridden, beaten, killed, beaten some more, buried, then the grave is beaten. They also tend to squeeze out all other forms of humor.<p>Why puns are uniquely vulnerable to this, I don't know, but it's pretty constant. Get two punsters in one place and it just becomes a humor wasteland until the mental thesaurus for the topic of the day is totally, utterly exhausted.<p>Choosing to act as if I don't like them causes a net improvement of the local ambient humor.",1266343641

In Rails, for example, the integration for Redis is seven lines of code (they're in my last blog post), and then the Rails cache you know and love is suddenly magic.  It requires no significant amount of developer resources to integrate, minimal sysadmin skills to get running, and coexists beautiful with whatever you use for data persistence right now.  In all of these respects it is a lot like memcached.  (Or like memcachedb except without the periodic disk flush that gives your users 5 second response times.)",1266343464

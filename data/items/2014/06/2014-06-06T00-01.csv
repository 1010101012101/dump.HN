Paying up front, presumably via credit cards, means that the service experience is Uber-smooth.

You simply show up, get treated like royalty, and leave when you&#x27;re ready to.<p>I feel professionally obligated to quibble at one point:<p><i>Most reservation and ticketing systems charge by the number of customer transactions, the number of restaurant admin users, for equipment, or a combination of all three.  The more business a restaurant does, the more they end up paying.\nAs a business owner I hate such models.  Adding an incremental user on my end costs a software company nothing – especially one that has a cloud based system.</i><p>You may discover, in running a software company, that it is really valuable to have the prices which you can charge scale with the success of your users.

To put it in blunt terms: Rich kids graduate; poor and working-class kids don’t.

Poor kids of well-educated parents were far more likely to graduate than rich kids of uneducated parents.<p>Of course, this would reinforce the story being told even more: Parents with college degrees encourage and expect their progeny to attend and graduate from college, while parents without that higher education do not provide an analogous proof of possibility.",1402015695

There are a lot of\npossible &quot;quibbles&quot; with what I wrote.<p>You are correct about the &#x27;vision&#x27; thing -- Tom, Jr.\ndid a very gutsy thing pushing out System 360.  He\nessentially bet the company.  By then IBM was \nwell into computing, e.g., the 7094 based on\ntransistors instead of tubes, but 360 was\nat least two giant steps more.<p>But I do remember\nthat somehow about then DEC was able to do\nthe PDP 10, nice system -- hmm.  Dartmouth\nwas able to do the system that GE used to\nsell time-sharing, etc.  MIT did Multics.\nNet, others were able to write OS software without\nbetting a Fortune 10 or so company on the work.<p>You are fully correct about the anti-trust suit -- in\na sense it made IBM &#x27;gun shy&#x27; and timid for a long time.<p>As I recall, long IBM sold the main chips\nused by Cisco and Juniper.  I can guess that\nIBM gets patent licensing revenue for\ndisk head technology, and maybe the heads\nthemselves.  But the big bucks are in\nselling the drives and the\nsubsystems.<p>I forgot about the sale of Maxtor to Seagate.<p>I guess my broad point was that IBM was essentially\nalways a &#x27;marketing company&#x27; run by successful\nmainframe salesmen.  E.g., once, the day after my wedding,\nI got an offer from the IBM Chicago branch office, and the\nhead there gave me that description of IBM.  They wanted\nme to hold the hands of the oil refining customers using\nlinear programming to make decisions on what inputs to take\nand what outputs to make -- big bucks in that, still.  They had sold a 360/85 and likely wanted to have sold more.  Gee, I might have gotten to work with Ralph Gomory, later head of IBM Research.<p>I guess part of my &#x27;broad point&#x27; was that they kept\nthrowing off their plates little opportunities like\nIntel, Microsoft, Cisco, Oracle, Seagate, EMC, operating the whole\nInternet (can you believe that!), Yahoo (IBM had\nProdigy, good idea, bad execution), OS/2 (ahead of\nanything from Microsoft until Windows NT or 2000),\nNetscape (IBM had a decent Web browser early on), \nWeb servers (&quot;ah, what&#x27;s to do with an Web server;\ntrivial, right?&quot; -- build one easy to program and to serve 10,000 pages a second and then tell me that).<p>PL/I?  Yup!  It was done by a committee headed by \nGeorge Radin in about 1964.  I used PL/I and CP67/CMS to\ndo the first computer based scheduling of the fleet\nat FedEx.  Nicely enough I was paid well \nto learn PL/I by the US DoD at the \nJHU/APL for some work on passive sonar and the\nFFT.  Once I tried to talk to Radin about\noperating systems, and he said, &quot;Three times\nin my career I tried to help IBM in operating\nsystems, and three times I broke my pick trying.&quot;.<p>I remember the sale to Hitachi but didn&#x27;t know that\nthe IBM drives sucked.  I&#x27;ve heard only good things\nabout Hitachi drives; sorry I didn&#x27;t mention them --\nanother quibble.<p>IBM had object oriented programming in\nmicrocode as part of &#x27;Future Systems&#x27;\nin 1980 or was it 1970?<p>But, they were a &#x27;marketing company&#x27; selling to\n&#x27;good IBM customers&#x27;.<p>> Although that also seems to be happening in services.<p>I can believe that.  Long IBM had their pick of\nthe job pool something like Google seems to today;\nlikely no more.<p>So be it.",1402015302

That has some value, yes, but not a lot, because a buy-and-hold investor, of course, doesn&#x27;t execute many trades, so the overhead cost of executing trades is already pretty small for him.<p>Also, most &quot;buy-and-hold&quot; investors hold mutual funds, not stocks, which changes things. See below.<p><i>> costs...can be very important even to value investors when there is some extrinsic prompt to trading</i><p>Yes, but as I just noted, most &quot;buy-and-hold&quot; investors are holding mutual funds, not stocks, so they aren&#x27;t paying the direct costs of stock trading anyway. When I want to rebalance my 401k, I don&#x27;t trade stocks, I trade mutual fund shares, and they&#x27;re all shares of different funds offered by Fidelity or Vanguard or whoever my 401k provider is. (And with most 401k&#x27;s, certainly with the ones I have, as long as you don&#x27;t rebalance too often there is no fee for rebalancing.)<p>So decreasing the overhead cost of trading will only appear to me, if at all, as a decrease in mutual fund fees; but with most 401k&#x27;s the individual doesn&#x27;t see those anyway, because they&#x27;re provided through employers. I don&#x27;t know how much the fee question affects the negotiations between employers and mutual fund providers for setting up 401k&#x27;s, but in any case that&#x27;s at least two layers of indirection between me as a retirement investor and the overhead cost of executing individual stock trades.<p>So I can see some small benefit, yes, but is it enough to offset the high social cost of having so many smart people doing HFT instead of something more productive?",1402014057

If Netflix is paying for the network, why should any of my money go to Verizon?<p>Well, actually, none of my money goes to Verizon. My provider manages to avoid all warnings from Netflix and the graphs from Google show basically 100% of users getting the HD stream. They give me a legitimate 100mbps symmetric (well, almost: <a href=""http://www.speedtest.net/my-result/3546047591"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.speedtest.net/my-result/3546047591</a>) and I&#x27;m paying under $40/mo.<p>If my niche provider can offer that service, Verizon can offer that at scale. The fact that their service is a) worse and b) more expensive means either a) they&#x27;re less competent in running the business or b) they&#x27;re overcharging their customers. Either way, I have zero sympathy for them. They&#x27;re a network provider and people are paying them to connect to the internet. People aren&#x27;t paying them to connect to the subset of the internet that&#x27;s willing to pay Verizon. It&#x27;s already bad enough that TV viewers are seen as the product rather than the customer. Verizon&#x27;s stance here is, once again, treating their subscribers as a product to be leveraged rather than a customer who&#x27;s interests matter. That they can do it is due to their mono/duo-poly that keeps customers from having a choice of providers. But that doesn&#x27;t make it any less offensive.<p>Basically, it boils down to this: if the service costs you more to provide, then charge more to your customers. You can even have a streaming plan that charges customers who stream more than customers who don&#x27;t.

Conceptually, the single exchange is supposed to have a single order book, but because there is unavoidably latency between the multiple computers, computer A&#x27;s current view of the order book may not match computer B&#x27;s.

That means that the new UI has to a whole lot better than the old UI, to make it worth the pain of the learning process. Case in point, the mouse was a much different UI than what we had before, but it has been proven to be far superior, and worth the change. \nchanging the UI just for the sake of change, that is bad for the user. Change it because it will be better (and not just marginally better)",1402012963

Two of them are down near NYU and the other is on the Upper West side, which makes them difficult to access for people living in midtown, uptown and virtually the entire east side.<p>On the upper east side, where I live, the options are pretty much Gristedes, Morton Williams, Food Emporium and Fairway. Gristedes and Morton Williams are overpriced with a bad selection of produce. Food Emporium is worse. Fairway&#x27;s prices are more reasonable and the produce selection is actually quite good, but I tend to think the quality of Whole Foods&#x27; produce is a bit better.",1416121244

I&#x27;m wondering if you used any of them and if you&#x27;ll say that the integration was very straight forward or if it needed to be told a lot to be useful",1416121230

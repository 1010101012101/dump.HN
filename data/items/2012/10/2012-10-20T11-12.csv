Lotteries pay out when your pick of numbers was a better pick than ten million other people; ie, when you get lucky.<p>Economics has repeatedly suggested that the natural logarithm of dollars is an approximation of the utility of money.<p>When you're lucky, you go from 50k to 50m. In logarithms, 10.819 to 17.727. When you're unlucky, you go from 50k to effectively 0. Which is 10.819, to negative infinity - but probably, you'll have enough to live on, so like 1 (0). So you gain almost 7 utility for playing the lottery, but lose more than 10 for not playing the insurance. (The closeness of seven and ten explains why so many uninsured people play the lottery.)",1350734042

You don't have to have a Nobel Prize in econ to see what this miserable dynamic means for publishers' bottom lines.""</i><p>There's room for good websites with well-paid staff who are experts and they can make profit too. Rather than talk about an example from my company, a higher profile one: TechRadar. Their target audience is a little less tech-savvy than me, or most HN readers, but trust me when I say that their staff know what they're talking about - I obviously don't know them all, but I know a few from management down, and they're the bees knees. And they make money. There's plenty of other examples including sites that don't simplify for the audience quite so much.<p>What the current situation with online tech coverage has done isn't to make it impossible to succeed financially, it's just made it far easier to try and do it badly, and with so many more people trying, the percentage of those who succeed naturally drops. It's like if tomorrow anyone could buy an F1 race car - the average ability of drivers would drop way down, but it doesn't mean it's any harder to be a professional racer.",1350732994

Indeed any endeavour that required a fair amount of intelligence, skill, and commitment where you came out above average says something:  starting other businesses and having done better than average comes to mind.<p>In addition to the flaw pg pointed out, the second mistake the article's analysis makes is to ignore the number of opportunities you have;  it seems to assume you have a single opportunity.  In reality, you can make some less than optimal choices in life and still sometimes do just as fine in the end.<p>If you're young I don't see what's wrong with gambling a bit:  if you're 20 and have zero data about how well you will perform, I believe it's still completely rational to aim high.

Affordability is the reason in both cases so I don't understand how this is so easy for you to understand with schools and so baffling with Employer paid health insurance. Do you thing that your HR dept could manage 100 different health care providers? do you think all the providers that you may wish to use are affordable to your company?<p><i>>All of those things are either related to the relationship between you and your employer. The 401k thing is a little funny. I'd rather take the cash and manage it myself. I'm assuming your point is that health care plans are just another form of compensation and if you don't like what's offered, quit and work somewhere else that offers something better. The problem is that 1) coverage chosen by the employer can change every year, 2) you can't get the same coverage at the same price on your own or at a small company, and 3) it's non-optimal because it bundles unrelated things and requires you, as a ""consumer"" of employment, to make your decisions based on the aggregate value instead of individual values of the components.</i><p>Money is a finite thing to your company and I just don't understand how you are baffled that you can't choose whatever health care you wish through your company.

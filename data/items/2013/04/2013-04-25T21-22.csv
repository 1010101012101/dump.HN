Also, I do not think that 'normal' methods of documentation would work all that well in these cases either. What you would really want as documentation for this type of function is more along the lines of a proof of the algorithm being used. Then you just implement the algorithm in as close a way possible to the construction in the proof and document deviations.<p>At one point I was browsing through a crypto-library (I forget which one). Almost all of the crypto functions used short variable names, and had only a one line comment. That comment is a citation for the paper that the algorithm came from. Ignoring the fact that the code authors were not the source of the crypto (so putting the explanation in the source may be plagourism or such), source code is not a good format for this type of thing.",1366927057

Until you get your head around the idea that you're describing ""what"" you're building rather than how to build it, you'll feel an impedance mismatch.<p>And I didn't begin to feel mastery with Maven until I started writing plug-ins.  If you really want to understand your tool, then try extending it.  I've never had issues with Maven builds missing files, etc. and I'm not really sure how that happens.  On the other hand, the fact that the project structure is almost always the same from project to project lets me successfully dive into projects I've never touched.<p>But Maven can be complex, especially if you're not careful to segment your project into sub-projects and modules.  There are parts that are best learned by working with someone who's already mastered the build system.  In any case, I think make/autoconf are harder to grasp than Maven, and I've never hated it the way I do when I'm programming in XML (Ant).",1366926953

Again, great correlation here in the post where black = luxury/power.<p>But thinking to my own personal experience with design, Leo's quote stands out to me:<p>""Despite all the studies, generalizations are extremely hard to make.

That would have been plenty to charge this guy with, and would have meant a lengthy maximum sentence of fifteen years in prison.<p>The CFAA charges have a maximum penalty of five years in prison <i>per charge</i>.  So with all six charges, the maximum penalty was thirty five years.<p>All charges carried a maximum $250000 fine.  Again, the CFAA charges more than doubled the maximum penalty.<p>Really though, what is your point in asking?  This is laid out in rayiner's link, anyone can read it.  Yes, the judge has leeway in deciding the penalty, but that is not really the issue; the issue is that a defendant facing 35 years faces a much harder choice than a defendant facing 15 years.  The CFAA violations are an example of a typical prosecutor strategy of pressuring defendants into making a guilty plea, and of trying to reduce the likelihood of an acquittal.",1366926857

There are hundreds of thousands of people in over 150 countries who have pre-ordered Leap Motion controllers, some as long as a year ago. These people are part of our community and there is nothing more important to us than getting them devices as quickly as possible.<p>Weve made a lot of progress. When we first started taking orders back in May we were twelve (very tired) people in a basement. Now we are eighty (although still tired and possibly still in a basement). Weve manufactured over six hundred thousand devices and delivered twelve thousand to amazing developers who are building applications that let people do things that just wouldnt have been possible before.<p>These developers have given us great feedback that weve used to make huge improvements to the stability and polish of the product. Were really proud of Leap Motion as both a company and a product.<p>The reality is we very likely could have hit the original ship date. But it wouldnt have left time for comprehensive testing. This will come in the form of a beta test that will start in June. We will give the 12k developers who currently have Leap Motion controllers access to the feature complete product including OS interaction (today developers only have access to the SDK). We will also invite some people who are not developers to join the beta test.<p>David and I will be participating in an open video Q&A using Google Hangout tomorrow at 11:30am Pacific time. To join our hangout, please visit our Google+ page. If you have any questions please dont hesitate to contact our support team at support@leapmotion.com or my personal email (buckwald@leapmotion.com). As always, we will not charge pre-order customers credit cards until the devices have actually shipped.<p>Original email (http://pastebin.com/DBaPZXFQ)",1366926658

I mean, this month I need a bunch of rack and stack help (but I'm willing to take you through setting up several brands of switches, if you sign on before I set 'em up myself)  I can pay $15/hr on a 1099, (remember, that means you pay both the employer and employee payroll taxes, so at minimum, that means you are paying 7.5% more of that as taxes than you would as a w2.  Plus tax calculation effort and stuff.) but I've got a kinda informal headhunting deal with a buddy who needs similar skills.  He pays a little more (full time, though, and w/ health benefits, on a w2, and I think he would pay like $15-$18/hr, but between the w2 and the benefits, that's significantly better than the $15 on a 1099.)   I point him at good folks who work for cheap, and instead of giving me a recruiting bonus, he lets me rent you back at a discounted rate.    So yeah, if you are in silicon valley, drop me an email (in my profile) and call your first few days 'paid interview'  and maybe you get a full time gig with that other guy?<p>(I hire people full-time with benefits, too- but right now, I don't have enough revenue to hire another full-time.  I do need some help moving, though, which is why that shady deal with my buddy is so good for me;  I get some per-day work, but can attract someone that wants to be full time, and thus end up paying closer to full-time rates.)<p>I am okay with a full-day minimum;  I'm not expecting you to show up for an  hour for $15, and I usually get lunch or dinner or something.<p>But yeah;  I don't know.  Napoleon's hat on the battlefield is worth 50,000 men.   - most people expect /leadership/  -  and most people think leadership involves motivating people through personal charisma and confidence.<p>Personally?  I understand how bad leadership can destroy value, but I don't really see how good leadership (in the personal charisma sense) can help anything.  I think good leaders pick good people, (or, at least, the best people available considering the compensation the company can afford.) then mostly get out of the way.   I mean, i do a lot of ""no, don't spend time on that, this other thing is more important""  - like today, I redirected an employee away from working on new images and towards improving our per-port BCP38.   And I do training, too, but that's really more experienced individual contributor type work.<p>(And as for Napoleon, after the french revolution?  the french soldiers were treated better than any of their contemporaries, and I think that had a lot to do with their success.  I mean, I'm not entirely discounting Napoleon, but ""Libert, galit, fraternit,""  I think, really had a lot to do with his success.  It's not a unique strategy; every Caesar since, well, Caesar has used populist rhetoric and policies to gain and keep power, but at that time?  the rest of the world really treated their soldiers poorly, and France was, at least in Europe, uniquely populist.)",1366926173

5610091,comment,5608768,5608768,1,0,nathantotten,,,"I actually think that software plays a huge role in causing this horrible customer service from airlines as well. I am a frequent flyer on American (125k miles last year) and have had numerous experiences that led to this conclusion. One experience in particular happened on a recent trip to Europe.<p>On this particular trip I was flying on a code-share BA flight (this means a flight I bought as AA, but flew on a BA plane). Normally with my flyer status I can upgrade to a good seat without issue. I was however booked in a terrible middle seat on my return flight. I called AA and they couldn't figure out how to upgrade me. I called BA, same thing. I called American Express Travel, they couldn't figure it out either. The response I got from everybody was very helpful (I get better customer service than most people, due to my flyer status), but they simply couldn't figure out how to actually make the change in their system. When I got to Heathrow, I asked a BA agent at the counter if she could change my seat. She couldn't figure it out so she called another person over who was more experienced. This lady then 'hacked' away on her terminal for literally 10 minutes. She was giving me updates the entire time on what she was doing. She tried a variety of different options to change my ticket until she found one that worked.<p>While there certainly is a human aspect and a policy aspect to bad customer service with Airlines, I believe that some of the problem is the result of the customer service representatives having to deal with really really bad software. Most of them simply don't actually know how to make the changes that customers want so they just tell them it isn't possible. My guess is that if the airline industry was able to massively upgrade their software you would see a huge improvement in customer service simply because the representatives would actually be able to accomplish the requested tasks.",1366926128

I have never* noticed a program not work because off this, including the applet icons. The main point to consider in this is that most of the programs that Ubuntu runs are not written, nor maintained, for Ubuntu. Therefore, they should work perfectly well with other desktops. 
The only incompatibility that Unity introduces is when you are actually using Unity. When you are using another desktop, a program that works in another distro should work just as well. 
If you install, for example, the package ""mate-session-manager"", you will install a traditional desktop, and still be running Ubuntu. There are many other desktops to choice from in the Ubuntu repositories. Admittadly, installing one not in the repos will be more complicated.<p>* I have actually run into 1 problem (with java) arising from the fact that Awesome is a non-re-parenting WM.

5609910,comment,5609399,5609399,28,0,ChrisNorstrom,,,"Evolution wise, this is because people like in others, what they wish they had for themselves. Likewise, people hate in others what they dislike about themselves. We celebrate the beautiful because we wish we too could be beautiful. We mock the ugly/short/gay/fat/skinny/weak because those are qualities that we ourselves do not wish to have. If all of society punishes those with these traits, people with these traits will be less likely to reproduce and pass these traits on to future generations. Nature is as always, brutal.<p>But because we humans have emotions we try to hide these discriminations and pretend we don't have them.<p>I always thought it was interesting how women with self-image issues are comforted on talk shows and told ""honey you are beautiful just the way you are!"" in one episode then ""oh my God you look so much better!"" after they get a makeover in the next episode. Not to mention the irony of women in the crowd (who will spend hundreds of hours each year putting on makeup, doing hair, bleaching, & plucking) clapping to the tune of ""you're beautiful just the way you are"".<p>My angry bitterness comes from the fact that my whole life I've been lied to. I was a cute kid but after puberty it all went downhill. I was the first to realize it. I was hoping the world around me would keep it's promise of treating me nicely because after all, ""it's what's on the inside that counts"". Yet, it was all a lie. I've had friends tell me I was ugly, I've had friends tell me they initially didn't want to be associated with me because I was ugly. I've had people in public say to me (as I'm walking by) ""Damn dude, you're ugly"". And if I choose to get cosmetic surgery some day, I'll have a whole new group of people calling me ""shallow"". Why? Because I want to look nice? God I'm just so sick of this bullshit. I don't hate myself, I hate the world that lied to me. People who say one thing, then do another.<p>The same people who call plastic surgery recipients as ""shallow"" are the same ones who lie to themselves and refuse to acknowledge how important it can be to look nice and feel good about yourself. How happy the millions of people who get surgery every year feel when they have a nose straightened out or a wrinkle removed or hollow cheeks filled.<p>People tend to believe lies that make them feel good rather than accepting truths that make them feel bad. I'm glad I live in 2013 when I can change the way I look so I can have a better life instead of lapping up all that ""it's what's on the inside"" bullshit so many people keep spreading so they can look empathetic and modest in front of others.<p>My Point: I'd like 3 things to change in our society:<p>1) No more lying. No more ""We're all beautiful"" rhetoric. No everyone is not beautiful. That's bullshit. Let's be honest. A few people are beautiful, most are average, many can be unattractive, and some are apparently repulsive enough to instill feelings of negativity in others. Beauty can also be subjective so there's a bit of give here and there.<p>2) To be more understanding towards people who are unattractive by removing the stigma that comes with being unattractive. Aka don't treat us differently. Example: All my friends are outcasts, people rejected by others because they were unattractive, too fat, too skinny, too black (Nigerian descent). Despite me admitting that many of my friends are unattractive themselves, I was still their friend. I was never embarrassed to be their friend or be seen with them.<p>3) To not look down on people who want to better themselves through cosmetic surgery. Cosmetic surgery is still looked down upon by many people. If you take a leave of absence for 2 weeks and come back with a different face your co-workers will respond negatively. To redefine oneself is what makes humans human. Stop judging cosmetic surgery by looking at extreme examples like Dolly Parton, Joan Rivers, and Michael Jackson. Those are extreme edge cases. Walk into any plastic surgeons offices and ask for their before/after books. Most surgery is meant to leave the patient looking natural not unrecognizable.<p>For instance: <a href=""http://www.drrichardjoseph.com/photos/jaw-surgery.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.drrichardjoseph.com/photos/jaw-surgery.php</a> Are they shallow for looking better?",1366924552

They say that a tube consisting of 20 concentric rings that is about ten times longer than it is wide, should transmit about 90 per cent of a magnetic field at one end to the other.  Indeed, a tube of just 2 concentric rings should transmit about 75 per cent.<p>""About 75 percent"" is a stretch, at least if the article author and I are looking at the same paper. According to the actual paper, in figure 2e, it looks closer to 68 or 69 percent. Not a huge nit pick though.<p>>These guys have tested this idea with a single superconducting tube 7 cm long (made of BiPbSrCaCuO) and filled with a ferromagnetic alloy (of cobalt and iron).<p>How much does a superconducting tube of BiPbSrCaCuO that is 10 times as long as it is wide cost to manufacture? How much does it cost to keep it cool enough to superconduct? It's billed as a high Tc (108 K) superconductor from the manufacturer (Can), but there is no price list to be found. Figure 4a in the paper seems to indicate that this effect is indeed only observed with a superconducting tube with a ferromagnet core.<p>Regardless, it's still a cool effect to see in action! If there's an actual physicist in the room, I'd love to hear more about Chapter four in the paper. It seems that the discretization to more than just a single Superconductor-Feromagnet pair --figure 2e in the paper is the main graph showing the efficiency gains as the number of pairs goes up-- was done using FET, after a brief justification argument that goes over my head, and was not actually produced and measured in lab.

5609851,comment,5609546,5609809,58,0,tolmasky,,,"So the way I look at this critique is that most people in the US are running a parallel experiment with their bodies, only instead of the input being Soylent, it's garbage like fast food. It's true, we <i>don't understand</i> how the human body operates - whether you're eating McDonald's, or organic, or Soylent. So given that the baseline seems to be an equally untested and probably more detrimental food choice, this completely voluntary experiment doesn't seem so bad, it's not like the govt is teaching us to eat a certain way (which they have been known to do incorrectly). In other words, Soylent vs theoretically ideal diet (which we don't even know) - sure, bad choice. But the reality is for the target audience (such as myself) its Soylent vs pizza and burgers, which doesn't seem that bad.",1366923909

It's been alleged that diabetes is caused by overconsumption of processed sugar and heart disease is caused by overconsumption of red meat.  Either of those things in moderation is fine.<p>Most people don't eat a consistent dose of for instance oat powder every day.  It's likely that he's chosen at least one ingredient that is harmless in moderation, but is detrimental to your health over time.<p>It's also quite possible that there are other things he's underdosing on and hasn't discovered yet (like sulphur before batch #7).",1366923890

Given enough input data, it should learn location-invariant representations like bag-of-words / n-grams (or even better ones) itself, right?",1366923884

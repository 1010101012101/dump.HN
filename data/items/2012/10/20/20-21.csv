4678203,story,,,1,0,amerf1,"Why Facebook acquired instagram",,"Since 2004, Facebook has allowed users to create a personal profile, add friends and share content with them in a very easy to use platform. But let's be honest there's a ton of social media websites out there that do exactly that. so why facebook?<p>Well, facebook sticks to the point and that's what made it very popular, it doesn't offer you features you don't need and since you're there for  interaction they'll give you interaction allright<p>However, with the evolution of social media and looking at how simple it has become to share content, there are many websites that come up with simpler solutions for your social media needs. The best example is twitter. While Twitter and Facebook may seem entirely different in their focuses, Almost all my friends have switched from facebook to twitter and we barely even use facebook anymore. Why? well because Twitter is very simple and extremely easy to use and guess what? it's got a photo sharing feature as well thanks to instagram.<p>Now why is twitter taking the spotlight again? because we want less text and more pictures, the world has become a place where we want to see and not read anymore, a little bit of reading is fine, but we want more graphics and pictures.<p>Facebook might have made their best investment by acquiring instagram, because the next ""facebook"" is going to be a platform that uses less text input and more picture/video input and so Facebook saw the need to position themselves competitively.",1350766601

4678186,comment,4677052,4677965,1,0,davismwfl,,,"Actually, I would say that at least in the division I was in we took 360 reviews very seriously.<p>So for example if a mgr had bad peer and subordinate reviews but a positive manager review HR would step in and force a resolution.  If none of (or only a minority of) your peers or subordinates trust you it didn't matter what your manager thought. Now that said training was always the first thing to try, which in fairness we did with any knowledge worker.<p>As for contributions and measuring impact yes, the entire team had bonuses based on performance and results. In fact we tracked milestones to expected costs and if a team beat it they were rewarded. Not just a team lead but the whole team. I so hated filling out WBS cards.<p>While I was there we had three changes in various leadership positions because of team dynamics.  Honestly, at least in my group my complaint was sometimes to high a sensitivity to team grumbling.<p>But I know there were places in the organization where protecting management was done, which is complete BS in my book.<p>I also totally disagreed with some arbitrary numbers we had to meet, like having a certain percentage of our project developed offshore.

Fat pipes are _expensive_, there are few hosting providers that allow you to have a dedicated line more than 1 Gbps.<p>Supposedly their Business plan ($200/month) protects against this, and their free plans protect much smaller amounts of traffic.<p>You can prevent against some common resource exhaustion attacks (SYN floods) by having a proper firewall setup.<p>CloudFlare has been known to let the attack traffic route to your server if it's big enough.",1350766042

You see on my paid account under the tools ""Manage this account"" there is a support tab, and that tab lets you send email to a real person with your account id and generally they respond reasonably quickly. So what what did they say? Now the poster says ""locked out of his account"" what did that mean? Can't login? Or can't send email? Can't use Drive? Can't use Calendar? Was it just him or everyone who uses the account?

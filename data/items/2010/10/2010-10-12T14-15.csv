That's right: Although you've been admonished all your life to ""sit up straight,"" the healthiest posture seems to be considerably more laid-back - 135 degrees back, in fact. When researchers in Scotland and Canada scanned the backs of 22 healthy men and women as they assumed three sitting postures - sitting straight at a 90-degree angle, hunching forward, and leaning back 135 degrees - they were surprised to find that the spine was actually least stressed in the laid-back position. The worst? Sitting ramrod-straight created the most disc movement and strain on the spine.<p>""Sitting unsupported puts more pressure and stress on your lumbar spine than standing,"" says Scott L Blumenthal, M.D., a spine surgeon at the Texas Back Institute.

But I don't think it's the best way to finance your company and hope that our firm can avoid them.""<p>I get that the VCs themselves might like to have more control over what they are investing in. The entrepreneurs, however, usually feel that they know best what their startups need. From the point of view of the entrepreneur, one way of retaining control of one's company is to be sure each VC has only a small slice of the company. Most of us who have been following the startup scene for awhile remember what happened to Phillip Greenspun, and the clever way the VCs were able to take his company away from him. Most of us who are thinking about starting our own startups want to avoid that fate.<p>And I think there is a much larger context that should be considered. The USA went into recession in December of 2007, and in September of 2008, it suffered a financial crisis that caused markets all over the world to seize up, leading to the worst post-war recession in the USA, and triggering crisises in many other countries.<p>The point is this: yields have collapsed.<p>Last week, 30 year USA Treasuries traded for 3.676%. Think about it. If you would like to give the government a million dollars, the government will happily give you $36,760 a year for the next 30 years. (Several key rates hit all time lows last week.) If you would like to get so rich that you can live comfortably on your asset income forever, you will need… uh, wow. Being a millionaire is not what it used to be.<p>The amazing thing here is not the low rate, but that this is for 30 years – anyone who buys at this rate is essentially investing in the idea that inflation will not return to the USA for several decades. Honestly, my mind staggers at the implications.<p>In this context, it is not surprising that we might get a glut of VCs, a glut of equity funding, and VCs having to settle for small slices. Startups are one of the only things in the world that can still promise the possibility of exciting returns. If I was rich, I’d be out chasing yield too. And I'd be willing to settle for just a slice of a startup. I'd be putting my money into VC funds, hoping to find a way to get better than a 4% return.<p>I do get the argument that the best VCs offer a kind of guidance that goes way beyond the value of the money they invest. But my point is, a glut of money chasing yield must lead to a glut of VCs, and that means most VCs will not be at the level of Paul Graham or Fred Wilson. Most VCs will be somewhat mediocre. The more money that sloshes into the VC market, the more new, inexperienced VCs there will be. Their money will, in fact, be the main thing they have to offer.",1286894439

Most people think of it as a band-aid solution used by people who don't know databases but to me doing things without coding using Excel's built-in functions is like those 1k/5k competitions - how much can you do with so little?<p>Here's my favorite problem that I'd like someone else to take a stab at:<p>Sheet1:A1-A999 (source) is an unsorted list of alphanumeric strings, with lots of repeats. Without using macros/VBA/scripting code, put all the unique strings in Sheet2:A1-A### (destination) such that any changes in source list is reflected in the destination automatically (auto calculate option is enabled). Destination list should have no more than 1 blank row. You cannot use any sorting/grouping functions manually. It has to be completely automatic. I want to delete the entire source worksheet, paste 399 items, insert 400 more, paste in another 300, and delete 100 of the rows randomly, and when I switch to the destination, it should have my list ready.<p>Bonus points if the destination list is sorted. Double bonus if you don't use any {array} functions.<p>Hint: You would be using functions like VLOOKUP/MATCH/ADDRESS/INDIRECT and similar.<p>So why is a problem like this useful? Because if destination is generated completely dynamically using items from the source, you can pull in dynamic web data into the source and have your Excel work reliably even if macros/scripting are disabled. Also, you can have users log in manual data into the source and you can generate the summary of their data in the destination without having to rely on any code or external service.",1286894264

Some are already noted in this thread, but to add a few more:<p>- In this rebuttal Sorkin says that the party sequence is something Mark is imagining and seems to suggest that's right out of Mark's blog. I don't see how this can be supported by what was in the film; it is depicted as a real event. I don't see anything in Mark's blog (at least those few pages commonly quoted on the web) to support the contention it's Mark's fantasy.<p>- For most of the period the movie covers, the real Zuckerberg has a girlfriend and is an athlete himself -- he's a fencer. The movie Zuckerberg is a dateless wonder who believes athletics are beyond him.<p>- In a sequence that only a Hollywood screenwriter could have invented, interns are tested by hacking into a ""python webserver running SSL (??)"" while being forced to drink shots according to highly implausible rules. The script actually has stage directions for HOT ASIAN WOMEN pouring shots to be stationed a pace behind (!!) each male hacker.<p>Sorkin defends himself in this rebuttal by noting that the Erica Albright character, and the unnamed lawyer at the end, are Mark's moral superiors. But that's a form of sexism too, when you only have ""good girls"" and ""bad girls"".<p>The movie is clearly setting these two kinds of women in opposition and had to wildly exaggerate things in order to get there. The movie Mark Zuckerberg is frustrated he can't win the respect of ""good"" women like Erica as a peer, so he attempts to rise above the entire social system by creating Facebook, and thus enters a more narcissistic world (embodied by Sean Parker) in which ""bad"" women are mere accessories.<p>As a movie it works. As a programmer I am disturbed that so much innocent tomfoolery as well as brilliant creativity are dismissed as embodiments of misogyny.<p>For the record, I'm not a fan of Facebook or even Mark Zuckerberg. But many people, even smart people, are taking the movie at face value as a depiction of the real Mark Zuckerberg. I've seen feminist writer Naomi Klein quoting this ""Facebook was born in a night of misogyny"" thing too. It looks like this is destined to be part of Zuckerberg's legacy, whether he deserves it or not.",1286893636

When Microsoft is the subject of a discussion, an assertion about their motivations is not an ad hominem: An assertion about one of the persons participating in the debate would be an ad hominem.<p>So what we have is an assertion about Microsoft's motivations and an unfounded argument that this is the cause for some perceived product woes. This is clearly weak rhetoric (and trivially fallacious: Apple seems to do just fine lusting after money).<p>But I am left rubbing my chin in confusion by your assertion that using the nickname automatically means that you're arguing that there is a problem with their products. My understanding is that the problem with their products is that have no taste. Someone using ""M$"" could be thinking that their avarice means that they behave in monopolistic ways, or that they have a certain type of internal company culture, or any number of things.<p>But there is no need to assume what they are saying or to jump to some conclusion about what they are claiming: I can simply read what they write. If they write ""M$ are unable to ship good products,"" I can argue with that statement directly instead of arguing with their use of the nickname.<p>As for your second paragraph... Wow. Imagine if I were to make up a whole list of things that people are <i></i>not<i></i> saying and use it to stir up all kinds of emotional feelings as a way of trying to convince you that using a nickname I don't like was pathetic. Would that add to the discussion?<p>I think I am going to stop right here. I see a nickname that claims Microsoft cares primarily or only about money. You see a nickname dragging all sorts of baggage and claims and unfounded arguments around. You feel the need to exert social pressure to eliminate it, including characterizing it in an insulting fashion (""juvenile"").<p>I understand what you are saying, and that is quite enough for me.",1286892519

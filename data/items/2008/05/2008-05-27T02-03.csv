Hopefully people will realize that you can write horrifyingly bad code in any language.  I'm looking forward to the Python edition ;)<p>Maybe we can start approaching language design rationally when people start realizing that all languages suck big time.  Even Ruby.  Even Lisp.",1211857058

200632,comment,200562,200562,0,0,anonym,,,"""We now have technologies that effectively mix web and desktop technologies, something I like to call 'webtop clients', manifest in Adobe Flash Player, Java Applets, and Microsoft Silverlight.""<p>1. Flash is used for: video, music, ads (usually also only to enable video), and sites for the sort of web design shops you don't want to hire. Also, games, a special case. When was the last time you saw Flash used to recreate a desktop-GUI-style app? That OpenLaszlo (sp?) sure is taking the world by storm, eh?<p>2. Nobody uses Java applets.<p>3. Nobody uses Silverlight.<p>Statelessness is the core strength of the web, and the core strength of web applications. The limitations the web naturally imposes make for better applications and a better user experience than the GUI paradigm. (Every time I hear about some great new continuation-based web framework, there's always an example showing how easy it is to create the equivalent of a modal dialogue, and I always want to hit the writer over the head with a copy of a decent book on interface design. <i>Modes are bad!</i> Statelessness is good! The resource-centric model is good! Users like these things for the same reason you like REST better than SOAP and modular code rather than otherwise — people don't do modes!<p>(Sorry for the rant, these GUI partisans get me riled up.)",1211856876

200628,comment,200502,200615,0,0,DaniFong,,,"We have different opinions on what's important in a language. I want something that's as fast to write as prose, so that my mind can focus on other things in the problem domain. This may mean that my code is rather unreadable to people used to coding in specific idioms. But functionality is commented at a higher level, so then what are they doing reading individual statements from my code anyway?<p>This means that, sometimes, I find myself in opposition to the python community for its goals of readability and regularity, but it's a powerful language chalk full of good ideas and one of the most important tribes on the net, so I still use it.",1211856270

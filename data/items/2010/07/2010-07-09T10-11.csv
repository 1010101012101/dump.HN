Nowhere in the story does it say that Slashgear made any attempt to contact Apple and ask about this situation.  Apple has an entire media department that you can call and ask (<a href=""http://www.apple.com/pr/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.apple.com/pr/</a>).<p>The worst case is that Apple will give you a no comment, or we'll get back to you.  That you can report.  But here all we have is a sentence wasted burbling <i>And considering that NDrive isn’t the only GPS application available on the iPhone, or within the App Store proper, we’re not sure why Apple would choose now, or this app, to pull that lever.</i><p>At the start of the article they claim <i>That would mostly be because Apple hasn’t had any reason to use it</i>.  Is that true?  Did they ask Apple?<p>If you follow the blog chain backwards you'll come to someone who did call Apple, and has a possible explanation for why the application was removed: <i>it appears NDrive may not have fully licensed the map data used in the application</i>.<p>The entire article would be much more interesting if they'd called Apple and asked them a few questions.  And then called NDrive and asked them about the map licensing, or called Teledata and asked them.  You know, actually done some work towards the article rather than 'reporting' rumors.<p>Also, they need someone to look over their copy.<p><i>Several customers are reporting that the application called NDrive, which was developed by a small team to be a GPS alternative.</i><p>What did the customers do?  Also, I'm pretty sure this small team did not develop an alternative to GPS.  That would have required launching and maintaining a large number of satellites.<p><i>And then subsequently pulled from customer’s iPhones as well.</i><p>One customer or many?<p>Some months ago I wrote a blog post about baggage tags used on airlines (<a href=""http://blog.jgc.org/2009/08/whats-on-baggage-tag.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.jgc.org/2009/08/whats-on-baggage-tag.html</a>).

The advantages Minix has to offer doesn't solve every problem, least of all the wetware problem that there will always be bugs. But if you're after a high reliability system, say a plane, you don't want a bug in the audio driver making the navigation systems crash. Who cares if the warning signals sound a little weird for a second, if the system is still running correctly, apart from the audio?<p>The less that is tied into the kernel, the less can crash the system easily. The disk driver could certainly overwrite the kernel on disk, and that could be... pretty bad, but no system that doesn't in some way verify that the code is correct can ever protect against this sort of programmer caused bug.<p>It should also be noted that Minix isn't exactly aimed as a replacement for linux, and I'm not one hundred percent sure that making such a comparison is that useful.",1278672781

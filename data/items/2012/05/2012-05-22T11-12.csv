I still find myself wondering if we aren't in an <i>advertising</i> bubble instead, with social media a rider and not a driver per se of the trend. Advertising is and always shall be a very important part of the economy, but there's also this sharp bound on exactly how much money it can move around since it needs to result in net profit for the advertiser. Google definitely has demonstrated they have a superior platform. I'm not sure anybody else has. Not just Facebook, anybody else.<p>If there's any element of this bubble that reminds me of the previous it is that there are still an awful lot of startups out there who are trying to simply acquire as many users as possible with vague plans to figure out how to make money later... and they all seem to come up with the same, ""Uh... shove ads at them, I guess?"" plan in the end.",1337687052

4007335,comment,4006150,4007257,13,0,unalone,,,"That's a simplification that might lead you to a mistaken conclusion.<p>Some creative sorts thrive on strife, it's true; and these sorts look for people who operate the same way so they can thrust themselves at one another, grow heated, and still get work done. That is not the only way things get done, it is not an inescapable approach (many people use that as an excuse to avoid acting like grown-ups), and, most importantly, there is a time and a place for that <i>and it's not at the center of an open community.</i><p>Look, the idea of open source is this glorious idea that when people work together they can achieve things which no one person would have thought of on their own. My favorite open source works are the result of somebody having a crazy idea, getting support from various open source projects, and making something they'd have never made on their own. Having the sorts of misanthropic terrors that this guy's writing about in positions where they can alienate other participants undermines one of the clearest values of open source work.<p>What's more, the Internet SUCKS at strife. Arguing is one thing where you can see and hear and intuit the person you're arguing with. You stay in lockstep with them, even if you're fighting them bitterly. Arguments on the Internet are much more commonly the result of people simply not understanding tone, or even who the shit's on the other side. They are rarely productive in the way you mean. When you've got an issue OF community bullying, they are practically never productive. If one person feels the need to start fight with masses of people, even if it's because they don't ""understand"" him, that person is pretty much in the wrong, and ruining things for those other people.<p>To be honest it makes me sad that programmers and computer geeks, who are both smart enough and used enough to being ostracized and belittled, so often decide that the problem with their former persecution was simply that they weren't the ones getting to do the persecuting. And the strain of celebrity-worship that leads to other coders excusing the worst behavior simply because it comes from a well-known name is equally disappointing.

Contrary to popular ignorance, the reason people get fat is simply due to a caloric excess. The idea is that if your maintenance intake is 2500kcal/day, and you eat exactly that much, you will not gain (store) or lose (use) any fat (energy). So even if you eat three meals a day consisting solely of chow mein and orange chicken from delivery, and all meals add up to be 2500kcal, you will not fluctuate in body fat percentage. Of course, you will otherwise have terrible health due to the high consumption of saturated fats and sodium, but that's another story.<p>In this vein, I think everyone should tally caloric intake for a week and compare it to their daily caloric needs which can be calculated using all sorts of tools (e.g. <a href=""http://www.exrx.net/Calculators/CalRequire.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.exrx.net/Calculators/CalRequire.html</a>).<p>Hopefully this discussion is not completely irrelevant, but I thought it was all worth noting.

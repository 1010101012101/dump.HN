I had no issues whatsoever for <i>decades</i> of uber-nerdy computing, then blammo, I went from, ""my neck seems tense"" to ""my left index finger is numb and I can't sit at a computer for more than an hour"" in a couple of months.  An ex, who had previously been a massage therapist, even specifically warned me that I had problems in the upper back area, but since I felt no discomfort I ignored her.<p>Here's the really bothersome part:  while this awful neck/back injury was developing, things that were terrible for me actually felt good.  For example, having one leg crossed over the other, left arm on my knee, slouching forward with my chin resting on my hand.  It felt like a great neck stretch but, wow, was it ever demolishing my neck!<p>As for RSI with regards to the wrist and hands, I don't see how proper posture could <i>exacerbate</i> wrist pain.  If it does, I would suspect that you need to examine other factors, like keyboard height and hand placement width (e.g. my Kinesis puts my hands much further apart than a standard keyboard, which makes a <i>huge</i> difference in wrist pain).<p>By the way, did you know that modern shirts are actually cut differently than decades past, because the average person's shoulders have rotated significantly forward?  If you try to maintain posture in a typical, modern shirt, you'll have bunching in weird places because it's not cut for that!",1313542254

2893517,comment,2892746,2892746,1,0,felipemnoa,,,"Here is the relevant piece:<p>There's a section in Popular Crime where you create a mathematical system that could be used by juries in order to deduce an accused person's guilt, built around a list of criteria. It's basically a weighted point system. The example you use is Lizzie Borden,6 who you feel was not guilty (as least according to this point system). However, two murders were committed that day, and there does not appear to be any potential suspect except Lizzie Borden. She seems to be the only real option. So what do you make of Sherlock Holmes' fictional axiom that states, ""When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth""? If there is no other explanation for the Borden murders, what else are we supposed to conclude?<p>That Sherlock Holmes line is very, very interesting. It's false, and extremely arrogant, and very dangerous. That's not a real way to think about the world. This concept of eliminating the impossible  we could never do that. The whole idea of Sherlock Holmes is dangerous because it encourages people to think that  if they're intelligent enough  they could put all the pieces together in absolute terms. But the human mind is not sophisticated enough to do that. People are not that smart. It's not that Sherlock Holmes would need to be twice as smart as the average person; he'd have to be a billion times as smart as the average person.",1313542001

PostgreSQL's EXPLAIN output says that it's _not_ (and from what I can tell so far, this is a deliberate design decision by PostgreSQL developers).  r17 ""loses"" to MySQL on one query and ""wins"" on the other.  So I agree that r17 has a much harder job competing against indexed data...but with r17 you didn't have to wait to create the index....not such a big deal for OLTP, a much bigger deal with OLAP.<p>I would like to redo the bakeoff(s) with compressed InnoDB tables but as they can take several days to run and life is short, first I should focus on Hadoop as we both agree that is more relevant.<p>Re the data size issue: the 54GB raw data set compresses to 28GB.  The data generator I use creates data that's more random than the ""real world"" and so doesn't compress very well...makes life harder for r17, which is what I want.  The smaller data set for the SSD test compresses to about 13GB, which isn't ideal I agree...I should have bought a larger SSD, I didn't think that MySQL would make so many large temporary files :).  To mitigate this issue I ensured that the data set was _not_ cached before I ran the r17 script.<p>I am very keen to find out the truth about r17's usefulness, thanks for your part in that.

<p>Welcome to FTP.FUNET.FI aka NIC.FUNET.FI<p>This is a Dell R710 server with 72GB of RAM and dual Quad-Core Nehalem
EP processors (Intel Xeon E5540) giving 16 CPU threads. Storage is
provided via fibre channel connections to the CSC Storage Area
Network. Currently it uses 20TB on a EMC CX700 RAID subsystem for
ZFS storage and it can be extended on the fly if required.<p>Operating system is Solaris 10 Unix from Sun Microsystems. We have a
10Gbit/s dedicated connection to Funet which connects at 10Gbit/s level
to academic backbone networks like GEANT and Internet 2 through a nordic
dark fibre network and of course inside Finland.<p>This system is owned by the finnish ministry of education
and operated on their behalf by CSC primarily for the Finnish Academic
and Research Network FUNET users. It is located in the town of Espoo
in Finland.<p>Paper mail address:

<p>INTRO:<p><pre><code>    This system has plenty of freely distributable material on its FTPable</code></pre>
areas.   We have also other services, see at the end of this document for
pointers.<p><pre><code>    If you have any questions regarding MATERIALS in this archive, read</code></pre>
first `Contacts about material in here' below.  If you can't locate correct
person/mail alias with it, try `problems@nic.funet.fi', but do not do that
as your only attempt!
<p>WHAT IS CONSIDERED A PROPER CONDUCT OF ANONYMOUS FTP USAGE:<p><pre><code>    Like many systems world wide, ours offers  anonymous  logins for</code></pre>
FTP users.  Such a service means:
	- You do not need to apply an account at this server, just use
	  well known userid:   anonymous  (or ftp)  and for a password please 
          do enter your email address (in format:  your_userid@your_site)
          according to the convention used since the 1970s in public FTP servers.<p>- While this service is called ""anonymous"" due to that well-known
	  userid, it is considered good manners to identify yourself
	  properly.  (No, this is not truly anonymous.)
	(See PRIVACY ISSUES)<p>For those who have this privilege of using ftp, here are some do's
and don'ts:<p><pre><code>      - When you are working over long distance links, do limit yourself
	to off hours.  When working between the USA and Finland, try it
	after 4 PM OUR time ( 10 AM Eastern USA time.)  And remember that
	we wake up 10 hours before California.
	We are at time zone  `UTC +2h' and in summer 'UTC +3h'

      - Major portion material in this archive originates from various
	locations all over USA.  Sometimes those locations are well
	known.  Often not.  We try to indicate origins if we know them.
	DO try to use server nearest (network wise) to yourself, USA
	folks: please restrain  yourself to USA.

      - When you log in anonymous, system immediately identifies you, and
	if you are not limited by number of users, you are
	prompted with:

	331 Any password will work

	We'd still appreciate you to give your email address as password.
	We might someday spot problems on files and send warnings to those who
	have requested that(/those) file(s) (see PRIVACY ISSUES).

	If your FTP program uses  getpass(3) routine blindly (mostly old
	BSD networking source derived FTP programs), you can't enter
	more than 8 characters for password from the keyboard.  Ever.
	Try to install FTP program from /pub/local/src/net2+mea-ftp.tar.Z.
	You can then feed in a lot longer `passwords'.
	(It has replacement for getpass() which inputs 130 chars.)

	Alternatively, read the man-page of ftp-program (assuming you
	are using UNIX ftp client), and see what is said about "".netrc"".

	Some machines have problems with @-characters at such addresses,
		UNIX:          stty erase ^? kill ^u
		IBM VM/SP CMS: CP TERM CHARDEL OFF,  CP TERM LINEND OFF

      - When you upload something, make sure it is freely distributable.
	For example some GIF images we have gotten are very obviously
	scanned from magazines, which have publication copyrights on them.
	This makes it illegal to copy those pictures `without the prior
	written consent of the publisher.' (And yes, WE WANT TO SEE THAT
	WRITTEN CONSENT FOR UPLOADING SUCH!)

      - See below more about what is `Freely Distributable'.
	After all, it is not always the same as Public Domain!

      - Don't do many parallel downloads, it will slow down the
	service for others and eventually even you. There's a maximum limit
        on simultaneous connections for FTP which is shown when you log in. 
        For HTTP we have had to limit the maximum connections from one
        IP to 10. 


      - REMEMBER: USING ANONYMOUS FTP IS A PRIVILEGE.  DON'T ABUSE IT!
</code></pre>
<p>PRIVACY ISSUES<p><pre><code>    All file accesses, logins etc. are logged, and the logs are kept</code></pre>
for indefinite period of time pending disk space availability (months online, 
years offline.) to satisfy statistical and legislative requirements.<p><pre><code>    If you want to be unidentifiable, that is entirely up to you, and</code></pre>
possible within rules of our server by using password of type:<p>inconnu@<your host identity><p>If you want to be totally unknown, you must not use FTP, as it can
never be used without revealing the IP address of your FTP client.
Even if you had a firewall or proxy somewhere in between, they often
keep track who's using them. In any case we don't collect email
addresses for spammers and we might use them only in exceptional cases
ourselves.  For statistics we use the domain part of your hostname,
not the hostname itself which in practice means organization and
country level statistics which we need to maintain the service and
it's funding. Please try to keep your reverse DNS working, especially
if you are under .fi domain since we will try to give preference to
finnish users in case we will someday again have to impose domain
based speed restrictions on the service like in the early days of the
Internet.<p><p>CONTACTS ABOUT MATERIAL IN HERE:<p>Example: An alias ""xyz-adm"" is to be addressed as
""xyz-adm@nic.funet.fi"", please don't use HTML email or something else
that might be interpreted as SPAM by our filters. Plain old english or
finnish text is the best!  Please note, that many of the old /pub
areas are not actively maintained and most of the content is actually
automatically updated from a master site which you should be able to
deduce from the /pub/mirrors/some.site/ directory path.<p>Alias 		Area   			Description

unwillingess to do the effort of publishing such a set.  Arranging the
publishing on this kind of directly government funded system is not so
easy in legal wise when it comes to direct money making as of selling
those CD-ROMs... Also it doesn't too well fit to our main business
idea of providing all the WAN network services the Academic and
Research community needs. The whole archive on CD-ROM would take 
thousands of CD-ROMs and require lots of manpower to figure out what
should or shouldn't be on each cd-rom and how to finance it. We are a
network service provider, not a cd-rom store.<p>Some software collections are available commercially, with technical
support, on CD-ROM from other sources (e.g. most Linux distributions). That
may even be a major revenue source for maintaining those collections
so they might not even allow cd-rom versions by others. Some other
collections however are specifically available as CD-ROM images (.iso)
that you can burn yourself and even distribute according to their
copyright statements. So please read the fine print before
redistributing collections available from us.<p>FTPD SOURCES:<p>For a simple to maintain ftp server, you might want to
look at www.pureftpd.org, we have used it successfully in several
different places.  Another Very Secure choice might be vsftpd
available from <a href=""http://vsftpd.beasts.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vsftpd.beasts.org</a> that is being used by many large
sites.<p><p>REPORTING A BUG:<p><pre><code>    If you observe odd behaviour of this server, which is not of what you</code></pre>
believe to be correct, please contact   problems@ftp.funet.fi  and in the
report have attached a session log which shows the wrong functionality.
However, check at first what we state about ""Restrictions"" below!<p>Such log should start from your FTP session startup, and it should contain:<p>- Descriptions about your (computing-) environment relevant

		  not come with builtin TCP/IP -- VMS-machines are one
		  such example.)
	- UNEDITED (verbose, unabridged) session transcript showing
	  EVERYTHING you sent to this system, and what were the responses.<p>Note: Reports about corrupted files belong to archive area keepers; they

<p>WHAT IS `FREELY DISTRIBUTABLE' ?<p>Freely distributable does not mean the same thing as PD
(public domain).  A big portion of the software available here is not
in the public domain, although it is freely distributable.  Many are
copyrighted by some person or organization, but can be distributed
freely; there may be limitations on the manner of distribution and/or
the usage of the programs.  There may also be certain rules concerning
the distribution of modified versions (derivate work) of the programs,
like saying that if you redistribute a modified version you must
include in the distribution the date and author of the modification.

=============================<p>1988 Finland gets it's first internet link of 56Kbit/s via the NORDUnet co-operation and major part of the traffic was from FTP
1989 Funet saw a need for a FTP-server that would allow better access to the internet content (web was still a dream)
     from Finland. Decision to set up NIC.FUNET.FI was made and Request for Proposals sent out
1990 First NIC.FUNET.FI, a SUN 4/330, with dual 40Mhz SPARC processors, 128MB RAM and 6GB of usable
     disk space which made it then among the largest FTP servers in the Internet. 
     Our international internet connectivity for whole Funet was 64Kbit/s so mea develops an ftpd with speed limits
     More hardware details are available in historical/First-NIC-Hardware.txt
1991 Linus Torvalds offered a small OS for public distribution which our volunteer 
     Ari Lemmke decided to call Linux and the name stuck... International connection was upgraded to 128Kbit/s
1992 We had about 20GB of external disks and a motherboard upgrade making it in practice a SUN 630-41 MP
     International connectivity was upgraded to 1Mbit/s
1994 Second NIC with 275Mhz Alpha processor, 320MB of memory and 100GB+ disk space (DEC AXP3000-900)
     International connection for Funet upgraded to 2 x 2Mbit/s
1999 Third NIC with four processors and 4GB of memory (a SUN 450) was taken in use. 
     Under 1TB made from well over hunred old and new disks in two RAID racks (DEC and Eurologic)
     International connections used 155Mbit/s links with redundancy
2003 A user survey to determine whether users still need NIC is made with an encouraging response
2006 The fourth version of NIC from Fujitsu-Siemens Computers with 16GB of memory and four processors
     is taken into production initially with 3TB+ EMC CX300 SAN storage array. A SUN V240 is in a support role.
     2.5Gbit/s and 10Gbit/s international links
2007 5-6 TB SAN storage added. Dark fibers with support for many lightpaths deployed in the Funet backbone.
2010 Fifth version of NIC, a Dell R710, with dual Quad-Core Nehalem EP (2,53Ghz Intel Xeon 5540) processors, 
     72GB of RAM and storage from the CSC storage area network (initially 10TB+ from a EMC CX700) 
     taken into use under Solaris 10 and the ZFS filesystem. Network connection is now 
     10Gbit/s to the Funet backbone and multiples of 10Gbit/s to the rest of the Internet.<p>More historical pieces of information can be found in various files around NIC and especially a more
generic Internet-history in a concise web format at <a href=""http://www.nic.funet.fi/index/FUNET/history/internet/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nic.funet.fi/index/FUNET/history/internet/</a><p>There's also a more verbose article of NIC now and then at the CSCnews 3/06 available at

Split keyboards help a lot.<p>However, in the last few years, I've had increasing difficulty with my neck and shoulders, one one side mostly. I am also an avid whitewater kayaker, and the first time my shoulder cried out in protest, I put it down to making some wrong moves while playboating. Physical therapy and a break from the water took care of it eventually. So naturally I stopped the exercises, and the shoulder pain came back with a vengeance the first time I was back on the water.<p>Now paying attention to my posture, and doing neck and shoulder stretches several times a day, is slowly improving my condition. So don't forget to not only support your wrists, but also to support your whole lower arm, either by sitting very close to the table or by having a decent ergonomic chair with adjustable arm rests. It prevents your shoulders from hunching up and developing all sorts of knots in your shoulder and back muscles. Your neck will thank you.",1313540318

As New Zealand is a welfare state, the university was paying near-full wages to these ineffective workers, and some of them didn't come back for months or years.<p>They hired a nurse just for RSI injuries. The first and most important rule was ""Muscles don't rebuild if you don't use them, so if they are hurting, you have to <i>use</i> them, not protect them."" Everyone had been putting their wrists into wrist supports (which is what you would do if it was a broken bone or broken skin), and the pain wouldn't go away because the wrists weren't active, and thus weren't healing.<p>Whenever I see someone wearing a wrist support, I bite my tongue and try not to tell them to get it off, as its making it worse.

My department does a lot of work in this area; drop me an email if you're interested and I can point you in the direction of some reading.<p>You are 100% correct that current AAC solutions are often suboptimal, but one of the big challenges facing the field is that individual capabilities (both in terms of cognitive function and motor control) vary <i>extremely</i> widely from user to user, and so there's no such thing as a ""one-size fits all"" solution. Oh, and head buttons like the one you saw typically use ""over-sized arcade buttons"" because the user doesn't have the fine motor control needed to operate anything smaller. The idea is to give them as big and easy a target to hit as possible. There are users who, literally, are limited to twitching one of their eyebrows as their sole voluntary muscle motion, and sometimes even that is unreliable (i.e., it only twitches some of the time, or for a short period of time). In such a case, you want the button to be as easy as possible to trigger- think Fitt's law. :-)<p>Accelerometer-based solutions such as the one described in the article have the potential to be extremely useful; however, in the case of a user who's limited to a head button (or an elbow button, a nose switch, etc. etc.), the physical movements involved could well be too variable and irregular to be usefully decoded. That said, one of the active areas of research within the AAC world is how to build machine learning algorithms into AAC software such that an individual's system adapts over time to their patterns of use, so depending on what's going on with a particular user it might be possible to train something up... but, of course, doing this in any kind of repeatable way often ends up to be a crapshoot, as, again, users vary incredibly widely in terms of which muscles they can control and the extent to which they can do so.",1313539966

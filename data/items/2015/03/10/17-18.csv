If you name methods and variables with lengthy but very descriptive names your tests can still be readable. In fact the more you modularize your setup methods the more readable they can become. For example:<p>TestData.CreatePerson();<p>TestData.AddSsnToPerson();<p>TestData.PersonModule.checkWhetherPersonHasValidSsn();<p>...is pretty readable despite being broken up. It may or may not be true that if you just went through the setup here it may be more readable, but the benefit to this approach is that you only have to write a method to add an SSN to a person object one time and then everyone can use it without needing to understand the structure of different objects. Notwithstanding readability, I would argue that DRY makes <i>writing</i> tests easier than cramming a bunch of setters into every test case. Once somebody understands what a setup method does, in every place that it is used in other tests the tester can skip over that part and move on to testing their specific use case.",1426010382

9179363,comment,9178784,9179120,0,0,reasonattlm,,,"The science is promising and moving rapidly. This was announced just yesterday for example:<p><a href=""http://www.scripps.edu/news/press/2015/20150309agingcell.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scripps.edu/news/press/2015/20150309agingcell.htm...</a><p>One of the first mainstream groups to pick up and run with one of the SENS repair based therapies, senescent cell clearance here, and already just by mining existing drugs - something that should be marginal at best - they are showing more benefits in normal old mice than has been generated in the past decade of messing with sirtuins and so forth. Repair of damage is clearly the way to go.<p>----------<p>The scientists coined the term &quot;senolytics&quot; for the new class of drugs. &quot;We view this study as a big, first step toward developing treatments that can be given safely to patients to extend healthspan or to treat age-related diseases and disorders. When senolytic agents, like the combination we identified, are used clinically, the results could be transformative. The prototypes of these senolytic agents have more than proven their ability to alleviate multiple characteristics associated with aging. It may eventually become feasible to delay, prevent, alleviate or even reverse multiple chronic diseases and disabilities as a group, instead of just one at a time.&quot;<p>Senescent cells - cells that have stopped dividing - accumulate with age and accelerate the aging process. Since the &quot;healthspan&quot; (time free of disease) in mice is enhanced by killing off these cells, the scientists reasoned that finding treatments that accomplish this in humans could have tremendous potential. The scientists were faced with the question, though, of how to identify and target senescent cells without damaging other cells. The team suspected that senescent cells&#x27; resistance to death by stress and damage could provide a clue. Indeed, using transcript analysis, the researchers found that, like cancer cells, senescent cells have increased expression of &quot;pro-survival networks&quot; that help them resist apoptosis or programmed cell death. This finding provided key criteria to search for potential drug candidates.<p>Using these criteria, the team homed in on two available compounds - the cancer drug dasatinib and quercetin, a natural compound sold as a supplement that acts as an antihistamine and anti-inflammatory. Dasatinib eliminated senescent human fat cell progenitors, while quercetin was more effective against senescent human endothelial cells and mouse bone marrow stem cells. A combination of the two was most effective overall.<p>Next, the team looked at how these drugs affected health and aging in mice. &quot;In animal models, the compounds improved cardiovascular function and exercise endurance, reduced osteoporosis and frailty, and extended healthspan. Remarkably, in some cases, these drugs did so with only a single course of treatment.&quot; In old mice, cardiovascular function was improved within five days of a single dose of the drugs. A single dose of a combination of the drugs led to improved exercise capacity in animals weakened by radiation therapy used for cancer. The effect lasted for at least seven months following treatment with the drugs. Periodic drug administration of mice with accelerated aging extended the healthspan in the animals, delaying age-related symptoms, spine degeneration and osteoporosis.<p>The authors caution that more testing is needed before use in humans. They also note both drugs in the study have possible side effects, at least with long-term treatment. The researchers, however, remain upbeat about their findings&#x27; potential. &quot;Senescence is involved in a number of diseases and pathologies so there could be any number of applications for these and similar compounds. Also, we anticipate that treatment with senolytic drugs to clear damaged cells would be infrequent, reducing the chance of side effects.&quot;",1426010277

9179334,comment,9176586,9177563,0,0,rayiner,,,"> 1) How are broad secret court[4] and non-court[5] orders constitutional?<p>There are two broad concepts these rest on.<p>First, is that many of the NSA&#x27;s activities do not require court oversight in the first place, because they rest on the executive&#x27;s broad powers in foreign affairs. By and large, the Constitution does not apply on foreign soil, and so the NSA does not need a court order to spy on e.g. Angela Merkel. The crucial thing to understand about the FISA Court is that it&#x27;s not an attempt to take something that previously required a warrant from a regular court and make it a secret proceeding. That would be unconstitutional. Instead, its an attempt to take a process that Constitutionally requires <i>no court oversight</i> and inject some court oversight to ensure that the NSA stays within its foreign mission.<p>The second broad principle is Smith v. Maryland plus the broad subpoena power. Smith v. Maryland says that information you put in the hands of a third party is not protected by the 4th amendment. The subpoena power says that you can always be compelled to turn over information pursuant to a valid investigation. The subpoena power is very old. It predates the Constitution by hundreds of years.<p>The anti-NSA side generally misunderstands the context of the 4th and 5th amendments. The background rule is that the government is entitled to evidence relevant to an investigation. Heck, even private litigants are so entitled. If you&#x27;re suing a company, you can serve a subpoena on a third party obligating them to turn over documents relevant to the lawsuit. The 4th and 5th amendments are <i>exceptions</i> to those broad powers. And in an age where everyone&#x27;s information is floating around in the &quot;cloud&quot; where third parties have access to it, Smith v. Maryland gives the NSA a very wide latitude in which they can operate and still in good faith say their programs are legal.",1426010138

9179332,comment,9178117,9178566,0,0,mrb,,,"Yes there is a solution. The reason it took you days to resync was because you ran the reference implementation, Bitcoin Core, which is meant for &quot;full nodes&quot; running 24/7. Simple users like you should instead run &quot;thin client&quot; or SPV wallets (Simple Payment Verification) which do not need to store the whole block chain, allowing your wallet to resync pretty much instantly. For a list of SPV wallets see <a href=""https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet</a> and look for those labelled &quot;simplified validation&quot;.<p>You also very likely ran into the problem that older versions of Bitcoin Core were slow to download blocks. For example version 0.10.0 released in February 2015 introduces parallel block download, which makes resyncing faster. Numerous other optimizations were made over the last 12-24 months (eg. better detection of stalled downloads). From your description it sounds like you were running a significantly older version of Bitcoin Core, so you were missing out on all these optimizations.<p>I would like to point out that despite the block chain growing continuously, we are still <i>very far</i> from the point where only large service providers can hold the block chain. The average block size is currently ~400 kB (<a href=""https://blockchain.info/charts/avg-block-size?showDataPoints=false&timespan=&show_header=true&daysAverageString=7&scale=0&address="" rel=""nofollow"">https://blockchain.info/charts/avg-block-size?showDataPoints...</a>), this means the block chain grows by ~20 GB every year. This is only 1% the size of an average desktop hard drive (2 TB), and would take only 4.5 hours to download (once a year, mind you) assuming a steady common residential Internet download speed of 10 Mbit/s.<p>Heck, a dedicated computer on a common residential Internet connection could still run as a full node and handle an average block size 100x larger that today (~40 MB per block, 2 TB growth per year = 0.5 Mbit/s continuous download). I would hardly describe something an enthusiast can do as a thing that &quot;only large service providers can do&quot;. And keep in mind by the time 100x growths happens, CPUs/HDDs/Internet speeds will be much faster than today. Bitcoin&#x27;s scalability has already been benchmarked pretty well: <a href=""https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Scalability"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Scalability</a> - no immediate bottlenecks are in sight.<p><i>&quot;high fees in its transactions&quot;</i><p>Fees are optional, and typically 0.0001 BTC (3 cents).<p><i>&quot;up to 15 minutes for the transaction to be approved&quot;</i><p>No, transactions are typically &quot;received&quot; instantly within seconds, and take 10-60 minutes on average to &quot;settle&quot; (be confirmed by 1 to 6 blocks). This is a lot faster than credit cards or ACH which both take 24h (or more if this is a weekend) to be received (ie. dollars available in the recipient&#x27;s account), or bank wires which take days (or end-of-business-day if your are lucky).",1426010098

I am fine with ping-pong tables and beer on tap, if they come with professionalism, where professionalism includes things like not sexually harassing women. Alcohol especially needs to be handled with care, and encouraging employees to have more than one drink is downright irresponsible. My point was that there is a contingent of business-types whose gameplan is to use the fun stuff as an excuse to drop professionalism, as in, why should you ask for a raise when you&#x27;re having so much fun here? It&#x27;s one big party!<p>The reason I say this is that I was recently job interviewing and I had one company that acted like this, and even brought me into a Friday happy hour as part of the interview process, where a bunch of young males were playing beer pong. First of all, how is that not a hostile environment for a woman? Secondly, I didn&#x27;t want to drink, so was I supposed to look like I was no fun or bend my principles? Finally, when I complained to the recruiter, I was told they _only_ did that for engineers, and it was clear to me that it was a general strategy of indoctrination to avoid paying market rate, because it was all fun and games until we started talking compensation. And the company I most recently worked with before was more or less the same, the startup industry is filled with companies exactly like this.<p>We have a culture of brogrammers because the VCs create it to avoid paying engineers.

Understanding that is key to understanding the conservative optimizations that some people recommend, if you are too aggressive with how you treat the GC and memory pressure you program might fall apart when influenced by a different GC implementation. Correct GC treatment results in a program that executes well under any GC implementation - including a concurrent GC. There are probably some programs already out there that rely too heavily on the current Go GC and they will likely need to re-align with the new GC implementation.

You create a window, set the window size, adjust the sort order, set some filter and so on – and then you can visit any number of folders with those view settings applied. Another window can offer a different view of the same folder at the same time. This is the &quot;browser&quot; approach.<p>In the classic Finder, and in the OS/2 Workplace Shell, the view properties are associated with the folder. A folder can only be open in one window – the window <i>is</i> the folder. Other folders open in other windows. Any particular folder will always open its window in the same position and the same size (and in OS/2 have the same window background and various other properties).

As much as there have been a lot of false-starts related to trying to reinvent SQL, I think Entity Framework hits many of the right notes for me:<p>1) All my code lives in Visual Studio with compile-time type-checking.  No maintaining stored procedures outside of my main codebase, no mucking about with strings.  And because Entity Framework puts the Select <i>after</i> the From clause, I even get good intellisense on column-names.<p>2) I can quickly shift code into being in-memory queries from database queries.<p>3) While it&#x27;s a little muddy mixing SQL and C#, there are places where C#/EF&#x27;s syntax is so much more brief and clean since it&#x27;s hyper-aware of relationships.  For example, instead of writing 2 joins to get the country of a user, I can say User.Centre.Country.<p>Of course, the Entity Framework is adding a layer of complexity to my work - you still have to know what&#x27;s going on in SQL, and that mental overhead is a downside.

Most languages are procedural to some degree, but C is entirely sequential. Digital hardware, unlike a C program, is entirely concurrent. When you write HDL for hardware, you&#x27;re not really writing a program, you&#x27;re <i>describing</i> the hardware layout itself. Really it&#x27;s closer to making a logic gate or circuit diagram.  HDL doesn&#x27;t &quot;run&quot; like a software program. It just exists on the FPGA. That&#x27;s the design, and it doesn&#x27;t change once it&#x27;s programmed on the chip. As such, the only &quot;procedures&quot; in hardware are from causality from something that happened in the past in the same hardware, either from a different part of the circuit, or the same part in a clocked design.<p>So what would be a good tool to describe hardware? I think (preferably immutable state) functional languages would be much closer, because they&#x27;re much less procedural. You can more directly describe complex logic that takes some input, and gives some output, in a manner such that sequence of events does not matter. This would be much more powerful when mapped to an FPGA, because everything that didn&#x27;t rely on a previous result could happen at the exact same time. And THAT much better utilizes the power of hardware. Implementing a long chain of sequential events on hardware is... not the smartest way to design hardware.",1426008845

An EB-2 or EB-3 confers permanent residency status, which means you can do whatever you want. Start a new company, be unemployed, apply for citizenship, etc. You enjoy the same rights as citizens in almost every regard except voting (and running for office).<p>A correction though: the EB-2 (and any employment-based green card) takes about 21 months or more to process right now. So a company is looking at a circa 2+ years processing time. Because of how complex, expensive, difficult, and time-consuming the process is, I don&#x27;t know if a lot of employers would use it to bring someone over to the US.<p>In nearly 99% cases, companies bring people over on an H-1 or L-1, and then over a period of 2-3 years (or more) help them transition to permanent residency (via EB-2 or EB-3) if they really like the person (i.e. you&#x27;re performance is excellent, etc).<p>Unfortunately it&#x27;s really really hard[1] to immigrate to the US. Most people do <i>not</i> realize how hard it is. The &quot;easiest&quot; route unfortunately, is to interview with companies that are willing to apply for an H-1B, and then take your chances at the annual lottery. You&#x27;ll have to find a job with a company willing to sponsor by mid-March in order to be able to have a shot at coming to the US that year in October.<p>[1] Recently a bipartisan group of senator published a document that lays out a framework for immigrition reform. In it, they acknowledge: &quot;Our failure to act is perpetuating a broken system which sadly discourages the world’s best and brightest citizens from coming to the United States and remaining in our country to contribute to our economy. This failure makes a legal path to entry in the United States <i>insurmountably difficult for well meaning immigrants</i>.&quot; (see: <a href=""http://www.flake.senate.gov/documents/immigration_reform.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.flake.senate.gov/documents/immigration_reform.pdf</a> – page 3) The phrase &quot;<i>insurmountably difficult</i>&quot; describes very well the status quo of the U.S. immigration system.",1426008678

The title says <i>concurrent</i> GC, which is, unfortunately, usually a misnomer in GC literature - it usually means that parts of the GC are concurrent with the mutator (user program), but that there are still synchronization points where pausing the mutator is required. If GC that is <i>actually</i> concurrent 100% of the time, <i>fully</i>-concurrent or <i>on-the-fly</i> label (edit: and <i>pauseless</i> as well, as <i>bradleyjg</i> mentioned) is used.<p>Second, while it&#x27;s not that hard to implement a mostly-concurrent GC, it&#x27;s practically impossible to implement an efficient compacting, on-the-fly GC, as it would require read barriers during the compaction phase, which would significantly slow down the program. Azul makes such a GC, but they use privileged (kernel) code to implement read barrier (mutator threads still need to be paused/sychronized with, but not all at the same time) (edit2: Azul&#x27;s C4 collector doesn&#x27;t use a kernel read barrier, and apparently their read barrier is much more efficient than most). I don&#x27;t know if Go features a compacting GC (although many languages do, as that&#x27;s the only thing that can prevent unbounded heap growth over time), but if it does, it&#x27;s almost certainly not on-the-fly GC.<p>To summarize, I assume this will only reduce the pauses, not eliminate them.",1426008181

You have to keep your entire dataset in RAM, but that&#x27;s not always necessary. My favorite example is from Foursquare. They had every single check-in ever in MongoDB in RAM. That&#x27;s absolutely unnecessary, and quite silly to do so. Old check-ins are archived data. You don&#x27;t need them. No user ever wants to know when/where they checked in three years ago. This is why at the time they were paying for 68 GB RAM Amazon boxes instead of 4-8 GB boxes. (I have no idea what they do now. I remember chatting with them on HN after a catastrophic out of memory failure when they filled up the entire 68 GB&#x27;s).",1426007941

9178986,comment,9178543,9178843,0,0,Buttons840,,,"> The goal of the Go 1.5 (June 2015) Garbage Collector (GC) is to reduce GC latency, making Go acceptable for implementing a broad spectrum of systems requiring low response times.  Quantitatively this means that for adequately provisioned machines limiting GC latency to less than 10 milliseconds (10ms), with mutator (Go application code) availability of more than 40 ms out of every 50 ms. Hardware provisioning should allow for in-memory heap sizes twice as large as reachable memory and 25% of CPU cycles, typically one out of 4 hardware threads, available for GC tasks. These goals align with a future with ever-increasing numbers of hardware threads and an ever-increasing amount of memory, all within an ever-decreasing power and expense budget.\n>Tactically, we will use a hybrid stop the world (STW) / concurrent garbage collector (CGC). The STW piece will limit the amount of time goroutines are stopped to less than 10 milliseconds out of every 50 milliseconds. If the GC completes a cycle in this time frame, great. If not, the GC will transition into a concurrent GC for the remainder of the 50 millisecond block. This process will repeat until the GC cycle completes. As a practical matter if one has a 50 millisecond response quality of service (QOS) requirement one should expect to have 40 milliseconds in which to do mutator tasks. These numbers assume hardware equivalent to a generic $1000 desktop box running Linux.<p>Source: <a href=""http://llvm.cc/t/go-1-4-garbage-collection-plan-and-roadmap-golang-org/33"" rel=""nofollow"">http://llvm.cc/t/go-1-4-garbage-collection-plan-and-roadmap-...</a><p>It appears the answer to your question is no. My interpretation of the above is that, like other garbage collectors (Haskell&#x27;s comes to mind, I don&#x27;t know much about other GCs), some garbage collection will be able to happen concurrently with no pausing, but some collection will still require &quot;stop the world&quot; pauses. Go&#x27;s goal to limit those stop the world pauses to 10 ms is not something I have seen in many other garbage collectors. The only other garbage collector I&#x27;ve encountered with a similar feature is Nim&#x27;s garbage collector which claims to allow a limit on how long each garage collection pass will take, similar to what Go is trying to do.<p>I wonder if Go want this 10 ms limit to be a hard or soft limit?<p>* Take all I say about garbage collectors with a grain of salt. I have had some interest in their various features, but am no expert.",1426007879

If you can express your code&#x27;s spec in a test, then you have a much higher chance of deeply understanding your design... hence the article&#x27;s recommendation that you first know what you are doing before diving into writing tests.<p>As for tests in the larger practical sense vs. the trivial... The vast majority of large systems are compositions of small, seemingly trivial pieces. A large system&#x27;s code needs to be organized so that all its component pieces/concerns are comprehensible and separate; otherwise, it&#x27;s an unmaintainable monolithic soup.

You can&#x27;t just compile any arbitrary piece of software to hardware.  At least not directly...not without an implied runtime package to support your program on hardware.

Dunno. He presents several graphs of daily mileage, is that evidence for or against usage of treadmill desks? Dunno. The calorie count is small (compared to what?) when he calculates out, does that mean treadmill desks are not helpful? Dunno.<p>More relevant would be stuff like: how many emails did he send each day correlated against mileage? How many words did he write in his novel, or how many words did he edit? Did he at least lose some weight? Was his mood better on treadmill days? Did he consider running a simple randomized test (just flip a coin for each day whether to use a treadmill) for anything? Heck, what was his subjective experience, even, about the effects of treadmill - did he feel unable, as many people do (not just you), to do anything requiring real concentration?<p>OP reminds me a lot of Stephen Wolfram&#x27;s big fancy QS post about metrics like typing: he had measured an impressive number of things, but nothing that ever mattered.",1426007034

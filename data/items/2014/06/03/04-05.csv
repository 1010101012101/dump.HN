We all here look at each other in disbelief (figuratively). Yes someone granted the the trademark thinking this is valid thing to do.<p>I guess, thinking about it. No matter how indignant I would get about this topic, I really don&#x27;t see myself dropping programming and applying to the Patent Office.<p>It seems to me this is not completely unlike the case of primary education in US. I have heard and seen horror stories about utter incompetence of math and science teachers in some schools. I get angry and indignant about it. But, in the morning, I will go back to programming. I will not be applying for a teaching certificate or whatever the first step is to become a teacher.<p>Painting with broad strokes here, it seem, this is the work non-experts doing experts&#x27; work. The tragedy is there are anti-incentives to attracting passionate or driven individuals in such positions. Bureaucracy, low pay, perceived cultural low status of the jobs, is probably the driving force behinds these kind of things.",1401771500

7838208,comment,7837389,7838136,4,0,kennywinker,,,"Method parameter names are used similarly in Swift as in ObjC. For example two methods can have the same name, as long as they have a difference set of parameters. For example:<p><pre><code>    func methodName(paramName: String)\n</code></pre>\nand<p><pre><code>    func methodName(paramName: String, otherParam: Int)\n</code></pre>\nare different.<p>I&#x27;m still playing with this but there are some interesting/weird things in here. What follows is a bunch of random observations of how named params work in Swift / ObjC. For instance:<p><pre><code>    func methodName(name name: String)\n</code></pre>\nCan be shortened using a pound symbol, because the variable name within the method, and the parameter name are the same thing:<p><pre><code>    func methodName(#name: String)\n</code></pre>\nIt also seems that most of the Cocoa APIs follow a convention, when called from Swift, of having an unnamed first parameter, and a named second parameter. e.g. this:<p><pre><code>    -(UITableViewCell *)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView cellForRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath\n</code></pre>\nbecomes:<p><pre><code>    func tableView(tableView: UITableView!, cellForRowAtIndexPath indexPath: NSIndexPath!) -> UITableViewCell!\n</code></pre>\nwhich means it&#x27;s called like so:<p><pre><code>    myObject.tableView(tableView, cellForRowAtIndexPath: indexPath)\n</code></pre>\nIf you name a parameter, you have to use the name. The order of parameters matters, and there doesn&#x27;t seem to be a way to define optional method parameters (make sense as parameter names are essentially ObjC &quot;selectors&quot;).",1401770922

7838198,comment,7835925,7837894,1,0,coherentpony,,,">Suppose we&#x27;re flipping a fair coin. We should expect to see roughly equal numbers of heads and tails. If I flip the same coin a thousand times and see 523 heads, that seems &quot;reasonable&quot;. It&#x27;s certainly possible to get 873 heads, but I might start to wonder if the coin is really fair not because it&#x27;s very unlikely to get 873 heads with a fair coin (and it is very unlikely) but because it&#x27;s more plausible that the coin is biased.<p>The first sentence said the coin was fair.  Given that the coin is fair, flipping 873 heads in a thousand tosses is perfectly fine, it just has a smaller probability than flipping 523 heads (as you have already clearly stated).<p>Believing that the coin is biased is nothing more than human scepticism because we were told the coin was fair.  Given that the coin is biased, you are right to state that the probability is higher.  Probability is about working with given information, not about being suspicious about given information.  If you had a reason to believe the coin wasn&#x27;t fair, it being fair would not be part of the information given.  The point I&#x27;m making here is that it is easy to mislead someone.  You told me the coin was fair.  If you then cheat and flip a biased coin there is no way for me tell if the coin is biased because it is my belief the coin is fair.<p><i>Prior information doesn&#x27;t change after you look at the data.  The distribution taking into account observations is different, and it is called the posterior distribution.</i><p>You have essentially taken my statement:<p><i>What you&#x27;re describing is a rare event. Rare events happen, just rarely.</i><p>and repeated exactly my argument back to me.<p>Given that the hurricane gender is assigned uniformly at random, it is fine to observe that female hurricanes are more deadly.  <i>Quite a bit more deadly</i> is nothing more than random chance.  Remember, the prior was that they were assigned uniformly at random.<p>It could be the case that people assign names to hurricanes based on behaviour, path, time of year, or whatever other characteristic you like (and perhaps this is done subconsciously).  In this case, the prior belief is that they are no longer assigned uniformly at random, but a human assigns them genders correlated with some physical quantity.  Now, is it surprising that female hurricanes are more deadly?  Perhaps not.",1401770713

While you may disagree that they should not be allowed to have such a trademark, it is the name of their company, and they have to enforce the trademark if they want to keep it. Because this is a trademark, they have to prove that someone else is trying to pass off a product as one of their own in order to take punitive action against the opposing party. What this means in practice is that if someone uses the pi symbol in a paper or on the internet, it&#x27;s likely not to be confused with the t-shirts they are selling, so therefore there is no trademark infringement. However, if you&#x27;re selling t-shirts that have a pi symbol on it in a similar fashion, you&#x27;re opening yourself for litigation. It is also important that they take action against companies that are infringing on their trademark lest they lose the trademark (which also happens to be in their company name).<p>In any case, this is just a silly story and has nothing at all to do with patents, and nobody should be worried unless you plan on making and selling t-shirts with a pi symbol on the front of them.",1401769946

Plus, there were a ton of small refinements that I got used to very quickly.<p>I didn&#x27;t notice how quickly until I switched back to a Snow Leopard install I maintain for Final Cut Studio (don&#x27;t get me started on FCP X). All of a sudden the old OS felt...outdated. Totally reliable, sure. But not quite as friendly.<p>One unexpected change is that Safari has become my favorite browser. Its integration with the OS and iOS, plus the integration of iOS and OS X gave it an edge that Chrome and FF can&#x27;t match. Judging from what was revealed today, it&#x27;s looks like that kind of seamless transition between devices is what we can expect a lot more of.",1401769681

The reason you have to shift down when climbing a hill is to get the engine into a higher rev-range (compared to the wheels) than it currently is.  With Nascar engines it may be that they are able to make a flat torque curve - probably because of the RPM restrictions.   Most non-turbo passenger cars will make maximum torque in the mid-high end of their engine speed.  Turbo/super charging assists in boosting torque output at lower engine RPM than in normally aspirated engines.  The torque characteristics are a property of the bore/stroke relationship and the intake and exhaust tuning, as well as the camshaft timing.  The reason we now have variable length intake manifolds and variable valve timing and lift on engines is to maintain the peak power operating combined with better torque at lower speeds, which aids drivability overall.<p>Electric engines make maximum torque at 0 rpm, which is why most locomotives are diesel-electric, because the electric engine can make maximum RPM at standstil, while the diesel engines can be operated at higher RPM to create the most power.",1401768691

Swift is an apple invention and I would predict that they have no intention of releasing source code of it for availability on other platforms.  Apple is a very closed ecosystem.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objective-C#Popularization_through_NeXT"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objective-C#Popularization_thro...</a>",1401768583

Stockfish effectively discards probably 95% or more of the nodes in any position. Easier said than done, better not discard the best move in that 95%. Evaluation is relatively simple, a fancy lookup table. They say love covers a multitude of sins. Well, searching one move deeper than your opponent covers a multitude of static positional evaluation mistakes. Searching deeper can figure out the complexity of the position better than anything that can be statically evaluated. That&#x27;s where virtually all improvements exist today, figuring out which moves can be safely discarded.",1401768084

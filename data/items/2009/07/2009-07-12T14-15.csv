Integrate with major IM services, AIM, Jabber etc, and have your own ""Say Hi service"" in there for LBS chat.<p>2. Put something around the app, as in make it do more than just chat. Explore making it a dating app, so that you can chat/""quick date""/""lunch date"" people around you that are signed up with your service.  Companies like match.com etc have just stopped innovating in this space and you may be able to get traction.<p>I haven't done the research to see who else is doing this but it seems like for your app these two things look like an obvious steps.",1247410654

700196,comment,700143,700143,0,0,jv2222,,,"These kind of sites were invented in the UK a few years ago. The idea is based on a practice where con artists set up similar kind of ""auctions"" in the real world (mainly in unused shops on London's Oxford street).<p>The hook is that as you walk past the shop you see that you have the chance to get a play station for $1. So, you and about 100 other people pay $1 with the hope of getting a play station. After everyone's put their money in then they ""randomly"" select 5 people in the audience and hand over the play station to them.<p>Of course after the show, the audience ""plants"" secretly give the play stations back. So, in essence they keep recycling the same play stations all day long and real punters keep paying $1 and not getting anything.",1247410389

Heck, if I could write a great post every time I went to bat I'd be a famous author and not a consultant. I just enjoy writing. But I think there is a bit of self-censorship that goes on at HN with submissions and comments that I don't see elsewhere. I'm perfectly happy with folks submitting everything they write. I just think when we start flooding the net with HN submit buttons we're really stressing out the filtering mechanism past it's design limit. We've already reached the point where you have an hour or less to catch articles on the new tab before they roll off to page two. If folks are going to have to go digging through several pages of new articles everytime they visit it's going to be a turn-off, I'd think. (Although it might grow the site, which means that there is always going to be trade-off between culture and volume around here -- but I digress)<p>So I'm not crazy about the button.

(If you are your future employer, this should be over really freaking quick.)  Your situation will be your situation, regardless of what the average turns out to be.<p>I'm hardly a model of work/life balance (Japanese salaryman, hooo) but it was one of the big questions at my job interview.  I asked ""What time do my peers go home at this company?"", and after some hemming and hawing the bosses told me ""About nineish, usually.""  (9 to 9 x 5 = 60 hours, plus a 10 hour fudge factor because I did not fall off the turnip truck yesterday and know what ""usually"" means.)<p>So I told them ""There is a gap between what you expect as normal hours and what I expect as normal hours.  I think that there is a workable arrangement for both sides between our two numbers.  Will that be acceptable?""<p>They indicated that they valued my skillset a little more than slavish adherence to the company average schedule, and we've played give-and-take for the last two years.  I work more than I would like to if I had my druthers, but not so much that I'm <i>constantly</i> miserable about it.<p>Incidentally, I am bootstrapping a startup in similar circumstances to yourself regarding ""nights and weekends after long hours at the day job"", and I have one bit of advice: be totally ruthless about using your time efficiently and if at any time you feel that you can't, clock out for the day and go enjoy life.",1247410122

Their model has absolutely nothing intrinsically auction-like about it -- take a look at their ""auctions"" for CASH in which the putative ""bid price"" will never actually be paid by anyone.

Devil's advocate will say that the accelerations you submitted your imaginary passengers were way too strong.<p>My story in that vein was in PE: we were to run 20 minutes at the most constant pace to practice our endurance. The grade was taking into account the regularity of your pace (13 points out of 20 if you hit the exact same time for all but the fastest and slowest laps) as well as your average speed (the remaining 7 points).<p>Not being the most athletic guys, a friend and I went on our way to run 4 laps of exactly 5 minutes to insure a decent 13 out of 20, where a lap should have been in the 30-45s range.

When people ask us who our competitors are, we respond with 'paper cards'. The only we we will solve the business card problem is by playing well with these paper cards.<p>What you see on E today is the basic system we've designed to handle contact information with an additional visual layer. Features to handle paper cards - and mimic paper cards for that matter are things we're working on passionately. We know what it feels like to get a great looking business card, with a nice choice of paper, excellent typography, etc. But I'm convinced in time we will find an equally attractive solution - though it will not be overnight. The transitions from vinyl to cd to mp3, or printed books to ebooks have also take years.<p>Our added benefits however (stored geolocation of meetings, synched notes, etc.) are features we're getting great feedback on.",1294948485

One of the keys is that the users you are interested in actually participate in the different sites differently and have different followers and friends on those sites.

The majority of the world hasn't. My mom, for example, would search for ""how to bake apple pie"", rather than ""apple pie baking"" or any other such set of key terms.<p>In fact, your approach reminds me of the approach that I used with AltaVista (back when it was the premier search engine). The reason I used this approach is because I was taught to do this by one of my teachers. Back then, it was recognized that search engines don't recognize human language and that search queries had to be carefully crafted to return optimal results.<p>Of course, very few people think about that now. No one spends time crafting a search query - they just type their question into the Google box and click search. As Google search results decline in quality we might see a resurrection of the old way of thinking about and crafting search queries to return the optimal result set.",1294948043

But it's a retail job and the rewards are meager, so there's little incentive to become this ideal bookstore employee, though they do exist; the employee you do end up with is either a thwarted English major who despises you (this was once me, I'm sorry to say) or the avid reader of bestsellers -- and if that's not a good fit for you, too bad.<p>The achievement of Amazon is that they've actually done a decent job of automating what an ideal generalist bookseller does.<p>(Specialty bookstores are another story.

That is to say, it was a standard designed by a range of domain experts from across the industry, working to the remit of a standards organization. In fact, two standards organizations were involved: ISO and ITU. The specification was devised collaboratively, with its final ratification dependent on the agreement of the individuals, corporations, and national standards bodies that variously make up ISO and ITU. This makes H.264 an open standard in the same way as, for example, JPEG still images, or the C++ programming language, or the ISO 9660 filesystem used on CD-ROMs. H.264 is unambiguously open.</i><p>> <i>In contrast, neither WebM's VP8 nor Theora were assembled by a standards body such as ISO.

Replying to messages with complexity beyond ""A/S/L??"", I find that replies tend to depend on each other and if you try to quote, or selectively quote, parts of a message and reply to each section, your reply ends up having forward and backward dependencies, splitting up important points between different block quotes, and repeating itself. This is especially true when you have to introduce new information the other person wasn't aware, or if you need to explain your reasoning, or depart from their expected answer format. In short, any time your reply contains anything additional beyond direct answers to the questions. In the real world, most answers entail such additional information.<p>I know we value each and every precious keystroke, but I tend to stick with that old adage we learned in middle-school of restating the question in your answer. Since you're re-establishing the email context in your own words rather than using the words & order the other person gave you, you have the freedom to structure your reply that best communicates whatever it is you need to add.<p>My experience is that interleaved replied are also less concise. Re-stating context allows you to summarize it, and it allows you to unify several points into one response. Interleaved replies encourage repetition--I can't tell you how many debates I've seen with point-by-point rebuttals, where the last N-1 chunks all start with ""Again,"" ""As I said before,"" and ""Like I just said.""<p>To use the example from the original article: Best reply would be ""Thursday sounds great!""

Upgraded to a Psion 5 - great, but by then the market had become a bubble and burst, and Psion quickly vanished with the remaining issues with the platform sadly unsolved. Too many people had realised that a GBP400 handheld with slow data entry wasn't all that useful, there was a glut of inventory and the devices died.<p>Along came netbooks - brilliant! Battery life and portability not as good as before but software compatibility better. Then they became The Next Big Thing and everyone started making them, most people discovered that a 9"" laptop with no CD drive isn't very useful for them, and we've got a glut of inventory and a rapidly collapsing market.<p>Now we have tablets. For twice the cost of my netbook I can get an iPad which trades marginally greater portability and battery life for enormously worse data entry and more limited software.

My business card (I'm a business coach with Shirlaws) has a picture of a baby on it - it's not what people expect, it prompts a question, and it makes it more memorable. If they meet 20 people at a dinner, they won't remember them all - my card helps.

The starting point for their business (disclaimer - I've worked with them) is understanding communication styles, since each of us is a combination of Thinking, Feeling, and Knowing - usually with a predominance of one style over the others. The different styles are linked to decision making, as well as marketing tools like shapes and colours.<p>Ask one of their team for a business card, and they will produce a handful, <i>turn them over</i> to show you a group of cards that are blue, red, and green on the back, and <i>ask you to choose one</i>. The contact information on the front is the same; better believe that when you are forced to select one colour, the next question out of your mouth is 'what does that mean?', and the answer will explain their business and how they might be able to help your organisation.

586539,comment,585818,586472,0,0,bdash,,,"Your post itself was entirely fair, and the improvements to the profiler were great.  It is only the title of this posting that I take issue with.  If the title had been ""280 North makes WebKit's JavaScript Profiler Useful!"" I don't think it would be any less dramatic and would have been a lot less contentious.  It can be a little irksome knowing that someone put a huge amount of work into the profiling infrastructure in JavaScriptCore and the UI in the web inspector while the title, and the dozens of tweets it spawned, imply that is all 280 North's doing.<p>We're all better off if we focus on doing great things and set the sensationalism aside.  Thanks again for the contributions to WebKit, and I hope there are more going forwards!",1241077987

They had to rely on IBM and Motorola to do the actual chip design, while Apple focussed on creating the software for these chips. IBM and Motorola started to lose interest in promoting PowerPC in anything but the embedded space and server markets.<p>This time around, Apple has brought all the talent they need to do all of the design in-house.

If swine flu chills out and remains as is, everything will indeed be ok.  If it mutates and gets worse, we are so screwed.<p>The danger is that there is a rapidly spreading flu strain that is much more likely than normal to rapidly increase its mortality rate.<p>So... fingers crossed.  We should be ok.  If not, there's not much anyone can do about it.",1241077134

But the key is to remain calm -- this isn't the first time the public has been warned about swine flu. The last time was in 1976, right before I entered medical school and I remember it very clearly. It resulted in the massive swine flu vaccine campaign.<p>""Within a few months, claims totaling $1.3 billion had been filed by victims who had suffered paralysis from the vaccine. The vaccine was also blamed for 25 deaths.<p>""However, several hundred people developed crippling Guillain-Barr√© Syndrome after they were injected with the swine flu vaccine. Even healthy 20-year-olds ended up as paraplegics.<p>""And the swine flu pandemic itself? It never materialized.""<p>""More People Died From the [1976] Swine Flu Vaccine than Swine Flu!""<p>""Personally, I am highly skeptical. It simply doesn't add up to a real pandemic.<p>""But it does raise serious questions about where this brand new, never before seen [swine flu] virus came from, especially since it cannot be contracted from eating pork products, and has never before been seen in pigs, and contains traits from the bird flu -- and which, so far, only seems to respond to Tamiflu. Are we just that lucky, or... what?""<p>""Could a mixed animal-human mutant like this occur naturally? And if not, who made it, and how was it released?<p>""Not one to dabble too deep in conspiracy theories, I don't have to strain very hard to find actual facts to support the notion that this may not be a natural mutation, and that those who stand to gain have the wherewithal to pull off such a stunt.""",1241076196
586522,comment,586309,586452,0,0,menloparkbum,,,"Thanks. I was curious because I've never had an actual test for the flu. However, I have had a PCR test for hepatitis after a bout of food poisoning. My HMO got back to me pretty quick with that test, so I'm guessing whatever lab they use has the necessary gear. Thus, I was curious as to whether or not my HMO could quickly retool its testing center with the right equipment to test for this flu virus.<p>I did a bit more research and it does look like the swine flu test is PCR based. However, it looks like there's only one vendor for this particular test. Indeed it does look like samples must be shipped out to labs which have the right equipment.",1241076194

For example, in the case of terrorism, which we really have no way to prevent and can just as easily hit the rich as it can the poor.  Hence, the jokes that we hear nightly about Osama, etc.<p>But the people who buy these shirts or make these games probably won't have to deal with swine flu (or at least die from it), because they likely have good healthcare and their nations are relatively rich with infrastructures that can accommodate a large percentage of their populations becoming sick at once.  I don't think they're in a position to mock the disease.<p>On the other hand, I'm fine the Mexicans who are sprucing up their face masks with funny mustaches as people are dying around them.

The typical versions of the influenza that has been going around (usually the antigens are in the the flu shots) have similar proteins that we have some level of defense to, but when we encounter (in this case) a new virus that we have no defense, our bodies just go way overboard on the defense response and if not properly treated - basically die of asphyxiation.",1241075026

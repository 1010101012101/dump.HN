This is a very common experience - very much more common, in fact, than the actual number of life-threatening injuries suffered by bare-headed cyclists. Yet there is no evidence that helmets save lives or prevent serious injury at all across cyclists as a whole""</i><p>The PDF linked at the bottom is good too, it's written by a guy that runs a cycle helmet testing lab.<p><a href=""http://www.cyclehelmets.org/papers/c2023.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cyclehelmets.org/papers/c2023.pdf</a><p>It's an in-depth piece and I don't want to do it an injustice by over-summarizing but here's my take: helmets by design and because of basic physical limits on their size are good for when you fall off a bike onto a flat surface at low speed, not for collisions, certainly not getting hit by speeding cars. Therefore they make a lot of sense for children learning to cycle or others prone to falling off, and much less sense for average cyclists.",1254909252

866378,comment,865695,866247,0,0,ubernostrum,,,"Well.<p>I've written at length about this in the past, and basically my opinion comes down to there being two ways to approach this. One is driven by the application, the other is driven by the database.<p>The application-driven approach is, I believe, the vastly more common use case: you have some <i>things</i> in your code (objects, data structures, whatever) and want some way to persist them and fetch them back later according to their properties, so you use a SQL-based DB because, hey, you can get them for zero monetary cost (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, etc.), every language has ways to speak SQL and every developer on your team knows SQL.<p>The database-driven approach is, in my experience, less common: you start with the database, design it meticulously, take full advantage of the relational model and the features it and your DB offer, build as much as possible in the DB layer and then let people write applications which talk to it.<p>Both you, and the author of the reply in the email this thread links to, seem to inhabit the latter use case. And that's fine; I know people who do that stuff and I respect it. Where the problem comes in is that you have a tendency to assume that <i>your</i> use case and <i>your</i> approach are or should be the <i>only</i> use case and approach. Which is, frankly, wrong. There are plenty of situations where the application-driven approach does just fine and will take you a very, very long way (and when it breaks down, it probably will not break down because you need to switch to the database-driven approach; it'll break down because of other things), and where the database-driven approach really isn't a great fit (for various reasons).",1254907696
866377,comment,866299,866358,0,0,chris123,,,"RE: ""make sure the VC doesn't have a conflicting investment"": This is very important.<p>My recommendation is to proceed like this:<p>1) Tell then a little about your project (not being cagey, just progressive disclosure) and ask if they have any conflicts, such as existing investments or close relationships ti similar companies.<p>2) If there are no conflicts, then memorialize this via email (maybe you had this whole conversation via email already, so you're done).<p>3) Save that email, it is evidence of you disclosing enough about your product/service/whatever for them to determine if they have a conflict or not and them representing that there is no conflict.<p>4) Proceed and peel back some more layers of the onion.  Explore together and ask them as many questions as they ask you.  Do not fall into the ""I'm pitching them"" role.  You are ""pitching"" each other, if you insist on using that word.

866358,comment,866299,866299,0,0,wavesplash,,,"Excellent points.  I have very little to add but a few minor bits:<p>- Don't worry about NDAs with VCs.  At least on this side of the pond, no VC is going to sign them.  Don't leave your full deck behind in digital form.  Leave them a summary deck on paper if you absolutely must. (just assume the deck will get passed outside the firm).<p>- Do make sure the VC doesn't have a conflicting investment - if so, assume everything you talk about will be going into the ears of your competitors.<p>- Avoid spotters/associates.  Get referred in to a partner by another entrepreneur they've worked with before (work your linkedin or xing).  Don't take a 1st meeting with an associate (feel free to chat with them on the phone briefly).  If a firm wants to see you, then they can find a partner to talk to you.  Associates can only say 'no' and generally have limited deal experience and just may not understand your market (of course there are exceptional individuals and firms where this doesn't apply).<p>- Timing is everything.  When you're ready to go out - have a list of VCs you want to speak with and try to get all your meetings lined up for the same two to three weeks.  VCs all talk to each other.  Once they hear another firm passed on your deal, it's harder to get the next one to bite.  Make it a parallel competition.  Don't overexpose your company.<p>- Do research on the firm and the partner that you're pitching.  <a href=""http://www.thefunded.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thefunded.com</a> is free for founders.

866350,comment,866299,866330,0,0,jacquesm,,,"The most recent stuff is related to 'infocaster', before that 'camarades', but that's already quite a while ago.<p>My NDA with the VCs I've worked for is such that I can not give you the names of the companies that I did tdd for without asking them and I don't see how it really would matter which companies they are, but the deals were on the order of tens of millions of euros, so a little larger than your average seed investment.<p>The principles are much the same at that level but the procedures are far more formal and in depth than at the lower levels of investment. Due diligence for a larger company can take several weeks, at the start-up level there is usually not a whole lot in terms of financial and legal, later those are actually the bigger portion of the time.<p>There usually is quite a bit of time pressure.<p>When taken as a percentage of the value of the deal due diligence can cost quite a bit in early stage investments, so it can be a partner or the CFO/CTO of a company 'friendly' to the VC (or one they've already invested in) that will have a thorough look.<p>Later, as the amounts go up and there is a lot more money available to have this work done by outsiders, also because it usually is too much work to do as a favour.<p>The VC world is a very tightly interwoven one, lots of partners have a stake in more than one company, some may even have an angel fund of their own. So when you pitch to a VC and you don't get a deal there is still a small chance that one of the VCs partners will do an investment out of their own pocket, outside of the main fund.<p>And sometimes that's the way to get an investment for a 'stage mismatch', where a VC is interested in you but your current situation does not match their preferred profile. They can then do a smaller investment through one of the partners, it gives them the inside view for relatively little money and it is a way to hedge their bets. By the time you're ready for a larger round they'll have their foot in the door and will be preferred candidate.",1254906130

If optimizing can quickly and cheaply get you to a position of advantage over your competitors, then why not go for it?  This happens a lot in weapons development.  You sometimes get greater increases in operational capability through the refinement of existing designs.  The Sidewinder missile is an example.  The M60A3 Patton tank was another.

The problem is that less and less companies are having IPOs and reaching massive size to carry out their original vision properly. Instead, their liquidation option is acquisition, which keeps the CEOs of big, rich companies in power and lets them carry out the visions of acquirees the way they see fit -- which usually isn't the optimal solution.<p>A founder is much more suited to carry out his or her vision by having millions of dollars in the bank and no constraints, rather than be constrained by the acquiring company in a system that is bloated and become increasingly bureaucratic.",1244666893

651760,comment,651700,651700,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I strongly suspect the Swoopo model will be deemed to be illegal in the not distant future, at least in the US.  It is either gambling in the form of a raffle, or a ponzy scheme, or some combination of the two, which are heavily regulated or illegal, respectively.  Of course, Swoopo also does other things that are very probably illegal (offering products under different names in different markets on the same ""auction"", but only having one ""winner"").<p>I would also, personally, have serious ethical qualms about targeting the dumbest people with a rigged game.  Screwing really dumb people just seems low, since they also tend to have the least disposable income.<p>But, I suppose if you're not concerned about the ethical greyness of the idea, and you're not concerned about the business having to change rapidly in the future due to legal barriers, and you're not concerned about the fines and probable gambling backtaxes you'll end up paying, and the huge potential for class action lawsuits, etc. the Swoopo model is making a small number of people fantastically wealthy in a very short period of time.

Emacs/Slime is probably the most popular, but I think there are addons for the Java IDEs too.<p>2. That may depend on what you're scraping. Manipulating semi-structured text data is one of Perl's biggest uses, so it may work a bit better than Clojure for the same purpose. Clojure certainly has decent regex and string capabilities though, so yes, it's a good choice.<p>3. Yes. There's a very good dataflow library for Common Lisp called Cells. It provides dependent and independent variables that work a lot like spreadsheet cells within a program. There's a partial port to Clojure. Also, Clojure has watchers - functions that can be attached to reference types and run whenever their state changes.

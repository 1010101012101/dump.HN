""Now look at consumption-services markets. Social web tools which aid in the consumption of goods, or which are forms of consumption in their own right, represent absolute costs. And if there’s anything we’ve learnt about absolute costs in the digital world, it’s that people are unwilling to bear them. I don’t want to speculate too much about why this may be. I will note that people are seemingly unwilling to incur costs which they know are in place purely to generate profit rather than to shoulder distribution and manufacturing outlays (as admittedly unfair this is of consumers).""<p>These are the Dipshit Companies: taking heavy investment without letting to know to their users how they will return, on behalf of whom they will generate profit.<p>Educated users are watching carefully this current VC 'bubble' trying to imagine themselves as VCs investing in Facebook and wondering why worth it when users will never pay a penny to use it.

1560905,comment,1559838,1560230,0,0,BrianHV,,,"Piano and guitar are more similar than you think.<p>A lot of guitar music, especially on the net, is written just as chords, which may be what you're thinking of.  But the chords are the same notes whether you're playing them on guitar or piano.  You could play exactly the same thing on piano as the guitar players do, and aside from sounding a little stiff, would make good musical sense.  It's also common in pop and jazz for piano players to read off chord sheets (lead sheets).<p>Likewise, guitar music can be written out note-by-note just as piano music generally is.  Classical guitar music is written this way, as well as rock leads.<p>Here's the thing about it, though.  If you're thinking of it as individual notes, you're doing it the hard way.  Scales and chords are a form of compression between the page and your brain, just as gzip is a form of compression between the web server and your browser.  Once you figure them out, you can look at a measure and know what keys you need to hit without having to look at each note individually.

So a positive voltage applied to the drain immediately pushes current from source to drain. Thus the amount of current is varied by applying a negative voltage to the gate, which restricts the number of electrons available to flow from source to drain. A large enough negative voltage turns off the flow altogether. Thus in contrast to a silicon FET, which is normally off, a GaN FET is normally on.</i><p>(Somewhat misleading; silicon FETs that are &quot;normally off&quot; are enhancement-mode transistors. Of course, there are depletion-mode MOSFETs, and of course JFETs. There are even power MOSFETS that are depletion mode, see here:
<a href=""http://www.ixys.com/documents/appnotes/ixan0063.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ixys.com/documents/appnotes/ixan0063.pdf</a>
In any case, this confirms the new transistor to be a depletion mode device. This has implications for biasing which could be inconvenient in some applications. In any case, it means it&#x27;s not simply drop-in replacement for enhancement-mode MOSFETs in existing designs.)<p>> <i>One of us (Mishra) has succeeded in making bipolar GaN transistors. But they are not yet as reliable as the FETs because at the moment it is very difficult to make p-type material good enough to use in a bipolar transistor. Applying electrical contacts to the material, as is necessary to connect the device into a circuit, often wiped out the semiconductor&#x27;s p-type character.</i><p>If these challenges are solved, the idea of a new kind of BJT is exciting.",1431133108

9514962,comment,9514270,9514420,0,0,deckiedan,,,"The thing I struggle most with with Haskell is the direction towards cleverness that code seems to tend towards.<p>I guess a lot of it may be a mindset issue - but the way the python forces simplicity is quite appealing to me.  I&#x27;ve heard similar thoughts from people who like Go.<p>&#x27;Good&#x27; refactoring in Pythonland tends to mean often splitting things into smaller functions.<p>In Haskell, it can mean making functions &#x27;points free&#x27;, which is clever, can result in very nice looking one-line functions, which are totally incomprehensible unless you know exactly what types all the functions involved take and return.  Or moving the logic out into combinators or higher order functions which can be used in many places, but become increasingly abstract in name and in variables.<p>Partial application & currying are amazing, and often results in very elegant solutions - but again, unless you know beforehand how many arguments a function takes, it&#x27;s easy to miss that someone is talking about a curried function, and not the result of said function.<p>The crazy math-oriented naming of variables by single letters rather than by &#x27;accumulator&#x27; or &#x27;first_input&#x27; or whatever, especially in tutorials, API documentation, etc. also require an extra mental effort each time.  It reminds me a bit of perl, in that way.  Just because you <i>can</i> write code as a one-liner, doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s always a good idea.  Python refuses to let you write code as a one-liner (beyond very simple things), and so the tendency to name things extremely laconically is reduced.  Pylint and other tools even throw warnings when you try to use single-letter variable names.<p>The argument always is, &#x27;You can write complex & hard to understand code in any language!&#x27;.  Yes.  That&#x27;s true.  Of course.  But also, languages are more than just the syntax, the culture and available libraries & documentation are quite a big thing too.<p>The direction of Haskell code is, at least in my feeling, towards increasingly abstract concepts.  The direction of Python code is, IMHO, towards simplicity.<p>Another, perhaps related issue is Exceptions.  In simple scripting / basic applications, you could have a whole bunch of different exceptions raised, and honestly, you don&#x27;t care which one.<p>For instance, saving a file.  If there&#x27;s a permission error, out of HD space, invalid filename for this disk format, network timeout on NFS, restrictions on what kind of data can be put in this filetype, whatever.  Some of these may be IOErrors, some may be json encoding errors, or whatever.  Often, I don&#x27;t care which it is, I just want to throw up an error message saying, &quot;Something went wrong: %s.&quot; % err.msg.  Being able to ignore exceptions in the small, write very simple & concise code that can raise many different kinds of exceptions, and only catch them further up where it makes sense can often mean I can lump many unrelated types of exceptions together by what area of the application they&#x27;re part of.<p>I feel like Python is moving in the direction of a better compile-time experience with the new type annotation stuff in the latest 3.x version.  I really miss that security when working in Python.",1431132851

It may be of religious origin (it&#x27;s central in Christianity but probably also exists in Judaism and even earlier religions) or it may be just something that is a consequence of empathy.<p>Some people believe that people born handicapped should have to take care of themselves and that they shouldn&#x27;t have to contribute anything (eg paying taxes) to their welfare, even if they die. Their lives is not their problem so why should they pay for something like handicapped children that they didn&#x27;t cause?<p>I think you have a duty to help the less fortunate because that&#x27;s the right thing to do, others may disagree.

  last check) because the devs felt it was central to their
  design

  2) terrible UI graphics (I know this is subjective,

  polished compared to SimCity 2000 or SimCity 3 even
  and look like they were made by a programmer

  3) funky road placement; the road placement tools have a

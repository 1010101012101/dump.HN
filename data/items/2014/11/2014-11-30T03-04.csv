8675922,comment,8673760,8675756,0,0,Tenobrus,,,"Morals sure as hell are math, just like everything else.<p>I wasn&#x27;t using the &quot;save 10 children&quot; to obscure your reasoning, I was pointing out an extreme case where your reasoning breaks down. You can reasonably call someone who punches you in the face (without good reason) a &quot;bad person&quot;. But if you find out they&#x27;ve personally saved 10 children&#x27;s lives I&#x27;m pretty sure you&#x27;d think they were a good person. Plus what people mean when they call someone &quot;moral&quot; or &quot;immoral&quot; usually has to do with both their actions and their predicted future actions. Again, most people are fine with calling a reformed thief &quot;moral&quot; under certain conditions, even if they&#x27;ve never personally repaid the specific people they&#x27;ve wronged, because they don&#x27;t seem likely to be immoral in the future. If you are not willing to do this you are in the minority. Your example is dishonest because murdering someone generally indicates a lack of self control or level of sociopathy that makes future violence incredibly likely. Also murdering someone purely because you don&#x27;t like them very much or you have something to gain from it is generally seen as more evil than saving a life is good. If someone murdered in cold blood and then went on to save every starving person in the world, then they are also-fucking-lutley a good person. You might want to keep a watch on them, but that seems like a pretty strong indication their murderin days are behind them, and is way more than enough to make up for it.",1417319510

- advanced searching and alerting based on those searches (search agents?)

The solution to the drug problem is to provide safe and legal avenues for drug use, and healthy environments for detecting and treating abuse.<p>Your statement assumes that drug prohibitions exist to protect the health of the public. This is, as you&#x27;ve pointed out, demonstrably false. If, on the other hand, you view drug laws as a means to criminalize a large percentage of the population and give police a ton of discretion in declaring who is and isn&#x27;t a criminal, the situation become entirely consistent and you realize that drug laws are nothing more than a way to keep prisons full and allow police to remove &quot;undesirables&quot; (read: minorities) from society.<p>Allowing the the drug war to be framed as a public health issue means arguing on terms chosen by proponents of the drug war. We need to reject that premise and discuss it for what it really is, a racially-motivated tool for social repression. If those that argue against what you suggest (safe an legal avenues for drug use) were forced to show that, absent the current drug laws, the damage to society would be greater than the damage inflicted by the drug laws themselves, their arguments would look even more foolish than they currently appear.",1417316570

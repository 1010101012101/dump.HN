We are growing rapidly and although a full time employee would be great to fill a few roles, I have been able to manage it with freelance help. One thing to note is that most freelancers we work with have been working with us since the start of the business. We currently have 14 freelancers and each of them work on 2-3 projects each month.<p>We try to take care of them to the best of our abilities. Giving out bonuses, pay raises per project, birthday cards, gift certificates and all to show our appreciation. As the business grows and if we can manage the growth with freelance help, is it wise to not hire full-time employees given all the hassles tha come with hiring full time? Or should I continue to take this path?<p>Feel free to ask questions. Would like to not disclose the name of the business or what we provide at this point. Your feedback is much appreciated.",1336024745

My idea of immersion has always been using that language and only that language. The official definition of immersion is 'a method of teaching in a foreign language that involves exclusive use of the language'. The plugin's implementation is more like the opposite of immersion.<p>I'm still skeptical of people without prior knowledge of the language using this plugin because learning via computational translations is unnatural and detrimental to beginners who don't know any better. Beginners don't know when something has been translated wrongly or if that phrase is how a native would express it. This makes the plugin a little redundant, since their market would have to be people who are neither beginners nor completely fluent (since someone that is fluent can engage in actual immersion). The only instance where the plugin would be useful is for people with prior knowledge of the language (can read and write it to a certain extent) but would like to expand their vocabulary bank.",1336023304

The constant switching between languages when it comes to reading is quite cumbersome, even if it is for the sake of learning. This is particularly so for languages of different forms like English and Chinese. Words/phrases that are slang cannot be directly translatable, which is detrimental to beginners who do not know that it has been incorrectly translated.

596904,comment,595465,595726,0,0,tybris,,,"European countries have far more social structure than the US. People are part of groups (tribes) formed around religion, culture, nationality, language, political ideals, labour, and even football. It is the group, not the individual, that takes care of its members. Members of the group contribute and the leaders decide what happens with the contributions. This model doesn't fit individual compassion, because it would distantiate you from the group (""you (member) think we (the group) are not doing enough!?"").<p>That being said, Christianity was in fact the binding element that provided Western-Europe with its strong social structure that still exists today. It was not so much the Bible or morale that bound them, for most it was in fact the fight against catholic oppression that led to Calvinism and other reformations. Without support or leadership from the Vatican, protestants formed scattered social groups, in which members had to protect and support each other. In doing so they found themselves reinventing the biblical message. To protect the family, social gatherings (sunday prayers), give to the poor (prevent them from stealing), take care of the weak. Again, not as individuals, but as a group.<p>The US on the other hand, was formed through immigration of people who had little or no social relations with each other. The result was an individualistic society where everyone took care of themselves. However, such a system is not inately human. There is no one to take care of the inevitable unfortunate. The individual compassion that is enabled by the lack of social commitments cannot begin to pay the rent for a single mother, the health care bill of a retiree, or the school books of a poor man's daughter. As economic tides reveal the pain of individualism groups are formed.<p>Gradually, America is shifting towards a stronger social structure. Middle-America finds refuge for its mediocre economic opportunities in evangelical Christianity, whereas the people along the coast-lines are bounded by progressive politics. The growing schism between these groups is exemplary of the social bonds getting stronger.<p>This also reveals the dark side of social structure. Deep hatred between different groups. A hatred that far exceeds any individual conflict, a hatred that has led to all of history's atrocities we know so well. Yet, the social bonds are unavoidable. Man is meant to live in a tribe. That is how we evolved.",1241649830

Obviously, I believe that design can play a major role in newspapers, and really great design can be done. But it takes an amazing amount of coordination and manpower to pull of those designs. Several papers in the U.S. have been reknowned for this well-thought-out very highly designed content, including the Hartford Courant and the Virgina Pilot (and both have been named best-designed by SND at some point I believe), but it hasn't helped them as far as I'm aware.<p>There is a market for newspapers. I believe there probably always will be. But the market for 7-day-a-week local papers is dying fast. My headline was meant to be a bit snarky. My point really is: It's the INTERNET. No piece of hardware is going to change that.",1241648819

596828,comment,596683,596683,0,0,mdasen,,,"To be fair to Hulu, the restrictions on content distribution are from the networks, not Hulu.  To explain: a television show is created by a network or a third party and then that show is licensed for distribution within a country by that network or third party.  So, Disney makes Scrubs and runs it on ABC in the US (although it had licensed it to NBC for a while) and, if there is a market for it in other countries, licenses it to a network in those countries for distribution in that market.<p>So, when a network gives online distribution rights to Hulu for content, it's only for the US.  In order to make sure that they keep getting content, Hulu really has to prove that they won't be hacked - that Hulu can effectively serve ads that won't be easily blocked, that Hulu can control distribution, etc.<p>It sucks.  However, the behavior is more network/hollywood related than Hulu related.  I'm sure the Hulu folks would love to be an open free-for-all, but they also realize that by playing ball they're able to offer something that, frankly, I find more entertaining and a much better experience while also having a much greater potential for profit.<p>Who knows?  Maybe someday show creators will simply license their material for online distribution, completely bypassing networks and borders.  In the meantime, Hulu is trying to make sure they don't piss off their benefactors and have content yanked because they can't control distribution.  Is it good?  No.  But I'd blame the networks before leveling my anger at Hulu.",1241647282

It is not even a necessary component.  The only reason it exists at all is because of our inability to objectively determine guilt in most cases. The rest are tacked on (IE determinations of <i>what</i> crime has been committed. Even this would be solved if you could objectively determine what occurred)<p>However, again, if the defendant admits guilt (even if not in public), but still wants a trial, can you explain how the <i>system</i> is served by a fair trial on guilt or innocence for him, rather than a fair sentencing hearing?<p>In that case, the guilt or innocence is not in question.
The same is true when they only admit guilt to a defense attorney.
Defending the client, and trying to get them off during the trial stage, does not serve the ends of the system.
It may, depending on how formulated, serve some of the means, but that&#x27;s kind of irrelevant.",1372898414

So they are removing just about every form of security from the transaction. The letter that comes with the card is full of assurances that I bear no liability for misuse of the card.<p>So basically, the card providers are throwing security out the window because they want to increase the rate of legitimate transactions and then wholesale black banning whole segments of the market that have slightly higher risk to counterbalance the increased risk.

5988402,comment,5985377,5986824,1,0,bokonist,,,"I have been working for a fast growing/successful startup that has brought in a number of outside executives (though not a new CEO).  I am sure those executives have 100x the stock of the average engineer on the team.<p>These executives get paid the big bucks because a) they are scarce and b) their job has way more leverage than the job of an engineer.<p>The nature of hierarchies is that there are fewer people at the top.  Thus the number of people with a proven track record as executive is always much lower than the number of engineers.  Thus there is a small pool of executives for a company to hire from.<p>It is worth it for a company to pay top dollar for proven executive talent, because an executive has 10-100X more leverage than that of an average engineer.  The old line is that engineers can differ in productivity by orders of magnitude.  Well, the executives determine which engineers you end up with. So the difference in executive talent is that order of magnitude times the number of engineers. The executive determines how well they the team works together and how much distraction and interference the team gets from the forces of entropy and chaos that surround the department.  We have hired outstanding executives that have brought their divisions to new levels.  We have hired bad directors and VPs who were disastrous and were fired.  In some cases, a person who grew up with the company did not scale, and had to replaced.  In other cases a person has risen with the company and taken on enormous responsibilities.<p>I&#x27;m guessing that the outside executives brought in at a startup that is struggling are on average much, much worse than the outside executives we have brought in.  After all, the good executives will opt for a position at the company that is growing fast.  Who wants to try and save a sinking ship?",1372897629

It makes the reasonable point that you should be wary of cloud provider&#x27;s terms of service and their legal jurisdiction. Beyond this, it does not seem to offer any solutions.<p>The primary driver of analyzing the legal jurisdiction for any given cloud provider is probably regulatory pressure for data protection, however, you largely don&#x27;t have this problem if you are paranoid about your users&#x27; privacy anyway.<p>Other drivers might be operational security (resistance to regulatory change, cloud provider account closure or hijacking, physical asset seizure, disasters, etc.)<p>To ensure the latter whilst considering the former a fair rule of thumb might be to engage multiple independent cloud providers within the same legal jurisdiction to ensure legally permissible, automated cloud provider failover or migration.<p>While you could probably legally put the case that encrypting data before migrating it overseas constitutes reasonable protection and therefore avoids the ire of regulators, given that Europe is one jurisdiction for these purposes it&#x27;s fair to say that route is often slow (due to bandwidth intensive nature) between major markets.<p>Ahh, no easy solutions :)",1372897408

5988376,comment,5986158,5988092,2,0,_dps,,,"> For interfacing with C, I think cython is better than cffi.<p>I think we&#x27;ll have to agree to disagree on this. To quote the CFFI project description [0]: the goal is to be able to seamlessly call C from Python without having to learn a third language/API. Cython, Ctypes, and CPython&#x27;s C API all fail to meet this criterion, and in my opinion do so by a large margin. Let&#x27;s also not forget the fact that Cython requires a compilation step not only for the bound C code but also for the portion of the &quot;Python&quot; code that interfaces with it.<p>Compare that (or writing CPython C API manipulation code) with the following:<p><pre><code>  >>> from cffi import FFI
  >>> ffi = FFI()
  >>> ffi.cdef(&quot;int printf(const char *format, ...);&quot;)
  >>> C = ffi.dlopen(None)                     # loads the entire C namespace
  >>> arg = ffi.new(&quot;char[]&quot;, &quot;world&quot;)         # char arg[] = &quot;world&quot;;
  >>> C.printf(&quot;hi there, %s!\n&quot;, arg)         # call printf
  hi there, world!
</code></pre>
For me CFFI wins without question. Of course, it&#x27;s even simpler in LuaJIT (but the CFFI people are getting closer every day):<p><pre><code>  local ffi = require &quot;ffi&quot;
  ffi.cdef [[ int printf(const char*, ...); ]]
  ffi.C.printf(&quot;hi there, %s!\n&quot;, &quot;world&quot;)
</code></pre>
Now, it would be misleading for me not to point out the limitations of an approach like CFFI/LJ-FFI vs CPython API: you may have to contort yourself to make C calls that safely manipulate the scripting language VM (e.g. instantiate new Python objects from within a C FFI call). In my experience this has not been a serious problem because it&#x27;s easy to write struct-to-object mappers in idiomatic Python or Lua rather than having to muck about with PyObject* and friends. Of course, in LuaJIT it&#x27;s even easier with FFI metatypes (which let you attach dispatch tables to FFI native types, so your structs can behave just like Lua tables with method dispatch, inheritance, etc.).<p>Anyway, leaving personal taste aside for a moment, let me rephrase the original question that sparked my interest in your opinion: in a world with a mature CFFI option providing the above binding capabilities do you think that easy C extensions are still a worthwhile tradeoff for the GIL? (FWIW I find the point to be quite compelling for <i>why Python had a GIL to begin with in the late 90s</i>, but I&#x27;m suspecting it&#x27;s less of an intrinsic design tradeoff and more historical cruft as the PyPy and CFFI people roll out their work).<p>[0] <a href=""http://cffi.readthedocs.org/en/release-0.6/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cffi.readthedocs.org/en/release-0.6/</a>",1372897302

About ~6 were upper middle class.  That is they had parents wealthy enough to pay for a &quot;good&quot; school.  But the parents did not have enough money to fund their kids startup or pull on VC connections.  Around ~3 people came from well off parents, who might have had enough money for a small trust fund (I do not know whether they actually had a trust fund).  One had parents with VC connections.  Overall, the career arcs of the well-to-do founders were indistinguishable from the upper middle class kids.  The founders from upper class backgrounds were just as smart and hard working as any other founders.  The other three founders in my personal dataset were immigrants with very little family support and had to hustle their whole way up.<p>In my observations, getting VC funding requires at least one of five paths:<p>a) building a product via bootstrapping and/or seed money, and then either getting significant traction or have a prototype of genuinely novel tech.<p>b) developing a proven track record as an employee at a company.  Maybe you joined a startup early that became big.  Maybe you joined a big company and worked your way up to VP of Sales.<p>c) Having some specialized and valuable knowledge.  Maybe you consulted for a particular industry, and thus have inside knowledge about a valuable product that industry could use.  Maybe you a professor that just developed some new technology that can be commercialized.<p>d) going to business school, getting a job as VC associate, and then launching a company with some funding from that firm.<p>e) having started and exited a previous company<p>Getting VC funding requires connections.  But building these connections is a trivial problem compared to the problem of establishing a track record via either bootstrapping or working your way up at a company.  If you cannot establish those connections, you probably do not have the hustle it takes to found a company.  If you have VC connections, but no product with traction nor track record of success, then you are not getting funding.<p>The world michaelochurch describes, &quot;the VC-funded startup CEOs ... I know didn&#x27;t take any real risk, because they&#x27;re all trust-fund kids &quot; is a very different world than the one I have experienced.",1372896762

I guess every generation needs their reminder.<p>Still, the meta-point holds: centralized power lacks robustness (e.g. to corruption and/or the stupidity of a relative few), but has big advantages over widely distributed systems in terms of communication latency and bandwidth that enable efficiency. We&#x27;re sloshing around dynamically trying combinations, but we should expect to always see some centralized (opportunities for efficiency) and some distributed (opportunities for robustness) stuff going on.",1372896255

I subscribe to the following definition, as proposed in Wikipedia (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_liberties"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_liberties</a>)<p>> Civil liberties are civil rights and freedoms that provide an individual specific rights. Though the scope of the term differs amongst various countries, some examples of civil liberties include the freedom from slavery and forced labor, freedom from torture and death, the right to liberty and security, freedom of conscience, religion, expression, press, assembly and association, speech, the right to privacy, the right to equal treatment and due process and the right to a fair trial, as well as the right to life. Other civil liberties may also include the right to own property, the right to defend oneself, and the right to bodily integrity.<p>What do you consider your civil liberties to be?",1372896250

And, after all, AT&T has no obligations except to make money, and no public oversight. The best part is that since AT&T makes money off of this surveillance (even more information than NSA has out of AT&T, with less procedure) nobody is particularly upset about it. We are all just used to the idea that everything we do or say is owned by some private company which is empowered to sell it to whoever, and nobody wants to change it because there&#x27;s money to be made.",1372896195

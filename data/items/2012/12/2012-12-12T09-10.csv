4909335,comment,4906377,4908501,1,0,Spearchucker,,,"Messages are indeed idempotent. As I mentioned, if the response is lost you resend, until you do get a response. The server will accept the same message over and over, until the client stops sending the message (i.e. the server response was received by the client). The server simply discards any subsequent messages. That message integrity is verified with a hash value goes without saying.<p>The two generals problem is a non-problem. Messages don't equate to messenger's lives, in that there is no cost equivalent to a loss of life when resending a message. Also, the <i>probability</i> of not receiving a server response after n attempts is virtually null. Ref. how the internet continues to work.<p>Atomicity is only relevant where there's a batch. Delivery of all messages in a batch is taken care of as described in the previous paragraph, and I'm therefore satisfied that transmission will work. Persistence on the client and server is therefore where atomicity applies, and is subject to the same constraints that any database transaction is subject to (again, the risk impact is high, but the probability so low that while I could, I don't even bother[1]). I don't see a problem here.<p>[1] Hardware is quite sufficiently reliable these days. If I ever had to work in a scenario in which the cost of loss is sufficiently high (even considering the low probability of loss), then I'm still not sure what you suggest I do, because messages aren't placed onto a queue as a single operation. They're discreet. If they weren't I'd bundle them as a single message, and so wouldn't face the problem in the first place.",1355305104

4909289,comment,4905684,4909137,1,0,hpvic03,,,"> This is a misreading of evolution. To start with, we are not optimal. Not even locally optimal. No species is. Who is the optimal human? Is that person alive today?<p>Optimal refers to having the highest probability of surviving and reproducing in the given environment. Since humans dominate the earth, we are more optimal than any other species of animal.<p>From a genetics standpoint, the most ""optimal"" human would bear as many children as possible while still maintaining the earth as a hospitable environment, and minimize all potential risk factors that could harm his or her children. So yes, there is a theoretical maximum for evolution that we haven't reached, but we will likely never reach it.<p>> Second, you haven't considered timescale. You say ""get weeded out"". How long does that process take?...How can you tell that the behavior you are examining increases fitness or decreases fitness but happens to be in the same genome as something else which greatly increases fitness...Some researchers then point to the increase in nose picking in the general population and conjecture that nose picking must have conferred some genetic advantage. But this is wrong. Nose picking came along for the ride.<p>Meiosis randomly splits chromosomes via crossing over, then pulls out one half of the chromosomes (23) to later pair with the 23 chromosomes from the other zygote (sperm or egg cell). After enough iterations this process can isolate genes that increase or decrease fitness.<p>> Third, the coupling between behavior and genes can be extremely tenuous. 300 years ago you could look at European populations and conclude that they were genetically predisposed towards monarchy. Some believed that this was the natural order of things. Where's the gene for democracy? 1000 years ago you could conclude that there was a genetic predisposition towards Catholicism. What genetics caused people to chose that over, say, Zoroastrianism?<p>Culture certainly affects behavior, yet humans have sex and produce kids in every culture. When it comes to survival and reproduction, genetics preempts culture when it comes to individual behavior. Democracy isn't an individual behavior, it's a cultural idea. People typically live under whatever government they're born into. Same with religion.<p>It seems logical that women could be genetically predisposed to desire multiple partners in order to increase the variety of genes and thus enhance the fitness value of their offspring. However, I do not know how you could prove or disprove this idea.",1355303502

Since Britain is on a single grid, the local conditions shouldn't affect the recorded signal.  I'm sure it is possible to find patterns (frequency drops slightly in the morning as the public utility tries to keep up with increasing demand), but you wouldn't know, for example that the utility overestimated demand on the particular morning that the audio was alleged to have been recorded (and thus that the frequency was actually higher).<p>As for point 1, there are a number of plausible angles to approach this, but I think that the forensic adversary has a huge advantage: Synchronous detection.  The approximate time of the recording is known, as is the historical record of mains frequency.  That allows for the possibility of huge processing gain, which might allow for recovery even after the amplitude of the mains hum is filtered to below the quanta of the audio system.  I almost think you might have to Fourier Transform the whole audio record and zero out any component at f_mains +/- delta (and harmonics). That, of course, would look pretty suspicious to a forensic analyst.<p>Even that might not be enough if mains hum has a determinable effect on the data compression algorithm used to store the audio data.<p>Edit: The point I was trying to make in the first paragraph is that if you wanted to forge a recording, you'd need to have the grid frequency data.

Is overpaying to cover downside risks ""smart"" but overpaying for big upsides ""stupid""? I don't have an opinion either way.

I understand the allure of just getting features out when you're trying things and don't have many customers to worry about. But the old adage of 'always time to do it over but never time to do it right' applies just as well early as it does later. Resist the temptation to throw away all discipline because 'it's just a prototype and we'll re-write it later.' The reality is, if your product catches on, you're going to be living with that code for a long time. Move fast, yes, but don't move sloppy.",1333302446

If you can show that there is no COI between you working on your SaaS product and your day job, there should be little grounds (or interest) on the part of your employer to come after you. You should probably be worried not just about code <i>updates</i> to the web application, but to the revenue stream that your SaaS product is generating.<p>At this point (assuming you are employed), you have three options:<p>1) Talk to somebody in the company (Legal/CEO, depending on size of company). Have the awkward conversation and come to an agreement.<p>2) Stop working on your SaaS product, but don't tell your employer.<p>3) Continue working on the SaaS product without informing your employer (i.e. gamble that you can fly under the radar).<p>If you're not employed yet and just entertaining a job offer, do #1.<p>If you're employed, I suggest doing #1 if you feel that you want to keep working on your pride and joy. If they become real pricks about it, perhaps you could negotiate ownership stake in your SaaS company and outsource or have your co-founder continue coding.<p>It seems unlikely you'll seriously consider #2 if the SaaS product is making some money. If you go down this route, keep records 'just-in-case' showing that you ceased all development at X date (which would hopefully coincide with your date of employment).<p>If you go #3, be prepared to lawyer up if your employer catches on (e.g. SaaS product starts garnishing serious attention).<p>I'm not a lawyer, but if somebody on my team came to me with this problem, those would be the options I'd lay out for them.",1333301391

It would be better if the game continued progressing indefinitely, with the player making more and more money but the enemies getting stronger and stronger until even the best defenses reach a breaking point.  As it stands now, the player can continue after the game ends at round 50, but he/she makes little money.  Even without knowing what the different towers did and what angles later enemies would be approaching the building from, I was still able to win on the first try just by placing towers near roads and buying upgrades as soon as I could.<p>-An implementation of street view would be pretty cool.  Players could see their towers added to the landscape and watch the enemies storming down New York Ave.  Might be really difficult though.<p>-More complexity and variety would make it better.",1333301179

The stack/heap distinction is no different between Go and Java.<p>The idea that ""the suboptimality of Go's GC is much less significant"" is just wrong -- Go has <i>the exact same memory model as Java</i>, only it's less well equipped to deal with it than Java is because its GC is so suboptimal.

They should know better than to weaken our glorious leader capitalism and deserve to pay dearly for it! It's the customer's own fault for actually trying to secure some rights, so the companies are perfectly right in arbitrarily raising prices, and I request these companies to raise the prices even further, to give them Europeans a better taste of what power the modern supra-national company holds!<p>It is a pity though. The richest company in the world, that does not know what to do with all its riches, has to subject itself to the same laws everyone else has to. Better raise the prices, because by no means have they gained profit from misleading customer into purchasing additional services, right? ""What, we have to abide to the law? Well, that will lower our profit margins, better raise prices so we can make the same profit, only this time without actually evading legislation.""",1333300689

I had noticed that people would actually download the app after clicking to it before, and I had wanted to drive the downloads up to over 500 from the 350 it was at now.<p>One of the things I had done in the update was to remove ads from the free version of the app and to stop feature updates to the free version.  I was making no money on the ads ($1.47 in total) and as it was slowing down the loading of the screen, I decided to remove it altogether.<p>Funnily enough, the new ads never got approved.  I suspect that this has to do with me removing the ads from the app and claiming as much in my ""what's new"" section, but of course I can't substantiate this.  All ads were copied from an older ad  that had successfully run and had itself been a copy of a previous one.  None of the new ads were run and no info was given to me.

I wanted it to be easy to use even for non developers or non technical people. That's why I was trying to build it purely in html/css/javascript and without any backend support.

An evil game company isn't really interested in making games, it's too busy playing a game -- a game with the stock market, usually. It views players as weak-minded cash cows; and it views its developers as expendable, replaceable tools to create the machines that milk those cows.</i>",1333299656

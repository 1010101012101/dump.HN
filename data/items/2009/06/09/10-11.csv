I have considered writing briefly in the past but gave up due to lack of motivation - so your probably going the right way for attempt #1. Thinking about it now were I to go back and seriously try again I suspect I'd end up in the same place.<p>Well r.e. PG I just meant that it's not the same as a penniless author considering writing a book. PG can invest his time in writing those essays because it serves a purpose (i.e. establishes his credentials and respect). BUT he gets coverage on a lot of those essays by already being respected (like topping up the tank :)). And if they get ignored (unlikely) there's no financial fall out for him.<p>Im sure there are lots of people in the same boat with some great things to say: but many get passed over and go unnoticed.<p>But, meh it's hardly worth disagreeing over :D thanks for the info.",1244543801

Why do you assume they will die?<p>I sincerely doubt they'd send anyone to their deaths nor that anyone would accept it, that would be absurd (tho accidents can happen). Consider the amount of effort, time and money such a trip would take. With the right focus, in 50 years we could have the technology to sustain life in space. However, the right focus probably means ""if we have something to gain from it"". I guess that's why he thinks of a ""Big Brother in Space"" program that would cover part of the costs.

In theory I could write it for Lulu or as an ebook, and perhaps have better margins. But knowing myself, my chances of success are <i>much</i> higher if I have another party being interested in the project (the publisher). There is a deadline and so on, and hopefully some experience the publisher can bring to the table.<p>Maybe it is silly, but I am also thinking ""this could be the last opportunity to do this, before publishers and maybe even books cease to exist"". Doing it the old fashioned way I mean. I can very well imagine that if it works out, I would try to publish future books via Lulu or as e-books.<p>PG as an example: that is exactly the point though, he made his money elsewhere. But I also think that without his essays, YCombinator would probably not be what it is.<p>As for fiction books, I don't know, but I don't think the sales prospects for an average book are much better. It could be a bit like an iPhone app store multiplied by a million - thousands and thousands of authors writing books, but only very few of them taking off and making money out of it.",1244542841

Any 1st world citizen will be reduced into an ""African"" once thrown in jail and stripped of all property; they end up collecting small items and fashioning them to works of art.

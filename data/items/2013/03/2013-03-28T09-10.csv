How would we regulate it? Everyone will be taking pictures of everything! It sounded like anarchy in the eyes of the press but now we see how silly that was<p>No, it's not silly. People taking photos without asking consent is a problem. Not anarchy (for certain IMHO ill-defined values of 'anarchy') but still not good<p>> its not clear to us (yet!) when someone will be filming or snapping photos<p>That's not the (only) problem. The problem I see is Google storing those photos and video clips on their own server<p>> that small screen is right about the same spot in my visual periphery as the rear-view mirror on my car<p>You check that for a fraction of a second, you don't try to read the license plate on every car behind you. And chances are that if you see something interesting in your mirror and keep staring, you'll eventually crash.<p>>  thats irresponsible. Its irresponsible because we dont know anything about Glass yet<p>So now being cautious and asking yourself about worst-case scenarios is irresponsible. Well, ok...<p>> but if were not doing anything wrong there isnt much to worry about with Google Glass and being filmed<p>Same old argument about having nothing to hide, I won't discuss this further as it has already been.<p>> Google Glass is happening, like it or not<p>What if dictatorship (or anything you'd rather not happening, if we want to avoid hyperbole) was happening, like it or not?<p>> Those same people who are damning the technology havent even tried it out, so how are they in a position to judge it?<p>I never jumped from a roof, so who am I to judge it dangerous?<p>> We needed massive amounts of proven cases where texting while driving was dangerous<p>And this is this a good thing?<p>> Someday, well all search for these old articles about Glass on Glass. That much we <i>do</i> know.<p>So it's irresponsible to say it could be detrimental to privacy without having tried it, but it's ok to say everybody will wear it.<p>> Android is my life, plain and simple. I actually live by our Mantra of ""Eat. Sleep. Android""!<p>Not to go ad-hominem over this, but should we really give credit to this fanboy. I don't think so...

Execution is already in parallel, it just uses regular collections as the concurrent ones weren't worth the performance overhead and in the end Akka ran 44% faster than Erlang. In the comments you refer to having 50% Erlang is roughly the same as 44%, so I don't thing there is much performance difference even though Java/Scala is faster than Erlang in general.<p>Regarding soft realtime requirements Erlang may be a better choice, but I doubt there are too many use cases where it will make much difference.",1364464693

Predictable performance, decent debugging, etc. One can even decide to use platform-specific features if strictly necessary.<p>The problem it has is that it is largely opaque to the JITs in browser engines (even PNaCl, since JS JITs have nothing to do with llvm). One way to fix that would be to define a simple byte code as a compilation target and have people compile to that, in addition to compilation to JS with emacripten. The end result would be, in my opinion, much cleaner than the ugly hacks in asm.js<p>Furthermore, by design, asm.js will always need guards in the generated code, thus some overhead that can never be fully removed (although JITs will help with this). In particular, one can write ""x = +x"" in JS, but then change the type of x, thus invalidating the invariant. A guard will be needed to guarantee correctness, since asm.js is a subset of JS, but the outer set still exists.<p>It seems to me that web technologies are getting more and more crazy.

Familiarity will surely overcome any lack of intuitive meaning very quickly. The same applies if youre using made up operators but they reflect some intuitive syntax or conventional notation in whatever field youre working in. In all of these cases, having a concise notation for frequently occurring concepts is surely a benefit, other things being equal.<p>However, as you start to represent more specialised or esoteric concepts, I wonder whether there are diminishing returns and increasing risks.

But basically I have the same issues and fears.<p>I'm afraid people here are right about the weed. I drink an unhealthy amount of beer (1-2 liters) every day to help me relax. I know it's fucking up my head in the long run and it would be better to get off it for a while to clear my head, but every night after a long day, even if it wasn't as productive as I'd like (actually especially if it wasn't) I go f<i>ck this sh</i>t, I need a beer!<p>I'm still in the process of launching my first product, living on savings, so I too feel like being in a financial stranglehold - either this works out or I'll have to go into prostitution or something, because just as you say, there is no freaking way I can go back to a 9 to 5 programmer job, taking order from some boss or clients or even just getting up every morning to show up at some office and stay there all day.<p>I envy people who already have achieved financial freedom with their businesses, there is so much in life I would want to do (go scuba diving as an example), but I feel quite penniless and very limited. A horrible feeling that makes me feel depressed every other day.<p>Sometimes I'd just like to ""break out"" but I wouldn't know where to?! I already quit my job to work for myself and be my own boss. I guess this struggle is just the price I'm paying for the freedom that is hopefully to come...<p>Anyway man, stay strong, you're not alone.",1364461330

Three.Js has been a cool library to import 3d models in various file formats and render them, just using Javascript without need of flash or any 3d player. A editor is a good next step.<p>For those seeing empty screens or white-pages, your browser may not be configured or doesn't support webgl. Three JS supports a svg and a canvas renderer.

Any website with a login form can sue Loitr. We have just released the Wordpress plugin for Loitr. All that users of your blog have to do is download the Loitr app, and scan the activation QR visible on their dashboard(visible if the Loitr plugin is activated) and next time all they have to do is scan the login QR at the login form.<p>Special Note: Loitr doesn't need to know the usernames or passwords of the users of your blog, thus Loitr doesn't add to the security risk of your service. Since there is no username or password in the entire method, it does away with conventional MITM attacks.<p>I'd love to gather some feedback about what the community thinks of it.",1364461210

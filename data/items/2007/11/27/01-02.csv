(It's like an upvote, but I think data that reflects actual usage of a system is more honest than data that users say reflects their opinion.  Think del.icio.us vs. yahoo directory.)<p>Pretty gameable, too.",1196127534

After trying all kind of stuff I had to come back here to get a feeling of what you were trying to do. <p>You need to make it dead clear what the website does if you want to retain any users.",1196127529
83779,comment,83569,83680,0,0,greendestiny,,,"I think that's a great description of the process. I would make the point that designing on customer language in OOP is one of those things experienced programmers shy away from. The next paragraph about ""What to do, when"" is a much better source of OOP design. Just to take the example of account balance, in looking at business-type worries it would probably become clear that transactional integrity is a big deal in this kind of software, so you'd want to clearly separate out queries on the balance and modifications to the balance and restrict access to the functions. These sorts of pressures, along with technical pressures much more clearly describe the design parameters.",1196127107

83773,story,,,6,5,krschultz,"Ask YC: Finding start ups?",,"I've heard ""the best way to learn about start-ups is to work in one"" - it strikes me as great advice. I learned a lot more about selling working as a salesman than I would have if I just spent time reading websites about it. Thats where I am stuck now, I've spent a lot of time reading about start-ups, a lot of time hacking, but I'm not quite ready to start my own company. (I have 2 years left of college, and I definitely want to finish), so I'm looking to intern somewhere this summer. <p>Unfortunately I can't find any start-ups around here (NYC, northern new jersey). I know there have to be some in NYC and I would gladly commute but it seems nearly impossible to find them. I assume its because people in a start up are too busy actually doing work to bother posting ads for interns. I watch here and search google and craiglist but the results are not promising. How do you find your way into the loop? I feel like it is a game of who you know, not what you know, and at the moment I don't know anyone. <p>Thanks,\nKevin\nkevinsch@udel.edu",1196125353

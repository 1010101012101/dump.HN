8483861,comment,8477659,8478715,0,0,spb,,,"> Yet the oddly amusing part is how systemd isn&#x27;t difficult to learn. The only valid complaint against systemd IMO is its departure from Unix philosophy, but for some parts of the \*nix ecosystem, I can&#x27;t help but think that boat sailed long ago.<p>This is what I say when people complain that systemd &quot;isn&#x27;t Unix&quot;. Neither are package managers, but I don&#x27;t see anybody saying we should revert to passing around tarballs that unpack onto root (other than Patrick Volkerding).<p>> [...] the easiest way to use the distribution isn&#x27;t to fret over change but to embrace it. Otherwise you&#x27;ll be implementing fragile workarounds that break every time you update.<p>I&#x27;m thinking about putting together a talk about exactly this, tentatively titled &quot;MacGyver-Driven Development&quot;. It&#x27;s my response to people who respond to any criticism with &quot;Yeah, but then you can just put some tools on top of it&quot;: relying on tools only adds another dependency that makes your system more fragile and resistant to change.<p>The proper way to develop is to keep what you do as small and environment-agnostic as possible. That way, when tides do change, you don&#x27;t have to fight them or work hard to embrace them; you can just go with the flow, and just change the few parts that touched the changing dependency.",1413831572

8483836,comment,8482442,8482630,0,0,pjlegato,,,"Hello, Database Labs founder here.<p>Thanks for the feedback. I will be revising the features list shortly to (hopefully) make the unique value proposition clearer based on this and other feedback from this thread.<p>I wrote of some key advantages over RDS at <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8483711"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8483711</a> , which I&#x27;ll soon be incorporating into the website.<p>Heroku suffers from all of the same technical shortcomings listed there since it is also hosted on Amazon EC2 and also runs on EBS network drives. Beyond that, while I like Heroku&#x27;s simplicity and tooling, Heroku is frankly insanely expensive for what you get at all but the lowest pricing tiers. They use this as part of a vendor lock-in based user retention strategy. That is, they make it rather painful to ever get your data out of their system once it&#x27;s on. At the free / low tiers, it seems like a great deal. Then, when your app actually takes off, they ramp up the price very quickly, betting that most people will just pay (because it means their app is becoming successful) rather than bother with jumping through the hoops they set up to get your data out of their system.<p>We believe that the superior long-term business strategy is to build customer trust and develop a reputation for superior customer treatment: your data is yours, and you can take it anywhere you like. We aren&#x27;t going to try to lock you in, we won&#x27;t threaten to incur downtime for your app if you leave, and we believe our prices are much fairer.<p>As for running your own Postgres instance, the non-trivial burden of conducting and testing reliable offsite backups, upgrading Postgres, patching the operating system for security holes and monitoring it for intrusions, and doing other general sysadmin work is then entirely on you. Some people want that level of control, which is fine, but it&#x27;s not free. Our feedback so far indicates that a significant number of Postgres users would much rather pay for that and focus their time and energy on their core app.",1413831322

8483829,comment,8471874,8474220,0,0,deeviant,,,"> For the tracking system you mentioned to protect the rig, do you mean sensors to monitor energy throughput/system temperature/etc.?<p>For any concentrated PV system, you make use of only the direct normal isolation of the sun. All of the optical geometry (must) assume the usable light is coming in normal to the apparatus. Because the sun moves(well because the earth moves really), your apparatus needs to move too, in order to track the sun and maintain the normality of the incoming radiation, any deviation from normal will change the point in which the concentrated light will strike(which in this case is whatever receiver apparatus the rig is using). So the tracking system I am taking about is the apparatus that continuously aims the apparatus at the sun. This is not an easy problem, as you do the math and calc all the angles, but slight imperfections(which we found to be generally non-linear and thus quite hard to calibrate out) in the geometry of the rig, unevenness in terrain and other factors(you would be suprized on how many factors and affect this <wind, a flock of pigions sitting on the device, thermal expansion of the structural components of the rig, etc>).<p>> Do you know if the reported efficiency of quantum dot solar cells is based on input of the entire solar spectrum or from a single frequency? Do you know if multi-junction cells (or a different technology) would convert a laser into electricity more efficiently? As I understood it, multi-junction technology was specifically designed to better handle multiple wavelengths.<p>All reported efficiency of quantum dot solar cells is based on wide-band solar spectrum, since this is the only practical spectrum we have to operate on (
see below).<p>> Achieving a wide-to-single band shift with minimal loss was the mark I was aiming for, and I hope someone figures this out in my lifetime. I&#x27;m curious to see how near or embarrassingly far I was from the target.<p>This actually may be theoretically impossible. As mentioned in my previous response, a discovery that can do this would be a huge advance for a great many fields and applications.<p>> I was taking the &#x27;intellectual philanthropy&#x27; route, but I really am curious to learn my inaccurate assumptions and misconceptions about the idea as well. The first metrics I&#x27;d like to test are the energy lost between the solar radiation input and laser output as well as the amount of loss recuperated by converting the waste heat to electricity or a laser. If the efficiency were not substantially better than directly pumping a NdCrYAG laser with solar radiation, then the idea would not be worth pursuing.<p>My underlying goal with the idea was to reduce the cost of electricity and reduce consumption of fossil fuels to produce electricity simultaneously. Thank you again for your input and your time.<p>Good luck with your continued efforts, my only suggestion would be to focus on one thing at a time, and do due diligence on the assumptions made. It was my pleasure to add my comments, solar power is the energy source of the future and increasingly, it&#x27;s the energy source of today. I&#x27;m always glad to see inquiring minds pondering ways toward pushing the technology forward.<p>P.S.<p>If anybody ever gives you grief for supporting solar, just tell them you are looking into wireless fusion technology, which actually produces more energy than it consumes (which, I might add, is entirely true).",1413831286

PTO was formulated primarily to evade this restriction and to provide the means to reduce the company&#x27;s accounting liabilities.  While it was sold to you on the basis of flexibility, it really is a significant reduction in your benefits.<p>Think about how salary works.  If you work as an exempt salaried employee even one minute during any given week, you are supposed to be paid for the whole week.  That is why vacation time used to be granted as an integral number of weeks.  Converting weeks of vacation into hours of paid time off is simply another step on the slippery slope to treating some salaried workers like wage workers, without any of the additional rights or protections.<p>Also, anecdotally speaking, every time I have experienced the conversion (3 times), new PTO total has been less than old vacation + sick, and it has always resulted in fewer actual days spent on vacation.  The PTO conversion is <i>always</i> the company trying to cut benefit costs quietly without triggering a mass exodus.",1413831213

But it did not seem like Lance was working <i>with</i> IBM so much as he was working <i>for</i> IBM, and that strikes me as something that will be corrected once the integration is better.<p>VPS hosting is a commodity business, and Digital Ocean is driving every penny out of it (they are sort of the Dell of VPS it seems). But the &quot;cloud&quot; is a services and consulting play I believe. A couple of the things I learned at Google was that uniform server design didn&#x27;t work well, but integrated compute and services did. A Gmail cluster was a thing to behold. The challenge is that if you&#x27;re building petabyte and exabyte scale infrastructure you can&#x27;t have your &quot;storage cluster&quot; over here, and your &quot;compute cluster&quot; over there, ever move a petabyte of data over a 10GB link? It takes forever. So your goal has to be to build an API/Services rich environment in a high bandwidth fabric but to ruthlessly use locality as a &quot;feature&quot; in your scheduling.<p>With Softlayer&#x27;s gear, and IBMs resources that is really doable. Remember that IBM is still going to have 12 - 13 billion in free cash flow. So they have the horses to build infrastructure just as fast as Google does (which calls out that expense in their quarterly reports), but IBM also needs the services infrastructure play which is something they are really really good at.

It&#x27;s the same situation we have with startups and VC&#x27;s, the publisher can never be sure if a book by a small author will succeed before it&#x27;s on the market. It&#x27;s always a gamble. So they even those who succeed with those who don&#x27;t.<p>And more important, to many new and more established writers, the editors in publishing houses provide serious value in the form of advice and guidance. It&#x27;s easy to think that because you read books you surely know how to write a good one. But that&#x27;s similar to thinking that because you use applications you surely know how to code a good one.<p>And lastly, good publishing houses serve as brands for consumers. People won&#x27;t see a self-published technology book with the same eyes as if it was published by O&#x27;Reilly (for example). From past experiences they probably feel guaranteed of a certain level of quality from the O&#x27;Reilly book that a small lone author almost never can provide<p>I&#x27;m not claiming that the publishing system is a panacea or that all editors are amazing. But you described it as mostly useless, bordering on a ripoff, and I think it&#x27;s far from the truth.",1413830152

That said, we are acutely aware that significant further tuning specific to a particular database&#x27;s workload can deliver even better performance. We are investigating the best way to deliver this to a broad audience now. Do you have any suggestions?<p>Amazon RDS uses Elastic Block Store (EBS) as its disk. EBS is extremely slow relative to the SSD drives used at DigitalOcean. Worse, unless you buy very expensive provisioned IOPS, you are competing for network bandwidth with all other EC2 customers in the physical network segment where your RDS database is hosted every time you do a disk access. This means your database will randomly become very slow at peak load times, with no visibility and no way to control it other than spending a whole lot of money on provisioned IOPS.<p>We&#x27;ve also gotten good feedback from a number of customers who simply do not want to deal with the complexity of AWS. Our API is far simpler; we don&#x27;t have security groups and so on. If you actually need all that complexity, that&#x27;s fine, but many people don&#x27;t.<p>Finally, RDS does not support read replicas for Postgres (at all); you are limited to one database server.

Yes, you can get a computer mouse shipped to your door in 2 days or less for $7.  But you will also be replacing it in a few months when its cheap microswitch starts randomly double-clicking from a single button press.<p>This, in itself is no big deal.  You got what you paid for, basically.  The danger is when other manufacturers, that formerly had more trustworthy brands, replace their microswitches with the cheaper part, without informing the customer that their build quality has been reduced.  So you can also buy a $60 name-brand mouse that experiences exactly the same failure mode as the $7 item.<p>Then value-based shoppers and cost-based shoppers end up buying exactly the same item, even though the former would dearly love to buy just one mouse that lasts for 10 years rather than 20 that last anywhere from 1 to 24 months each.  Meanwhile, the quality-based shoppers have to pay higher prices for parts that are no longer available at scale.  Or, as is more frequent, they take to the secondary market to buy goods manufactured before the cost-driven breakdown in overall quality.<p>Aggressive cost controls are great for people who always buy the goods with the lowest up-front cost.

Some want full operational control over everything, and others would much rather just have a database to use that&#x27;s always upgraded, monitored, backed up, and so on. Our target market is the latter group.<p>Bear in mind that doing your own sysadmin work for your database is not free. Besides the direct costs of paying someone to do the upgrades, test the backups, and so on, it diverts human time and attention away from other endeavors. Human time is a tech company&#x27;s greatest asset, and we are betting that a significant number of people are prepared to pay someone to handle all of that for them, so they can focus on their core business.<p>> Optimized for what ? Any non-trivial database is going to require tuning, for which there is no one best way - only custom choices.<p>Yes, you are absolutely right. Out of the box, our databases are tuned for what we perceive to be a &quot;generic average web app workload&quot; on the underlying host type that they use.

However, we&#x27;re also starting to see other languages include JS as a target platform; once <i>that</i> matures, those other ecosystems can piggyback on JS&#x27;s features, and it loses much of its appeal.<p>From a computer science/hobby programming perspective, JS is a &#x27;Jack of all trades, master of none&#x27;. If you only know JS, you might get <i>really good</i> at churning out code, debugging language-specific nuances, sculpting libraries to your whim, etc. but I would argue that you <i>won&#x27;t</i> be really good at the big-picture stuff.<p>Without the perspective of multiple paradigms, you might not see the wood for the trees. Your <i>thinking</i> will be a fuzzy mixture of important ideas lost in a sea of JS implementation details; you won&#x27;t have the clarity that comes from thinking about a problem from multiple perspectives.<p>It can be difficult to learn a different technology; especially if it&#x27;s not by your own choice. The key is that, once you&#x27;ve got past the initial &quot;It can&#x27;t even do X, Y and Z!&quot; stage, you&#x27;ll realise that:<p><pre><code>  - It *can* do X, just in a way you didn&#x27;t recognise because you didn&#x27;t fully understand X
  - It can do A, B and C that you never even knew existed
  - Y is actually an anti-feature, which you didn&#x27;t realise the problems of before
</code></pre>
With all that said, if you&#x27;re trying to learn new things, there&#x27;s not much &#x27;bang for your buck&#x27; going from JS/Node to Python/Django, Ruby/Rails, PHP/Symfony, or even whatever Perl&#x27;s up to these days, since those languages are all very similar; of course you&#x27;ll find a few nifty frameworks/approaches which are popular in each, but if you look around on GitHub you&#x27;ll usually find slightly-crappier reimplementations in most of those other languages.<p>If you want to get some real &quot;Aha!&quot; moments, try something out of your comfort zone like Erlang, Haskell, C, FORTH, Prolog, Maude, Scheme, etc. (admitedly JS is like a cheap knock-off of Scheme, but those missing pieces like call-cc, tail-recursion and macros can drastically change the mindset of its users).<p>If you want to get stuff done, stick to what you know ;)",1413829118

(I realized that I have to start from the Hukou policy so that I could tell a reasonable story. Please bear with me.)<p>TL;DR, This is what a train station looks like before Chinese New Year [1].<p>Let&#x27;s start from Hukou policy: Every Chinese is required to register their information to the government and has to provide a permanent address. This looks similar to most other country. But it goes quite far beyond a simple registration. Your Hukou is associated with a permanent address and in many cases, you are only allowed to do many critical things within the city of your permanent address. For example, your child cannot go to the local schools outside their Hukou address. Changing your address on Hukou is very hard and usually happens in some cases: When you go to university, you are allowed to temporarily change your Hukou under the university&#x27;s city; 2. If you found a job in another city and your employer is willing to help you to relocate your Hukou address. 3. You married with a local person for several years. Basically, you can understand Hukou as a domestic visa. There are two types of Hukou: Farmer Hukou and City Hukou. Basically, they have different benefits/restrictions. Similar to F1 visa, H1B visa, etc.<p>Well, why I mention this? Here is some history. 30 years ago, major amount of the Chinese population were farmers. To build cities, you have to let those farmers live in the city and do lots of construction works. Due to the Hukou policy, people are not allowed to permanently migrate, esp. changing their Hukou status from Farmer to City. But there&#x27;s more opportunities in cities and people could make more money. So gradually, there emerges a large group of people whose Hukou address is out of city but work in the cities. Their family has to in their home town, otherwise their children cannot go to school in the cities.<p>Every year, people works outside their home town will try to go back during Chinese New Year. Since the fact I mentioned above, there&#x27;s a huge amount of people. They have to take trains (which is cheaper than flight.) Such yearly migration is quite large, ~3.3B tickets in 2014 [0].<p>Oh, and here is the answer to your question: Go to the train station is really not an option. It&#x27;s like black Friday, but in a much larger scale. People have to wait outside for even weeks to get a ticket. To some extend, online ticket system helps. However, because of the throughput of the train system is limited, it&#x27;s still hard to get a ticket.<p>0. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chunyun"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chunyun</a>

I only ate my own salt-free cooking for about 6 months and I ate a diet high in meat, fish and vegetables. I did not pick up exercise. My BP dropped from 145/90 to 125/80 within the first month. I check my BP weekly and my average BP is 120/75.<p>My parents cook with a lot of salt, I notice this now when I eat at their place. I am confident that the high salt diet they &quot;gave&quot; me for so many years, combined with restaurant food, was the direct cause of my 5 year strugle with high blood pressure.<p>I could be wrong, but I am nonetheless very happy with the results of my diet based solution.",1413828843

The utterly broken way that my team decided to build the reports probably doesn&#x27;t help either.<p>Sorry, no suggestions for books.<p>Do you know if you&#x27;ll be working with Crystal Reports? Or directly with the Business Objects API? Either way they&#x27;re both very, very poorly designed and implemented. Good luck I hope you&#x27;re getting paid well.",1413828106

I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever been able to do that.  Instead of spending my time trying to come up with a fix for a broken system impacting my users, I&#x27;d spend my time contacting someone else in a different company to see if they&#x27;ve come up with a fix for a broken system impacting my users.<p>If you really truly can just punt, sit back, and even get to say &quot;I told you so&quot; when the system/software/service in question doesn&#x27;t work, that&#x27;s great.  But... in almost all cases I&#x27;ve experience, it was still &#x27;my problem&#x27;, I just had far less control over making it work.",1413828103

But if it&#x27;s the result of employers purposefully reducing hours for their employees with the goal of dodging providing benefits, then it&#x27;s a lot less awesome.  Because that means that people are going to both make less money (reduced hours) AND have to pay for health insurance out of pocket (in the exchanges).  It&#x27;s a double-whammy that might cause people to forego coverage; the exact opposite effect of what was intended.",1413828096

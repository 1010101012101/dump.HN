Building anything in this country costs massively more (and takes significantly longer) than one could imagine because of our unions are not business symbiotic. The goal of union leadership is to extract as much as they can out of the businesses they infect, even if this means their demise.<p>Musk is in the car industry, one of the hardest hurt by unions and their ilk, so I would find it hard to believe that he didn&#x27;t take that into account.<p>> Finally, it addresses the wrong market. I am not sure why people insist on applying trains to transporting people in the US. Sorry to resort to reality folks: If you build it they will NOT come. We do not have that culture and you will not inspire it simply by building trains.<p>Again, Musk is building and selling electric cars in a country that LOVES gas guzzlers.

6203524,comment,6201243,6201243,2,0,zissou,,,"I&#x27;d encourage any economist that has a knack for programming to really put in some time towards the area. I&#x27;ve owned econpy.org for about 3 years now (although I haven&#x27;t updated it in a long time). I also own economics.io and run econpy.blogspot.com.<p>It&#x27;s much easier (relatively speaking) for an economist to pick up some programming than it is for a programmer to pick up some economics. Economists are already familiar with the types of questions that are important to economists, and more importantly, how to frame them. The trouble with economics is that you can&#x27;t just pick it up overnight as it is a way of thinking more than it is a tool set. Programming on the other hand is something that you can &quot;get working&quot; overnight (economic programmers don&#x27;t need to be algorithmic theorists -- they just need to be really good at getting/scraping data and organizing it so they can run analyses on it).<p>Over a year ago, I dropped out of my PhD program in economics because I was not at a school that was going to allow me to do the econ/cs type work I was working on. Leaving my PhD program was one the best things I ever did because it has allowed me to pursue whatever I want to do with the skills I&#x27;ve acquired.<p>The problem with academic economics is that the data most economists use is so bad and outdated -- such as data from FRED, BLS, and other publicly available sources where everyone and their uncle can download the same CSV dataset that was aggregated by some government employee. The race then is to see who can put together the most elegant econometric model to handle all the issues with the data. The rules of the game change when you create your own dataset and thus have control over while variables to include, the aggregation, the frequency, etc.<p>Long story short, if you are an economist wanting to do programming, learn to adapt those skills in academia (best way is to find a great advisor -- if there isn&#x27;t one in your economics department, check the business school as bschool professors are often much more open to highly empirical analyses and care [marginally] less about getting the theory perfect). Or, if you want an easier lifestyle that is much more rewarding, ditch academia for the private sector. You&#x27;ll find the economists in the private sector to be much more knowledgeable about cutting edge technologies and willing to listen and learn from what you have to say.",1376358274

I didn&#x27;t downmod you though and i wouldn&#x27;t have even if i had the karma. Negative stereotypes regarding aspergers are too prevalent to really blame on individuals at this point.<p>I agree with you about the world not <i>necessarily</i> being entirely rational. I see rationality as a subjective position from which to perceive reality. Another is the self and its intrinsic interests. This is where I seem to fail in my communication with others. This may be a wildly arrogant assertion but I think most people are insanely self obsessed. From this I can understand why empathy is seen as being absolutely necessary. Frankly, I think most people with autism spectrum disorders actually lack the self obsession that would normally be redirected onto others via empathy. This causes a failure to appropriately acknowledge others and with tragic irony a typical individual will ascribe their behavior to self-obsession. Anyway, you mention the learning acquired from considering others points of view. The thought process I&#x27;ve found most rewarding in this regard is to first build up the person&#x27;s opinion as much as I can and then to attack any weaknesses. The attack is intended to elicit a defense which I cannot conceive. The ultimate aim being to fully understand their position and its legitimacy. Needless to say, this often becomes unpleasant. Likely stemming from my pathological lack of tact :(. The important thing to note is that there are people (at least one person) who are detail oriented.

6203509,comment,6196334,6199150,1,0,oblique63,,,"I actually generally agree with your assessment here. Modern things that are generally labeled as &#x27;philosophy&#x27; and <i>only</i> &#x27;philosophy&#x27; are rather abstract and with very little clarity as to their usefulness. Most of the useful philosophical ideas were indeed established back before science was fully autonomous, but even as recently as the works of sir Karl Popper (1902-1994; the father of the idea that scientific theories must be &#x27;falsifiable&#x27;) have had a very noticeable influence in the sciences. What&#x27;s important to note however, is that Popper&#x27;s writings were much more practical and grounded down to the <i>act</i> and <i>methods</i> of science, than any of the writings of Plato ever were for example. And that&#x27;s really the point I&#x27;m getting at; philosophy has shifted more from being a useful &#x27;subject&#x27;, to being a useful <i>approach</i>. The art of philosophical argumentation and elaboration of ideas is still very much relevant and useful as it ever was, it&#x27;s just going to be finding it&#x27;s niches in more and more applied areas, to the point where people will forget they&#x27;re even discussing philosophy.<p>Any major breakthroughs in philosophy are almost certainly going to come from philosophically-minded specialists  (e.g. scientists/engineers/politicians/linguists/mathematicians/etc) in the future. But just because it doesn&#x27;t carry the big overarching label of <i>&quot;philosophy&quot;</i> doesn&#x27;t mean that it is not. I mean, the definition of philosophy itself is so vague, that you could say that it is simply the byproduct of any exploration that uses philosophical tools (e.g. formal logic/logical fallacies), so it really doesn&#x27;t go against what you&#x27;re saying at all.<p>I agree that if all one&#x27;s doing now is studying philosophy, and philosophy only, it&#x27;s gonna be hard to contribute anything terribly useful to society (unless you can get a job as a historian). But the <i>tools</i> that philosophy gives us should never be discarded because they are ultimately the atomic building blocks that let us know whether we&#x27;re on the right track or not, and thus, <i>thinking philosophically</i> is of critical importance. And <i>that</i> is where philosophy is now. It is not a field of it&#x27;s own, it is scattered throughout several other fields, but the art is still very much in tact. It this bad misconception that gives philosophy these lazy/useless/idealist connotations. And that is unfortunate, because there is much people can learn from thinking philosophically, that they do not (unfortunately) seem to gain just from thinking &#x27;scientifically&#x27;. I&#x27;m going to blame this on training/education rather than the designation of the field itself, since science <i>should</i> teach how to think critically, but the practice of this does not seem to extend beyond the student&#x27;s specific/applied area from my experience. Philosophy helps here because the whole point of it is to train a person&#x27;s <i>entire outlook</i> to process information critically, rather than only apply that approach to certain specific/narrow areas.<p>tl;dr: Philosophy is the mathematical language of reason, and good reasoning skills should be important for everybody. However, <i>applied</i> philosophy within specific domains (e.g. ethics/math/politics/etc) is likely to be the only way we will continue to make more philosophical advancements in the future. Arguing that we don&#x27;t need philosophy anymore because now we have science, is like arguing that we don&#x27;t need math anymore because now we have programming; both are important in their own specialized ways because of the <i>approaches</i> they allow.",1376358030

Besides, why should we be deducing anything when there is actual video?<p>><i>If the video evidence was so clear that he was travelling 35MPH, I&#x27;m sure other people would be supporting this claim</i><p>That&#x27;s an odd position to take.

The idea sounds very interesting and I&#x27;d rather spend sixty billion building a Hyperloop --even if it fails-- than the ridiculous California high speed rail project.<p>Cost is probably off by an order of magnitude, if not more.  Why? Unions and other groups.  Building anything in this country costs massively more (and takes significantly longer) than one could imagine because of our unions are not business symbiotic.  The goal of union leadership is to extract as much as they can out of the businesses they infect, even if this means their demise.<p>A lot of the unions that would be part of such a project have some of the laziest and most problematic people working for them.  If you come from the Silicon Valley tech world my words make no sense to you.  In fact, you might think I am nuts.  All I have to say is:  Do a good size trade show exhibit at a few of the unionized convention centers in the US and then see what you think about US unions.  Then repeat that experience at various locations in Europe and Japan and see the difference.  I have done just that.  US labor unions are destroying our country from the inside out.<p>How many significant new civil engineering projects in the US can you name over the last, say, fifty years.  Right.<p>Hyperloop cost would be way more than this paper seems to predict.<p>The political factor is grossly underestimated.  Our reality is that we live at a time of political deadlock.  Nobody can or wants to make a decision and the decisions we do make tend to be suboptimal, sometimes grotesquely so: example, California high speed rail.<p>Finally, it addresses the wrong market.  I am not sure why people insist on applying trains to transporting people in the US.  Sorry to resort to reality folks:  If you build it they will NOT come.  We do not have that culture and you will not inspire it simply by building trains.  You&#x27;d have to forcefully push people in that direction through legislation that would make it too expensive to not use rail.  In other words you&#x27;d have to declare war against other methods of transportation through punitive actions.<p>The right place for high speed rail in the US is cargo, not passenger rail.  If we could evolve our cargo rail systems to move at 300 km/hr rather than 50 the consequences would provide economic benefits and development beyond a century.<p>The final point is related to politics.  We have a decision making system that allows anyone to vote.  And, while this is commendable, it does create horrible problems.  Imagine allowing a random group of, say, ten people deciding whether or not your child should have surgery.  I&#x27;d be surprised if anyone thought this to be a good idea.  No, most people would rather have a group of experts in the field, more than likely MD&#x27;s in this case, vote for such a decision.  The ridiculous California high speed rail project is a result of hordes of low-information, mathematically challenged, technologically ignorant and financially ignorant voters being led by the nose by unions, media and political forces.<p>How do you move forward when people like that can vote on these issues and their vote has equal value to that of an expert in the relevant fields: a PhD in Physics, an engineer, a financial expert, etc.<p>Regrettably this is not a technological problem.  It is far more complex than that.",1376357403

Gladwell:<p>a) Doesn&#x27;t make the 10,000-hour figure a <i>rule</i> as both Epstein and Repanich would have us believe.<p>b) Fully concedes that there are myriads of other factors that have an effect on how one reaches &quot;expert status&quot;.<p>I&#x27;m also not sure how Epstein can claim that the chess master study is somehow disanalogous with the athlete one. An expert athlete might have some physical advantage over your &quot;average Joe&quot;: speed, lean muscle, endurance, height, etc., etc. Similarly, one can say that an expert chess player may have some neurophysiological advantage over the &quot;average Joe&quot;: better-formed synaptic pathways, higher attention span, etc., etc. I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any difference between an expert chess master or an NFL quarterback.<p>Both might have some genetic advantage; both have trained extensively. The idea behind Gladwell&#x27;s figure is not that you can practice X for 10,000 hours and then you will instantly be an expert at it, but merely that after 10,000 hours (of deliberate practice plus a number of contingencies) you can expect to be somewhere in the realm of expertness.<p>There are plenty of other studies that favor this hypothesis; in particular, some very interesting double-blind identical twin studies[1].<p>Outside of extreme cases (e.g. I am 4&#x27;11&#x27;&#x27; and want to play in the NBA; I have an IQ of 90 and want to be an astronaut), I think Gladwell is right on the money: practice is more important than talent.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.indiana.edu/~jkkteach/P335/shanks_expertise.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.indiana.edu/~jkkteach/P335/shanks_expertise.html</a>",1376357075

But most companies never benefit from their love of innovation, because they are beaten down by soft strategies, weak tools, and squishy communication. This leads to mistrust, frustration and anger. And that&#x27;s too bad because creating great software is invigorating.

I&#x27;ve mainly been working on sites in php and .net, though I&#x27;d really like to learn something that will contribute to my future career options and allow me to expand my portfolio.
It seems like everyone on hacker news loves python, ruby or node, so I&#x27;d like to have a go at a larger project with one of them, I&#x27;m just being indecisive with hosting (I also have about zero cash, so the cheapest hosting would be preferable).",1376355915

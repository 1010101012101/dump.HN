593836,comment,593286,593286,0,0,yason,,,"So PSD is undeniably an incoherent piece of legacy crap. What's so wrong with that that Adobe/Adobeans feel they have to explain themselves - do they feel ashamed somehow? All that is needed is to just accept that it's far from perfect. It doesn't mean it's wrong or they're stupid or whatever.<p>Many old formats are crap; heck, you might even expect any old format to be crap in a way or another! You can only write a clear, consistent format specification after the fact when you know everything the format needs to capture.<p>Even if the basic structure is simple, such as in XML or AVI/RIFF, developers only proceed to write hacky extensions in terms of that very basic structure. The complexity just arises on a higher level, then.",1241513259
593835,comment,593805,593830,0,0,swombat,,,"I have to reiterate the grandparent poster's point... The tactics you used might be great to generate buzz in one week, but they would suck to generate buzz over 6 months, because once everyone finds you're basically abusing forums for your SEO, lying to journalists, and spamming twitter, they won't want to deal with you on principle.<p>So this works for a throw-away company that you don't care about. That said, I'm doubtful of the wisdom of linking your name to it publicly like this. You only have one reputation...",1241512952

I'm not telling entrepreneurs to market their products in a sham-wow way. I wrote that in an attempt to inspire entrepreneurs by letting them know that all they need are the tools they are given and their creativity to generate buzz. This was mostly a response to the submissions I've seen in the past where people complain about how hard it is to get attention for their product. That SEO is still worth something. That Twitter can prove to be an invaluable tool. And that creating an interesting story is the way to get blogged.<p>I'm not trying to build the next Apple, man. This was clearly a gimmick I whipped up in no time and tried to push to the limit given the resources I have and no money.<p>Also, in response to your last line, PlentyofFish comes to mind.",1241512773

I certainly would not have done that if I was trying to generate buzz for a legitimate company.

I guess that includes URL obfuscation.<p>A bit cheeky I guess. First screw around with ABP, then write a apologetic blog post about it, get it on HN and Reddit and use the same technique to display the Ads. Wonder how many ad impressions he got out of it. The only problem, I dont think anyone uses ABP is going to click the ads even if you manage to show it to them!",1241512195

Can you please tell me why the last sentence in your article says you made a nice sum of cash, instead of listing a dollar figure?<p>Call me a cynic, but I'd guess that the dollar amount you made would have seriously detracted from the veracity of your article. Maybe after Forbes covers your shirts, the figure will be worth sharing...<p>In the mean time, let me offer some words of advice to the entrepreneurs who might be misled by this article. The way to a successful product isn't a sham-wow with a trendy swine flu t-shirt site - the way to success is to focus on serving your users, and making your product better.<p>Tell me... did Posterous get to the level of success it has today with the tactics of making swine flu shirts?

I will never understand people who think ""I don’t like something so it should be taken down""<p>The web and blogs in particular provide a system for documenting different perspectives.  So even if someone is wrong their post provides insight into why people believe something that is incorrect.

By definition it's a platform and should stay neutral about what is allowed and what is not. While the Mozilla platform is indeed more integrated and monolithic than, for example, an operating system, it's still an application platform.<p>All platforms have applications. Could you imagine GNU or Gnome setting policies for how different programs shouldn't mess and compete with each other? In an open market for applications, the bad applications just get weeded out for good. There's no need for Mozilla to intervene; the power of Mozilla platform is that extensions can do powerful stuff, upto and including battling each other. You can't go rule out just those things.<p>* * *<p>(Or are we in for a lengthy philosophical debate of whether it's possible to write a platform that only allows ""good"" things to happen?

Right now I buy books used through Amazon but never sell them. Usually the used books are about 20-60% of list price on Amazon and 60-80% at a local book store. I don't imagine that publishers would be willing to drop the price of an ebook 20+% to make them competitive.<p>Though some of the initial markup on textbooks is due to reselling in the first place (which the publishers combat with useless new editions), maybe eliminating resale would allow some publishers to lower their price and for people who never sell the books again like myself it would be a great win.",1241510523

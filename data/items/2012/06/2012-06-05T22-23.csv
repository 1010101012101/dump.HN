The street is approximately 1 mile long.

If that's too extreme, I'd still gladly put up your 100 calories of olive oil (a few spoonfuls) against my 100 calories of white rice (a small bowl) for satiety and fullness.<p>Different macronutrients stimulate hormones differently, so I'm not saying that macronutrient composition doesn't play a role in these matters, only that those effects are mostly irrelevant if you don't go overboard. For example, high GI and low GI foods have virtually identical glycemic loads when consumed alongside a lean protein like chicken breast (GI is measured by feeding food to a subject after a 12-hour fast), so even if you accept that insulin is the master regulator of fat storage (which is out of date nonsense that Taubes can't get out of his head), it still wouldn't matter appreciably so long as you eat your carbs alongside your fiber and protein.<p>> The pizza example you give is basically wrong.<p>I was going by the pizza recipe I usually make at home, which per slice has 200 calories from fat and 100 from carbs.",1338936100

By drawing on current trends, authors can extrapolate a future. The cyberpunk aesthetic arose around the same time as the personal computer, early Internet, 80's corporate greed, continuing urban sprawl, the Japanese economic bubble leading to property purchases all over the world, etc. -- inspiration for many themes that appear in cyberpunk works. Many of these things have cased to be novel (in the same way) or exist at all. For instance, computers and connectivity is ubiquitous now, massive conglomerate corporations haven't totally taken over for governments (depending on who you ask, at least), China has somewhat replaced Japan, and the world has moved on. Unless they were just writing genre fiction, authors like Gibson would not keep cyberpunk going because the world today is very different from the one that spawned it.<p>Another thought is to compare it to the other famous ""-punk"" style, steampunk. Steampunk benefits from the fact that all the technological foundation (steam, mechanical, analog) it is based on exists. I'd argue that the genre can thrive because a well-defined foundation exists from which to create. With cyberpunk, some of the foundations exist (computer hacking and espionage), but many are still left as future speculation (synthetic organs, cybernetic implants). It becomes harder to have a consistent foundation when there are still moving targets. I guess we can still have trench coats and mirror shades ;)<p>I really enjoy the cyberpunk aesthetic, and I wish it had more of a footprint in current music/film/TV.

The Civil Service Commission extends spousal benefits and pensions to the partners of homosexual employees. The Israeli State Attorney's Office has extended the spousal exemption from property-transfer taxes to same-sex couples. Israel's attorney general has granted legal recognition to same-sex couples in financial and other business matters. Attorney General Meni Mazuz said the couples will be treated the same as common-law spouses, recognizing them as legal units for tax, real estate, and financial purposes. Mazuz made his decision by refusing to appeal a district court ruling in an inheritance case that recognized the legality of a same-sex union, his office said in a statement. Mazuz did differentiate, however, between recognizing same-sex unions for financial and practical purposes, as he did, and changing the law to officially sanction the unions, which would be a matter for parliament, according to the statement.</i><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_rights_in_Israel#Recognition_of_same-sex_relationships"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_rights_in_Israel#Recogniti...</a>",1338935369

For instance, in Diablo II a high level item would give +20 vitality. Your character got 5 stat points per level which you could, if you wanted, put all into vitality. This high level item was roughly equivalent to only 4 character levels (of which you got 99).<p>In Diablo III, a high-level item is giving you 200+ vitality. I don't know about other characters, but I believe my Monk is getting 2 vitality per level (and there are 60 levels). A _single_ item can give me more of a stat than I gain from leveling all the way from 1 to 60. As such, leveling up doesn't do much other than allow equip items with better stats.<p>Because items in Diablo II gave, comparatively, closer benefits to gaining another level than those in Diablo III, I felt like I was making progress with either a level up or a nice item drop. If my character was getting decimated in Act IV of Nightmare, I could go back and gain a few levels and maybe get some new items in the process. In Diablo III, not only do your levels not increase your survivability or killing power in any way (besides new skill runes), by the time you feel like you aren't strong enough to defeat an encounter you'll most likely have few or even no more levels left to gain.

There's nothing unique about carbs in that regard. I can barely put away a 1000-calorie meal with an equal amount of calories from chicken breast and white rice (100+ grams of carbs just from the rice). Putting away the same amount of calories split between chicken breast and greens would be almost physically impossible--I ate a whole pound of grilled asparagus with my chicken breast on Sunday, and the asparagus barely amounted to 100 calories. But I can easily put away a 2000-calorie pepperoni pizza with extra cheese. If you think carbs are the calorically-dominant macronutrient in that pizza, think again. I'm not blaming the fat either.

Or rice and potatoes for that matter? Eating pounds of lean protein sources like tuna and chicken breast won't make you full?<p>> The idea is carbs keep you hungry because of energy partiioning and so you over consume calories because you feel hungrier than you should.<p>That isn't borne out by the evidence. The demonization of one macronutrient over another is baffling. If you subsist on calorically dense processed foods that are purposefully engineered to be high in palatability then you are more likely to overeat. Carbs aren't the problem. Neither is fat; dietary fat is very calorically dense, so it's easy to get lots of ""hidden"" calories from it, but that's the main downside from a weight loss perspective.<p>It's not as simple as X is good, Y is bad.",1338934142

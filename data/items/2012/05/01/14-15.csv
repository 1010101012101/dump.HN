Is it the fear of seeming foolish?  It's like someone getting angry that I don't care about gold, yea it's shinny and yellow, but that's about it.  Does that harm you?<p>Note: I am suggesting that the law needs to change or anything, just that I don't understand why people think in that fashion.",1335884382

Privacy"", it's not just the network you're on, you're protecting your privacy from, it's every single service your device regularly polls or connects to. If you find yourself hopping on and off wifi at home and work and else where, every service your device polls is building up a log of your movements.<p>This is mainly why I have a VPN on my phone. Apps that make internet connections from my phone always appear to be coming from the same IP address as far as the end service is concerned. It doesn't matter if I'm on wifi at home, on wifi at work, or on 3G. All of the connections are routed over an encrypted channel to a box I control before hitting the Internet.",1335884372

I am working on Live Post <a href=""http://livepost.in"" rel=""nofollow"">http://livepost.in</a> using ASP.Net MVC/jQuery/jQuery Mobile/MySQL/MongoDB/Dapper(ORM). Just replace ASP.Net MVC/Dapper with django and it will become a common stack used by alot of startups these days. Also from cost point of view the difference is very minimal - I am running it on a 1GB VPS which at my host costs just 2.95$ extra per month compared to a linux VPS with similar specs. I use Visual Web Developer 2010 express edition IDE for development which is pretty good in terms of features and is free. So its just a matter of perception nothing else.",1335884336

Yes, please.<p>Company B could have just as much potential for growth as company A. Sure A has the potential to have more brand evangelists bringing in new customers but B has more time to devote to totally babying their 10 customers and making sure they will be likely to recommend the product/service to others in their industry. Company B only needs 1 referral to make another $1,000 per month whereas company A would need 100 referrals.<p>Also think about upselling down the road, if a company can afford $1,000/mo for your base product they will probably be willing and able to pay for upgrades that will make their work easier or more efficient.<p>I'm not arguing that B is better than A, but I think that B could have just as much growth with less stress.",1335884313

It is perfectly legitimate to ask users to use a different browsers if they are on an old browser.<p>The best way to decide wether to spend time debugging or just screw it would to be ask yourself a couple of questions.<p>How much of the user base will be using old browsers? Think if your user base is mostly geeks / people at home or non-technichal / people using school or work computers (with locked-down policies for downloading software)<p>Can you spend less time on older browsers and make it gracefully degrade without losing functionality? If your website looks less beatiful on an older browser but the functionality still works, you can put a warning stating that the website will look better if the user changes browser, but that no functionality is changed.<p>Can you postpone this debugging to later? Maybe you should focus on launching your product first and once you're mostly satisfied with what you have, your spend time debugging old browsers.

Ruby on Rails + jQuery stack, 12-ish person engineering team, the usual startup perks (catering, snacks, soda, etc), gym membership reimbursement, etc. Ways we're trying to make ourselves better engineers:<p>- deliberate practice with our tools. If you are a vim user, we have the programmer who wrote Command-T on staff and he's a great person to learn from - every changeset gets pushed to Gerrit where it waits to get a +1 from our build suite (that runs in 3 minutes) and a +1 from a human reviewer<p>- last month I said we were hoping to finish our Rails 3.0.11 upgrade soon. I'm happy to announce that not only have we landed on 3.2.3, but we needed some upstream patches to get our site working -- so we're on bleeding edge Rails. We're the largest site I know of on Rails 3.2. Come get your SASS on!<p>- everyone is encouraged to take one hour from their day to learn about something they wouldn't otherwise<p>- every story is scoped so that it can be completed in less than a day. We don't branch, we just work on top of master. We've found that the closer we stay to master, the less needless work we create for ourselves<p>Causes is a great place to better yourself and better the world.

It reminds me of searching for music in the very very early days of Napster... No, wait... Napster was better. I can't search for albums very well, I can't sort the results, I can't distinguish between a good quality song an a shitty quality song often. Especially noticeable when search a song name and getting a live track instead of studio track.<p>3) Something as simple as ""Shuffle"" never showed up. I hated having to manually shuffle my list of music. Usually I'd add entire albums at once... but I didn't want to listen to all the songs in order.<p>4) Starting a room is frustrating because you can't listen to music by yourself. There is no way to grow a new room from me, by myself, to 100 if I can't listen. I'll simply leave the room.<p>5) Needs a DJ recommendation service or something.

All that, and the money so-and-so accumulates gets saved in a way that makes it available for loans which in turn are spent on goods and services, which creates jobs, etc. etc.<p>However, the ""job creators"" rhetoric is carefully focused on a micro scale, very much in order to avoid the way such things tend to disappear once you allow all that interconnectedness to be considered. Cutting out as many complicating factors as possible also makes it more appropriate for the 'sound bites' rhetorical arena in which it operates.  Such an argument can't be challenged by just wildly throwing a list of nuances at it. Nuance doesn't work there; it'd be like trying to use incendiary weapons in an underwater fight.

The problem, however, is that if you build an HTML5/CSS3 Responsive website from scratch you inevitably end up spending a great deal of time putting in hacks just to get things working somewhat similar in IE 8 (which doesn't support a large number of the new standards coming out now). To give an example, I spent over 5 hours yesterday working on a silly image overlay issue because of the weird way that IE 8 handles z-index. If you have the resources, of course it makes sense to build in some type of support for such a large number of users, but if you at a small startup where there is very little time for anything shouldn't you focus on the 90%? I know BaseCamp is doing this with their latest version, but is it crazy to force the use of alternative browsers? Is the huge effort needed to make things easy for that 10% worth it?",1335882911

ISPs are governed by different laws ensuring your privacy (to some extent). VPNs aren't subjected to those laws and can thus, legally, sell you out long before your ISP ever could. Sure, the potential outrage for such behavior is probably enough to convince most VPN services to never do it (although a secret agreement with MPAA or similar is probably tempting for many) - but you get <i>no</i> extra protection against the law.<p>Since the moment someone has a warrant against you both the VPN and your ISP are obligated to cooperate you really have nothing to gain, in theory, from using a VPN in order to pirate.<p>There is one exception and that is if your VPN resides in a different country, then filing a warrant is probably trickier but with time this hole will probably be a lot smaller (at least within countries of EU etc.).

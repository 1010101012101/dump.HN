128108,comment,127711,128065,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"As anecdotal evidence, some of the worst parents (in my opinion) are those who are committed to being something other than themselves. They try so hard! Whatever the book they're reading, they imitate it almost exactly. They preach it to other parents and they look down their noses at the poor uneducated who haven't found their superior knowledge.<p>Until the day comes when they've had a bad week, the kid is grouchy, life is bad, etc. Then wham! You got some parent wailing on their child (either emotionally or with corporeal punishment) What does that teach children? Mommy's so inept she needs a book to tell her how to act, and in reality she can't hold it together?<p>I'd much rather just be myself. If you get angry -- get angry. Kids have to learn to live with angry people from time to time. If you feel grumpy, be grumpy. Geesh. We act like we're raising kids to live in some kind of world that doesn't exist. It just seems way too easy to lose track of common sense, that's all.",1204559758

Or slowly trying to catch up and a few years behind?  A program like this could have a few kids say 'Hey! lets check out Arc, pg says its cool!' and learn a new way of looking at programming.<p>I am moderately angry my alma mater didn't have this in place when I went.  However, I think it would be a great dorm to visit, not to live in.  My priorities were not the same during those years.<p>Waterloo is really turning into a startup hub, but RIM's aggressive hiring lately has turned most of my entrepreneur friends in the area into drones!",1204559419
128105,comment,127711,128071,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"I was being somewhat rhetorical. But only somewhat. Your statement that ""We don't magically know how to raise children"" I find to be very interesting. How then, do we learn how to raise children? Certainly parenting is indeed built into the species, as it is in every other species.<p>I would not go so far as to ban any learning at all, only to understand that there is a financial motive in people giving you advice from self-help books. New parents are nervous, worried about doing the right thing. This is exactly as it should be. In response to this worry the free market provides us with lots of ""security blankets"" in the form of books and advice to make us feel like we have nothing to worry about. The odd side-effect to this is that people reading different books feel the _other_ people are all full of tripe. Let the baby cry. Don't let the baby cry. Spank the kid. Don't ever spank the kid! Nurture children. Teach children self-reliance. Discipline. Self-exploration.<p>These are somewhat contradictory to say the least. Here's an idea: when presented with lots of self-contradictory information, look at nature. Nature is neither good nor bad, nor is it necessarily optimized for modern life. But it certainly has worked for eons. Must be something of value going on in there. In fact, I lean towards trusting genetic learning over self-promotion any day.<p>My opinion only. YMMV. Do not operate heavy machinery while raising your child.",1204559385

Digital hardware is kinda ""easy"" developpment that can be done much cheaper in eastern europe or asia.

My point was that spanking creates a visceral aversion to a behavior that is immediate and very different from a reasoned response. There is no ""last time I did this I got spanked and so I don't think I'll do it again"" thought process, only an automatic nervous response that associates built in pain avoidance with an action.<p>I'm not here to say when or how much spanking is appropriate. This is for each parent to decide for themselves. I'm just saying that it can and does work where reason fails, and if used appropriately and with discretion, its not the soul-draining horror some alarmists make it out to be.",1204558207

If you learn a framework you won't be so much exposed to the real technologies - HTTP, HTML, CSS, Javascript.  I think I'd start by reading the RFCs for those.

128087,comment,127675,127877,0,0,dkokelley,,,"If the company already has about 10-15 employees, you're not looking at much equity left, assuming that the other employees get the same you do. If 2 founders and 10 employees got equal amounts, you would be looking at 8.3% per person, and if there were 17 people total (15 + 2 founders, not including you) that puts the company at 5.9% per person.<p>This is just a starting point, You have to assume that the founders have the lion's share of the equity, and that the amount of equity per additional employee trends downward the later the employee joined. It could be that the company only has 5% equity left for future employees, and so they have to offer only a small percentage of the equity. In any case, try to see what they have available, and again, offer to take only a token salary if anything in return for a greater equity share.<p>Good luck!",1204557404

128079,comment,127675,127914,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I think the chance of a ""decent payout after spending 4 years of your life"" is smaller than you expect, for both founders and employees.<p>I thought/think much the same as you, which is why I'm founding my own startup after working for 3 years at 2 other ones.  I had similar equity offers as you - 0.1% at one startup, none at the second (and an offer of 0.02% at a third that I turned down).  I used to think that employees were insane for taking a straight salary instead of a shot at a big payout.  After 5 months working full-time on my own startup with no salary, I'm not entirely sure.  Obviously I think that on-balance the startup bargain is more appealing, else I'd go get a job, but I also think the scales are much more even than I'd initial thought.<p>If you do take a job at the startup, take it to learn, not to get rich.  You won't get rich.  80-90% of startups fail outright and nobody gets anything, other than whatever venture money was paid out in salaries.  If it does succeed, you won't get rich with an employee's option grant, unless the startup <i>really</i> hits it big (like, Google or Microsoft-sized).  One of my coworkers worked at a startup that was bought for $42M - he ended up with $3000.  I do know someone else that ended up with a multi-million-$ payout as employee #35, but she was a VP and the company in question was Stratus, which momentarily had a billion-$ market cap.  She ended up losing much of it when Stratus stock crashed anyway.<p>If you do go the founder route, do it for meaning and not for money.  It has to be something you'd want to do anyways, regardless of whether there's a huge payout attached.  Because from 5 months in, that huge payout looks pretty remote.  (I wish I'd paid more attention to webwright's advice on tractability, in another comment thread.)<p>On a side note, I always wondered why some startups are so stingy with equity.  If you give out big-company equity awards, you get big-company effort.  And if the people who are actually doing the work are putting in big-company effort levels, how do you expect to catch the big companies?  The conclusion I reached is that the startup should have product-market fit <i>before</i> hiring people, so that success is just a matter of crossing Ts and dotting Is, but neither of the startups I've worked at were at that point.  (And sure enough, one failed outright and the other is sorta walking-dead: profitable but not growing, with a pretty narrow customer base.)",1204556548

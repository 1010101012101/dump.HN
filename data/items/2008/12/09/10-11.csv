391179,comment,391080,391167,0,0,bdfh42,,,"Agreed. The suggestion is (and this does not differ widely from my all too long experience in such matters) that the only valid evaluation is ""How does someone perform in the job?""<p>Is it therefore implied that we should hire on criteria that is not task specific (like will someone's personality fit in with the team) and then be prepared to fire them quickly if they don't work out?<p>The problem is that hiring is a lengthy process - we are all adverse to the idea of it becoming a continual process.",1228820337

The flag manifold, she notes, in addition to providing mathematicians with pure joy, also happens to be useful to physicists in solving some of the mathematical problems that arise in dealing with quarks, tiny particles that are the building blocks of protons and neutrons. And she does not believe the manifold's presence both in the mathematics of quarks and in the dance of honeybees is a coincidence. Rather she suspects that the bees are somehow sensitive to what's going on in the quantum world of quarks, that quantum mechanics is as important to their perception of the world as sight, sound, and smell.""",1228819088

391163,comment,389401,390791,0,0,cousin_it,,,"<i>However, your complaint seems not to be about closures or shared activation objects per se, but rather about the lack of block-level scope.</i><p>Bingo, reread my first comment.<p><i>If closures ""trapped"" outer values at their current state, then no matter how you called thing.set(), it would always return ""foo"" from thing.get().</i><p>No I don't want hyper-static environments, this would preclude the very useful encoding of objects with mutable state as closures.<p><i>Since ""j"" is created inside a set of braces, you seem to suggest that there ought to be multiple ""j"" variables created... every ""while"", ""for"", ""switch"", ""if"", and ""else"" would have to create an activation object, which would get quite expensive and complicated.</i><p>Do you think Ocaml heap-allocates a frame for every scope entered? How is it about as fast as C++, then? :-) Activation frames would need to be created for only those blocks that directly construct closures, findable by simple static analysis. Almost all other languages with closures do precisely this.<p>As a rule, the introduction of lexical scope doesn't make languages perceptibly slower. For example, the historical transition of Lisps from dynamic to lexical scope was accompanied by fears very similar to yours, and Scheme played a major role in convincing people that lexical scope worked fast. Modern Scheme compilers are quite clever at eliminating unneeded activation frames and closures, sometimes even converting closures into inline code. It's a well-researched topic. (See <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/thist.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/thist.html</a>, a great retrospective by one of the best implementers... search for ""tied up"" for an amusing paragraph about exactly this. The year was 1982, I was busy being born.)<p>And to reiterate my point from another comment, all code that relies on function scope could be converted to a hypothetical lexically-scoped-JavaScript by a trivial transformation: move every var declaration to the toplevel of the containing function (which coincides nicely with Crockford's advice). This demonstrates that function scope is not more useful than lexical in any practical sense.<p>In short, I know how JavaScript works, I know how it could work differently, and I consider the different way superior both in theory and in practice.",1228817849

It would be an optional service, so you would only use it if you wanted to. (Unless gov't got involved somehow, but my whole point is that they shouldn't be involved.) If it were a gov't run operation it would probably be impossible to opt out of. A recent example is the Australian filter. That's not working out very well, neither would this.<p>B. A private company has more to lose if it were to screw up implementation and design than the gov't would. I would trust my privacy to a company before the gov't because I could weigh customer reviews and go to a competitor's service if it was better.<p>C.

8201139,comment,8199323,8200646,1,0,conorgil145,,,"Fair points. I guess I struggle to see the benefit as a user. I just glanced at their site and they do list a few benefits for users including &quot;fast and easy payment, perks and rewards for using Kash, manage spending better with daily limits, no bank fees or interest charges&quot;. These could be interesting, but as a user I don&#x27;t know that the incentives are there for me to stop using my CC which I am already accustomed to. I get points from CC purchases, use Mint to set budgets, and do not see bank fees or interest charges because I pay each month in full. I guess I am just not the target market for Kash.<p>However, I clearly see the many benefits for the retailer. They are saving money on transaction fees, avoid charge backs (maybe?), get paid more quickly, and is free for businesses charging under $100k.<p>I think in the back of my mind when I posted my previous comment was the classic chicken-and-the egg problem. Lots of benefits for retailers, but only if customers use it. Possible benefits for customers, but only if retailers accept it. I think that many of the other larger existing players in this space already have most of the infrastructure in place (eg, Square) and have brand recognition to boot. So, I see a very large uphill battle for Kash in this space with their business model. However, as you point out, it isn&#x27;t necessarily a zero sum game and Kash could exist along side competitors. It will be interesting to see if they can differentiate themselves in some way and/or execute better in some way.",1408510717

Whether it&#x27;s possible for a good implementation to exist, particularly in a long-lived form that copes well with radically new technologies, is debatable.<p>My <i>moral</i> objection to patents can be concisely summed up by John Carmack:<p>&quot;The idea that I can be presented with a problem, set out to logically solve it with the tools at hand, and wind up with a program that could not be legally used because someone else followed the same logical steps some years ago and filed for a patent on it is horrifying.&quot;<p>Anything that is so specific that it could not be reproduced by an independent human in a clean room (ie, the full text of Harry Potter) is well protected by copyright.

There&#x27;s a rural/urban divide which has slowly but inevitably moved in the direction of the urban side throughout the last 100 years.

ICAN would have to alter the records in the root DNS server to point to a new IP address controlled by the family.  The family could then extort existing users of the domain for the privilege of retaining their domain name, begin collecting yearly fees from them, or open a new register for anyone that wants .ir domain name.  Yes this would be disruptive and quite possibly trigger a split in the DNS records but it is very technically possible.<p>It is also possible the family already knows all this, and don&#x27;t care.

I think it&#x27;s clear cellular phones do not cause theft. Though, I do think those robbed, are robbed of all of their valuables.

Probably not. &quot;I want your wallet, watch, and such--keep the phone.&quot;<p>I think if we were actually serious about victims, instead of using that warrant for a Kill Switch, we&#x27;d use it to query the networks and track the breadcrumbs; it&#x27;s even richer than metadata sourced from billing systems.

8201069,comment,8199665,8200429,4,0,TheMagicHorsey,,,"I tend to agree with you.<p>Patents were made to protect against an injustice, but they are causing a greater injustice.  The injustice they sought to protect against, is the cheating of the inventor of the fruits of his labor, by some Capitalist exploiter, who takes the invention without compensating the inventor.<p>Unfortunately, in order to protect against that injustice, we have created a framework that perpetuates a greater injustice. The &quot;inventors&quot; have become the wolves in this system, because the bar for invention is so low. And arguably there is no practical and economic system we could use to properly raise this bar.  The expertise required to properly remove &quot;trivial&quot; patents is too expensive for the state to deploy, and is in too short supply.  We need that expertise to be used to make things, not sit at the Patent Office to sort through patent applications.<p>Analogously, what if we were greatly troubled by bullies in American schools, and decided to deploy a system whereby highly trained monitors would follow each child around to make sure they were not bullied.  The system might result in zero bullying, but the costs might be prohibitive, not only in terms of salaries for all of these monitors, but in invasion of privacy, and perhaps even persecution of innocent children that are mistakenly identified as bullies by under-skilled monitors.<p>If we sought to remove this system of anti-bully monitors, I&#x27;m sure we would here a giant ruckus from all the anti-bullying activists who would demand that the system be kept in place ... to stop bullying. And since bullying is such a terrible thing, we would have a hard time repealing the anti-bullying law in Congress.<p>And no doubt, the union of anti-bullying monitors would raise the money to lobby against us in congress, as their jobs and benefits would be under threat.<p>Patents were the worst &quot;good&quot; idea that the founding fathers had.  They really fucked up bad.  And I don&#x27;t think we will ever be able to get out from under this shit system.  The patent lawyers make too much money.  The trolls make too much money.  The shit-stains who file the bullshit patents and don&#x27;t know how to make real products, make too much money.<p>And the American people don&#x27;t care, because, so far, the system has just acted as a tax on engineers ... and engineers make enough money to eat.  It doesn&#x27;t matter to the American people that an entry level Patent associate at a big law firm makes $160,000 per year (standard and without much variation) while a software engineer that produces the patented technology makes only about $80,000.

I know getting &quot;good idea&quot; feedback is nice and all, but when it comes down to it, I need to find users who will actually use this.<p>I have a few people lined up to help beta test so far, but I still am looking to get as much feedback as I can on this idea.<p>What are your thoughts?<p>If you were launching something like this, or any marketplace really, how would you go about it?

7033561,comment,7032153,7032153,3,0,jaboutboul,,,"Hey Lincoln,<p>Very interesting idea, good luck with the sale and your new endeavor. It&#x27;s definitely not easy supporting a commercial video chat app these days. There are a few things I&#x27;d like to point out though, for anyone following the discussion.<p>On your site you say that ooVoo doesn&#x27;t work well for group chat on mobile devices. I’d like to say otherwise. Have you ever checked out the all new ooVoo mobile video chat SDK?<p>We recently soft launched our mobile video chat SDK, so we haven&#x27;t advertised yet, but I invite everyone on HN to check it out: <a href=""http://developer.oovoo.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://developer.oovoo.com</a>. We&#x27;ve spent quite a bit of time building out a killer SDK (and all the related additions to our backend) for mobile video chat. Right now our SDK supports iOS and Android, and we have a Windows phone version coming in about a month, and yes, even blackberry too is coming soon. We’re working on adding new features like crazy and we also have a native desktop SDK and WebRTC support (with some <i>nice</i> tricks ;)) coming down the pipe which will let you do desktop <—> mobile chat. It’s so easy even a 9 year old can do it: <a href=""http://readwrite.com/2013/10/07/teen-hackers#awesm=~osusMMqTshWUNj"" rel=""nofollow"">http://readwrite.com/2013/10/07/teen-hackers#awesm=~osusMMqT...</a><p>Don’t take my word for it though, check it out. If you want to see how well it works, you can find our sample app on github: <a href=""https://github.com/oovoodev/iOS-SDK-Sample"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/oovoodev/iOS-SDK-Sample</a> (NOTE: You still need to download the SDK to compile the sample app, because it needs some of the bits from the SDK bundle.)<p>In terms of quality, we recently shipped our patented SuperClear technology which greatly improves the quality and experience of desktop <i>AND</i> mobile video. Especially in situations of network congestion/degradation. Users have been pretty happy, we&#x27;ve consistently maintained a 4/4.5 star rating on the Apple App Store. You can feel free to try it out: <a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/oovoo-video-call-text-voice/id428845974?mt=8"" rel=""nofollow"">https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/oovoo-video-call-text-voice/...</a>. We are also consistently rated as having the best overall quality of any consumer video chat product.<p>Our infrastructure is world class, our A/V cloud is distributed all over the world so that we can support over 90+ Million users doing hundreds of thousand of concurrent calls every month. Thats over a billion minutes!! It’s no easy feat but we do it because we are love providing the best quality video chat experience no matter what platform you’re on. We’re also committed to giving developers the best experience possible. We’ve spent years building out our services and infrastructure and so we are happy to open it all up to developers now. We’re also network agnostic, so no need for you or users of your app to have an account on any social network if you don’t want them too, not even an ooVoo account. It’s also a fair bit cheaper than buying an app outright, it’s just .005 cents a minute (half a cent) to build something kick ass.<p>We have more than a few hundred developers who have been playing with our SDK, everything from consulting shops, to shopping apps, to large TV networks and the feedback has been great. We’re glad to open it up and we do our best so that you can do your best and we’ll take you as far as your imagination will go. For any questions/comments you can email oovoodev@oovoo.com.",1389304558

Then I have a Node.js server that listens for those update notifications, fetches the new update once, and then pushes it out to all connected clients. This reduces a LOT of load on the server because if we have 300 clients connected, it still results in only one request to the server to fetch the new data and update all clients.<p>Even if you don&#x27;t want to use a pub/sub and publish instant notifications when data is updated you could implement polling in a Node.js server and just have all the clients connect to it with Socket.io. Then when the Node.js server sees an update in the data it can push it out to all the clients.<p>This strategy also has the advantage that you don&#x27;t have to change anything on the client if you decide to switch to a pub/sub in the future for more real time updates.",1389304438

Framework knowledge doesn&#x27;t really matter.<p>* I might be &quot;hubris&quot; to write your own framework for a small throwaway client project, but when you are heavily invested in your own product, every option is on the table.

It hasn&#x27;t completely subsidized the cost of living, spent its oil wealth on giant, shiny objects, hoarded the wealth amongst a corrupt and tiny class of elites, or built an enormous social-services machine that won&#x27;t survive an oil bust or pricing collapse. It&#x27;s not spending above its means, presumably under the realization that its means came from a geological lottery ticket.<p>When your country hits the oil jackpot, your job is to convert the oil money to real industry.

I think that’s something you see all through the Valley. The information technology industry feeds off it because information technologies can so easily be aimed at satisfying individual needs. You see that rhetoric leveraged when Google and other firms say, &#x27;Don’t regulate us. We need to be creative. We need to be free to pursue our satisfaction because that’s ultimately what will provide a satisfying society.&#x27;<p>That’s all a way of ignoring the systems that make the world possible. One example from the ‘60s that I think is pretty telling is all the road trips. The road trips are always about the heroic actions of people like Ken Kesey and Neal Cassady and their amazing automobiles, right? Never, never did it get told that those road trips were only made possible by Eisenhower’s completion of the highway system. The highway system is never in the story. It’s boring. What’s in the story is the heroic actions of bootstrapped individuals pursuing conscious change. What we see out here now is, again, those heroic stories. And there are real heroes. But the real heroes are operating with automobiles and roads and whole systems of support without which they couldn’t be heroic.&quot;<p>I find the individualist rhetoric in Silicon Valley to be puzzling. There is a huge emphasis on the wonderkid with the genius idea, not the team of dozens or hundreds that took a half-assed idea and turned it into a product. To steal some terminology from &#x27;pg (without imputing to him any political leaning): Silicon Valley culture right now glorifies the hacker/painter designing organisms in Lisp over the pyramid builder building pyramids in Pascal. This is an elevation of the individual, the creative genius, over the institution, the organized team. But the internet is the product of an era when America was all about institutions, not individuals. The military-industrial complex built the internet. The federal government built the highways. NASA put a man on the moon. That era was all about the power of pyramid builders working in structured, hierarchical organizations.<p>So I find the &quot;road trip&quot; analogy particularly apropos. You have these guys going on heroic, individualist road trips, but they&#x27;re riding on this infrastructure created by big institutions, infrastructure that only big institutions have the scale to create.<p>EDIT: My comment was really more about individualism versus institutions than libertarians, and has been edited accordingly.",1389301699

I&#x27;d also tend to believe if he wasn&#x27;t working at all that night, if he was &quot;off,&quot; Uber would have probably pointed that out in their statement. &quot;The guy hadn&#x27;t even been working for us at all that day!!!&quot;<p>So it really makes no difference if he had a fare in his car. If he was working that night, he was working, he was just in between fares. And the whole independent contractor thing means nothing. If I were the family&#x27;s lawyer I&#x27;d have no problem arguing that driving a cab in the city is an &quot;inherently dangerous activity.&quot; [1]<p>But hey, I expect nothing less than Uber&#x27;s &quot;not our problem&quot; response given their Objectivist CEO.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.williamskastner.com/employers-may-face-vicarious-liability-for-dangerous-acts-of-independent-contractors/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.williamskastner.com/employers-may-face-vicarious-...</a>",1389301288

I don&#x27;t have a cloud project, I just do my own data analysis/learning with IPython and IHaskell, and think a multi-pane approach would be much more powerful. (I applied for an account with Sense, looking forward to playing with it and providing feedback).",1389301287

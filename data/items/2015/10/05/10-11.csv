In fact, it sounded like the sort of place I would love to work, but at the same time I knew that the majority of my coworkers would not fit in. The basic tenet as I understood it is that you can replace the structure of management with a structure of decision-making processes where decisions are taken at the lowest possible rung (where lowest means as close as possible to the work the decision impacts).

All legally available cars are thoroughly regulated and tested - that&#x27;s why they don&#x27;t explode on the road or poison people to death as they drive by. Every product out there is regulated against direct health hazards, and that&#x27;s the only reason you can safely shop.<p>Also, the government did the testing for emissions, it&#x27;s VW that cheated on them. You could question the quality of those tests but then again, if you know you&#x27;ll have to test fraudsters, why don&#x27;t just go ahead and arrest them instead of investing tons of resources in more fraud-proof tests? The government probably saved a lot of money trusting the companies to act in good faith. VW has just abused this trust, and it&#x27;s entirely their fault.<p>> <i>Fine, but those are failings of the state, not of the free-market or competition.</i><p>If those are failings of state not being strict enough, then let&#x27;s state the corollary - that free market / competition are not saviours, but savage beasts that need to be controlled in order to put their power to good use.<p>> <i>Ironically, discussions like these are what eventually drove me to consider non-state solutions to the problems around us. I looked around and was presented with really countless scenarios/problems that are &quot;bad&quot; or &quot;unwanted&quot;, and the state not fixing it despite claims by them that it is a problem. E.g. car accidents/fatalities, 100+ years later, and still happening even in civilized countries.</i><p>I also had a similar turn towards non-state solutions, mostly because it&#x27;s becoming evident that you couldn&#x27;t design a system less capable of dealing with actual, serious issues than modern democracy. I looked briefly at private businesses for solutions and while they seem to be a <i>much</i> more efficient instrument than politics, the private sector is filled with even more corrupt people than there are in public.

I bought a 1.6dCi Nissan Qashqai in 2013 and that engine has only one advantage - ridiculously low fuel consumption. Seriously, my usage is usually around 5L/100km or less(56 UK MPG/47 US MPG). But - the engine is very noisy and rumbly, plus it takes forever to warm up in winter. Seriously, I drive on the motorway on my way to work and it&#x27;s still a solid 10 minutes before any warm air starts to enter the cabin. For the temperature indicator to get to the middle, operational position, it&#x27;s 20 minutes of driving. It&#x27;s unacceptable.

Traditionally, for many jurisdictions, circumventing DRM is typically reserved for civil penalties. Criminal penalties implies that the government would foot the bill for enforcement. In civil cases, it is typically rights holders that go after individuals.<p>... civil damages do apply. How much are civil damages if an alleged infringer is found guilty? Well, that is up to rights holders, not a judge. Prosecution is able to determine the damages and a judge would have to accept whatever number comes out regardless of evidence to the contrary. A good example might be that a song may be sold for 99 cents, but the damages sought could be in the millions for all the prosecutors are concerned.<p>... an act of copyright infringement as set forth in this “trade” agreement doesn’t actually have to occur before the authorities are sent after you. There just has to be evidence that infringement is taking place or is about to take place.<p>... if you have a cell phone, and you have something on it that could be considered infringing, authorities have the right to seize it because you are suspected of trafficking. Of course, you could also be liable for civil and criminal penalties as earlier outlined and could be fined any amount copyright holders feel like.<p>... you could be fined on the spot because of your cell phone on top of it all. No need for a judge here. Also, no, you may not get your cell phone back. It could be destroyed ... Who gets to pay for all of this? According to page 77, you do.&quot;</i>",1444041318

In Germany, we have more jobs now, because we followed this route, but less people can live from their earnings -- and the social system has been undermined to reach the optimal state for &quot;more jobs&quot; (and more profits for the corporations). So, the result plainly is: More really poor people, that either work their ass of (some with two or three jobs) or are living in extreme poverty, strangled by a ruthless social security system. And of course: The rich people get even more money. For the shrinking &quot;middle class&quot; nothing is left.",1444039716

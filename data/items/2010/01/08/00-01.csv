Someone is bound to build a Ruby VM in JS at some point and then it'll be trivial to build a site like this.<p>The performance will be horrible, of course, but once that happens some other person will come along and run a subset of Rails (or some other Ruby web framework) with an evented db backend on it (for async callbacks to the server over HTTP) to run an app in the browser.<p>Which would be pretty cool, though not useful.

""'With seven million systems in the DoD, think how many idiots there are bound to be,' one Pentagon cybersecurity official says.""<p>Some security experts believe they can create the perfect firewall around an enterprise or government.  It's not foolproof -- the firewall will either become vulnerable at some time or insiders will compromise security measures through idiocy or subterfuge.<p>After implementing preliminary security measures, e.g., firewalls, the best step any infrastructure maintainer should next do is to record and archive the massive flow of data through the network, computers, server programs, and applications in any enterprise.  While one can't realistically capture all network traffic or every disk write/read, one can capture the ""fingerprints"" of many of these activities, at hardware-, server/application-, and at end-user levels, including for physical security devices.  Once this information is stored and made queryable, an enterprise can pick apart and analyze their information flows and find vulnerabilities, learn to patch them, and find evidence of past misdeeds similar to newly discovered threats.  Only with years of queryable archives of 200GB+ daily of log data can enterprises really take this step.<p>SenSage (<a href=""http://www.sensage.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sensage.com</a>) realized this and in the early naughties developed the SenSage log data warehouse.

I can't remember the actual stats and I'm too bloody lazy to go look it up, but it was on the order of a couple of million.  You can house a criminal for quite a long time before that money's spent.<p>Further, the current version of incarceration has been shown to not help rehabilitate, yes.  I totally give you that.  But the current version of incarceration was never designed to rehabilitate.  It was designed to securely lock people away for a long time, and that's about it.  In pursuit of that goal, we've turned our prisons into a very scary place that (IMHO) does more harm than good.<p>This isn't to say that every version of incarceration has to be evil in that same way.  What if prisons were run with the specific incentive to rehabilitate people at all costs?  This really hasn't been tried except in some very limited circumstances, though largely because it's political suicide.

The typical case performance on my site is fantastic.  The worst case performance is an abomination -- when it flushes the site essentially pauses for all users for five seconds.<p>This is tolerable for me, but only just.  The reason I use memcachedb as opposed to vanilla memcached is because I was worried about persistence in the event of a server failure, but given that I can count resets of my server over 3.5 years on a single hand, I might just decide ""In the event of a server failure, I lose any A/B tests in progress and have to start over.

The facts are that the credit card companies don't need to do an appraisal - the entire market where this person lives is down 50% from the time they took out the mortgage. The person maintains a good income and can easily pay the mortgage payment, it just doesn't make sense any more for them to throw good money after bad to hold on to a FICO score that really doesn't get them credit any more.",1262909975

The power / performance ratio compared to the Atoms is just so good, it's almost ridiculous.<p>A few years ago we had the iPhone, then the 3GS came with the Cortex A8 processor and the speed improvement is enormous. The Cortex A9 has an even better performance / Hertz ratio. Anand expects a similar (iPhone -> 3GS) speedup is possible with the Cortex A9.<p>The Tegra has 2 cores, but even more cores are possible. According to Anand, the chips can also scale to beyond 2GHz on a 28nm design. There are many chip producers creating chips on the Cortex A9 design, there is enough choice and difference between chips to create decent competition. With the way the ARM designs are licensed, silicon bakers can add whatever functionality they want, targetting smartphones, tablets, netbooks, whatever.<p>Most companies have chip samples and development boards ready by now.

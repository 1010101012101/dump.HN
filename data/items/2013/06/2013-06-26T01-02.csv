I don&#x27;t see how it would be hypocritical.<p>If you loved giving, you&#x27;d give everything you owned. To stand up and say &quot;I love to give&quot; when you have no intention of giving 100% to charity is hypocritical. You don&#x27;t love to give, you&#x27;re just buying attention.<p>> 2. It should steal credit form the recipient. The money is what makes charities work, more than the work in itself.<p>Depending on the charity, it&#x27;s the people who donate their time that are the valuable ones. In any case, giving half a percent of your annual income is hardly backbreaking labor. To the obscenely wealthy, its often just a tax write-off. It&#x27;s valuable to the charity but less of a sacrifice than others are making. You&#x27;re getting re-rewarded for your wealth, while others who are poorer are giving more (as a percentage) and receiving less. Hardly a charitable distribution of gratitude.<p>> 3. What&#x27;s so great about selfless giving? If donations can increase by publishing the donor&#x27;s name, so be it! Is there even a single downside to selfish giving? Money is money, no matter the intent.<p>Jobs was a Buddhist and selfless giving without receiving anything in return is considered a valuable trait to Buddhists (true humility).

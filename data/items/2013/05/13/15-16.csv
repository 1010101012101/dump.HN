5699423,comment,5697999,5698927,1,0,bornhuetter,,,"Satisfaction amongst users of the product is a very poor proxy for popularity amongst the general population.  One reason for this is that if someone is unhappy with iOS, there is a good chance that they will switch to Android or another platform, and hence remove themselves from the iOS pool.  Another big reason is that making a device that appeals very much to a niche segment will give you a much better score than a product aimed at a broader user base - so the ""popular"" product will almost always end up with a lower satisfaction score.",1368460750

The `<<` operator is being abused to mean ""bind"", so the right side is a normal expression (constructing a Foo and Bar) and the left side matches it to a particular ""shape"".<p>The purposes of pattern matching is to replace code that looks like this:<p><pre><code>    if  (isinstance(tree, BinOp)\n            and type(tree.left) is Name\n            and type(tree.op) is Mod\n            and tree.left.id in module.expr_registry):\n        ...</code></pre>\nwith code that looks like this<p><pre><code>    if BinOp(Name(id), Mod(), body) << tree \n            and id in module.expr_registry:\n        ...\n</code></pre>\nWhich looks much nicer, and more clearly says what you want: that `tree` ""looks like"" a particular shape.<p>EDIT: Here's another example. Turning this:<p><pre><code>    if  ((isinstance(tree, ClassDef) or isinstance(tree, FunctionDef))\n            and len(tree.decorator_list) == 1\n            and tree.decorator_list[0]\n            and type(tree.decorator_list[0]) is Name\n            and tree.decorator_list[0].id in module.decorator_registry):\n        ...\n</code></pre>\ninto:<p><pre><code>    if  ((isinstance(tree, ClassDef) or isinstance(tree, FunctionDef))\n            and [Name(id)] << tree.decorator_list \n            and id in module.decorator_registry):\n        ...\n</code></pre>\nDoesn't quite work yet, but we're getting there",1368460750

This equated to over 150,000 tweets and was drawn from the DOLLY project based at the University of Kentucky. Because algorithmic sentiment analysis would automatically classify any tweet containing 'hate words' as ""negative,"" this project relied upon the HSU students to read the entirety of tweet and classify it as positive, neutral or negative based on a predefined rubric. Only those tweets that were identified by human readers as negative were used in this analysis.<p>To produce the map all tweets containing each 'hate word' were aggregated to the county level and normalized by the total twitter traffic in each county. Counties were reduced to their centroids and assigned a weight derived from this normalization process. This was used to generate a heat map that demonstrates the variability in the frequency of hateful tweets relative to all tweets over space. Where there is a larger proportion of negative tweets referencing a particular 'hate word' the region appears red on the map, where the proportion is moderate, the word was used less (although still more than the national average) and appears a pale blue on the map. Areas without shading indicate places that have a lower proportion of negative tweets relative to the national average.<p>The numbers that appear in the map during a mouse hover indicate the total number of hateful tweets and number of unique users sending them in each county.<p>==========================================<p>EDIT: The mouse overs don't appear to work very well in Chrome or Firefox, but from the one or two times I was able to see some numbers it appears that each red circle may be a dozen or less tweets. Also, the hot zones dissipate significantly the further you zoom in, so without any statistics or numbers it's difficult to draw conclusions.<p>A very interesting experiment, but given that the data is only normalized by Twitter traffic (non-response bias) this is in no way indicative of the actual distribution of racism.",1368459131

This also allows complex composition. Say you want to run 4 functions A, B, C and D, such that A and B are called together, C is called when A returns, then D is called when B and C both return. This is clumsy to do on Q, requiring packing promises into an array, etc.<p>The other big thing is error handling. In Q, if you forget to set an error handler at the end of the chain or explicitly set the default handler with .done(), errors go unhandled. This is clumsy; in fact the Q documentation says:<p>""This is a stopgap. We are exploring ways to make unhandled errors visible without any explicit handling.""<p>We've implemented this in andthen. If there's no error handler and execution reached the end of the chain, it will be thrown so Node or the browser will print it.<p>There's fulfilment as well, but I get your point about putting this better in the README.",1368458885

I try, or often only buy DRM-free games on Steam to support them.<p>Apple's iTunes switched in the past few years to distributing music without DRM that encumbered their files and locked in consumers to their iEcosystem. Those files can be uploaded, trivially, to any file sharing network.<p>The Gordian knot of the problem of piracy and DRM is that only one dedicated person needs to leak it, and as long as I can listen to, look at or sense content, the analog hole will exist. Content industries have tried the approach of treating all of their customers like criminals, and it's been awful for consumers and the amount of content available trivially on peer to peer networks hasn't decreased or even decelerated, as far as I can tell.

It probably means that 'low level staffers' with an axe to grind have been wielding this power in unfair ways across the board. This just highlights a case where politics was an issue.

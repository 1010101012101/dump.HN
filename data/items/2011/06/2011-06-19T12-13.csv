2670777,comment,2670674,2670674,1,0,olliesaunders,,,"The not guilty verdict of Kenneth, the sleepwalk killer, bothers me. It doesn’t seem likely to me that they jury was in any doubt whether he committed the crime. And, in that case, our legal system says you should find the defendant guilty. I guess the jury gave the not guilty verdict because they felt it would be wrong for the defendant to be punished for a crime he committed while sleepwalking. This suggests to me that there’s insufficient separation in our legal system between whether someone committed a crime and what should be done about it. The assumption, you committed a crime therefore you should be punished, is deeply flawed and deserves serious reconsideration.",1308488320

The opposite would work, but it's not legal. The @for attribute says they are related.<p>> I do not understand what you mean by ""simpler scripting"". Are you trying to make a special script action when they click the words?<p>Not necessarily click, but hover for instance. What if hovering over a label gave meta-information on the related field?

2670745,comment,2668906,2668906,1,0,reirob,,,"Hello dear hacker fellow,<p>I fully understand how you feel - I've got to the same state you are, with a difference that it came 10 years later than for you. I've got the same feelings about being unsatisfied, not challenged enough, feeling not useful, feeling not understood. With a difference - though it might not be a real advantage - I did not feel inferior and I do not envy others who achieve more than me. This is because in my youth I had a friend who helped me to gain much confidence.<p>Still, I got stuck - secure situation, paid job, family, kids, paying the house every month - but not happy. It came to a moment when I went to my doctor and told him that I cannot continue any more. He stopped me from working, 4 months. I still see my doctor twice a week. It's difficult, but it helped me to take decisions - I quit the job and are about to build my own thing. I have still a lot to understand on myself and other personal decisions to take. But bit by bit I get the confidence back, I start contacting friends, start to talk, start to act.<p>I think you need somebody to speak to. You need real friend(s) with whom you can freely discuss about your feelings, your fears, uncertainties. It might be that a good psychoanalyst might help - this is the case for me, though it took me to try out 2 different before I found the one I am comfortable with. And this despite the fact that I am still critical about psychoanalysis, that I do not fully trust it, that I find psychoanalysts most of the time talking BS, that I find psychoanalysts elitists, despite the fact that they will never take the risk and give you any ETA ;) - for me it helped to resolve some problems.<p>Two years before my break down, a friend told me that I should start psychoanalysis. And I told him all the arguments, why I was not sure I wanted to - it is expensive, how am I going to provide for my family, it will take too much time, I do not trust psychoanalysis, etc... He told me: ""Anyway, one day you will have no choice and all the fears you have today will become insignificant and it will be about your survival."" Two years after the moment came. But I wish, I was strong enough to take his advice earlier and avoid the breakdown...<p>But this is only my personal opinion and you will get many different and contradictory opinions and advices. It will be up to you to sort out which match for you.<p>I wish you good luck",1308486434
2670744,comment,2668915,2669388,1,0,zmmmmm,,,"> It's actually somewhat ironic, since chrome wasn't ever specifically intended to take over the browser market<p>I remember that was the early line about Chrome, and I believed it then.  I no longer believe it; Google is spending waaay too much money advertising Chrome for it to be true.  I recently came back from Europe to Melbourne, Australia to discover the central train station with every available advertising space plastered with giant ads for Chrome.  And I'm being quite literal about that - Google clearly went and bought out every spot in an entire section of the station.<p>I don't quite understand Google's full motives for Chrome but I now believe it matters <i>very</i> much to them that it gains substantial market share.   Chrome <i>is</i> technically excellent and my browser of choice on any platform it is available on.   But that is only half the reason it is succeeding.",1308486432

2670741,comment,2670224,2670625,4,0,thaumaturgy,,,"Yeah, I don't think he's being entirely honest.<p>There's this part:<p>> <i>Out of the 170 or so attendees, I would guess there were about 15 to 20 blacks and maybe 10 of other ethnicities. The majority of participants were white and mostly guys.</i><p>If the focus is on their age, why doesn't he mention the age distribution there?<p>The only time in the entire post that he conflates their age with being a minority is, ""...in terms of age and race"".<p>Also, the accelerator program he's running doesn't exactly appear to be geared towards kids -- although, to be fair, it's hard to tell for sure, since the founders' ages aren't included in the bios of the companies they're working with. So, when he says, ""Numbers like this is just another reason why we’re launching the NewME Accelerator to help other minorities launch their startup,"" I don't think he means age there, either.<p>This really bugs me. <i>If</i> the focus is on ethnicity and gender, I think that could become an extremely pernicious idea in this industry, because any bets on the future successes of an idea should rest solely on the quality of the idea, and any bets on the future successes of founders should rest solely on the founders' personalities and their determination to make their business successful. Ethnicity and gender should not be playing any role in any of that; to give extra attention to a startup because of the gender or ethnicity of the founders is to do a disservice not only to them -- because they will still need to compete in a market which is far less interested in their ethnicity or gender -- but also to other startups competing for resources.<p>Oh, and then there was this part:<p>> <i>Marci and Ben experienced what it’s like to be a minority in tech. You can have great ideas, and people can and will say it’s a good idea but at the end of the day you may be own your own with little support.</i><p>No, they experienced what it's like to be <i>people</i> in tech.",1308486338

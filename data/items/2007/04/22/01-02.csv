If they are there for her to take, why hide them in her purse?<p>I am not faulting her at all for 'taking' the granola bars. I am certain, I might have done the same as her - but I am unrich and I would have taken them openly, in full view and so I might be justified - I think.<p>My comment was solely a wonderment, an observation, that a wealthy millionaire needed to do that.<p>I must be the worst communicator - judging from my product (juwo).<p>\nSeriously, can you look beyond what was an unpopular comment? I was trying to understand why an intellectual and financial millionaire from the cream of society did that.<p>Do millionaires behave differently, or do they stay the same? Or worse?",1177206937

Explaining -how- you're going to make it easy to use might be useful as well.<p>Describe a real hypothetical user (three if possible) using the software.  Describe in as much detail as possible, and then explain at some level how your technology will allow you to accomplish this.",1177206331

It's a list of common keywords arranged in a magic cloud with visual intensity feedback.  It's good for a quick overview of what the site is about.<p>But I think the title and tagline of a blog is a better indication.  A tag cloud is just a visual cacophony of symbols my mind tries to parse unsuccessfully.  If I'm on a blog I haven't been to before it's generally because I came from here or google.  In that case, I'm there for a specific keyword or reason already.<p>The big thing that really bugs me about tag clouds is when I click on one and it leads me to another.  That's just not helpful.",1177205474

If the knowledge domain is 'foo' you can quickly work out how the vocab is skewed to a particular subject. This is useful, unless they are spammed.",1177204929
15580,comment,15554,15559,0,0,jward,,,"I really like the fact that comments count for something here.  In fact I'd be happy if posts counted for nothing and only comments did.  It promotes and rewards discussion, which is what I come here for.  Articles are good and all, but the real value of this site is in its users.<p>I like to believe that the majority of people are like myself and vote up or down on things for the same reasons.  Disagreeing with opinions never enters into my mind as a reason to vote down.  I vote comments down when they are highly off topic, rude, or personal attacks.  I use this in hopes that it sets the tone for YC News.  That is, as a place for mature discussion and education about startups, not one where kittens with pancakes on their heads or flamers with four letter vocabularies are welcome.<p>To be blunt and honest, it is the content of your comments that is causing them to be voted down.  The comment in specific that you linked to came across as a personal attack and quite rude.  I'm sure this was not your intent, but that's how it came across.  This comment you posted referring to members of the community as monkeys also comes across as rude.  You may have valid points and questions, but you need to find better ways of saying them.  When you attack the people rather than the idea, it doesn't reflect well.",1177204925

Today when I was jogging I realized your chosen project name sounds like an antisemitic breakfast beverage: Jew-O, for Nazi astronauts.  Cf. The Toyota Incubus (there's a story floating around about a product named Incubus which had to be recalled at the last minute.  The culprit is alternately either Toyota, Nike, or Reebok).\n",1177203785

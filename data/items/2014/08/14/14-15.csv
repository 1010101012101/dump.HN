Assuming the terms of the acquisition were favourable, you should have a fair amount of financial freedom (at least for a few months). Take some time to travel and see parts of the world that are new to you. For me, travel is a very effective &quot;reset&quot; that helps me examine my life and the world more holistically.<p>After founding a startup and working hard to see it succeed, you&#x27;re probably used to a fast-paced cadence and it&#x27;s hard to relax into a less high-producing role. Time box your relaxing so you don&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re just giving up - but give yourself some space to live.",1408028385

When I buy an apple or some meat in the grocery store they are simply opaque to me. Their production is completely invisible. Was it a farmer in my home country who produced it, driving around in his comfortable tractor, or was it a hard pressed third world farmer whose children go uneducated despite his best efforts? Knowing this through some technological means, even to an imperfect degree, would probably affect my choices.",1408028365

It has both built in zooming and text-to-speech (VoiceOver). Many apps, including Audible.com, are very accessible and work well with VoiceOver. If you have an iOS device on hand, check out the Settings->General->Accessibility offering or look at this: <a href=""https://www.apple.com/accessibility/ios/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.apple.com/accessibility/ios/</a>. You should also take a look at applevis.com.<p>You should also check with his local government to see what services are available for the blind and visually impaired.

8177792,comment,8177259,8177259,2,0,IanDrake,,,"Can you say what exactly is not under your control?  I hear that frequently, but most times people misinterpret their feeling out of control with not having the ability to control things in their life.<p>At 25 I was married, had a house, a riding mower, 3 cars, and everything felt out of control.  I had pretty much the same crisis.  At that point I was making good money, but my stuff owned me.  So, I sold the stuff and started to take control.<p>One year later, I was debt free and had tons of options.  I could have put my few possessions in storage and lived in Costa Rica or backpacked across Europe.  I didn&#x27;t do that, but I could have, and that made a huge difference in my mental state.",1408028341

I think, &quot;maybe I am using imposter syndrome as a way to sneakily support my ego that is only partially supported by reality. Reality does not support my ego at the inflated levels I want to believe in.&quot; But then I think - well, I suppose I have to be smart to trick myself in such a ridiculous way, and conclude I actually am smart. That leads me to think that I am actually an intellectual imposter, and it&#x27;s traditional that I take that as a truth, which my ego has temporarily decided to not believe in, for certain problem kinds.<p>Lately, I build on top of externally developing habits - like studying, running, meditating, eating healthy, sleeping healthy, working at a normal pace, and having confidence in my own opinions about computer science, logic, mathematics, and programming. This helps me think less about how I perceive myself and how others perceive me, but I can get knocked off my horse once in a while. I just try to remind myself that it&#x27;s just time wasted that I could use studying, working, or helping other people - which is more thinking about the long long term, rather than each individual achievement.",1408028285

In my country banking is dominated by Java and I&#x27;ve seen mixtures too and migrations from C# to Java.<p>.NET has several problems. Microsoft targeted Windows while Java&#x27;s rise is correlated with the rise of Linux on the server-side. Linux on the server-side is cheap and reliable and people want more and more Linux and Microsoft&#x27;s cooperation with Xamarin is kind of too late and is meant for mobile phones and not Linux, but who knows. Microsoft also failed to create an open-source community around .NET, while Java&#x27;s open-source ecosystem is huge and even the commercial tools available are cheaper. Microsoft advertised .NET as being multi-language but dropped the ball later and failed to attract new languages, whereas other languages are flourishing on top of the JVM, keeping Java the platform hip. Microsoft also failed to convince startups to use .NET and today&#x27;s startups are tomorrow&#x27;s corporations.",1408028280

(I strongly believe that data has no value until it is used for analysis and decision making.)<p>Data coming from the vehicle sensors and other sources are concurrently being used for analysis (by both hundreds of engineers and a wide range of &quot;algorithms&quot;) as well as input to simulation models. The results from the simulations means that even more data is being generated even when the vehicle isn&#x27;t running.<p>Within minutes, using the data, the different engineering groups (typically responsible for a sub-system, ie. engine, tires, aerodynamics) arrive at conclusions which then the vehicle&#x27;s race/performance engineers are using to enhance the setup of the vehicle. The results of changes are then fed back to the engineers, and evaluating if the analysis and predictions are correct is a big part of the post-event work.<p>I honestly can&#x27;t think of any other industry that carries out this kind of analysis of highly non-linear systems at this scale and speed.

The <i>only</i> consideration taken by this scheduling software were worker preferences: management doesn&#x27;t care who covers the shifts, just that they&#x27;re covered.   So it took into account &quot;fairness&quot;, day of week preferences, scheduled holidays, et cetera.<p>By those measures, the software does a lot better than humans.   However, there&#x27;s something to be said about the predictability of the old human schedules.   The humans generally just figured out a 2 week schedule and repeated it; filling in holes created by scheduling conflicts with those workers they knew were usually eager to pick up more work.<p>IOW, you may previously have worked every 2nd Tuesday.   If you couldn&#x27;t work on a particular Tuesday, you just didn&#x27;t work.   Now you&#x27;re much more likely to get a solid 2 shifts a month (presuming that&#x27;s what you asked for),  most will be on days you marked as preferred, some days may be on some you marked as available and none on days you marked as not available.<p>Now obviously I could have added a metric to guide the system towards more &#x27;regular&#x27; schedules.  But it would still compensate for those other considerations, and would still look somewhat random.   It&#x27;s usually pretty easy to tell the difference between a computer-generated and a human-generated schedule, and many people still prefer the human generated ones, even if it is less &#x27;fair&#x27; by almost any measure.<p>Given how crazy a schedule generated solely by worker preferences is, I shudder to consider schedules driven solely by management preference...",1408027510

It seems reasonable to increase their utilization instead of setting aside a dedicated pool for taxi services.<p>Regulatory upgrade. The existing regulations and licensing regimes were meant to increase safety and quality of service, but did that at the cost of reduced competition, increased prices and granting disproportionate privileges to the incumbents. Some of the same very goals like trust, safety and quality have now been achieved by Uber and the like without the same costs thanks to the reputation and review systems long employed in the internet.

TA is a bit cluttered and sometimes hard to find exactly what you are looking for.

This way, if I am going to Paris for example, and I see a trip that is tagged &quot;Music&quot;, and I&#x27;m not into a music trip, then I know I should look at someone else&#x27;s trip for Paris.

8177667,comment,8177262,8177564,12,0,_delirium,,,"Yeah, there was recently a (rare) train strike in Sweden over something vaguely along these lines. The train company wanted to move to flex-staffing that can vary on a week-by-week or day-by-day basis based on traffic models. The proximate trigger was that they laid off 250 salaried employees and immediately re-hired them as hourly employees, but the real issue of the strike was over that kind of flex-staffing. The strike ended with a compromise proposed by a mediator that was a victory for the train companies on the main formal dispute (no limit on hourly or flex staffing), but seen as a practical win for the union (hourly workers will have to be paid a significant wage premium over the salaried equivalent, to compensate for the uncertainty/precarity of the arrangement): <a href=""http://www.thelocal.se/20140618/swedens-trains-back-on-track-as-strike-ends"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thelocal.se/20140618/swedens-trains-back-on-track...</a>",1408026831

The question is now theirs to deal with, in due time. By auto-deleting it, it reverts to being my problem. I&#x27;m sending that email for the purpose of getting work done. In that sense, auto-deleting it is preventing me from doing my work. And then I just have to send it again once they&#x27;re back.<p>Here&#x27;s the deal, and this is the point I think the (maybe unnecessarily heavy-handed) policy is meant to drive: You&#x27;re not free to task your colleagues with work while they&#x27;re away on holiday just be cause you can. If you rely on someone who&#x27;s not there to get your job done then you can&#x27;t do you job. That may or may be be your fault, but the organisation needs to be able to keep functioning while members are on holiday.<p>Sure, there exists cases where you only need a reply eventually, and only from that one exact individual, but in most cases, someone is actually covering and can handle the request as part of the normal workload, and in most of those cases, everybody is better off if you actually re-route the request to that person immediately.<p>And here&#x27;s the bit I think is slightly heavy handed: Coming back from holidays, I like spending an afternoon skimming over emails for situational awareness. Deleting email would deprive me of the option to passively catch up rather than depending on having everything explained to me by colleagues. Skimming a few thousand emails is easy, making sure you&#x27;ve caught everything single thing you might be expected to respond to is stressful.",1408026495

If F1 races added up to 100 gigabytes per second to that, it would be a 100% increase at night or a 30% increase when the sun is up here.<p>The article mentions it also needs to span continents. I&#x27;m pretty sure that if you want to reliably transfer 100GB/s, you&#x27;d need to roll new cables between a couple of continents.

Also, the next job can be your financial foundation as you start your next gig on the side. Running a startup should not put your family&#x27;s livelihood at risk. My father is an entrepreneur and frequently had several small side projects going on at any given time while I was growing up. Right now, he&#x27;s focused on building up one business, but another business he built up previously is still bringing in solid income. Several great companies started as side projects while the founders were occupied with some other &quot;real&quot; job: GitHub, Google (perhaps debatable, but it started while the founders were full-time students), Facebook, Basecamp, and the list goes on and on. I once read James Altucher explain that he stayed at his &quot;real&quot; job for two years while he built up his side business. By the time he quit to work on his startup full-time, the startup was already extremely healthy with several full-time employees and enough customers to profitably pay everyone a great salary. Of course, you&#x27;ll have to talk to your new employer to work out the legality of creating side projects.

I hated having bosses. I don&#x27;t know if my ideas were the best, but I feel like I tend to have good gut instincts. I was tired of not having control of what I was doing.<p>I worked at a small web shop, a big ad agency, and a tiny remote-only web thing. I saw what people were doing, and what was out there, and knew that I knew enough that I could survive.<p>The hardest part was making the leap. To say &quot;OK, I design and develop websites under my own flag,&quot; and then to find people. Having worked in the industry for a while, I had contacts, and so far (knock on wood) I haven&#x27;t really had to do a lot of marketing. It&#x27;s all mostly word-of-mouth. Build something, do a great job, get remembered/recommended, repeat.<p>Even though when you first get started you&#x27;ll take a couple projects you might not be thrilled with to get your feet underneath you, soon enough you&#x27;ll be raising your rates, getting to say no to projects your not interested, and maybe even working on small product-like projects too to mix in with your client-work. That&#x27;s what I&#x27;m doing, I also co-lead development of a little CMS called Statamic. I use it on a lot of my clients&#x27; sites (if they&#x27;re OK with it), and using it lets me improve it, while improving it helps me sell it.<p>It&#x27;s not glamorous. It will probably never net me a 7-figure-profit for a year. But it&#x27;s fun, challenging, and rewarding. You don&#x27;t have to build a product that makes hundreds or thousands of people happy. You can build one site for one person and they&#x27;ll be just as thrilled. And on top of that, all the challenges of business are there too. You get to pay taxes and everything. :)<p>You also mentioned family obligations. For me, being self-employed helps with that too. If something comes up, I can walk away from my desk and go help out — whether it&#x27;s picking up the kids, or just meeting my wife for lunch if she&#x27;s having a bad day.<p>Self-employment is risk, but it&#x27;s a calculated risk that balances with freedom. If I want to make more, I take on more projects. The hardest part I&#x27;ve found is turning that off. (&quot;You mean working 80 hours pays me 80 hours!? SIGN ME UP!&quot; — that just leads to burn out.)<p>Anyway, I know Hacker News is more startup-focused, and that you&#x27;re probably more interested in that, but I wanted to throw my two cents in that there are other things you can do relating to the Internet that are just as interesting and just as rewarding.",1408025679

Anyhow, to answer your actual question:<p>>  I wonder who benefits from this kind of library. You can react to user input with a simple keyup event.<p>Well, obviously.  The use case for two-way data binding is <i>every single place you would ever use a simple keyup event</i>.  The two approaches do the same thing in very similar ways; and a two-way data binding library is generally nothing more than some simple boilerplate over the plain event binding.  For example, with Knockout you could put this in your HTML:<p><pre><code>    <input data-bind=&quot;event: { keypress: handler}&quot; />\n</code></pre>\nOr if you like jQuery you could put this:<p><pre><code>    <input id=&quot;field1&quot; />\n</code></pre>\nAnd then in your JS you could put this:<p><pre><code>    $(&#x27;#field1&#x27;).keypress(handler);\n</code></pre>\nAs far as reacting to user input, they do the exact same thing in the exact same way.  The difference is that Knockout example has very slightly less typing, that it&#x27;s (to my eyes) very slightly clearer what&#x27;s going on when you look at the HTML.<p>There&#x27;s a lot of ways to structure an app.  Two-way data binding helps with one of the obvious ways; it&#x27;s simple and (if you&#x27;re sane about it), clear.  Which is probably why it&#x27;s a core part of Angular, Knockout, Ember, Mithril, Vue, Ractive, and a bunch more frameworks besides, and provided by popular plugins for Backbone and React.<p>TL;DR:  People who want some boilerplate to hide a bunch of ugly event binding.<p>Edit:  To be clear, two-way data binding is one of many ways of organising an app, and by no means the best way.  But if your question is &quot;why not just use some random event bindings&quot;, I&#x27;m not sure you understand the problem space.",1408025135

This only happened when a command was run that had a large amount of streaming output. Turned out our provider&#x27;s frame relay network had become misconfigured.

Turns out you can disable ARP replies on Solaris by deleting the &quot;publish&quot; entry for the box&#x27;s own MAC addr from its ARP table. And someone or something had done that by accident. So the box was only reachable on the LAN till its MAC timed out of the other hosts&#x27; ARP caches.

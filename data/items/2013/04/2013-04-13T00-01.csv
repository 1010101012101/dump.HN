5542027,comment,5537770,5537770,1,0,lutusp,,,"If the consequences weren't so tragic, I would laugh out loud at all this about Asperger's. Consider the following points:<p>1. Human evolution  is still going on, and in the long term, Asperger's might represent a positive evolutionary adaptation, especially in a world increasingly dependent on technology. Only nature knows, and nature doesn't reveal her secrets willingly.<p>2 After a recent epidemic of overdiagnoses, psychologists are reluctantly abandoning the Asperger's diagnosis -- it's being removed from the DSM. The reason? Too many people wanted the diagnosis -- it was the first truly fashionable mental illness. After all, Isaac Newton, Albert Einstein, and Bill Gates are/were thought to have this ""disease"".<p>3. There is a positive psychological trait called ""Grit"":<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grit_(personality_trait)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grit_(personality_trait)</a><p>People who have ""grit"" tend to focus on a few objectives, or just one, for months or years. It's a ""good thing"" -- psychologists say so. But the exact same behavior can lead to an Asperger's diagnosis. Have psychologists resolved this contradiction? Not remotely.<p>As far as I'm concerned, and in the opinion of an increasing number of psychologists, Asperger's refers to something real, but it shouldn't have been categorized as a mental illness -- unless intelligence should also be listed.<p>If psychology was a science this might all be different, but there's little hope for that.<p>More on this topic: <a href=""http://arachnoid.com/building_science"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arachnoid.com/building_science</a>",1365814065

5542024,comment,5539231,5540179,4,0,pyoung,,,"I think Singapore does so well because of the low taxes and because it is one of the few Asian countries in that region that isn't hampered by corruption.  Europe's economies are way too diverse to group together, some of them are 'business friendly', some of them are not.  The 'Celtic Tiger' was largely due to low taxes, and hasn't turned out too well (most of Europe is hurting right now), so I am not sure why we should aspire to emulate them.  Regulatory policies have little to do with their success (but a lot to do with their failures, in the case of Ireland).<p>I think most people agree that over-regulation is a bad thing.  What I take issue with is when political groups and lobbyists scream 'regulation makes us less competitive' anytime regulation is mentioned.  The fact is it might increase the costs of doing business a little bit, but it also might mean that my air and water aren't horribly polluted (see Beijing air quality) or that I can count on my retirement account actually being there when I need it.  I feel like one side is trying to find a good balance, while the other is being completely obstructionist.  The end result is watered down regulatory policies that increase the complexity and costs of doing business, while at the same time, being completely ineffective.  One major issue with this result is that this greatly benefits entrenched players, as they are already adept at navigating complex regulatory environments (which keep out new entrants) but in the end, they aren't actually affected by the regulations in any meaningful way.",1365814007

Both of which will drive up demand for bitcoins and thus legitimately move the price, due to supply being fairly constant and predictable.<p>When I say ""fundamentals"" I am using the financial form of the word, as in the method of valuation that contrasts to ""technical"" analysis by trying to examine what actually comprises the price of something rather than just looking for patterns in how it behaves. A good discussion of the ""fundamentals"" of a normal currency can be found here (most of which don't pertain to bitcoin, but just try to think analagously): <a href=""http://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/04/031704.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/04/031704.asp</a><p>I think you may also want to look into the ""functions of money"". As I was describing in my post, money doesn't serve just one purpose and while bitcoin is terrible at some of these, such as ""unit of account"", which all of: ""predict your profits, give forecasts to investors, make long-term plans"" fall under. On the other hand it actually functions fairly well as a means of exchange due to the fact that as prices fluctuate so can the value of the currency, something that physical currencies have a harder time doing. It isn't perfect and long term deals may require hedging, but as you allude to, there are ways to deal with this.<p>Hopefully this clarifies some of my points.<p>edit:some grammar",1365813958

By comparison, today's standard 10-percent-efficient solar panels generate about the same amount of power. That means Fan's radiative cooling panels could theoretically be substituted on rooftops where existing solar panels feed electricity to air conditioning systems needed to cool the building.</i><p>This isn't quite true. The electrically powered cooling system is likely driven by a heat pump with a coefficient of performance of around 3.5, meaning that it moves 3.5 times as much heat from inside to outside as it consumes electrical power.<p>If they can manufacture this for significantly cheaper than solar panels they might catch on, but it doesn't sound like the performance is competitive.

The price structure undermines the pricing of struggling freelancers trying to break out in the low- to mid-tier end of the market.  Bean-counting execs who don't care about design see no reason to pay $X000 or $XX000 to a pro designer with legitimate expenses when they can get several useable designs (I won't say ""good"") on spec for only $Y00.  Nevermind that many of those crowdsourced designs come from kids and people overseas using pirated versions of Photoshop.<p>Besides the economic damage wrought by 99Designs, a lot of designers have gotten a sour taste in their mouth from the blatant copying/IP theft that often wins.

That shit happens to guys all the time.<p>Yeah, sometimes people won't believe you.  And then they'll ask someone else.  And eventually they'll believe someone else, maybe.

But of course we know that both mean and median female heights are lower than male... the whole curve is offset by like 5"" in the USA.  It's totally plausible that the distribution of respect at technical skill discriminates in favour of males.  It's plausible that it doesn't, or that the effect is pretty small.

It proved we weren't insane for buying into Apple's lofty promised and developing for Mac OS X. So I probably loved that release the most. But of course, wouldn't run it today even if it ran on modern hardware.<p>But 10.6 is also well-loved, as the numbers above show. It is rock-solid stable, and I still run my OS X-based servers on 10.6 (in VMWare VMs). Company git servers, non-public facing IMAP archive servers, customer support systems, whatnot... all run 10.6.8, and have for years.<p>As an end user (by which I mean software developer, mostly Mac, with some iOS and web stuff) I run 10.8, but I still find it really irritating and like 10.7 better. There's so much annoying crap in 10.8, both showstopping bugs and UI changes aimed at the lower-knowledge average-Walmart-shopper tier of computer user, that it gets in my way more than it helps me.<p>But we've already discussed that stuff on this forum many times[2], so I won't rehash it here. I'll just say that so far, 10.8 has made me love it less, not more, than 10.7, so that is what I picked above. (And currently, it looks like I am the only one to have done so.)<p>Also, a real lion would kick a mountain lion's ass.<p>[1]: Jobs handled my snarky comment the same impressive way he used to handle irate shareholders at the annual meeting: he acknlowedged but implicit criticism but didn't validate it, he accepted and accentuated the praise, and then he invited the people listening to him to join him in feeling good about all the awesome things Apple was doing.<p>He looked at me and said, 'You know what?

Mac OS X 10.2: it's FINALLY really good.'

A drop in a bucket is .000625%, so I can't use that phrase and ""two thousand drops in a bucket"" doesn't have quite the right ring…<p><i>criminal</i>? You publicly defame me as a criminal‽ Maybe you meant to say <i>irresponsible</i> or something similar that  doesn't so directly involve libel laws. Let's save <i>criminal</i> for where it belongs, like BP's Deepwater Horizon spill.<p>I reject your assertion: <i>we don't, as a country, do a very good job of holding oil companies responsible for the maintenance and upkeep of their equipment</i> unless you can provide evidence. The EPA oversees cleanups which are notoriously expensive, deterring pipeline companies from accepting leaks as a cost of doing business. (The one I'm familiar with cost about $1000/gallon of leaked oil (mostly to experts and analysts, not so much to the guy with the shovel and buckets). Small leak, probably makes it on the high side per gallon.)<p>For another data point, when BP blew out some lines in Alaska in 2006 they spilled about 6000 barrels and were ultimately fined $20M. I'd like that fine to be higher, 20 times the value of the spilled product seems low.<p>Forgive a paragraph where I read about the Alaskan Pipeline, it's Saturday, the official day of HN meanderings:<p>I wanted to put a number about what percent of the Trans Alaskan pipeline oil leaks out, but I'm not finding a catalog of spills. From 1977 to 2010 it moved 16 billion barrels of oil, but I'm not finding the other half. There is a list at wikipedia, but it misses the 2006 BP spill, so I don't trust it to be complete. In 1978 someone blew a hole in the pipeline and leaked 16000 barrels, in 2001 some drunken numbnut with a rifle shot a hole in a weld and leaked 6000 barrels. He got 16 years in jail and was sentenced to pay $17M for the cleanup. I'm guessing he's still working that off. Unless they find more oil, or figure out how to make the pipeline work at lower than designed flow rates, the company that owns it has to remove all traces of the pipeline. Current projections suggest 2032 as the year for that decision.<p>Back on topic:<p>• Keep leaks to a minimum, but don't panic.<p>• Oil seeps are natural phenomena. The planet has survived millions of years with them.<p>• A pipeline leak screws up the local environment, but can be cleaned, and make sure to fine the pipeline folk enough that they don't want it to happen.<p>• Trucking the oil instead of using pipelines would be worse for the environment (I boldly propose without bothering to check the data).<p>• You know that car owners and farmers used to use their used motor oil as weed killer, right? Kept the weeds in the ditch down by dumping the oil in the drainage ditch. We have survived that, which was probably several times more oil per year than pipeline leaks. Heck I drove a Ford that leaked oil faster than my share of global pipeline leaks.<p>On barely related good news: The local gas company is <i>finally</i> addressing the methane leak they've had going in my yard for two years. It got big enough to attract their attention.",1365811399

8129743,comment,8129454,8129678,0,0,refurb,,,"I think the reason why Gilead&#x27;s drug is causing such an uproar is because it <i>is</i> worth the money, yet governments are tired of healthcare costs always going up.<p>A short summary of the issue:  In the past HCV had terrible treatments.  You would have to take interferon (makes you feel like you have the flu) for 8-12 months.  Plenty of patients took their chances on their disease not getting worse.  Even if you stuck it out, the cure rate was maybe 50%.  The total cost of therapy?  Around $80K (for most patients, others were much more expensive).<p>Gilead comes out with a wonder drug Solvaldi (it truly is revolutionary).  You still have to take interferon, but only for 12 weeks.  If you do tough it out, there is a 90% chance you&#x27;re cured.  The price?  A little more than than the $80K of the previous treatments.<p>Honestly, if you think about it, for a little more money, society is get a <i>much</i> greater benefit.  So what&#x27;s the big deal?<p>Well, because this drug works so well and has much better side effects, all those HCV patients who before said &quot;I&#x27;ll wait and see if HCV gets worse&quot; are now saying &quot;cure me!&quot;.  There are millions of HCV patients in the US, so if we tried to treat them all right now, it would bankrupt the system.<p>I can tell you exactly what will happen with Sovaldi and the newer drugs being launched later this year: governments and insurance companies will say &quot;no, unless you are very sick, you&#x27;re not getting this drug&quot;.  It will still cost the same to cure everyone, but it&#x27;ll just take longer.<p>Now, if you were Gilead, what would you do?  Especially if competitors were coming?  I know what I&#x27;d do, I&#x27;d go to Medicaid and Medicare and say &quot;lets make a deal, I&#x27;ll give you 50%, 60%, 70% off if you agree to let everyone get treated this year&quot;.  The gov&#x27;t would have to pay out a lot in one year, but they&#x27;d be getting a deal and Gilead would get their return.",1407113894

I see a lot of breaking news websites (or blogs that post a story whose details they &quot;update as details come in&quot; have no way (ok, maybe I just haven&#x27;t come across it) of retaining their readers -  a way to subscribe to subsequent updates.  So that means busy Bob will either completely forget to come back to the story letter or that he will search for the story again and go read on a competing publication.<p>So maybe a way for people to subscribe to these &quot;developing stories&quot;? An example implementation in WordPress would be that it adds next to the publish button a checkbox for indicating that this is a developing story.

Once you&#x27;ve found someone who you&#x27;re convinced is a better programmer, how do you convince them to join a company where they&#x27;d be the most skilled programmer (and thus have nobody to learn from)?

They accept design time input variables as a range, differing by an order of magnitude. If the &quot;assumptions aren’t met, performance deteriorates.&quot;  Throughput and delay look horrendous when the actual characteristics dont match the model.<p>> That being said, implementing a few pre-baked RemyCCs in major operating systems surely would help. Say you had a mobile&quot; (5Mbps 500ms) and &quot;home broadband&quot; (50Mbps 50ms) and &quot;LAN&quot; (1Gbps 5ms) RemyCC available in Lin/Mac/Win/And/IOS, TCP performance would be several times better than what we have today.<p>I&#x27;m also dubious of any actual adoption. However I believe youre underestimating the number of variant algorithms required. The consumer endpoints receive the vast bulk of the traffic, and are rarely contended on transmit.

L3 memory is made of the same stuff as registers but takes about 30 times longer to access. \n2. No, adding lots of dumb cores makes no sense.\n3. GPUs are useful because many tasks are embarrassingly parallel. Many more are not.\n4. &#x27;If we wrote better software&#x27; adding many more cores increases the difficulty of reasoning about software hugely. Many tasks are not easily performed in parallel, or the speedup is not impressive enough. Most operating systems (my guess is that OS X is included) will choke if you give them too many threads - performance drops hugely, or many threads are left totally idle. This is due to lock contention etc.\n5. Of course no-one &#x27;needs&#x27; that Haswell logic - but it&#x27;s sure nice having my computer do stuff quickly. My top-of-line phone struggles to play through its animations properly, and loading websites frequently takes a while. Good-enough is not really a good place to be. Furthermore, greater performance motivates more demanding applications.\n6. We dedicate everything to offsetting slow memory because it&#x27;s the only way to get good performance from the majority of tasks. Sure if your task can be handled by a GPU, by all means run it on a GPU.

The existing congestion & flow control mechanisms are quite simple. In contrast these &quot;algorithms have more than 150 rules.&quot; Additional state and computation time on the sender side is non trivial when managing tens or hundreds of thousands of concurrent flows.<p>These algorithms vary based on link/endpoint characteristics. This would require a priori knowledge of the path & quality to each TCP receiver in order to select an appropriate congestion control algorithm. This problem is probably tractable for large scale implementations. The number of unique networks an endpoint is exposed to is in the few million range, and roughly stable over time. Collapsing adjacent and similar networks would get down in to the tens of thousands of variant prefixes.<p>The characteristics of each prefix are roughly stable over time; a subnet of consumer cable endpoints does not flip to become a CDMA mobile subnet. At a guess the rate of change is 1-5% per day. If you can track the performance of millions of subnets a 1% delta per day is certainly feasible. In practice any single sender would need dozens, or hundreds, of different congestion control variants.<p>And lastly they appear to simulate receivers with similar network characteristics on a single contended link. In practice receivers will have wildly different characteristics. Traffic to mobile, consumer fixed line isp, and datacenter networks will all travel on common transit carriers. Additionally even a single IP endpoint can have variable hidden receivers; think 802.11, gbe, embedded clients, and a desktop OS behind a consumer NAT device. Now the sender must track, and adapt, congestion control <i>per flow</i>.<p>In summary synthetic testing of a simplistic use case has out performed generalized solutions. This should surprise no one. The details of practical implementation are ignored, and significant.",1407111340

Several people have already solved bufferbloat in theory, but it still exists in real life. Updating legacy devices, even with something as &quot;simple&quot; as a TCP congestion control module, may not be possible.<p>That being said, implementing a few pre-baked RemyCCs in major operating systems surely would help. Say you had a &quot;mobile&quot; (5Mbps 500ms) and &quot;home broadband&quot; (50Mbps 50ms) and &quot;LAN&quot; (1Gbps 5ms) RemyCC available in Lin/Mac/Win/And/IOS, TCP performance would be several times better than what we have today.",1407111090

It just\nwouldn&#x27;t make sense otherwise. From the link, it seems the point of\nslight fading the text-based submissions slightly was to discourage the\ntext-based submissions and also distinguish them from regular comments.<p>You also have a point regarding legibility. Since faded text is still\nreadable to me, I hadn&#x27;t thought of it in terms of legibility. Reduced\nlegibility does result in requiring increased effort, and many people\nsimply won&#x27;t bother. The real trouble with &quot;legibility&quot; is it&#x27;s highly\nsubjective due to depending on both the type and configuration of the\nsystem hardware being used, and the eyesight of the person attempting to\nuse it. Though most things try to be usable for people with &quot;average&quot;\neyesight, there are actually countless combinations of human visual\ncapacities, advantages, impairments, and preferences.<p>Since all we ever know is how our own eyes see things, we often forget\nhow the exact same thing can be vastly different for others. I might be\nable to see the faded text a whole lot easier than you can, or vice\nversa, so faded text could be extremely annoying for one, but only be\ntrivially inconvenient for the other. When I caught myself wondering if\nyour system was configured &quot;correctly,&quot; the supposedly &quot;obvious&quot; finally\ndawned on me; it&#x27;s probably a whole lot easier for me to read the faded\ntext than it is for you, so our difference of opinion could very well be\ndue to being unable to literally see things the same way the other does.<p>If faded text is extremely annoying and difficult for you to read, then\nplease contact me through email. I know great deal about accessibility\nissues and configuring systems/software to adjust for many different\ntypes of eyesight impairments and idiosyncrasies.",1407110992

For one, when the tenants know each other and have formed a consortium to allow their data to be aggregated, it&#x27;s not the kind of &quot;multi-tenant&quot; I had in mind. Now, instead of a bunch of independent renters, we have a condo association.<p>My first instinct in a situation like this would be to ask: &quot;Why not build a separate data warehouse and have some worker processes copy the clients&#x27; usage data over there, in batches or in a stream, raw or pre-processed as you prefer? Then the data can be be indexed however you want and JOINed with wild abandon, without further perturbing the individual client systems and their existing, presumably working architecture.&quot; Isn&#x27;t that the old-school IT way?

The source, meaning both source code and source of software, of software running on Synology hardware is not Synology.  Synology only makes the GUI client that runs on your machine that locally interfaces to the NAS box.<p>As to the Debian 2006 SSL problem... stuff happens... Apple had some silly security problems too, much more recently than 2006.  And Android is so full of holes, it&#x27;s a wonder the platform works at all...<p>However, when the generalized public buys a NAS product -- the vendor should indicate the potential security problems regarding &quot;cloud&quot; connections in big bold letters on the box and in the manual and have a large red warning that pops up in the user interface.

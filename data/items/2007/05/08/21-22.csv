So we can all split that evenly meaning $250 a person / per month. It is 24 hour access. And a realy really nice space. Best building and office in the area by far. It's a good temporary solution for developing your product because there is plenty of quite space and a conference room for use.",1178660759

It's fascinating to see how the simple act of wearing the camera changes his life - people talk to him differently, he gets invited to things, he's suddenly something of a celebrity just because of the presence of the camera. <p>But imagine that camera on Natalie Portman or Paris Hilton, or someone whose life is already incredibly out of the ordinary - while some of the charm is lost, it certainly would add a lot of intrigue. <p>There's also a lot of opportunity for using this kind of platform to do loosely narrative driven content: someone wears it for a single date, a job interview, to document a startup, to document making a film, etc. \n",1178660585

Most of the time he's walking around his apartment, or sitting on his couch playing with his laptop. he just doesn't have the charisma that somebody like Natalie Portman likely has. \n",1178659907

Generally, economic returns accrue to those who do the difficult parts; it's far more difficult to start a Web 2.0 company than setup a blog, so far more gain accrues to the users of this than the blog itself.<p>I, for one, plan to use it as soon as we launch our startup.  Unfortunately it's not much good if you're not ready for traffic, but I think it'll be a nifty added source of exposure.",1178659154

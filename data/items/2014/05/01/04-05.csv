There is a general human race intelligence eather where ideas boil and and when one particular human comes up with an idea, there are probably 10 others that at the same time have the same idea.

Einstein was genius, but even his work was incremental [1].<p>Why I am saying this - we applied to YC this year with exactly same idea.

In days of yore (the Apple Newton) these vectors were in ROM.<p>On the Newton, our memory management guy (hi, Bob!) went the extra mile and made sure that MMU mappings weren&#x27;t mapped; you had to run a piece of code that was mapped in the same location physically as well as virtually that turned off the MMU, frobbed the page tables, and then turned translation on again. The theory was that we kept patches in battery-backed RAM, and we wanted to dramatically reduce the chance that they could be over-written, even by the kernel.<p>Not really sure the extra complexity was worth it, but I never heard of a Newton losing its patches short of utterly exhausting the backup battery.

Just because industry has started taking design seriously doesn&#x27;t mean we should suddenly expect most startups or apps succeed.

Conflating functions with constructors was stupid. Why should there only be one possible constructor for a class, anyway?<p>And it&#x27;s a terrible idea for constructors to try to silently correct mistakes that programmers make calling them in the wrong way, instead of asserting an error, because you know damn well those programmers are making that same mistake all over the place, and lots of other constructors don&#x27;t try to correct the mistake of calling them directly as functions.<p>The idea of using functions as constructors, but requiring them to be called with &quot;new&quot;, yet still allowing those functions to be called as normal functions, which seems like a very reasonable thing to do, especially if you&#x27;re coming from Python, is the other incredibly idiotic JavaScript design flaw, up there with &quot;this&quot;. It&#x27;s like having a gaping wound that never heals and is just waiting for another infection to come along.<p>The other stupid thing about JavaScript is the idea that a subclass should inherit from an INSTANCE of its superclass, instead of from the superclass directly. Why insert one extra level of indirection and waste the time and memory and simplicity? And why require that the constructor of all classes that you might ever subclass be callable with no arguments to create a dummy intermediate instance through which a subclass can inherit its class? That puts restrictions on and adds needless complexity to how constructors work.<p>JavaScript was NOT a clearly thought out language, and it&#x27;s insulting to Self to claim that Self was its inspiration, when there&#x27;s no good way to dynamically change the prototypes an object inherits from at runtime, and an object can only inherit from one prototype. Self is SO SIMPLE and SO EASY to understand, yet JavaScript is so confusing, that comparing it to Self just sets you up to be surprised and disappointed if you know Self, or think badly of Self if you only know JavaScript.<p>And don&#x27;t even get me started about JavaScript&#x27;s and Brendan Eich&#x27;s misconceptions about equality.<p>It&#x27;s really a shame, because the fuzzy magical thinking that went into JavaScript made it a lot more complex and error prone that it would have been otherwise, if only it had been designed by somebody who knew what they were doing and learned from other language&#x27;s mistakes without aping other language&#x27;s mistakes, instead of having such a cargo cult design, and then having a cargo cult name slapped on to mislead people into thinking it had something to do with Java, which WAS written by somebody who knew what they were doing.",1398918252

This point cannot possibly more clearly illustrated than the shenanigans going on in Ukraine at this very instant. Russia of five years ago would <i>never</i> have made as provocative move as they did had they not believed the US and its allies incapable of responding. Russia, in the form of Vladimir Putin, feels very much like someone who can get away with annexing a neighboring country for the same reasons that Hitler was ok with annexing <i>his</i> neighboring countries. The belief that the will to act would not overcome the potential cost of acting.<p>An emergent China <i>will</i> annex Taiwan and it will not be so that they can lift up the Taiwanese citizens, it will because they <i>can</i>, citizens be damned. They will also annex large regions of the border with India, same reasoning. They will do this, and potentially succeed in doing so, by virtue of their place as the pre-eminent economy on the planet. Defy them and they don&#x27;t have to fire a shot to take out your economy, they just have to cut trade with your economy and blammo, recession if not depression time.<p>In grade school, the class doesn&#x27;t get together and elect the class bully. The class bully takes that position by beating up or intimidating everyone else. Basically being the baddest actor in the set of possible actors. What the Economist alludes to with their pithy &quot;Pacific Century&quot; is that the China, as the largest economy, gets to be the boss. Not because they were elected, but because they can punish folks who don&#x27;t toe the line, just as the US has repeatedly done to people over the last 50 years. I could give you lots of examples real or hypothesized, but the key is the weaker economy risks more in a showdown than the stronger one does, and <i>that</i> has been the basis for world governance and policy since 1948.<p>The one line summary of the Economist article is &quot;When China&#x27;s economy exceeds that of the US, China will be calling the policy shots on the world stage, not the US.&quot; It is that ability to shape world policy that will make them the new &#x27;boss&#x27; not some imagined contest between horses.<p>My guess is that you should care in a deep way because China has a different opinion on what constitutes &#x27;human rights&#x27; than the current world order does.",1398917471

It was a terribly idiotic design decision, because the variable you&#x27;d want to close over most of the time is &quot;this&quot;, but since it&#x27;s not a variable, you can&#x27;t close over it -- it&#x27;s dynamically bound, in a really stupid way.<p>It&#x27;s the cause of a lion&#x27;s share of JavaScript bugs. No matter how well you know JavaScript, and how pedantically you understand how &quot;this&quot; works and why it&#x27;s such a terrible design flaw, you will ALWAYS make mistakes with it, and you will ALWAYS have to go carefully over your code line by line looking for misuses of &quot;this&quot;.<p>Whenever your JavaScript program is misbehaving, the first thing you should do is to search the relevant code for &quot;this&quot;, and think carefully about how it might be bound. And even if your JavaScript program is not misbehaving in a way you can detect, you should still do that anyway, because it might just have some very subtle bugs caused by &quot;this&quot;.<p>I&#x27;ve been writing code that starts out with &quot;var self = this;&quot; and then ONLY using &quot;self&quot; and NEVER using &quot;this&quot; except for the first line of a function that goes &quot;var self = this;&quot;. That way there&#x27;s a lot less chance of making mistakes, although it&#x27;s still possible for that first &quot;this&quot; to be incorrectly bound -- you only want to do the &quot;var self = this;&quot; in top level functions, and all functions contained in them should use self and never use &quot;this&quot;.",1398917205

As far as size goes you would be subject to local building codes of course.<p>Once you get into active jamming however that requires you to transmit and to transmit you need a license from the FCC.  The right to transmit anywhere in the US is under the FCC&#x27;s jurisdiction and doesn&#x27;t have anything to do with the landowner.  It may seem strange to divorce airwave rights from property rights but it&#x27;s not that different from water rights or mineral rights or airspace rights, which have a long legal history of being divorced from landowner rights.<p>When you open your faraday cage to the public it gets a little tricky too, because if a &quot;licensee&quot; has the legal right to be somewhere according to you and the legal right to transmit or receive according to the FCC then you can&#x27;t really legally prevent them from doing both at the same time.  This idea, which is called the &quot;OTARD rule&quot; in some situations, is interpreted to force landlords to allow tenants to install WiFi and satellite equipment on rented property for example.<p>There probably is an FCC rule that would prevent stores or movie theaters or similar public places from jamming via a Faraday cage, but since actively jamming is cheaper I am not aware of any actual instances of this type.

Microsoft, Google, Facebook can work on thwarting surveillance while having to continue to cooperate with the US government and while still be in need of it&#x27;s protection and knowledge to thwart attacks against their own corporate resources and interests, or in short politics.\nAnd yes the criticism of Greenwald for saying, yes most likely US spies care about national security and do their job rather than attempt instituting some shadow government on the behest of shape shifting lizard aliens is also pretty stupid.",1448971010

As more people switch to e-cigs, which are not taxed and offer big cost savings, states are talking about taxing e-cigarettes similarly.<p>If the goal of the cigarette tax was harm reduction, presumably there&#x27;s some incentive to have people smoke e-cigarettes instead of regular tobacco - but the real concern is the loss of the tax revenue the state has come to depend on.

Those of us at high levels at Mozilla believed someone at or near board level who had recently left the company was sending rumors to Barr.<p>This WSJ story broke on March 28th, and it was summarized at that end of my first week as CEO as &quot;board members resigned a week ago&quot;, but then one more week passed, and the Prop 8 story grew bigger due to okcupid, and the &quot;week ago&quot; became bogusly rewritten (&quot;retconned&quot;) in many online accounts and comment threads as &quot;three board members resigned over Prop 8&quot;.<p>That never happened.

This fact alone has made their idea worth less, and even years after Uber started you can outperform Uber.<p>Uber for Food, with a proper implementation of dynamic vehicle routing problem algorithms can kick Uber&#x27;s ass.<p>Unfortunately for those who are not idea executors, the science, the research behind those logistics problems is still immature, and to make &quot;Uber for Food&quot; idea work, you have to have a large knowledge of computer architecture, above average problem solving capabilities, and a pretty darn fast implementation of those algorithms.<p>That&#x27;s something Uber can do now, after they employ excellent people, but the problem with large companies is that after some time, they lose direction, they slow down, and that&#x27;s why you can copy them.<p>Look at Homejoy, &quot;Uber for Cleaning Services&quot;.\nTheir ultimate challenge was exactly the same that Uber has, logistics algorithms. They failed at proper fast implementation, and failed ultimately.\nUber has more money, thus more momentum, but they can still fail, because idea is just an idea.",1448968435

All you have to do is remember what your own data looks like for a short time.  Most code will not be shared with outsiders and most people want to impede their coworkers rather than do extra work to make things easier.  so the mentality is &quot;why not use JavaScript for everything.&quot;",1370793577

False dichotomies are things like &quot;if you&#x27;re not with us, you&#x27;re against us&quot;, or &quot;The new research shows that one part of the theory of evolution is wrong, therefore creationism is right&quot;. There&#x27;s nothing like this here; his was a simple statement of the form &quot;X is not bad, because Y is even worse&quot;. See the difference? False dichotomy means (falsely) asserting that when you disprove the <i>factuality</i> of one alternative, only one other alternative remains and therefore it&#x27;s automatically true.

My claim is that most dietary choices beyond a reasonable intake of calories and more or less &quot;normal&quot; food is magical thinking and worse -- it&#x27;s pseudoscience. This includes what we know about human physiology. We know how some systems work, but we don&#x27;t know much about how they interact. Suppose fiber helps to move waste through the intestines. But does it have other effects as well? Is it good overall? And suppose it is good overall -- just <i>how good</i> is it? Is it even worth the effort of consciously increasing your green vegetable consumption by 10%? This last point is the crucial one, because I&#x27;m trying to show that when it comes to food, some people actively change their behavior based on conjectures, or little evidence.<p>BTW, what I like most about John Ioannidis&#x27;s work is that he not only proved theoretically that most medical research is false, but he showed it empirically: He showed that a large percentage of papers in the best regarded medical journal turned out to either be completely false, or to have a much reduced effect-size. Some of these papers suggested practices that, at the time, were considered &quot;probably good&quot; choices, and have since been shown to be anything but.<p>What I was saying about purity had nothing to do with psychoanalysis. Not all psychology and anthropology is psychoanalysis, and I suggest you take a look at Haidt&#x27;s research. At the very least, it&#x27;s thought provoking.<p>Lastly, I&#x27;m not taking a hyper-rational stance. I&#x27;ve long ago realized that I, like all people, am far from rational. I am superstitious myself, and about stranger things than food. I just think that the rise of the food religion among the educated liberal elite is interesting. I am very much interested in the history of religion and mysticism, and I always find it fascinating how magic works its way back into our lives -- contrary to Max Weber&#x27;s assertion -- no matter our background. Haidt&#x27;s theory of values is one especially interesting framework through which to examine this phenomenon.",1370791554

Is there any evidence, weak as it may be, that FRUIT consumption is harmful in any way? (note: not that FRUCTOSE consumption is harmful. I&#x27;m aware of that. I&#x27;m looking specifically for FRUIT consumption).<p>> the difference between wild apples, cherries and strawberries and the ones you can buy in the supermarket.<p>Anecdotal, of course, but while I haven&#x27;t had a chance to pick wild apples or cherries, I did have a chance to pick wile strawberries, raspberries and blackberries - and they were just as sweet and perhaps even sweeter than those I buy at the supermarket. They _were_ much smaller and not as nice looking, but were extremely sweet. Similarly for grapes.<p>I know for sure that e.g. industrially grown tomatoes have been optimized for size and looks at the EXPENSE of sugar (and other nutriet) content. This might also be true for other fruits and vegetables.<p>> NaCl is salt so it is chemically quite inert<p>That&#x27;s exactly my point. It&#x27;s possible that fruit is &quot;inert&quot; in its sugar effect - studies about pure fructose consumption are potentially irrelevant.<p>> But if you are a person with the metabolic syndrome, high insulin resistance or type 2 diabetes you just cannot assume that a diet of only bananas, ultra sweet apples, pomelo, peaches etc will do you much good.<p>Of course, but that&#x27;s begging the question. If you are a person who suffers from hypertension, than you cannot assume that regular salt intake is good for you! But it is, for 80% of the cases - the remaining 20% being the salt-sensitive hypertension people.<p>You cannot assume that such a fruit diet will do much bad either. Doing so is blind faith. And that&#x27;s exactly pron&#x27;s point.<p>> Ask someone with great knowledge about human metabolism specifically for your case.<p>I&#x27;ve been looking for someone like that, but it seems that there are non to be found. Specifically, everything about my metabolism falls outside accepted wisdom; You&#x27;d expect the experts to want to look at evidence contradicting their predictions to learn to improve their predictions - but after talking to 30 or so &quot;experts&quot;, I have not found one who has such an interest.",1370790457

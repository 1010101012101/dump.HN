8565818,comment,8565161,8565704,0,0,glitch,,,"mDNS has utility in small networks for your average Joe.  In these circumstances (1) it shouldn&#x27;t be a problem, (2) it shouldn&#x27;t flood (there&#x27;s logarithmic decay and there actually has been thought put into this), (3) names are discoverable without relying on anything else, (4) and it does its job in being the mechanism for DNS-SD to piggyback on so that services can be discovered automatically.  Being independent of other services working or not — e.g., DHCP, (unicast) DNS — means &quot;it just works&quot;, even if other network services fail.<p>There is a beauty in the ability to just have all of your computers, printers, and peripheral devices otherwise plug into a switch (without any additional network service equipment — no router/dns/dhcp multi-combo device added in the mix) and that everything just ends up working.  Link-local addressing takes care of IPs, mDNS takes care of names, and DNS-SD through mDNS takes care of automatic service advertisement — &quot;Hey, I&#x27;m a printer, use me if ya wanna!&quot;<p>Further, failure of proper mDNS implementation in a device (perhaps resulting in malformed packets or over-zealous flooding) is just a failure of that device&#x27;s design, not mDNS per se.<p>Having said that, still... yes, I think the home/SOHO router/switch/access-point/dns/dhcp multi-combo device should handle DNS-SD registrations and DNS, and that mDNS shouldn&#x27;t be needed.<p>In medium/large networks (those actually managed by someone putting on an IT hat), it&#x27;s perhaps not as appropriate, but still shouldn&#x27;t be a problem assuming everything is subnetted with mDNS in mind.  Of course, name resolution is handled by unicast DNS, and with regard to service discovery in this context, someone manages the DNS-SD records on the unicast DNS server so you don&#x27;t need mDNS to be the mule for DNS-SD to ride on in those circumstances.",1415249076

8565812,comment,8562449,8565288,0,0,lobster_johnson,,,"As I understand Angular, objects are mutable, and Angular must perform deep dirty checks on every object to be perfectly consistent. As pointed out by the author of the blog post, this needs to be repeated until there are no more changes detected. That&#x27;s the whole point of Angular&#x27;s digest loop.<p>React&#x27;s data model is much simpler, at least at a high level. State changes are explicit, and data is immutable. This means that whenever you give a component new props, it can simply do a deep comparison of the data with the previous version and mark the component as dirty if it&#x27;s changed. (Setting a new state always triggers a re-render, no matter if the data is different or not.) Since data changes only happen explicitly, and flow naturally through component nesting, it doesn&#x27;t need process a lot of data to figure out what needs to be updated.<p>The list of dirty components is then processed to produce the virtual DOM, which is then diffed against the real DOM. Doing anything with the real DOM is expensive, whereas the virtual DOM is extremely fast. So is building the virtual DOM; while it&#x27;s true that a component&#x27;s render() method needs to build its own tree every time it&#x27;s called, re-rendering is extremely fast, even if you actually change state near the root of the virtual DOM (which causes a bigger cascade of dirty checks). Current JS engines are capable of creating tens of thousands of objects in just a few milliseconds.<p>(There are a few of optimization tricks you can use to avoid renders, too. In particular, there is PureRenderMixin, which declares that your component is &quot;pure&quot;, meaning that given the same props and state, it will always render the same tree, allowing React to do shallower checks to determine if a render is needed.)",1415248981

That means that selling to both can add $9 worth of value.  Who should capture that new $9 of value?  How should it be divided?<p>If the price is $10 uniformly, then the seller gets no value from selling, A gets $3 of value, and B gets $6 of value.<p>If the price is $12 uniformly, the seller gets $4 of value, A gets $1 of value and B gets $4 of value.<p>If the price is $14 uniformly, A won&#x27;t buy, the seller gets $4 of value, and B gets $2 of value.<p>If the seller can divine the true value to A and B and set the price to $12.99 for A and $15.99 for B, then the seller can capture essentially ALL of the value available in the exchange.<p>It definitely seems there are many cases where price discrimination creates more value.

8565739,comment,8562449,8562449,0,0,lobster_johnson,,,"Coincidentally, the scoping issue is almost exactly the same issue that plagued Zope, a Python-based app server, back in the day.<p>In Zope, any property could be inherited not just from the parent object, but from the current context; you could invoke the object path &quot;a.b&quot; and b would inherit from b, but if you invoked the object path &quot;a.c.b&quot;, b would inherit from c instead. They called this design pattern &quot;acquisition&quot;, and seemed rather proud of it until they realized it was the kind of magic that was ultimately too magical for its own good.<p>The Zope guys tried very hard to eradicate it, and in the process ended up alienating all the developers with the new, non-backwards-compatible version. Funnily enough, there is another Angular parallel to Zope: Just like Zope 3, AngularJS 2.0 is also not backwards-compatible.<p>Angular&#x27;s parameter-based dependency injection is coincidentally the same reason Martini [1] is slower than most other Golang web frameworks. Clever, sure, but ultimately a design flaw.<p>These problems demonstrate how important it is to introduce a good design from the very beginning. You can fix bad code, but bad design is much harder to change.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/go-martini/martini#service-injection"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/go-martini/martini#service-injection</a>",1415246613

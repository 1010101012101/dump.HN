But if you're no better than the people\nworking for free, you can only charge for things\nthey're unwilling to do.<p>E.g. if you're really good (for some definition of\ngood) you can make money playing your own songs.

258355,comment,258282,258282,0,0,Allocator2008,,,"I think for me broadly, the answer lies in the fact that the laws of nature are necessary, whereas software is contingent. For example, perhaps a bug happens because of running out of memory, thus the software running properly is contingent on the memory. But on the other hand, gravity, for example, is necessary, in that it is not contingent on anything to make it work. It just works. So for me I think the reason software has bugs, but nature doesn't, is that the former is a contingent phenomena, the latter a necessary one.",1217185035
258354,comment,258154,258251,0,0,donw,,,"We agree totally on nuclear power.<p>I think that the concerns about feeding the starving people in impoverished countries should be better-directed at their governments.  In many cases, food supplied as aid by the U.S. and U.N. is either rejected outright due to political bias, sold on the open market to produce money for corrupt officials, or left to rot in warehouses due to the local government not doing anything to put infrastructure in place  to move 'the food' to 'the starving people'.<p>I'm not an advocate for biofuels, but making the argument that biofuel production is a direct cause of world starvation is more than a little far-fetched; the causes are complex, and more political than technological in origin, much like the failings of the nuclear power industry in the States.<p>Also don't ignore that, in the U.S., a great deal of arable land goes to waste because of government farm subsidies and other political buggery.<p>For the sake of playing with some numbers, let's assume that a reasonably efficient car, powered by ethanol, would require ten gallons of fuel per week, or around five hundred gallons per year.  That's two acres per car, per year.  There are approximately sixty million registered cars in the U.S., requiring a hundred and twenty million acres of farmland be dedicated to producing fuel for these cars, and this is only if the cars ran solely on ethanol.<p>So, if every car in the US were to run on Ethanol, it would consume one-fifth of the total agricultural production capacity.<p>Also note that some quick Googling for me shows that yields might be almost double the 250 gallons/acre number for biofuels.<p>This doesn't mean that biofuels are the ideal solution, but they are certainly a strong contender.<p>Actually, I may have just become a biofuel advocate.  The technology to build flex-fuel cars exists <i>now</i>, and can take advantage of the existing transportation infrastructure until such time as a better means, be it hydrogen, super-capacitors, or dilithium crystals, is available.  Doing so would reduce dependence on foreign oil, help boost the national economy, and would likely have the positive side effect of promoting research into increasing long-term, sustainable, high crop yields.",1217185015

The simple reaction-time experiment is to hold a ruler in front of someone, so it hangs down; they have a hand wrapped around (but not touching) the end of the ruler. You let go, they grab it, you measure how far it fell to see how fast they reacted.<p>The thing is, some people will <i>start</i> to grab it fast (high mental reaction time) and other people will <i>actually touch it</i> sooner (slow mental reaction time, faster physical reaction time). If you're running in a zig-zag pattern, this would mean that you would start turning faster, though other people might be able to execute a complete turn (start to finish) faster despite lower IQ.",1217183608

In other words, complete systems are incomplete.<p>This does not mean that complete systems cannot model reality to a high degree -- there's no reason why a ToE could pop out from some rotation or transmutation of mathematics. It just means there would be parts of it that would be incomplete -- the model itself could have a very high degree of fidelity.<p>When applied to higher math and physics, this is another way of saying ""you don't know what you don't know"" ie, the models can work perfectly across all observation space and still be true to Godel.",1217182826

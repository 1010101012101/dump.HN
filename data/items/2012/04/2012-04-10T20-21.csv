Sure, you get a little more information (good for webpages and maps as shown) but at what cost? If they were to modify the aspect ratio to expand the screen while conforming to their retina spec, it would make more sense just to transition to 16:10(8:5). At the very least, they could do it in a way that makes it more consistent with desktop applications.<p>The best thing the 3:2 ratio has going for it is making portrait orientation feel just a tad friendlier than a reporter's notebook, at least when viewing horizontal media.",1334091589

Snap has snaplets, Pyramid has components.<p>Happstack on the other hand ... invented type-safe routing, which I haven't seen anywhere else before it. Dynamic languages tend to have something vaguely similar you might call ""named routes"" but they don't provide the same static guarantees.<p>Happstack likes to use templates mixed in with code, which sounds insane but note that this is rather different from code mixed in with templates. This templating is type-safe and syntactically checked at compile time, and allows reusing all of Haskell rather than a limited subset, so using modules and functions these templates easily end up more modular and composable than any template language you've ever seen before. Admittedly, it's not the most designer-friendly solution (but should designers really mess with the HTML to begin with?).<p>Happstack likes to use a persistence system for native Haskell values. I suppose you could say this is similar to ZODB with Pyramid, although it's ""on steroids"" (due to Haskell).<p>I'm biased towards Happstack as you might notice from this post, but the point I'm trying to make is more that Happstack is non-traditional (in the tradition of Haskell!) and not quite like anything else. This is often seen as a weakness because it means it is less familiar to new users; I might wonder why they're using Haskell to begin with, then. :-)<p>(You could even argue that Happstack should be more familiar, to Haskell programmers, because it favors reuse of existing Haskell idioms like combinators, algebraic data types, monad transformer stacks...)<p>That said, if you do want a more traditional framework, Snap and Yesod are both great options.",1334090930

I hear a lot of very generic counter-arguments that are really only designed to halt the conversation immediately. Dont pull these on me, please. :(<p>>>>Do not tell me that good developers can write good code in any language, or bad developers blah blah. That doesnt mean anything. A good carpenter can drive in a nail with either a rock or a hammer, but how many carpenters do you see bashing stuff with rocks? Part of what makes a good developer is the ability to choose the tools that work best.<p>>>>Do not tell me that its the developers responsibility to memorize a thousand strange exceptions and surprising behaviors. Yes, this is necessary in any system, because computers suck. That doesnt mean theres no upper limit for how much zaniness is acceptable in a system. PHP is nothing but exceptions, and it is not okay when wrestling the language takes more effort than actually writing your program. My tools should not create net positive work for me to do.<p>That's not even deep in the article!

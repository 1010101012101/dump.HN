Economies are much more dynamic than that, and while it&#x27;s true some may suffer in the short-run, it&#x27;s wouldn&#x27;t be like that forever.<p>At one point the US was primarily an agrarian society, and more than 90% of labor worked on a farm. Imagine telling someone from that society that some day, tech would allow less than 2% of the workforce to produce many times more food than the current total output.

Indeed, it&#x27;s worth noting that most (every single major one) database systems actually write to a sequential transaction log (which they do not have to checkpoint every n-bytes), and only on commit do they actually then make a strategy for changing those source pages and extents, unrolling it from the log and checkpointing it, which by default includes coalescing and combining strategies. The idea that databases are randomly writing small bits of data all over the place is simply wrong, but is the entire foundation of almost every comment in this thread.<p><a href=""https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa337560%28v=sql.105%29.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa337560%28v=sql...</a><p>As one example.

Honestly, Rich Hickey is one of my programming heros and I&#x27;m a big fan of his ideas about programming. However, reading the response below, I couldn&#x27;t help but feel disheartened.<p>Rich Hickey says - <i>You don&#x27;t level up by switching games all the time, but by sticking with one long enough to gain advanced skills. And, you need to be careful to recognize the actual game involved. Programming mastery has little to do with languages, paradigms, platforms, building blocks, open source, conferences etc</i>.<p>Quite seriously, this is more or less opposite of what I&#x27;ve lived by in my career till now. As a backend engineer I can&#x27;t help not getting excited by React or not spending a month learning OCaml or building side-projects tangential to my 9-5 line of work. The worst part is, that till now I always felt that it is a sure fire way to level up as a developer.<p>The confusing part is that Peter Norvig, another great programmer has quite the opposite to say[1] (although one can argue that overall they mean the same) - <i>Learn at least a half dozen programming languages. Include one language that emphasizes class abstractions (like Java or C++), one that emphasizes functional abstraction (like Lisp or ML or Haskell), one that supports declarative specifications (like Prolog or C++ templates), and one that emphasizes parallelism (like Clojure or Go).</i><p>At this point, I&#x27;m really confused and I spent better part of the day mulling over whether I should go through the lectures of a recent Coursera course that I&#x27;m doing or should I dive deeper in my current stack e.g. Python / Django.<p>What are your thoughts?

I would say it&#x27;s due to the differences in boundaries.<p>For example, Black Box tools have it simple. Capture anything that crosses in the direction of Black to White. Capturing what goes from White to Black is much harder, though, since there are less visible boundaries on what can be accessed. For example - if I write a black box which utilizes a environment variable, you have to be tracking what memory a program accesses to see this from outside the program.<p>White boxes, on the other hand, have very few boundaries, and those which exist are fuzzy at best. Sure, there are technically functions and modules and scopes, but these boundaries are soft; frequently and easily pierced. Global variables, shared memory, inlined functions, tail call optimization, continuation passing... all of these make it incredibly difficult to reason about and trace program flow, because the program flow depends so heavily on the global context.<p>Functionally pure programming paradigms might be our best bet in the long run: when a &quot;function&quot; produces deterministic output for given input, we suddenly create a network of predictable black boxes within our white box, giving us the edges we need in order to implement our tracing and automated reasoning tools.",1424112170

They were all enabled by global trade, driving demand for foreign goods, prompting responses that produced innovations that swept whomever was at the forefront of the world in decades.<p>The size of the world changes - and gets broader - but the mechanism at play, that the concentrated powers of the world fuel each others innovations and those innovations catapult advancement but also introduce huge power vacuums between those nations adopting the new and those nations outside the sphere of influence - something I would not say was missing in the computer revolution, since the adoption of computer technology happened first and is still only pervasive in first world nations. The third world is still late to the party and comes in with fractured infrastructure and access, where systemic access and ubiquity enabled the Internet and a lot of the current revolutions in the first place.<p>In previous instances, the cost savings made the nations that had them superpowers in their times. The cotton gin is a huge part of why America went from an English vassal to a world power - between the innovations and the raw resources of the Americas, it could propagate empire.<p>But those profits just made men rich. The cotton, tobacco, industrial, automotive, oil, etc barons were the kings of their times through the innovations and automations of their industries. That has never really changed, those ruling over the industries being modernized always reap unfathomable wealth and power from the enterprise. Their wealth made their country rich, but the laborers still had to find something else to do every time, and up until now we have always had some unskilled menial and physical thing to have <i>most</i> people do. In actuality, we ran into that wall probably seventy years ago in the aftermath of World War 2 - as the US at least rapidly adopted women and minorities into the whole workforce the huge surge of productive labor combined with the green revolution, the reforms of the late industrial giving workers reasonable hours, unions, and power over their lives, plus the fledgling technological revolution that had already produced a lot of wonders (consumer refrigeration, microwaves, clothes washers and dryers, etc) had already crippled the low skill labor market and we collectively adapted by organically injecting superfluous bureaucracy in almost every business and part of life to make up for the work shortage.<p>Problem is that we did that, became a &quot;service&quot; economy, and are now faced with the obsolescence of busy office work. I can just remember CGPGrey talking about it in Humans Need Not Apply, in how the prime target for automation is not the McDonalds burger flipper but every middle income office worker who can be replaced by software. After bureaucracy, where do we inject the overflow labor of humanity? Or do we finally admit we don&#x27;t need everyone laboring?",1424112024

It looks like everyone is trying to sweep this under the carpet and hopes this way, sexism in tech will go away. It won&#x27;t.<p>A major reason for that is, because right now, men are only told what is NOT okay, without telling them what IS okay. This makes a lot of men behave very strangely in towards women. Firstly, because they don&#x27;t want to appear sexist for the woman&#x27;s sake and secondly, because they don&#x27;t want to be accused of sexual harassment. Women feel this and for that reason feel unwelcome in tech. It seems like no one tries to reference any gender study researxh even though this is such a huge problem in tech and is holding up our industry.<p>A way to solve this, would be starting to create an open culture about how men and women can work together in tech, NOT leaving out the whole dating aspect.<p>A first step into this direction would be to clarify what IS okay and not only what is NOT okay.<p>For instance, telling a woman she is gorgeous without asking for anything in return is okay. Then the woman can make up her mind if she is interested or not. This is how it works and it will happen anHowever, basing a business transaction on sexual favours is not tolerated.<p>This has to be more specific of course, however, the only guideline being &quot;inappropriate behaviour won&#x27;t be tolerated&quot; is just not enough to solve sexism in tech and to get more women into tech.",1424111502

9058291,comment,9057996,9057996,0,0,hooande,,,"The correlation between software and large scale loss of jobs is far from proven. The US unemployment rate fluctuates wildly based on many factors [0], but ~30 years or so into the software revolution it isn&#x27;t too much higher than it has been historically. Parkinson&#x27;s Law may be the answer to the threat of large scale job loss. There&#x27;s a long list of startups who have raised hundreds of millions of dollars in funding because &quot;money is cheap right now&quot; and proceeded to hire offices full of people with a wide variety of titles. If the leaders of the tech industry are willing to hire for the sake of hiring, the overall economy is probably safe for just a little while longer. The prevailing wisdom is that rational actors won&#x27;t spend money to hire people that aren&#x27;t essential to their business, and they&#x27;ll opt to use software instead of people if the software is cheaper. In practice these so called rational actors often use any savings from software to hire more people, whether they are essential or not. Part of it is because there&#x27;s always something that could be done, and another part is that having a lot of employees makes people feel good about themselves. Whatever the motivation, mass unemployment is most likely a problem that will take care of itself.<p>In the context of this essay the term &quot;concentration of power&quot; seems to mean the ability of a small group to have an outsized (and harmful) influence. This seems like a much larger problem than unemployment, but it isn&#x27;t limited to technology. A network of a few hundred terrorists or just five guys in france can bring cities to a halt and affect the psyche of entire countries. It&#x27;s just something that we&#x27;re going through right now as a global culture, and I don&#x27;t see any quick fixes. It is clear that the threat of malevolent AI is greatly overhyped, and I can&#x27;t wait until the zeitgeist moves on to another flavor of the month criss du jour. There are very real threats facing the world right now and we shouldn&#x27;t spend too much time worrying about something that might or might not happen, that we couldn&#x27;t stop even if wanted to. Synthetic biology probably falls into the same category, though the ability to manufacture deadly viruses is based much more firmly in fact.<p>Guns, bombs, computers and the basic building blocks of life cannot be made illegal and confiscated en masse. One of the best ways to solve the threats posed by technology is to take the idea of income inequality, mentioned in this essay, very seriously. We&#x27;ve created a culture where people measure their self worth by the value of the companies they found. When I talk to people about technology, I don&#x27;t hear about the large and small advances that make our lives a little bit better every day. I hear, &quot;Isn&#x27;t it crazy that Instagram was worth $XX billion dollars? I want to start a company and make that much too!&quot;. This is poison and it has to stop. If we place all the emphasis on who made what, we create a world where a lot of people get left out and forgotten. Then they spend their time in dark basements, watching extremist videos and working carelessly with dangerous tools. We need to turn technology into something that has benefits for everyone, in order to protect ourselves and our loved ones from some of its most dire consequences.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0104719.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0104719.html</a>",1424111130

The industrial revolution gets a really bad rap, but compared to the work and life expectancy that preceded it, the condition of workers improved dramatically in the 19th century.<p>The tendency in all technological revolutions is to reduce the amount of exertion performed by workers and increase the wealth available for consumption (and correspondingly reduce its price).

The other revolutions were not too different in terms of taking something which a huge amount of people were doing and what society was focused on producing people to do and making it trivial (or at least to involve much fewer people). The overall impact of the industrial and agricultural revolutions were to ultimately create more jobs even if it was a wild ride while things were rapidly changing.<p>This revolution is different - now mechanical horsepower can be applied to tasks previously only possible through human minds which is quite different from machines or farming - but how different is it? It would take some really visionary people to figure out what the ultimate impacts of all of this are really going to be - and to try to imagine what people are going to do for a living or what society will look like on the other side.<p>My personal view is that AI is a pretty important component of this. I think, in principle, it&#x27;s possible. But can it actually be done? That would be a pretty insane change and it&#x27;s super hard to image what that will be like. But if AI just isn&#x27;t possible or doesn&#x27;t come around for a really long time, I don&#x27;t think this revolution will be too different from others. The more &quot;manual labor&quot; type thinking tasks (grading essays, evaluating legal reports, collecting and searching through information, etc) will be replaced by more and more sophisticated machines. What about creative tasks? That&#x27;s the final frontier as far as I&#x27;m concerned.<p>Well. It&#x27;ll almost certainly be really interesting.<p>One idea I&#x27;ve had (I think we all have a lot of crackpot ideas) for what people who aren&#x27;t suitable for highly skilled tasks are going to do revolves around social media and entertainment. What if a site like Reddit or Hacker News paid its users? I guess that&#x27;s ridiculous, I&#x27;m not sure how the economics would work out - our contributions here would have to become more valuable. But if fully integrated into our minds (aided by computers) maybe they would be? I&#x27;ve seen people tipped in bitcoins on Reddit before so maybe it&#x27;s possible. Just a crazy idea.",1424110664

I only offer advice, especially for young people which I mistakenly assumed, and I didn&#x27;t mean it arrogantly. I highly recommend reading one book: &quot;The Immense Journey&quot; by Loren Eiseley.<p>I completely agree that the problem of the lack of respect nor understanding of science is at an extreme, and it is an immense problem. You&#x27;re absolutely right.<p>But the way to attack it is systemically, from both sides. What we are experiencing is a societal divide, and it is not one sided, as unbalanced as it seems. It&#x27;s highly complex. Science has lost the ability to appeal to humanity in such a way as to be trustworthy in and of itself. For that, I do believe science as an institution (scientists, leaders, new institutions not yet imagined) requires a deep understanding of humanity and the ability to connect with it at a core level. This will be difficult.<p>There are some things for which evidence will never be enough. If you don&#x27;t understand that, well—there&#x27;s direct evidence for the disconnect between science and the humanities. When the scientific world collectively understands that, then, I believe, we will no longer have an issue with how society relates to science. It will have become clear and obvious.<p>Blaming the individuals for their knowledge will never solve anything. The right question is <i>not</i> what people do not know; but <i>why</i> do they not know? And how do we make it irresistible to know and understand and pursue science?

Nuclear engineering, like any field of industrial or weapons technology, has inherent dangers. That&#x27;s why both civilian and military engineering disciplines include safeguards.<p>On the civilian side, the profit-motivated nature of nuclear engineering has resulted in a variety of serious industrial accidents, which have produced a widespread but erroneous perception that the technology is just too dangerous to have, when in fact it&#x27;s merely too dangerous to have in the hands of people who care only about making money off it.<p>On the military side, conversely, the safeguards around nuclear weapons have, thus far at least, been exactly as effective as we need them to be, and nuclear warheads are as safe as anything can be that&#x27;s inherently dangerous. That&#x27;s not to say they are <i>perfectly</i> safe, but neither is anything else; all life is risk, and I&#x27;d much rather take the risk of having them, than of <i>not</i> having them and being at the mercy of someone who does.<p>(And military power reactors tend to be a lot safer than civilian ones as well, thanks to an engineering safety culture which I gather is best described as fanatical.

No man is going around dropping their pants hoping to be liked simply because it has never worked. That is to say if a man or woman touches another in a certain way, it is very likely that it is something that has worked in the past, and that continues to work for many.<p>I am just stating a fact here, and again apologies for offending anyone: you can go out nowadays meet people and sleep with them within hours of your very first interaction. I am not talking about a bar, I am talking about anywhere.<p>It goes further, many people who are in committed relationships (and I am not judging anyone) are openly flirtatious with co-workers.<p>The list goes on and on. So people see this, and follow accordingly.<p>When people see these things and do not stop to think is this right or wrong, they just follow suit.<p>In short men and women act this way because many other men and women allow it, and it works, and unfortunately those who do not like it end up being the offended.<p>Specifically to women: the mistake many make (at work) is to think they can act a certain with one person, and not expect other men to follow with their attempts.<p>My little advice is to behave in a way that tells everybody that this kind of behavior is not acceptable from the get go. Have your SAME limits set for everyone.<p>It is very sad that you have to do this, and unacceptable, but until both men and women understand what lines should not be crossed, you have to look out for yourself.",1424109902

Mostly, these are from men, and mostly they are in the form of &quot;Well, aren&#x27;t you a pretty young thing.&quot; Now, most of them (though by no means all) are, it seems, trying to be nice. She works in cardiology, so she sees an older population so this behavior is not exactly surprising.<p>Now, yes it may be a compliment, but it is an unwelcome one because it does two things. First, it puts her on the spot. How do you respond to that in an appropriate and professional manner? What if they are straight up inappropriate? [1]. What if they are addressing another person in the room and not you directly? (&quot;Wow doc, you have such pretty ladies taking care of me here!&quot;). This is an extremely uncomfortable position to be in, and one that most men never experience.<p>Second, this diminishes her professional qualities. With more or less clarity, lots of these men say things like &quot;you are so pretty, do you even know any medicine?&quot;. Some basically, say that straight up.<p>And the biggest problem with all this? These are incidental occurrences. If your boss pinches your bottom every day, you go to HR, complain and your boss gets to take sexual harassment training or gets fired. When patients make you uncomfortable, it&#x27;s always a question of whether it&#x27;s worth it to try to correct their behavior at the risk of being unprofessional. Remember, the patient can easily complain that you were rude to them. Make a habit of it, and like it or not but your job will be affected. This is especially bad since most of the people that make these comments don&#x27;t even realize that they are making her uncomfortable, so to call them out on it would be even more of a shock.<p>[1] One particularly bad incident was when she asked a patient about his sexual function and he responded with &quot;Well if you were my girlfriend, I wouldn&#x27;t have any issues, trust me.&quot;",1424109831

Besides, Apple doesn&#x27;t do their own manufacturing.<p>2. Again, this is also true of tons of other companies.<p>3. Reasonable, but no trendy company will admit the opposite.<p>4.

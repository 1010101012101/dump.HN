How can he learn from example?<p>As far as my photos being boring, not going to contest that. You just have to remember that, at this point, expediency is the main factor. I rigged up a system to pull selected files from my public Flickr account, which consist almost entirely of photos I do in my own time...which means there's a high proportion of wide lenses, as opposed to shots at 200mm...because I don't casually carry around the 200mm.<p>2) Also no contest...the technical details are trivial to include or exclude (once you've written a script that gathers photos from Flickr and reads the metadata). For now, I find them more useful than writing out as narrative, ""For this photo, I used my f2.8 lens wide open""...More can be done with the data design but I want readers to know at a glance what's going on before they read the caption of the photo. I'm hoping this leads to more <i>active</i> reading, because the reader has to ask himself ""This photo is shot at  f8.0 and yet the background is so blurred, how is that?""<p>> <i>I was looking at all the cool photos and I really wanted to know the f-stop, the exposure, the ISO that the author used. It took me about a year to figure out it didn't matter. Main reason being - you will never encounter that exact scene with that exact lighting.</i><p>I say that exact sentiment: don't worry about the numbers or the math. Maybe I didn't say it strong enough but I'm happy that someone on HN agrees and I'm not just dumbing down the math. I think memorization of numbers is silly.<p>What I want readers to be able to do is approach each photographic situation with a problem-solving mindset:<p>""This scene is dark. I want the photo to show my friend's face clearly, how do I balance the three settings and which flaw am I most willing to introduce into my photo to prevent other more critical flaws?""<p>3 and 4) Yep, no argument. And nowhere do I say, ""copy these numbers down""<p>5) <i>Now the most important point of learning how to photograph well: STOP READING TECHNICAL GARBAGE.</i><p>I agree, that's why I wrote this book in the first place. Obviously I haven't done it in the same way that you would but I don't think we disagree at all.",1340312054

Of course, there will be exceptions but there are many major players in this race who will work towards this objective. If you look at it in another way, it opens up a whole new world of opportunities not just for ICANN or the registry but for us, developers! Lets say I made a super awesome Iphone App and want a website for it, how much is the probability of me finding a relevant .com domain name for it? On the other hand, I have higher chances of getting a very relevant name with a .app extension & if this extension is popular amongst app users (which the .app registry would definitely ensure) then I have just multiplied chances of my app being discovered easily! Now some would argue that apps are to be found in app markets but then this was just a simple example, the possibilities are endless.

4144127,comment,4139232,4143810,1,0,JoshTriplett,,,"You seem to have responded to the first paragraph of my comment; the second paragraph answers your question.<p>I've argued that an inherent difference exists between copying something and taking the original.  Your analogy discusses taking the original, and I've already agreed that taking the original does not seem acceptable; applying that analogy to information produces a useful approach to handling trade secrets and personal/private information.<p>However, you've provided no reason or rationale to treat copying something the same as taking the original.  Your analogy does not cover that case, and your subsequent comments have not addressed it either.<p>Person A has a piece of data.  Person A lets person B copy that data.  What gives person C any particular right to complain?<p>Person A has a chair.  Person A lets person B construct a copy of that chair.  What gives person C any particular right to complain?<p>I view this as simple rent-seeking.<p>(The rest of this comment just responds to your specific complaint about ""artificial"", which seems like a side-track.  The point above represents the fundamental point of my series of comments.)<p>> Your answer seems to be that the latter opportunity is ""artificial"", but here ""artificial"" seems to be a synonym for ""pertaining to copyright"". If that's the best you can do, I stand pat on my M&M analogy.<p>I've made the assumption here that you don't mind having a discussion about rights that does not assume the current state of law as having any particularly inherent claim to optimality.  I don't want to privilege the hypothesis; I want to determine the optimal approach.  Assuming the current state of law puts the burden of proof on anyone arguing to change it.  Starting from nothing and arguing about what laws <i>should</i> exist puts the burden of proof on anyone wishing to construct a right where none inherently exists.  Hence my use of the word ""artificial"": I don't intend it as a synonym for ""pertaining to copyright""; I intended it as a label for a ""right"" that would have no particular reason to exist without the explicit construction of laws to enforce it.<p>I've also made the assumption here, based on your original analogy, that you already agree with the notion of property rights over physical property; I agree with that as well, so I've simply taken that as a given without exploring that issue further.  I hope you agree that we don't need to explore that.  You can either think of such rights as inherent, or think of them as artificial and assume that we agree on sufficient justification for them to exist.  Either way works for the purposes of this discussion.  I've stated this assumption explicitly to stave off any complaint you might have in response to my previous paragraph that ""property rights are artificial too by that definition"".<p>You also seem to believe that property rights extend to information, which I don't agree with, so <i>that</i> point I've explored quite extensively.  I don't consider those rights inherent; I consider them artificial, and I don't believe they have sufficient justification to exist.<p>I refuse to assume the burden of proof here.  You argue for copyright law, so you cannot assume copyright law when making your argument.  Please actually argue for it. :)",1340311906

For myself as a cis man, there are SO MANY more roles models that I see and hear about than many other group of people. It doesn't matter if you feel that you don't need role models because you grew up in a world where those kinds of people get the most amount of attention.<p>For women in tech it is completely different. Women in tech aren't visible. Sexist attitudes and news stories dominate the discussions about women in tech. Can you imagine how off putting that is to someone who likes tech? Would you want to spend your life working in a field where your very existence as a woman will be a constant source of harassment and experience erasure? That your skill will be questioned automatically because of your gender?<p>To suggest that such a site as Women and Tech is ""reverse sexist"" is ludicrous, because it is NOT sexist to provide safe spaces and outlets for people who are ignored and silenced in popular media (the web is the predominant popular media source for tech).",1340311901

4144120,comment,4142089,4142952,4,0,ericabiz,,,"""Do you have any advice for telling when someone is doing this?""<p>Yes.<p>Put simply, learn to read facial cues. (It's easier than you think--much like a programming language, facial cues are a system. So if you are a systems thinker--and I bet you are, based on the fact that you're here on Hacker News--learning facial and body cues will probably be one of the best time investments you'll ever make.)<p>I had no ingrained social skills when I grew up, so I had to learn facial cues to understand how to fit in socially. I can read nervousness on a face, and I can read the body posture and awkwardness that comes with not being sure of your ideas.<p>The first thing I did was to videotape myself speaking and focus on getting rid of those same cues in my own speech and posture. Then I started watching others. After a while, I could start to pick up all kinds of stuff. It's like a hidden language. I could tell when someone was lying or untrustworthy, when they were interested in what I was saying and when they had zoned out, etc. Incredibly useful!<p>So, to tell when someone is judging themselves too harshly, I look for two patterns:<p>1) Negative self-talk. ""I never could do this...I can't do this...I don't know how to do this...this is impossible...I guess I'm just not cut out for this..."" are some of the verbal patterns. Another common verbal pattern is looking for the negative in a given situation...""Yeah, I know C++, but not Javascript, and so I'm not the right fit"" vs. ""I'm a great programmer; I don't know Javascript yet, but I'm sure I can pick it up given some time and guidance."" (I made a concerted effort to get rid of my own negative self-talk and documented the result here: <a href=""http://www.erica.biz/2008/my-7-day-no-complaining-wrapup-or-how-to-acknowledge-yourself-101/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.erica.biz/2008/my-7-day-no-complaining-wrapup-or-...</a> )<p>2) Demeanor cues. Socially awkward, casting down glances toward the floor, not meeting eyes, mumbling. (Don't get too upset if you have some of these but you feel like you don't fit the description above...these can also describe other behaviors.)<p>Here is the book I used to learn more about this: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0757003141/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=ericadotbiz-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0757003141"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0757003141/ref=as_li_ss_tl?...</a> It was fantastic to read and finally feel relief that people's facial and body cues are a system that I can learn and understand.",1340311853

As an example (as used in the article), Facebook is one of the worst performing apps on my phone, often taking me to places I never touched and crashing occasionally. Therefore I would suggest that the hardware/implementation still needs to catch up first before choosing a blanket HTML5 architecture (which mind you the hardware is doing gradually).<p>Now, perhaps it because I am testing on older hardware; however this is for good reason. I test based on hardware that my clients/target audience use - if they upgrade and they get a speed increase then that's a bonus - but until then they need to get the best possible experience given the hardware they have.

I am Sean, co-founder of FeeFighters.<p>Integrating the acquisition of a small company into a large company is hard. I suspect there are very few acquisitions where customers do not experience at least some pain.  I am deeply sorry for customers who have had support tickets get dropped or experienced slow responses during this period of integration.  We are working to smooth things out.<p>When we got bought, in addition to some personal stuff, like moving across the country (most of our team moved to Palo Alto, so we could all be together instead of distributed), we had to very quickly build additional functionality and scalability into our product to support the ambitious goals that Groupon has for our technology.  Since we have been more focused on development and since Marc and Stella, who were doing a lot of our customer service, did not come along with the acquisition, our customer service has suffered.<p>It is really uncool how quickly other startups are to snipe at each other.  We started a business, pivoted, built something valuable, sold it at a profit, and are now in an amazing position to solve the customer problems we initially set out to solve. If that resulted in you having a bad customer experience, it is perfectly reasonable to complain about it, and we are listening and working to fix it.  But (Fred from Fleapay) why would you insult us by saying that we didn't build our product (we did)?  And what do you know about why Groupon bought us?

It is far more important to create product that is well-written, well-documented (I hate code without comments), easy to maintain and extend.<p>If you are doing embedded work that involves systems that could cause harm to people or property it is far more important that a programmer understand how to write safe code and take the time to make sure it is safe than to optimize editing speed.<p>Nothing I have seen in my career justifies contorting ones' brain to learn the commands of a modem-era text editor.  It's an utter waste of time when compared to optimizing what really matters.",1340310755

Odd choice using arduino, I guess for buzzwords?  Also it looks like they are using very little shielding.  We used several layers of shielding and a very thick hull- close to a centimeter, and each module in the device had a separate hull.  We also had a lot more sensors, including some pretty complex equipment (an electron spectrmeter, an auroral imager, a plasma probe...).<p>I really hope that commercializing space doesn't kill off the ridealong programs- I think there is a ton of potential in crowdsourcing this sort of thing.",1340309657

Ask for those kinds of examples. Ask what they're proud of. Create a space in which they feel comfortable saying positive things about themselves. Maybe lead by example by talking about part of the organization that you think is awesome.<p>Instead of asking ""what are you good at?"" you could ask for things like ""what do you most love doing?"" Also, asking for numeric ranking ""1-5"" of technical skills might be a little too aggro/macho.<p>Don't downplay the plural ""we built this"" as less important as the singular ""I built this""  Some people are just better at sharing the credit than others.

627859,comment,627728,627840,0,0,gchpaco,,,"Python as a language is so good that it becomes difficult to concisely describe why one wants metaprogramming.  Generally speaking the reason one wants metaprogramming is to make the language of the domain you are thinking in and the language of the program as close as possible.  So in banking we talk of accounts and transactions, not rows in a database.  The need for this is so acute in Java it makes my teeth ache.  Python is much more flexible; so much so that this becomes a difficult to explain urge, <i>but it is still there</i>.<p>An example may be worthwhile.  Consider SCons.  Know anybody who uses it?  There were a number of issues going on there (one of which was the general lameness of the Cons infrastructure--I'm sorry, I <i>use</i> the fact that make is a dependency computation engine, all the damned time, and ant and Cons and every other lame-ass ""make replacement"" that doesn't do this drives me up the wall) but IMHO the decision to make the syntax raw, executable Python code did not help.<p>Now, granted, I consider myself a Lisp hacker, so maybe you'll just write this off entirely.  But the key thing I have with Python, the key complaint I have, is that there are fundamental domain assumptions baked into the language that are sometimes appropriate (numpy is an enormous success, for example) and sometimes aren't (SCons, HTML template system du jour, configuration files, etc.), and I can't change them.<p>Edit: an example came to me as I thought about this.  So how's this as an explanation: in Java and Python, you can have as many nouns as you want.  You can have as many verbs as you like.  Adverbs are hard.  Pronouns are almost impossible.  And syntax?  Forget it.  It makes for an interesting contrast with mathematical notation, which takes time to learn and is inconsistent and only governed by social constraints but, at its best, is so good at communicating information that it fades into the background, just as = or 0 do.",1243389585
627858,comment,627728,627728,0,0,tsuraan,,,"The author makes the assertion that flat is better than nested, and indeed it's one of the rules in ""import this"", but I just don't see it.  I spend about half my time in python, and about half in erlang.  Erlang makes python look pretty deeply nested, since it pretty much lacks support for any namespace nesting, but honestly, I prefer Java's namespaces.  If I were to write a library in Java (god forbid), I'd start it in net.tsuraan.whatever.  I'd know that I'm not going to have namespace clashes with the standard library, apache, nor anybody else that is half-way sane.  In python, the root namespace is pretty crowded, and you need to step carefully to avoid namespace clashes.  In erlang, it's even harder.  Why do people like flat namespaces, as opposed to reasonably nested ones?",1243389582

My first thought since I had never used it, and the name makes no bones about it’s target language, was that this must just be some gimmick aimed at Java devs to make it comfortable for them to slide over to other languages.  The world already had one bloated, slow, Javaesque IDE that could do PHP…. Eclipse…. So why make another?<p>Curiosity got the better of me after hearing about some of the great stuff they were baking into the latest version.  So I downloaded the 6.7 M2 PHP version and have been using it exclusively for the last week.  Boy were my initial reactions dead wrong.  This thing absolutely rocks for PHP development.  It actually feels like and IDE built for PHP and not at all like PHP stuffed into a Java IDE (like Eclipse does).  Its fast and packed with features.  Some of the best features are not even the PHP ones.  The HTML, CSS, JS, and SVN support all seem top notch as well (something sometimes lacking in PHP focused IDEs).  The only sucky thing about it so far has been it’s name.  If any one is listening, please change the name to something that will not scare off non java-heads from trying this awesome IDE.<p>There is even a blog for the Netbeans for PHP.<p>I’ve used quite a large number of IDEs and editors over the years for my PHP hacking.  I’m not talking fired it up and made a bogus sample page, I’m talking using for months at a time to write real world projects.  Here is a quick rundown of some of my past PHP hacking tools of choice to give a perspective of where I’m coming from on this topic (these are in chronological):<p>* Textpad<p>I was n00b at one point :)<p>* Vim<p>Just too lacking in features for my taste, but still use for server side hacking and locally for quickly popping open a file.  Though I usually use MacVim these days.<p>* Dreamweaver<p>When I was still a bit wet behind the ears and not as hard core on the server side this helped to make me more productive with client side coding and was sufficient for my server side needs (especially since I was also doing ColdFusion work at that time).<p>* PHPEdit<p>Back when this was free and I needed something more robust than Dreamweaver for PHP coding this fit the bill quite nice.<p>* Eclipse<p>Yes, I have actually used this quite a bit.  At one point I was juggling lots of projects in lots of different languages at the same (PHP, ColdFusion, Python, bash, MySQL, XML, …) and wanted a way to streamline my workflow.  Eclipse got the job done.  It felt totally half baked and was full of bizarre Java language and concepts, but I was able find pluggins for everything I wanted it to do and it worked pretty well.<p>* Zend Studio <= 5 (before it sucked ass)<p>Once I was able to focus on strictly a LAMP environment I started looking for something more suitable.  I ran across Zend Studio and the wonders of server side debugging in PHP and I was hooked.  I used this IDE for almost 3 years and loved it (it’s non PHP support was a bit weak but…)<p>* Zend Studio 6 (when it sucked ass)<p>With version 6 of Zend Studio that decided to turn it into Zend Studio for Eclipse.  I’ve never seen such a colossal step backwards for a piece of software (with the possible exception of Windows Vista).  It didn’t support half the features it had in previous versions.  The old studios was fairly lean, but the new one came with all the Eclipse bloat and could barely get off the ground with the main project I was working on at the time.  Even though I could sluggishly code… I could not use the debugger without the thing crashing.  The love affair with Zend Studio was over and was time to move on.<p>* Komodo<p>I really like Komodo.  It was my ZendStudio rebound, and is more or less still my IDE of choice until I burn NetBeans in a little more.  I appreciate its support for multiple languages (use it for Python/Django on the Smoron project) and the javascript debugger.  Not exactly sure how I put this… its good and functional but doesn’t exactly have a huge WOW factor.<p>* NetBeans<p>Not sure if it is because its the “new” thing for me, or if it is because it is really that good.  But I’m currently WOWed :)",1243389443

627841,comment,627666,627666,0,0,sho,,,"The article espouses a nice theory, but I can think of some pretty big holes, especially relating to differing cultures and indeed our own historical experience. Musicians were not always the revered gods they are today. Back in 16th century England, I can't imagine the neighbourhood bard being more of a chick-puller than, say, the rich merchant.<p>Culture plays a huge part too. I was speaking to one of my Chinese friends the other day and was struck by something she said about the popular boys in her school. I asked what made the boys popular - she replied that, amongst other desirable traits, they got good grades. Needless to say this does not apply in any western society I've been a member of. Rather the opposite, in fact.<p>In a society edging towards post-scarcity, perhaps the desirability of conspicuous displays of wasted energy, like being ""cool"" or whatever, move to the fore. But in a society still climbing the developmental ladder, I just don't see it. Not to say that the theory lacks any merit at all - the conspicuous waste thing could well be a big factor, like how people buy ridiculously expensive watches just to show they can. But I don't see how it ""evolved"" when even the west has been like this for only half a century or so.<p>A more likely explanation for the sexual allure of popular musicians is their perceived wealth, exciting and interesting lives, boasting rights over ones' friends, and over society in general. The same thing can be seen, mapped into a different context, in the Chinese experience - good grades at school = good university = good job = all of the above benefits. I would posit this is a more likely explanation than the ""evolved waste"" theory.",1243388565

Avoiding sample bias is a hard problem, far harder than most people appreciate.<p>To complicate matters further, ""accuracy"" is an extremely tricky concept in statistical analysis because error rates work very differently than they do in, say, physics.  In physics, when you measure something you can be sure that your results are accurate, so long as you stay outside your instrument's range of error.  In stats, your confidence interval just tells you how likely it is that your results are <i>completely wrong</i>, or even worse, wrong by a completely unknown amount.  Every statistical inference you make has a chance of completely blowing up on you.  That chance can be defined and reduced, but it can never be eliminated.

Now that Atlanta (where I live) has WiMAX from Clear, I ought to be connected everywhere within the city to the internet (once I sign up). Theoretically, this should mean that I will be able to use my netbook as a cell phone. Of course, there are some very real issues to overcome and I am simply putting this experiment together to see if it is something that is realistically possible. This could possibly extend to uncapped 3G connections (if they exist anymore) as well. Are there any obvious problems you would foresee? Is there anything I have missed or any other questions I should attempt to answer in this 'experiment' of mine? A major issue is, of course, the fact that my pseudo-netbook has to be carried everywhere and left always on. If the experment is somewhat succesful, it seems as if using your netbook/MID as a phone might require a relatively customized OS which could possibly be a 'remix' of a suitable Linux distro. Something like Maemo, but not as hardware specific. Thoughts, suggestions?""",1243386532

Your flow is interrupted every time you have to authorize a 5 cent charge to view a piece of content. This doesn't work, never will.<p>Contenture's system is fully automated. You pay a small monthly fee of 5.99 (which the sites get 80% of), and we automatically distribute that money to the sites you visit based on how often you visit them. While there are drawbacks to this sytem, certainly, we feel the advantage of a fully automated system vastly outweights any of that.",1243386463

The tracking code that you copy/paste also contains inline javascript directly on the site that detects if the tracking code has been blocked, so sites can program in logic for that as well.<p>We really do think worrying about these users is a waste of your time though. Just like blocking ads, if you want to try to get something for nothing, you can.<p>Lastly, sites don't even have to enable any of the premium features. They are optional. Contenture is as much about users supporting sites that they enjoy as it is about enabling premium features on your site. Because everyone knows ads don't even pay the hosting bill. If you don't want to pay - that's your decision.",1243386341

Found myself with a lot of free time recently (same ol story).  Took this opportunity to work on an idea that I had to aggregate opinions and generate top ten lists.  But rather than outsource, took it upon myself to learn how to code (cuz I always wanted to know how).<p>Would love to get feedback from the HN community.  Curious to hear whether or not folks feel qrisper provides a useful service.  Tips/comments/suggestions would be greatly appreciated.<p>Jung

627804,comment,627722,627722,0,0,ratsbane,,,"My usual development environment for is a Macbook Pro with six terminal windows open.  The first one (Command-1 shortcut key) is a connection to the database, the second (command-2) is Vim with program code, the third (command-3) is library code or test scripts or whatever and the next three (smaller, with blue backgrounds) might be showing tail -f of Apache error or access logs or something like that.  If I need to edit an image I command-tab to the GIMP, to view a web page, command-tab to Firefox or whatever.  I can connect those windows to one or more remote boxes with ssh and not even have to think about what machine I'm working on.  It's easy to reuse those windows for other things, close one with command-w or open new ones with command-n.  Vim does syntax highlighting and will even auto-complete if I wanted to turn it on.<p>What would an IDE give me that this setup won't?  To me, the setup I use IS an integrated development environment.<p>I have used Visual Studio, XCode, Eclipse, etc. but whenever I do I feel slow and inhibited because of the necessity of mouse movements (unless I want to learn a completely different set of key shortcuts that will only work in the IDE and not the OS) and the annoying tendency of IDEs to reformat my code or complete blocks I'm not ready to complete.<p>Also, OS X and Ubuntu both allow great control over terminal window transparencies and color schemes.  I'm not aware of any other IDE that does.  I like to keep my main editing windows at 70-80% transparent so I can watch logfiles/test scripts run in the background while I'm editing.",1243386109

Aspartame is a carcinogen, as are most other artificial sweeteners...even Splenda contains chlorine.  Aspartame also gives me migraines, so I generally stick with cane sugar or honey.  Stevia, xylitol, and erythyritol have many positives, but they're pricey and often have a bad aftertaste and/or laxative effect.  I'm addicted to sweet tea, but I'm trying to reduce my sugar consumption.  White and green tea and fruit spritzers are the only alternatives I've found that work for me...black tea just makes me crave sugar.",1243386034

8938483,comment,8938088,8938088,0,0,dcpdx,,,"The company I work for recently won a contest put on by Lyft offering free Lyft Line rides to and from work for an entire week.  I live in Lower Pac Heights and work in the Financial District and take a couple different Muni routes to and from work.  I&#x27;ll take either the 2 or the 3 heading in and the 38L heading back; the 38L is way too crowded in the morning by the time it gets to my closest stop.  Morning commute usually takes around 15 minutes and afternoon takes around 10.<p>So, my commute isn&#x27;t bad by any means but I decided to give Lyft Line a shot to see if I could do any better.  The first day I tried hailing one in the morning, the app hung up looking for drivers; it said 1 minute to match with a driver but I waited 3 before quitting the app and deciding to take Muni.  That afternoon, I tried again but ran into the same issue.  The next afternoon, I was finally able to line up a ride but had to wait 10 minutes for the driver to get to me.  Once he did and we were on our way, I had the joyful experience of sitting in traffic for blocks on end while watching Munis zip by in the designated lanes beside us.  Not including wait time, the ride took around 20 minutes (double my normal commute time).<p>I&#x27;m sure there are some routes for which Line is a better option than public transportation, but I personally have a much better experience on Muni than I did with Line.  I get why they&#x27;re focused on rush hour; a service like Line requires a critical mass of people to use the app concurrently in order to make it work.  But, the downside of this is that the times when it reaches this point are the times when traffic is the worst and public transportation offers a superior alternative in many cases.  We&#x27;ll see if this ends up taking off, but I know I won&#x27;t be using it for my commute.  Maybe this would be better suited for one-off events like Outside Lands, Giants games etc. but I&#x27;d imagine they&#x27;d run into the same problems.",1422063976

I have spent almost 100% of my career both as an employee and employer on the east coast, with a small stint in the mid-west.<p>I would say your general characterization of east coast employers is fairly accurate, although I am not sure if it differs from west coast employers.  But on the East Coast it appears they really frown on side projects and most will even try and make you sign agreements stating anything you invent, code or otherwise work on  whether on their time or yours is their intellectual property.  I have seen so many of these it blows my mind.  East Coast businesses seem to think they own you more than it at least appears happens on the West Coast, but again, I may be wrong.   A friend had me look at some paperwork (NDA etc) a startup here on the East Coast gave him as part of his offer letter.  When I read it I was alarmed it basically said they would own anything he did that involved software development, even if he had priorly invented it, including that he would have to assign prior related or new patents to them.  I am not even sure that is actually enforceable but I told him I would never sign that.<p>As for your experience and reference questions, relating to Software positions specifically.  I personally do not call any references, I judge people based on how I  feel when talking with them.  Plus I feel that most times reference calls are liability focused where you get standard answers to standard questions and nothing more.  I have had less than a ten calls to me for reference checks in the past 4-5 years on employees that have left, which I have had far more than ten on my teams leave.  So I don&#x27;t think a lot of people call them either.<p>I also don&#x27;t care if I see references on a resume, in fact, I kind of prefer not to see them.  If it is important I will ask you.<p>When you say that you have been let go after people find out you have a side project.  I honestly haven&#x27;t seen that, unless the side project is interfering with your daily work, or has some conflict.<p>That said, I will say as an employer I was recently burned by a few employees each having their own side project that they were working.  I found they were really quite distracted and I knew their output was very good previously to their side projects. I saw the degradation in their abilities, performance and they were just not delivering even though they felt and would argue they were still giving me 100%.  I can&#x27;t say they weren&#x27;t giving me 100% but the 100% they were giving me was 60% because they were over tired and distracted. They were constantly thinking about their own project more than the one I was paying them for, and it became more and more obvious as time went on.  So none of them are with me today.  So maybe your impression and your previous employers differs, if you are friendly with anyone still there maybe ask for some honest opinions from co-workers.",1422063123

Therefore, there&#x27;s no implication that abolishing Economic Rights like restricting others from copying must also abolish attribution rights</i><p>You&#x27;re correct that moral and property rights are distinct in many civil law countries, but both are under the umbrella of copyright and, as far as I know, there are no countries that enforce moral rights but not property rights.  I&#x27;m aware that there are countries that do the reverse: acknowledge property rights but not moral rights.

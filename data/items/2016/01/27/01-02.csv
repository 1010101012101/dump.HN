The real reason to do a program like this is probably still the advise and the connections with potential early stage investors in case you do decide to keep the company running for longer than a quarter (and you are not the rare company that can be profitable in a few months). Essentially, if you don&#x27;t need much money right this moment but already know you want to go the traditional VC-funded company route and want access to that sort of environment and business/legal/etc advise, this program is lightweight/flexible way to do that.<p>Also, I don&#x27;t know if there are any geographic restrictions to this program, but 20K could keep a 3-4 people company alive for a year or more in many parts of the world.

An Erlang program consists of (possibly) thousands of individual lightweight-processes. In this model a typical task may be spread out over many asynchronous processes. You can think of it as a program thats made up of thousands of micro-services. Instead of a task taking place over a sequential piece of code, it takes places over many individual processes that coordinate by communicating with each other.",1453859465

It&#x27;s not that difficult, because the reasons for messages being sent are predictable.<p>You get a lot of emergent behavior in systems with mutable state that is avoided in systems that enforce immutable state, and without that it becomes far more tractable to trace back a series of events and reason about them. You got a message? Okay, who can send that message? If it&#x27;s more than one, is there a reason why you aren&#x27;t indicating -who- sent that message (in Erlang, including a pid as part of the message; this is done automatically any time you use a gen_server and send a synchronous message via call)? But regardless, what does that message mean? Is it the same across all senders? Because if so, your bug is in the implementation in this actor. If not, if the message means different things when sent from different places, you need to figure out what the different messages you want to send are, and send different messages for them.<p>If you have mutable code, even mutable message passing, the time the message arrived changes what it does. Suddenly you have situations where the message being sent, and the behavior the actor exhibits, is dependent on mutable state. It&#x27;s totally correct in some instances, and totally incorrect in others; completely dependent on what has happened in the system previously as to whether ~this~ particular message, with the coded behavior, does the right thing or not. And it&#x27;s that, the interplay of all events that came before, that makes things complex.",1453859416

Quite simply, the web was not designed to be used the way we’re using it, and evolving standards have made browser rendering engines horrifically complex (and in some cases convoluted).<p>What’s needed is a fundamental reimagining of HTML, CSS, and the DOM at minimum with little to no regard for legacy. In the 90s, we didn’t know what we needed but now the picture is crystal clear. Should we use this knowledge to design a new web, I’m positive that the result would be just as open as the web is now while performing tens or hundreds of times better — it’d likely be good enough to make web apps competitive with native apps under a far wider set of circumstances.",1453859406

Practically every programming language has libraries to parse and generate them.<p>One of the interesting things about Erlang is it has binary pattern matching. Matching any binary in it is just as trivial or even more trivial than parsing json in other langauges.<p>Here is what an IP packet parsing might look like:<p><pre><code>    <<4:4, HeaderLength:4, _DiffServ:8, _Length:16, _Identification:16,\n      _Flags:3, _FragOffset:13, _TTL:8, Protocol:8, _HeaderChecksum:16,\n      SrcAddr:32/bits, DstAddr:32/bits, OptionsAndData/bytes>>\n</code></pre>\nIt looks almost like casting a binary blob to a C struct, but you can do even crazier things like take Length and match it later in the pattern, if it specifies a length prefixed binary, for example.<p>> the difference in data usage would scarcely be measurable<p>It depends. See, Joe&#x27;s background is from Ericsson. Their stuff controls access of 50% of world&#x27;s smartphone <-> internet traffic. When people say &quot;but who uses functional languages in the industry?&quot; the answer is if functional languages won&#x27;t work, chances are high, you won&#x27;t see picture of cats on your smartphone.<p>But the idea is that mobile bandwith is still a precious resourse. Even if our CPU and hard drives are getting bigger. That is one shared resource that is expensive. Maybe if a 1M clients use JSON vs a binary protocol doesn&#x27;t make a difference much for some startup, when we talk about billions of connected devices talking over radio waves, those things add up. Well, also, game servers use UDP and binary often because of latency.

10977617,comment,10973956,10975696,0,0,Symmetry,,,"I feel a rant on software patents coming on.<p>I&#x27;ve been in groups that have been on the receiving end of patent lawsuits twice.  Both times the patents were transparently invalid.<p>The first time involves my dorm at MIT.  Back before I arrived there some enterprising student had hooked up our laundry machines to the internet so we could all find out when there was a free one and when our laundry was done.  The internet at large got wind of this and sadly the servers were Slashdotted in both senses of the word.  Shortly after the idea appeared on Slashdot some enterprising entrepreneur filed for a patent on the idea of hooking laundry machines up to the internet and was granted it.  Several years later our dorm, through MIT, was sued for patent infringement.  Luckily the MIT administration had spines so they didn&#x27;t get anywhere.  But the patent is still in force and other universities still have to pay millions of dollars to this group to hook their laundry machines up to the internet.<p>The second time involved the first company I worked for out of grad school, a sensors consultancy.  They had some ideas about structural health monitoring using piezoelectrics and sent their designs off to another company to be fabbed.  They filed for patents on their ideas and shortly after the fab house filed for patents on those same ideas.  They mostly got their patents but for some reason the fab house got one in first despite filing later causing their patent application to be denied.  Then the fab house sued them and somewhere in the process there were layoffs and I lost my job.<p>Just because something is patented doesn&#x27;t mean that it is original and non-obvious.  The Patent Office doesn&#x27;t actually have enough resources to do the job that has been set out for it.  The number of patent applications being submitted has increased exponentially over the years but the USPO staff hasn&#x27;t.  You might ask why they just don&#x27;t fail to grant a patent until they&#x27;ve examined it carefully.  Well, they used to do that but the backlog got big and Congress In Its Wisdom passed a law saying that they couldn&#x27;t have a backlog.  You might ask why they don&#x27;t raise filing fees and use the money to hire more workers.  Well, Congress In Its Wisdom has decided what the fees are and has also decided that the USPO can&#x27;t keep all the money it collects since there are needy people in many other Congressional districts.  So that&#x27;s where we are.<p>It would not surprise me in the least if many NVidia and AMD patents cover the same ideas in different language.  But just because AMD happens to have a patent on the technique they&#x27;re using doesn&#x27;t mean that NVidia can&#x27;t sue them with their own patent on that same technique.  Legally patents have a presumption validity behind them so courts are bound to assume the USPO gave them the sort of inspection the USPO is unable except in certain complicated cases.",1453858352

Those make good programmer, not minutiae about creating identifiers.<p>Lot of this will happen during accretion. You can rationalize adding one low level method to a high level class because at the time because you only have one request to do.<p>On the other hand, had you a request that warranted a whole bunch of low level stuff in your high level program, it&#x27;s very easy to see the opportunity of separating those concerns.<p>If you have good instincts for your problem space, chances are you&#x27;ll foresee a lot of these needs. You might even have the concerns separated long before the requests for them come in. Instincts take time to develop. So most people end up writing sub-optimal code because it&#x27;s the cost of training someone. Code reviews stop it from actually getting committed, but the team is still incurring a cost with the small chance it doesn&#x27;t pay off from the person not adapting the reviewer&#x27;s style.<p>How often do you sit and count the number of purposes a class has? The number of dependencies you&#x27;re adding per unit time? The amount of small things that sneak in because it&#x27;s just one small change and we really want to go drinking tonight? Do you go through this ritual every time you open the source? After all, you don&#x27;t just have to worry about your code, but also your co-workers&#x27;. Are they putting in the same effort as you are?<p>Even if you do that, what are your thresholds? Can you defend for choosing a particular value? Maybe it&#x27;s just inherited from someone who has a bigger name than you, which is a good guideline, but is not necessarily law.<p>To me, it will always come down to finding like-minded people in this area, which means there are people that just don&#x27;t care about the quality as long as it works. It&#x27;s a people problem. Since the compiler/interpreter is happy to run terrible looking code, maybe it should have hard coded thresholds as compiler warnings decided by dice rolls!",1453857203

10977511,comment,10976714,10976714,0,0,jrockway,,,"I don&#x27;t think the MTA is aiming for optimal scheduling.  Peak demand depends on two things: the number of trainsets available, and the track capacity.  I recently read their in-depth analysis of the A/C lines.  A/C capacity is strictly limited by the interlocking between Hoyt-Schermerhorn and Jay St - Metrotech.  It can handle 28 trains per hour if everything runs perfectly, and they have approximately that many scheduled.  Similarly, people complain about the C being 8 cars instead of 10 (actually 480&#x27; vs. 600&#x27;).  Unfortunately, the MTA doesn&#x27;t own enough railcars to be able to run the C with 10 cars.<p>Off-peak service is a disaster and the only thing that explains their scheduling is that they can&#x27;t afford to pay the conductors and train operators.  Their guidelines are definitely shaped by &quot;how can we keep the system running with the atrociously-limited amount of money we get from the state&quot;, rather than &quot;there&#x27;s no possible way to run 28 trains per hour 24/7&quot;.<p>Waiting 20 minutes for a train is still better than systems that shut down at 11pm and reopen at 6am, though.<p>Edit: here&#x27;s the analysis that explains all of this better than I can: <a href=""http://web.mta.info/nyct/service/pdf/AC_LineReview.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.mta.info/nyct/service/pdf/AC_LineReview.pdf</a><p>Great document.",1453856631

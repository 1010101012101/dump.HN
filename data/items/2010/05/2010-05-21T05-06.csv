1366503,comment,1366217,1366217,0,0,dbz,,,"I hope this comment is taken the right way. I don't want to boast, but I have to say some things which will sound like bragging (even though it isn't) in order explain my 'ness' =]. Furthermore, a lot of what I say may be controversial to some and won't be appreciated. Also, I can't recommend you do anything I do, because even though it works for me, it will most likely have unintended consequences for you.<p>I use my street smarts every day. I may say the same thing to ten people ten different ways- not because I want to `change things up,` but because I analyze and judge everyone  I meet upon every occasion I have. It also helps that my verbal IQ is off the charts (and therefore placed in the 99.99th percentile). This allows me to articulate and find words that accurately represent the people I meet, and understand them more. (Please note I am dyslexic and have processing difficulties which mean how I write is not representative of my verbal IQ because I can't process fast enough while writing to say coherently what I think like I can when I am talking. <- example there)<p>(1) Analyze every person and remember it<p>The importance of what I am doing is used when I get in a sticky situation. <i>There are two types of people, those who give excuses, and those who solve problems</i>. I use what I learn and assume(#1) about people to describe to them in the most effective way possible what needs to be done. When I present ideas to people, I don't present ideas- <i>I present the problem and why the idea solves it</i>.
(#1 cont.   Don't tell a person what you assume about his or her character- not only is it unbecoming, it will probably piss him or her off unless it is a special circumstance)<p>(2) Become the person who is (known for) immediately <i>solving</i> problems<p>I, unfortunately, break a commandment more than I should. I lie. When I lie, I don't think that the most important thing is not to get caught. I think about how the lie is helpful, and how I am going to expose the lie later ESPECIALLY if the person knows I am lying. For example, I had a tutor who was approaching a subject I could not talk about for a reason I will not explain. This is the kind of guy who will not accept an ""excuse"" for not talking about a subject regardless of the validity. In this circumstance, talking about the subject (it was personal) would be detrimental to our working relationship and the time would be better spent working on something else..So I lied. I did not lie elaborately, but I lied in a fashion where I knew he would believe me. Three hours after he left, I wrote him an email apologizing for my lie, explaining why I did it and the benefits it had. He was not upset about it, but understanding and appreciated the honesty, ironic huh?<p>(3) Choose your words carefully<p>Nothing is free. When you accept something from a friend, even if it is explicitly spoken that no strings are attached, you owe them. Of course this may actually be the kind of person where he or she truly believes that you do not owe them anything, but expect it. <i>When you deliver a favor, unless explicitly stated and agreed upon, the person receiving the favor owes you nothing</i>, so don't ask for anything in return. I know, I am saying ""<i>Be the person you do not expect anyone else to be</i>"". However, if you want to enter show biz and need connections and will have to rely on people to make your way to the top, make damn sure you can rely on who you are relying on.<p>(4) <i>Low expectations cost you nothing, but let you reap the benefits of positive events</i><p>Unfortunately, a lot of the <i>rules</i> I live by don't allow me to be an open person. I don't like to talk about myself, ect. Today, I had a very in-depth conversation with a friend who I consider to be one of my closed friends. She is one of my closed friends because I know if were in another state- and I needed a way to get somewhere else, she would drop everything and drive cross country to help me. I talked to her today about some of my problems and I brought her to tears. She explained how she feels like she didn't know me very well and how she feels like she has failed as a friend because she didn't know me better, and she wished that she could have ""watched movies and ate ice creme with"" me during all the times I have had trouble because of depression or my pet dying ect. because that's what she would have done. I had to explain to her that it wasn't her fault but mine for being the kind of person who isn't sharing. At the moment, lots of bad things are happening to me even though I don't deserve them (I'm not going to talk to everyone about them, but I talked to her about them), and she got very angry, and didn't understand why I am so forgiving to others. Why don't I hold grudges? Why did I forgive her for being a ""bad"" friend? Why am I understanding when I <i>shouldn't</i> be? Why don't I just accept (things)? I responded with,<p>(5 part 1) <i>Forgive and Forget(However, learn the lessons of the situation.), Cut your losses, Make your next plan, and execute.</i>
[I'm clearly an introvert]
(5 part 2) <i>Most heroes fail before they become successful</i><p>Most of what I have said applies to my weird social situations. One last piece of advice which is on my mind- I have purposefully saved for last. When you are in egypt, please don't accept a tour of the mountains in the valley of the kings from a kind local (long story). Again, when you are above under-ground tombs and locals want to give you a tour. Please don't take it (long story). Furthermore, if you are going to take it, PLEASE walk behind them. (Again long story).<p>(6) <i>Just because you can, doesn't mean you should</i>
-
Well, that is all I can think of off the top of my head. This is unedited and probably contains errors. I can also see you saying I am FOS. But you need to realize, <i>We all live in our own world</i>. I'd appreciate anything anyone has to say to me- especially if you think I am FOS, but please- respond tactfully.",1274420927

Whether it is conflict resolution or negotiations, you open up possibilities when you look at things in someone else's shoes. This also works great in problem solving. When I get stuck on a problem, I think about how a person admire might tackle the problem.",1274418547

It's quite probable that the worn passport, plus the fact he was caught hacking that would have sent up a red flag when he came through, not so much the wikileaks stuff, or a combination of all the things he's done, not the wikileaks stuff by itself. Mind you, Australia does have a history of arresting those who ""leak"" protected reports [1], but then he would have been arrested, not just had his passport confiscated!<p>But it's easy to speculate!<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.caslon.com.au/whistlecasesnote4.htm#kessing"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.caslon.com.au/whistlecasesnote4.htm#kessing</a>",1274418499

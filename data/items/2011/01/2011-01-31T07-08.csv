2160683,comment,2158966,2159524,0,0,PakG1,,,">> * Does the type of job matter? For instance, I would imagine that it might be a lot more difficult to build a remote team of investment bankers than it might be to build a remote team of programmers.<p>>> * Are certain phases of a job easier to handle remotely? For instance, perhaps coming up with an architecture needs to be collocated but the actual process of coding might be more productive if handled remotely. Or perhaps writing a research paper can be handled remotely, but editing it needs to be collocated.<p>Nitpicking, but I think the 3rd question is invalidating the way the 2nd is phrased.  Comparing investment bankers and programmers is difficult to put as apples to apples.  Easier to compare investment bankers to architects or analysts to programmers at a detailed level (although admittedly many investment bankers would be their own analysts, just as many programmers would be their own architects).  Perhaps the 2nd question would be better phrased as ""Does the type of industry matter"", rather than ""Does the type of job matter"".<p>Here's one anecdote of where it's easy enough for financial guys to have analyst work done by non-colocated people, and still achieve success:

The main reason being while the EFF's sample is specific to violations recognized and reported as such, the Inspector General's report is specific to NSLs and <i>not</i> specific to things initially recognized as violations. The later report cites such comparatively minor violations as typos which are likely to be under-represented in the IOB documents, where more serious (and obvious) violations likely over-represented.<p>That is to say: there may be several thousand additional violations, but the proportion of them which are of the (arguably) more benign classes of clerical mistakes and ""overproduction"" may be much higher than in the EFF's sample. I think that 20% is very unlikely to be reflective of the (unknown) whole and I think the findings in the Inspector General's report[1] support that.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.justice.gov/oig/special/s0803b/final.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.justice.gov/oig/special/s0803b/final.pdf</a>",1296459611

Do you really need the D in DVCS if you're not really distributed?<p>But to address your question: my experience moving from Subversion to a DVCS for an organization that's sizable enough to be similar is that Mercurial provides a much shorter path to being basically operational, but that's not saying much.<p>I don't think the web has decided that Git is the clear winner.  You're probably onto something about your engineering team, though.  In an org of that size, it's quite likely that the complexity of DVCS will be out o grasp of quite a number of them, so you should definitely be sure that the switch won't totally undermine your operation.  Also consider the training.  Even if hg syntax is similar svn, it's a fundamentally different thing.  If you're really using DVCS for all it's worth, you're probably not going to be on premises with every engineer to facilitate training, so you'll either be flying all over to help them or they're going to need to be able to do it themselves.<p>If you're not absolutely committed, don't move.  If you are committed to switch, you can piggyback on Subversion knowledge to get to an okay place with Mercurial.  Git certainly won't make it simpler, but it almost doesn't even matter, so if you prefer it and you're leading, you might as well go with your preference.",1296459601

2160651,comment,2160428,2160428,0,0,cletus,,,"Firstly, the title is a misnomer. There's nothing here about <i>how</i> to disrupt Wall Street. It's all <i>what</i> needs to be done without knowing how.<p>Some thoughts:<p>Investing banking is an interesting case. On something like an IPO I see IBs as providing three benefits:<p>1. Navigating the significant regulatory hurdles;<p>2. Underwriting the offering; and<p>3. Marketing the offering.<p>(2) and (3) are related. (3) relies on them having clients with the money to invest in the IPO.<p>This isn't a simple issue of finding money. Part of a successful IPO is seeding the stock such that trading on the relevant market(s) is liquid.<p>Not that I'm saying disruption isn't possible but it is hard.<p>Investing in the stock market <i>directly</i> is, for most people, a sucker's game. The stock market is an insider's market. HFT is just one of many ways that the pros will take advantage of you.<p>Note: I quite deliberately differentiated between <i>trading</i> (short term) and <i>investing</i> long term. Long term investing reduces the significance of timing and transaction fees but individually picking stocks is still a risky business.<p>As for prop trading, for completeness I should point out that it is one model for market makers to trade for profit, paying for what is actually a valuable service. Market makers are commonly daemonized, unfairly IMHO. Market makers give you the liquidity to buy and sell whenever you want.<p>The other trading method is spread trading, basically making money off the bid-ask spread. The spread is basically inversely proportional to the size of the market. In smaller European markets, spread trading is still profitable. In the US government market (basically US Treasuries, possibly the largest market in the world) the spread is essentially zero so the only way to make money is prop trading. Prop trading means taking a position, betting on a particular outcome.<p>Arbitrage is another model but computerized trading system has greatly reduced the effectiveness of this. Arbitrage is buying some security on one market and simultaneously selling it on another for a higher price, pocketing the difference (eg buy gold in NY, sell it in HK).<p>As for mutual funds, they have been disrupted by ETFs (exchange traded funds), which greatly increase the liquidity of such investments and decrease transaction costs. Funds also like them because fund redemptions are a huge problem. Typically people take out and put in money at the wrong times. ETFs mean investors can get money out by simply selling them on the stockmarket.<p>Still, fund managers do make management fees.<p>Financial products are constantly changing. It's an area that, by its nature, must and does constantly innovate. For example, 10 years ago there was no way for retail investors to short stocks. Now? Most markets have CFDs (contracts for difference) that are a derivative that allows you to go long or short on a stock for a low amount of capital.<p>Research is an interesting one. Good analysis is a skill and requires access, something a name brand bank provides. That being said, it is an area rife with conflict of interest and late signals.<p>Retail banks have of course been somewhat disrupted by their online cousins.<p>Wall Street is constantly changing. It's an arms race where one side trades faster so all the other players do as well. Unfortunately, Wall Street enjoys significant government protection, much to our detriment (eg financial crises brought about, at least in part, by Wall Street having little to no aversion to risk, IMHO due to the almost guarantee of a bailout by the Fed if it goes south).<p>The most important area of the finance industry is retirement savings and here the US is extremely backward. Companies allowed to invest pensions in themselves, one part of a bank dragging down everything else with it and so on.<p>In Australia, for example, most people have individual superannuation accounts for retirement savings. There are very strict rules on what these funds can invest in. Such funds are separated from (and insulated against) whatever else happens to the financial institution. The funds are held in trust by third parties.",1296459229

Along with you, we are not pleased with this, and our view is more fully expressed in our press release which you can find here: http://www.teksavvynews.com/<p>From March 1 on, users of the up to 5 Mbps packages in Ontario can expect a usage cap of 25GB (60GB in Quebec), substantially down from the 200GB or unlimited deals TekSavvy was able to offer before the CRTC's decision to impose usage based billing.  Users who were on unlimited package rates will be returned to $31.95 capped rates although larger blocks of bandwidth can be purchased.*<p>In order to facilitate this transition we have constructed a new easy-to-navigate portal at https://myworld.teksavvy.com where our customers can choose from the amended and new packages.
The details of our new rate plans and charges can be found there. You will be able to register using the account information found at the end of this email.  More on the portal below.  In addition, in order to accommodate these changes, we have amended our Terms of Service, primarily regarding implementation. The amended Terms form part of your Agreement with TekSavvy and can be viewed at https://secure.teksavvy.com/en/termspolicies.asp.<p>Please note if you do not choose a new service before March 1, 2011, your existing package will be transitioned into an amended package. Existing packages and the ones they will be replaced with in each case can be found at http://teksavvy.com/en/faq-ubb_on.asp for Ontario and http://teksavvy.com/en/faq-ubb_qc.asp for Quebec.<p>Content and data like Netflix, YouTube, IPTV, large file downloads or other streaming services can consume large amounts of bandwidth and place your cap limits in jeopardy very quickly.  We encourage you to monitor your usage carefully, as the CRTC has imposed a very high overage rate, above your new monthly limit, of $1.90 per gigabyte ($2.35 per gigabyte in Quebec).<p>The CRTC did however provide an option for insurance usage blocks at $4.75 per 40GB block per month, which can be purchased if you want to reduce your cost for use above 25GB (60GB in Quebec).<p>Ontario and Quebec up to 5 Mbps users with a monthly limit of 25GB and 60GB respectively:<p>Insurance Blocks Offered:<p><pre><code>   * $4.75 - 40GB extra usage

More widely available 24/1M DSL goes for $46. Usage caps are unheard of in cabled internet.<p>Cheap, non-capped mobile internet has recently exploded - caps will be introduced. Our biggest telco TeliaSonera has only capped versions since the launch of iPhone (they were were forced and willing to pay extra). 
Other companies haven't introduced restrictions, but since Android-based smartphones became popular in 2010 and currently log the most data usage per unit, this will soon change.<p>Mobile internet is also very popular with plain computers by using 3G usb-dongles, which telcos give free of charge when you sign up for 12/24 months.

When I brought this up with my manager I was surprised yet again by the reply: ""yeah, we're supposed to move to Mercurial soon"".<p>I don't yet know why or how the decision was made to pick Hg over Git. It reflects a trend I've seen: I believe conventional wisdom has caught up with the benefits of DVCS's. When it comes to choosing one, Mercurial often wins out over Git. Why? The 2 most common reasons I hear are: windows support and simplicity. I believe the Windows issue is now a red herring - Git works fine on windows. So it must come down to the UI: Git is simply more complicated for most folks to use/master. As a result I believe corporate management often pick Hg more often than the open source community does.<p>What does the HN community think? It seems like the web has anointed a clear winner (Git). Meanwhile I'm bummed because I prefer Git and I feel it reflects poorly on our engineering team. Tools and tech stacks reveals a lot of a engineering team.<p>If it were up to me I'd advocate moving to Git and buying a license for Github:fi. Somewhat pricey, but very awesome.<p>Part of me is now hoping they stay on subversion so I can at least use git-svn and manage my code with git.<p>What are your experiences and thoughts?",1296458551

Capitalist countries are no better off with regard to this than other economies.<p>The problem is related to the fact that in the coming decades the energy needed to pump a barrel of oil will increase, up until the threshold in the far future where it costs a barrel of oil to pump a barrel of oil. And because modern economies are based on the availability of cheap oil, this change will transform or shatter these economies.<p>It's an universal cost. If it's not about the price of pumping and buying oil in dollars, it will be the time, effort, and availability of oil.<p>Like you said, serious work on alternatives is only as serious as dictated by the lack of availability of cheap oil.

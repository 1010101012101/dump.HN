5588588,comment,5587179,5587179,4,0,zamalek,,,"Uh no. This is completely wrong.<p>Ever tried to play really old games like Worms 1 on anything faster than 100MHz? They are ""framerate locked"" which means that a higher framerate makes everything go faster. So if you used that function on a 120hz display everything would run at twice the speed (assuming it's designed to run on 60hz). This is why things like Dos Box let you run at a lower emulated CPU frequency: so that you can slow things down so that these games are playable.<p>In terms of UI animation the most sensible thing to use is Euler Integration (pronounced ""oiler"").<p>Euler Integration is based off of Distance = Speed / Time. Basically what you need to do is remember the ""last time"" the function was called (using a high resolution timer) and find the difference between that and the current frame. This gives you the ""Time"" in Euler Integration, your ""Speed"" should be a fixed constant (e.g. 1 pixel per second). Then simply add Distance / Speed to your current X value.<p>Things git a tad bit complicated to ensure that you don't ""overshoot"" your target position, but it's nothing simple high-school algebra can't solve (that's the nice thing about Euler Integration, it's all high school Mathematics and Physics).<p>Techniques like ease-in/ease-out are easy to do (using the difference in distance between the current point and starting/ending points use base your speed off of that), all using high school algrebra.<p>I wouldn't bother with Verlet or Runge-Kutta: it is just UI animation after all - you aren't going for very accurate results like games do. ""Real"" physics engines also have the problem of not being able to guarantee deterministic results.",1366624203

It is ridiculously costly, time\n  consuming, and difficult to renovate or build anything in\n  SF. Add in a corrupt city planning process that was\n  deliberately designed to allow just one person to hold up\n  any project, large or small, and the result is a extremely\n  restricted supply of both residential and commercial real\n  estate.\n\n  Second, the most influential opinion-leaders and elected \n  officials are virulently anti-business. This has led to an\n  oppressive level of mandates, fees, permits, taxes,\n  licenses, and neighborhood activist oversight to be\n  imposed on all businesses, from the local mom-and-pop dry\n  cleaner to the few remaining large companies based in SF.\n\n  So, the combination of the influx of highly paid (or\n  already affluent) residents, an essentially fixed and\n  unchanging real estate stock, and a deeply ingrained\n  hatred of private economic activity by both politicians\n  and active voters result in places like the Grove being\n  penalized for their success. The problem cannot be reduced\n  to a simplistic case of rich tech workers throwing down on\n  starving artists.\n</code></pre>\nSource:<p><a href=""http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/04/21/san-francisco-hangout-becomes-casualty-of-tech-boom/?comments#permid=2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/04/21/san-francisco-hango...</a>",1366623244

But regarding the second point (proactive/reactive), I would <i>also</i> like an ecosystem of businesses that are engaged in some level of technological cooperation towards common goals. This over-reliance on Reader, for example, is an example of a bad ecosystem.

Those things don't matter in the short run to your user base, many of whom are loyal by necessity (switching is hard) or inertia (don't really care, it's the default choice), or who just don't know or care.

You go attempt to buy Bitcoins at the spot price of ~$100 each.  You see a message saying ""Your order has been placed, but to protect our customers, we are going to take the liberty of manually reviewing it.""  The following day, the order is canceled and the spot price of Bitcoins is now $140.  You are now effectively short BTC, which is unfortunate, because you're losing.<p>There are other failure modes.  They can be catastrophically expensive.  As both a buyer and seller of consulting services, the notion that you're worried about a ~3% charge to transfer money to settle up a freelancing engagement is valuable signal with regards to the general level of business acumen being brought to bear on this decision.  So, as somebody who wants both you and your freelancers to have happy, successful lives: bringing BTC into the picture brings in large extrinsic risks of project failure, when doing business with freelancers is <i>already</i> fraught with many risks.  I would suggest avoiding it.<p>Regarding accounting issues: I wouldn't expect any but if your accountant is like my accountant I'd expect you to run up a few hundred dollars in fees prior to him being comfortable signing off on there being no accounting issues here.",1366622827

But setting a global SOCKS proxy is ridiculously difficult: Control Panel -> Internet Options -> Connection -> LAN settings -> Advanced. Or assigning an static IP to a wireless card: Control Panel -> Network and Sharing -> View status -> Properties -> Select IPV4 -> Properties.<p>Now, OS X's Network panel is just as feature-rich as Windows'. You can do almost everything you can do in Windows too, but the implementation is much better. Creating a VPN, assigning static IP, setting a global proxy, etc. are all easy to access: Click '+' and select VPN, then its type (PPTP, L2TP, Cisco) and you're good to go. Or select Wi-Fi and go to Advanced menu and instead of DHCP select an static IP. Or go to ""Proxy"" tab and assign a global proxy.<p>That was just an example that I think OS X's implementation is far better, but the vision (= intention) is the same: Give user the ability to change everything he wants about the wireless connection. Just because Microsoft failed to give a decent UI (at least in Vista) does not mean it's not possible. Just like because Notification center is horrible doesn't mean it can't be done better (look at Android).",1366621685

For example, currently the AMD and Intel CPUs in the server market are both at the same level of process technology, 32nm, and Intel's CPUs are still overall superior.",1366621262

Human nature is such that population has always stabilized slightly <i>above</i> carrying capacity (being the amount of population that the ecosystem+technology can sustain).<p>We always slightly overshoot (carried by technology), and stabilize by those things you are mentioning (hunger, war, diseases, infant mortailty, ...). We just slightly overshoot not because of restrain, but because it is physically impossible to overshoot too much, since mortality increases very strongly (exponentially?) once we are above carrying capacity.<p>A civilized society would stabilize its numbers slightly <i>below</i> carrying capacity, so that suffering can be minimized and quality of living vastly improved. The more gap we allow between carrying capacity and actual population, the better our quality of life would be. But I guess we are not there yet.",1366621253

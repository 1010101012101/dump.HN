114020,comment,113901,113901,0,0,geebee,,,"My brother did this - taught French in a Louisiana middle school for two years after college.  However, he was a humanities major who went on to a PhD program afterwards; aside from a bit of stats in R, he doesn't do any hacking.<p>It was a good experience for him, and it is an admirable thing to take on.  He said that it was largely crowd control, and a little bit of teaching.  The schools that serve low income people in Louisiana are in pretty grim shape, evidently.<p>I don't think it would help a hacker much at all.  But there are things other than hacking in life, right?<p>I dunno, from the sound of it, I don't think it would be in the best interests a 22 year old hacker, who is almost bursting to get out there and work with an innovative startup, to step out of the game at age 22 to teach basic math in an underfunded school.  The excitement, creativity, and freedom you have at that age won't be there forever.<p>I'm sad to say that, though - because I personally <i>do</i> think that talented teachers make a positive difference, and I think that a more public-mindedness among technology workers would be a good thing (there's a strong undercurrent of distain for politics and legalisms - but if we don't participate, lawyers will be more than happy to regulate technology for us...)",1202828202

114014,comment,113838,113838,0,0,edw519,,,"The comments about 1968 showed how much has changed.  On March 31, President Johnson announced that he would not seek reelection.  So Hubert Humphrey launched his campaign in April.  Think about it.  That would be like Al Gore entering this race 6 weeks from now.  What chance would he have?<p>Also, the nomination defaulted to Humphrey when RFK, possibly the most charismatic candidate ever, was murdered in June.<p>Nixon had been campaigning behind the scenes for 4 years.  Add Vietnam, civil unrest, and culture clash, and Humphrey (the pseudo-incumbent) didn't stand a chance.<p>I agree with pg's theory.  We need charismatic leaders.  We crave them.  I often wonder how much different the world would be today if JFK, RFK, and MLK hadn't been murdered.",1202827204

114011,comment,113122,113122,0,0,pmjordan,,,"Best approach to micropayment yet. In fact, this one may well succeed. I can't think of a way to improve the mechanism - sure, it'd be nice if the tips were cash redeemable, but I realise it's not your fault, and you've made the situation pretty clear.<p>I know it's been mentioned by others, but I think your site layout needs a little work. In particular, your mechanism is pretty simple, yet you hide it in some text in your FAQ. Put up a ""how does it work"" page with a flowchart or something.<p>Oh, one more thing: what about mentioning the tip amount on the ""Tip this"" button? I know, it would make it marginally bigger, but I think it would help, psychologically. People are probably (well, I am) very wary to press a button that <i>implies</i> payment (if they've not signed up) or actually ""destructively"" affects their balance with no check-back confirmation. (if they have) Putting the amount right there would definitely put peoples' mind at ease.<p>I've not read your client-side code, but I'm guessing you guys have made a decent effort to avoid cross-site scripting fraud where embedded buttons are auto-clicked by a malicious script or something. Right?<p>In any case, keep up the good work!",1202826994

Maybe it's just a function of age but I seem to be getting more cynical.<p>There seems to be some sort of machine that runs the world. The American political system, despite being created as a government by and for the people is part of it.<p>I think you're exactly right: all things being equal, when it comes to choosing between a few popular options - regardless of whether those options are candidates or products, charisma takes the cake.<p>What seems to be <i>not</i> equal is the process by which the popular options become the popular options.",1202826677

114008,comment,113901,113901,0,0,yummyfajitas,,,"If you are a hacker (you are posting to hacker news), I suggest you avoid it.<p>I don't know anything about Teach For America specifically, but several people in my graduate program did work for a variant of it (local and math focused). None of them were happy with the program, though several stuck with it for financial reasons. One of them was put in charge of statistical analysis, since he was the only person in the room who knew what a standard deviation was (I'm not exaggerating). His conclusions:<p>1. Except for the grossly incompetent, teacher quality doesn't matter. He could not reject the null hypothesis (teacher quality doesn't affect student outcome).<p>2. Students do not benefit from being in the program, unless it removes them from a dangerous school. He couldn't reject the null hypothesis here either (accepted students perform the same as rejected ones). (This fact is usually well hidden: students accepted by special teaching programs as well as students who apply but are rejected usually perform better than students who do not apply.)<p>According to him, other programs usually get similar results (well hidden in the appendix of a report), at least when the results are reported.<p>Overall, he said it is a waste for a talented individual to go into teaching. You won't make a difference. As a software person, you will.<p>Leave teaching to people who can't do anything else. They have a comparative advantage (even if they lack an absolute advantage).",1202826559

Of course, since most people writing modular code will end up making a framework for their application, it's really Shelf Frameworks vs. In-House Frameworks.<p>Of course, there's also a third option, niche open source frameworks (every PHP developer and their dog has a PHP framework, and not all of them suck).  Chances are, if you look hard enough, you'll be able to find an OSS framework in the language you need that would be fairly similar to one you'd make yourself.

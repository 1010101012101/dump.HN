If you start at the company as a wfh person, or you transition to it and do it long enough, nobody in the office can put a face to your name.  Outside of your immediate group, they don't know what you do.  You're just a name on a chart.  ""Hey, look, without that box the chart is a little more balanced!""<p>In every company I've worked where wfh was tried (starting about 15 years ago), the wfh people were <i>always</i> the first to go when there was layoffs.",1301342358

There is a certain amount of 'shared context' that isn't part of the discussion.<p>Now programming isn't the same of course, and working at home when your single is different than working at home when your married which is much different than working at home when you have kids. Ever data driven, Google documented that people who had kids and worked from home had their productivity plummet between 2PM and 8PM. Is that bad? probably not, can you plan for it? sure.<p>If you're managing a team, you can get a sense for how overloaded someone is at work, when they are working at home it is hard to keep your employees from burning themselves out. (Some people literally don't know when to stop working)<p>By the same token a group meeting can be a great place to rapidly resolve a bunch of problems and to air a bunch of issues. On the phone you can't tell that someone is wincing when another team member is estimating 6 weeks for some effort, you can't know if they think that is aggressive or weak and why they think that, the conversation never comes up.<p>Finally, if the overall percentage of your conversations are in email, rather than speaking, you add to the distraction issues facing people rather than letting them work smoothly.<p>Bottom line, working from home has its place, but the value of being in the same space has its benefits too.",1301342275

So I made Housefed.com - an Airbnb for food / OpenTable for your kitchen. What do you guys think?<p>With 200 registered users, I launched it this morning and am opening the site piece by piece. I think people will not want to eat with a host without seeing their food first. So part 1 is aimed at photo-sharing and growing the community.  After a user has uploaded 5 pics, they can apply to become a host. Once there is an initial group of hosts, I'll open the site for meal booking.<p>Hosts will be able to create meals other users can book a seat at. Hosts will be able to filter the users prior to booking. Users will pay through the site prior to getting directions to the host's home.<p>I think this will be great for people who love to cook, love trying new foods, and especially travelers.  Trying real pad see ew with a Thai family would be mind blowing (at least to me).<p>In terms of the legality of booking a meal at a person's home, I am not sure.

The result of this? There's a growing community telecommuters that all hang out with each other, meet monthly, do hacknights, drop by co-working spaces etc.  It's actually pretty awesome because rather than just your coworkers you have this ""other office"" of people you get to learn from.  As telecommuting/remote working grows I think we'll see much better social interaction start to form, communities that are more based on what your passionate about rather than that you happen to share an office space. Additionally with remote work comes  a lot more flexibility, which means a lot more social flexibility, it's easier than ever to grab lunch with a friend an in entirely different industry.  I think basing social interaction around a 9-6 schedule and being locked in a building is much more damaging than the alternative.",1301342130

2379792,comment,2371753,2372913,1,0,6ren,,,"Maybe because you gave an opinion without reasons. (I'm the OP; I didn't downvote you.)<p>Both distributed computing and webapps rely on the network - that's why I think it's relevant. For example, ""the network is reliable"" is applicable, given outages. I'd be interested in you articulating why each of the 8 specific points are irrelevant to webapps.<p>> it would be equally applicable to ""native"" apps as webapps.<p>I think you're saying that webapps use the network, but desktop apps can too (e.g. ping, telnet, ssh, ftp, netcat, email clients, napster, etc), and so ""what's the difference?"". I find it an interesting perspective, because it's noting that the web stack is just a stack for network communication. There's nothing magic about it, except that it's broadly implemented (though there's perhaps some special merit in its REST architecture). Bits of the stack are even used locally e.g. HTML help docs; javascript scripting in Acrobat. It's no different from all the other (thousands of?) protocols and standards. I think this perspective, because it's looking impartially from the outside, and not assuming anything special.<p>Webapps of course don't have to use the network (apart from for delivery), such as a Javascript calculator (or game for that matter). And, with RIA, you can have webapps that have local storage, and theoretically are indistinguishable from desktop apps.<p>Is this what you mean? Have I articulated your position?<p>While I agree with you in theory, in practice most webapps do use the network; and most desktop apps don't. You might think this doesn't matter, but I put it to you that apps are not real things - they are merely shadows of the need they meet. Over time, they move closer to meeting that need. Thus, because webapps use the network, the standards, protocols, third-party tools and products, and developer wisdom and training all get better and better at that. While desktop apps take advantage of being local, and get better at that (though, I'd say this is mostly in the past, and I see little improvement these days). All the wrinkles and little problems and recurring deadends get ironed out (and often absorbed into the stack, so later developers are not even aware there ever was a problem). Webapps get network problems ironed out; desktop apps don't. As for RIA, it doesn't seem to have gone anywhere - silverlight is almost non-existent, I've actually never seen a javaFX app in the wild, nor an adobe AIR.<p>Therefore (assuming you accept my above argument that FoDC is relevant because it deals with the network), FoDC is less applicable to ""native"" apps than webapps, because webapps usually use the network, and ""native"" apps usually don't.<p>I've been speaking of ""desktop"" apps - I guess it might be different for iOS iPhone/iPad apps. Do they tend to use the network more? I would guess they might, for games' highscores and so on, but even if they use it more than desktop apps, the issue for my argument is that they use it less than webapps. And from playing with an iPad, that seems to be the case. After all, native apps have the advantage of being local, and so it makes sense to play to that strength.<p><i>I note that this would have been a much more interesting exchange (and you would have likely avoided downvotes) if you had articulated your position more clearly, instead of me having to do it for you. I hope you don't mind this admonishment, but i you have found this comment of mine at all helpful, I request that you at least attempt to put in as much effort in articulating your response as I have. It would be enjoyable to have an interesting discussion on HN, instead of the pedantic focus on peripheral points that one often sees - and as I said, you have an interesting perspective.</i>",1301342011

2379752,comment,2378027,2378651,13,0,muhfuhkuh,,,"""What happened to concept of developing a great product that actually takes some effort?""<p>That doesn't fly when you only want to make a living doing what you feel is fun. Not everyone wants to become a titan of industry. The brass ring resizes to fit many hands, not just really big and ambitious ones. ""Go big or go home"" is a philosophy for some, but not for all.<p>Put it another way, the chances of injury when swimming in the shallow end are minimal compared to swimming with sharks in the deep end. Sure, that's where Zuckerbergs and Brins and Ellisons all swim, but not everyone wants that headache.<p>""but do it with a great product that you believe in, not with bs e-books and movie quote soundboards.""<p>First off, you're quite presumptuous in saying his e-book is ""bs"". Would you call ""The Intelligent Investor"" by Benjamin Graham a ""bs e-book""? All it does is dole out advice on value investing that even Suze Ormann dishes out every day on her CNBC show for free. Why would anyone buy Graham's ""bs e-book""?<p>And, one person's ""crap application"" is another one's ""purchased/downloaded application"". FWIW, I despise television shows like ""American Idol"", ""Tosh.0"" and ""The Jersey Shore"", but that doesn't mean that the producers of that show don't believe it. They know people are watching it, so they proudly produce and air it. If kreci made crap apps, no one would download it. But download they do.<p>With the preponderance of apps out there, what's the harm in creating a few yourself and having a go at it? ""Polluting"" the market? So, you would rather app stores go back to the featurephone style of curating a ""market"" of only 100 games and 100 utilities all costing $10 each and 3 dollar ringtones.",1301341286
2379751,comment,2378779,2378779,7,0,aridiculous,,,"I'm usually not a grinch -- and I'm currently in a good mood. But this article is just wrong, inside out.<p>How many times do we (Apple users who have no particular allegiances) have to say this: Apple products aren't winning because they're 'desirable'. I'm taking 'desirable' to mean socially hip, because otherwise this whole article amounts to saying someone likes something because it's likable. Duh.<p>Apple UX is dominating because they understand what users expect to happen when they interact with the device. The red herring that distracts most of the (good and bad) criticism of Apple is the 'look'. The aesthetic design is the icing on the cake, and quite frankly it intersects with the usability a lot, but it's not why the consumer is switching to Apple.<p>I'm not a fan boy. Every day I wish some other company would come out with a quality and usable laptop that fits my life so I don't have to advertise my allegiance to Apple (the exterior) to the pubic. I have an interest in NOT buying Apple. Similar to a lot of hipsters, I have weird neuroses about being judged in public for having something popular. Yet hipsters are still on their Macs. There's got to be something else at work besides the Apple brand, because believe me, these things are too popular to be hip at this point.<p>Does it piss me off that a 19-year-old girl has a MacBook Pro for Facebook and Word, while I make due with MacBook for much more demanding tasks? Yes. I agree with people who say that many users are paying too much for things they don't need. But I'd argue that a person who just doesn't want to be hassled is at least justified in paying the up-front markup price of an Apple machine.<p>Being good at design doesn't mean it looks pretty. It means you thought out your product enough to make users have an easy time. And the days of releasing crap stuff out to ignorant consumer and huge inefficient businesses is dwindling for a number of societal reasons including a younger workforce, open source, the success of web-based smaller business, and so on.<p>I have no problem with you using a home-built linux box or anything you feel comfortable with. In fact, if you can do that easily and enjoy it, that's a great situation and you probably saved money. But I can't recommend to anyone I know to buy a Windows machine: It's simply an inferior product with fewer advantages.<p>If that offends you, I'm sorry. But look at the stats: Do you really think the tremendous amount of consumer Apple growth is simply due to its hip appeal? If that's the case, every person I see outside an office building is hip at this point.<p>Phew. Sorry for the rant.",1301341274

No doubt about that.<p>But I've worked with a fair bit of designers in the 'creative' industry and the good ones could go on 99designs and win close to every competition they entered (barring terrible taste from the submitter).<p>The lesson is that separating great design from good design isn't subjective (as opposed to some kinds of art) and I've noticed that design is one of those things that only delivers an effective punch when it reaches a certain level of quality. Once it hits that level, it has a disproportionate amount of power to influence potential customers, particularly in spaces that aren't used to great design (b2b products, etc) and the majority of the non-tech public.<p>That would lead me to believe that, for the long term, it's far better to hire out a reliable, kickass conceptual designer (freelance contract/hire) that can consistently make everything you release look cohesive e.g. e-mails, business cards, website, t-shirts, etc etc. These hires/contacts don't even have to be that expensive: You just need to know where to look and recruit from e.g. NOT Internet boards.<p>If I was a small startup just looking to gain some traction, I might use 99designs, but with the understanding it was a temporary solution.

As a language that takes a long time to master, changing fundamental features of the language every 3rd year, for instance, would be a bit difficult to keep up with. Furthermore, the niche C++ lives in isn't one that needs to change every year. For some users, language stability and backwards compatibility are key, and with things like Boost, additions to C++ can be tried out in the wild for many years before being standardized (as many features slated for the newest standard were).",1301339479

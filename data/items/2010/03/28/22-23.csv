1225342,comment,1224923,1224923,0,0,zck,,,"Are any of these non-mainstream opinions? Of course the first three are now, but that doesn't matter (I don't care to think what ""mainstream"" opinions of computing limits are). I'd wager you can't find a successful person from one hundred or two hundred years ago who had an opinion that would <i>today</i> be considered non-mainstream. It's like when people try to argue against Darwin, saying he was racist -- it was the mainstream opinion of the time.<p>Besides, all four quotes are bad examples. Nietzsche's quote has to be looked at in the context of the 1880s. Certainly that opinion was quite mainstream then -- the first woman to be awarded a PhD in Mathematics was only in 1886 (source: <a href=""http://www.agnesscott.edu/lriddle/women/firstPhDs.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.agnesscott.edu/lriddle/women/firstPhDs.htm</a>).<p>Carnegie's quote -- ignoring the part about race -- is a simple history question. <i>Was</i> there ever a ""danger of war"" between Germany and others? I won't try to answer it, as I don't know. Either way, what matters is what other people thought at the time.<p>Einstein's quote is simply about facts. Was there the ""slightest indication"" that nuclear energy was possible? Science marches on -- before the industrial revolution, was there the slightest indication that horseless carriages were possible?<p>Von Neumann's quote makes more sense when you think about the theory of computation. Computers today still run on the Von Neumann architecture from the 30s and 40s -- any progress has been optimization, and does not push the limit any farther. You still can't sort a list in less than O(n log n) time, or sum n values in less than O(n) operations. As far as I know it, the only thing to push the limits of computing is quantum computing, which is currently in its infancy.<p>Of course, none of this means that you should think <i>only</i> ""mainstream"" thoughts -- if you never ask what else is possible, you won't do anything new. But progress marches on -- <i>everyone</i> has mainstream opinions today that will be non-mainstream decades hence.",1269814568

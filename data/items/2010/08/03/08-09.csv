It is not any lawyer's job (except one you have hired) to precisely define which behaviors of yours they think violate the law. Thus, lawyers use the law as a lever to facilitate much greater benefit to their clients (to the detriment of whomever their client has targetted). This is a major factor why lawyers get paid so much.",1280825708

There are so many bits that you can easily ""waste"" a few of them for tags. The downside is that you most often really just need only a handful of bits and it looks like Jaegermonkey lavishly uses 32 bits for tagging of 32-bit pointers.<p>Of course, thinking optimistically, the new approach is better if you can at least carry some satellite information in the 32 tag bits, like object origination/permission/context data, or some length/offsets for (sub)strings. Also, locality is probably better, heap allocation is eliminated, and for 64-bit registers and moves this is a natural fit.<p>But I would have liked to see those 61-bit integers for the same amount of money.",1280823842

The robots did it!' and then we went into the 20 most prosperous years humankind has ever known. I hear people cry left and right that today's job loss is systemic, but I hardly see any factual arguments to support that position. Jobs were cut over the last two years, this quarter profits are back up, and if those improved profits repeat themselves for a few quarters the confidence will come back and more people will be hired. A regular business cycle, even if the nature of the drivers is changing.<p>Now I'm not saying it doesn't suck for those without a job, and I'm sure some people have it really rough, but come on like Jacques says - today's poor (in the West) live lives 10 times better than the kings of 500 years ago. I'm sure that's no consolation for a welfare mom who has to put her children to bed some nights crying because they're hungry, but overall, these are still great times to live in.

Ever since I started my own business podcasts have taken over completely from movies and tv as my primary source of entertainment. Here are my favorites:<p>1) The Adam Carolla Podcast - Its not heavy material (this is my daily candy entertainment) but I marvel at how well Adam communicates and improvs-- he's been doing radio for over 10 years and he's the most consistently funny improv guy I've ever heard-- he constructs some pretty complicated comic maneuvers in real time, like call-backs and alliterative rhymes and stuff... anyway the guy is a mench<p>2) This Week in Start-Ups - I think @jason 's podcast is the currently the best consistently produced business related entertainment on the web (second is now defunct UK version of Kitchen Nightmares by Gordon Ramsay, watch out you might get addicted) sometimes interview podcasts can frustrate you with their non-sequitor randomness but this show involves experienced high-level tech entrepreneurs in pitch reviews, business advice, and news commentary. There are also some pretty awesome narratives to the show, like Jason getting in random fights, confronting celebrities, calling out other entrepreneurs, and starting businesses on the show. GREAT stuff.<p>3)Fresh Air - The most entertaining and insightful interview podcast I've come across. Terry Gross interviews people who do interesting shaz and she asks really damn good questions.<p>4)Mixergy - Andrew Warners show is like entrepreneurial popcorn, its fun to hear what other folks are up to. Andrew pretty much seems like the nicest guy ever and is really good at pulling out interesting stories from his guests.<p>5)This American Life - Finds SUPER interesting stories, tells them awesomely, and from time to time if you are alone in your car you might pop out a tear or two. Very pro.<p>6)Internet Business Mastery - The content might be a little beginner level form many HN users, but if you are just getting started marketing an internet based business, these guys have some really professionally produced episodes (100 now) that walk you through every single aspect of setting up a blog based marketing type business. Not much start up or tech info, but lots of good mindset and basic business 101 stuff. This really helped me out when I was making the transition to quit my job.",1280822767

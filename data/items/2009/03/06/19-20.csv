505877,comment,505174,505174,0,0,Allocator2008,,,"Really this result is consistent with the Everett - Wheeler 1958 thesis that the wave function never collapses. This I have held to be the case personally for a long while, and in light of that, this new result is not surprising.<p>When you get right down to it, it is basically saying the wave functions of the entangled photons do not decay since they are never directly observed. Extrapolating from this one can say that in fact Wheeler and Everett were right, and the wave function never decays at all. Which of course leads to the ""branching universe"" idea, which to me will one day be seen as no more surprising than the ""many galaxies"" idea. Remember, the idea of other galaxies before the discoveries of Hubble and so on used to be only speculation, not universally held. Now we know there are at least 10^10 galaxies. Similarly the fact that the wave function never collapses, as Everett and Wheeler proposed will be held to be just as prosaic as the fact that there are other galaxies.",1236369359

505863,comment,505498,505498,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"We do both.  Our company builds 90+% Open Source software, and a small chunk of proprietary code that sits on top.<p>Our Open Source products have millions of users.<p>Our proprietary software has thousands of users (well, actually one thousand and some hundreds...I don't think we've crossed the 2000 licenses sold mark, yet, but it's getting really close).<p>So, in one sense (raw numbers), we can't compete with Open Source.  Even with our own software.  But, when I look at the percentage of paying customers we have that we wouldn't have without the Open Source products, the math begins to look less depressing.  Maybe we just have a really high marketing budget made up of lots of development hours spread over the past 11 years...and over time we'll convert more and more of those Open Source users into paying customers.<p>That said, it's definitely possible to convince people to pay for software.  Just make it better, easier, better supported, and more predictable over time (make upgrades that work, for example; almost nobody gets upgrades right, including most Open Source software...so if you do, people will remember it and won't be nearly as tempted to try a new product every time a major upgrade or new system is needed).<p>Also, it matters who you target.  We have some Open Source users who want our commercial products to be even cheaper, insisting that we would sell <i>huge</i> numbers if it just cost half as much.  But, I know the reality is that the difference between free and $69 is almost as big as the difference between free and $138, in terms of how many people will make the leap.  So, targeting the low end of the market for a product that has Open Source competition is insane.  Target the high end, luxury end, or enterprise end.  Power users, Apple users, professionals who make a lot of money by using your software, etc.  We actually decide what goes into our Open Source vs. our proprietary product based on whether it helps someone make money.  That's pretty much our only determining factor: Does it make money for the customer?  If yes, it's proprietary software.  If no, and there are lots of cool non-commercial uses for the feature, then it goes into the GPL version.  That won't work for everyone...but it works for us, since our market is one that has a pretty clear divide in who uses the software and for what.",1236368266

I commented with my unvarnished opinion long before your Facebook lawsuit [1].<p>Congratulations on your small-claims win against an unprepared Google paralegal; Google <i>should</i> be held to account for cryptic and arbitrary policies that retract credited balances from users' accounts.<p>However, in your own writings and lawsuits, you give me the impression that you are a legal gadfly rather than an entrepreneur. That can be a fine niche in life, and the press loves it, but you shouldn't expect a warm reception from aspiring entrepreneurs. Successful businesspeople often have to waste precious time and money defending against, and sometimes even paying off, legal gadflies --  even when the claims are meritless.<p>[1] <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=49294"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=49294</a>",1236366801

It basically shows that the best programmers have incentives to work on free software. It also shows that the price that the proprietary software maker places on the product directly affects the number of programmers working on the free alternative.

X-day is the day that IP address scarcity <i>begins</i> to become a problem, not the day that the intertubes burst and flood everyone's basement.  We appear to be headed for an IP shortage because IP addresses are presently distributed by a central authority, ""to each according to his need"".  IANA allocation policies undercut the fair market value of IP addresses, so the free market that could exist for them currently doesn't.  But once IANA stops handing them out, there's nothing keeping it from forming.",1236366314

Soon after that, they added the ability to place ads on specific sites...but not the ability to say, ""anything except spam sites, including Google's own spam domain hosting service"".  Of course, Google doesn't talk about their own spam domain hosting service much.  But, it's clearly Google being evil.

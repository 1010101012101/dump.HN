It's hard to keep an entrepreneurial type around too long unless your company is the kind that's always launching new products or projects. If you want someone to build and maintain a system with a 10-year horizon, it's probably not going to be the same kind of personality who makes for a serial entrepreneur.",1274000223

Even assuming that no Logic users upgraded from the Atari ST to the PC, I think the point still stands that six or seven years is a long time to sit in front of the same piece of software. It's a heck of a lot of ""continuing professional development"", of setup tweaks and hacks and workarounds and little bits of expertise.<p>The extent to which those skills accumulate is highlighted by the fact that ""Pro Tools Operator"" is a job title in the industry, and that their pay varies more widely than that of session musicians. Using a DAW isn't just a secondary task, like a writer uses a word processor - at the high end, operating a DAW is a job in itself. People have built whole careers simply off the back of being very quick at piloting Pro Tools. Being told that your DAW is being discontinued is a bit like being told that all your old electric guitars are obsolete and won't work with new amplifiers. It's vaguely tolerable if you're a hobbyist or an artist who can afford to be fussy about their kit, but if you're a professional who needs to get the job done every time, it's a catastrophe waiting to happen.",1273999984

1351708,comment,1351630,1351666,0,0,AgentConundrum,,,"Thanks for all the information. This is really helpful.<p><i>You can operate a sole proprietorship under your own name</i><p>Wouldn't this make some businesses uncomfortable, preferring to give money to ""MyProfessionalWebsite.com"" rather than ""Jesse Hartwick""? Is the ~$50 business name act essentially like just an alias, telling the government/taxman ""money paid to MyProfessionalWebsite.com should be treated the same as if money were paid directly to Jesse Hartwick""?<p>You also mention that this is paid to the provincial government. This is most likely out of the scope of your expertise, but how would this work if I moved? I currently live in Halifax, but might possibly be moving to Edmonton for work in the near future. I'm also from Kingston, Ontario and would one day like to move back home (to Ontario anyway, not necessarily Kingston specifically).<p><i>There is no dollar limit on this.</i><p>I wonder where I got the $30k number from then. Thinking back I think this might have actually been ""after $30k you're paying taxes you don't need to"" or something. Less of a rule, and more of a best practice.<p><i>Incorporating: This has two major effects.</i><p>I looked it up, and apparently the minimum cost for incorporation in Canada is $200 (plus lawyers fees, if applicable). I'm almost hesitant to go this far at first, since it feels like the risk is relatively low (a moderately well written terms of service/use, a well written disclaimer, and a policy of providing full refunds for even minor disputes - though I'm planning on providing this for free for a few months to get the ball rolling anyway - should hopefully take care of things until I get a job and can pay to incorporate. Who knows, my new boss might take issue with the concept in general and the business will die before it starts.<p><i>you file a ""statement of business activities"" as part of your personal income tax return.</i><p>Sounds easy enough.<p><i>probably need to collect GST</i><p>Is there a guide to such things that you know of?<p><i>only for customers who are (a) canadian residents, or (b) registered for GST</i><p>If this is targeted to Canadians, I'd assume this becomes a blanket ""yes, collect GST"" statement. I'd need a GST number for this, I believe. How hard/expensive is such an acquisition?<p><i>gives you a choice of whether to register for (and collect) GST or to pretend that it doesn't exist</i><p>Given the option, I'd just as soon collect it always, and from the beginning, so I don't need to worry about it later.<p><i>Credit card processing sucks. I just use PayPal.</i><p>Duly noted, though the same ""would businesses take me seriously"" caveat applies. My site would attract largely different clients than something like tarsnap would.<p><i>If you're handling credit card numbers (i.e., not going through paypal)</i><p>Given what you just said, it definitely seems like I'll just deal with PayPal and be done with it. Have you had any problems with them, by chance? There seem to be a lot of complaints about PayPal suspending accounts and generally being unsuitable in a lot of cases. I've heard of other alternatives (e.g. transaction.net, google checkout, etc.) but wasn't sure how things worked in Canada and I haven't had the chance to really dig into the issue yet.<p>Again, thanks for all the information. You've been extremely helpful and you've put my mind very much at ease about starting this. I couldn't imagine the government really making it difficult for people to start businesses, but you never know.",1273999660

1351706,comment,1351632,1351632,0,0,_delirium,,,"It depends on the person or project, I think. I personally work badly with someone over my shoulder; it somehow gets me totally out of the problem-solving/coding zone and makes me extra self-conscious. Same for writing text, actually--- some people can collaboratively write articles or books while sitting at the same computer, or live online in something like Etherpad, but when I've co-written things, it's always worked much better if I could write some bigger chunks on my own, at least on the level of paragraphs, before trading edits/etc. with my collaborator. Partly perhaps it's because I use the text-editor (in both cases) to externalize work in progress and brainstorm, often typing stuff that's clearly wrong and not the final product, before I get to rearranging/editing/fixing it, and it feels weird to have someone in real-time reading my scribbles as I'm working something out, when it's not yet intended to be anywhere close to done / ready-to-review.<p>On the other hand, I know other people who love people watching them code, and people who work really well writing English collaboratively too.",1273999554

There's no contract that says you have to keep updating an application forever, can never sell the company/app to anybody, or have to maintain all hardware implementations for eternity. If there were it would be much more expensive. They took an economic decision that made sense for their employees and shareholders - to do otherwise would be shafting <i>them</i>. You can still use what you had used for X years - it just won't be improved. If it had so many years of work then it's likely still useful.

The problem here is first that the person who pays for the service (the merchant)  is not the person who decides what processing network to use (that's the consumer, deciding which brand charge card to get. )  This is further distorted because the fees that the payment processors charge are partly given back to the issuing banks who then give some of that back to the consumer.<p>so... as a merchant, either you pay exorbitant fees to a credit card processor, and essentially give a discount to every one of your credit card customers (but not your cash customers; the visa agreement states you can't discount your product for not using visa)  or you turn away the charge card sales.

The publishers handily put a notice about that in the front of the book.<p>If that doesn't make something a commodity, what does?<p>On top of everything else, everybody with a Kindle who's bought more than a couple books has noticed that over 30% of them have horrible, amateurish formatting & OCR/character replacement errors.<p>And on top of that, at least in the tech/nonfiction industry, publishers have drastically cut back resources & services offered to authors. O'Reilly, for example, wasn't planning on paying anyone to tech edit my book. They were hoping for volunteers, at a chapter apiece, instead of one person with a consistent viewpoint thru-out.<p>That screws authors and it screws readers even more.<p>As a person who did paid tech editing work for Que, Sams, McGraw-Hill & other publishers I can't even remember, I found this ludicrous. (And those publishers regularly told me I did the best work they ever had, which is saying something. Furthermore, I know most of my changes were never incorporated, probably because they ""took too much time."")<p>Basically, publishers are shitting where they eat & are too stupid to realize it, or too terrified to admit it, and instead, they are crowing about how the ""consumer"" is stupid, horrible, no good, very bad, and just damned stubborn.",1273997398

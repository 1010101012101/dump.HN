4283459,comment,4282878,4283059,20,0,ChuckMcM,,,"The problem is provisioning and managing networks in a large scale data center deployment. And while networks are reasonably simple in the small (Hey plug in the cable and the light goes green, done!) in a larger (> 800 or so up to thousands and thousands) network lots of little things need to be dealt with.<p>When Google first started building their own switches I thought it was the stupidest idea ever. But when you look at it objectively, having the connectivity is essential and putting the 'smarts' in a place where it can be easily updated/modified/copied etc it vital. The network is just wire and switch companies put a lot of 'value add' in their switches which basically puts their second tier network programmers writing code you can't code review but can kill your network at any time. At Blekko the few outages we've had were <i>all</i> caused by a switch software programmer. How scary is that?<p>So if your wondering, what this means for the rest of us, it means there is a market for a rock-solid-dumb-as-a-post set of switches that do absolutely nothing to the traffic except forward it. They restart in milliseconds, not seconds. They achieve lowest cost per port because they have very little firmware, and the firmware they do have can, for all practical purposes, be proven correct.  The money is spent on really reliable transceivers and low noise cross connects and just enough SNMP work to give the upper levels of the system a clue as to whether they are overloaded or not. They <i>might</i> do link aggregation. We'll see if they appear or not.",1343084153

What kind of person spends that much on a car, then keeps it for 8 years?<p>I mean, Tesla, I think, did the right thing by going for the luxury market; people there are accustomed to considering a ten year old car essentially worthless.     (Yeah, a ten year old BMW still runs, but for what you pay to keep it running, unless you have the auto repair hobby, well, you probably want to get a new one.)<p>Battery longevity is going to be a huge problem when these cars move to the economy market.  But for the luxury market?   I think that the technology is just fine.   Using an 8 year old car, to them, would be like me using a cellphone from the '90s. (Personally, I think Tesla needs to be careful to provide luxury service;   Charge a little more and roll that 8 year 'no questions' battery warranty into the purchase price.  I mean, if I'm going to spend $100,000+ for a car?  clearly I'm not trying to save money... but also clearly I expect a 'premium' experience.

Your example shows 29x29 pixels for a cell be for it's resampled down. (2900%) so 841 possible shades of grey, (minus the artifacts from converting to polar and back.

Also, I am not really interested in any other projects that do the exact same thing I often like to reinvent the wheel, just for the experience.<p>I work as a front-end web developer, and whenever I am about to push a site live, there is usually a huge list of bugs and general issues to fix, before a website can be seen by the public. The lists of bugs, are generally created by non-programmers, which means they really only care about the content of the site (ie grammar, spelling etc) If I can fix all of the programming related errors before they get a chance to make these UAT lists (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_acceptance_testing#User_acceptance_testing), it makes my life and their lives easier. One of the most common problems are bad links, as I hardly ever click each link that I create. I created this tool to test all links found in every html file, found in a target directory, recursively; and generate a report on the results. If the script finds an internal/relative link, it checks to see if the file exists; if the link is external, it does an http request.<p>I wrote this script in perl and made it work like a unix command line tool; I eventually want to make it a real command line tool, but I dont know how yet. Also, my co-workers who are not unix friendly, suggested that I make a web form interface to activate the script.  There are many things I can do to make this tool more useful; this version met a specific set of criteria for a project. Now that the project is over, I plan to expand this tool for more general use.<p>Let me know what you think, if you would use a tool like this, and if you want to help dev it.<p>Project: https://github.com/mathew-fleisch/Weakest-Link<p>Script: https://github.com/mathew-fleisch/Weakest-Link/blob/master/weakest_link.v1.0.pl<p>Sample Report: https://github.com/mathew-fleisch/Weakest-Link/blob/master/bh-eu-12-link-report.xls",1343083056

And that's part of my point: you seem to have developed the tip amount framework without any regard to the larger market. My point is that the <i>fact</i> that many people gladly tip their bartenders > $1/week is relevant to your project. In the real world, $0.25 is not a tip, it's pocket change. (Here's a list of suggested tips, note the conspicuous lack of tips under a dollar: <a href=""http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2006/10/12/basic-tips-on-tipping-how-much-and-to-whom/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2006/10/12/basic-tips-on-t...</a>)<p>The other gripe I have is that you match expected tips for a ""top open-source programmer"" with an average salary for a ""mid-career engineer"". Why shouldn't a top open-source programmer be able to make top engineer money (read: a lot more that $160k) with Gittip? And why is there a max tip amount? What if my business wants to ""tip"" someone more than $100/mo? (I know, it's insane to think that code would be worth that much but to some it may be.)<p>So I guess I would ask you to reconsider:<p>1) The signaling issues around the idea that a quarter or a dollar is a reasonable amount to contribute for good programming. How do you explain to non-techies why <i>your</i> work is worth so much more than that?<p>2) The expected top end of the range for super-successful devs probably shouldn't be in the range of what recent grads are making at top firms.<p>Again, I'm trying to be constructive, and I think that if you want to meet your goals of helping programmers find a living building open source software, you could do a lot worse than asking folks who choose to tip to do so in amounts that are commensurate with the education, training, and thought required to build useful open source software.<p>Anyway, good luck with your project.",1343082794

Not flirting with them, or hitting on them, or asking them out, or ""sexualizing"" them.  Just working with them.<p>First of all, I generally refrain from seeing women as holding the potential for interaction of any sort in any sort of setting.  Mostly because I generally don't interact with them, but also because I am bad at socializing in general and also because I have personal priorities to take care of before I am willing to attempt dating again.  I'm short, not particularly attractive, I have a health issue that causes me to feel and look fatigued a lot of the time, and I'm not particularly well-off financially.<p>So I get that.  No female in a working context ever wants to date _me_ or have any interaction with me outside of a professional one.  I got that many years ago.  Thanks for re-iterating that.<p>Anyway, I can understand that women are tired of being hit on at work.  They are just really really sick of it.  So I get the motivation for your comment.  But to suggest that, based on my comment, I was ""sexualizing"" women was not fair or accurate, and the reality is that some of the women who attend a hackathon would not mind one single bit if a man who was there who they felt was attractive flirted with them a small amount.<p>So I think that the truth is that not every woman in every circumstance in regards to every man at every event like that would agree that there is no potential for interaction outside of a professional setting whatsover with every man there.  Its worth emphasizing to keep things professional, but you definitely overstated things the way you worded your comment.<p>But anyway, don't worry.  If I ever attend such a hacker event with women (which I probably never will, realistically, I hardly leave my home, and I am really bad at making friends, even among hackers), I will never consider having any kind of friendly or otherwise social engagement or interaction with any of the women there aside from one that is 100% professional.

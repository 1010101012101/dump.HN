It&#x27;s <i>abundantly</i> clear that you&#x27;re advocating for secession as the answer to perceived flaws in the US&#x27;s Federal government. It&#x27;s also abundantly clear there are at <i>least</i> several hundred thousand people who are similarly dissatisfied with the Federal government. If there are no real barriers to emigration via formation of a new Nation-State (however small) within the borders of the old, then the chronically dissatisfied, immensely stupid, and/or foolishly impassioned will be sure to do just that at the slightest provocation.<p>The thing about a Federation of States is that the group gains a <i>lot</i> of strength and stability if its member states are in it for good.<p>> It&#x27;s not something I can answer for you in five minutes right now...<p>Oh sure. I didn&#x27;t expect an <i>immediate</i> answer to the question. I <i>do</i> hope you get back to me on this, though. :)<p>> ...Switzerland tops many charts and it actually employs direct democracy.<p>There are a couple of things to note here:<p>* Despite Switzerland&#x27;s &quot;direct democracy&quot;, you don&#x27;t consider it a shining example of a government that is well run. (I didn&#x27;t expect that you would, I&#x27;m just noting it. :) )<p>* This &quot;direct democracy&quot; has -presumably elected- intermediaries, and (from what I gather) the vast majority of federal actions don&#x27;t originate from the citizenry, and the <i>majority</i> of the <i>real</i> discussion that goes into shaping them is not open to the public. [0]<p>* The Swiss people must <i>not</i> be voting to decide even a <i>tiny</i> portion of what the Swiss government does. From Wikipedia: &quot;Between January 1995 and June 2005, Swiss citizens voted 31 times, on 103 federal questions besides many more cantonal and municipal questions.&quot; That&#x27;s three votes per year, on ten issues per year. I&#x27;m fairly certain that there is <i>no</i> state in the US that does so little. [1] I don&#x27;t believe for a <i>second</i> that the Swiss people <i>truly</i> consider a significant fraction of the acts of their Federal government.<p>* The percentage of the population required to bring up an issue for reconsideration by the citizenry appears to be just over %1. [0] Coincidence?!? ;)<p>> That last issue could be addressed by liquid democracy...<p>How do you prevent the tyranny of the majority when any given government -or even a <i>portion of a governed population</i>- can splinter at a whim? How do you address the manipulation of voters to act against their best interests when <i>everyone</i>, regardless of understanding or expertise on the matter at hand has an equal say in how to address a matter at issue?<p>If your answer to that last one is &quot;weight votes based on a person&#x27;s understanding and knowledge on an issue&quot;, (as you mentioned in your comment) then my question is &quot;How -exactly- do you plan to do this?&quot;.<p>Any reliable method will take <i>substantially</i> more effort than the vast majority of a given population will be willing to spend, [2] and <i>many</i> people are <i>sure</i> to disagree with an evaluation that means that their voting power on an issue they care about is less than a fellow citizen with whom they disagree. This gets even <i>more</i> complicated when such a person exercises their option to perform zero-effort secession.<p>Moreover, doing the research required to arrive at a suitable solution for real-world issues is <i>really tough</i>, and often <i>very time consuming</i>. I spent an hour or so digging around for those stats in my opening comment. I&#x27;ve spent probably another hour or two reading your comments and typing up all of <i>my</i> comments. This is all to kinda-<i>vaguely</i>-address <i>one</i> issue at a <i>really</i> high level! <i>Real</i> issues take days, months, or years of dedicated study to understand and come to an informed decision on. Some guy who&#x27;s working two jobs (or one job, and caring for kids) isn&#x27;t likely to spend his <i>very</i> limited leisure time <i>actually learning</i> about the issues that he cares about.<p>[0] <a href=""http://direct-democracy.geschichte-schweiz.ch/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://direct-democracy.geschichte-schweiz.ch/</a><p>[1] Given Switzerland&#x27;s size and population, comparing it to many US states is <i>entirely</i> appropriate. :)<p>[2] To elaborate: Weeding out the nearly-completely-ignorant is easy. However, it takes between days and months to rank the knowledge and understanding of medium-to-high-performing individuals. [3] If you&#x27;re <i>really</i> serious about weighting based on knowledge and expertise, then you <i>really</i> have to go the extra mile to try to distinguish between those who are merely <i>very</i> knowledgeable, and those who are the equivalent of a Gauss or a Newton when it comes to the topic at hand, no?<p>[3] HN is <i>full</i> of &quot;Man, hiring is <i>so</i> hard!&quot; and/or &quot;Everyone does hiring wrong!

10900099,comment,10887194,10894388,0,0,zodiac,,,"This is fascinating. I&#x27;m pretty sure the wikipedia page implicitly assumes that pirates are superrational (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superrationality"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superrationality</a>).<p>A group of superrational players may choose an outcome which is not even a NE! For example, two superrational players playing the prisoner&#x27;s dilemma game will choose to cooperate.<p>Conversely, Nash equilibria are no longer &quot;stable&quot; in the original sense that there is no incentive for any player to unilaterally deviate. The concept of &quot;unilaterally deviating&quot; doesn&#x27;t even make sense, because a group of superrational players will all choose the same strategy. The superrationality allows them to cooperatively deviate.<p>To demonstrate, I consider the smallest case for which your equilibrium strategy differs from the wiki pages&#x27; strategy, that is n=3. Suppose there are 3 pirates, A, B and C. Suppose the first pirate proposes that he gets all the coins. Then the state where everyone votes yes is a Nash equilibrium because no one has an incentive to unilaterally. However I claim that a group of supperrational players will vote to kill A.<p>Here is the proof of my claim (caveat: I don&#x27;t think this is actually a valid analysis - see next paragraph. however it&#x27;s the same level of rigor as the wiki page and demonstrates how B and C can cooperate to kill A, &quot;escaping&quot; the NE of both voting Y). C will vote No because accepting the proposal is the worst possible outcome for him (he gets 0 gold and no one dies; note that it is not possible for C to die), so strategies where he votes No in this round dominate strategies where he votes Yes in this round. B knows that C is thinking this. Hence he will vote No.<p>Explanation of caveat: actually, the nonstrict dominance proof in the above paragraph suggests that C does not know how B will vote and the dominance is nonstrict because of this unknown. However, since B and C are superrational, there is no such thing as not knowing how someone would vote; C knows that B will vote No, so the dominance is strict. However this argument seems circular (even though, because of superrationality, I think it really isn&#x27;t).<p>Unrelated point: If we ammend the rules of the pirate game to include another tiebreaker with lowest priority: that all pirates prefer to vote &quot;no&quot;, then your situation is no longer even a Nash equilibrium (much less a subgame-perfect NE). Then how many NEs are there in the ammended game?",1452757655

These arguments are often framed as being about copyright because obscures the other half of the problem, which is how these arguments ignore <i>doctrine of first sale</i>[1].<p>Case law has been confusing in this area, with cases such as Vernor v.

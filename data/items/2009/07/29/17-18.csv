It's only been about a year since I've discovered PG and only a few since I took up programming as more than just the occasional scripter.<p>2.) The market for web applications feels saturated, what happens when it collapses?<p>3.) As a single father I'm even more worried about being able to provide for my family. Not to mention the amount of chores around the house, and general repairs and preventative maintenance.<p>4.) I know ideas are supposed to be a natural progressive thing, but as someone else said, when you see your own flaws in every idea, or you have an idea that seems like such a niche market it would be hard to gain any share, it's discouraging.<p>As a counter point to all of these, my nature and spirit is in being an entrepreneur, my grandfather bootstrapped a food service company in the 50s that we sold in 2000, I convinced my parents to let me start an internet cafe/print shop when I was 17, which would have done well if I had more insight at the time, it still lasted over 5 years before I took a job for general IT support (which led me into programming, the missing 'creative' void I had been looking for).<p>If I was 21 instead of 27, and wasn't in the situation I was in, I'd be living at home working on starting my own business...I long everyday to work from home and be able to take a few months off every year to travel with the kids the way I never got to when I was younger (we were extremely tied down to the food service business).<p>There are a lot of variables to consider though, skillset being very important as well.

730495,comment,729925,730460,0,0,apinstein,,,"You can't independently choose your ""debt"" level with software! When you design feature X, it costs you interest in terms of support, refactoring, debugging, etc. If you think you can decide exactly how much that's going to cost you a priori then you should go buy some lottery tickets. Drag is a better metaphor in this case because you can have an idea from looking at the design approximately how painful it will be to support it, but you can't be quite sure until you test it in the real world (ie wind tunnel test for example). You can model/simulate it based on expectations of feature popularity etc, but you won't know for sure.<p>On your second point, I do agree that there is a strong salient aspect of the idea of interest payments on debt. Like I said originally, the metaphor stuck because it resonates. However, the idea of technical drag has this same exact concept; the more junk you bolt on to the car, the more it overwhelms your project, and your initial F1 racer becomes a UPS truck.<p>One could make a point about technical debt that technical drag doesn't have, and I'll yield it's important, is that it's pretty tough to have so much drag you can't move. Whereas debt service can flat-out sink you.<p>However I'd counter that if you aren't moving (ie have customers using your software) then technical debt isn't really a problem because you don't have to do much work to service software with no users. Whereas technical debt implies that you have to pay for the feature even if it isn't being used.",1248889370

I have had the unfortunate experience of having people digging up dirt on some of these people try to use comments I posted to the Internet against them (e.g., an extreme example of a similar situation is how difficult it was for Obama to shake the notion that Reverend Wright's opinion was also his own). Around the same time I had to undergo a security clearance. It got me thinking about the breadcrumb trail I'd been leaving online. If I could change my cryptic alias to something more readable I would. It just so happens the easiest way to randomly come up with a username was to use the script I use to randomly generate passwords with.<p>I've spent the past few years SEuO (search engine unoptimizing) my personal online presence including quitting Facebook and started signing up to new services with different aliases so that people can't so easily aggregate what I say. It's kind of embarrassing how paranoid that sounds, but there's the rationale. I don't mind defending my opinions, but I'm loathe to put my friends in a position, as one was, to try to explain my opinion when they might not share it.

First when you talk about real physical drag, the amount of drag per object is not a value assigned by a human person. You don't choose how much drag an object has. You can change the shape of the object to modify the drag coefficient but you cannot modify it independently. Whereas with debt, it is understood that this value is something that is your choice.<p>Secondly, with debt comes the concept of interest, which is the most salient point. The big problem with technical debt is that you can have a small amount and there are essentially no downsides, but the longer you avoid paying for it, the harder it is to avoid creating new technical debt when you write new code, the more technical debt you will incur, and the negative effects start to compound.",1248888565

I don't think this will normally help a developer who is denied the last payment - in that case, fair or not, the law will normally limit the remedy to one of suing for payment.<p>Of course, the problems can all be avoided if the terms of the contract explicitly state that no IP rights will transfer unless payment has been made in full. In that case, I would agree with your assessment 100% (I don't disagree with your other points either - they are good clarifications).",1248887086

You make a large number of investments, the majority of which have absolutely no value to consumers.  You abandon the losers, sometimes after much handwringing.  It is usually impossible to tell a priori which features will be winners and which will be losers, though experience and good technical judgment can improve your odds.  You can invest more in promising features to bring them to market quickly.  Doing so usually introduces lots of warts into the codebase which will have to be fixed later - but then, you'll have lots of money later to fix them.  But you have to be careful to avoid investing too much too early, before you've seen how the feature will actually play out, because then you build a giant monstrosity that collapses under its own weight before it can ever get to market.<p>Or we could accept that all metaphors are imperfect.  I'm going to continue calling it ""technical debt"", because most people - even if they haven't heard of the term - have some idea what I'm talking about when I mention it.",1248886987

I imagine that as a professor, as I age into my 50s and 60s and 70s, I would be an appreciated contributor in a loving community, and I imagine that as a start-up founder, I would be cast aside in my old age the way they do in Ik society.<p>I am now at the age when there's not much time left to go down the professor track and be successful.<p>If I wasn't trying to become a professor, I would do a start-up without hesitation.

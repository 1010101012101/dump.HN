An issue with taking the approach of hard-coding the result pattern to scrape is that it can break when the page changes. E.g., the author&#x27;s code has:<p><pre><code>  page_obj.find(id = &#x27;resultsCol&#x27;)
</code></pre>
If Indeed ever changes that ID, the program won&#x27;t work. In that respect, it&#x27;s better to dynamically figure out where the results are.<p>And as far as cleaning up unicode and HTML entities, I like the &quot;he&quot; project [2]. Within text fields these HTML parsing libraries don&#x27;t do a very good job so unfortunately this extra parsing is necessary.

There are reasons why &quot;E-Learning&quot; never really took off before the MOOC movement.<p>Some part of this is that text books tend to be written as reference material, and don&#x27;t come with a &quot;first learner&#x27;s cut&quot;, a path through the material which is suited for someone just starting to learn the subject.<p>Videos are a medium which seems to be easier to master for university instructors than really good teaching texts. Don&#x27;t ask me why...",1427698925

The two most clear readings are that over 50% of organizations use Go, or that over 50% of the organizations that have used Node now use Go (while still possibly also using Node).  I doubt you intended either of these meanings.  How am I misreading you?<p>EDIT: do you perhaps mean that over 50% of the organizations that use Node and have experimented with Go have decided to move forward with more Go projects?",1427698914

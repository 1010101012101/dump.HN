4033878,comment,4033270,4033673,0,0,mr_donk,,,"There's 2 parts to AirTunes (the part of AirPlay that Airfoil and AirFloat use), Sending and Receiving.  Up to now, AirFoil only used the AirTunes protocol to SEND streams to AirPlay devices.  If you reverse engineer the protocol you can send to any AirPlay device.  No problem.<p>It's harder to make an AirPlay receiver, because iTunes won't send anything to an AirPlay receiver that doesn't encrypt the request with the proper private key.<p>You can only get this key legitimately by licensing AirPlay from Apple (which is why all AirPlay compatible speakers are licensed by Apple).<p>Someone managed to extract the private key from an AirPort express by removing the flash chip and reading it externally.  They then published this ""stolen"" key on the web.  Prior to that, it was impossible to make anything that would receive AirPlay streams from iTunes, even though the protocol was widely understood (it's basically just RTSP).<p>A bunch of open source implementations on other platforms (PC/Mac/Windows) were released.<p>Rogue Amoeba's AirFoil speakers for Mac/PC included this functionality.  However, up until this last update, they never included it in their iOS application.  Their stated reason for this was they couldn't figure out a revenue stream to make this work (AirFoil implements it's own music transmission protocol.  You bought the Mac software for $20, then got the receiver software for free.  Under this model, making the free product able to receive streams from iTunes without the Mac software would have cut out their revenue producing server from the picture).  The latest release included this AirPlay receiving feature as an in-App purchase.  Since they've had the code to do this for a while, and it seems like this method is probably preferable to most users and therefore likely more profitable, the delay seems odd.<p>My speculation is, they've been using the ""stolen"" key, and were hesitant to draw attention to themselves by trying to get software using it approved on the app store.  Eventually potential profit won out, and they went for it.  It got approved by the (probably) less technically savvy app review team that doesn't know about the requirements of a licensed key to make AirPlay reception work.  It was noticed later by some Apple engineer who is familiar with the protocol and was then pulled.<p>Since the private key is necessary to make this feature work, they either needed to license it or use the ""stolen"" AirPort Express key.  If they licensed it, I don't think Apple would be pulling it.  Since Apple does license this to people, it would be unfair to their licensees to turn a blind eye to people using the ""stolen"" key.  If it became apparent they were letting it slide, it would lead to a proliferation of unlicensed (potentially crappy/flakey) devices that might not meet Apple's quality standards.<p>I think the speculation about Apple wanting to include something similar in a future iOS release is irrelevant here.  Maybe they would, but I think this reasoning seems more likely.",1338220587

It should be at the top.  What you've done most recently is the most relevant, right?  Put it right in my face.<p>- The first two sections are vaguely written in the third person which IMO doesn't help me figure out anything about you.<p>- I can't figure out if you have any formal higher education.  If not, that's cool, but because the resume is in a strange format, I can't tell either way.<p>People don't read resumes like they read a book, they scan them, then might drill into some details.  Changing the standard structure is like when Facebook changed to the Timeline.<p>To be honest, I've grown so tired of resumes in general that I just go to people's LinkedIn.

4033822,comment,4030816,4033491,2,0,strictfp,,,"Back then TCP was the best mainstream choice. Using UDP would have looked good due to its message orientation. But its limited message size, lack of re-ordering and congestion control would have disqualified it almost directly. TCP then looks better, since it has reliability, re-ordering and rate control. You only need to change the streaming functionality for senfing messages. This they did by using one TCP connection per message. What they missed, however, was that connections are expensive in TCP. There are a lot of handshakes and TCP probes a lot before opening the throttle, something you notice when downloading a big file. Throwing away connections like that is a waste. Ideally, you would want one connection per server and reuse it for multiple requests. This was done in HTTP 2.0, where connection:keep-alive was introduced. But TCP still has significant overhead and a slow rate control mechanism. It also does not allow multiple concurrent requests in the same connection. These problems are addressed by SCTP, which is really a great fit for HTTP and awesome in general. It is also message oriented. SPDY is another similar alternative, which is less general than SCTP.<p>But the point I was trying to make is that TCP was intentionally crippled by HTTP to acheive REST. Then people hack the restrictions of TCP and declare a new invention.",1338219780

Typing IS much faster, although using the windows version on a Mac can be frustrating at times, especially if you've used it on Windows first.<p>I also noticed some wrist fatigue at first, although I put this down to the lack of wrist support (I'd been used to working with a high support integral to my keyboard before this, and laptops where the keys are the same height as the wrist rest). A 7 wrist gel thingy has served me fine from a week after the Das arrived, although it does now look a bit dirty.<p>I've used it in two offices, for years, noone has complained about the noise ever.<p>And finally, I really like the number pad, especially when the numbers across the top have no markings - I still mash the wrong symbol keys at the top fairly frequently.",1338217247

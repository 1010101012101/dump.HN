This gives you reasoning where you can have it, and you use monads where you can't.<p>I'm just saying that same argument applies in databases where using a relational database allows you to separate your total code from your pure code. You use the value-based relational strategy where you can have it (necessary and sufficient for database management), and you use functional (or imperative) programming where you can't.",1238518758

(Nintendo owns the handheld market, and is one of the biggest game makers too, so it's not an apples-to-apples comparison.) For one, they're the most likely to abandon optical media as a necessity for their next player. Nintendo is very backward-thinking when it comes to media formats, consistently choosing cartridges and proprietary discs. By your own logic, that's pretty bad. (The Wii proves users really don't give a damn yet, but they may.)<p>They'll still offer discs, because a lot of people will still want to rent games, buy them as gifts from Best Buy, etc. But it won't be the only way to get any new game.

They're going to achieve the dream of streaming movie rentals to people in large numbers. They're already doing it with Netlflix, but they're still improving. I already cancelled my cable and now watch whatever TV I do through PlayOn or streaming from a PC thanks to my Xbox.

And that's great, don't get me wrong, but it isn't the only market segment.<p>Also remember, Nintendo has been playing 2nd or 3rd fiddle for a couple generations before the Wii, after having dominated for 2 generations. There's no reason to believe they won't end up right back there. That industry is tumultuous to say the least.<p>And even if you'd go with Nintendo, that doesn't make what Microsoft has done any less impressive. That industry is one of the most brutally competitive there is. So many people have come and go, big companies have tried and failed to get a toe hold.

But, the ability to reverse a vote, unless restricted to a very short period, would encourage group think and certainly wouldn't reduce the signal to noise ratio as you originally claim.<p>The number of mistaken up votes is probably a very tiny percentage of total votes, and accidental votes from multiple users on the same comment or post are most certainly even more rare.  So the odds any given 'noise' comment or post is accidentally upvoted up to a meaningful level are extermely low.<p>And group think is already a problem on any voting news site. Allowing people to change their vote after they can see how everybody else is voting would certainly not alleviate that problem.<p>So while allowing a change of vote would help out an individual on their rare case of accidental upvote or downvote, I think the overall community effect would be detrimental.",1238516613

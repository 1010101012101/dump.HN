A real man is someone who steps up like this--someone like you--not someone who implements file systems in assembly.<p>So here is where I might have some qualifications to offer. I&#x27;ve been a pro developer since before you were born. I&#x27;ve done orbital calculations, nuclear weapons effect mitigation, realtime hardware, done standards committee work...in so many languages (Fortran, Lisp, C, C++,...up through Swift), but there have been times when the development platform I&#x27;ve chosen has been one that was held in low esteem by a lot of programmers (BASIC, Perl 4 CGI years after Perl 5 w/mod_perl was common), or not even considered programming at all (e.g., Excel, FileMaker).<p>I chose these as the best tools for the particular job under whatever normal or bizarre circumstances existed, and whatever tool, X, I was working with at the time, I was known as &quot;the X guy&quot; by my coworkers. And those coworkers have changed again, and again, and again, so remember me as an X guy, others a Y or Z guy.<p>I eventually learned to just focus on being as valuable as I could. Usually, what people need most from me is not arcane physics or CS knowledge (darn it! I worked hard on that) but just my ability to find them a solution that is most helpful to <i>them</i>. The most helpful solutions are usually not technologically impressive, as it turns out. I&#x27;d rather build them some microservices in Go but sign them up for SquareSpace instead and fill in a template.<p>Turn your attention, not to other programmers, but to the people you can help with your skills and to their problems. Try to get a lot more of your professional satisfaction from being useful to people who need you and less from how elite you think you are perceived to be by other programmers.<p>Web dev gives you all sorts of ways to be extremely useful to people. Do it. Feel good about solving their problems and let it motivate you to keep improving your ability to come up with valuable solutions. Yes, I understand that building yet another CRUD web app to sell dog food or whatever doesn&#x27;t feel like curing cancer, but those people are trying to support their families, too, and it&#x27;s not easy, and they need your help.<p>At the same time, yes, I can relate to a personal desire to do technically demanding work (but do it for the personal satisfaction of taking on the challenge, not to impress other programmers), but the way most people get into that is not usually to get an advanced degree. They prove themselves valuable at less technically demanding work, work on side projects in areas that interest them to develop new skills and, at some point, they spot an opening to utilize (make useful) those new skills for their employer. If it works out, their job responsibilities might change. Do it again and again, and eventually they will change.<p>I hope that turning your focus toward the people who need you and away from other programmers can help restore your self-respect and motivation. Good luck.",1437301750

When you listen to a violin live, you&#x27;re of course not just getting the violin, but you&#x27;re getting all the reverb of the environment, the spatial cues created by sound bouncing off your body and around your ears, etc.<p>So taking a violin sound and then playing it out of a speaker, you&#x27;re playing into a totally different environment and it&#x27;s going to sound different.  If you&#x27;ve also captured the sound of the environment in which the violin was played, you&#x27;re then also playing THOSE sounds into a different environment.  The reverb still gets affected by the environment your speakers are in.<p>I think the closest you can get is binaural recordings done with mics worn on your own ears and then played back using suitable headphones.<p>Even that still doesn&#x27;t cover the tactile dimension of sound (think about the feeling you get when bass goes through large stage monitors).  There are products that try and reproduce this - I haven&#x27;t tried any of them but would be eager to, as I primarily listen to music with headphones.<p>Nor does it cover spatialization properly either - without some form of processing, the sound source won&#x27;t stay in position when you move your head.<p>A bit off-topic, but the more I think along these lines, the more I imagine the ideal music delivery medium being dry multitrack recordings with mixing and reverb supplied as metadata that&#x27;s then applied with real-time audio processing.

Sometimes it happened to me that after visiting a cool place I could not remember how to get there after some amount of time, but very often I had a photo from that exact place. It seemed logical to start the navigation to that place from Photos.app with only one tap. Being surprised that there is no such built-in functionality in an iPhone, I decided to create this Action Extension app, adding a necessary option of customizing the list of navigation apps for quick access. Additionally, the list of available navigation apps is server-side, which means it can be quickly expanded with new apps support according to user requests, without a need to wait for the whole app update on the App Store.<p>Please feel free to contact me if you need any additional information.<p>Project fb page: fb.com/pages/Navigate-to-Photo-iOS-Action-Extension/1591243044490085",1437301597

If somebody else works on the same code at the same time, then those changes need to be merged. Whether your VCS does or doesn&#x27;t call that a branch is immaterial. What matters is that two developers can work on the same code at the same time, and that you need to solve concurrent editing conflicts (logical ones, not just the textual ones that your VCS will find).<p>The pertinent question is <i>how often</i> you merge. On one end of the scale you merge on every keystroke. Every time Joe types a character it gets put into Anna&#x27;s files. Clearly this doesn&#x27;t work. On the other end of the scale every developer works on their own copy, and all the work gets merged just before a release. Clearly this doesn&#x27;t work either. There is a scale from maximal disruption minimal effort merging to minimal disruption maximal effort merging. You want to find a point on that scale that minimizes the total amount of work.",1437300190

This requires proper planning for big changes, and to break them down into small, easy to review, patches.<p>OpenBSD uses CVS as main repo because it fits their development style.
Bevore you knock down CVS look at AnonCVS and cvsync.

It even has exclusive locks which completely eliminate merge conflicts.<p>I&#x27;ve been building software professionally for almost 20 years, I&#x27;ve seen (and experimented) with almost every VCS/SCM strategy imaginable.<p>My conclusions:<p>This only really works for tiny teams - 2-3 people who work very well together. It needs high bandwidth communication.<p>For teams of 3-10 short lived feature branches are effective with a little bit of planning to minimize merge conflicts.<p>For larger teams you really have to split the system into self-contained modules or microservices, each module having clear owner. These modules are then shared as source, library or service depending on the actual needs.<p>I&#x27;ve never had good experiences with longly lived branches. They can work whilst adding experimental modules which require only a couple of tiny API changes to the main system; but then splitting the module into a separate project/repository and making the API changes (behind an #IFDEF) makes more sense.",1437300019

I thought he looked familiar, so I looked back over my shoulder at him again...  I didn't really recognize him but I thought he might have been somebody famous for some reason.<p>Anyway, when I got back to my car I saw that yellow mercedes, and when read the plate holder saying ""Mr. Linux.  King of Geeks.""  I figured out who it was, kind of neat.<p>At the time I don't think I realized he lived in Portland.",1332284382

But when you combine the draw of the valley, with the fact that most of the best developers got to where they are by the interactions they have with other developers.

However, the group of people who are against sexism are objectively much more culturally and economically powerful than the group of people who are against Dawkins. Heroku doesn't fear any lost business from supporting Dawkins, but it dropped Sqoot like a hot potato.<p>You could quantify this by comparing a Facebook-based StatusRank for the anti-Sqoots vs. the anti-Dawkins. The former group will have much higher socioeconomic status than the latter. Harvard graduates are much more likely to believe ""sexism not ok, Dawkins ok"" and high school dropouts are much more likely to believe the reverse.<p>That is, sexism is ""not ok"" and Dawkins is ""ok"" in this thread because these are the beliefs shared by the most powerful people in society.

The list is endless.<p>Usually it's best to not call attention to such things at all, <i>even in a positive way</i>.

Wise choices, all of them. A 2m diameter capsule would come in at 19,500 lbs, or so, for that many square inches.<p>Congratulations. You've just found out why we don't shield small spacecraft. Now, however, let's get an estimate of what it would cost to shield 200 people, providing them each with a volume-equivalent of your capsule, or 4.2ish cubic meters per person. Really packing them in. This is a 11.6-meter diameter sphere, with roughly 3,300 pounds of shielding per person. At 2000 people, packed in like sardines, we're at 25.2 meters in diameter and 1550 lbs of shielding per person. A 54-meter sphere packs 20,000 sardines, and requires a mere 717 lbs of shielding per person.<p>A factor of 10-20 better. Obviously, we want to relax the space constraints a bit. However, the form factor of shielding in the larger craft is going to be much better suited to the reutilization of supplies as shielding. In the limiting case, of course, there is effectively no required shielding per occupant. Long before that, magnetic shielding schemes become a viable option, too.<p>A more practical limit would be to consider a transport module made up of re-entry craft seating 1-10 persons, with the ablative heat-shields and supplies facing outward. In this case, assume we can get down to 5 times your cross-sectional area in shielding, and guess that that's about 2.5 square meters. That's 4000/lbs per person. So, still a factor of 5 better than the solo case.<p>Additionally, this is a lot of arithmetic to ask of google and <a href=""http://www.calculatorsoup.com/calculators/geometry-solids/sphere.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.calculatorsoup.com/calculators/geometry-solids/sp...</a>, so the numbers may be off. Also, the Dragon capsule checks in at 5.8 m^2 of heat shield per astronaut, which may be a practical limit. And I just made up the 1lb/in^2 shielding requirement.",1332282581

The point is that <i>these offend not only my anti-sexist sensibilities but also my intelligence</i>, so even if I were sexist I would still be offended by these and ask for their removal, on the grounds that they show that the mental model of me that the people responsible have is a brainless, easy to manipulate moron.<p>4) However, thinking that eradicating the above will lead to considerably more women in tech, I think, is mistaken. I believe addressing the issues that are less obvious but more influential in consciously or subconsciously turning off women is more important, e.g. rather than getting worked up when somebody uses the word <i>girl</i> in a post, thinking about the ""cool"" but male-oriented terms like <i>code ninja</i> that are prevalent in job postings (e.g. all of the 10 types of programmers mentioned here are all male oriented: <a href=""http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/10things/10-types-of-programmers-youll-encounter-in-the-field/262"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/10things/10-types-of-progra...</a>).",1332281892

SVG performance has come a long way  I've used SVG charts with 3000 nodes and it worked smoothly zoomed in on the 2048px iPad.<p>Also, rendering of individual font glyphs is not necessarily faster. Hinted subpixel rendering costs, and text rendering engines rely on speed savings from caching prepredered glyphs.<p>3. Possible, but admittedly ugly with `url(data:text/svg,)` in CSS.<p>4. I bet those icon fonts don't have hinting either, and autohinting designed for letters may deform icons.<p>5. You can reference external SVG files or put SVG in CSS.<p>7. SVG is styleable with CSS (although CSS internal to the file), so you have even more options for styling icons (e.g. you can have separate colors for fill and stroke or even each part of the icon).",1332281856

IF they had an open plan office, and were apologetic about it, then they might be redeemable.  IF they were proud of it, then idiots.  Seriously.  Sales guys in a big room, they probably benefit from the vibe. Programmers need distractions to be productive?  Really?<p>In fact, the last company I worked at had hired way too young, and they had a bunch of kids who thought that being in your office writing code was somehow ""Bad"" because you were ""siloed away"".  They liked to hang out all together at one big table, and chat away all day long with their laptops out.<p>In the time I was there, I don't think they ever realized  they were getting nothing done.  (I was curious as to whether they were onto something or not, so I tracked the number of stories and features they committed vs. me and my officemate who at 26 was the ""old man"" of the bunch, though still much younger than me he was old enough to know what flow was.)<p>Result: the two of us were about 4 times more productive than the 5 of them.<p>One of those five, though, was the ""director of engineering"" (20 years old) and was constantly chastising us for spending too much time in our offices.<p>When it became clear that this was going to affect my evaluation, I chose to exit that company. (They folded about a year later, never having accomplished the short term goal they were working on while I was there.)<p>But maybe I'm wrong. Maybe some people are more productive in groups of 2-3.  That's fine.  Set up offices for them to work that way.<p>Just let me have some damn peace and quiet so I can get work done!  (and I never seem to have a problem hooking up with other engineers to talk about architecture or what have you to keep us coordinated, though often this is via email or chat... which is much less interrupting than a tap on the shoulder.)<p>-----------<p>On further thought-- maybe designers and people whose job is to sling HTML or javascript don't need to have ""Flow"".  Maybe the jobs for these people are light enough that there is no context switching cost or the cost is low.  That's not the case for my work or my career. There's often a very large amount of stuff I need to track in my head... because I'm generally solving hard problems on the back end, rather than making UIs or web pages.",1332281771

Much that once was is lost, for none now live who remember it. It began with the forging of Three Networks. One was given to the Friend, the Professional, and the Socialite.  For within these Social Networks was bound the strength and will to govern each.<p>However, another Network was forged in the fires of Silicon Valley by the Dark Mark Zuckerberg  a Master Social Network to control all others  and into this Network the pariah poured his derelict social skills, his malice and his will to dominate all Social Networks.  One Network to rule them all Facebook.  A Network that consisted of meaningless updates and irrelevant photos bound to rare encounters, yet the people lived in fear of removal.  A Network run by advertisements and awkward requests.  One by one the Networks fell to the power of the Facebook. The power of the Master Social Network could not be undone.<p>There were some who resisted they were Friendsignia.  A last alliance of true friends and professionals who marched against the armies of Facebook.  On the slopes of Social Media Fatigue the fellowship fought for the freedom of meaningful networking across the land.  Friendsignia was the first Social Relationship Manager that provided insight to the strength of true relationships. Unlike the Fires of Facebook, Friendsignia wanted to bring interactions back within the realm of the living, not the deep confines of saturated social media.  Friendsignia provided a gracious tool set that allowed the fairest beings to harness existing relationships or even conjure new ones.<p>Join the resistance at Friendsignia.com and become part of the fellowship.<p>May the journey continue",1332281768

There <i></i>is<i></i> profit for all to be made in digital media and the phrase 'digital media' represents a far broader swathe of culture than people outside this type of community seem to realize.<p>The profit lies in the value the product adds to the culture and intellect or distraction of the consumers and nowhere else. If someone is valued by society for their contributions then, like the artists of old, they will find themselves supported by the population in one way or another.<p>Every other way to squeeze profit out of what is essentially non-human entertainment (i.e. once digitized the content can be recreated without another human adding any value to the work) is just a way ensuring that the less talented will continue to make less meaningful art at the expense of the whole society.<p>What Napster, and by extension the whole internet, did was generate a source and medium through which the mass individual could self determine quality and be exposed to more genres and therefore the ideas of musicians than what was ever before possible. It's major flaw, legality notwithstanding, was that it limited itself to music. The same approach clearly applies to all form of media that can be reproduced.<p>Clearly the repercussions of this way of thinking would destroy industries and create a new paradigm that the would will take some getting used to, if what I described were practically applied. Ultimately, I believe it will be resolved in a massive anti-trust case against the ever larger music labels/studios/cable giants/ISP's worldwide that will limit their monopolies and finally reflect the global nature of their industries.<p>We are seeing the dawn of a global culture. One that will survive and change so long as the human race does. To place a monetary value on access to that culture is not sustainable and will not last. IMHO lol",1332280921

It would be like letting players line up for a free throw in the wrong order, letting the player shoot and then blowing the whistle for incorrect order.""<p>That is completely absurd. Letting the players line up incorrectly would be the <i>referee's</i> mistake so, yes, it would be better to prevent the mistake from happening.

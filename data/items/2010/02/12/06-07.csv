Saying that a job is created by ""growing existing businesses"" or ""creating new businesses"" is insightful, as it gets back to the core of what is needed. As far as the private sector is concerned, jobs are created by growing and new businesses.<p>With the massive amounts of cash that has been thrown at shrinking big businesses in the recent past, it is important to recognize that over half of Americans work in small business, and it is the small businesses that are having the most difficult time accessing capital. Not just in the valley, but the mom and pop, brick and mortal business that should be considered the bread and butter of society.<p>Yes the author is focused on his own plight, in a slightly whiny and entitled sort of way, but that doesn't mean he doesn't have a point.",1265957927

1119959,comment,1119850,1119932,0,0,palish,,,"What a strange fear -- being afraid of not having health insurance.  I haven't had a ""real job"" or health insurance for about a year now, and I don't care at all.  If something bad happens to me, I'll put the bill on my credit cards.  I doubt anything will happen though.  I'm young, healthy, and don't get into car accidents by being stupid.  Statistics are on my side here, and I feel completely comfortable living without health insurance for awhile.<p>Unless you have some kind of condition, is there any situation in which the fear of not having health insurance is actually justifiable?  I mean, if you want to avoid paying off a huge hospital bill over time, then ok... but come on, if you're starting a startup, gambling a 0.001% chance (or whatever) that you might have to pay 4-5k off over a few years seems like an insanely good bet.<p>Also, I heard from a friend (who is very probably wrong about this) that you don't actually have to pay off a hospital bill.  It won't count against your credit score.  Is this true?  I would never do something like that, but... if not paying the bill doesn't count against your credit score, then I can see why people might not pay it.",1265957868

1119947,comment,1119539,1119929,0,0,whalesalad,,,"One of the ways that you can create a good looking button or clickable image is to set the background image of an element so that you can take advantage of features like :hover pseudo-classes. Sometimes you don't want the text to appear inside of that element, like if the text for your button is inside the image. The solution is using a huge text indent number (-9999, to take it off of the left side of the page). It's basically a trick. An em is just a measurement, equivalent to the width of the letter M.<p>You'll notice sometimes when clicking a link that you'll see the dotted outline text extend all the way to the left side of the page. That's because the text inside of that element is actually way far off 9999em's to the left of your display. Like a bad act getting pulled off-stage by the big long hook around the neck.",1265957029

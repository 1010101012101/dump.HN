I assume there are some internal delays (OS stacks, switches, etc) when synchronizing time inside a server group.<p>I mean, even if you had a picosecond accurate clock available for use inside a server farm, you would still need a way to query it with a known (not necessarily zero; just known) latency to synchronize several machines. Servers are not known latency machines (unless specialized hardware is involved).<p>How is that accomplished?<p>And what happens when two transactions happen below the system accuracy limit?

Unless we find a way to effectively create energy, or we find a way to upload onto a reversible computing substrate, or Dust Theory is real, or we learn how to do alpha-point/line computing, or something else that fixes the problem, our light cone of the universe is not going to be habitable for that much longer and every planck time step counts. While I can't speak for anyone else who wants to live well past 100 years, indeed well past a billion if physics permits it, at least for me it's quite the disturbing conclusion to believe ""time isn't running out, just be happy and focus on the present mon!""<p>I reject the notion that ""being happy"" is a binary thing or some plateau of state of mind one achieves for some duration, though I think the concept of happiness as a fuzzy cluster of feelings that make one say ""I feel happy"" is a useful simplification. There are many forms of happiness of many durations, some quite complex and dependent on many variables or past states of mind. The chemical soup in a happy brain has many possible configurations. Even when I feel super-happy I still wonder if perhaps there's a higher form of happiness I could achieve, and then I wonder what sorts of happiness I'd experience with a different mind design (which is why I won't wirehead indefinitely even though wireheading would give all possible forms of human happiness).<p>To me this post really comes across not as championing ""happiness is what matters"", but rather the more depressing ""be content with your lot in life."" No sah! That's for religious folk and for people who just crossed Atheist River but haven't finished questioning all their religious indoctrination! A better message I think is simply ""If you aren't feeling the way you want to feel, change something. You don't have to feel that way you know, even if changing is really hard and takes years.""

4831713,comment,4828724,4831024,2,0,tel,,,"The Curry-Howard isomorphism doesn't explain away mathematics. There are next to zero large and important theories of mathematics which have been formalized in a computer language. It's partly due to the difficulty of proof automation---the solvers are very young---but mostly because proofs are just the pickaxes for mathematics. Right now human-driven proofs are far more powerful tools.<p>Programming benefits greatly from a tiny section of mathematics and the more deeply the connection between the fields grows the more we'll see strong justification for universal patterns in programming and strong realization of abstract mathematics.<p>It's also a bit of a strawman to pick just number theory as the only field of mathematics to examine for practicality. Our world as we know it today would not exist without diffeq and your own example of machine learning really is just applications of optimization, statistics, probability, and abstract geometry.<p>""We need them both"" is an unrefined statement.

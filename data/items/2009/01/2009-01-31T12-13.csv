Eventually, since I was tracking the raw materials, I was put in charge of ordering paper.<p>We only three mid-sized printing presses and I was dropping just under six figures every month on paper alone. Of course, we weren't printing on the kind of paper you get with the NYT. This was higher quality stuff but you can get an idea of the costs involved.",1233406741

459519,comment,459393,459393,0,0,satyajit,,,"I am sure its possible. Apple has the right combination of marketing, technology and design to make what they are today. Having said that, its a recent phenomena - several years back, we all thought SGI made the mean machines, where are they now?<p>But I wish Apple comes up with something more killer product, diversify even more ... like you know, may be a car audio player. That will have the same wow factor of iPod/iTouch - somewhat internet enabled. So you can directly download/buy music into your car audio, and play online media ... and of course, it can double up as a iPhone and map device. Much of its out there already, but still its a scrambled market. Apple need to lead the way in usability. I'm sure Jobs can turn this into a multi-billion dollar franchise.",1233406385

459512,comment,458090,458556,0,0,10ren,,,"I usually dislike multi-page, but I was surprised that I didn't mind in this case.<p>I realized that it's the <i>latency</i> of multi-pages that I don't like. This site loaded instantly (for me).  A factor in this was that I adblocked all the ads (when I disabled adblock, loading was significantly slower).
I don't like waiting for page-loads. It breaks my train, and maybe also there's the uncertainty of whether I'll be able to finish reading, since pages sometimes don't load - this has happened to me.
Hmmm.. if someone cached their multi-page article in the client (<i>including</i> the ads) and switched dynamically pages with javascript, one could achieve the same effect.<p>These are also ""webapp"" issues, and I think why offline webapps (google gears, AIR, silverlight, javaFX) are so important. I guess it will also finally disrupt Microsoft's Windows platform, without needing a new hardware platform (previously, mainframes, minicomputers and workstations were disrupted by new hardware platforms - I don't see that happening to Microsoft).<p>I think I actually <i>like</i> multi-page in itself - it gives me a natural break, and also enables literal ""bookmarking"" (yes, like pages in a book) if I don't want to finish it all right now (or if I want to remember part). I actually wrote a little greasemonkey script to add in anchor names to headings on long essays (eg: pg's), so that I can bookmark them (with #).",1233405770

There was originally just a 60x60 in the sidebar on the front pages that's sold specifically for Metafilter.

459506,comment,458926,458926,0,0,jlouis,,,"Another point worth mentioning: Math in general is heavily interconnected. The more math you do, the better you become at it. A large amount of math is knowledge. That mess of symbols is something you will have to understand. As soon as you understand what it means, everything is just trivial.<p>My advice would be to start with some books you can understand and then build up there towards your goal. It may take a couple of years, but the time used are going to be paid back in masses when you hit other math problems: They suddenly got easier too!",1233404939

459504,comment,459393,459399,0,0,andrewl-hn,,,"Palm has a very recognizable brand, indeed. Besides there're not that many Palm phones around and it can help building 'uniqueness' of the products. Of course Nokia make great products, too. But their market share is just too bug to be an 'elite' product. Other manufacturers like HTC do not have such a strong brand like Palm.<p>The problem with Palm might be that Pre 'is just a beginning'. I mean currently they have very few models and that eases the choice for consumers. Apple does it very well unlike HP, Asus and others and I personally think that helped them a lot. Today when you say 'HP laptop' I get no idea how it's going to look like. But if you say 'Apple laptop' I get a clear cut image of a shiny high quality product.<p>Low number of models keep them recognizable among consumers. That's the key for building a strong recognizable brand. I think Palm will keep the 'cool' factor as long as they do not introduce very few new models. One or two WebOS-based phones is Ok but if there are going to be more they will become just another brand.<p>Anyway the great products (especially the first-gen models) are essential if the company wants to become the Next Brand. Google made a huge mistake with G1. Everyone I talk about it says the phone looks very low-quality and cheap. And it seems like Android is not going to be cool after G1.<p>I wonder what phone was the first to have a Windows Mobile. I suspect it wasn't a great phone.",1233404704

I admire people who are ruthless without hurting others, breaking the law, or otherwise being bad people. You can even learn from people who might go too far - I just ordered ""Titan"" about John Rockefeller from Amazon, along with ""Taiko"" about 1600's Sengoku Japan. Some ruthless men in those books - I try to understand and internalize the drive while spotting potential Tony Montana style pitfalls in advance.",1233403282

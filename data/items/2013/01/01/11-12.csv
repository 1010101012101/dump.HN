The problem is not that we are too bound to the Constitution; it's that we allow violations of it <i>at all</i>. Constitutional violations like warrentless wiretapping should get an entire administration ousted overnight.<p>If the Constitution is wrong in some areas, amend it. If you can't get enough people to agree that it's wrong, well, it sucks to be on the losing side of a vote, but democracy doesn't mean everyone always gets their way.<p>It's <i>supposed</i> to be hard to change the fundamental laws of a land, because we want to be able to rely on them. Gridlock is another word for stability.<p>>> Freedom of speech and religion, equal protection of the laws and protections against governmental deprivation of life, liberty or property are important, whether or not they are in the Constitution. We should continue to follow those requirements out of respect, not obligation.<p>We <i>should</i>, yes. We <i>should</i> follow them whether they were in the Constitution or not. We also <i>should</i> refrain from stealing and murder. But I, for one, want consequences for those who don't.",1357041596

However when using large capacity SATA drives, it most definitely isn't.<p>SATA drives (even ""enterprise"" SATA drives) have an official unrecoverable error rate of 1/10^14. From my experience, the truth is more like 1/10^13.<p>10^13 bits is roughly 10 terabytes. That means that every time you're reading 10 TB, you are statistically certain to encounter an unrecoverable bit error (and have a 1% chance of having 100 errors, of course). In the case of a rebuilding 10 TB array (only a couple 3 or 4 TB drives) using RAID-5, that means that you're almost sure to have an ECC error that will prevent you from ever rebuilding properly without corruption.",1357041216

He imagines he's going to choose which parts are ignored and which aren't, or if he's more modest, he imagines somebody else which would be, by weird coincidence, agreeing with him on all counts except for some minor unimportant details.<p>The good test for such concept is to ask such person to identify most unpleasant, unattractive, disgusting political figure, that holds views absolutely abhorrent to him and see if he still supports this case if that person if put in charge of choosing which part of the Constitution to ignore and which freedoms are unnecessary to have. Somehow they never think that would happen.<p>That's why I am for limited government - I'd probably love to have government that does exactly what I want. But I know that would never happen, so I'd rather have one that does not give bad people in power ability to do too much of bad things.

4992430,comment,4991968,4992137,1,0,RyanZAG,,,"I disagree heavily - converting a game design into a working game in less than a day means that all of the real work was done by an automated tool. You can build houses the same way - an architect designs a house and then it gets duplicated into a suburb with all the houses looking nearly identical. House prices plummet and nobody wants to live there unless they can't afford better.<p>So sure, you could have a functional game in an hour off some automated process... but it's not going to be art, and it's probably not going to be fun to see the 3rd game come off that tool, let alone the 300th.<p>Webcomics work because there is no automation. You start with a blank page and you create everything on that page by hand directly from your imagination. Games that do the same (unique indie and older games, such as minecraft or king's quest) are always far far better than some auto generated box2d jumping game that are all the rage these days.

I'm not 100% sure but while Go has much better cross-compiling story than others, I believe net/http does uses OS's C library and therefore cannot be cross-compiled that easily.<p>Also, you have to copy the assets (templates and such) and if you're deploying a new version of a web app, you don't just overwrite the binary. My script makes sure that if something goes wrong (i.e. a new version doesn't work or has a bug), it's easy for me to revert to previous version.<p>That being said, none of that implies that Go makes deployment harder (or easier, for that matter) than deploying code in other languages would be.

It's in audio form for free here:<p><a href=""https://mises.org/media.aspx?action=category&ID=87"" rel=""nofollow"">https://mises.org/media.aspx?action=category&ID=87</a><p>Chapter 12. The Public Sector, III: Police, Law, and the Courts is particularly impressive.<p>EDIT: Here is Rothbard's amusing argument against utilitarianism:<p>""Let us consider a stark example: Suppose a society which\nfervently considers all redheads to be agents of the Devil and therefore to be executed whenever found. Let us further\nassume that only a small number of redheads exist in any generationso few as to be statistically insignificant. The utilitarian-libertarian might well reason: While the murder of isolated redheads is deplorable, the executions are small in number; the vast majority of the public, as non-redheads,achieves enormous psychic satisfaction from the public execution of redheads. The social cost is negligible, the social, psychic benefit to the rest of society is great; therefore, it is right and proper for society to execute the redheads. The natural-rights libertarian, overwhelmingly concerned as he is for the\njustice of the act, will react in horror and staunchly and\nunequivocally oppose the executions as totally unjustified\nmurder and aggression upon non-aggressive persons. The consequence of stopping the murders  depriving the bulk of society of great psychic pleasure  would not influence such a libertarian, the absolutist libertarian, in the slightest.  Dedicated to justice and to logical consistency, the natural-rights libertarian cheerfully admits to being doctrinaire, to being, in short, an unabashed follower of his own doctrines.""",1357040482

409029,comment,408784,408784,0,0,russell,,,"A couple of decades ago, a couple of us wrote a word processor.  We thought a lot about the issues of novices and usability and came to the conclusion that users are novices for only a short time and spend most of their time as intermediates.  True power users are few.  So basic operations should be intuitive even if not strictly consistent. Everything else should be easily discoverable. Really esoteric things could be left to the manual, but still discoverable.<p>A novice friendly interface should not impede an experienced user, and there should not be experience based modes.  You don't see much of these days.  MS Word is an example of a crappy interface.  Some non-esoteric functions are hidden away in non-discoverable corners and it does magical things as a default.  Eclipse is another program with a crappy interface, because of different modes and views.  I have finally accommodated my self because it eases the intense pain of Java programming, but on the whole I would rather use UltraEdit.<p>Of course none of this applies to emacs users.  They are are a secret society unto, themselves, kind of like the Masons.",1230144727

409023,comment,408767,408938,0,0,randomwalker,,,"I'm from the same part of India that this girl is. This kind of crap is very common there. The kids who do this are not necessarily intelligent, they usually just crammed for years. Nor do they have a say in the matter. Everything is orchestrated by the parents. It's like a dog show -- the parents compete using their kids. Needless to say, the kid's childhood and normal development are completely derailed (I've seen it in person). The parents aren't evil; it's just a facet of the hyper-competitive society. The best way to describe it is that it's India's version of the contest in Little Miss Sunshine.<p>The negative comments here don't come close to capturing how messed up this is.",1230144487

That being said, I don't agree that roping off functionaltiy is the best way for advanced text editors to lower the learning curve.  Contextual hints are a better way to introduce shortcuts for those sort of apps.<p>I also disagree that HN's downvoting feature is an example of  progressive learning.  It's more about controlling trolls and setting expectations in the community.  You have to earn your keep before you can negatively affect change.

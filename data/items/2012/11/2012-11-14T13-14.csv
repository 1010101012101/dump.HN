If the goal is to find useful software for cheap to solve your problem, then open-source generally falls flat. This from a guy who's been looking for open solutions for decades (me).<p>Open software is often narrow in scope, tied to some preconceived notion of how its going to be used, and spotty in implementation. E.g. Gimp, which is useful for some but useless to me - I have GB of layered images that won't import into GIMP except as flattened bitmaps - I'll need to continue editing my layers in future.  I could write my own image importer for GIMP, but hey! paying for a PS license is cheaper and faster.<p>Other examples: file format interpreting libraries. I've used them lots. Each time I have to untangle the actual code that interprets formats, from the cruft around it that assumes I'm going to run a command-line script, or link with a certain runtime, or have a dialog-based interface, or whatever was the itch somebody scratched when they created the code.<p>If its in nobodies best interest to separate the actual IP from the scaffolding that surrounds it, then Open Source is delegated to hobby projects by people with time to burn.",1352901184

4783266,comment,4782755,4782755,2,0,kevingadd,,,"Function inlining is absolutely automatic in modern JS runtimes. Of course, that doesn't mean the functions you want inlined will get inlined, so it can still occasionally pay off to do it by hand - but make sure you test to see if the results are actually better. Sometimes the runtime will decide not to inline a function for a good reason. For example, if the function you're calling has something wrong with it that deoptimizes it in the JS runtime, inlining that function will successfully deoptimize the outer function. Now more of your code is running slowly.<p>EDIT: If you're micro-optimizing, why not cache '((hitColor >> 24) & 0xFF)' in a local at the top of the function instead of computing it every iteration? Loop invariant code motion might hoist it for you, but I don't know why you wouldn't do that by hand.<p>Also, wrapping your integer arithmetic in ( ) | 0 may improve its performance in Firefox and some other browsers because it allows the JIT to omit overflow checks.

You can do this with function calls even in C.<p>2) You can hide implementations using opaque types + accessor functions.  OCaml has some pretty neat typing constructs that allow partial type hiding as well.  You can even do this in C with incomplete types.<p>3) Subtyping is provided at the module level by OCaml's module interfaces, at the opaque type level by Haskell and Mercury's type classes, and at the transparent type level by OCaml's polymorphic variants and functional objects.<p>4) Code composition / programming in the large is provided by OCaml's module functor system or Scheme's unit system.  You can even do this in C at the linker level.<p>5) Run-time dynamic dispatch is a feature that's rarely actually needed in practice.  (Compile-time dynamic dispatch is usually sufficient; that's provided by Haskell's type classes or OCaml's module functors.)  Nonetheless OCaml provides RTTD -- <i>with</i> multiple dispatch -- through functional objects, Mercury provides the same through a combination of type classes + existential types.

4783261,comment,4781894,4781894,3,0,delinka,,,"Well, if you want ""fundamental particles of computing,"" have some machine code. Assembly is a bit more tolerable, but directly correlates to machine code, so sure, use that. The thing is, the CPU is ""imperative"" - it's a machine whose state changes according to instructions provided to it. <i>Everything</i> else is abstraction. Abstraction attempts to reduce the amount of stuff the programmer needs to think about all at once (i.e. 'complexity.') A nice procedural language lets you more easily reuse code by referring to procedures which, in turn, are executed sequentially. OOP lets you group functionality with conceptual objects. Every bit of code you write is executed sequentially by a CPU core. So what abstraction works best for you?<p>In some cases, it's not about what works well for the programmer. I'm currently an OS X and iOS developer and I see problems in the Cocoa APIs with an overabundance of OOP. The simplest of iOS apps gets a view, a view controller, an app delegate (which often gets used as an app controller), etc ad nauseum. Now, I come along and look at the code and just want to know how the thing does what it does, but the functionality is spread across dozens of classes and to follow along I actually have to run the app to see that the entry point to the functionality is really -touchesBegan on some deep class... it's obnoxious. What's worse is the design of Cocoa and CoreFoundation lead to many app designs that have magical entry points unless you have more deep knowledge than you ever thought you might. I get that this is an attempt by Apple at keeping the developer more productive by writing less code, but I don't think that idea is being implemented as well as it could be.",1352900983

Instead of having 23 poorly-understood and often badly implemented design patterns, functional programming has two design patterns: Noun and Verb.

I'm glossing over that for now.)</i><p>Then I would have to ask how is that different than OO other than the straw man at the beginning.  It has Nouns and Verbs, sure data is default mutable instead of immutable but immutable is certainly an option.  OO typically calls their verbs methods instead of functions but referential transparency is a good thing on the OO side of the fence too.

Whilst I'm not saying women don't have this experience too, I don't think it's <i>exactly</i> the same, and I also don't know if a lot of ""normal"" people appreciate just how devastating it can be.<p>See one thing I'd like to say is that whilst the situation is bad for everyone, the minority status of girls in gaming (at least in the early 2000s) meant as a teenage boy, it felt like they had a certain privilege. So what I'll do is try and illustrate my feelings as they used to be in the hope of providing a better understanding of it all.<p>This is how I felt as a kid.<p>Here me out, as I'm just trying to explain people's attitudes. As a nerdy, bad at socialising, rejected by anyone (due to being creepy/awkward/unconfident/ashamed) guy growing up, you find a sanctum, a cave, full of people like you, where instead of like at school where people are ""ranked"" on their social ability, they are instead ranked on their gaming ability, knowledge, ability to stick at a shitty internet argument, whatever. Either way, it feels like your world where you're free of the bullshit that comes with being a nerdy teenage boy. Free from the bullying, the failure, the powerlessness. The only issue is that you are one of a giant mass of people - it's extremely hard to discern who you are simply because everyone is pretty much like you - slightly sick sense of humour, loving LAN parties, wearing nerdy t-shirts. As a guy you're kind of part of a big mass and you feel like there is no way to discern yourself, or get attention (and attention is important if you lack a normal amount of it).<p>So then, a girl comes along. Everyone fawns over them, gives them huge amounts of attention, invites them to everything - say you spent months trying to befriend people enough to get invited to the coolest LANs or OPed on the most popular IRC channels. A pretty girl in nerd circles was seemingly such a rarity that they'd have this shit given to them instantly, lavished with attention (and as we can see now, not necessarily the good kind). It was even worse if they were pretty and wore ""slutty"" cosplay outfits - now you're competing for the attention of the girl again and it's just like school and that horrible place we abandoned. So you get jealous, bitter, and resentful. You get even more jealous, bitter, and resentful when said girls make blog posts about how bad they've got it, when they are getting all the attention and advantages you've dreamed about since you can remember, but all they have to do is put up with a little creepiness? How dare they. You try to talk to them, a half assed flirt (because you don't really get the chance to talk to girls) and are shot down as being creepy and only into girls for sex - not true - you sometimes feel the deepest connection you've ever had for someone because they have bridged into your world and might just be the one.

A button and interface designed for the mini might look goofy on the larger device; an interface designed for the larger iPad might be entirely unusable on the Mini. And it's reasonable for designers to want to solve that problem.<p>Furthermore, your example is anecdotal and fairly meaningless. I've got a 15"" screen that's 2880x1800, so what of it? I definitely don't run it at native resolutionit's scaled 2x, or 1.5x down. And it Just Works because there are APIs for native applications and in CSS that expose the pixel density so that developers can deal with it gracefully. Why not do the same for other devices which are also supposed to be high resolutionand more importantlyresolution independent?<p>The truth is, all of these devices have different pixel densities, and we're supposed to be moving in a resolution-independent direction, such that the physical size of the device and the number of pixels on its screen are completely arbitrary and controllable variables. Especially on mobile, interfaces depend on physical size, not on resolution; the size of a the main input mechanism does not depend on screen resolution or device sizeit is static. It is a finger. We should be able to control the UI correctly instead of kludging around the problem.<p>This idea that you shouldn't need to design apps correctly is simply an excuse for the lack of means to do so.

The purchase I talked about exposed me to my purchase price in risk. In reality the risk was less since _everyone_ for every stock purchase should always set trailing stops to limit risk. In my theoretical trade of purchasing a put option on GOOG you are exposed to a maximum of you outlay in risk ( no ballooning risk ) and if like you should you set a trailing stop you further limit your risk to a small subset of the initial outlay.<p>Also to further prove that your wrong. The SEC has rules in place requiring that investors are not allowed to have to mush risk in their portfolio. Had you done what you jsut claimed and did a naked short on GOOG with no protection you would have been required to either pony up a large cash reserve ( protecting your broker from the liability ). Most responsible brokerages won't even allow your trade to go through unless again you have a large enough portfolio to absorb any reasonable risk.<p>This by the way is only using options for speculation.

My wife has the 16 and I have the 32, figuring we'd never max out the memory in either case. Boy, were we wrong. She can't update more than a few apps at a time. I'm down to the last few GBs and even after purging videos and photos. Music isn't even a problem because we have iTunes Match so it purges things regularly.<p>The size of the retina apps is just insane. I compiled my first app (a small music app) around the time the 3GS came out and it was only 1MB. Now, even a simple game clocks in at 30MB.",1352898082

    Everything else is an experiment, and it will come back
    to you sooner or later. Why? think cross compilation, installation/

The intrinsic value of options is almost always an order of magnitude less than what you pay for it (at the money - most liquid). Being worth 10% what you pay for something is not marketable value.",1352898003

We won&#x27;t know what the impacts of a decline in research funding will be, but there&#x27;s only one way to find out! Will it be another Dark Age? Or will it be Galt&#x27;s Gluch? Stay tuned!<p>Inspected rationally, this sort of national gamble is the definition of insanity. It wasn&#x27;t &quot;American Exceptionalism&quot; that made the U.S.A what it is, but an unprecedented leve of concerted investment by the state into science and technology over the past century.<p>Let&#x27;s see where this grand experiment leads us.<p>Relevant HN post from earlier, where I elaborate on this issue further:<p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7321660"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7321660</a>",1393898372

Since they don&#x27;t support user-only packages, of course reverting an install isn&#x27;t going to happen.<p>If you&#x27;ve installed it yourself, `rm -rf $HOME/opt/$pkgname`.<p>> The other very serious issue is that most package builds are not deterministic.<p>Deterministic builds are hard.<p>> be able to create the exact same package on different architectures and cross-check that we&#x27;ve got the same results<p>Unless you&#x27;re cross-compiling, different architectures by definition nets you different builds. Even within an architecture, differences in feature sets (take advantage of Intel&#x27;s shiniest instruction?) and compile time options (use this library?), where to install, etc. cause the number of possible build combinations to multiply quickly. Binary distros like Debian have it a bit easier, as they usually distribute a lowest-common-denominator binary with all features, but some distributions (I&#x27;m a Gentoo user) let you tune the system more.<p>Even <i>if</i> you had all the things you name, you still have to trust whomever is packaging your software.

7337941,comment,7336872,7337715,6,0,dlgeek,,,"First let me explain the relationship between the first and second values.<p>For authentcation, passphrases are used because they&#x27;re a lot easier for humans to remember than 256 bit hex strings. The WPA2 standard (IEEE 802.11i) defines the passphrase to PSK derivation as &quot;PSK = PBKDF2(PassPhrase, ssid, ssidLength, 4096, 256)&quot;  (PBKDF2 is a hashing-based key derivation function, in this case using SHA1).<p>So, this takes us from a password to a key. Now how do we auth to the router?<p>In WPA2, there&#x27;s a master-key (known as the &quot;pairwise master key&quot; or PMK) which is known by both the client and the access point. This key (the PMK) is then used in a 4-way hand-shake and key negotiation that allows each party to establish that the other has knowledge of the key. This key is either handled via a complex authorization mechanism like radius (WPA-EPA) or is simply shared between all the parties (WPA-PSK). In this case, the pre-shared key (&quot;PSK&quot;) that we derived above is used directly as the PMK to complete the 4-way handshake.",1393897391

Perhaps many different digital worlds. I mean, let&#x27;s turn the question perhaps into one that is ontologically similar: What about multiverses? Are <i>you</i> your double at some nearby possible world? Admitting that you are, does that &quot;destroy&quot; you at this world? Can a <i>decision</i> do this? Can a decision do the opposite, that is preserve your &quot;you&quot;-ness, or let&#x27;s call it <i>existential integrity</i>?<p>I think the true philosophy of &quot;Her&quot; is Henry Miller&#x27;s assertion that<p><pre><code>    Words are loneliness.\n</code></pre>\nBut there isn&#x27;t any metaphysic here that re-inforces the divide between mind and body — it is a philosophy of <i>how we feel</i> about the <i>supposed</i> bifurcation of reality (into easily digestable categories like &quot;the physical&quot; and &quot;the mental&quot;). How we <i>feel</i> about Mind-Body dualism&#x27;s <i>possible truth</i> is not a justification for its truth. That&#x27;s pragmatism. Who cares about boring old pragmatism? Or at least let us admit that this is only <i>one</i> viewpoint on the whole debate, and it isn&#x27;t a very compelling one.<p>I absolutely do believe that &quot;uploading one&#x27;s mind&quot; is possible — but if we treat &quot;copy&quot; just as we do today, we need to be thorough-going. When I copy a file to a new OS, that new OS either understands it or it does not, runs a program by default or it does not. But now wait — we&#x27;re talking about a file here — a file. All of the existential questions we&#x27;re asking, we&#x27;re basing on the notion of &quot;copy&quot; as it relates to files. Why should we suppose that we even know what we&#x27;re talking about, using this clearly antequated grammar? I&#x27;m not a file! (Put another way: Are files ever really &quot;destroyed&quot;? — No! Their &quot;space&quot; is made &quot;available&quot; on the disk. So following your metaphor, if I&#x27;m &quot;destroyed&quot; it&#x27;s merely that the space I take up is made available to something else — which presupposes that everything once maintaining that space is accident, it&#x27;s all accidental properties of the World). So I&#x27;ll say here: forget that &quot;categorical divide&quot; which is just another fashion of dualism — humans <i>can</i> extend their consciousness to digital worlds.<p>Chalmers et al. are talking about embodied cognition — we&#x27;re all talking about extending our consciousness into the world through augmented reality. This talk of &quot;copy-destroy&quot; isn&#x27;t using the same grammar of philosophical research. We&#x27;re talking about &quot;me&quot; looking at &quot;me&quot; sans mirrors. Could I have 7 eyeballs? Possibly! Is my neural system plastic enough to manage multiple memories and personality — already demonstrated in mental illness cases!<p>Can <i>I</i> be <i>extended</i>? <i>That</i> is the relevant question — not &quot;can I be copied&quot;? &quot;Copy&quot; is such a barbaric nonterm here.<p>There shouldn&#x27;t <i>be</i> such a thing as <i>copying one&#x27;s mind</i> — in order to upload a mind, the project is far more complex than talk about the neural substrate of one person — we need to be talking about Operating Universes. I&#x27;m afraid this discussion, as it is currently constructed, is a false-start, a non-starter — a category mistake.<p>[0]: <a href=""http://quantum-ethics.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://quantum-ethics.org/</a>",1393896666

Also, all of your graduate students and postdocs must be paid out of your grants (if they don&#x27;t have their own money); the universities won&#x27;t pay them to do research in your lab, though they will happily claim the IP they generate.",1393896477

I know lots of people who enjoy math, and found that joy in college or later, but found the educational experience of K-12 so abysmal and torturous that they completely swore off even pursuing fields with heavy Math components. There are lots of artists, musicians, writers and historians who would probably be great Mathematicians, Physicists and Scientists were it not for the piss poor job we do indoctrinating kids into math.<p>It&#x27;s not just that students fail to learn mathematics, it&#x27;s that the pedagogical experience is so negative that they swear off ever even trying. And IMHO, a very big part of that is the (to the student) endlessly pointless jargon filled inapplicable overly rigorous and formal mess that is Math education today.<p>I&#x27;ve sat in the audience on some very heated round tables about promoting STEM education in my region and I&#x27;ve come away convinced that getting more people into STEM is critical to long-term economic success, but students are not only <i>not</i> drawn into STEM, they&#x27;re actively driven away from it by the pedagogical approach of what amounts to a single class every year. Students love science classes and science labs, they love shop class and learning engineering, they love computers and everything else to do with STEM <i>except</i> for the K-12 Mathematics education. And that loses them, it simply drives them away from all of these great (and often lucrative) fields.<p>More importantly, I think fields which are not traditionally Math focused, could benefit greatly from a better general Math education. Read a social sciences academic paper and see what I mean for a quick example.<p>> If you try to teach a little kid the power rule right off the bat, they will both be turned off of math (because it&#x27;s just pushing x around for no clear reason) and have learned absolutely nothing of the important bits of calculus.<p>I want to agree particularly with this, &quot;it&#x27;s just pushing x around for no clear reason&quot;. The fundamental problem with learning Mathematics in K-12 is applicability. Beyond arithmetic, students have almost zero examples of why they should bother learning anything else. <i>Most</i> of the population gets by just fine without anything more complex than arithmetic and figuring out percentages (and even then that&#x27;s a stretch).<p>When students go to their parents to seek guidance, their parents <i>also</i> don&#x27;t have any idea why they have to learn all this stuff. <i>They</i> certainly don&#x27;t need it in their day jobs and can&#x27;t provide a hint as to why it&#x27;s important other than the student needs to study it for the grades.<p>And to be honest, even if their parents <i>do</i> use Mathematics in their work and can provide examples, it&#x27;s likely that the student&#x27;s ability to relate to that work is very limited. The reinforcement that all this time spent learning Math is pointless is much stronger than the reinforcement that it&#x27;s important or useful. Getting a kid to crank through 20 or 30 algebra problems is <i>much</i> harder than say, a 5 paragraph essay for English class because the entire time they&#x27;re doing this they&#x27;re saying to themselves &quot;why am I doing this? Math is useless! At least learning to write a little has some kind of use!&quot;<p>But children will play &quot;pointless&quot; games for hours and hours and hours - and not even ones they&#x27;re especially having fun with, just ones that hold their interest (if you&#x27;ve ever watched a 9 year old vent frustration at their Xbox you&#x27;ll know what I mean). If we can turn Mathematics education into a kind of &quot;game&quot;, then fill in the details and formal bits as they age, they&#x27;ll at least be able to relate to it even if they don&#x27;t understand the application or relevancy.<p>And the truth is, once you get to Calculus and get it, it&#x27;s actually pretty fun and pretty easy. That&#x27;s a high enough discipline for most STEM jobs and I firmly believe that every K-12 student should be able to do what we call &quot;college level&quot; Calculus by the 10th grade. So why not try to capture the things that make Mathematics at that level fun and easy, and I think that&#x27;s the symbolic manipulation, even if it is hard to establish relevancy, and get them used to doing it from a very early age. Kids can move blocks around and stack them before they can walk, why can&#x27;t the blocks be bits of equations? And why can&#x27;t moving the blocks have little game-like rules they can learn?",1393895220

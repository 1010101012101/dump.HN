Your doing a potentially a ton of work with a very innocent function call, with possible side-effects. At least the 'pass a reference by value' behaves the same way EVERY time.<p>For example, in C++:<p>myobj a;
somefunction(a);<p>That copy constructor might trigger a database hit to create a new object if myobj was some sort of ORM. It might call 23 other constructors to fully complete it's deep copy. Who knows, as it all happens rather implicitly. In python, that would look like:<p>a = myobj()
somefunction(a)<p>def somefunction(p):
   p = copy.deepcopy(p)<p>In that version I'm now implicitly providing that copy. In your multi-threaded example this is still better, as I get the best of both worlds. Ya, I might lose a bit of convenience... but that explictness is worth the trade-off IMHO.",1260174471

There's more to most variables than a mean and a standard deviation -- so I don't know why people seem to always think that you can restrict a discussion of intelligence to such concepts.<p>One thing that is actually correct is that there's more variation in gene expression between men and women. On of the reasons for this is because, chromosomally, women have two X chromosomes, which pair up, and then randomly one or another turns off. These means that the gene expression is mixed between both parents.<p>On the other hand, the Y chromosome is largely only effective at turning off gene expression. You can see how there's less redundancy here.<p>But intelligence isn't a gene. Researchers have, since the time of Dalton, tried to find a simple, biological basis for genius. You know, memory capacity, reaction times, brain size, brain structure convolution, etc. They haven't found anything -- literally everything has turned out to be a false start, even brain size, which, has been shown, within families does not even predict g.<p>In the mid ranges, there are greater standard deviations, yes. But every single normed test is normed on a sample on the order of 1000. They're designed for regular people. The designer of the Weschler has adamantly opposed the use of IQ tests for anything other than clinical settings, for this reason. It's just no good at drawing conclusions on the extremes of ability.<p>A better guide might be actual performance. The IOI this year had more girls than ever before -- 11. That's nearly 300% more than last year, where they had 4, and one medal. They are:<p>Emina Bukva (Bosnia and Herzegovina) Constanza Contreras (Chile) Anna Currel (Spain) Romina Huenchunao (Chile) Vaiva Imbrasaite (Lithuania) Taksapaun Kittiakrastien (Thailand) [Silver] Sepideh Mahabadi (Iran) [Gold!] Radwa Metwali (Egypt) Katie O'Mahony (Ireland) Phitchaya Phothilimthana (Thailand) [Silver] Ye Wang (USA) [Silver]<p>Sepideh Mahabadi had one of the best performances of anyone. If you're familiar with IOI scoring, only the top 1/12 are to get golds, and 2/12 to get silvers, thus 1 gold and 3 silvers out of 11 implies that they did at least as good as the boys, and in fact somewhat better.<p>Were the 'standard deviation' explanation correct they should have, instead, had 0.4 girls earning maybe 0.01 medals. It just doesn't work. Psychometrics are a non-science.""",1260174097

980909,comment,979258,980860,0,0,tomneo,,,"> ""first-class functions require references in Perl 5""
yes thats what i meant. to put it simply.
perl4 did not have lexical variables, first class functions, proper syntax for nested data structures.
larry said let there be references. its one big hammer to solve all problems.<p>i think perl6 is using a different appoach based on  laziness for nested data structures. there are always strings and do blocks which assign and return globs with randomised but unique name(gensym but perls gensym is returns a GLOB reference so you have to write ur own).<p>reference context == continuation right ??
in sub bar { ... $foo = sub { .... } ... return \$foo},
i think \$foo also captures the lexpad of bar using a single reference to $foos internals. thats all.<p>otherwise i think one would need continuations like in ruby or scheme or perl6.",1260173983

If you explain it away with something factually incorrect about pass-by-reference, your doing a real disservice to whomever you are teaching.<p>After all, the issue here has nothing to do with parameter passing and everything to do with object design. It's important to understand that tuples are truly immutable and what the implications of that is.<p>Misuse of tuples and lists are one of the biggest problems I see in novice (and often not so novice) python code. How often do you see someone copying tuples (often inadvertently) when list semantics are far more efficient? That stems from a fundamental misunderstanding of immutability, something that might stem from not understanding how parameters are truly passed in the language.",1260173981

As the article points out, this stuff really does matter.<p>There are classes of problems that these type of true reference semantics can be quite helpful. In C/C++ the technique is largely used in contexts where you want to return multiple values from a function, as there is no native support for dynamic tuples. Such is the way of statically typed languages.<p>There are also cases where this type of reference to a pointer magic can really improve the efficiency of the algorithm.<p>True reference passing is a tool.

So I am gonna keep trying. and then more.<p>""That requires him to mind you and cater to your lifestyle"", when I said that my vegetarianism springs not from conscious thought, you should understand that its no longer a choice for me. Now if this guy stands for his food, I will show you an architect who thinks large obvious parking spaces with blue paint smeared on them makes his beautiful beautiful building look bad. Would you consider going back on disability laws?<p>Now I am not going to stand and say this is how all vegetarians are. But the fact that I exist and many many more like me, should make you reconsider.<p>Can't passion for your food, and compassion for a fellow human being co-exist?",1217289438

259820,comment,259170,259329,0,0,reitzensteinm,,,"I don't think that there would be any additional advantage to doing that under the model Cuban is proposing. Business owners would still pay tax on their personal income. The actual dollar amount of tax paid by a one person company that pays all profits to its owner/employee would be the same with or without small business taxes, since the business always has a profit of 0.<p>Business owners may prefer contractors for various reasons still, but this wouldn't add to it. Did business owners in Romania also get a break on the money paid out from the small business as personal income?",1217289012

That would also make the 'people in the news' section move up the page nicely.<p>It may also be more interesting if you could add images to the article listing.<p>Good work, and good luck.",1217288862

The smaller the manufacturer, the more they care about your business. It would seem like the 2nd is the one you want, but it is not, go with the large one. Look for a CM with ""new product introduction"" expertise, and their experience and size will pay great dividends.",1217288462

This means that the ranking system has lead to the rating system being used strategically.<p>The implications of this for approval voting would be an interesting corollary.

Having been in the military and seen what real fucked-up circumstances are like in other countries, I much prefer what we have in the States over anything else.<p>And have you considered that the bickering, the analysis, the corruption, the this and that is part of the evolution of our republic and culture? That the introspection is required and Reddit being the lens is only one part of that? The only other thing that can make you feel better, albeit still hollow, is voting. Aside from that all you have left is to be personally involved in politics. I dropped what I was doing and bought a ticket to join the Ron Paul protest and rally. It made me feel better.",1217287504

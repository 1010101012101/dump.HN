8217513,comment,8216865,8217396,4,0,rahimiali,,,"Avoiding the need for feature engineering is one purported advantage of deep learning. The reality is that shallow methods also work on raw data. All you need a large data set and a model whose capacity can grow with the size of the dataset (kernel methods, random features, boosting, even polynomials).<p>Another purported advantage of deep nets is that they require less data to train. The hope is that hierarchical representations encode knowledge more efficiently than shallow ones. This is motivated by biology and by theoretical bounds on the size of circuits for representing boolean functions. But empirical evidence on real world data does not support this hope. One can obtain just as good a predictor as any deep net by training a shallow network with a comparable number of parameters (one recent example is &quot;Kernel Methods Match Deep Neural Networks on TIMIT&quot;).<p>The third purported advantage is the mid layers of deep networks can be repurposed from one application to another. There a few convincing examples of this (&quot;Analyzing the Performance of Multilayer Neural Networks for Object Recognition&quot; is one example). That&#x27;s likely a win over shallow networks because shallow networks have no intermediate representations to speak of.<p>My figure of merit for any supervised learning technique is a monotonic function of<p><pre><code>  1) test error of the final model\n  2) time to evaluate on a test sample\n  3) time to train\n  4) human effort to train\n</code></pre>\nFor deep nets, every improvement in 1-2 has come with terrible deterioration in 3-4. Furthermore, shallow nets still do better than deep nets in all four respects. Which, is exactly why deep networks interest me. I&#x27;m a sucker for the underdog.",1408848456
8217512,comment,8216865,8217236,5,0,TeodolfoM,,,"A link to a textbook draft from prominent ML researchers specializing in deep learning that is shockingly also about deep learning is not an example of hype. Yoshua Bengio has been working on neural nets for years and years and he leads the only one of the big three deep learning labs to not have a lot of commercial entanglements. I agree there seems to be some extra attention for deep learning recently. So who is hyping this stuff?  Not the people in the big three (Toronto, NYU, Montreal) deep learning labs. They are just doing what they have always done, work on neural nets and solve problems and write papers (and in this case a textbook).<p>Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Baidu, and to a lesser extent IBM, have all made large commitments to using deep learning methods. Why? Because they solve some really hard problems particularly well. Are they hyping deep learning? Not as such. They are trying to bring attention to their products. Rick Rashid had a presentation that mentioned deep learning and some of the other firms have mentioned that they use deep learning in certain products (e.g. google voice search) but they don&#x27;t really seem to be hyping the methods or techniques so much as their own particular successes with them. So who is hyping deep learning?<p>Deep learning techniques solve a lot of important problems and can almost certainly be applied to many more. But &quot;deep learning&quot; isn&#x27;t a single technique, it is an attitude and approach to machine learning. So the reason you are hearing more about it is because big industry players are using it and some people in academia are getting a bit more traction in the broader ML community with the ideas they have been pushing, refining, and improving for years.<p>Shitty tech journalists and overoptimistic amateur &quot;data science&quot; clowns in the startup community that think these ideas are some sort of panacea are the people overhyping it.",1408848442

8217509,comment,8216958,8216958,1,0,jasonisalive,,,"Articles like this (ignoring the insulting, historically-naive comparison) aren&#x27;t news. If you have even a weak understanding of economic theory, it&#x27;s clear that countries like Britain, France and the USA are all clinging to self-destructive public policies - driven by popular demand, mind you, not corporate interference. When the &quot;developed world&quot; becomes serious about competing economically with China (distinct from militaristic aggression), it will be plain to see. The following of the West&#x27;s sacred cows will begin to fall:<p>1) Knowing better/attempting to overrule the free market (minimum wages, minimum labour conditions, centralised permits to sell goods such as drugs, medical services, legal services)<p>2) Giving &quot;something for nothing&quot; (subsidised/free education, subsidised/free healthcare, subsidised/free pensions/saving schemes.<p>Currently anyone who dares to question these aspects of Western economies is immediately eviscerated by the crowd. The culture of entitlement is very strong. Soon enough, however, with the last of the props that sustained these sick economies thus far failing (militarism, centralised currency control, controls on global mobility, global cultural allure), getting rid of them will be hailed as bold new thinking.",1408848316

If you do want to avoid low level code then you&#x27;ll prefer to approach with a single language such as Julia or Java, but this means trading the bare-to-the-metal performance for having a VM and JIT between the code and the machine.<p>The argument of preferring writing C code to Cython code is moot because you have the choice of writing code in Cython or using it to wrap existing C code. While the second option allows you to write in C as you say you&#x27;d prefer, the first options offers seamless integration of C code and manipulation of Python datastructures, so there is an advantage to using Cython not just for wrappers but also for code.<p>I&#x27;m a bit at a loss as to why you would claim I gave a rosy picture, or what this &quot;self cheering&quot; is about (note that my use of &quot;ideal&quot; was part of a conditional).

The experiences of both writing and reading are often in a different realm altogether than those of speaking and listening face to face -- one is not a watered down version of the other.  They have different qualities.<p>And even in the case of scientific and mathematical exposition, where your statement is more often true, there are many exceptions.  For example, I think of professors I&#x27;ve had who could write lucidly but were poor teachers, both in the classroom and in office hours.  Either their social skills stood in the way of their communication, or their verbal skills were not as good as their written ones.

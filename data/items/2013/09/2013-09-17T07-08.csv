There is absolutely nothing civil in this comment.<p>While I completely disagree with the grandparent comment, I understand that that&#x27;s his/her opinion, nothing more. What Hickey talks about may seem obvious, but only in hindsight, at least to me. It seems that most of the commenters in this thread feel the same way. However, I can accept that there are people, like Zerr, who would find Hickey&#x27;s talks to be rather boring stuff, since they are already well aware of everything he talks about.

I’ll put down a down payment of $10k.” You’ll be laughed right out of there.&quot;<p>Actually, pretty much any brokerage will allow you to purchase with &quot;25% down&quot; on a margin account. It is extremely risky as at that point, any drop will force a sale and a 25% drop would completely wipe out your capital and leave you with nothing. It&#x27;s certainly not difficult to borrow money to purchase equities.<p>> This is because &quot;owning a home&quot; has a sentimental value attached to it by policy makers<p>While it&#x27;s true policy makers unnecessarily encourage home ownership and related credit, that is not primary reason credit is more widely available for real estate. Equities are extremely risky - companies can and do go bankrupt overnight, wiping out shareholders.<p>Real estate, particularly expensive real estate, always retains some value and can always recover in value. Real estate very rarely collapses into worthlessness, whereas almost all equities eventually will.<p>>  the size of your return is related to the risk you are taking on<p>Not true. Markets are not that efficient, and information, understanding, and wisdom are not equal, and credit and cash availability varies widely for different people and assets. Finding a good investment opportunity, by definition, is finding an investment with lower risk and higher return. Purchasing real estate in 2008 was low risk, high return. This was a market distortion caused by credit contraction and irrational panic. In addition, real estate has higher return because it requires work and adding value by maintaining buildings, finding and managing tenants, etc - these are not related to risk/return.<p>Anyway, sorry - this is just too much information not to challenge.",1379404160

6398079,comment,6396074,6397345,1,0,peterwwillis,,,"<i>Containers can be 100% accurately cloned so significant testing can be performed before deployment.</i><p>This has been the catch-22 i&#x27;ve had problems explaining, so bear with me here. Your docker container and my cfengine change are <i>exactly the same thing</i> in terms of testing and guarantees of sameness.<p>So, you have a Docker, and you hand-built it to an exact specification, and made an image that does a specific thing. You ship that image to 1000 nodes and it works &quot;exactly the same&quot; across all of them.<p>So, I have Cfengine, and I hand-configured it to an exact specification of operations, and made a config file that does a specific thing. I ship that config to 1000 nodes and it works <i>exactly the same</i> across all of them.<p>Why did they both end up giving me exactly what I expected? Because I controlled the input and the structure of the files to exactly my specifications, and nothing changed in those files once it was copied to the nodes, so they worked exactly as I expected. We can also assume I had no other dependencies for either to work.<p>(The Cfengine dependencies were the cfengine binary, which we can ensure is the same version across all hosts pretty easily. The Docker version, and the whole &quot;ecosystem&quot; of docker tools, is similar to enforce, though the much wider range of dependencies will make it <i>much harder</i> to support the same ones on all platforms, which is where we have to start using a unified platform, which is where the whole &quot;run it anywhere on anything&quot; bullshit becomes painfully unrealistic)<p>Uh-oh, here comes trouble! A developer comes over and wants 10 of the 1000 nodes to work a little differently. OK, we make a config file that Docker will read to configure the service a little different. Separately, we can make Cfengine read a similar config file that tells it how to configure the node differently. We ship the config file off to the 10 nodes, and Docker/Cfengine reads it in and changes its operations.<p>All of a sudden we have unexpected behavior due to the new instructions in the config file. One hundredth of our hosts are doing something different and we have to now account for that in anything else that happens in the future. (That is not some drawback of some technology, btw; that is called &quot;I have a real network where things work differently across it&quot;).<p>The practical differences between these two is that the Cfengine change can be tested and applied quicker than a Docker, it doesn&#x27;t force you to choose how to update your application (&quot;am I updating the image? am I adding an image? am I changing the Dockerfile? am I changing the config? should I restart the docker or the service? do I have to reconfigure the autodetecting whatsit?&quot; etc), and instead of hiding changes in a &quot;Dockerfile&quot; which is only parsed at build time, it keeps changes forefront in a configuration parsed at run time. You can make either one work just as reliably as the other. But one is a hell of a lot clunkier to get working in all cases than the other.<p>Also, i&#x27;m comparing a configuration management tool to a chroot environment network transfer tool, so take all of this with a grain of salt.",1379403186

6398068,comment,6397540,6397540,5,0,geddski,,,"Hey everyone, I&#x27;m one of the organizers of ng-conf. We appreciate your feedback! Hopefully our genuine intent wasn&#x27;t lost in our (perhaps clumsy) wording.<p>Our only goal with this is simple: promote the cause of women in tech. We all work with extremely talented women and recognize their value in our industry. For example where I work (Domo) one of our VP&#x27;s just won the &quot;Women in Tech&quot; award, which is awesome. We just want the women in the Angular community to know that they&#x27;re appreciated, needed, and welcome at ng-conf.<p>To that end, we wanted to make sure that those interested would have a ticket available. Today we sold all our early bird tickets in less than 2 minutes. Next week we are opening up the next round of discounted tickets for the general public. We anticipate these and all other tickets will also sell out quickly. So to succeed in our goal - despite the inevitable statistics - we decided to reserve a number of these tickets for women. This way, women that wanted to attend wouldn&#x27;t have to worry about the luck of the Eventbrite draw. So the primary benefit is the guarantee (not the discount) of the ticket. We felt that was the least we could do to show our thanks and appreciation.<p>The pink lanyard does seem a bit silly out of context, we should have explained that idea better. As we&#x27;ve seen with other conferences with limited availability (JSConf, Google I/O, etc.) competition for a ticket can become intense. We didn&#x27;t want men to buy up all the women&#x27;s tickets using their significant other&#x27;s name, or the whole thing would be pointless. We figured if the lanyard was clearly for women, that would deter most abuse of the initiative.<p>We really do appreciate the feedback on our execution. Let me recap what we&#x27;re received so far:<p>- Most generally agree with the idea that getting more women out to ng-conf is a worthwhile initiative.\n- Pink lanyards was a terrible idea.\n- Some prefer to be referred to as women, not girls. That&#x27;s understandable. We took our cues from some of the organizations championing this same cause: &quot;Girl Develop It&quot;, &quot;Girl&#x27;s Who Code&quot;, &quot;Black Girls Code&quot;, &quot;Girls Write Now&quot;, etc. In our minds it was &quot;guys and girls&quot;, not &quot;boys and girls&quot;. Both are valid semantics of the word, but we hear you.<p>This has been a great learning experience, and it&#x27;s clear that we need to brainstorm this a bit more. If you have other ideas that accomplish the same goals in a less polarizing fashion we&#x27;re all ears. Thanks for the positive feedback, we appreciate it. We really want to do this right - it&#x27;s too important not to. Thanks!<p>Dave Geddes\n@geddski",1379402811

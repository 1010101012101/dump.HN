The internet multiplies the effect a thousandfold.'<p>If you've got scientific evidence to back up your claims, please link to it.  I'd like to know what the SI unit for parent/child interaction is.<p>I don't like the article much, but has anyone read the book he refers to?",1216806636

It wasn't a problem to search for London (it didn't go to Canada, at least!).<p>The map could be sized differently depending on resolution, so you don't have to scroll.<p>The genre list needs an overhaul. If you search for Ambient, it returns bands that claim to be Metal / Ambient, which is not the same! I like to find things by genre.<p>Is this primarily a nicer interface to myspace music?",1216806259

254199,comment,254021,254021,0,0,Tichy,,,"What all OS need is a simpler way to freeze things. My mom constantly calls me because the UI has changed due to accidental clicks, and my instructions don't work anymore. For example, my explanation for attaching pictures to mails (a REALLY complicated task) involves dragging them to the windows icon on the task bar, but somehow her Gnome task bar keeps losing the ""windows selector"". One accidental click and all effort has been wasted.<p>Even my own system I would like to be able to freeze. Firefox 3 seems to have gotten quite bad, for example occasionally it accidentally triggers the ""change page direction"" switch (which btw. seems like the most stupid option ever, this should be buried somewhere 100 layers deep, not top level).",1216805971

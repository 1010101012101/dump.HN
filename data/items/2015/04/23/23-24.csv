The real difficulty is eliminating the friction that exists between people in those large gatherings. Something we try really hard to accomplish, in between all the tea times we host, is create larger gatherings for the community and cities at large that welcome people in a way that gets rid of all notions that any attendee would need formalities to treat the others like the most amazing person in the room.",1429833595

Essentially they had foresight of which cards were coming out.

Said friend works in sales and I think she once mentioned to me the &quot;sell me this pen&quot; thingie.<p>And about people and institutions still living in the 19th century, I&#x27;m now reading a book on the 1830s Saint-Simon movement (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint-Simonianism"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint-Simonianism</a>) written by an academia darling, French philosopher Jacques Rancière. I don&#x27;t know how to put it in words, but to me it seems like Rancière would have preferred for the world to have stopped right then and there, i.e. in the 19th century, when bourgeois people had just taken over from the aristocracy and they could look from above at the peasants and workers that stood below them. He (Rancière) is of course trying to be sympathetic to the workers he writes about in his book, but one feels that he&#x27;s being sympathetic from outside their world, worse yet, from above their world. More than that, there&#x27;s this feeling of him mocking their (the workers&#x27;) belief in an better future and improved social relations, especially when talking about Fourierism (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourierism"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourierism</a>). It reminded me of people who not so long ago were still mocking open source.<p>And last but not least, and it pains me to say it, but I&#x27;m afraid that open data (the idea, the concept) is dead. Somehow the forces that be managed to kill it (I&#x27;m thinking Google post-2007 or so, FB since its inception, Twitter in the last couple of years, just to name the biggest).

SuperMicro sells a 2U machine with 4 full sized computers in it with 6 drives.  You can put 12 cores in that, and an AWS &#x27;ECU&#x27; core is a hyperthreaded core.  So, in the Supermicro &quot;quadnode&quot; [1] version you get 4 * 12 * 2 = 96 cores in 2U, or 48 cores per U.  An AWS computer/instance that costs $1/hour is a &quot;m2.4xlarge&quot; [2] which has 8 cores.  So you can sell 6 &quot;Computers&quot; per U with this math.<p>[1] <a href=""http://mezz.ixsystems.com/servers/families/?family=Gemini4"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mezz.ixsystems.com/servers/families/?family=Gemini4</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://www.ec2instances.info/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ec2instances.info/</a>",1429833108

9430654,comment,9428321,9430311,0,0,guardiangod,,,"I too am from UBC and did 6 terms of coop...in Waterloo (guess which company) .<p>From what I observe, their coop model is completely different from UBC&#x27;s. The 2 are completely different in nature.<p>From speaking to Waterloo students, it is obvious to me that the point of coop is to cram as much real life experience into the students in as little time as possible.  Note that I say real life experience, not work experience. Many students have to sublease, go to a new work for 4 months, move back to Waterloo, lease from another student who is going to work, go to school for another 4 months, and repeat the whole cycle. This is a very hectic schedule. If you ask me, the point of this is indeed to keep you from being grounded, and not to be complacent in your place.<p>Another real life experience you gain is you know _a lot_ of potential employers. Most students I know had at least 4 supervisors they can contact after they graduated. This creates a very interesting dynamic where many students are not that concern about future employments because they know they will get hire by someone.<p>A very interesting situation I noticed is that class knowledge are quickly put into use. For example, in the previous 4 months the students would learn basic data structures (in C++ ! Not with Java like in UBC), then the next month they have to apply what they just learned in a professional environment. I would say say that this is actually good for learning as the knowledge is fresh in these students&#x27; heads, and they have all the real programmers to help them out if they don&#x27;t understand something.<p>Of course, many students don&#x27;t care about coop and just get though the 4 months. During my time there I saw many job postings in University of Waterloo&#x27;s coop site that are plain bullshit. This is understandable though as really, no coop supervisors I talked to really expect U of W coop students to be very useful (at least not that useful with only 4 months worth of work term!)<p>Their engineering curriculum is much accelerated compared to UBC&#x27;s. Stuff that are taught in UBC 300 classes are considered 200 classes in U of Waterloo. As I set though their classes, I was pretty impressed at the students&#x27; ability to retain what they learn, with all the switching between work and school. Many UBC engineering/comp science students I know would be hard pressed to maintain their grade.<p>Most students I talked to are fine with the hectic schedule. These students knew what they were getting into when they entered. Those who don&#x27;t are washed out quickly.<p>In comparison, UBC coop seems to expect you to actually learn technical knowledge from the coop. This is a more traditional model where you spend 8 months with your head under water, then you can go back to the academia world of UBC and digest what you&#x27;ve experienced (and maybe alter your graduation goal). U of W requires its students to do this every 4 months. Continuous for 3 years. Maybe you like bioengineering? Do a 4 months coop and find out you hate it. Then try a financial engineering firm next. Don&#x27;t like it either? Well try a different engineering firm next coop term.<p>Looking back, I sort of agree that UBC coop can be of less value compare to U of W&#x27;s, but that&#x27;s only because they have different aims.<p>PS. U of W&#x27;s computer science coop _is_ optional. I only know 1 person who opts out of it, however.<p>PS2. I don&#x27;t know if you know, but U of W&#x27;s tuition is almost 2x as much as UBC. Coop is a good way to pay it off :) And many students see coop as such.<p>PS3. Thank god there&#x27;s Wilfrid Laurier University 900m away from U of W. Now that&#x27;s a party school with all the &#x27;happenings&#x27; and art students.",1429833031

Across the globe, that critical distance is now being diminished almost to nothing, as the institutions that produced Erasmus and John Milton, Einstein and Monty Python, capitulate to the hard-faced priorities of global capitalism.<p>I never looked at Oxford people with the same eyes again after reading Giordano Bruno&#x27;s works and about how the professors in there treated him.

Abbot mocked Bruno for supporting &quot;the opinion of Copernicus that the earth did go round, and the heavens did stand still; whereas in truth it was his own head which rather did run round, and his brains did not stand still&quot;,[23] and reports accusations that Bruno plagiarized Ficino&#x27;s work.<p>I&#x27;ve recently read a book by French historian Jacques Le Goff who was saying something along the lines of: &quot;the University as we know it was born around year 1,000 and flourished for the next couple of centuries, only to become more segregated and focused on itself starting with the 14th century, so much so that the Renaissance happened outside of its sphere of influence&quot;.<p>So I will keep my hopes up.

Why should Jane Austen, with her painfully circumlocutions, be more academically welcome than that woman (forget her name) who wrote 50 shades of gay? In many ways, old &quot;classical&quot; works are telling the exact same stories as modern &quot;trash novel&quot; works, except the modern &quot;trash novel&quot; works are doing it in such a way that is clear, simple, relevant (to today&#x27;s audience), and thus free of misunderstandings. From them, through clever literally mental contortions, one can still elucidate all the themes, lessons, and humanities like you could from confounding classics - just less obfuscated like &quot;there is no place like home&quot; instead of &quot;lost is my homecoming&quot;, &quot;...and then they had sex and fell in love...&quot; instead of &quot;...

And in my opinion as a flexible small business kind of guy, that&#x27;s a good thing. Large institutions were necessary for centuries for individual survival at the cost of individual self-actualization, but in today&#x27;s flexible scale era, it&#x27;s entirely possible to just be good at something and survive without having to give up your soul to a large corporation.

IMO, a startup who&#x27;s being held back by a domain shark is already in the wrong mindset and is probably going to fail.  Successful startups work with what&#x27;s available to them and pick up the domain they truly want when they have the capital to do so.  Facebook for example, started as thefacebook.com; they purchased facebook.com in 2005 for $200k<p>2.  Yes, .coms are becoming a rarity, but again - free economy; it&#x27;s all about supply and demand.  While .coms may be the ideal domain, it&#x27;s not like there aren&#x27;t other completely feasible choices out there.  If the .com isn&#x27;t available, why not .io?  .ninja?<p>3.  The drug analogy is incorrect and improper.  A better analogy is to think of domains as land.

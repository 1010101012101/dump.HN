4023081,comment,4022220,4022679,9,0,patio11,,,"You're sort of moving the target here.  I care very little about scoring Internet points, but I care very much about HNers not making decisions which will damage their business, so let's reiterate: it is categorically not the case that Google does not have a notion of domains.  Page A and Page B, given that they are on the same domain, can easily influence each other's rankings even without a link passed between A and B, by separately garnering trust for the domain.  This informs several SEO strategies which <i>will work</i> such as e.g. publishing OSS on your domain to get link juice and other indicia of trust which you then use to rank things that real people (and your bottom line) actually care about.<p>As to whether blog.example.com and www.example.com share trust metrics, sentiment among SEOs are mixed.  Consensus estimate among SEOs who I'd trust with my business would be close to ""blog.example.com and www.example.com are treated as at half-arms lengths for the purposes of accumulating link juice and virtually identically for the purpose of awarding link juice.""  This suggests that you want as few subdomains as reasonably possible for publicly visible content which will either attract links or which you want to rank.  For similar reasons, I'd suggest most startups would require a darn good reason to have more than one toplevel domain.<p>Google has said not to worry about this issue, but that a very common answer from Google when probed about any specifics of their algorithms.  Google will also say things like ""Quality content is 99% of SEO"" which if it is true is true in the sense that Santa Claus is true -- perhaps a good message to tell children but I would not base my ability to feed my employees' family on the likelihood of finding a jolly fat guy if I went to the North Pole to check.",1337946683

4023070,comment,4022789,4022885,2,0,jewbacca,,,"What you're inventing here is usually called ""unfold"".  I don't know javascript, but here it is in close relative Scheme:<p><pre><code>    (define (unfold p f g seed)
      (if (p seed)
        '()
        (cons (f seed) (unfold p f g (g seed)))))
</code></pre>
And how you would call it to print ""Hello world!"" 100 times:<p><pre><code>    (unfold (lambda (x) (> x 100))
            (lambda (x) (display ""Hello world""))
            (lambda (x) (+ x 1))
            1)
</code></pre>
'p' is your predicate.  It determines when to stop unfolding.  It takes the current value ('seed') and returns a boolean that's True when you're done.  It's your 'hasEnded'.<p>'f' is what to do for each 'seed' value.  In this case, it ignores the current value and just prints ""Hello world"".  It's your 'callback'.<p>'g' maps each 'seed' value to the next 'seed' value.  It's your 'modify'.<p>'seed' is the initial state for the unfold.  It's your 'initial'.<p>-----<p>There are a couple other caveats to do with this being an expression rather than a statement, but it doesn't really matter right now.  There are a million other cool things about unfolds (and folds, and other higher-order functions), but I'm not sure I could conscionably point you in the right direction since they lead to dangerous places.<p>Speaking of which, here is an unfold in Haskell, where it may (<i>may</i>) be clearer:<p><pre><code>    unfold p f g seed  | p seed    = []
                       | otherwise = x:xs
                           where
                             x  = f seed
                             xs = unfold p f g (g seed)

    sequence_ $ unfold (>100) (const $ print ""Hello world!"") (+1) 1
</code></pre>
I say 'an' unfold, because there are a whole bunch of cool ways to do it (and some of them look nothing like this).",1337946411

It's sort of like burying a mess under the rug: it's out of sight for awhile, until it festers, rots, and really starts to stink.<p>Sooner or later, Facebook was always going to have to monetize. Its deliberate strategy of putting off monetization until it became a de facto standard social network was a gamble. It seemed reasonable at the time to many inside and outside of Facebook. But my point is that, knowing what it was gambling on, Facebook shouldn't have taken in so much money that it was forced to go public before its gamble was ready to pay off. Now, it's going to have to start monetizing quickly and massively, come hell or high water -- at a time when it still doesn't quite know how to do so without pissing off its userbase.

You have to do harm all the time as a doctor - the question is what is the lesser harm? Would you rather have a few broken ribs, or a heart that isn't beating. Either way, you're causing harm. Most people would rather you crack a few ribs though.<p>(BTW, that phrase actually isn't part of the Hippocratic Oath [1][2])<p>Here's a different example. Is burning a religious text (Bible, Koran, etc...) ethical? What if it is in private? Is anyone harmed? Many people would consider this an unethical act, even if no one was around to see it. And if no one would see it (and thus be offended), where is the harm?<p>Another example: Imagine Alice is in a wheelchair and is shopping. She accidentally drops her phone on the floor. At that moment, Eve walks by, notices Alice struggling, and yet does nothing. Eve continues walking on her way. Did Eve cause Alice harm? Alice was already in trouble, and Eve didn't do anything help. However, Eve didn't do anything to <i>cause</i> Alice's problems. So you can't really claim that Eve harmed Alice, even though many would question her inaction.<p>This is just to point out that the concepts of <i>harm</i> and <i>ethics</i> aren't necessarily linked. But that is really moot in this case, because no one can really claim that this kid caused AOL <i>no</i> harm. It may just be really small in monetary terms.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.kevinmd.com/blog/2011/06/harm-part-hippocratic-oath.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kevinmd.com/blog/2011/06/harm-part-hippocratic-oa...</a>

Oh, and for every reporter who tried to discover the truth, 10 would take a statement from each side and imply that the truth must be somewhere in the middle.<p>Seriously, I would pay real money for accurate news and competent analysis. I've tried, I really have. But the available options are just awful. Editors want to move product, reporters want to finish 500 words by 5pm, and readers want to confirm their worldviews.",1337944025

If the Windows and Mac platforms are only accessible through App Stores then we, developers, will have to pay whatever royalty or percentage those companies see fit to charge. We may also lose the ability to publish software at all to those platforms if they so decide without much notice and maybe even without recourse.<p>Although we could pass the expense of the App Store or absorb the cost, I guess most software companies would go bankrupt if Microsoft or Apple cancelled their accounts.",1337943977

4022957,comment,4021755,4021755,1,0,rvkennedy,,,"It's long past time since Visual Studio was the only game in town. Back when it was between VS6 and Borland C++ Builder, I was initially attracted by Builder's drag-and-drop UI construction - it seemed very odd at the time that ""Visual"" studio didn't offer that functionality. But Borland's descent into bug-ridden stagnation and my discovery of wxWidgets pushed me into the VC++ world for upwards of a decade.<p>But now with Eclipse reaching maturity (it's the main IDE at the banking multinational where I recently worked), I'm finding less and less justification to stick with Visual Studio when my MSDN subscription expires. Another very promising tool is Qt Creator: <a href=""http://qt.nokia.com/products/developer-tools"" rel=""nofollow"">http://qt.nokia.com/products/developer-tools</a><p>This has less of the UI quirkiness of Eclipse, and the built-in documentation is great. Qt is now using Clang for code validation, but can be set to use Gcc or the Microsoft compiler. So given that I'm using Qt anyway for cross-platform UI, this may be the way forward.",1337943841

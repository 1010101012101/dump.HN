- Make sure your overview is very, very brief - it's really a positioning statement (""we sell software to telecommunications companies with over 500 employees"") not a history lesson, and
- Make the overview interactive. ""What have you heard about my firm?"" or ""Bob introduced us - can I ask what he told you about what we do?""<p>This last one shows how this step can be a great way to correct misinterpretations that can otherwise ruin a great demo.

808743,comment,808156,808650,0,0,10ren,,,"Historically, we SOTSOG - using abstractions, so complexity is pushed down to a lower layer (language, libraries, OS). I think this will continue to be how we cope with complexity - one specific case at a time, rather than a new general way to address all complexity issues (sounds like magic).<p>If the rate of complexity increase itself increases (i.e. accelerates), then we might need a a different methodology altogether, such formal verification as you suggest. However, we have had the need for better ways to handle complexity since before Fred's Mythical Man-month (IBM 360), and we've had the tool of formal verification techniques to do it for a long time. It hasn't happened yet, suggesting there is some problem with it.<p>In my admittedly very limited experience of formal verification, it makes problems <i>more</i> complex, rather than less (This is why Dijkstra says that you can't prove software the way it is currently written - you have to write it in a simpler way, with clearer interactions between modules and so on). Its benefit is that you know it's 100% correct (assuming your assumptions, understanding of the real-world problem, understanding of interactions with other components are all correct, your proof is correct, and any proof automation tools you use are also 100% correct). OK, it gives you a higher probability that it is correct.<p>Ah, this looks like the opposite cause and effect from your suggestion (that formal methods are a way to handle complexity), and instead that trying to formally verify applications <i>forces</i> us to write them in a simpler way, which is... simpler. Or, we could just write them in a simpler way, and not worry about the formal verification part. It still leaves the problem: what is this way of writing apps in a simpler way?
Isn't the only way to do this by dividing it into abstractions with well-defined behaviours and clear interfaces? In other words:
<i>Historically, we SOTSOG - using abstractions, so complexity is pushed down to a lower layer (language, libraries, OS).</i><p>PS: I would love it if there was a new general way to approach complexity. But as Fred said, ""no silver bullet"".<p><i>""better models for development that allow us to think about problems more abstractly""</i><p>That's possible I guess; but I don't think we lack in our ability to think about problems abstractly. It's finding the <i>right</i> abstraction that is tricky, and this amounts to a search through the space of abstractions. That sounds straightforward to automate, except that  he search space increases exponentially with the complexity of the problem. So we need a heuristic to guide that search.<p>So far, the best heuristic is <i>us</i>. If we can automate this guide through the search space - the ability to make connections, have intuitions and insights - it would be a huge leap towards Strong AI. My Masters was an approach to this, and the start of my PhD. Quite possible, I think, but hard.",1252307664

(this holds for your non-gui examples; gui programming always stuck me as a largely unsientific enterprise--probably proven by the code generated by gui builders [i have not checked in a long time, my experience is from jbuilder 4.0, which i hated anyways])<p>since you mentioned alan kay, you are probably interested in his recent work at vpri--check it out, there are some interesting papers and also a very good video at intel berkeley research lab:

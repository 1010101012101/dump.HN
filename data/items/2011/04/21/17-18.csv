When it happens in a way you don't have a plan for, update your plan.<p>Last I heard, reddit was operating with 1 sysadmin. If they had to employee the staff to run their own hardware AND own their own hardware, I suspect we wouldn't have reddit: it wouldn't be profitable. I'm also part of a startup, and thanks to AWS, we were able to be in two separate data centers from day 1. In the past companies, it's a struggle to get one up and running.<p>Plus, if they were running their own datacenter and had a 'network event', don't you think it would be down anyway? In fact, I'd expect more outages due to less available capacity to fail over to.<p>Running your machines on EC2 is no less risky than running them at Rackspace or any other non-cloud hosting providing. If there is an outage in core infrastructure, you're going to be down. If you think a 99.999 uptime guarantee means anything when the shit hits the fan, you've probably never worked with hosting providers before.",1303408781

'Showoff' says exactly what it does, lets you 'showoff' your work. What's a pagekite? (reminds of the 'mint' vs that unpronouncablely named finance site naming issue).""<p>That is feedback from a potential customer that I, as the customer, don't get any sense of what your product is about from the name. I cite by inference a great postmortem written up about the 'Mint' startup, and had you searched for 'mint postmortem' you could have come up with the link [1] below. The alternative to Mint was a website called Wesabe. Both Mint and Wesabe did personal finance, Wesabe was in some ways technically 'superior' to Mint and yet Mint ""won.""<p>So you have this bit of feedback on how the name you've chosen isn't helping your product get any visibility and you respond like this:<p>""Regarding the name, I actually think PageKite is an excellent name and we are lucky to have it. It's googlable, we got the .com for cheap, it's a strong trademark. If I draw you a picture of your site flying like a kite in the clouds, connected by a string to your laptop, you'll find the name is a perfect fit... :-)""<p>You tell me, your potential customer, that <i>I</i> am wrong in thinking your name doesn't tell me what I need to know about your site. And you go on to tell me how all it would take would be some graphic, which you don't have time to draw right now, of a kite made out of a web page flying in some clouds attached to your laptop to make it obvious.<p>Your name is a 'visual pun' which you no doubt find exceptionally clever, you know ""in the cloud"", ""easy as flying a kite"". Except that nobody types into a search engine ""How can I make my web site look like a kite?"" but they just might type in ""How can I show off my web site?"" Search engines are stupid, they will give lots of positive ranking love to the word 'showoff' is in the URL to showoff.io and zero ranking love to a site named 'pagekite'.<p>You added ""we got the .com for cheap"" which should be a clue. If you read the Mint postmortem Kagan says, <i>""The site was originally called mymint.com. I was initially against buying Mint.com but Aaron / Anton spent months acquiring the domain. This may seem inconsequential, but would you feel more comfortable entering your bank details on Wesabe.com or Mint.com?""</i><p>Do you see the difference in thinking there? One person thinking 'well we already have the domain, so we'll go with that' and the other saying ""I'm going to ask my customer to come to this site, what would they be more comfortable with?""<p>When I look back at your responses in this thread it is clear you are passionate about this project of yours and that is great. There have been a number of comments offering you feedback on both your product and your presentation. In nearly every case your response to that feedback is a combination of ""thank you for sharing, this is what you (the commenter) missed about that particular feature and why ours is better.""<p>When you responded as you did about the name I just thought to myself, ""Here is a brilliant guy who is going to be frustrated at how little traction his project gets until he can move himself mentally to a place where he can internalize the feedback and act on it.""<p>Its only an observation, I probably should have kept it to myself, and I have no doubt created more problems than good at this point. I'll go back to reading now.<p>[1] <a href=""http://okdork.com/2010/10/14/how-mint-beat-wesabe/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://okdork.com/2010/10/14/how-mint-beat-wesabe/</a>",1303407571

Of course this is quite fixable but until it is fixed the data presented is basically worthless.<p>The second, and arguably larger, problem is that the page makes grandiose claims about the applicability of the benchmark that it doesn't even attempt to back up. In particular the claim that the performance on JSLint will be a better proxy for ""other large, well-written JavaScript applications"" than existing benchmarks. If we examine the Microsoft paper linked, it says:<p>""Specific common behaviors of real web sites that are underemphasized in the benchmarks include event-driven execution, instruction mix similarity, cold-code dominance, and the prevalence of short functions""<p>It is not demonstrated, nor is it obviously apparent, that JSLint will be any more typical in these respects than other benchmarks. I haven't examined the JSLint source code but I assume it isn't event-driven, deals mainly with string manipulation and makes many calls to the same few functions during parsing. If my guesses are correct it sounds like it will not, on its own, be a significantly better proxy for real-world performance than existing benchmarks. Of course it may be that it exercises a different subset of the ECMAScript engine than existing benchmarks; in this case a test like this would be a good addition to, rather than replacement for, an existing benchmark suite.",1303407247

I thought the adoption of CoffeeScript is more like going the GWT way (not quite, but similar) --- you write code in CoffeeScript and let it generate all vanilla Javascript code doing the frontend work, e.g., communicating with the server, DOM manipulation. I do personally think that's a good approach. Now, you also have jQuery in the toolkit, which I suppose is used for DOM manipulation, that's another tool to learn. If you guys just replace Prototype with jQuery, it is reasonable, or just CoffeeScript, which is radical, but sounds like a neat approach. However, CoffeeScript + jQuery? I just don't think it make sense here. Honestly, I only have superficial knowledge of CoffeeScript and jQuery, I could be totally wrong.<p>Maybe somebody in the Rails core team should write a blog to clarify their strategy on their Javascript integration.",1303406760

2471386,comment,2470865,2471131,8,0,ssmoot,,,"That's an odd thing to say.<p>Internal networks can easily be more reliable than applications given that higher end equipment has a lot more money poured into it at a development level, and anything above the bottom end of the market typically has multiple layers of redundancy options available. Wether it's VRRP, stacking, bonding, IPMP, iSCSI channels etc.<p>EBS is unreliable, granted, but blaming the network seems faulty.<p>For one, it's nothing like NFS. For two, NFS can be adapted to highly-available systems fairly easily. These days it's a pretty simple system. Even with just a single Array, put two FreeBSD ""heads"" on it, MPIO connectivity, and CARP between the boxes. Monitor the CARP interface to import/export the file-systems and there you go. If you can tolerate a minute or two of downtime when a host fails you have reliable, automatic redundancy.<p>EBS, FCoE, iSCSI, et all are entirely different beasts. But again, you can make the hosts redundant pretty easily. With iSCSI you can give the clients multiple paths to the devices increasing reliability and available bandwidth without LACP. Consolidate storage needs to save money. It's win/win/win.<p>Networked storage, wether it's block devices or shared file-systems, whatever the technology, aren't going away anytime soon. Matter of fact, they're becoming more critical to operations day by day. And these days, they're one of the easiest things to setup, and ensure availability on.<p>That EBS is the weak-link at Amazon is a bit counter-intuitive based on my own experience. I wonder what the root problems actually are...",1303405799

It also gives instant gratification to the end-user, possibly increasing return customers.<p>Even without the robot, it'd be great to see my purchase cause an instant reaction. I could for example see the person start making my Domino's pizza order. I believe the increase of transparency/customer communication would increase return customers.<p>I also played around with the idea of paid real life internet interactions. This means that people would pay to rent a robot virtually. For example, I could rent a segway mounted webcam to check out and chat with people at a conference. Many others think towards robot surrogates a la anybots for rent. However, I think that the learning curve on those devices are still too high to be consumer (rent) practical. Furthermore, I don't think it'd be terribly entertaining or valuable. With that said, this type of device could be very popular/lucrative with those who are bedridden.<p>A better example of internet triggered robot interaction would be to pay around $5 to fire a robot controlled paintball gun; or $2 to throw a plate a wall etc. In other words, it'd be like an internet controlled vending machine of entertainment. Better still (especially for charities) would be to throw a ball at a dunk tank especially if there were celebrities. Imagine how much the Red Cross could raise if Justin Bieber volunteered for this internet enabled dunk tank.<p>Anyway, I'm just throwing out some ideas.

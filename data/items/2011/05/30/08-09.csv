It irks me precisely <i>because</i> I don't think I'm better than them, and thus am confounded as to why they seem to have more difficulty.

2598867,comment,2597832,2598571,8,0,jorangreef,,,"A corollary to this, always speak in private as you would in public. Never say anything about someone else you would not say to them directly (even if you're talking to your spouse about work issues whatever). Sometimes you think you need to, but looking back it's always better to keep your own voice strong and true. It's like playing a violin. The more wrong notes you hit when you practice in private, the more wrong notes you hit when you perform in public. Eventually the bad notes resonate so much they start affecting the voice of the instrument and it starts to develop poor tone in and of itself. The wood particles start to re-align themselves. That's what separates the great instruments from the cheap instruments. Sure the great instruments were made well to start, but they were also played well throughout their lives. Always speak in private as you would in public.",1306744396

When starting a new project, like everybody else, I'm usually faced with several different options on how I'm going to design it, which libraries I'm going to use, what the overall architecture is going to look like, what features I'll implement and so on. And very often, I get stuck deciding between two options, weighing which one  is better, which one might prove to be a bad decision in the future and which one might make my code more flexible/inflexible to change and refactoring.<p>But then I slap myself (figuratively, of course) and remember to ""just do it"". To just release any kind of working code, never mind if it's a suboptimal design, never mind if there are a few bugs or if it's slower than it could be.

But look at the dates, it didn't really took off before 1995, and even then, most people didn't have a connexion yet.  The internet is still young.  Not many people are using it fully, and we are already seeing significant (though not huge) effects.<p>Compare the internet and the printing press.  The printing press allowed people to read.  This was huge.  But this was also slow.  It took time to spread, and it took more time to get to the enlightenment, and the revolutions that ensued.<p>Now, the internet is allowing people to <i>write</i>.  This is equally huge.  Remember the old, pious principles about freedom of expression?  Until the internet, few had that freedom:politicians, journalists, eminent union leaders, and that was it.  Now <i>everyone</i> can publish.<p>The internet will enable revolutions.  Probably not now, it is too young, but  See what is currently happening in Spain.  There currently is a huge protest, which is now becoming more than a mere protest.  They are constructively discussing about how to run the country, while explicitly avoiding ""politics""[1].  They are too big to be ignored by the mainstream media, <i>even here in France</i>.  Their main communication and organization tool is the internet.  Without this many-to-many communication platform, they just couldn't have done it.<p>They may not succeed, but they at least have a chance.  And I predict there will be more like it.

It's designed to sacrifice performance and hardware access to provide a safe way for websites to display rich content.  Additionally for non-canvas apps, you must interact with the convoluted mess that is the DOM.<p>Lower level languages are generally designed for maximum performance, and full-access to hardware.  The assumption is that only trusted applications will be run.<p>In summary, html5 is a school playground where all the kids run in slow motion and the toys are made of plastic.  You can sort of make new toys out of sand, but they are fragile and not that fun.",1340049586

4128169,comment,4127516,4127948,1,0,the_bear,,,"I think that srunni's answer is probably a good start, but I'd also add another approach. Until recently, the Wash U CS program was run with a heavy focus toward academics rather than industry. As a result, most of the really talented students weren't really going to career fairs, they were instead looking for interesting research positions. It's possible that things have changed since I left (there's a new dean and department head), but I'd guess it's still about the same.<p>If that's the case, you really need a way to reach those top tier students. Do you have any positions that would seem intellectually rigorous and interesting? If so, I'd find a professor with relevant interests and shoot them an email saying you're looking for a top-tier intern and that you have some really cool problems for them to work on. Some professors are obviously more industry-friendly than others, but in my experience, there are at least a few who would probably be willing to help.<p>Another option would be to host an event at Wash U. I'm not entirely sure how this works from a logistical standpoint, but it's common at Wash U for companies to reserve rooms for different types of recruiting events. Some companies might host hack-a-thons. Some might do giveaways. EA did a presentation on how video games get made. Those events generally get a lot more attention from the top tier students than the career fair booths, and professors often promote them at the end of class. I'd guess that contacting the Career Center would be your first step if you want to set something like that up.<p>Hope that helps.",1340049355

If an app like this one floats up all the filters and publicly shames them, they will take down the app and probably all the other apps by the developer.

Well, sure, if someone has anecdotal evidence that the theory of gravity is wrong, or that 1 + 1 = 4, by all means downvote them, but not all scientific evidence is on such solid ground.<p>E.g., I've been prescribed medication and ended up with a side effect not listed on the drug literature. The doctor told me that the side-effect must be psychosomatic. Later scientific evidence revealed that about 50% of patients given the drug experienced the same side effect, but that it had been previously underreported. Who's to say that researchers would have even bothered to research the side effects more thoroughly if they hadn't paid attention to the fact that the anecdotal evidence contradicted the scientific evidence.<p>Or remember when the scientific evidence seemed to indicate that a high carbohydrate, low fat diet was the healthiest choice? Should I have ignored my anecdotal evidence that that diet made me feel like crap?<p>Science sometimes gets itself into harmful orthodoxies. See Thomas Kuhn for more info on this if you are unfamiliar. One example of this is Behaviorism in Psychology. In this field, it was scientific orthodoxy for many decades that Behaviorism was scientific and Cognitive Psychology was not because Behaviorism was based on only quantifiable, measurable data. It took Chomsky to point out the idiocy of this orthodoxy, thereby breaking the orthodoxy, allowing science to progress.<p>Re the anecdotal evidence that saved my career, I've read here that there is no scientific evidence that ergonomic keyboards can help prevent or ameleroate RSI. I am 100% sure, however, that the Kinesis Contour keyboard saved my ability to type. All I have to do to know this for sure is listen to my body. Furthermore, I personally know about a dozen programmers who feel similiarly. I'm sure that someone will pipe in that this is almost certainly the placebo effect. If that's the case, then Kinesis makes the world's very best placebo, as placebo-like things have done precious little for me in any other area. In any case, even if it were the placebo effect, what does it hurt anyone to ignore the putative scientific evidence and try out a Kinesis keyboard for themselves to see if it provides them with relief?<p>The idea that posts should be downvoted for recommending such ergonomic keyboards is insane.",1340048540

I'm sure other people have had this reaction, but it mostly results from not fully understanding what Org-mode is and how it works.  Org-mode is many things to many people, with a feature set that's deep and wide, and even many Org-mode users don't know everything it does, barely scratch the surface.<p>Regarding the issue of running an Emacs server alongside VimOrganizer:  Would you rather a tiny Vim project try to duplicate all of Orgmode's functionality when (1) only a small percentage of Org-mode directly involves editing text, (2) many of the major Org-mode features are basically batch operations that export and/or evaluate an entire file at a time, and (3) Emacs is lightweight and functions well as a server for Org-mode batch operations, and (4) Vim's stated philosophy is to co-exist and interoperate with other apps in the Unix toolchain?<p>It's a matter of not reinventing the wheel.  Org-mode is a pretty large project, probably approaching 100k lines of code.  It's been around many years, heavily developed the entire time and it still presents a quickly moving target, new features and bugfixes added almost daily.  What sense does it make to try to duplicate tens of thousands of lines of non-editing related code in a fledgling Vim project?  Why not make use of Emacs/Orgmode as a server, a function it does well, and leverage the entire Orgmode project?<p>Although most heavy VimOrganizer uses would want to keep an Emacs server running, they don't ever need to edit a file in Emacs.  At most they need to do some minor configuration in the .emacs config file, but that can be done by editing the .emacs file in Vim.",1340048391

Simplified, there are three types of customers. The first shop in traditional stores, find what they like, and purchase it. The second browse and purchase online, without ever seeing the physical merchandise. The third browse traditional ""showrooms,"" then proceed to buy from a cheaper online retailer.<p>With an online and traditional presence, manufacturers capture all three types of customers. If you limit yourself to traditional stores, you force the third type of customer to purchase in-store, because there is no cheaper online alternative. But those customers would buy online anyway, so you gain nothing. And you've completely lost the second type of customer, who only shops online. A simplified model, perhaps, but the principle stands.<p>I'm honestly not too worried. I <i>like</i> going to the mall. My mother practically lives at Target and Wal-Mart.

4128085,comment,4127516,4128005,2,0,srunni,,,"> While other departments are seeing incredible growth and development, the school of engineering is relatively quiet. It simply hasn't been a priority when huge grants for health and biomedical sciences are ripe for the picking.<p>It also doesn't help that the Department of Biomedical Engineering has been growing like crazy, both at the graduate and undergraduate levels - the Spring 2012 (undergraduate) graduating class sizes for each department in the School of Engineering were as follows:<p><pre><code>    Biomedical Engineering: 100
    Computer Science & Engineering: 35
    Electrical Engineering: 18
    Systems Science & Engineering: 23
    Chemical Engineering: 32
    Civil Engineering: 3
    Chemical Engineering: 56
    Information Management: 3
</code></pre>
Interest in biomedical (and, to a lesser degree, chemical) engineering simply outstrips interest in any other engineering discipline (and interest is still growing - the graduating class size of 2016 will probably be at least 150 for biomedical), and the School of Engineering doesn't want to fix something that isn't broken. There's nothing wrong with biomedical engineering, but if other departments, such as CS or EE, want to grow, they'll have to take the initiative on their own, because the School of Engineering as a whole is happy with the way things are trending right now.",1340048067

The Career Center pushes CareerLink hard with students, so if you post jobs on there, there's a good chance you'll get some bites.<p>I attended a career fair just this spring, and it was <i>packed</i> with students - there were sometimes lines up to 10 people deep just to talk with industry representatives. Don't give up so quickly on direct-to-school recruiting.<p>You should also look into offering summer internships for current students. IIRC, WUSTL will match whatever you pay interns, making it less of a financial burden for you, while still making it worth the student's while.

Nobody's actions are interesting, meaningful, or seem to flow from any significant motive other than to conform to the plot. One of the most dramatic scenes in the movie (when Janek decides to commit suicide by ramming the engineer's ship) comes off as completely anti-climactic because it comes out of nowhere. Similarly, the major revelation of the movie of the planet being a biowarfare research station comes out of Janek's mouth but it is so out of place and out of character that you can almost hear the clanking boilerplate of dreaded exposition falling into position. Perhaps the most interesting character of the entire movie, David, remains nothing more than an automaton throughout the movie with only a gnat's whisker of a hint that he is anything more.<p>Prometheus the fictional spaceship is a ""trillion dollar"" mission which is unaccountably staffed by a handful of incompetents, fuckups, and pseudo-villains who throw away their lives for the silliest and least meaningful of reasons.

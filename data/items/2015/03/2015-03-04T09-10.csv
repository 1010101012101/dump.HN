They are not a panacea of course as they introduce significant complexity, whatever language they are implemented in - it&#x27;s a matter of trade-offs and once your monolith reaches a certain size it might be worth splitting it up.<p>Re libraries, most of the ones you mention have analogues in go or are pretty simple to replace, save AWS, which is apparently coming soon:<p>AWS - <a href=""https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/coming-soon-aws-sdk-for-go/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/coming-soon-aws-sdk-for-go/</a><p>Sidekiq - go myFunc()<p>Devise - bcrypt.CompareHashAndPassword + the mailer functions<p>Deployment - Rsync or Ansible - this is simpler in go as all you require are your executable + templates",1425463091

So without capturing headers you don&#x27;t even know what operations are being called. Take Apache logs for example - all you&#x27;ll see is a load of POST calls to /MySOAPServiceEndpoint. Whereas with a nicely designed REST service, you can at least see the gist of what is happening without additional logging.<p>And take testing - you need to pull out the heavy artillery (SOAP UI is very good) to test a SOAP service. Whereas REST can be done quite easily (even more so if it&#x27;s GET), from a browser or a simple python script.<p>Not huge issues, and if you&#x27;re working on a big project it won&#x27;t make a big difference.

We’re transforming translation, from a burden to a major competitive advantage.<p>Our solution provides customers access to:
* High-quality translations from certified professionals.
* A platform that can handle any project size.
* Time savings by smoothly integrating translation with your business workflow, through our API.
* Prices as low as half the rates of a translation agency.<p>We’re a couple of weeks before launching and we’re looking for partners. For our launch partners, we are open to feature requests and can provide full attention and technical support. Furthermore, as an appreciation for our launch partners’ time we offer a further discount on our already competitive pricing for their first projects.<p>If you are interested, I along with Mark, the founder of Lexiful, would be glad to answer your questions. If you would like to do business together or know somebody who might need our services, send us an email to info@lexiful.com.<p>Feedback is more than welcome!",1425462067

Obviously the smaller the framework you load for each process, the less memory you&#x27;re going to use, but there are also architectural differences in the languages which seem to add up to significant memory usage in the case of Ruby.<p>Because to scale ruby you&#x27;ll typically add more processes, and to scale go you&#x27;ll just let it start another thread (the http server does this for you), that difference adds up to a significant difference when you have a lot of traffic.<p>That&#x27;s not to say that Ruby is impossible to scale and I love Ruby the language, but it is a bit slower and a bit more memory intensive than Go.",1425462038

(say  `(((a+b)+c)+..+z)` or `(a+(b+(c+...+z)))` or ...).
And if we have to compute the sum of two lists xs and ys,
we can compute either `sum(append(xs,ys))` or `sum(sum(xs),sum(ys))`.<p>Likewise, if we can &quot;pull up Collect nodes and push down Computation nodes&quot; in some cases
this is not because the involved computation commutes,
but because the operation is in some sense compatible
with the collection structure and its collect operation.<p>What we need is an associative operation used to merge the results computed on parts of the collection, so:<p><pre><code>  computation(merge_dataset(xs,ys)) = merge_results(computation(xs),computation(ys))

</code></pre>
For summation and counting, the merge operation is addition.
For filtering the merge operation is simply the former collection collect operation.
So we have:<p><pre><code>        sum(append(xs,ys)) = sum(sum(xs),sum(ys))
        count(append(xs,ys)) = sum(count(xs),count(ys))
        filter(append(xs,ys)) = append(filter(xs),filter(ys))

9143358,comment,9139817,9142244,0,0,ivanb,,,"Yes. They should. Currently DOM works in an imperative, immediate way. Kind of like a Basic program or OpenGL immediate mode. After a write to a property you are guaranteed to get the same value back after you read the property. The dependent properties are also guaranteed to be updated immediately. Surprisingly, this imperative way of programming is actually not efficient at all because subsequent writes and reads may cause reflow.<p>To prevent this the programming model should be changed. There are two ways that I can imagine.<p>- Introduce &quot;DOM batching mode&quot;. In this mode remove the immediate mode guarantees. If you specify an element width you are no longer guaranteed to read it back until the layout occurs. So store your intermediate element width somewhere if you want to use it. Of course you don&#x27;t need to specify batching mode for all the DOM tree. Just the majority of it that doesn&#x27;t require custom layout.<p>- IIUC the majority of times that you need to perform multiple reads and writes of the DOM properties is due to special layout requirements. In some cases CSS layout may not be enough. There should be an API that allows to specify custom layout strategy for a parent DOM element. JavaScript should be fast enough. The additional benefit is that we would no longer need to wait for e.g. Flexbox adoption. Just roll your own.<p>It is obvious that we are trying to turn HTML into a GUI framework. So let&#x27;s do it properly.<p>The problems we are facing with DOM have already been solved by multiple game engines and GUI frameworks.",1425460624

9143350,comment,9142819,9143317,0,0,patio11,,,"This is a function of how Rails does concurrency, which is by using multiple processes.  Each additional process consumes X MB.  If you have something which needs a throughput of 100 requests per second, and each request takes 0.2 seconds, you require a minimum of 20 Rails processes and you probably want to have more.<p>The X is largely dependent on how many dependencies your app pulls in, on your garbage collection settings, and on how much state you carry around with you.  I don&#x27;t know what an off-the-shelf Rails app requires as a minimum, but as a comparable, BCC requires ~120 MB per process and AR requires approximately ~200 MB.  Neither are particularly mammoth code bases.<p>Thus, if AR develops a business requirement for 100 requests per second on something which takes 200 ms per request, my server budget just increased by 4 GB of RAM.  That is absolutely unavoidable in the Rails concurrency model.  It doesn&#x27;t matter how well you code the small thing at issue: you pay a memory tax based on desired maximum volume and app complexity, always.<p>(Neither here nor there, but AR has features quite similar to the notification feature that the app described in this article.  We handle this by using queue workers -- which each require 200 MB, as described above -- and the decision that queues do not require <i>immediate</i> servicing.  Instead, if thousands of calls are dumped into the system, we add them to a queue <i>quickly</i> and then consume the queue <i>leisurely</i>.  Different apps are different apps, but I&#x27;d wager a guess that we do substantially more volume in terms of calls on ~400 MB of RAM.)<p>Also neither here nor there, but engineers are expensive and gigabytes are cheap.  There exist many circumstances in which the architecture which requires 12 GB of RAM is a defensible engineering tradeoff versus the one which takes 5 MB.  As Thomas told me once when I was asking him how to cut 100 MB off of Redis so that I could avoid upgrading a VPS by 1 GB: &quot;How much does the extra gig cost?  $10?

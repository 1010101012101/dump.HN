4640286,comment,4639941,4640213,2,0,dspillett,,,"Apple broke that status quo by not allowing flash on iDevices at all. They had the advantage of the Steve/Apple ""the people like it because we say they should and they think we a cool"" super-power though, which MS do not currently poses, <i>and</i> they had both the performance (much Flash code is badly written and would devour battery life) and UI (much flash code that is out there won't work well on a touch-screen interface) caveats which are easier for the user-on-the-street (at least those I've talked to) to get their head around than security & stability problems.<p>This is though the first test of kicking flash in the teeth in a less restricted environment than the iDevice ecosystem, so it is still a brave move to be the first to do so (time will tell whether it is a brave move in the Yes Minister use of the word ""brave""!).<p>One key fact that will help is that there is a growing perception amongst people who don't even know what Flash <i>is</i> that Flash is an out-dated technology, mainly because of the iDevice thing (if your site/app won't run on my iPad because of this ""flash"" thing, your flash thing is wrong not my shiny shiny). This will help MS and other browser makers as it reduces the uphill struggle convincing people that losing the feature is not too much to pay for the potential security and stability benefits.<p>Of course the other key factor will be what sites are on the white-list and how they address not being if they aren't (do they change tech, do they follow what-ever procedure is needed to get on the whitelist, or do they just tell their users ""IE10 doesn't work here""?). I can name many video sites that MS won't want to be seen to support and won't want to make changes or pay for certification (or what-ever is needed) in order to get on the white list. A great many people use those sites regularly while pretending they don't know they exist - if those sites don't move to HTML5-video (with the problems that still exist there) or somehow get on the white-list those people might find some reason to switch to Chrome/Firefox/other (or stick with IE9) rather than upgrade to IE10.",1349952961

Patrick's consulting rate has more than septupled since he began consulting (or possibly just this year, can't remember.)<p>2. The longest he has ever waited to get paid by a client he would be happy to work with again is nine months.<p>3. On a related note: The bigger your client is the more bureaucratic BSthey will have so they get the special I expect dealing with you on a business level to be hell surcharge.<p>4. Becoming a consultancy is a different deal from being a consultant, even an extremely high end one. Brennan made less as yhe principal of a consultancy than as a consultant for the first year and a half. If you take the <i>commendable</i> attitude that making payroll is sacred you should have $30K set aside for Despite cashflow issues, we made payroll purposes.<p>5. On a related note: When the business has a bumper year employees get a 3-5% payrise. When things are looking like shit they still get paid what was previously negotiated, on time. Most people are, quite sensibly, risk averse. If they want the upside they can take the downside too.<p>There is a great deal more that's very valuablr in the transcript, like the discussion of the change in attitude that comes with charging more nut those struck me especially. Oh, and there's a link to a tptacek ccomment that is step by step guide to making LOTS AND LOTS OF MONEY.",1349952435

4640267,comment,4639085,4640184,7,0,Silhouette,,,"To be clear, I'm not asking because I'm concerned about my rates. I don't work full-time on contract projects as I have other business interests as well, but even when I do, I seem to be somewhere around what Patrick considered the sweet spot in terms of size of client, who I'm dealing with, etc.<p>I just wish that if people who have been consulting for a relatively short time themselves want to share their advice with others who might be thinking of going down that path, they would give some sort of meaningful context to guide those other people about what to expect in practice. Otherwise, we're going to have a whole load of people who were actually on perfectly respectable if not exceptional rates, who were happy doing the work they were doing, whose clients were happy with the work they were doing, and who can't conveniently tie their personal contribution to an X% increase in the total profits of their clients, yet who then think they should be charging 10x as much and start going after new clients with unrealistic expectations. In most places, the software development industry is still quite a small world, and I'm genuinely concerned that such an approach is going to damage young developers' careers.<p>To be frank, I'm deeply skeptical about the current round of Tim Ferriss-style ""Make More Money Than God In Five Minutes"" discussions on HN. There are some interesting perspectives, and I'm certainly not criticising Patrick or any of the other guys for volunteering their points of view. But I do think quite a lot of that advice is going to be hard for many people to apply in practice, because the context won't be the same, and I do think it's borderline irresponsible to push the advice in as general and unqualified a form as sometimes happens, even if it happens with the best of intentions.",1349952280

To be quite honest; they all seem equally flawed to me. The fact that jQuery, Bootstrap, and others originated out of overcoming fragmentation pretty much proofs that point.

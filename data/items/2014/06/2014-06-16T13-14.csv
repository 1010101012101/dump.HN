So I guess I don&#x27;t understand your point w.r.t. the thesis of the original article. Do you agree with the article but disagree that Wal-Mart is an example? Or what? Could you clarify?<p>> I&#x27;m asserting Wal-Mart as example uncompetitive environment is, in the general case, nuts.<p>To repeat myself, there&#x27;s more than one way for companies to behave anti-competitively.<p>Wal-mart cannot afford to screw consumers, so they find other ways to leverage their status as a mega-corp -- squeezing local government via tifs (this corn field/park/10 year old walmart is &quot;blighted&quot;, so give us 15 year tax break to build a new one),  paying poorly compared to other players in the market, abusing or undercutting supply chain partners, etc..<p>> but making groceries cost more is a freakishly regressive sort of way to attempt to redistribute wealth<p>Well, we could one-up Wal-Mart and make all the groceries completely free by enslaving all those involved in food production. So this is clearly an over-simplification.<p>It&#x27;s also a false choice. Wal-Mart could instead decrease its profits and play nicer with everyone (like many of its local chain competitors do, arguably because they don&#x27;t have the huge legal/PR/marketing team and cash reserves which can buy F-U leverage against local governments and labor groups -- this coercive power that comes with being so big is at the heart of the article&#x27;s thesis).<p>Also, the price difference vs. wage difference between Walmart and its competitors also puts the lie to this claim -- even an extra 1.00+ an hour way more than offsets an extra .10 cents on the dollar for groceries.",1402927197

You basically have to learn multiple languages to some degree in Europe. In the US you can travel larger distances than all of Europe and speak only one language. Additionally, with English being one of the common business languages, you find that many non-English speaking countries learn English. Americans don&#x27;t need to learn English (well, some might). Should they learn another language or three, of course. Is it necessary for everyday life? No. Most Americans have never left their country and likely never will. The extent of their driving can get them places that speak Spanish and French (maybe Portuguese if they REALLY drive).<p>I get it, Americans are fun to bash for numerous reasons, but it really annoys me when the bashing is not thought through enough to be valid.",1402927181

Are you absolutely sure your meaning of introvert isn&#x27;t idiosyncratic?<p>This is the sort of thing I remember David Hume writing an essay about. If someone wants to be alone, there is absolutely nothing non-genuine about that desire, even if it&#x27;s unproductive or you yourself think someone should want something else instead.<p>The response to &quot;I want X but I can&#x27;t make work&quot; probably shouldn&#x27;t be &quot;You should want Y instead&quot;.<p>Different people also want different things from friendships. So if there are two friends, and one sees hanging out as only the means to establishing a deeper intimate friendship, but hanging out and having fun is the main purpose of the friendship to the other, then that&#x27;s not such a great friendship.<p>I don&#x27;t think what you said is necessarily very good advice.",1402927053

Its dangerous to hike alone.

So lets go to the coffee shop after class and discuss the homework further, etc.  So find the local higher ed school and ask the teacher if they&#x27;d like the help of a native speaker, even if all you do during class is sip a soda I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll get all the attention you can tolerate both before and after class.

The character limit is also a significant handicap (and makes little sense now that SMS is being replaced by IM).<p>Google+ with its circles seemed like a perfect solution to this problem, but unfortunately, except for topics related to technology, there seems to be very little interaction going on.

Now we think of the middle class as people who are neither rich nor poor, but originally they were a distinct group. In a feudal society, there are just two classes: a warrior aristocracy, and the serfs who work their estates. The middle class were a new, third group who lived in towns and supported themselves by manufacturing and trade.<p>Starting in the tenth and eleventh centuries, petty nobles and former serfs banded together in towns that gradually became powerful enough to ignore the local feudal lords. [10] Like serfs, the middle class made a living largely by creating wealth. (In port cities like Genoa and Pisa, they also engaged in piracy.) But unlike serfs they had an incentive to create a lot of it. Any wealth a serf created belonged to his master. There was not much point in making more than you could hide. Whereas the independence of the townsmen allowed them to keep whatever wealth they created.<p>Once it became possible to get rich by creating wealth, society as a whole started to get richer very rapidly. Nearly everything we have was created by the middle class. Indeed, the other two classes have effectively disappeared in industrial societies, and their names been given to either end of the middle class. (In the original sense of the word, Bill Gates is middle class.)<p>But it was not till the Industrial Revolution that wealth creation definitively replaced corruption as the best way to get rich. In England, at least, corruption only became unfashionable (and in fact only started to be called &quot;corruption&quot;) when there started to be other, faster ways to get rich.</i>&quot;<p><a href=""http://paulgraham.com/gap.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://paulgraham.com/gap.html</a>",1402925590

In 1936 it was nowhere near the scientific consensus -- that didn&#x27;t happen until the discovery of the Cosmic Microwave Background, 29 years later.<p>But knowledge of the Big Bang and the Hubble redshift aren&#x27;t, by themselves, sufficient to explain what Stapledon wrote. Those things just show that the universe <i>has</i> expanded. For most of the 20th century, people assumed that the acceleration of the universe would diminish -- either asymptotically approaching zero, or reversing into a &quot;Big Crunch&quot;. For the galaxies to accelerate beyond the point where photons can bridge the gaps between them, they need to not only have been accelerated, but to <i>keep accelerating</i>, which is a very unintuitive notion (what would be driving the acceleration?)<p>My guess is that Stapledon was influenced by Einstein&#x27;s Cosmological Constant, which predicted exactly this kind of acceleration, but which Einstein himself had repudiated several years earlier, calling it &quot;his biggest blunder&quot;. When I first read Star Maker in 1997, I figured that even if Stapledon had been up-to-the-minute about the Big Bang, he somehow  hadn&#x27;t gotten the memo about the Cosmological Constant. So I chalked this passage up as one of several things that Stapledon had definitely gotten wrong.<p>A year later, Dark Energy was discovered, and suddenly it appeared that Stapledon was right all along. This did my head in a bit. Somehow, Stapledon had been spectacularly smart/lucky in crafting his story from a mix of freshly-proposed and freshly-discarded theories. So no, clairvoyance isn&#x27;t  strictly necessary to explain this. But just to be safe, I&#x27;ll retain that parenthetical question mark after &quot;fictional(?)&quot; when describing Star Maker.",1402925490
7898921,comment,7898035,7898035,3,0,rfzabick,,,"My advice? Learn to partner dance. I always say it&#x27;s the most fun you can have with modular arithmetic.<p>I&#x27;m pretty introverted, but I&#x27;ve been an enthusiastic swing dancer for 17 years now. Start by taking classes. You&#x27;ll meet a bunch of people. Also, there&#x27;s a structure to the interactions there. You&#x27;re all there to learn, you&#x27;re all just starting out in the dance, you&#x27;re all meeting each other for the first time, etc. After a few months, you&#x27;ll start making friends from classes. Somewhere in your first 1-3 months of classes, you&#x27;ll go out dancing socially, like to a bar, or a club, or a concert, etc. You&#x27;ll meet more people there, too. Also, it&#x27;s super fun!<p>Another thing that has been great for me about dancing is that it&#x27;s social, but it&#x27;s not very verbal unless I want it to be. There have been many times I&#x27;ve felt drained and didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of energy holding up a conversation. On those nights, I&#x27;d go out for an evening of dancing and dance with 1 or 2 dozen different women and barely said more than &quot;Would you like to dance?&quot; and &quot;Thank you for the dance.&quot; I&#x27;m a native English speaker, but I still find conversation draining sometimes. Dance gives me a way to get out of the house and interact with people and avoid staying in the house and compounding anxiety. Also, it&#x27;s super fun!<p>Pick a dance where people go out and dance socially at places other than dance studios (swing/lindy hop or salsa are your best bets. IMHO, lindy hop is far and away the best. Also, there are tons of guys in IT in lindy hop, so you&#x27;ll fit right in.) Technically, people can ballroom dance anywhere, but in practice, at least in Chicago, there are no weekly ballroom events that I know of outside of ballroom dance schools. The reason I advise this is that classes are great for learning the dance and for having a social structure to rely on, but you also want to have unstructured social time with people you&#x27;ve been meeting in classes. Also, you&#x27;ll meet more people this way and dancing socially is a ton of fun. If you have a weekly dance or two to go see friends at, it&#x27;s easier to stick with classes than if you&#x27;re taking classes so that you can get better for... taking more classes.",1402925487

Bromley or South Croydon is full of actual countryside and the occasional bit of woodland with far fewer people, and still in London, for example. You&#x27;ll find quiet or quieter parks dotted around the outer edge of London if you just look a bit. If you don&#x27;t need completely quiet, there are plenty of <i>quieter</i> places closer to the centre too. Like the river walkway from around Imperial Wharf (on the north side of the river) towards Barnes, and further towards Richmond (Barnes and Richmond and the area in between also have plenty of quiet areas). Especially if you walk into residential areas instead of near the commercial districts.<p>The solution of going further out applies to pretty much anything in London: Avoid zone 1 and 2 unless you want big, loud, expensive and commercialised.

While I don&#x27;t claim that everything is perfect, my experience is that for the past few years Mozilla has taken Firefox performance issues extremely seriously.<p>For example, I started a project called MemShrink exactly three years ago to reduce Firefox&#x27;s memory consumption. In fact, I even wrote a blog post today that discussed the major improvements from the past year, and what areas we still fall short on: <a href=""https://blog.mozilla.org/nnethercote/2014/06/16/memshrinks-3rd-birthday/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://blog.mozilla.org/nnethercote/2014/06/16/memshrinks-3...</a>.

That was almost two years ago.<p>As for pdf.js, here&#x27;s the bug I filed last year about it using too much memory: <a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=881974"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=881974</a>. The title of the bug is &quot;pdf.js uses too much memory&quot;.

Is China still communist? The definition still applies somewhat in that they still have a lot of state owned businesses, and the banks which borrows capital to private business are state-owned. It can be argued. Does China have a complete lack of freedom to change the status quo? Only from a naive western perspective. There is only one party, but China&#x27;s way is, if you want to change the state you join the party or work for the government (membership is not necessary to hold a government position). In other words, they consider it democracy through participation. A single person certainly has the ability to change the status quo, basically in the same way as in the west. Who really thinks voting actually matters much any more?<p>I don&#x27;t condone China&#x27;s way. I think the lack of acceptance for political dissent is disgusting. But that&#x27;s besides the point. Point is, we can&#x27;t fool ourselves into thinking China is like a dictatorship. They have other processes, but still achieves a decent meritocracy.<p>I&#x27;m beginning to think that democracy is a failure at the federal/union level. Look at the US and the EU. How functional is the democracy at that level these days? Maybe having so many people vote for a single/a few position makes democracy ineffective? I think these observations is why China is not jumping on the democracy bandwagon at the top level (they have implemented local elections).",1402924585

The browser measurement includes the browser&#x27;s overhead. On my non-retina MBP a freshly started Firefox 30 yields an RSS of 240MB (Preview — the system&#x27;s default image and PDF viewer — is 16MB and grows to 44MB on opening the Tracemonkey PDF). And that&#x27;s with just Firebug and the WD toolbar, we&#x27;ve got no idea what manners of extensions or building options OP has. And for reference, opening the Tracemonkey PDF grows Firefox&#x27;s RSS from 240 to 350MB.<p>3. The article&#x27;s measurements includes rendered and cached pages, opening the TraceMonkey PDF grows my Firefox&#x27;s RSS to 350MB but browsing to the end (and ensuring every page is loaded) ends up with a 480MB RSS, a behaviour which also exists (to a lower extent) on Preview, which grows from 44MB RSS to 85MB (then back down to 62MB)<p>4.

7898791,comment,7898035,7898035,189,0,jonnathanson,,,"Here is a lesson I&#x27;ve learned the long, hard way after 30 years of being a strong introvert: it&#x27;s not how or where you meet people that counts. It&#x27;s how you stay in touch.<p>Look around you. Every day, in every situation imaginable, there are hundreds of ways to meet people. There really are. You could strike up a conversation with a stranger on a subway. You could ask for some advice from the girl ahead of you in line at the supermarket. You could ask your coworkers to hang out, or join them for lunch. You could go to meetup groups, or meet people online and transition to real-world encounters. Point is, &quot;How do I meet people?&quot; is the most commonly asked question -- and it&#x27;s usually the wrong one.<p>If you&#x27;re a true introvert, your biggest enemy is yourself. It&#x27;s your <i>desire</i> to be alone. It&#x27;s your preference for living by yourself, for quiet moments away from others, for nights spent at home, watching Netflix or playing games. Making friends means making an effort to hang out with them, even when it doesn&#x27;t seem like the most immediately pleasurable, comfortable, or convenient thing to do at any given moment.<p>I hate making plans. But once I&#x27;m in mid-plan with a friend or two, I have a great time. And yet, somehow I never seem to put two and two together. I tend to decline or avoid a lot of social plans. I&#x27;m sabotaging my own friendships when I do that. Friendships are like pets; they need to be fed, walked, and watered. Some of your friends will be super outgoing, and they&#x27;ll do most of the work for you. But some of your friends won&#x27;t; they&#x27;ll be the passive party and expect you to make the plans. And either type of friend will occasionally, if not often, expect you to make the plans. That&#x27;s what happens in a mutual friendship.<p>So I&#x27;d ask you to ask yourself: is your problem really about meeting people, or is it about staying engaged with people? If it&#x27;s about meeting people (shyness), there is plenty of good advice on this thread about how to do it. If it&#x27;s about spending time with people (introversion), that&#x27;s going to require some regular, concerted effort to battle against your own inclinations. Sort of like battling the urge to procrastinate. You&#x27;ll have to battle the urge to self-isolate. You&#x27;ll want to focus less on the initial &quot;ugh&quot; factor in making or anticipating plans, and more on the fun you&#x27;ll be having when you&#x27;re hanging out.<p>Friendships don&#x27;t just click into place on the first interaction between two or more people. They depend on proximity and frequency. They take time to develop, and once they&#x27;ve developed, they need to be maintained. They are conditional, and you need to live up to whatever the conditions may be in any given relationship. You&#x27;re not going to ask a coworker to lunch and become friends at the end of that meal. You&#x27;re going to ask that same coworker to lunch a second time, and eventually a third. And maybe you&#x27;ll be friends at the end of the fourth meal.",1402923809

I also really appreciate what Mozilla is doing and I am an otherwise happy user of FF on both desktop and mobile.<p>That said, FF memory usage (not just pdf.js) is sometimes just insane. Granted, I only have 2GB on this Linux, but FF invariably eats most of it (with just 10-20 tabs) if left running for long periods. Interestingly enough, once I restart FF and reopen the same tabs, memory usage is far lower. Memory leak? Inefficient caching? Who knows...<p>Every now and then there is a version of FF that claims to be using less memory, but in my experience the differences have been negligible. So as far I am concerned memory friendly FF is something like fast Java... I am still waiting to meet one of these beasts in the wild. :)",1402923734
7898783,comment,7895966,7897393,2,0,rayiner,,,"In American law, a covenant is best thought of as something different than a contract. They are related, but covenants are a property law concept, while contracts are their own area of law. A covenant can run with the land: someone in 1920 can put a restriction in a covenant that the owner of the property in 2014 must abide by, even if the property has changed hands many times in the interim. However, contracts only bind the parties that agree to it.<p>The distinction between the two is very relevant vis-a-vis your response to &#x27;tptacek. The terms of a lease contract are freely bargained-for between buyer and seller in the present day. Because contracts cannot bind non-parties, they will only contain provisions that at least one party considers meaningful. However, a covenant is not freely bargained-for between buyer and seller in the present day. Both the buyer and seller may be bound by provisions that both believe to be antiquated (like covenants not to sell to particular minority groups).<p>If you think a contractual term is antiquated, you&#x27;re free to bargain with the seller to have it eliminated. With a covenant provision, however, both you and the seller might be stuck with what someone wrote-in decades ago.",1402923731

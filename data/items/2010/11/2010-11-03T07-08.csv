The real work is actually making it usable with good error messages and stack traces, tools like debuggers and profilers, editor support (if you're into that sort of thing), and documentation and specs.  All of that (especially good editor support) is easily an order of magnitude more work than a parser and a compiler, and that doesn't even consider libraries you might need to write if you can't interoperate with an established language.

It's kind of crazy, and the idea of Smart Meters would eliminate the light sensor and wire part of the deal.  I would guess that WattVision and the others in this growing market are banking on the idea that 1) the electric utilities in the US move incredibly slowly, and 2) it's not just about electricity, and even if you got a smart meter for electricity, those of us who live in cold places tend to heat with natural gas and oil -- in my house our electricity use is only 20% of our total energy use (kWh of electricity compared to kWh of gas).<p>In other words, this market may be like the fax machine, which was made obsolete by the Internet almost before it was introduced three decades or so ago ... yet, they're still around :-).",1265320795

Have you ever marveled at the fact that most desktop software in 2010 still <i>defaults</i> to destroying your work? And if you do want to keep your work, it insists that you give it a name, a name which must be unique and must not contain certain characters that the computer is entirely capable of understanding, and then it asks that you choose <i>where</i> in some invisible hierarchy you want to keep it (even though the answer in almost every case is is ""where I can find it again"").

1101682,comment,1098559,1100440,0,0,chrischen,,,"> A company is not a distinct entity. A company is nothing more than a group of people acting together according to some mutually agreed upon terms.<p>People lose their individuality when participating as part of a mob. A group is a distinct entity formed by a mob. It is not like any of the individual singled out people.<p>The mob when formed acquires distinct characteristics and behaviors that distinguish it from any individual human being, who may be governed by neurons, emotions, and psychological disorders, etc. A mob can also be potentially a million times more powerful than a single human being, so how can you give such an entity the rights of an individual? Moreover, humans may like chickens and dogs, but a mob, through some freak compromise, decides to satisfy itself by breeding a half dog / chicken. Such a thing would never be concocted at the individual level, but is potentially possible at the mob level. And if it works out, it could actually be the most logical solution to satisfy the mob (an entity).<p>> But lets ignore that. Do you believe that after forming a group, you give up all constitutional rights when acting as part of the group? I.e., while the government can't censor me, it can censor papers I publish as part of my association with a larger group (NYU, my employer)?<p>That depends. If the sole purpose of you publishing your paper is to advance the factional agendas of NYU, AND if NYU acknowledges that your paper is speaking for NYU, the entity, then yes. But that doesn't mean you can't personally publish the paper. The only thing that can be potentially forbidden is NYU, using it's power to give your paper more voice and merit than it deserves. However if you are publishing it personally, then no such regulation can happen because constitutionally your rights are protected.",1265319450

It's really difficult to argue that they function in any way as a cohesive group.  Sure it can be argued that they're all profit seeking (some more than others) but the search of profits is done in such radically different ways.<p>If anything, the power of corporations has been lessening simply because of the nature of the net/web (just think how difficult it's been for even politically authoritarian societies like China to maintain a control over what people hear/see/think).  Fortune Magazine tracks the life of the average Fortune 500 company and it's been in steady decline.

Bowles (and Gintis) are trying to synthesize agent-based modeling, evolutionary game theory, behavioral economics, mainstream economics together with the other social sciences.  It's an ambitious project and absolutely necessary.<p>Come to think of it, ff there's one economist who would appeal to functional programming eccentrics and polymaths it'd be Bowles.

Maybe it was just recent malnutrition from industrialization.<p>Aside from the fact that cranial capacity has been pretty stable, it's just impossible to believe that intelligence is substantially different if you spend time studying the Talmud, or for that matter Greek philosophers.  The Greek philosophers throw people off, because everyone remembers all the science they got wrong.<p>For instance, in the Talmud, in that kind of transaction I mentioned - the half-loan half-investment deal, where one guy puts up the money and one guy puts up the work, the Talmud notes that the guy doing the work a) received a loan, and b) is working to manage the other guy's investment.  Putting two and two together, he's working for the other guy for free, just because he got a loan.  I.e., he's paying interest, and therefore this is forbidden under the prohibition against usury unless the investor pays the worker for his time.

1291375,comment,1290643,1290643,0,0,akkartik,,,"This seems like a good place to solicit feedback on my css style. (<i>Update</i>: css for my current project: <a href=""http://readwarp.com/main.css"" rel=""nofollow"">http://readwarp.com/main.css</a>)<p>I use one-line CSS selectors.[1] My CSS tends to the minimal because it's not my differentiator. Especially in the small there's a huge difference between having two screens of css vs six screens, with little extra complexity.<p>I rarely have long lines. Mostly because my styles are minimalist, but also this: selectors occur multiple times in my css. I organize my css into thematic sections. Layout. Fonts. Colors. Different 'aspects' of the same selector occur in multiple sections. Is this wrong? I haven't noticed any browser unable to handle it.<p>I do indent nested classes - but only in the layout section where the cascading matters most.<p>When I do have long lines I hard wrap and indent and use two lines. Still maximizes screen use, so I don't understand those who say 1% of selectors being on two lines defeats the purpose of one-line selectors.<p>Like jules, I don't understand the counter-argument that you can just use folding. The whole point of one-line mode is that you can see <i>attributes</i>.<p>I use folding to collapse sections of a file. To have to open and close folds at such a fine granularity strikes me as ridiculous. I would just end up having the folds always open.<p>[1] I'm a programmer first, so I guess that runs counter to JoelSutherland's generalization.",1272135003

1291302,comment,1290643,1291009,0,0,thedz,,,"But again, this comes down to knowing the tools better.  I've done probably as much CSS as the developers you mention, so I'm not completely talking out of my ass.  I just want to make sure that people realize what their editors are capable of before doing manual workflow optimizations.<p>1. With all things equal, I'd say that the developer that is able to scan a vertically aligned list of attributes can do it fast. Plus, there's no horizontal scrolling.  I'm not saying one-line scanning will be slow, but I'm arguing that with equal practice, vertical attributes will simply match what the eye is able to do more naturally.<p>2. In Textmate, you can fold all the attributes, and see a essentially a list of your selectors, with comments.<p>3. See #2.<p>I wonder if the developers you mention ever gave using symbols lists and code folding a shot before manually adjusting their workflow to mimic those features.<p>I really do believe that if they did, they wouldn't be using the one-line approach.",1272132818

It would be suicide to force the inhabitants of the jungle, who are all quite comfortable and productive as is, into cages in a zoo.

It is lightweight for a UI library and if you're already familiar with jQuery you'll feel right at home. I'm working on such an application right now.<p>I have to say that the documentation explaining how to create your own widgets is sorely lacking.  I hope to write something soon on this subject.<p>Ext JS:<p>If you're building a monster web app for intranet / corporate use with a 'desktop application' type of GUI rather than a web friendly interface, Ext JS is an extremely powerful solution.  It has ridiculously powerful widgets (the Grid for example).  Everything is event driven and class based. Making new widgets or extending core ones is easy through inheritance.<p>I've worked on 3 such applications so far and it's been great. The documentation is top notch and it's actively supported.<p>It is however VERY heavy. Both in terms of size and in terms of the markup it generates. Like I said, not for lightweight apps.

Where I live in Brooklyn I can walk 15 minutes to two different subway lines (DR!), but I can also bike entirely, take the ferry to two different stops that then either travel on a third subway line or let me bike share the remaining 15 blocks, drive to work in an emergency via 2 different bridges or a tunnel, or take the local car service either entirely on the same route (or Uber taxi) or half way to a fourth subway line. Amazingly all of these combinations result in the same 35 minute door to desk commute. The redundancy in the face of bad weather or emergencies is what really pays off in the end when you <i>must</i> get to work. If you live on a far away train line you do have public transportation, but way fewer options if something happens to take out the train (failure, snow, flooding, etc.)",1412816235

They calculated the number of jobs that a random worker (assuming everyone lives in the centroid of the Census block he resides in) can get to by transit at every 10 minute threshold, multiplied by an exponential penalty with time constant 12.5 minutes. The metropolitan areas are ranked by this score. This basically says how many jobs that you can catch the bus to, given that you reside somewhere in the metro area.<p>This analysis is more sophisticated than WalkScore’s Transit Score; this analysis uses OpenTripPlanner to simulate trips rather than just counting the number of bus lines near a given location.<p>There are many related questions that are not directly answered by this report, but I think on the top of everyone’s mind is: How many apartments can you afford in commute distance from a random job? I’m guessing San Francisco would no longer rank near the top anymore. To determine whether the transit system is good enough for car-free living, one would also want a score that takes into account trips to other destinations such as bars and grocery stores.",1412816112

8430244,comment,8429123,8429867,0,0,nathannecro,,,"Let me respond point by point.<p>> Ebola is just not a very scary disease.<p>Ebola is a frightening disease. On a psychological point, I feel like the shock of the symptoms itself is lessened due to the fact that most of the infected have dark skin. End-stage Ebola leads to the patient bleeding everywhere. Not only is the patient bleeding from obvious places like the eyes, nose, mouth, ears, penis, vagina, rectum, the whole body becomes covered with bloody petechiae (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasculitis#mediaviewer/File:Vasculitis.JPG"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasculitis#mediaviewer/File:Vas...</a>). On lighter skin, the patient&#x27;s agony is really apparent. Their bedsheets will be dripping with blood and their eyes swell up and turn a deep maroon color.<p>> Its incubation period is short and reliable, it doesn&#x27;t become infectious until symptoms display,<p>Yep.<p>> it&#x27;s not particularly infectious in the first place<p>I feel like that&#x27;s a point that doesn&#x27;t have nearly enough information. Previous outbreaks have generally been limited the virus burning its way through a small population before it can hit a major population center. Healthcare workers who are currently treating Ebola patients (who should know proper protocol), are being infected at a rate far higher than expected. (<a href=""http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/ebola/25-august-2014/en/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/ebola/25-august-2014/en/</a>)<p>> its transmission mechanisms are downright pedestrian<p>I&#x27;ll grant you that transmission by fluid is generally fairly easy to contain. However, when the patient is draining all of their bodily fluids out onto the floor, cleaning and containment becomes far harder. Not only that, there have been several incidents (at least before this current Mar 2014 outbreak) of patients infecting health workers by coughing and aerosolizing blood droplets into the mouth, nose, and eyes of their caregivers.<p>> 90% of the first world can make themselves completely safe by googling &quot;Ebola Safety&quot;<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that simple. Currently, the CDC holds training sessions for:<p>&quot;Currently licensed by a recognized professional agency to provide clinical care in some jurisdiction (e.g., hold a medical license to provide care in a state in the United States) and have recent (current or within the past 2 years) relevant experience providing direct care to patients. Participants should be licensed medical doctors (MD, DO, MBBS degrees), licensed nurses (RN, BSN, LPN, etc.), or other licensed clinical care providers (e.g., paramedics, physician assistants, and other clinical providers).&quot;<p>These training sessions solely concern biohazard safety and last for three full days. Given that the target audience has already has extensive medical training, three full days of lecture, procedure, equipment, and technical training seems far above and beyond what we should expect from a normal citizen. Let me also point out that even with training and equipment, healthcare providers are still getting sick. (<a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/hcp/safety-training-course/index.html?s_cid=cs_1344"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/hcp/safety-training-course/inde...</a>)<p>> The other 10% are homeless or hippies and will either get similarly informative pamphlets or are living in communes and won&#x27;t infect the rest of us.<p>I don&#x27;t even know where you get that 10% from. It&#x27;s also facetious to state that people &quot;living in communes&quot; &quot;won&#x27;t infect the rest of us&quot;...do people in communes live in outer space?<p>>  And even if all of that fails, we have the industry to literally give every American a hazmat suit.<p>I&#x27;d like to see how you arrived at that conclusion.<p>> Ebola may become a crisis, but it will not become a pandemic.<p>I agree. Ebola may not become a pandemic, but it will still cause great suffering to a large amount of people. I&#x27;ll also grant that until it becomes a real problem in western countries, no one will really make a move as generally, western pharma ignore diseases which don&#x27;t hold the promise of profit (see schisto). However, there is a very real chance that we can help and reduce the spread of the suffering by taking violent action _now_.<p>This goes without saying, but the one thing that anybody can do is to donate to Doctors Without Borders or any other institution trying to quell the crisis.<p><a href=""http://www.msf.org/donate"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.msf.org/donate</a>",1412815937

She is right that most people in our era were not as excited about the space program as she and I were: &quot;The reason mid-20th-century Americans were optimistic about the future wasn’t that science-fiction writers told cool stories about space travel. Science-fiction glamour in fact worked on only a small slice of the public. (Nobody else in my kindergarten was grabbing for <i>You Will Go to the Moon.</i>) People believed the future would be better than the present because they believed the present was better than the past. They constantly heard stories -- not speculative, futuristic stories but news stories, fashion stories, real-estate stories, medical stories -- that reinforced this belief. They remembered epidemics and rejoiced in vaccines and wonder drugs. They looked back on crowded urban walk-ups and appreciated neat suburban homes. They recalled ironing on sweaty summer days and celebrated air conditioning and wash-and-wear fabrics. They marveled at tiny transistor radios and dreamed of going on airplane trips.&quot;<p>The older I get, the more I like incremental progress that leads to inventions (like this Internet doohickey that lets you and me have an interesting conversation across barriers of time and place) that hardly anyone thought of in the 1960s, and which have developed from a mixture of government research projects and private investment. I don&#x27;t really care if not a lot of big-deal things happen in the next thirty years, as long as plenty of little-deal things happen like a continuation of the ongoing increases in healthy life expectancy at all ages.[1]<p>&quot;Optimistic science fiction does not create a belief in technological progress. It reflects it. Stephenson and Thiel are making a big mistake when they propose a vision of the good future that dismisses the everyday pleasures of ordinary people -- that, in short, leaves out consumers. This perspective is particularly odd coming from a fiction writer and a businessman whose professional work demonstrates a keen sense of what people will buy. People are justifiably wary of grandiose plans that impose major costs on those who won’t directly reap their benefits.&quot;<p>Hear. Hear. Let&#x27;s keep working away at making our own lives better, and our children&#x27;s lives better, and as everyone does that, the whole world&#x27;s lives will be better.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.nature.com/scientificamerican/journal/v307/n3/box/scientificamerican0912-54_BX1.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nature.com/scientificamerican/journal/v307/n3/box...</a>",1412815434

8430214,comment,8428802,8429776,0,0,mdturnerphys,,,"Some academics do work on specific problems with a known commercial application, and sometimes this research is funded by commercial entities.  The primary goal of most academics isn&#x27;t to produce commercial products, but in the course of research useful things can pop up.  Giving patent rights to grant awardees gives them the ability and incentive to commercialize offshoots of their research.  Here&#x27;s an example (I&#x27;m not a biomedical guy, so please excuse the errors):<p>Dr. Brown researches some disease.  He&#x27;s not particularly trying to come up with a treatment for it, just trying to understand it better.  He&#x27;s in academia, so he needs to publish papers to get tenure and receive grant funding.  The NIH funds his research because it&#x27;s somewhat promising and because he will do a good job educating students.  Suppose his group happens to discover a chemical compound that seems to be effective in treating this disease.  What happens next depends on whether the university can patent this discovery.<p>Before the treatment can be prescribed by doctors it needs to receive FDA approval, which requires expensive clinical trials.  Without patent protection, no one (neither the university or outside companies) is willing to fund the trials because they won&#x27;t have exclusive rights to sell the treatment once it&#x27;s approved.  Dr. Brown could work on the trials himself, but that would mean neglecting his other responsibilities.  No one has a sufficient financial incentive to make the next step, so the treatment never makes it to the market.",1412815259

Both of them did so with their first games. They built their reputation from scratch - nobody bought their games &quot;before&quot; because there were no such games.<p>Sure, but not all types of games can be made with a small and inexperienced team. Something like Minecraft, which is mostly procedural content, or a diablo like cannot be compared to a lengthy RPG.<p>> And yes, there&#x27;s nothing wrong with going out of business if you&#x27;re doing a bad job and somebody else can do it better.<p>If they made a good game, and all that&#x27;s bad about it is the drm scheme, is that really a &quot;bad job&quot;?<p>> One more thing. It might be a long shot, but if you&#x27;re interested in grid- and turn-based RPGs, maybe give Dofus or Wakfu a shot. I&#x27;m saying it&#x27;s a long shot because a) they are MMORPGs; b) they are subscription-based; c) they look cartoonish, almost anime-like. But they can get surprisingly complex and fascinating plus they are refreshing takes on seemingly played-out fantasy role-playing genre. They weren&#x27;t on Kickstarter because they were developed by an indie French company for 10 years.<p>Unfortunately, I&#x27;m pretty averse toward MMOs in general, I don&#x27;t like games over which I have no control, that could be shutdown at any moment, or change in a way I might not like in a patch (as MMO have a high tendency to constantly go through rebalance, skill changes etc). I don&#x27;t mind the anime-like stuff when the gameplay is good though, although I&#x27;ll always feel games would be better without it. I don&#x27;t mind buying and playing games on console platforms like the 3DS when I know that at some point in the future they will be emulated and thus ensure the long term archiving and playability of the games, so I&#x27;ve had experience with games like Etrian Odyssey IV, which have bad (in my opinion) graphic style, but classic gameplay that has been long forgotten on the PC. I like big dungeon mazes and having to draw my own maps, it&#x27;s a nice throwback to the era of games like Wizardry and older Might&Magic. The closest to that in the world of indies on PC is Grimrock, but the combat is real time and pretty badly done, consisting of a mumbo jumbo dance where you step back and forth in a hit and run fashion.<p>Overall, I&#x27;m willing to compromise with DRM, as long as there&#x27;s a way, be it in the present (like with most PC games) or in the future (like 3DS games) to eliminate it. This is also why I didn&#x27;t buy into the newer generations of consoles, with Moore&#x27;s law more or less coming at an end, I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ll ever be able to emulate Playstation 3 games, for example, at a decent speed. Current handhelds, while not being emulated yet, are still within the realm of possibility. For home consoles, CPU just aren&#x27;t progressing fast enough, single core performance seems like it&#x27;ll reach a standstill soon and it already takes a high end CPU to fully emulate something like the PS2, nevermind thinking about something like the Cell.<p>I don&#x27;t play a lot of games, but those I do play and enjoy tend to be games I enjoy revisiting decades later. For that matter, I&#x27;m currently replaying Wizardry 6 as I&#x27;m in a heavy dungeon crawling mood. This is also partly why, to me, it is important for the possibility of getting rid of DRMs to exist.<p>Other than not liking MMOs, I do have a varied taste in RPGs. I can go from games like Wizardry, to gridbased/tactical RPGs like Jagged Alliance 2 and Fire Emblem, to sandboxes like Skyrim. RPGs are pretty much the only genre of games I play.",1412814764

There is a serious risk that Ebola will mutate to become more infectious. It is very unlikely to become airborne (this is about as likely as pigs becoming airborne), but it could relatively easily mutate to slow down its kill speed. At the moment Ebola kills so quickly that there is little time for a patient to spread it to other people. Ebola is under huge selection pressure to slow down the disease progression in humans. We could see a strain arise that takes a month to kill you where you are asymptotically infectious for a couple of weeks. Model this sort of virus and things look far less rosy for us in the west. The more people we let Ebola infect the more likely that such a strain will arise.<p>2. Once the number of cases get very large (25,000 a day by Jan 2015 according to the CDC) this is going to start disrupting international trade as countries close their borders. We already saw the sort of recession that can result from disruptions to trade when this happened in the GFC and the Asian crisis in the 90s.

They should just be able to give me the money without knowing my account number.",1412813084

This is true, but most routers check for firmware updates anyway, so there you go. Not to mention online warranty registrations, etc. which would get you into their DB anyway.<p>2. Unlikely, unless you have a RCE bug in your DNS implementation, in which case the router is toast without the DNS querying.<p>3. One query is not &quot;traffic&quot;. It is pretty easy to distinguish between one query on boot and constant communication. Again, it is only relevant if you already have malware in your router.",1412812961

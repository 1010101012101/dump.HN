Users with large Python 2.x code bases haven&#x27;t experienced any disruption. Users who needed Python 3&#x27;s features were free to upgrade as soon as they wanted. Libraries and frameworks have gotten Python 3 support when it becomes feasible and worthwhile to do so. It may not be the fastest adoption possible, but it has been quite pain-free, and totally optional for those who have no need for it.<p>Besides, Rust should be happy to get anywhere near the number of users that Python and .NET have. That surely won&#x27;t happen until there&#x27;s a version of Rust that&#x27;s stable for more than a couple of months.<p>And what makes you think that Rust still won&#x27;t end up in a situation where some desired future functionality requires backward compatibility to be broken, regardless of how much effort they put in now?",1393282579

Something you can easily validate, even if it doesn&#x27;t feature a schema?<p>> Whether Turing-completeness is a good idea depends on how much you trust the configurers. In cases where they&#x27;re writing code anyway, you may as well have configuration be code too, among other cases.<p>It makes it much easier to misconfigure the application and, depending on how much api surface you&#x27;re going to expose, can prove to be an absolutely terrible idea in terms of maintenance (I&#x27;m looking at you, Awesome window manager). I&#x27;ll take a &quot;dumb&quot;, predictable configuration language for which I&#x27;m extremely likely to already have bindings in whatever language I&#x27;m working with than having to embed a Lua parser.

7293973,comment,7291626,7293444,1,0,grayrest,,,"In order to understand the frame of reference for Om, you really need to watch some Rich Hickey presentations [1][2] (or have a good understanding of functional programming). The first one is more relevant to your questions here, the second is just because Clojure programmers have very specific definitions of &quot;simple&quot; and &quot;easy&quot; and because it&#x27;s a good talk.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Are-We-There-Yet-Rich-Hickey"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Are-We-There-Yet-Rich-Hic...</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy</a><p>That said, on to answering your questions:<p>> If data changes, it needs to mutate, right? ...<p>Data doesn&#x27;t change in this model (see [1]). Incoming events (keyup, network request, page load) occur and your program responds to those events by producing a new, immutable set of data that you&#x27;re going to use going forward. Om apps keep one reference to the root of the data tree–Om examples use app-state as the name–which represents the official current state of the data. You can reasonably argue that swapping out app-state is changing data except that anything that had a reference to the previous root(s) still has that reference and you have to go dereference app-state to get the current value instead of having it changed out from under you.<p>> If that&#x27;s the way, how can you efficiently do updates on relatively large chunks of data? ... Or am I missing something and is it really not that bad?<p>[3] <a href=""http://eclipsesource.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/clojure-trees.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://eclipsesource.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/cl...</a><p>Clojure(script)&#x27;s data structures use structural sharing. The above picture shows inserting a single node into the middle of the structure. The red outlined nodes are the parents which need to be copy+updated, as shown on the right with all the dotted lines being shared references. The most misleading thing about the picture is that the actual cljs trees have 32 branches at each node instead of 2 or 3 so the lookup time is log32 N (basically constant [4], impl in a systems language vs classic datastructures for comparison). In your Gmail example you&#x27;d have to make ~3 new nodes.<p>[4] <a href=""https://github.com/michaelwoerister/rs-persistent-datastructures"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/michaelwoerister/rs-persistent-datastruct...</a><p>> In general, doesn&#x27;t this make model code much much more complicated?<p>It requires a different mindset and generally some helper code. In Clojure using Om it&#x27;s pretty straightforward once you&#x27;re over the initial hurdle. In javascript using Mori [5] it looks a lot like awkward Backbone with very heavy Underscore use. I&#x27;ve poked around at it and if I were going to try to adopt Mori+React for a real project I&#x27;d want to do some quality of life tweaks on Mori. Mostly setting a prototype on the Mori objects to get the feel closer to Backbone+Underscore and trying to get the data structure console output to be more useful.<p>[5] <a href=""https://github.com/swannodette/mori"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/swannodette/mori</a>",1393282516

What you&#x27;re proposing would add a tremendous layer of additional complexity. There are design, manufacturing, and maintenance costs associated with that functionality.<p>2. Comparatively few business deals end in a dispute. So in the vast majority of cases, the sensors would be a waste.<p>3. Even if a dispute occurs, there&#x27;s no guarantee the sensors will resolve it.

I asked rhetorically if it was extortion, to raise the point of why it was not extortion, which I got at in the very next sentence.<p>I got it just fine. But even if the laptop weren&#x27;t my property (by social convention or otherwise), demanding it back would not constitute extortion without <i>a threat</i>. Either way, I still don&#x27;t see the point.<p>> This really couldn&#x27;t be more handwavy<p>Sure, but I didn&#x27;t mean to &quot;prove&quot; anything to you.<p>> I&#x27;m not going anywhere abstract - I want the society that works out the best for every individual in the short, medium, and long term, as best we can approach that. If that&#x27;s where we get by treating the particular things you&#x27;ve labelled &quot;rights&quot; and respecting them with a deontological rigidness, then that&#x27;s what I want to do.<p>Cool. Read up on Murray Rothbard for example.

Yeah, I don&#x27;t have the time or energy to try and prove that either. You&#x27;ll have to go through the process of reaching enlightenment (ie. &quot;waking up&quot;) on your own anyway.<p>> Establish that hundreds of millions are enslaved<p>If 100% of the fruits of your labour are forcefully taken by someone else, you&#x27;re a slave. If 50% are forcefully taken, you&#x27;re a &quot;50% slave&quot;. Even 50% enslavement is enslavement, and so, we&#x27;re all slaves. The degree of enslavement doesn&#x27;t matter, just like it&#x27;s irrelevant whether you raped a woman for 10 minutes or three hours - it&#x27;s still rape.<p>Yeah, that still leaves you the wiggle-room of pointing out that we get to choose what we do to earn money. But that&#x27;s more like an implementation detail, and doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s unreasonable to call it enslavement. How about &quot;indirect enslavement&quot;? -That seems apt too. We get to choose what to do because the most productive slave is the one who thinks he&#x27;s free.<p>> A monopoly on legitimate initiation of violence is a great thing. Read some Hobbes and look at the violence we see in (for instance) drug turf wars, when recourse to the state is denied.<p>Care to elaborate? What&#x27;s &quot;recourse to the state&quot; in this case, and how is it denied?<p>> We need to be vigilant to keep the leviathan in check<p>The problem is that it&#x27;s impossible to keep governments in check. They&#x27;re not responsible to anyone for their actions, after all.

I started working small jobs about 5 years ago at $10/h, and now I&#x27;ve done a few jobs at $50/h.<p>First, focus less on nailing the perfect hourly rate, and more on steadily increasing your hourly rate as time goes on. Your portfolio and skills will grow constantly, as will your self-confidence.<p>Second, when you increase your hourly rate, give existing clients a bit of a discount at first. This way, you can establish yourself at a new rate with new clients, and your existing clients feel like they got in on the ground floor, instead of feeling like they had the rug pulled out from under them.<p>Finally, if there&#x27;s a job you don&#x27;t want, quote a price that would make it worth it.

You say &quot;human rights&quot;, but I&#x27;d say &quot;natural rights&quot;. To me, the former is a state-centric concept - governments supposedly &quot;protect&quot; our &quot;human rights&quot;, but somehow no one seems to figure out that governments are the biggest threat to &quot;human rights&quot; too - history is full of genocides committed by governments/rulers etc.<p>Rights are an idea meant to draw boundaries for acceptable behaviour, and natural rights is a version based on <i>reasoning</i>, starting from the axiomatic observation that we own our bodies - it&#x27;s clear they&#x27;re completely under our control, after all.<p>Ultimately, it&#x27;s all about making sense of things, through reason and evidence. That&#x27;s the only way to figure things out, and to reach logical, sound conclusions about societal issues.<p>> Because 9/10 people collectively agree that we have rights, our rights are protected and enforced.<p>This doesn&#x27;t make sense to me. What does it mean that our rights are &quot;protected and enforced&quot;? -By whom? -The government? And what does a &quot;collective agreement&quot; have to do with whether our rights are protected and enforced?<p>If you think the government protects and enforces our rights, you&#x27;re way off the mark. For starters, there&#x27;s nothing the government does that <i>prevents</i> a random stranger from hurting you, and second, contrary to what they&#x27;d have you believe, governments are the single biggest threat to you and your rights anyway.<p>> If they did not agree, your idea of rights would be regarded as a fine bit of eccentricity and people would kill you as a sacrifice to the god Asdkjhf and feel that it was not only right and just but necessary<p>Yeah. Rights are an idea. Luckily it&#x27;s an idea that the vast majority of people automatically adheres to, without ever even thinking about it. Everyone knows you &quot;can&#x27;t&quot; just go around hurting people or taking their property, but what no one knows is that there&#x27;s no reason why this shouldn&#x27;t apply to governments too.<p>> They are not an objective construct you can hold up as a shield against all wrongs.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that the idea of rights protects me in any way, shape or form. But I would like to clear up the idea, so that people would stop conflating it (along with everything else) with what governments supposedly do to benefit us when in reality they&#x27;re <i>only harmful</i>.<p>> But within the commonly held philosophical framework, a (democratic) government cannot be compared to a mafia because the government represents the will of the people while the mafia does not. But this argument can never convince you, because you have taken the axiom of individual rights to the extreme while not taking other axioms.<p>That argument can never convince me, because it makes no sense when you get to the bottom of it. It&#x27;s not about cherry-picking axioms to accept. Either something is axiomatic, or it&#x27;s not, and two separate statements can&#x27;t be contradictory and axiomatic at the same time.<p>First, taxation <i>really is extortion</i>, there&#x27;s simply no way around that. Can you consent to something that happens <i>against your will</i>? (Hint: &quot;No.&quot;). There goes your fake axiom about the will of the people. Even if you&#x27;re willing to pay taxes now (mostly because you&#x27;re in denial about the extortion), it changes nothing about the nature of taxation.

7293801,comment,7291368,7291368,1,0,AimHere,,,"One thing I was hoping this series would shed light on was an oddity in demographic voting patterns with the ratings system.<p>From my own (anecdotal) observation, there&#x27;s a class of films where the &#x27;Females 45+&#x27; rating is a big outlier in the voting, with a large proportion of &#x27;1&#x27; votes. it&#x27;s as if there&#x27;s a gang of a few hundred users consistently downvoting films who are classed by IMDB as being part of that demographic - I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a default setting that some bots or trolls have used or if there really are a bunch of cinephobic old women out there just watching and hating on films, but it did spark my curiosity as to what the pattern was. It doesn&#x27;t happen in every film, and it&#x27;s rare that you see any other demographic sticking out like this.<p>The best examples are critically acclaimed films with low voter counts.

7293746,comment,7292503,7292503,7,0,d0,,,"I know this is getting a lot of fanfare but let us apply four major costly problems I&#x27;m having with the CLR/Framework at the moment:<p>1. Microsoft.Build.Tasks (the bit that has been screwing with me all day) contains static sealed classes with nothing in them. I thought this was a reference source rather than a source of empty interfaces and empty implementations? Still having to resort to reflector to find out what is going on. Problem not solved.<p>2. So, ReaderWriterLockSlim has a bug in it with respect to low CPU allocation in virtual machines where 20 concurrent threads accessing a locked object at the point of write cause the spin lock in the implementation to thrash and up blows a race condition taking out the process. I can actually see where the bug is now. Where do I submit this bug, bear in mind I can actually recreate it? I phoned up our MSDN rep - they said raise it on Connect. There isn&#x27;t a place for it on Connect. Phone up generic paid support, three levels of technical staff bounce me around for a week. as a PAID UP GOLD PARTNER, this sucks. If you open your source, track bugs openly too. Problem not solved.<p>3. This is only the core framework. We really need the entire lot including all dependencies and external tools. There aren&#x27;t any symbols on symbol server or this for VSTO or Sharepoint for example? What we do get is another black box somewhere in the system that we can&#x27;t inspect or poke inside even though it&#x27;s a wrapper for a COM API or a product API. Problem not solved.<p>4. Does Rosyln/next MSBuild support parallel compilation? Being tied to a single compilation core on a VS2013 build means we have 8 core Xeons sitting there doing nothing. Our only hope of speeding this up is cranking up to high end i7 to get one core with crazy integer performance. 20 minute sit down compiles are too much these days. <a href=""http://xkcd.com/303/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://xkcd.com/303/</a><p>I understand this is progress and Roslyn is cool and all that, but what does it deliver for every day users of the CLR/Framework? It doesn&#x27;t really make our day much easier. In fact stuff that really improves developers&#x27; lives has stopped appearing completely and instead we get tedious reengineering projects and new features designed only to lock us further into the system (VS online+sign in anyone?)<p>Also how does this compare to say LLVM/Clang?<p>I imagine this semantic compilation stuff will make some static analysis stuff easier and stamp on the toes of Coverity etc but that&#x27;s about it.<p>Edit: sorry if this is purely a content-free rant and unpopular but after 12 years of this crap from Microsoft, I want to see new wheels, not the same ones reinvented and remarketed. Developers are lapping up this crap constantly as if it&#x27;s as good as it gets. We need some REAL CHANGE towards openness and consistency and to ask the community and users what they want rather than telling us what we need.",1393279668

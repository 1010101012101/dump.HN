And then I leave and have free time, not being stressed because I should be working.<p>This obviously doesn&#x27;t apply to you, but you can simulate it to a certain extent. Pick the days and times that are &#x27;productive&#x27; time. Don&#x27;t let weekends blur into weeks (if you want to do a 6 day week that&#x27;s your call, but don&#x27;t do a 7 - that way madness lies). Pick the hours in the day that are useful time, and then spend the rest in a bar, watching TV, whatever. And if at all possible, pick a place that&#x27;s not your normal chilling out place to work in. It can be bottom of the garden, different room in the house, coffee shop, whatever.<p>Use all that to separate screwing around time (reading about Magpies on wikipedia, fiddling with Text Editor colour scheme) from useful productive time.",1424296752

We have a message that is challenging to communicate clearly and succinctly. This is something we will continue to iterate on and test in the early stages.<p>We think the returns are excellent, &quot;on an APR basis&quot; as you said, which is another thing we need to communicate better. A 10% return in 6 months is kind of the same as a 5% return in 3 months, both of which are 20% in a year which is great. We don&#x27;t think APR really captures this idea correctly though and may want to instead come up with some similar metric that will allow you to better compare the offerings.<p>We also need to better communicate the backers&#x27; responsibilities in that promoting isn&#x27;t exactly optional. This is a similar transaction as buying goods on Ali Baba then putting them up for sale on Amazon and Ebay.

The premise of the thread is that there has never been a truly Marxist state; personally I&#x27;ve not seen any evidence for a truly communist one either (but admit my knowledge is relatively weak). Most states called communist appear to be communist dictatorships and this is where this aphorism fits rather well.<p>><i>Why do you give Intellectual or personal superiority to communist?</i> //<p>Probably the same reason you consider it to be superiority I&#x27;m claiming!? State capitalism and so-called Communist Dictatorships are not in the least communist (in the sense reviewed here, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_society"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_society</a>).<p>><i>Communist forces OTHERS to work for free</i> //<p>That&#x27;s dictatorship. It was a corollary to the point I was making. Unless everyone is committed  to the communist ideal it seems it _cannot_ work - one rogue element (who wishes to have more power) will break the classless society. Whilst on the contrary in capitalism rogue elements that stand against, for example, exploitation of workers - choosing to see them as people rather than merely a means to profit - helps to calm the revolts that would otherwise inevitably come to the fore.<p>It&#x27;s like being a violent person amongst extreme pacifists - the violence will win easily. In the converse situation the pacifist merely helps to extend the reign of violence.<p>Communism requires the consideration that all men deserve to be treated as though they are equal in worth. Capitalism, in full, requires that people be treated as a commodity to be exploited. Capitalism has morals purposefully ignored; communism has them as a central axiom. Sure you can casts capitalistic versions of a state in which selling people and exploitative wage setting is outlawed (&quot;Western Capitalism&quot; tends towards this though both negative aspects exist within it of course), for example, but you&#x27;re moving away from pure capitalism then by allowing workers &quot;ownership&quot; of their own time and resources.",1424296346

Most of them were negative. Overall, placebos were 82 percent as effective as the drugs, as measured by the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D), a widely used score of symptoms of depression. The average difference between drug and placebo was only 1.8 points on the HAM-D, a difference that, while statistically significant, was clinically meaningless. The results were much the same for all six drugs: they were all equally unimpressive. Yet because the positive studies were extensively publicized, while the negative ones were hidden, the public and the medical profession came to believe that these drugs were highly effective antidepressants.<p>Kirsch was also struck by another unexpected finding. In his earlier study and in work by others, he observed that even treatments that were not considered to be antidepressants—such as synthetic thyroid hormone, opiates, sedatives, stimulants, and some herbal remedies—were as effective as antidepressants in alleviating the symptoms of depression. Kirsch writes, “When administered as antidepressants, drugs that increase, decrease or have no effect on serotonin all relieve depression to about the same degree.” What all these “effective” drugs had in common was that they produced side effects, which participating patients had been told they might experience.&quot;",1424295599

They have storage flexibility, so they can allocate metadata to authenticators and nonces. The fact that sector-level crypto can&#x27;t do this means that the &quot;state of the art&quot; in efficient sector crypto is essentially unauthenticated ECB mode.<p>2. They&#x27;re message-aware, so they can apply authentication at meaningful boundaries; a block crypto device is essentially a simulated hard disk, and so it doesn&#x27;t know where files begin and end.<p>3. Being message-aware, they can protect files at a better level of granularity than &quot;all or nothing&quot;, which for instance is the security failure that made it so easy for the FBI to convict Ross Ulbricht for Silk Road.<p>A lot of concerns about filesystem crypto stem from the fact that filesystem crypto precedes sector-level crypto, and most of it was designed (or has designs tracing to) the 1990s. What people who don&#x27;t spend a lot of time studying crypto should remember is that nobody knew how to encrypt <i>anything</i> in the 1990s. It was a unique and weird time, where there was a lot of demand and interest in crypto, but not enough knowledge to supply crypto effectively.<p>So we should be careful about judging filesystem crypto by the standards of the 1990s.",1424294370

If you want to make money off of that, provide some enterprisey tools for people to verify previously stamped documents or other value-add services not related to the core offering.

Can your certificates be forged? A verifiable and un-forgeable certificate would be valuable. Or perhaps I associate a BTC wallet id with a small amount of money in it and that&#x27;s part of the overall document hash too. So when I want to prove I hashed it, I send a tiny fraction of a bitcoin from that wallet (and it could be an unpredictable fraction, to serve as a one time PIN).

Your pricing says $29 / month. Your FAQ talks about &quot;How much does it cost?
Owlsend application charges a flat fee of $29 upto 10,000 subscribers, $49 for upto 50,000 subscribers and $79 for upto 100,000 subscribers. You can send unlimited bulk emails with Owlsend every month. Amazon SES costs $1 per 10,000 emails sent.&quot;<p>So is it $29 + $1 for that first 10000 emails? If not, why are you talking about SES and how much SES costs? SES [costs] should be a non factor and not even mentioned.<p>EDIT: In the Pricing section it says &quot;Send Unlimited Emails to 10,000 Subscribers&quot; again, am I still paying $1 per 10,000 emails above the $29 / month just to use your interface?",1424293444

9070900,comment,9069143,9070374,0,0,cpwatson,,,"From my experience Little&#x27;s law is typically used to quantify the number of users in the system, a measure of concurrency.  For the purpose of our tools we leverage the calculation to provide insight on &quot;offered load&quot; or the time spent w/in the service for a given interval. We do have a challenge in that many of our downstream dependencies are called concurrently.  At the current time this prevents us from easily decomposing the demand in a service cleanly among it&#x27;s dependencies.  Some of this has to do with our transaction tracing framework and the granularity at which we require call behavior to be easily time-ordered.  We believe we can solve this overtime with an improved framework.
In the case of Mogul we leverage the demand calculation to understand who is the largest contributor, pointing us in the direction of possible optimization.  If we are using the utility to triage an issue we typically find that an increase in the demand or offered load within the problematic dependency tends to easily correlate with the demand of the calling service.  I think we are just at the beginning of leveraging this data in a more effective manner, and getting away from having eyeballs look at a dashboard is definitely a goal.",1424293260
9070899,comment,9070409,9070409,0,0,DenisM,,,"Excellent idea!<p>- I&#x27;m not sure about E1.50 price, I think $0.99 would be easier to swallow, psychologically. I understand you have the transaction cost weighing on you, so maybe sell packs of 5 signatures for $4.95? This also gives you ability to run promotions with discounted signature packs.<p>- Alternatively a monthly subscription could be interesting as well. Imagine if I&#x27;m writing a novel, I might want to keep signing different copies as I go along many times per day, but then rewrite them anyway as I&#x27;m not yet satisfied.  It would be nice if you shipped a simple text editor that saves all local copies of the work as it&#x27;s modified, together with persons&#x27;s name and your timestamp / signature, as a proof of concept. You could be delaying or batching transactions to offset the bitcoin tx cost.<p>- I liked the easy drag and drop for a picture, but sadly I have to put my signature into the picture which takes away all of the drag-drop convenience. It would be more convenient if it worked by me drag-dropping the picture and then typing in free-form text into your web site, such as &quot;Copyright (c) DenisM aka foo@bar.com&quot;, and then you hashing (picture + signature), detailing the procedure in the PDF.<p>- In a weird way contradicting the convenience aspect I just asked for, I would prefer to give you my hash of the document rather than document itself. I may be afraid of the content leaking before I am ready to release it myself. It&#x27;s an easy fix for you - add a separate tab where instead of dropping the document I can paste in the hash myself.<p>Keep up the good work!",1424293244

There's not a doubt in my mind that my resume's been thrown in the ""Non-programming programmer"" pile due to my stage fright at least once.

2385884,comment,2385424,2385869,33,0,tptacek,,,"No, you've missed a key risk: (4) that the prospective employer continues to get resumes from people even after ""filling"" the position and decides on T+89 that you're great, but they can do even better.<p>During the 90 day contract, both you and the employer must technically still be ""looking"" (the company still has an FT headcount to fill, and the dev still doesn't have a job). But the company is inherently better positioned to deal with the uncertainty: companies hire many people simultaneously, and keeping a req open costs them nothing. Individuals, on the other hand, have a very hard time conducting a serious job search and doing their 100% on a full-time job simultaneously.<p>That is not actually a risk in the FT dev model, where the incentives are structured differently; it is instead very much more like the ""up or out!"" model of the Big 4 accounting firms or investment banks: you got the shot at the gig, now work your ass off to make sure you can keep it!<p>If you are a friend of mine and you are staring down the barrel of one of these ""contract-to-hire"" offers, take my advice: turn it down. We've been hiring nonstop for the past couple years, including for dev, and it is ludicrously, insanely good to hire good people.

The interviews went well, and the recruiter called today to say that things are moving to the ""compensation committee"" stage. I accepted my first (and to date, only) job offer several years back without any negotiations, so I have no experience negotiating whatsoever.<p>What struck me as weird was that the recruiter wanted me to fill out a data sheet listing my salary, previous salary increase, previous bonuses, expected future bonuses, all stock/options grant info, etc. Is this the norm? My friends who were hired straight out of school naturally didn't have to fill this out, though some of my friends say the salary inquiries are normal when applying to new jobs.<p>Will filling this out impact the negotiations at all?

2385848,comment,2385424,2385790,20,0,tptacek,,,"Virtually all employment in the US is at will, meaning you are continually on ""probation"". The difference between a contractor and an FT is that the contractor is 1099'd, pays both halves of FICA taxes, and isn't provided health insurance; more importantly, when the employer is as overt about the issue as ""not hiring you full time"", there's no implied social contract or norm ensuring you'll even end up getting the job.<p>Contractors make <i>significantly</i> more money than full time devs partly for this reason. They're compensated for shouldering the risk of keeping a full book of work. Getting a good developer to work as a contractor for what will eventually be their FT wage is almost kind of a scam.<p>This is a simple, practical issue. You're Sam, a developer with 5 years experience. You have a choice between two roughly equal jobs. One prospective employer offers you a full time job tomorrow; the other offers you a 3 month auditioning contract. Which offer do you pick?",1301460273
2385847,comment,2384018,2384488,3,0,mak120,,,"I interviewed with them recently (got through phone interviews and am waiting for a visa for my onsite interview), and I never got any trick/puzzle questions that need no programming to solve. I did get questions about simple CS concepts and had to write code for programming problems on a shared google doc. Nothing any ordinary CS graduate wouldn't know. I made mistakes, which my interviewers always guided me to correct. They don't expect you to write a flawless binary search -  they know you'll make mistakes. What they want to see is how you think and how you code, and how you recover from mistakes. Also, that you know what binary search is in the first place.<p>That was my first interview, and they said at first it was going to be a coding interview. My next interview was a design interview. We talked at length about designing a simple web application, which got increasingly sophisticated as we progressed. But my interviewer did ask me to write code to demonstrate what I had in mind from time to time and I had to code up some small methods and classes to show him. No puzzles. No CS theory or abstract problems. Just what I would do if I were building a real world application.<p>Oh, and they asked about what projects I had worked on both interviews.<p>I have been an interviewer in the place where I work currently, and I <i>always</i> asked candidates to write code. Some guys here ask puzzles, but I don't like that. Puzzles  \n(like how to find you who's lying in an island on people or something) don't really show anything in an interview situation. But a short programming problem, demonstrating the ability to identify and use a well known data structure or algorithm, or to use good sense and understanding to design a solution to a problem does go a long way to show that a candidate can actually code and get stuff done. I've seen lots of bad candidates impress us with their knowledge of tech buzzwords, past projects in their CV and even talking about design patterns, but fail miserably when asked specific questions or writing even the simplest amount of code.<p>But if someone asks me about trains and birds, I would seriously reconsider working there",1301460252

You only need to mess around with header files if it will be used elsewhere.<p>For lisp, you still need the function name and argument names (don't you? or is it common to access them as a list, with cddr etc?) - so it seems the saving is only in the type of return value and types of parameters. That is extra typing, but it doesn't seem much more - I guess it may make a difference at the margin.  But if so, this is just dynamic typing. You still choose argument names and a function name.<p>Or is it more a cultural, idiomatic thing, of what's customary in a language? Which is the author's point, of Sapir-Whorf. I think of course you'll tend to do what's accepted in a language, what's easiest, what its strengths are. But it's also possible to cross-use idioms. It may be a little awkward, but if it really is right idiom for that specific task, it should help.<p>Or it might be another kind of cultural factor: that the author's C++ is work code, seen by other people (or more likely to be), and so function and argument names need to be fretted over, for others to understand (and also not criticize) them. I'm just guessing here. Why fret over C++ names, but not lisp names?",1301459867

If so, then the answer to why the grade was reduced, is easy: the student did not follow instructions.<p>Not long ago, I spent a number of years teaching a 4th-semester university programming class. I required my students to follow a <i>relatively</i> detailed (for a class, anyway) set of coding standards. These standards were not necessarily the best they could have been; however, I made no apology for them, because I was trying to help my students learn to build software within externally imposed constraints.<p>After all, anyone who works on a sizable software project -- other than the person running the project -- will almost certainly have to adhere to standards they did not write. There is a good chance that some of these will be standards they are not fond of. That's just the way large projects are. And giving students practice in dealing with this, is, I think, a good goal for a software development curriculum to have.<p>So, is it reasonable to downgrade a student's work severely for including a global variable?

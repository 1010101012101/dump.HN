174678,comment,174575,174646,0,0,jrockway,,,"> I share his suspicion of most XP techniques.<p>Well, he is suspicious because he assumes people using XP are programmers.  That's not correct.<p>The idea behind XP is to get somewhat usable code out of non-programmers.  Why companies don't just fire people that can't program, I'll never know... but XP does seem to work.  Instead of getting unmaintainable, untested, half-working garbage, you get unmaintainable, tested, two-thirds working garbage.<p>Oh yeah, now I remember why these programmers exist.  Companies seem to value quantity over quality of programmers.  That way people can be sick or go on vacation and you'll still get your two-thirds-working code.  BRILLANT!",1209272347

174676,comment,174410,174610,0,0,scw,,,">The Internet-connected population watches roughly a trillion hours of TV a year. That's about five times the size of the annual U.S. consumption. One per cent of that  is 10,000 Wikipedia projects per year worth of participation.<p>He switched context from discussing the US-only consumption to total global television consumption.  It seems worth thinking about the implications of this change even if the numbers are inaccurate.",1209272162

174673,comment,174393,174620,0,0,phaedrus,,,"Optimization most definitely <i>is</i> science - if done right, anyhow.  You conduct observations (benchmarks) and form a hypothesis about what will improve speed/memory usage.  You make the changes and conduct experiments to see if your hypothesis was correct.  You draw conclusions based on the results and if your hypothesis was wrong, you change your hypothesis and try again.<p>Is optimization not science?<p>Edit:  But yeah, design IMO will always be art as much as science.",1209271560
174672,comment,174581,174649,0,0,neilc,,,"This reminds me of the need for math in the sciences and engineering vs. the way math is studied at a typical math department. You need to know how to <i>use</i> calculus and differential equations to be an engineer, but you need to understand the fundamental principles underlying those techniques to a much greater degree as a math major (and as a math graduate student, even more so).",1209271052

174665,comment,174410,174632,0,0,zasz,,,"Along this line: when people say, ""I would <x>, but I don't have the time"" (where <x> is some creative, interesting thing), usually one can substitute the word ""Vespene gas"" for ""time"" in their statement, and learn a lot more about them: they are essentially asserting that they are too Vespene gas depleted to <x>.<p>I don't understand this post. If you substitute a word that's essentially the same, that's a synonym and you therefore gain no meaning. And it makes no sense to say people are essentially asserting something when you put an assertion in their mouths.<p>I think it's more complicated than energy and time; generally, I don't think people actually like <x> enough to want to invest some time and energy or Vespene gas in it. I just went to an energy efficiency event today. 45 people had signed up and only 27 showed up to install energy-efficient things today. It would have taken 5 hours and very little energy. I think a lack of interest, causing a lack of commitment, explains it better.",1209269613

174663,comment,174138,174138,0,0,retrogradeorbit,,,"It reminds me of something I read in, I think it was, Peopleware (Or it might have been Mythical Man Month). That software by its very nature requires the programme to be perfect or it won't work, and human beings are imperfect and have a hard time adjusting to the demands of trying to be perfect. In this regard there are _no_ perfect programmers. A perfect programmer is one who never makes a single mistake or bug, ever, on any project, and every piece of code works perfectly, first time, and forever. By our very nature we are imperfect.",1209269496

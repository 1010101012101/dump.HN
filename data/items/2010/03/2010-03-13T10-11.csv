1188787,comment,1180698,1181644,0,0,abalashov,,,"Another important point:  simply by virtue of having insurance of <i>some</i> description, you will get different pricing than if you're billed directly as an individual.  That's because insurers pay the claim and then settle it with the policyholder, so the healthcare providers don't factor in the same delinquency / nonpayment risk that they apply to people who just walk in off the street and presumably pay in cash.  You may get invoiced 2-2.5x more for the same procedure than you would if the billing were going through some kind of policy, which is in itself significant, never mind the limits, deductible or possibility of rescission.",1268477499

The lack of a proper rich client - dynamically updating index in particular - for MSDN content in VS2010, so far, is disturbing to me - I generally find APIs using the index followed by contextual tree navigation, both of which don't work nearly as well in web apps.",1268477263

1188782,comment,1187875,1188047,0,0,tolmasky,,,"I don't feel this is true at all. I think people start to question reality when the plot is weak or when the object that in unrealistic is tied to the plot in a significant way.<p>I've never sat through Back to the Future and seen a nerd say ""but what exactly does a flux capacitor do in order to enable time travel, this movie is so unrealistic!"". I think that as long as a minimal effort is given to explain away these points it is satisfactory to most people as long as those points are not essential to the movie: the physics of time travel is not essential to the story of Back to the Future.<p>However, the more important to the movie, the more time must be spent. Cloning dinosaurs, and specifically how they clone dinosaurs, was pretty important to Jurassic Park. Hence, more effort was placed in explaining this to the audience (they're all girl dinosaurs, fossilized dna, need frog dna, etc etc). This is significantly more involved than ""oh we have a flux capacitor for that"" explanation. Both are perfectly fine though, since they match their necessity to the movie.<p>I personally felt that Avatar succeeded at this level of explanation. Aside from ""unobtanium"" somehow making it past the first edit of the script, the technological/biological stuff was fine: Unoriginal? Yes. Uncomfortably unrealistic? No.<p>However, I think absolutely everything else about that movie was pretty subpar. The plot was really uninspired. Its sad, so much gloss on top of such an empty story. On top of that, I really was not that impressed with the graphics. I'm sure plenty of people will tell me I don't know what I'm talking about, but when I'm 70 years old and someone asks me, visual effects-wise, what was the highlight of my movie going career, I'm going to say seeing the brachiosaur in Jurassic Park, and probably won't even remember Avatar.",1268477096

Imperfect as much of proposed legislation is, it's also thoroughly researched, argued over, picked apart, dissected, analyzed and so on. Often with a partisan tilt. The system for coming up with legislation is quite adversarial. But it's not based on 'hunches and intuition'.<p><i>we should implement more than one approach</i><p>A little principle of 'equality before the law' might really get in the way here.<p>The process of writing and designing software is a relatively new discipline and one in which significant, high-impact insights are being made and will continue to be made. Given these bright flashes of success, the temptation to apply software methodology to entirely unrelated fields ranging from law to personal relationships is very high. It's best resisted, since it's usually stupid. At a minimum, before applying it, ask yourself 'how is this not like software' rather than starting with 'how is this like software'.",1268476978

The conflict in the Robot books isn't about ""positronic brains,"" it's about robotic interactions with humanity. The science being employed is sociology.<p>To put it another way—the initial state of the universe when the book starts can be anything you like, with any <i>rules</i> you like. SF is just a strict dedication setting up those rules and following them wherever they may lead. (""Hard"" sci-fi additionally requires that those rules be a superset of the rules of our own universe.)",1268476749

1188774,comment,1186043,1188538,0,0,ErrantX,,,"> There is lots of great stuff that doesn't get taught. It's absurd to call that ""banned""<p>There is implication in the story (and I realise there is no further evidence than what is presented there) that it's not a case of it simply not being taught - but that they are actively put on a list of ""material not allowed"". <i>that</i> is the distinction.<p>You need to read what was written:<p><i>Recently, the principal and school teacher council released a (very long) list of books we're not allowed to read</i><p><i>I would be in so much trouble if I got caught</i><p><i>But is what I'm doing wrong because parents and teachers don't know about it and might not like it, or is it a good thing because I am starting appreciation of the classics and truly good novels</i><p>I find it sad that, if true, a kid is having to provide this material - and is worried that lending books to people is somehow <i>wrong</i>!<p>> No one is stopping those kids from getting those books.<p>That's a little naive. If a kid requested or suggested the book for the school library and it was refused on the grounds it had been banned; how is that a <i>good</i> thing? If the story is true (and again I realise it can't be fully verified) then it appears the service was popular.. indicating that the non-provision of that material was actually stopping kids from getting the books as part of their normal routine.<p>The implicit suggestion by a school that actively bans a book is that there is something wrong with it. I can't see how you can legitimately say that about, say, His Dark Materials....",1268476476

So why not buy a cheap camcorder, get a friend to be the passenger/cameraman, go record an instance of it actually happening and put it on YouTube?  It would be on every news channel in the country the next day and Toyota would be forced to respond directly.<p>In fact, if I had the kind of money Woz did and thought there was a real danger here, I'd just buy a camera that installed in the headliner and recorded everything that was happening while the car was on at all times, so that I could easily catch the bug when it occurred.",1268476454

My real objection is that stoics (and many others) rationalize the current state of things as good. The alternative is to recognize that there are still a lot of big problems humanity needs to solve.<p>I consider the eradication of smallpox the second greatest accomplishment of humanity so far. The first is the green revolution, headed by Norman Borlaug. His new strains of crops saved about a billion lives in the 20th century.<p>With regards to earthquakes: Just because we can't solve a problem doesn't mean it's not a problem. I'm not offering a solution, just pointing out that earthquakes kill people. I don't want people to die, so that makes earthquakes bad in my book. It also makes disease, aging, and lots of other things bad. Is does not imply ought.",1268475366

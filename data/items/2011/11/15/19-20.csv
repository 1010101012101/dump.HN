",http://heuristx.com/posts/58-is-the-supply-and-demand-crisis-for-ror-talent-becoming-a-deal-breaker-for-companies,"The demand for Ruby on Rails talent has sky rocketed and it's very difficult to find talent. If you disagree, I'll pay you $5,000 dollars a head. For start-ups and corporations willing to embrace the technology, the decision to use RoR can be critical.<p>I began approaching well known Rails programmers via email the other day for my education technology company, asking if they knew of anyone interested in a job and as usual, I received a bunch of emails from people ""frustrated and pist off.""<p>My email went to the tune of: ""Hello, was wondering if perhaps you know of anyone interested in working with a Rails based education technology company in Chicago. We're offering a really great package for both junior and senior level developers.""<p>If companies are gridlocked and can't build the capabilities needed to innovate because they can't find Rails developers, why should companies continue to use it? I know of more than a dozen well funded start-ups who've actually decided not to use Ruby on Rails because of inability to find talent.<p>You would think those truly concerned with the adoption of the technology at industry would care a little more about companies looking to make hires and grow. I feel like this selfishness and willingness to embarrass companies trying to find talent is inconsistent with the principals of open source software, which thrive contingent upon their widespread adoption.<p>Even more concerning, it's not like we're offering chump-change for the position. We're actually coming in well above market rate, well over 100k, totally respecting the authority. So to those I've offended with a casual email requesting your help, please explain to me how businesses should proceed in their decision to adopt RoR and build out their capabilities.",1321387182

Consider the following thought experiment:<p>I have 100 people, and 6 HIV infections.  10 of the people are gay men, and 3 of them are infected.  2 of the people are female prostitutes and both of them are infected.<p>The general population has a 6% infection rate.  The gay men have a 50% infection rate and account for 50% of the infections.  The prostitutes have a 100% infection rate and account for 33% of the infections.<p>The exclusion of which group improves the resulting donor pool more?<p>If we exclude the men, we are left with 3 infections / 90 people = 3.3%.  If we exclude the prostitutes, we are left with 4 infections / 98 people = 4.1%.<p>Even though the prostitutes have a much higher rate of infection than the gay men, excluding the men helps the final result more because they account for more of the overall infections.",1321385547

Most websites provide some information (.info), allow some communication (.net), are associated with some organisation (.org), and maybe collect money in some way (.com). Thus these base names are mere noise words, creating confusion for users trying to guess the most appropriate one.<p>2) The base names lead to unwanted duplications, overlaps and mis-directions of the real domain names and the unnecessary disputes arising from this. Simply stated, the base names destroy the uniqueness of the real domain names. This is sheer folly.<p>3) Lest someone objects that there will not be enough domain names to go round, most main domain names can be differentiated more effectively and appropriately by addition of three or more letters of the domain buyer's own choice.<p>The Implementation<p>It is suggested that all existing domain names are converted to the new format protocol.uniquename by simple deletion of the dot before the base name. Example: www.somedomain.eu -> www.somedomaineu<p>This means that legacy compatibility of networks and browsers can be ensured with a minor parsing change and those who have grown attached to their base name (perhaps a geographical one which does carry some information) will get to keep it in this form.<p>No re-registration or change of any kind of the existing domains is necessary.<p>Summary of The Benefits:<p>1) Neat resolution of the major non-uniqueness problems plaguing unnecessarily the existing domain name addressing.<p>2) The changeover can be accomplished simply and with a minimal disruption, ensuring legacy compatibility.<p>3) New domain name creators become empowered to create many new unique and relevant names for themselves.",1321384876

Anyone who has a hard time doing so should not be using credit cards.<p>There are three reasons why I use my credit card so much (in order of importance to me):<p>1: It makes my finances much, much easier to manage.  If I were using a debit card, I would have to track every transaction to the penny throughout the month in order to avoid overdrafts.  Instead, I just keep a rough mental tally of my expenditures to make sure that I'm not living beyond my means.  If my spending happens to get front-loaded on any particular month, no big deal: I've got another paycheck coming before the bill is due at the end of the month.  With a debit card, I would have to manage my spending by pay period (twice a month) rather than billing cycle (once a month).  Also, if I <i>did</i> happen to spend a little bit too much by accident, I'm looking at a few dollars (possibly even just a few cents) in finance charges, as opposed to a $20+ overdraft fee on <i>every</i> subsequent transaction.<p>2: I have a rewards credit card, so everything I buy gets me points.  If you aren't using a rewards credit card, you're helping to pay for my rewards: the credit card companies generally charge the merchants higher transaction fees for purchases made with rewards cards (otherwise they would lose money on people like me who don't carry a balance).  Merchants pass those costs on to customers by raising prices slightly.  If you're not using a rewards card, you're paying those higher prices without reaping the benefits.  Some merchants charge lower prices for cash, in which case I will usually pay cash because the savings are worth more than the points.<p>3: Because I pay my balance in full each month, I'm getting an interest-free loan from my bank each month.  That money sits in my bank account accruing interest for anywhere from 1 to 30 days (depending on when I make the purchase).  With interest rates as low as they currently are, I'm only making a few cents each month this way, but that's still money I wouldn't otherwise have.<p>How many of these reasons would also apply in Europe?  I know that #1 does, but what about #2 and #3?  There are plenty of reasons for <i>not</i> using credit cards, which I didn't really get into, but are there reasons that apply in Europe which don't apply in the US?",1321384533
3239656,comment,3237261,3239483,1,0,billpatrianakos,,,"Unless I'm mistaken you're talking opinions. I'm speaking not only from experience but from facts gathered through working with local and federal agencies and public and private researchers and the studies all support what I said.<p>I might have used some blunt language but it's true. It doesn't matter how kids are brought up. It's a fact of nature that adolescents are hard wired to rebel against whatever they were taught at home. They test their upbringing and usually come out the other end believing what they were taught to begin with plus or minus a few beliefs but in the middle they almost always try to see what's up for themselves. You'd be surprised how many kids who grew up in wonderful moral families end up abusing or addicted to drugs. The founder of the organization Im part of is a retired Chicago PD officer with a number of degrees in education. He brought his son up in a well off upper-middle class neighborhood with good schools and strong morals. This family might as well have the Brady Bunch. But his son got mixed in with heroin and died after a long struggle with addiction. This was exactly the type of kid you say won't use.<p>See, that's the big problem. Everyone thinks its a moral failing and they take the attitude that it's the neighbor's kid but never mine until it happens to you. There are so so many families this has happened to and their afraid to warn others for fear of being labelled bad parents who didn't provide a solid moral ethic to pass down to their kid(s).<p>I am a smoker and I'm happy to admit that others done want to breathe in my second hand smoke. I'll also give you the rule on smoking 15 feet away from buildings is a good one too. But there's a fine line where legislation doesn't need to go. Banning it in public altogether is just ridiculous. We're all adults. We can say something if we want a smoker to leave the middle of the street. I mean cigarettes are legal and public areas are public. Leave the poor smokers alone when they're not bothering you. You can also choose to walk away. I mean, we not do it for 5 minutes at a time. You won't get cancer in those minutes. Please don't take my freedom away from me. What if I don't want your crying child or strong perfume or breast feedi near me? I'm not going to make it illegal because it inconveniences me.<p>But what really bothered me about that last paragraph was how you called it ""drug addict"" smoke. Yes, they are addicts technically but using those words in a derogatory way like that just perpetuates the stigma carried by addicts. We aren't sun-humans, bottom feeders, or somehow just some class of undesirables. We're your friends, neighbors, and family and we need help. Most of us are incredibly intelligent and have a lot to offer society if we could just get the help we need. I know how bad the behavior of an addict can be because I am one but all of deserve a chance to get better before being written off.",1321384532

Now granted it is a generalization and not everyone fits the mold but measured as a whole people associate themselves with their cast in whatever social structure they interact in.

The reason I was enjoying Quora was its lack of explicit gameified geegaws -- versus StackOverflow (and to a lesser extent the whole StackExchange federation). SO has become less and less useful, if you've got a novel and/or slightly abstract or subjective query, because everyone is playing for points, including moderators. It leads to a Pavlovian house style, favoring novice questions with circumlocutious answers, with terse rebukes and heavy-handed moderation for everything else.<p>I appreciate SO's focus but only inasmuch as it produces something I can use. I still use it frequently as the majority of ""duh, what module?"" sort of questions have been answered there already.<p>Quora wadn't about that, though; I found the process of socially-networked collaborative question-answering to be as valuable as the answer... E.g. Answers that were 80% there would frequently contain clues to new relevant questions; if people are trying to ""win"" I m afraid that horizontal exploration of Quora's topics won't be as fun or accessible.<p>In fact I think it will be less fun in general, and the likely inference that less fun leads to less Quora use (and therefore less $)doesn't require rocket-science-grade reasoning.<p>I am sure enough people love this kind of game enough such that they'll stay afloat even if the Quora game is every bit as unpleasant as I might anticipate -- but in my personal expert opinion, that'd be weak.",1321384079

Specifically, why do you say that ""the cost to lay cable in the US is higher by several orders of magnitude?"" Is there a valid reason for why US prices are so much higher, and are they really?<p>In terms of areas with higher population density having different prices -- I'm not sure that it's entirely true that they can't do that, since here in Canada it's fairly standard practice to vary prices for Internet service by postal code.",1236787115

The biggest problem we faced was that my partner had just gotten into a relationship which requires almost as much time as a new venture. So while I was envisioning 10 hour work days, he was envisioning days filled with several  breaks to catch up with his girlfriend and/or his work hours were based around her schedule. This made it extremely hard for me to focus and set time for us to work together.<p>With that said, I would add to the list of questions - What other outside relationships will you need to spend significant time on and how will this affect our work days/schedule?",1236787058

We were friends outside the company, but nobody in the world would say the work relationship was friendly. Al was like Matthew Broderick's character in ""Glory""; whatever terms you were on with him before the company --- and Al and I were peers --- at SNI, Al was in charge. I got yelled at a lot. I have to stop to consider whether he was the best boss I've had, or just in the top 2.<p>I started Sonicity in '99 with two friends, which didn't work out for some of the same reasons here, but also for other reasons, like fairness concerns, no clear lines of communication, lots of overlap, and (of course) a cratering market. We might not have ended so badly had we not taken money, but whatever flimsy rapport we had before the startup didn't survive the strain of having a board and several new vectors of company politics (a CEO, a competing management faction, etc).<p>(I'm on good terms with both my cofounders there, and almost went to work with one of them at Bloomberg years later --- he's since started and sold a digital music player company).<p>Incidentally, the ""working with friends"" problem also occurs outside the founders team. We hired lots of our friends at Sonicity, and that was a problem too. If you aren't totally clear about your expectations (and we never were), friends expect a particular kind of management that is hard to maintain. Ironically, the best performer we hired at Sonicity is someone I almost got in a bar fight with the year before we started the company.<p>I started Matasano with Jeremy in 2005; Jeremy and I go back to 1995. One of the things I think we did right, right off the bat, was to bring on a third person (also a good friend) as <i>our boss</i>. Neither Jeremy nor I have little thought bubbles coming out of our head saying ""I'm the CEO"". I'm Karl Rove, Jeremy is Condoleeza Rice, and neither of us want to be the Commander in Chief.<p>We've had conflicts, but the simple tactic of surrendering final say in the company has defused them; I'd be fired before drama I started wrecked the company, which is actually a really comforting thought.",1236786171

You will get random corruption of random files on your file system.<p>SDelete works by using the NT defragmentation API to discover what disk sectors are allocated to a file, so it can write to them directly. However, for whatever reason, in practice this does not work with encrypted (EFS) files. I've looked at the source for sdelete, and I can't see how it's going wrong, but I do know from experience (twice) that it does. The symptoms include blue-screens from corrupted OS files, overwritten documents, etc.<p>There is further corroboration here:<p><a href=""http://forum.sysinternals.com/forum_posts.asp?TID=3878"" rel=""nofollow"">http://forum.sysinternals.com/forum_posts.asp?TID=3878</a><p><a href=""http://www.tech-archive.net/Archive/Win2000/microsoft.public.win2000.general/2004-10/2258.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tech-archive.net/Archive/Win2000/microsoft.public...</a>",1236784102

In theory all work in voluntary, assuming you can leave job and still afford to pay for basic amenities like food, housing, transportation, and still provide for your family, etc until new employment is secured. If you cannot do these things, it ceases to be voluntary.<p>""but paying homeless people $3 an hour is barbaric, what do you want, homeless sweat shops?""<p>Well according to this logic, $2.50/hr is better than $0/hr; $2/hr is better than $0/hr; $1/hr is better than $0/hr, and so on. Everything you describe is a race to the bottom in terms of wages. There would have to be a very strong deflationary pressure to bring prices to the point where the above is capable of really purchasing anything. In such a case, the economy would be in shambles anyway, so employment in general would be a huge issue.<p>What you describe is not new and, at its core, totally exploitative. Living in a company town is strikingly similar to this. The employer actually ""pays"" the worker, $7/hr, but keeps  the $4 majority the payment of ground rent, food, etc. Of course, you leave any time--that is until your meager savings are depleted by a raised cost of living--one manufactured by the benevolent boss/mayor!",1236783862

It is highly likely that what you are experiencing is a result of atrocious mastering, and <i>not</i> a digital-vs-analog result. Note that it has to be a CD that physically dates from the mid-nineties, not merely an album from the mid-nineties, as companies have been going back and destroying the old music on re-releases.<p>Of course that doesn't address the issue of your personal memories and if you like that, hey, great.

Supply side economics means tax cuts for the well to do, who will supposedly then create the jobs that will grow the economy. But this rests on the middle class stagnating - something that has in fact happened in the last 30 years. The top 1% control 22% of wealth (as of 2006), compared to 8% in 1980. For comparison's sake, the last time this percentage was this high was 1928. If you don't think there's a high correlation between income inequality and levels of debt, then you are fooling yourself.<p>There's a point at which the middle class being too poor puts the entire economy at risk. We are there now. Being an acolyte of supply side economics today is like being a communist in 1989 - you can keep believing in the true faith, but it's been refuted in the real world.",1236783601

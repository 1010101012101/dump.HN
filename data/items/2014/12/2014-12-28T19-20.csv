Look, in my country,being a teacher used to be like being a lawyer or a doctor.<p>It used to be a prestigious profession.<p>Then some politicians,influencial thinkers came in and said,&quot;we need to focus on children,they have special needs,they are always right and if they cant learn properly it&#x27;s the adults fault&quot;. 30 years forward and the education here is totally broken,teachers are despised both by students and parents who want instant gratification no matter how dumb their offspring is.<p>But hey,they cant be wrong,they&#x27;ve been told all their life they are &quot;special&quot; and always right ...<p>>   Regardless of whether the parent&#x27;s are rich or poor, the children of these parents often struggle, and achieve below expected results in national examinations.<p>The big difference is rich people can literally buy a career for their offspring even if they perform poorly at school.

8807242,comment,8806819,8806819,0,0,bko,,,"> Finland is not a fan of standardization in education. However, teacher education in Finland is carefully standardized.  All teachers must earn a master’s degree at one of the country’s research universities.<p>I don&#x27;t think the author makes a convincing point as to why standardization is bad for students but somehow beneficial to teachers.<p>> There is another “teacher quality” checkpoint at graduation from School of Education in Finland. Students are not allowed to earn degrees to teach unless they demonstrate that they possess knowledge, skills and morals necessary to be a successful teacher.<p>So prospective teachers would be tested on teacher quality prior to graduation in an academic sense but not while they&#x27;re actually teaching? Not sure if you can test on paper or by demonstration whether someone is an effective teacher. It is certainly more easily visible in the field.<p>It&#x27;s a shame many in America don&#x27;t respect teachers. Perhaps the resentment is due to the fact that most in America don&#x27;t have a choice as to the primary school they attend. Like most Americans, I&#x27;ve had terrible teachers in the past and did feel some resentment. It was less infuriating in college since at least I had some choice as to the classes and school I attended. Coincidentally, I notice professors get a lot more respect.",1419796627

8807239,comment,8806143,8806915,0,0,diab0lic,,,"Costless copies. I hear this one a lot, one of my last room mates used to say this one a lot. Its so black and white isn&#x27;t it? How stupid am I that I don&#x27;t understand this? Copies cost nothing, of course they don&#x27;t. It doesn&#x27;t cost YOU anything to copy it.<p>Lets invert our perspective on that same concept. One copy of the movie (or TV show, or song) is purchased, lets say somehow its a blu-ray that costs $99.99. An inflated price to be certain, but it helps us illustrate our point as nearly all blu-rays cost less than this. Using the &quot;costless copies&quot; model you&#x27;re suggesting that there is zero economic damage from this first purchaser posting copies online and all other content consumers instead drawing from these &quot;costless copies&quot;. This is false. You may argue there is some middle ground but then this is a logarithmically decreasing cost or something of the like, not costless.<p>People&#x27;s concept of what defines zero or nothing (in the case of cost here) continually astounds me. Anyone who argues this &quot;costless copies&quot; model is at best selfish and ignorant, at worst a thief. You may counter this argument and say that its not something you would have paid for -- well you wanted it on some level or you wouldn&#x27;t have pirated it. These people continually want to have their cake and eat it too.<p>There is little difference, morally, between this and me coming to your house, kidnapping you and forcing you to work for me, maybe you&#x27;re an accountant or a laborer or something I could use, but probably wouldn&#x27;t just pay for. (If you&#x27;re still a fan of extreme, over-simplified analogies like &quot;costless copies&quot; we can call this slavery -- something we&#x27;ve nearly universally agreed is wrong.) The difference of course being that you can disconnect yourself from it by doing it online. If you&#x27;re about to make the counter argument that unlike the movie you downloaded and watched, I actually need an accountant, or labor, don&#x27;t. You wanted the movie enough to pirate it, and spend two hours watching it.<p>Do yourself a favor and stop making yourself look like so foolish by citing this costless copies bull. Its infuriating to see otherwise very intelligent people make such a blind and over-simplified claim. You might have a hard time accepting this but both sides of the argument are &quot;manipulating morality&quot;.",1419796607
8807238,comment,8806963,8806963,0,0,jandrewrogers,,,"These containers are problematically slow for most use cases but it is not really their fault. An internal design that will give good performance is <i>hugely</i> dependent on the use case and the C++ STL offers little ability to specify the nature of the use case so that appropriate internals can be constructed. Consequently, the default implementation will always be pathologically poor for some significant subset of use cases.<p>A similar problem exists for other types of STL containers but it is particularly acute for the map and set containers. Some programmers end up building their own library of map implementations, each implementation optimized for a different use case, to get around this problem. The number of template parameters you would need to generalize std::map would be ridiculous, so it is easier to just have a lot of specialized implementations.<p>For high-performance code, std::map and friends are usually the wrong choice. Personally, I always write usage optimized maps as needed these days; the first couple times seem tedious but it quickly turns into a simple idiom you can implement in your sleep.",1419796604

In other words: if you ensure your favorite theory of quantum gravity in the appropriate limits reduces to the standard model and Einstein&#x27;s theory of gravity, your theory has survived all falsification attempts ever undertaken in the history of physics.

More specifically, I suspect it&#x27;s consistent to suppose -- hence there are no humanly-comprehensible counterexamples -- that the <i>only</i> notions of goodness obeying all Goedel&#x27;s axioms are ones that look like &quot;P is good iff P(x)&quot; for some fixed object x. (And, like Krishnaswami, I think the system of modal logic Goedel needs is awfully strong.)<p>In the spirit of Anselm&#x27;s ontological argument, however, I offer the following proof of the <i>nonexistence</i> of God:<p>Consider a really bad argument for the existence of God. In fact, consider one so bad that no worse argument can be conceived.<p>Obviously a bad argument for something fails to prove what it purports to prove. But merely failing is a pretty mediocre kind of badness. The worst possible argument, surely, has to be much worse than that: it must <i>conclusively prove the opposite</i> of what it&#x27;s meant to prove.<p>Now, the worst conceivable argument for theism clearly &quot;exists in the understanding&quot;, as St Anselm put it. But it can&#x27;t exist only there -- because a bad argument is more damaging to the premise it&#x27;s meant to support if it&#x27;s <i>actually made</i>.<p>Therefore, there is an argument for the existence of God which is actually a conclusive proof of the nonexistence of God.<p>And, of course, any proposition that can be conclusively disproved is false; therefore there is no God.<p>(This argument is in my opinion almost exactly as strong as the original ontological argument for the existence of God. Which is to say, it&#x27;s absolutely hopeless. But I think it&#x27;s fun.)",1419795988

If teaching is an occupation that is culturally considered in high esteem, then it probably follows that schools are considered an important aspect of a child&#x27;s life. Children are therefore encouraged to do well in schools.<p>In PNG, students had to pay to go to school. Often a single child was supported through their education by their extended family. Some villages could only afford to send a few students to school. Those students worked exceptionally hard, knowing that it was incumbent upon them to achieve, and eventually payback their family from the proceeds of their future careers.<p>When working in rural schools in the UK I have encountered many students whose parents, and therefore their children, place little value on education. Often the attitude comes down to the single phrase &quot;I&#x27;ve managed and I did badly at school&quot;. Regardless of whether the parent&#x27;s are rich or poor, the children of these parents often struggle, and achieve below expected results in national examinations.<p>If we want to raise standards in our schools (both in the UK and in the USA) I think the key is in changing cultural attitudes towards education.

Same for the battery indicators, manually loading your desktop background, setxkbmap etcetera in your .xinitrc. You&#x27;re basically forced to mix-and-match your whole desktop.<p>GNOME 3 comes with batteries included. Everything works out-of-the-box. Yes, the eye candy is a bit too much, but I think the Activities menu is very useful and productive. I can just use my computer, like I did on Mac OS X before. But now I the Linux desktop also gives me much better performance, package management and stability.<p>Only thing I miss on GNOME 3 is a XMonad&#x27;s tiling system and keybindings. It&#x27;s a shame they lost the ability to swap the window manager for your own.",1419795344

But even in poor districts like the one my spouse teaches in, which have accumulated a whole layer of apathetic teachers, the impact of both poor and excellent teachers is way overestimated, and the impact of poor and excellent administrations (both the school principal and the district leadership) is tremendously underestimated.  A good principal, particularly one with strong school board backing, can almost single-handedly turn an entire school around (I&#x27;ve seen this happen twice now).  An excellent teacher with a poor principal and negligent school board can do very little other than provide a strong role model for the most promising students, and (with great effort) pull a handful more of failing students up to the barely passing level than their less talented peers.<p>Primarily, good principals act just like good engineer managers in corporations.  Just as good managers keep engineers isolated from the bullshit of upper management and adjacent managers, and give good engineers space to do their jobs, so do good principals let their good teachers do their job, and intervene when poor teachers fail to meet expectations.<p>Regarding the other factors mentioned, I do think poverty is a major hurdle, and the author of this piece rightly underlines its importance in poor school performance, but poverty is primarily an issue in that high-levels of poverty correlate strongly with lack of parental support and engagement (and not always due to a lack of care; often it&#x27;s because these are single-parent households where that one parent is working all the time).

My parents had time to show interest in my school activities, discuss what we were learning, and find out if I needed help. When I couldn&#x27;t understand centripetal force to my satisfaction for my 5th grade science fair project about the yoyo, they invited their NASA friend over for dinner so he could talk about it with me. 
I never wondered if my parents could afford to buy school items.

(I remember being at a friend&#x27;s house while his parents were fighting about this.)
I had a friend whose parents were very poor when her father lost his job, he was in a horrible mood for weeks and then turned to alcohol. Growing up in that kind of environment is incredibly stressful. 
I didn&#x27;t understand it so much as a little kid, just later. For me, getting a B was a horribly stressful event. My parents might be disappointed and I might be stupid. For my friend being home was a horribly stressful event. Grades never mattered at all to her.

Good jobs are scarce, crap jobs are plentiful, and the traditional middle and upper-middle classes will reasonably fear that they could be replaced at any point by fungible labor.<p>As we have seen across the world, such conditions create a political and social drive towards correction, though the nature of such corrections are themselves the result of parochial political prejudices (resulting in the Tea Party, the Occupy Movement, &quot;living wage&quot; efforts, anti-immigration legislation, the invasion of Crimea, the <i>Daily Express&#x27;</i> circulation numbers, and so on).<p>Historically, such stagnation has also been corrected by the accessibility of new employment markets (physical frontiers, industrial and postindustrial revolutions or, more recently and on a very small and temporary scale, new petrochemical extraction methods), or the destruction and concomitant rebuilding of industry (such as the post-WW2 efforts in Europe).

There were few jobs on the reservation and many of the kids&#x27; parents were unemployed, and even the ones that were rarely were in a position that required any education. That&#x27;s a huge demotivator for kids--why sacrifice for education when you can&#x27;t see in front of your face that education might yield any benefits? Then there was, of course, the social ills associated with poverty, which distracted kids from school: alcoholism, drug abuse, crime, domestic violence, and sexual abuse.<p>I&#x27;m personally enormously skeptical of the idea that education is a solution to poverty,[1] at a large scale. There is a game theory problem in play. The fact is that it&#x27;s unlikely that education will lift an individual inner city kid &quot;out of the hood.&quot; A relatively excellent outcome for diligence and hard work would be going into debt to attend a third rate college, for the privilege of fighting for a low-paying service job. So it&#x27;s totally rational for kids to be more preoccupied with whether joining the right gang will keep them from getting harassed on the way home from school.<p>But if everyone worked hard and got educated, what might happen is that economic opportunities could be created &quot;in the hood.&quot; That&#x27;s the prisoners dilemma--the individually rational decision to devalue diligence and education leads to a globally worse outcome. This is where culture comes in. You see this with poor immigrant communities. They have little capital, but have cultural mores that create an incentive for education and hard work. A kid might not leave the neighborhood through education, but he&#x27;ll get social standing in the community, among authority figures and peers. When everyone has that incentive, that creates economic opportunities within the neighborhood. After all, there are neighborhoods in Bangladesh far poorer on an objective scale than the worst ghettos of Chicago, that nonetheless have bustling local economies.<p>[1] Poverty is, of course, relative.

There are going to be no shortage of thin analogies and excuses in response to you in afraid. Regardless of the merits of copyright and how &quot;dumb&quot; the laws enforcing it are, I can&#x27;t see how you can argue with your point about the content creators being deprived of an income. Maybe those creators do get screwed but they&#x27;re still getting something and to say pirating is okay because maybe the system changes and those creators get a bigger piece of the pie or change their business model seems wrong to me. Who are we to decide what amount of collateral damage is acceptable? Like you said, this stuff is easily accessible legally.<p>Just about all of us can easily get what&#x27;s primarily being distributed on sites like Pirate Bay. Netflix, Hulu, iTunes, Cable Company X On-Demand streams, HBO Go, Spotify, etc. it&#x27;s all out there and far easier to access than hopefully getting a high quality rip off a torrent site. Okay, maybe some things aren&#x27;t available in all countries and maybe the business model makes it next to impossible to buy a copy of a movie or song once and have it on all your devices in some cases. But really, is that really the primary use case for the Pirate Bay? Someone is going to say it is for them but if you believe that that&#x27;s the primary use case across the board then you&#x27;ve got to be an apologist or just lying to yourself. Have I pirated movies, music, and software? Absolutely. Because I couldn&#x27;t afford or just didn&#x27;t want to pay for it. But I sure as hell am not telling myself that it was okay because copyright is evil and because &quot;business models&quot; and people who pirate wouldn&#x27;t pay anyway so no one loses money.

8807019,comment,8806819,8806819,0,0,stcredzero,,,"<i>...education policies in Finland concentrate more on school effectiveness than on teacher effectiveness. This indicates that what schools are expected to do is an effort of everyone in a school, working together, rather than teachers working  individually.</i><p>Or, as Hillary Clinton put it, &quot;It takes a village.&quot; I suspect that it&#x27;s a part of the plight of many immigrant parents who live in isolation from an ethnic/cultural community, to feel like asking, &quot;What&#x27;s wrong with you?&quot; of their kids, because they keep noticing that things their kids don&#x27;t know things that they &quot;should know.&quot; My parents expected me to know many things I would&#x27;ve picked up in my environment, had I grown up in the same one my parents did. This kind of knowledge is illustrated in Frank McCourt&#x27;s <i>Angela&#x27;s Ashes</i> when the city born lads see a cow for the first time, and onlooking adults wonder if they are mentally deficient. &quot;What are Cows!? Cows are cows!&quot;<p>Another example of this kind of knowledge: When my family engages in activities, like going somewhere, we generally imagine what all of the others are doing and optimize our activities to minimize crossing paths and causing each other wait times. This isn&#x27;t something we were ever explicitly asked to do. My sister and I just picked it up from our parents. In stark contrast, an ex-girlfriend of mine would instead only perform narrowly delegated tasks and discharge whatever task I delegated as quickly and directly as possible, without regard for how that would impact my activities, even if that would mean covering a cutting board I was using with another ingredient. Apparently, her father would punish initiative as a matter of the principle of obedience, and order around his family like robots.<p>Yet another example of this: in Japanese homes, people are expected to remove their shoes and arrange them in a neat and orderly array, optimized for exiting with a minimum of fuss and socks contact with the foyer floor.<p>Also very significant, in Finland: <i>&quot;teaching is regarded as an esteemed profession, on par with medicine, law or engineering.&quot;</i> In the US, teachers are regarded as occupying a class between the working and professionals, esteemed lower than professions like medicine, law, and engineering. It says much about our society&#x27;s priorities, that we say, &quot;Those who can&#x27;t do, teach.&quot;<p><i>becoming a great teacher normally takes five to ten years of systematic practice. And determining the reliably of ‘effectiveness’ of any teacher would require at least five years of reliable data. This would be practically impossible.</i><p>This is somewhat the inherent dilemma of hiring for any skilled profession. Mentoring is probably key here.",1419793436

Afaik you should be able to run some random 20 year old executable as long as you got the right libraries or have it statically compiled. Also considering that X11 (the protocol) is backwards compatible for quite some time, I&#x27;d say that cross-distro binaries in Linux is definitiely achievable thing if the application developer puts the effort into it. What is missing most is documentation and tooling to support such efforts.<p>In near-future I also see containers as a possible cross-distro packaging solution, but that also needs some tooling to make the process more pleasant.

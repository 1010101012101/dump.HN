Because what the evidence is showing is that some people have difficulties learning some topics or take longer to learn them, and in many cases have misconceptions that make it more difficult to teach the topic to them effectively.  And the evidence shows that traditionally taught courses (lecture/memorization based - taught by people not trained in more effective teaching methods like active learning) often do not significantly impact conceptual change of such students.<p>The Bornat & Dehnadi Goats & Sheep paper is interesting in showing that we can diagnose students who have significant misconceptions or lack of knowledge needed to learn programming (see similar research on concept inventories showing the same thing in a wealth of other subject areas).  Beyond that the strongest interpretation would be that students with misconceptions are less likely to succeed in traditionally taught CS courses.  Not that such students can NEVER learn the topic and NEVER be a programmer.  I wasn't surprised to see their research wasn't published (although it is so easy to get such research published - especially when the peer reviewers aren't trained in educational research and learning theory, either).  But a line like this would never stand up to peer review by people who are even remotely familiar with research in computer science education: ""change the language, change the application area, use an IDE and work on motivation. None of it works, and the double hump persists.""  There are decades of studies showing various strategies that DO help more students learn and better understand programming and computer science concepts.

4528920,comment,4528379,4528656,1,0,tluyben2,,,"I think the comments here on your reaction are interesting; most people with careers (especially on HN) are working 24/7 to be able to spend, for instance, time with their family <i>in the future</i> (which, if you are an entrepreneur, statistically, is not likely to happen soon). And yet the responses here are saying that if you think family is important, you would let other things drop. There definitely are people who value family over all, and I know quite a few of them (my sister being one), but she is not on HN on a sunday. Neither does she value the amassing of money as something important in life. Reading most of HN shows that most people here do, no matter what (outside of killing others (at least openly; killing in China in factories is fine until the press finds out); killing yourself is acceptable risk).<p>So i'm not sure how everyone is so '4 hour workweek' in their comments; you can be with your family and you don't need millions to do that. If you really want that, there is no reason you are not doing it right now. I think if you have passion for something and you are postponing that for 'something something pot of gold', you don't really consider it that valuable.<p>Something for instance you quite often read in forums and such; 'I want to be with my family most, but I live in a city so I have this and that $$$$ costs per month minimum which is preventing me, in this economic climate to be with my family.' That's of course crap; move. There are tons of places in the world you can live of $500-600 / month and be happy with your family. But no there are a million excuses why 'thats not possible'. So you don't <i>really</i> want to be with your family that much, then, you have other goals topping that which you are trying to hide/disguise for yourself because you sound like a dick admitting that?<p>You can exchange 'family' with any passion. I have a friend who's biggest dream in life is to be a musician. But he comes up with 1000s of reasons why it cannot happen <i>now</i>. For the last 15 years mind you...",1347793975

The ""goats vs sheep"" study cited in the link's ""highest-voted answer"" has appeared on the front page at least once before, recently.<p>I am more interested in the meta-question: what are the implications of this question? I.E. if we knew for certain that the answer is ""yes,"" how would this change our behavior (and likewise if the answer is ""no"").<p>I would think: if we knew for certain that some people can program and some people just can't, we would focus more energy on sorting people early on, to avoid wasting everyone's time trying to teach the unteachable. By contrast, if we knew for certain that everyone could program given the right circumstances, we would focus more energy on devising better teaching methods, etc.<p>Because of this, I am inclined to maintain a deliberate bias toward ""no"" (I.e. I am inclined to behave as if anyone could learn to program). Even if the answer really is yes, there are sure to be some cases where a ""programming-capable"" individual struggles at first for some reason, and an ""anyone can program"" general attitude is more likely to save them from mis-categorization as a non-programming ""goat.""",1347793617

If there was a functioning, liquid, accessible market for advertisable IP prefixes, you wouldn't have to convince anyone that a /8 was worth $1bn; it just would be.<p>you are missing a big point.  This isn't like real-estate.  This is plumbing.<p>Go do a search on ""routing table growth""<p>This is actually a much larger problem than IPv4 runout. I mean, it's a problem that is further out, but it is going to hit well within my expected lifetime, and it's going to be a dramatically more difficult problem to solve.<p>The thing is, every time you break up a larger block into a smaller block, every router on the internet needs an entry in their routing tables[1] Usually, in content-addressable memory;  Expensive stuff.<p>The thing is, the size of the global routing table?  it's growing faster than moore's law.[2]  I mean, it's not a huge deal now;  for the price of a new compact car, you can get a router that has enough content-addressable memory to handle full tables and two 10g uplinks with 48 1g downlinks.  reasonable cost of entry, if you ask me, and if you use dram (good luck with line rate 10G.  don't think about faster line-rate.) well, then the cost is trivial.   The routing table is under 500,000 entries in IPv4, so it's a trivial amount of dram.<p>The problem is that if this continues?  (and all indications are that it's going to /massively accelerate/ if IPv6 catches on.   At a minimum, you're gonna see the same number of ipv6 routes as ipv4 routes... and because IPv6 addresses are larger, ipv6 routes are larger)  those routers are going to get more and more expensive.<p>So yeah, really?  we need a way of charging, not for each IP, but for each announced route.    Of course, that comes down hard on the little guys, whereas a per-IP charge is much more progressive.  (a /8 takes up as many routing table entries as a /24.)<p>Getting by with a reduced number of IPs would be way easier for me than getting by without announcing my own block.  Without BGP announcing my own block, my ISP has my balls in a vice.  If they go down?  I go down.  More importantly, I need to change IPs when I switch to a new ISP.<p>I know what this is like, because I started out on my ISPs IP addresses, like almost everyone does.   My provider found out that it's hard for me to switch off those IPs, so now I'm paying them, in total, for all the services they provide me, about twice market rate.<p>(It's actually really interesting, watching the dynamics of this problem play out on PPML or the like.  Small players, like me, want to keep it easy to announce smaller blocks.  We are fucked if you can only announce large blocks.   Large players want tight restrictions on what size of a block you can announce, because they have the address space and they would rather not pay for more super-expensive CAM every time a Luke Crawford gets it in his head to start an ISP.)<p>[1] This is not strictly true.  ""every router that matters"" would be closer to the truth.  If you don't have full tables from multiple upstreams, well, you will be effected by rather more partial outages than if you do.<p>[2]<a href=""http://bgp.potaroo.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bgp.potaroo.net/</a><p>[3]<a href=""http://bgp.potaroo.net/index-bgp.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bgp.potaroo.net/index-bgp.html</a>",1347793435

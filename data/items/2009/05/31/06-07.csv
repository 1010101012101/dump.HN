634502,comment,634058,634409,0,0,gchpaco,,,"I have to admit, I really like Tcl's syntax.  Some issues, but it was something you could programmatically manipulate without huge pains.  And the C interface was quite pleasant, particularly if you had ever dealt with contemporary Perl modules.  I was looking into it many years ago as an extension language that was simultaneously not extraordinarily lame but not permitting you raw hardware access, either, and liked what I saw.<p>But the core design didn't age well, I don't think; dynamic variables, little consideration for modular programming, primitive data structuring tools, etc.  I like looking at Tcl-without-the-warts type languages, but it's really just masturbation.  Lua is almost as flexible and certainly better put together.",1243752731

Losing American jobs also increases the costs of our social welfare programs.<p>However, since our social welfare programs are presumably better than China's, creating a Chinese job at the cost of an American job likely leaves the world better off if we assume that the increased taxes and decreased American income would result in a negligible decrease in well-being in comparison.

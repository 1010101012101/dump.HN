Unless we migrate to some technology which involves signed, verifiable sources, there's nothing they can do about things like that.

Everything that happens between telcos on the wire is trusted since telcos trust each other.<p>There are valid use cases for that too of course - setting your presented id as the number of your company's reception, having a single number for incoming connections (or a group) but using multiple lines for calling out, etc.<p>You can probably ensure the account sending the traffic is closed since it's likely to break multiple local laws, but on the receiving side, there's nothing left to do.",1327492653

3509397,comment,3505853,3505853,1,0,johanjessen,,,"It's a very interesting topic. I've worked at a company where we would get a stack of applications (about 1500) over night (right before the deadline of course) and the crappy tracker system we used would crash. Even worse I searched for a reasonable alternative, but simply couldn't find one that was SIMPLE. Sure there're plenty of bloated CRMs out there, and even some honest efforts like jobvite and interview street. But I couldn't find the right balance of simple tracking and review/screening features. So, as PG once suggested, I went and built my own.<p>It's still in dev mode but we've gotten pretty good responses from potential customers so far. Some of the issues we've tried to tackle has been the resume ""problem"" as discussed here. The thing is, resumes are much more than the content they hold. The design of the page, the choosing of words and descriptions, how to weight the important stuff etc. You can tell a lot about a person by looking at their 'paper' resume. It's almost like judging a person by their handwriting, though this metric is sort of skewed since everyone I know, myself included, has developed crummy handwriting ever since spending 10+ hours/day communicating via a keyboard.<p>An interesting point-of-view I've seen a lot of places is the obvious, yet under-prioritized factoring of values and soft skills. Personally, I think it's nave to think you can attract ""the best, the top 1%"" of coders, managers, product devs and so on. What would be far more valuable in terms of hiring would be to find those people that would actually fit the company culture and team the best. Skills can be learned, but personal values and interests can't. So a silly manager might ask for someone under 30 with 15 years of experience in C#, Java, Ruby, and some html/css for good measure. Yet, this is the skewed metric to evaluate on. Instead, they should find the person who finds the problem they're meant to solve interesting and someone who would fit well into the company and the team. If the candidate 'only' knows C++ and Python, it's far easier for them to get up-to-date on the company program running on Ruby than trying to force the 'ideal hard skill candidate' into a culture he/she's not comfortable in. Prioritizing candidates in terms of soft skills and values are actually one of the pillars of the program I'm working on. It's a tough nut to crack..<p>Another issue we've talked about is how to evaluate someone with a minimum of screening bias? There's so much bias going into an evaluation of a person, and it's a well-known issue that we tend to look for people similar to ourselves - even though it might not be what the company is actually looking for. So, if the application tracker could enable ""blind"" mode and switch off certain information like pictures, names, tests scores etc. it could potentially negate some of the bias involved in screening. Even letting multiple people rate a candidate could negate some of it, yet the work flow used in most HR departments simply don't allow for this kind of flexibility.<p>Long rant, interesting topic.",1327492295

How many portraits are done in the style of the Mona Lisa, or landscapes in the style of a well known impressionist, or photographs of Yosemite in the style of Ansel Adams? Hell, an arts education, purely by teaching form, style and composition based on prior works is essentially a study in how to violate copyright if this ruling stands.<p>To me the more important question with artwork has not been copying the style of a work, that <i>is</i> basically how most art in the world is created.

Nothing much creative or new here.<p>The photos are too small to make a good evaluation, but to me it seems that the second photo was not even taken on a overcast day (shadows on the building are more harsh).<p>These are just speculations and it may as well be that also the first photo was taken on a sunny day and the photgrapher simply lowered the contrast in post processing (the judgement describes only the manipilations ""In summary"").<p>Anyway, this doesn't change a single thing in my opinion. I would go as far as to say that white sky is not only a common technique, but it's also iconic in this case (i.e. it was notthat much of a creative idea to express something unique).<p>The judgement is <i>full</i> of notes taken about the several differences between the photos, among which composition itself is the most prominent, yet the sky becomes so important??<p>Really, I believe the whole thing is much simpler that all what is written in the judgement: a) the two parties involved already had problems in the past (see point 2) and b) the judge was biased by the fact that the second photo was done in a similar way <i>on purpose</i> (Point 10 ""He clearly knew about the claimant's work when the second image was produced because the whole point of the exercise was to produce a non-infringing image given the complaint about the first image the defendants had used"")",1327491116

But what does it mean in terms of people?<p>In those terms, ""the average"" is just a narrative of what the average person would be like. Which seems to be breaking down.<p>Sure - you can make a list of specific things that every person needs or desires, as there is a lot of commonality between people. Aside from that commonality, we do different things, which are specific to persons or groups. You cannot really speak of a mathematical average there, as those are qualitative differences not quantitative differences (and the groups also overlap...).<p>How do you ""escape the average""? How is it to be ""average""?  How will you and other people escaping, affect that average?

You start with some little molecules floating the ocean, you let the simulation run, and eventually you get a complex equilibrium that includes ants, giraffes, and those parasites that mind-control mice into getting eaten by cats.<p>You start with self-sufficient peasant farmers that don't want barbarians to take their stuff, you let the simulation run, you eventually get towns, feudalism, enough surplus food to feed a few scientists, the industrial revolution, world wars, the military-industrial complex, the internet, high frequency trading. There is not someone designing this progression. It is a system of particles that in each time step apply an update rule.<p>If we want to stop it, we need to figure out what force we can apply to the system to make it settle into a different equilibrium. That's not even the hard part, since the system is not very stable, and can collapse into new equilibria very quickly, just like natural ecosystems can when you introduce new species. What's hard is understanding the dynamics of the system well enough that you can steer it into a state that you want, and make it stay there. Otherwise it is like introducing kudzu for erosion control. Well, it sure controlled erosion!<p>I am not a fatalist or a nihilist.

It was a nice example of the current ""conventional thinking"" refuted by that other story yesterday about how England escaped the malthusian trap. Why is this story still here and the newer one gone already? Jared Diamond is very useful in this field, so maybe vote up some of his newer stuff?\n",1187448705

I'm going back to Reddit.<p>I don't think this site was meant for everybody to post whatever they want.  There should be respect for other people's resources; while Reddit and Digg want as many users as possible, there is no such leverage here.<p>I think the mistake is that users start thinking they can do whatever they want just because a social site is free.",1187448203

43790,comment,43686,43727,0,0,BrandonM,,,"This probably won't be a popular opinion, but from a truly objective standpoint, I think it's possible, for the same reason that non-blacks are a standard deviation worse at athletic endeavors. Two factors of evolution point me to this conclusion. Europe became civilized long before Africa, which I would guess leads to a natural selection for intelligence in Europe (as opposed to physical abilities in Africa - hence better athletic abilities for them) starting longer ago than in Africa.  The second factor is Africans' earliest days in America, when they were actually bred for physical ability while the intelligent dissenters often were killed or not encouraged to have children.<p>See, I told you it wouldn't be a popular opinion.  I don't think it's something that should just continue to be ignored, though. Turning a blind eye to possible facts just because we don't want to believe them doesn't make them go away.",1187447081

It's trying to over-optimize for memory to the point of choking the scrolling.<p>This, however, can be fixed fairly trivially.<p>Allow the user to scroll anywhere (even past loaded content).  If you can't eagerload elements to compensate for it, then lazyload after the user gets to that point.  This gives users the illusion that the scrolling is truly smooth and responsive.  The important thing is never allow scrolling to stop unless it's truly at a dead end and there is absolutely no more elements to load.<p>The above is how UITableView functions.

4395664,comment,4390885,4394662,1,0,Tyrannosaurs,,,"Elsewhere in this thread I've actually implied he has a harder time of this. Cases like this show that investigators seem to get more interested when they have a higher profile target, a known figure, they want their 15 minutes of fame. I really don't believe he has it easier than everyone else, I think he has a far harder time of it, but I don't think that excuses his actions.<p>But being handled as a normal person means that he doesn't get to dictate terms to the police about how and where he'll be questioned. If he were a witness then maybe but he's not, he's a suspect being questioned for the second time. People talk about him not having been charged but if you read the UK appeals court judgement they say that the claim he's not been charged is a semantic distinction based on specifics of the Swedish legal system and that it is clear that ""legal proceedings have begun against him"".<p>Under those circumstances I don't think it would be normal or reasonable to allow him to dictate the terms under which he's questioned.<p>My intent in using possibility as opposed to probability is simply not not prejudge his guilt or innocence because I don't think anyone at this point has the evidence to do that.<p>I do believe that there is a case to be answered (I believe that's close to certain given the number of legal appeals and judges in the UK that have examined the question and the various objections) but all the evidence hasn't been heard so I don't want to start assessing likely guilt. If you have a greater level of certainty one way or another for whatever reason I have no issue with that, but I say possible because I think that's the most appropriate description at this point from what I've read and heard.<p>The ultimate problem is that the whole thing is messy. It's messy because rape investigations always are, it's messy because of Wikileaks and what may or may not happen as a result of that, it's messy because both of those are highly charged situations, it's messy because Assange is a complex figure and it's messy because of his actions and the ill considered actions of at least four governments have only made things worse.<p>The rhetoric it's a function of the medium where we all just pick up on the bits we disagree with rather than writing long form balanced pieces on the whole thing. If that's what you're interested in then this isn't a bad approximation of my view: <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/aug/16/julian-assange-wikileaks-refugee-protection"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/aug/16/julian-a...</a> though there are issues with it (specifically the fact that it doesn't mention that the Swedes have handed over people to the US in the past in ways that were, to put it mildly, troubling).<p>The main reason I have banged on about the rape position is that it's something that a lot of people seem to be willing to discard almost completely, in some cases to the point of misogyny (to be clear that's not an accusation I'm levelling at you).<p>My rhetoric may be wound up but I could say the same about discussions of me as a potential rapist (just one example among several I could pick from your original post), a suggestion which even hypothetically is clearly charged enough to likely override any clarity it offers and I'd venture given it's personal nature is beyond anything I said. Dare I say that it's a touch Fox News?<p>Unpleasant as these things are, it's part of the medium. Hastily banged out messages, only picking up the bits you have specific issue with, little time to consider subtlety. At least we have an excuse, unlike Fox.",1345196668

4395611,comment,4395180,4395180,3,0,Variance,,,"This is an excellent graphic, but the author has a strong stance against HFT (such as the pages he links to about high frequency quoting) that readers should moderate with an understanding of what HFT does in an ideal economic context--the ""purpose"" of HFT.<p>At the level of HFT, the decisions being made are too fast and frequent to be based on the fundamentals of the stocks being traded. Instead, algorithms are used to make trades based on ""technical"" analysis rather than analysis of fundamentals--technical analysis predicts how stocks will move based only on past movement, not on underlying reasons.<p>In some cases, this movement is movement that happened only seconds, or milliseconds earlier. In a market with no HFT, say that there's a stock where a large sale is made by some investor, driving price quotes down a few cents; and then a second later, another investor buys a large share, pushing prices up again to where they were before. This behavior makes stock charts jagged and gives a certain volatility to prices.<p>Now, imagine that you could algorithmically predict when a price is likely to go down and then  up again in cases like that, and so you could make a profit by buying low knowing that the stock price will be back up again one second into the future. You buy stock to capitalize on this, and if you buy as much stock as you profitably can, you'll essentially drive the price back up to where it will be after the original ""correction"". You end up correcting the price <i>before</i> the other investor does; and if your response time to the first investor's sale is fast enough, the time when the stock is underpriced will be reduced by you quickly buying.<p>This stabilizes prices, smoothing out the curves, and stable prices are valued in the market. People are willing to pay money for stability, even at those small levels; and that amount of money is what HFT is designed to capture. HFT also makes a benefit by being ""first"" on finding the right price through its algorithmic clairvoyance.<p>Sometimes, obviously, the use of these algos goes wrong. You get a flash crash with a death by ten billion cuts as the market moves to smooth in some incorrect way. But HFT is not all bad, and considering how much there is, it's impressive that it works as well as it usually does. The incidents you hear about are just like plane crashes; just because planes crash sometimes and it's big news doesn't mean that air travel isn't safer per mile than car travel. Similarly, HFT has a powerful smoothing ability that it capitalizes on (among other things that it does--but smoothing is one of its largest abilities), and most people who oppose it don't realize how essential price stability is to the market at those levels given how much non-HFT trading volume goes on these days.",1345194817

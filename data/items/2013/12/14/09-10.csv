6905245,comment,6903392,6905083,1,0,rl3,,,"I was referring more to atmospheric and thematic authenticity. Obviously, no one is going to believe health regeneration is real. In retrospect, I should have made it clear that I was speaking mostly in context of single-player campaigns.<p>My point was that, what may be dismissed as unremarkable by most people, might be compelling narrative to some teenage kid coming up on military age. Keep in mind that the games aren&#x27;t fiction in a vacuum, but fiction with real life military unit names, equipment, and in some cases setting. Then, marketing touts the fact that actual members of said real life military units helped make the game. That lends credibility to any perceived authenticity, no matter how misguided.<p>There is of course the argument that nobody that young should be playing the games in the first place, but it is what it is. On the other hand, if we&#x27;re talking about Medal of Honor, that might even be compelling to some young adults.<p>Either way, entertainment which utilizes ongoing conflicts has the potential to leave a bad taste in a lot of people&#x27;s mouths. It comes off as trashy if poorly executed.<p>---<p>Regarding ArmA, although it has vastly more realistic mechanics, it&#x27;s not really a valid comparison due to a lack of virtually any story or narrative at all.

With some base class and python getattr / setattr, you can factor out much of the code.<p>In general, the whole point of using microframework like flask is to keep a tight control of your code base.

Google writes it once, and scales it toward infinity.

This principle is what makes most software so profitable, per user there&#x27;s usually nothing to uniquely manufacture or create.

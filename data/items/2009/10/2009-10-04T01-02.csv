Personally I see Facebook just as something of a way to keep in touch with contacts - I really don't see it as anything more than that.  Not that I really care either way, I'd be more curious about the question of how many facebook friends the average user would consider to be friends let alone good friends offline.",1254621152

Its author argues that approaching the problem as engineering means accepting that complexity is how you get good performance; simplicity is for theoreticians. But this complexity leads to things like a data structure with 20,000 lines of code designed on the assumption that a cache-line is 64 bytes being used primarily on machines with 32-byte cache lines; a redesign optimized for 32-byte cache lines would come close to starting from scratch.</i><p>...<p><i>If your data is strictly sequential; you should use a regular array. If your data is often sequential, or approximately sequential (e.g. an arithmetic sequence stepping by 64), Judy might be the best data structure to use. If you need to keep space to a minimum--you have a huge number of associative arrays, or you're only storing very small values, Judy is probably a good idea. If you need an sorted iterator, go with Judy. Otherwise, a hash table may be just as effective, possibly faster, and much simpler.</i><p><i>Furthermore, there aren't many ways to improve Judy, but there's a lot of room to improve hash tables</i> ... read the article for the rest of this (very good) graf.<p>Oh, and if it helps his credibility any...<p><a href=""http://nothings.org/computer/knuth.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nothings.org/computer/knuth.jpg</a><p>:)",1254621124

859532,comment,858791,859132,0,0,makecheck,,,"Yes, I think so.<p>I recently had to explain to someone what ""_"" means in Perl (not to be confused with $_ or @_).  It was simple for me to answer, because I had the experience.  But someone seeing it for the first time wouldn't exactly be able to Google it, or look it up in a man page; who would think to look for it under ""perldoc -f stat""?  What's more, this particular short-cut, while useful, has a side effect: if someone maintaining the code inserts a stat on a different file in between the original stat and the ""_"", then the source of the ""_"" changes.  For a single character in a script, that's a heck of a lot of barriers for a new programmer.",1254620814

It might be fair in some circumstances, but most of the time it's an indication of an uninformed or koolaid-driven opinion.<p>Scale is all relative, the only thing that scales infinitely are problems where the parts are all independent.  Therefore you need to pick a solution that will scale appropriately to your needs.  For the vast majority of applications in existence, the properties of SQL databases scale just fine for their needs.  Where advanced SQL doesn't scale, you can often squeeze several orders of magnitude more scalability through a variety of optimization techniques including sharding and denormalization.  A ""NoSQL"" (for lack of a better term) database might have better ""scalability"" out of the box, but will also tend to require more work up front wrangling data sets and more bugs than well tested SQL databases provide for the same data management functionality. Some people think this is offset by the lack of a parity mismatch between OO code and relational data sets, but I think that is more a symptom of people who don't really grok the relational model and the power and assurances it provides.<p>Increasingly as we move to more and more cloud services there is definitely a need for new approaches to more scalable data stores.  However there's not going to be something that comes along and is both more scalable and equally as powerful as the relational model across the board.  It's going to require tradeoffs to solve different classes of application-dependent scalability profiles.  However the relational model is a solid and proven theoretical basis for describing the majority of data we have.  Sure you have some edge cases like graphs and trees, but most data is not better described by key-value stores.  That's just wishful thinking.",1254618722

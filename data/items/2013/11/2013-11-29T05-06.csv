But I ultimately realized that I prefer a simple text based solution, because I can use a text editor rather than learning a complicated new GUI.<p>I ended up writing a simple wrapper around JFugue in Scala (about 10 lines of code).

6818077,comment,6817524,6817524,4,0,lgeek,,,"I&#x27;ll bite the bullet: Funnily enough, I think this sort of design fails to account for Moore&#x27;s law (different Moore, you see).<p>The principle here is to drop many of the principles that make modern processors fast: pipelines, caches, large register files, rich instruction sets (e.g. different instructions for different data sizes, DSP-style instructions, SIMD, etc). You end up with a really simple core, easy to implement, cheap in terms of die area. This might work well for certain applications (maybe as a power efficient microcontroller), but you&#x27;re left with two major issues: 1) you have no other way to increase its performance apart from increasing the clock frequency - we know that pretty much stalled; and 2) you&#x27;ll  discover at some point that while hitting the cache is expensive in terms of energy, it&#x27;s still better than hitting the off-chip RAM, and since you always have to go to the RAM... Apart from that, DRAM bandwidth has sort of kept up with processor frequency, but latency hasn&#x27;t.<p>At this point, you might think that this design would work well in a manycore system. Well, the problem with that is that we haven&#x27;t quite figured out the algorithms and software for many-core systems. Pretty much anything apart from data-parallel problems scales worse than linearly on manycore.<p>That being said, there&#x27;s one feature that I quite like: having an exposed separate return stack could improve the performance of virtualisation (dynamic translation), JIT engines and so on. Modern architectures have an internal RS used for branch prediction, but it&#x27;s usually not architecturally exposed.<p>tl;dr: Moore&#x27;s law led to fast RISC/CISC, MISC can only scale horizontally (many-core), which limits its usefulness.",1385704634

6818068,comment,6817614,6817931,0,0,GabrielF00,,,"It&#x27;s important to note that the &quot;couple dozen very healthy guys in the middle of any given workday&quot; that you are seeing are almost certainly not receiving welfare in the form of cash payments - (cash payments are generally how welfare is defined in the US). Since the 1996 welfare reform act, people  who receive welfare benefits (Temporary Assistance for Needy Families) need to be either working or in a job training program or they will lose benefits after a maximum of two years.<p>Welfare reform addresses the problem that you describe, but the work requirements also create other social problems. For instance, single mothers who might previously have been able to stay home with young children now need to work long hours at low-wage jobs.<p>It&#x27;s also important to realize that there are other factors besides the welfare trap that keep otherwise healthy men unemployed. As you pointed out, one is a lack of education that may only qualify them for low-skilled jobs. Also consider that if you&#x27;ve been to prison it&#x27;s incredibly difficult to get a job at all.<p>Also remember that when you&#x27;re driving through these neighborhoods you&#x27;re not seeing the people who are working.<p>When discussing how the unemployed &quot;drag down entire sections of cities&quot;, you should consider the causative arrow. Are these neighborhoods in trouble because of unemployment and idleness or do the chronically unemployed happen to congregate in these neighborhoods? Consider the effects of decades of disinvestment in minority neighborhoods and of white flight. Banks spent decades refusing to provide mortgages and small business loans in minority neighborhoods (&quot;redlining&quot;). Desegregation busing and the movement of minorities into traditionally-white working and middle class neighborhoods often triggered wholesale abandonment of the inner cities by these white families. When middle class white families abandoned the public school systems after desegregation policies were implemented, many inner city school systems ended up as warehouses for the poorest, least prepared students, greatly degrading the systems&#x27; capabilities to provide an education. Similarly, when middle class white families moved out of inner city neighborhoods these neighborhoods decayed.<p>Systemic poverty and unemployment are complex problems with many causes and cannot be blamed entirely on some culture of idleness.",1385704412

In some cases, this is manual labor, but as our society makes that less and less necessary, we are able to spend more effort on creative and intellectual pursuits.  Now, the problem with Fuller&#x27;s concept is that &#x27;creative and intellectual&#x27; pursuits are intensely introspective and rather qualitative.<p>One could say, &#x27;well I am ENTITLED to money because I spent a lot of EFFORT reading and analyzing the entire opus of English literature from 1200-1400.&#x27;  But whom did that enrich?  Why should we reward such behavior if it is solipsistic?<p>On the other hand, if someone said, analyze the entire opus of English literature from 1200-1400 so that someday we can assist Shakespearean actors in their dramaturgy - and I&#x27;m willing to pay you X dollars for it...  Now that&#x27;s creating value for SOMEONE ELSE.  It&#x27;s not an entitlement, you have contributed to society in a way that is demonstrable, as proven by the exchange of resources for your effort.<p>Work is necessary insomuch as it takes effort for one to provide &#x27;other people&#x27; with goods and services that these &#x27;other people&#x27; value.  Now, what constitutes work will be dramatically different and undergo tectonic change - playing video games, for example, as an alpha tester, can be work (and hard work, too) - as can being a world-travelling dance teacher - or being a football player (these are professional jobs that would not have existed 200 years ago)- or who knows what in the future.<p>Unfortunately the idea of doing work has been corrupted by a narrow-minded view of capitalism (agents on both the right and the left are guilty of this) and wages, have been caught up with cost of living and thus a sense of entitlement.  Certainly, there are people who we should contribute to help out for no reason other than compassion (a quadruplegic multiple gunshot victim I delivered food to comes to mind) but we should think hard about what the mechanisms for doing this are, and who gets to decide how much.<p>But the idea of abolishing all work forever is a dangerous one.",1385703701

Facebook/Google+/etc would be clients that would make requests for someone&#x27;s data via the DNS.  So it would basically serve as a &quot;Bridge&quot; or &quot;Facade&quot; to use a design pattern.<p>Example if Suzy is on Facebook, and Lucy is on Google+, when Suzy rquests Lucy&#x27;s photos, Facebook sends an API request to the DNS &quot;request_photos(&#x27;Lucy&#x27;, &#x27;Suzy&#x27;)&quot;, the DNS sees Lucy is on Google+ and forwards the request there.<p>The purpose of the bridge/facade then is to make it not really matter where a person stores their data or what client they use to view others.  You just need some sort agreed upon API for determining where the data for each person is, an for sharing data between services.<p>For someone with more strict privacy concerns, the DNS for such a person could simply record that the person uses this social networking service, which doesn&#x27;t allow requests from outside.  Again the benefit here of the API would be that to add yourself to that service would be as simple as &quot;upload_photos(serverX, request_photos(&#x27;Suzy&#x27;, &#x27;Suzy&#x27;))&quot;, etc.<p>I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a million things wrong with the above, but just a random thought.",1385703602

Let me explain..<p>Around summer 2007 (when I started using YouTube myself) YouTube started its beta version of the &quot;partner program&quot; where they salaried somewhere a bunch of people for a year and monetized their videos.  In about Dec 2007 they let anyone apply for the program doing the rev share on videos we see today.  I myself became a partner around March 2008.  Anyway until about May 2011 the program ran like this, you applied, waited months normally for a reply, and hopefully got accepted, or if rejected tried again and waited.....  In May 2011 they started trailing out a program where accounts in good standing could monetize videos w/o ever applying for partner, launching the start of the &quot;monetization&quot; program.  In about March 2012 they basically killed off the apply for partner program and replaced it with this where basically everyone on YouTube was a partner.  It&#x27;s been since then that any video COULD be monetized, its just as time has gone on more and more people actually monetized them.<p>My dates may be slightly off as its thanksgiving evening and I&#x27;m doing this off the top of my head but thats basically how things have gone.  It&#x27;s really nothing new...<p>FYI I run a website that reports YouTube & Twitch statistics called Social Blade so youtube data is something I&#x27;ve been watching for quite a while now. Hope that helps :)",1385701399

Patches accepted - but we need a way to easily get users a good default list.<p>I&#x27;m also not sure I&#x27;m convinced that just that list will get all of github blocked. What evidence do you have to support that? Lantern itself on github seems more &#x27;dangerous&#x27; than just the list of sites. And none of our Chinese users seemed to think this is an issue.<p>I&#x27;ll ask the greatfire guys, as I&#x27;m in touch with them. They wrote a great article on the last time github was blocked: <a href=\"https://en.greatfire.org/blog/2013/jan/github-blocked-china-how-it-happened-how-get-around-it-and-where-it-will-take-us\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://en.greatfire.org/blog/2013/jan/github-blocked-china-...</a><p>Also will try to ask the autoproxy guys directly - I&#x27;m not sure if their reason for using the encoded format is the reason you say.",1385701390

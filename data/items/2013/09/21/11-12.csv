India could never afford to create massive new cities using state funds like that, so it&#x27;s city growth was organic by force, not by choice.<p>Also the reason these cities are ghosts isn&#x27;t because there aren&#x27;t enough people in China (it is after all the world&#x27;s most populous country), but because they were ill-planned in terms of economic/social benefits for residents.",1379761723

Hearing that makes me think that the first thing anyone should do if using this is to profile, as there&#x27;s a very real chance that malloc() will dominate CPU usage for the deserialisation in that case.<p>The problem is that malloc() needs to be generic.  It&#x27;s not about never calling malloc(), but about deciding when it is necessary for your use case vs. specialized solutions tailored to your use.<p>In many cases you may know that the allocated structure will always be de-allocated at the same time, for example, in which cases pools/arenas can outperform malloc() by a magnitude or more in the right circumstances, and can also use less memory.",1379761319

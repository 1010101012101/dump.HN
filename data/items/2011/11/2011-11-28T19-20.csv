Bush expresses his concern for the direction of scientific efforts towards destruction, rather than understanding, and explicates a desire for a sort of collective memory machine with his concept of the memex that would make knowledge more accessible, believing that it would help fix these problems. Through this machine, Bush hoped to transform an information explosion into a knowledge explosion.",1322510342

It should be there exists a k such that for all n kg(n) >= f(n). Pedantic I know, but on the other hand I wouldn't call these ""beautiful equations"" associated with O(N), I'd instead call them the definition of O(N).<p>There's also o(f(n)), g(n) is a member of o(f(n)) if the limit as n goes to infinity of g(n)/f(n) is zero. Finally, there is asymptotic equality: f(n) ~ g(n) if the limit as n goes to infinite of g(n)/f(n) = 1. O,o and ~ are all subtly different, but if you're just trying to prove upper bounds then O(f(n)) is the one that comes up most frequently, which is why it's probably the only sort of asymptotic analysis most CS grads know.",1322509580

Offering tiered service to content publishers does not mean that traffic from those publishers must be prioritized for all consumers. Specifically, tiered publisher access can subsidize a new level of ""subsidized"" internet service, with price Y that is lower than the ""neutral service"" price X. More households will be able to access the internet as a result. Those households that prefer to continue receiving all publisher content in a ""neutral"" way may continue to do so (at the same price X).<p>Creative consumer education (as implied by Ofcom) can assist in this. ISPs are incentivized to do this because they can reach more consumers this way, ultimately increasing their bottom line.

Of course, it doesn't get to the crux of the argument: <i>when</i> it's more appropriate to use Scala/Erlang/Haskell instead of ""less academic"" languages. Typical among the academic community is the belief that computational efficiency doesn't matter for machine learning tasks when you're implementing them.<p>Of course, in practice, implementing an algorithm that performs well in experiments will only be slightly polished before putting it into production. Even in spite of the relative low cost of EC2 hosting, developers trying to maximize their ROI might find that the equation balances in their favor by maximizing efficiency on each core and decreasing the amount of memory that can be used. I admittedly don't know a lot about scaling experimental code into enterprise-level code, but I do know that at some point, it must reduce to a cost-benefit equation, where the costs of EC2 hosting is compared against the costs of development/debugging time in languages like C++.

NYC is a pretty cut throat arena and it is a lot worse when you are competing with your own site.<p>SEOwise - maybe it is our fault, but we were doing fine until we had to compete with ourselves.  It is our policy to not pay for stupid directory links and to not post fake reviews.  This was never a problem until another listing showed up for our company with a bunch of fake reviews and low social links.<p>My question is if Google should be taking on Yelp and Facebook in this space when at times they are unable to display basic business information like a proper telephone number.<p>If this happened on Yelp I would call our account manager and I am sure it would be fixed right away.  This is not an endorsement for Yelp, at all, I am just it is nice to have someone at these companies that you can talk to.  This happened once to our CitySearch page where the phone number was changed and we called and got it fixed.<p>With Google you have various business locations with inaccurate phone numbers, an adwords phone number, various report a problem forms that seem useless, and a legal form, again, useless.<p>Everyday I check  Google to see all the abusive edits that have made to our listing the night before and every edit we try to make goes unnoticed.  Are there super maps/google users who can do no wrong and edit whatever they want and have it stick? I mean somehow they are moving our location around in maps, every time we try to move the marker back Google does not approve the edit.<p>* I am posting this in the hopes that Matt Cutts will read it, but any help will be great. <i>",1322509303

However, it's something that must be tried at least for the sake of forcing a reconsideration of the US's draconian immigration restrictions on highly skilled workers.<p>There are a few criticisms that have popped up in regards to this project:
1) It will lead to the exploitation of workers.  Nonsense.  This only make economic sense of those non-US citizens who are skilled enough that it's worthwhile to be in proximity to SV.  The ""low-skilled"" niche is already occupied by companies outsourcing to Bangalore et al. and entrepreneurs outsourcing to oDesk, eLance, etc.<p>2) Successful passage of the Startup Visa would undermine the business plan.

Take his dismissal of psychological approaches to advertising, for instance. Why? Why are sociology and psychology no longer relevant? Maybe they're irrelevant in the old-school, Don Draperesque sense of their use (i.e., people sitting around in a boardroom and telling narratives about What People Want, and so forth). But then again, no one's done advertising or marketing like that in 50-odd years.<p>Psychology is as relevant to digital advertising as it ever was in analog advertising, and it'll be <i>massively</i> more important in social advertising. Understanding how the human mind works, why it chooses what it chooses, and how people are influenced and, in turn, influence others -- these things are still the bedrock of advertising. Media types may rise and fall, but the human brain is still the human brain. Group behavior is still group behavior. Psychology and sociology will be increasingly important tools in the marketer's arsenal as we move into the media of the future.<p>It's not an either/or proposition between psychological theory and real-time data analysis.

It works, and not only that, in some cases it works brilliantly. Not to say that it works for every audience (like HNers), or every product for that matter.<p>His point about low CTR is accurate but not entirely relevant. The user who asked in the comments ""What is the CTR of the magazine ads?"" hit the nail on the head. It's not always about CTR, but also brand impressions, reach and frequency.<p>Case in point: I did a campaign for a new brand in another country, which included display advertising. CTR was low, and initial conversions were low too. But over time, many would search for the brand after the visit, returning to the page and they converted! In so many other campaigns I would combine display with social media, email marketing and other stuff and get great results. Yes, I said email marketing. That still works too, and with some audiences, it is literally reeling them in. (No, I'm not talking about spam).<p>In short, Andrew is writing with an either/or mentality with advertising, when one needs to be thinking of and'ing: of all the tools available, which ones are going to work best together? Take a layered approach. Display advertising may be a hammer, but not every problem is a screw.",1322506995

Imagine you are building a widget that forms part of the internal mechanism of a space probe. It will likely only be seen or touched by a few technical people, it probably doesn't need visual appeal, but you must still design it to be feasible to manufacture and convenient to handle during assembly.<p>You will have to make decisions above and beyond its basic function - does the form fit the assembly worker's perceived model of what it does? Can it be held in human hands safely and without risking damage? Would any damage or incorrect installation be visually evident?<p>There is a false dichotomy between engineering and design. Modern technology is closing the conceptual gap. Whilst we need a certain degree of specialization, I strongly believe there should be no such thing as a 'pure' engineer or designer.

But 5.5 hours is highly abnormal. I fly fast, I generally leave my house about an hour before my flight. I'm lucky enough to be a short 10 minute drive from my airport. Security usually takes me around 5-10 minutes at SJC, and 10-15 minutes at SFO. I can fit two weeks of clothing (fresh shirts for every day, two pairs of jeans, fresh underwear and socks for every day, a jacket and a blazer) as well as all my office supplies and toiletries into carryon baggage, so I never check bags. All in all it's usually 45 minutes from my front door til I step on the plane. It's not hard to make flying fast, it just takes dexterity with the security. The TSA themselves recommend showing up 90 minutes to 2 hours before your flight, but it's very doable to show up 30 minutes prior.

So far Emscripten has only been mentioned as 1-2 slides on each JS talk.

I can't speak to why that's the case -- maybe because they don't want to make anyone be the person who does nothing but crap work. I don't think anyone sets out planning to do a bunch of rewrites anyway. In my experience it just sneaks up on you ""Oh, well we should probably cover this and I need a post, guess I'll just do this real quick."" That's just my experience, but there's certainly no one at TC telling me to do rewrites. I guess there's also varying definitions of what constitutes a re-write -- I don't actually always depend on a press release or anyone's else's coverage for every news short news story.",1350248154

Though failing that most photo edit software will cater for that with after filtering.

4652587,comment,4652071,4652356,2,0,barkingcat,,,"This is the wrong approach. You don't train someone to produce such works.<p>These types of proses are more like a personal distillation of experiences. You can take a handful of olympic athletes, pair them up with a great editor and writer team, and come up with a great story about what happened at the london olympics. That would be a cover worthy story.<p>It's not about training writers who can churn out articles. It's about understanding that writing itself is an art, not something that can be trained, but something that needs to be invented.<p>Put it in terms that people on hacker news would probably understand - Writing a major New Yorker cover story is like finding the topic, writing, and then defending a PhD thesis. You have to come up with an original thought, support it with research and original experimentation, distill it down, test your hypothesis, and see if your thesis is still solid. After rounds and rounds of editing, repositioning, rewriting, and PIVOTING, you come out with a kernel of an article - the amount of words written would be approx 10 - 20 times the amount of text that would actually be published. The rest would be research material and stuff ""left on the editing table"".<p>You can't train that. Successful authors understand this - all of their advice to young writers would include something like - ""only you know what kind of story you want to write"" - ""keep practicing"" ""keep writing every day"".<p>There is no handbook to learn, no school to go to.<p>Journalism school gives you a template of what other people have done, but at the same time, I consider it a waste of time for writers. Just go out there experience the world, talk to as many people as you can, and write seriously every single day. You'll come out the other side with a comparable set of skills as someone who went to school for journalism.<p>---<p>So what is the right approach? For me, it would be encouragement - start young - get education right. Bring up childhood and adult literacy, give people the ability to think and reason. Increase funding to schools and give teachers a better deal.<p>You'll find more and more kids wanting to write, keep practicing it, and thus we get better writers when they grow up.<p>For the immediate situation, the same thing applies - give people who want to write the chance to tell their story. Increase funding commitments to schools and higher education.<p>Get people talking about writing as an actual practice instead of as an advertising technique (ie writing copy) or as a purely legalistic/procedural language (ie taxes, lawsuits, and manuals).<p>People will become more interested in writing and the skills required in literacy.<p>Who knows, the best story might be hiding there in the heart of that guy you pass by every day living on the streets.",1350247546

If you've ever attempted to skydive (or fly in a wind tunnel), you know that the slightest move of one's hand can cause instability, or a spin. It takes a lot of experience to gain enough control to be able to really fly your body (and in the dead air at the altitude of this jump, all previous bets are off). Adding any sort of wings, fins, or whatnot would cause more uncertainty than it would certainty. (This is why wingsuits are so dangerous to fly - the extra surface area means that the subtlest of moves are magnified significantly.)<p>The safest option is a drogue parachute - the small stabilization parachute you see when watching tandem skydiving videos.

I don't dispute that it is important, or that it is enjoyable to some.<p>But my memory of the <i>Iliad</i> from my freshman course on Western civ was that it was a cross between allusions which I didn't have the interest or patience to track down, and a long list of warriors, with eight lines about their family history each, who then promptly get killed by Achilles.<p>Since then I've tried to read similar (maybe?) works of literature, with the same result.

It's quite a bit longer than Ulysses, at about 1.5 million words, but I find it really fascinating. The flow of his words, to me, seems almost musical.<p>However, I'd like to also point out that you shouldn't read ISoLT or Ulysses or any other book for that matter, just for the sake of saying that you were able to read it. I think that you lose the depth, the meaning of the words when you read to ""show off"". You ""read"" the book, the words flowed into your brain, but did you really understand what the author said?<p>Unfortunately, I think modernist literature is often susceptible to ""half readers"", where people start the book, but never finish it. Modernist style can seem pretty alien to some people (Background, as jseliger pointed out, is also important to understanding the ""meaning"".) As  Wikipedia puts it:<p>>""For the first-time reader, modernist writing can seem frustrating to understand because of the use of a fragmented style and a lack of conciseness. Furthermore the plot, characters and themes of the text are not always presented in a linear way. The goal of modernist literature is also not particularly focused on catering to one particular audience in a formal way. In addition modernist literature often forcefully opposes, or gives an alternative opinion, on a social concept.""",1350246608

4652540,comment,4652309,4652309,5,0,rabbitonrails,,,"I read Ulysses 3 years ago.  After initial skepticism, I discovered that it is truly a great work of literature.  One example that impressed me was the chapter Wandering Rocks, where Joyce implements a virtual Dublin that operates like a massive, clockwork simulation tracked over one hour -- he follows many different events and points of view as the characters walk through the city, experiencing events in accurate time that ripple across their perspectives (e.g. a clock chiming heard by 10 different people at different times and intensities according to their distances from the clock, echoes from the walls of surrounding buildings, and the speed of sound -- all mapped to Joyce's deep knowledge of Dublin's geography).  Ulysses requires a lot of work and time to understand.  I would like to recommend the following to anyone who wants to read it:<p>1. Give yourself about 6 months.<p>2. Do not read the text at first go.  Instead, listen to the excellent audio recording.  <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Ulysses-Naxos-AudioBooks-Joyce-James/dp/9626343095"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Ulysses-Naxos-AudioBooks-Joyce-James/d...</a>  James Joyce was a lyricist and singer and incorporated many auditory elements into his wordplay.  Many voices interact in this work, forming a weave that can be baffling on the page but which acquires a certain harmony read aloud.  I would even suggest that much in the way rap musicians take utter (often ridiculous) liberty with the English language, creating works incomprehensible on page but that can be understood in the context of song, Joyce experimented with language-as-lyric.  Joyce was known for waking up his wife by laughing out loud as he was writing this work -- he found the wordplay ridiculous and hilarious -- so don't approach it with the severity of a religious text.<p>3. Do not worry if you get lost or zone out.  Just keep going and review or re-read later.  If you try to understand everything you will never finish and become discouraged.<p>4. While you are listening to Ulysses, read Vladimir Nabokov's Harvard lectures on Ulysses.  <a href=""http://books.google.com/books/about/Lectures_on_Literature.html?id=jP5-XRoUVBgC"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.com/books/about/Lectures_on_Literature.h...</a>  This is a wonderful chapter-by-chapter companion that will make sense of the chaos.<p>5.

And I don't see how it's not relevant: our federal government is huge and almost entirely unaccountable, and clearly is not functioning as it was intended. From Federalist 45:<p>The powers delegated by the proposed Constitution to the federal government are few and defined. Those which are to remain in the State governments are numerous and indefinite. The former will be exercised principally on external objects, as war, peace, negotiation, and foreign commerce; with which last the power of taxation will, for the most part, be connected. The powers reserved to the several States will extend to all the objects which, in the ordinary course of affairs, concern the lives, liberties, and properties of the people, and the internal order, improvement, and prosperity of the State.<p>The operations of the federal government will be most extensive and important in times of war and danger; those of the State governments, in times of peace and security. As the former periods will probably bear a small proportion to the latter, the State governments will here enjoy another advantage over the federal government. The more adequate, indeed, the federal powers may be rendered to the national defense, the less frequent will be those scenes of danger which might favor their ascendancy over the governments of the particular States.<p>> How would removing an unrelated insurance corporation promote healthier decision making amongst investment banks?<p>Not unrelated. Gramm-Leach-Bliley removed barriers allowing commercial banks to act as investment banks. That was my point: you can't remove these barriers without also removing the insurance.

I think the housing bubble was entirely avoidable had the government taken different action. I'm not saying that it was ENTIRELY the fault of regulation. I do think that: deregulation (including removing the FDIC and SEC), much less Fed fiddling in attempts to 'fix' the dot com bubble, and no bailouts or any implicit guarantees of bailouts, and you wouldn't have seen the housing bubble.",1350245100

That's a great way of putting it, by the way.<p>I find this is often the case with any great work that is remote from where one is, whether in time or culturally or aesthetically. One must be willing to put in an initial good faith investment to ""fund"" the effort of reading it, with the expectation of profit later. Usually it begins to pay off before too long. Sometimes it never does.<p>Here's an interesting question. Among books that one has truly appreciated (i.e. excluding total writeoffs), which took the longest time before you broke even?",1350244969

If spammers realize that the only way to get past a filter is to make their message statistically indistinguishable from something useful, they may decide that the best way to do that is to make it something useful.",1178913180
21415,comment,21316,21397,0,0,mojuba,,,"Bayesian filtering or any other heuristics comes at a price of occasionally loosing important messages, no matter how good those methods could be in reducing spam.<p>And to my understanding, the best method so far is the statistical (voting-based) method that many large email servers run.<p>And there is one philosophical problem that TLB doesn't mention: we ourselves haven't figured out yet what exactly is spam. Is there a good universal definition of unwanted mail that should be filtered unconditionally?",1178912775

He used Lisp at JPL for many years before political forces rendered its continued use there untenable.",1178910945

It's sort of fun to see which posts get points, which don't, and which get tased.<p>If a solution to problem is necessary, I would first suggest scrambling the order of the leader board and hiding the Karma.  At least, hide the Karma from the leader board listing itself.  That would preserve recognition for the top contributors but there'd be less competition for the #1 spot.<p>Oh, and I like being able to downmod a post that was stealth-edited after I made a response for the sole purpose of saving face at my expense.",1178910088

But the market makers on the other side of the trade have to short the stock in order for them to properly hedge. Since it's much harder to do, the spreads on options became pretty retarded after the short-selling ban. This reduced liquidity, put the VIX, VXO, VXN, to all time highs, and exacerbated the moves downward.<p>The past 30 days have essentially become one very long one.",1223571573
328008,comment,327849,327849,0,0,staunch,,,"The first time I charged for a web service the hard part was getting over the guilty feeling that I was charging for something that cost me almost nothing. That's definitely not the case of course. I had to develop it, support it, pay for hosting, etc. Still, it takes a bit of strength initially to begin charging money for little more than adding a few rows to your database.<p>From the inside it's really easy to undervalue what you're doing. It's a big mistake too, because if you're solving a hard problem for someone they really don't mind trading money for it.<p>I think 37 signals emphasis on creating products you can charge for is their very best advice. Paul Graham didn't go for eyeballs with Viaweb -- he charged something like $300/mo for an online store application.<p>Working on a product that makes money is entirely different from working on a free one. In a thousand little ways. As a business I definitely prefer charging users directly and probably won't ever try to create another free (to users) business again.",1223571551
328007,comment,327844,327844,0,0,il,,,"I have a lot of experience with affiliate marketing(as an affiliate), and I think you should strongly consider a CPA rather than CPS model. Very very few affiliate programs, even ones with recurring monthly income pay their affiliates recurring payouts. Most pay a fixed one-time payment for acquiring the customer. For a site like yours, the industry standard would be paying about $2 for every free signup, or, alternatively paying $50-$100 per paid/free trial signup. The exact numbers will of course vary with your conversion rate and what's profitable for both you and the affiliate. That way, you don't get a recurring drain on your revenue, and affiliates see more money right away. Keep in mind that most affiliates market via paid search or contextual advertising, which means heavy initial cash outlays. As an affiliate, I want to see profit within a few days of running a campaign, and if I don't I drop promoting that offer.",1223571413

It's similar to the systemic inefficiencies in the Soviet system allowed an industrial buffer during their collapse (ref. Dmitri Orlov's essays).  This inefficiency will let people convert that half acre of useless lawn into a garden bearing a good percentage of the food a family needs, the same way durable goods piled up in warehouses because of the Soviets' command-directed economy could be used and traded by those with access.  Turn the local park into less-intensively-improved land growing staple cereals, and you've gone most of the way converting a suburb to a village that can at least subsist at a 17th century level.",1223571208

If the lock cannot be obtained (since someone else has it locked already), fcntl() will wait (block) until the lock has cleared, then will set it itself. This is a very useful command. I use it all the time.<p>F_SETLK 	This function is almost identical to F_SETLKW. The only difference is that this one will not wait if it cannot obtain a lock. It will return immediately with -1. This function can be used to clear a lock by setting the l_type field in the struct flock to F_UNLCK.<p>F_GETLK 	If you want to only check to see if there is a lock, but don't want to set one, you can use this command. It looks through all the file locks until it finds one that conflicts with the lock you specified in the struct flock. It then copies the conflicting lock's information into the struct and returns it to you. If it can't find a conflicting lock, fcntl() returns the struct as you passed it, except it sets the l_type field to F_UNLCK.",1223571060

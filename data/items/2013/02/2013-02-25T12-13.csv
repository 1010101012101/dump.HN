I read it as he's glad after all that facebook didn't hire him, so it's more like a message for those who already ""lost"" or will ""lose"" in puzzle-based hiring process. A message that states it's not necessarily their (i.e. prospective employees) loss in the end, and the more important part that it's not a reason they should feel bad about themselves after such ""loss"", because solving riddles is about solving riddles and not about finding good programmers (being one doesn't necessarily exclude having puzzle-solving ability, but it's not like a symmetric difference of these sets is empty, really, more like quite voluminous, I would say).",1361797149

All I really care about is turning the damn thing on, watching what I want, when I want, and being able to afford to rent the stuff I want to watch.  Now take that disinterest in the licensing and `openness' of a TV's software, multiply it several times, and you get close to the amount most non-technical people care about the software their TV runs.<p>I've worked with non-technical people long enough to know that they care about getting done what they want to do, easily, more than almost anything else when it comes to software.  That attitude may be short-sighted, but it's very much the standard;  all they want from a TV is the ability to watch $PROGRAMME with as little pain and inconvenience as possible.

mem2 -> reg2
reg1 -> mem2
reg2 -> mem1<p>While a swap trick, if the compiler can't backward-enginner it out has to add a bit of xoring (or adding).<p>gcc actually has an optimisation pass with the specific job of trying to take out this trick.

I do this unconsciously usually because I didn't fully understand the sentence the first time.  Better reading comprehension reduces this.

""Cyberwarfare"" is primarily data theft/information control but can also involve real danger like control of electrical grids, water supplies, and centrifuges for highly radioactive materials, to mention a few. Sure, information warfare has been going on a long time, and, sure, each major country does it.<p>But, when the world economy is teetering/has teetered and it's not clear how things will pan out, that is when wars start.<p>Now add to that that introduction of new disruptive technology is soon after used in war, and you have a problem that can't be whitewashed with a post like this.<p>Think about aviation. When I hear aviation, I think of the Wright Brothers- but what's next? Commercial flight? No, I think of bi-planes, the Red Baron, the use of aviation in the military, and war. The time period between the flight by the Wright Brothers in December 17, 1903 to the start of World War I on July 28, 1914 was 11 years. 11 years! Aviation didn't spawn world war, but you have to know that it contributed its part.<p>Think about the race for the bomb. And, what did we do when we finally had the technology? We dropped two of them.<p>It's sad to say, but the use of internet technology by the military is inevitable. The U.S. isn't trying to start a fight by identifying that China has state-sponsored attacks on American businesses. The fact is that even though we still somewhat live in a Cold war era (it never really ended) and to large extent, <i>no one</i> wants to see another bomb go off, the fact is, this shit is real. There is a power struggle on Earth and we've been a part of it since we were born. The internet binds us all together and helps us communicate our thoughts, fears, etc. and I want no part of a world war. But this ""new war"" has been in-progress for some time now and people have learned its ways and are using them. These little events like publically identifying centrifuges going down or that China is truly state-sponsoring attacks might not be Normandy or Gettysberg, but saying these are non-events is no better than hiding your head under the covers.",1361794484

While you could just do essentially what he does for the ASCII and have one symbol that represents all these, he doesn't seem to want to go this route. Which is insane, but hey, insane seems to be the normal for DF development.<p>The second part is that his last game died partly from his trying to implement graphics too early. Notice how the full title is ""Dwarf Fortress: Slaves to Armok""? Armok was the game before this. Similar in overly ambitious scope, but with an early 3d style graphics. However, for some reason or another, it became to difficult to support its development after graphics, and it collapsed under its own weight. Hence the switch to ASCII: he could continue implementing hundreds of features without as much regard for performance or implementation. It's easy to add in dozens of new creatures, random titans, genetics and randomized traits when you don't have to actually worry about representing it. I highly suggest reading his devblog (<a href=""http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/index.html</a>) just as inspiration for what one crazy ambitious man can do.<p>As for why he doesn't enlist more help, make it open source, etc, the answer is even simpler: this game is his bread and butter and both he and his brother live off the donations. Yes, part of it is that he wants to maintain control of the project, but if a program was literally the sole means of supporting you and your sibling, I think you'd be wary of giving away its code too. He has said it will likely be open sourced when he dies however.",1361793882

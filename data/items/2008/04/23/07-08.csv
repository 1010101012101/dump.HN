It'd be really cool though if it can be replicated with cheap off the shelf tech.<p>Do you know how hackable cellphone transmitters and receivers tends to be?  I really see the cellphone as the portal into a virtual/physical life hybrid.  If there was a cheap, popular cellphone with hackable hardware, then this could be a reality right now.  If it was also the hub for a personal network, then you could plug all sorts of interesting gadgets into the mix.",1208936126

Then, online players could be projected onto a physical player's HUD, and visa versa.  The arena itself could have RFID tags on corners to easily provide the geometry for clipping, so the virtual players aren't just superimposed on the HUD.<p>Now, if the technology that generates 3D details from pictures progresses alot more, then the system wouldn't even have to resort to hacks like RFID tagging.",1208935578

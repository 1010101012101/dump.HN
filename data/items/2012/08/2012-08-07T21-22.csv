It won't get made.<p>IP isn't what makes people pay to see Batman.  The loss of IP would not prevent studios from making a killing with Batman at a theater, they'd just have to be a touch more creative in controlling distribution, timing, and release of the official copy.  Even without IP, they can contract with the theater to make it a violation of the contract for the theater to copy the film as a condition of getting it.  IP isn't what protects the movie industry, it's what protects the home video industry and some of the long tail profits.<p>Also, making a great movie doesn't require 300 million dollars, and the world did just fine before 300 million dollars movies existed.",1344376749

Of course knowledge is a light burden and all that, but do really programmers <i>need</i> to know that much outside their area of expertise? Isn't a shallow understanding enough? Otherwise, what would you need dedicated business people for?<p>> Ya know, it would almost be fair for the business people to ask ""when will software developers understand software development?""<p>Good point! But then again, software development is difficult. It is hard if not impossible to estimate the schedule and cost of creating something that nobody has ever done before. And perhaps that is what the business folks need to understand. The tricky thing as a developer is explaining this without sounding like you're coming up with excuses for being late.",1344376669

Seriously, if I set out to design a bad UI, I would not be able to surpass them in awfulness.<p>I hear some of you are frustrated by the search and discovery functions. My company is in this space and we debate the best way to solve the 3 main use case scenarios:
1. I want to watch another 5 episodes of ""Breaking Bad""
2. I want to watch a comedy movie, maybe something with Tom Hanks
3. I have no idea what I want to watch<p>There's a lot of grey between those three areas and that's why Netflix quirky genre categories are so popular.<p>In terms of search, there are a lot of 3rd party apps, both web-based and otherwise. I personally like Clicker, which is web-based and can also show you which of the services (Netfkix, Hulu, Amazon) you have can serve up the movie you want to watch.<p>""Rights issues"" is a TV/Movie industry term that refers to the battle over which of the various distribution companies has the right to broadcast TV and movie content, on what  platform (e.g. If Comcast is paying NBC for the right to broadcast their shows on TV, do they have to pay more to also be able stream them to your iPad or is that covered by the original agreement) Because so much of this is new and because the industry is very profit-oriented, the lawyers are having a field day.<p>Final point, which I noticed a few people picked up on, is that the Netflix all-you-can-eat menu lets you experiment without consequences: you don't like a movie, it's not like you've just wasted any money paying for it.<p>And for the XBox remote dropper - if it's really become a problem, maybe you want to find another place to keep it?

Drag and drop reformatting of article layouts? Really? Don't the best Wikipedia articles tend to be conformant to template layouts?<p>Wikipedia is not Digg.

That said, it may be just a matter of time until technology gets to the point where it is possible.<p>There are positive uses for having access to DNA code for a Select Agent, e.g. creating a bio-sensor that will warn us against contamination, or creating an antidote to the offending agent, so it may not be in our interest to completely ban this DNA code.<p>The good news is that in SynBio we've not created anything from scratch - all that we know comes cribbed from Mother Nature's recipes. Knowing this, each biologic has it's own DNA signature that can be used to screen out any potentially dangerous projects before they are synthesized.<p>This is just scratching the surface of this question.

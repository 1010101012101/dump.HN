This provides an incentive to postpone merges which of course makes them even harder once the excuses run out and they have to be done.  Distributed SCMs recognize that branching is necessary, but actually provide the tools to make merging easy.  Once merging is easy, branching doesn't look bad any more.",1265813998

I didn't download, buy, or watch television content online either.  My first return back to TV was so I could watch coverage of the DNC and RNC during the election.  Late that fall / early winter, I started meeting friends in sports bars to watch KU football and basketball games.<p>After I stopped watching television, I found that I no longer want to be invested in series programming.  Shows that I had watched for years, I stopped watching and I have not picked back up (House was one of my favorites).  There are several series that I keep getting told that I should watch (Lost, Heroes, ...) but I just seem them as big chunks of wasted time now.  In 2009 I returned to watching TV but I find that I turn on channels like Adult Swim at night and it's more background noise while I'm online.",1265813991

The thing that make svn a ""toy"" scm is the branching model/facilities(e.g. merge) and this is the area that seriously needs to be improved. Do you want to bring svn ""to the enterprise""?

Our six year old is currently taking piano lessons, but he can make the decision to stop them if he wants.  He's also free to choose another instrument.  We didn't prod him into taking lessons, but it was our suggestion.<p>As far as physical activities go, we are letting him choose his path.  We're avid climbers, and take our kids with us to the crag, but never force them to climb.  Some days they insist on climbing, other days they're happy exploring the woods.  Both kids love riding their bikes (which also fits with our lifestyle), and our older son has taken a liking to soccer (though again, we suggested he try it).<p>I think it's also important that parents provide the opportunity for their kids to have autonomy.

1114893,comment,1114756,1114864,0,0,lionhearted,,,"> What exactly makes watching a thoughtful, well-crafted drama (for instance, The Wire) on television any less worthy than reading a good back or going to watch a play?<p>Great question. A few points:<p>1. A play or movie has a start and end time that is reasonably compressed - you watch Memento or Gattaca, it takes you two hours, you sit and think about it afterwards for a while, and it's done. A high quality program will run for many seasons, taking 30 minutes to an hour of your life times X weeks for however long. Also, being not as compressed, the average quality tends to be lower (with some exceptions of <i>very</i> good programming, though it's rare).<p>2. <i>Very</i> easy to just keep watching after the high quality program ends, watching the next thing that comes on. Very, very easy to do that. My housemate last year had a TV hooked to a DVD player and Nintendo Wii for parties, but no channels. I did buy him a box set of Planet Earth for his birthday after seeing some of it at a friend's house. But it's like, put on the DVD, watch it, put it away, done. No getting sucked in.<p>3. Garbage books are no good either - I tend to read books that give me a perspective on another culture (Koda Rohan, Eiji Yoshikawa, or Genji for Japan, for instance), or read business books, technical books, history, economics, finance, etc. I'd classify a lot of fiction as similarly mindlessly-distracting-without-growth too. That's fine for what it is, but I'd rather get the enjoyment while also developing as a person, asking myself tough questions, getting more in touch with another culture, gaining expertise, and so on.<p>But sure, there's some good TV. I used to go do cardio at the gym whenever a sports match was on that I wanted to watch, for instance, because they had a bunch of TVs, and I'd go during the fifth inning or halftime and watch the end of the game. I might buy a boxed set of DVDs and have a weekend marathon at my place sometime if a show is really good, insightful, and develops the character.<p>Still, I don't watch television regularly because I think I'll have a healthier, happier, more productive life where I reach more of my goals if it's not part of my life. Perhaps some people have knee jerk anti-TV reactions as a signaling mechanism that they're ""unplugged"", but that's not it in my case. Some TV is really cool. I watched some Top Gear at one of my English friend's flats in London, and it's just really enjoyable. The question was still - wait, is this what I should be doing with my time? Couldn't I be enjoying myself while also learning, or producing something, or connecting more deeply with someone I like? It's a keenly thought out thing that I made a conscious decision about a long time, but I'm not one of those horrible anti-TV preachy people. If it serves a role in a person's life and they're happy with its effect, then it's a good thing for them.",1265812588

Video gaming has that weird addictive drive to it for some people that I do not think is healthy. You might like good wine but you don't drink wine 8 hours a day. You don't obsessively consume every good bottle of wine you own. You don't sit around stressing out about not consuming and finishing enough wine. If you do these things you're not a wine lover; you're an alcoholic.<p>I think rabid video game fans should consider this point strongly. Part of having good taste is being selective because it's impossible to consume everything. Are these all good games? Maybe but you have a finite amount of time in your life. You need to plan accordingly. It may include making tough choices like playing video game X instead of video game Y but you'll survive and your life won't be significantly worse off no matter what choice you make.",1265811433

That being the case, it's no problem to remove each node from the cluster in turn, upgrade the kernel, reboot, test and add it back in.<p>That rather makes the service more of a convenience.  For example, for active/passive setups where a failover produces an undesirable amount of downtime (say 30 seconds whilst services migrate), or single server setups where uptime isn't critical, but downtime is still a pain.<p>Cool technology, but perhaps an example of a solution looking for a problem.

It would make more sense for the industry as a whole to allow the copying of design, because overall it saves on design work time.<p>What Curebit did appears to be wrong because it appears as though they are outright cheating. However, if you understand that designers gain their chops by reverse-engineering the productions of others, and that this happens routinely in the real world, perhaps it's time to accept copying as a legitimate part of the equation.<p>In this case, 37Signals was given free rein to track Curebit's customers.

So what number you're dealing with depends on the team. Sometimes you have eight engineers but only four of them are doing something major at any given time.<p>Of course, whatever you call what you deploy to production -- master, production, timestamp tagging, etc -- it should ideally pass CI before getting deployed as well. And there are merge conflicts to deal with, too -- that ideally belongs to whoever's doing branching.<p>So, maybe my ideal workflow looks like this:<p><pre><code>  * Branch away from master
  * As you work in your branch, grab a CI server if you feel like it (telling
    everyone else)
  * Commit code in your branch, keeping an eye on your CI as you go
  * Periodically merge in from master, dealing with merge conflicts in your branch,
    *not* in master
  * When you feel like it's ready to go, get whatever review you feel like you
    need -- code review, product manager review, etc
  * If you feel 99% certain it's good, merge it into master and push that back to
    origin
  * Wait for master CI to pass
  * Deploy to production
  * Beer
</code></pre>
From an etiquette point of view, there are things that can go wrong, not least the individual commitment to deal with merge conflicts before they get involved in master. And conflict resolution cannot be rushed. If you have engineers who are just gonna edit files randomly to get git to accept their merge, you're going to have problems.

3523675,comment,3523024,3523349,7,0,tzs,,,"You are confusing everyday English with court pleadings. Here are some illustrative examples to show the difference.<p>1. You come home from work, and find that while you were gone someone came into your garage and stole your motorcycle.<p>It would be quite normal to exclaim ""I've been robbed!"". Yet you in fact have been burgled, not robbed. Nevertheless in common English usage people use ""robbed"" in a more expansive sense than it is use in law. If writing a police report, or an indictment, one must make the distinction, but not in regular conversation.<p>2. You are in a bar, in a tuxedo, obviously trying to drink yourself into oblivion. I ask you what is wrong. You tell me ""my best friend stole my fianc...on our wedding day!"".<p>Technically, he did not steal her, as she is not property. He perhaps committed tortious interference with contract, or maybe alienation of affection. However, if you are not writing the pleadings for a lawsuit, it is in fact perfectly acceptable to say the bastard stole your fianc.<p>3. You are the quarterback for your high school football team. The big game is coming up with your most hated rival high school. Your sister starts dating the quarterback of their time. While he is at your house visiting your system, he sneaks into your room, where you have your team's confidential playbook. He quickly uses his cell phone camera to take photos of each page.<p>This would generally be described as him stealing your plays, even though it is not legally stealing (and probably isn't even legally a crime).<p>The use of terms like stealing, theft, robbery, and so on to describe situations where they do not literally apply in the legal sense goes back a long way. E.g., from Shakespeare: ""Who steals my purse, steals trash, but he that filches from me my good name robs me of that which not enriches him and makes me poor indeed."" Note that he is using both filching (a synonym for stealing) and robbery to describe damaging a reputation.<p>Copyright law's mechanism is to create a property interest in the right to make and distribute copies of a given work. Exercising someone else's property interests without there permission is acceptably called ""theft"" in ordinary English.",1327792186

  o Thicker border on center rectangle
  o Offset rectangle in center
  o Black /  Same shade of blue for the Name, description of price.

  o Quoted endorsement below the statement of confidence.

It's not illegal, or even particularly immoral - what it is is shady, and unprofessional behavior by anybody who wanted to be able to work as a well-regarded designer.  Whoever did that work didn't have a lot of self respect as a designer - and, based on the professional designers that I know - probably didn't consider themselves to be first and foremost a designer.   Probably an engineer who had to slap some UI elements onto their website.

You could almost overlay them.<p>It was successful.

2900409,comment,2899692,2899692,15,0,akeefer,,,"One thing my company has done since way back in its startup days (we're pretty successful at this point) is put an emphasis on working reasonable hours, and it's been successful for us.  Some people still choose to work long hours because they're excited about what they're working on, but it's not expected or asked of anyone.  There were two reasons for doing that even as a startup, and I think they're both still valid.<p>Reason #1 is that working long hours often becomes an excuse to not prioritize properly.  Working under realistic constraints forces you to really decide whether some feature is worth it, or if spending 40 hours on Feature A is better than spending 40 hours in Features B, C, and D combined.  Too often the answer at companies is, ""Well, A, B, C, and D are all really important, so just work harder and do everything.""  That's a very seductive trap to fall into, but it's absolutely the wrong escape valve.  At least in my view a failure to focus and prioritize properly is far more often a cause of failure for startups than ""we didn't work hard enough.""<p>Reason #2 is that you want to avoid burning people out if you expect to be around for the long haul.  Our company just turned 10, and we still have a surprising number of long-tenured engineers, which I'd attribute in large part to the work environment and the relative sanity of the work/life balance people can have.  If you expect people to work 60+ hours a week every week, they're not going to stick around for 10 years; they're going to get burned out and bored and they'll feel like the only way to get a break is to quit.<p>You can quibble with the second reason, but I think that even in a situation where you feel like you have to get a ton done and working 40 hours a week isn't an option, it's very important not to use ""we'll just work harder"" as an excuse to avoid making the hard decisions around priorities.",1313691986

It's also possible that someone would buy it and use it for a business or personal use and then it would actually either not be available at all at any price for you or you'd have to pay more money for the name then a squatter would have charged.<p>Here's another different example.\nSomeone buys up land near a proposed hiway exit. And then they hold out until a fast food chain wants to buy the land for the restaurant and pay the price that a large corporation can pay for that type of land. Somebody made money on that transaction. But the small restaurant is upset because ""all the good land is taken by squatters and I can't locate my restaurant there because I can't pay the price what gives them the right to charge me all that money."".<p>Does that make sense?",1313691940

I think that is in part because there are no open source projects of the complexity and scale of what Google builds and thus those teams haven't run into the problems that Google did and had to come up with their own ways to work around them.<p>When I worked there Google had 20,000 employees. More than half of them were engineers, and probably at any given moment in time 5,000 unique users might type 'build' at their desktop after having checked in a change. That means 5,000 instances get build, 5,000 regression test suites run, following at least 5,000 different 'views' into the repository. (which sat one some Perforce servers that nearly glowed from all the work they were being asked to do).<p>There are few places where such scale is needed, perhaps a couple of dozen, and they all have competent engineers so they all come up with their own build system.<p>If open source were ever to address this particular challenge, it would have to be in the creation of some really solid interfaces which would allow a build system to emerge from the tools, rather than trying to explicitly create a build system from scratch.",1313691939

Even if they /do/ drop existing ones, what is the behavior of the client?<p>Example: you just stated, and this even seems reasonable, that if the underlying TCP connection ""is terminated prematurely you probably want to restart the connection automatically"": but as that will cause other peoples' connections to fail, that will just lead to a connection storm.<p>In fact, this is a serious issue that I'm really glad this person has brought up, as I really hadn't seen this be highlighted in any previous conversations on this subject (although, I will happily admit that I don't read all of them, so it may be discussed every Tuesday on the WebSockets mailing list for all I know ;P).",1313691852

The difficulty with making large Rainbow Tables is not the storage space, but the time necessary to create the initial table.  Faster GPU's make Rainbow Tables more effective for large password spaces, not less.  The size of the table can be arbitrarily reduced by using longer chains.  The real limiting factor is the time to generate the initial table, which is comparable to making a single brute force search.<p>The theory is beyond my ability to explain, but as a practical example, this page might be useful: <a href=""http://ophcrack.sourceforge.net/tables.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ophcrack.sourceforge.net/tables.php</a><p>It's not an exact match up, but look at ""Vista 7"" table.

Since Erlang has no user-defined data types, you don't have to worry about redefining a class. (Big problem with Python reloading, all existing objects still belong to the old class instance.) Since Erlang is structured in terms of processes, and OTP can track which process is which thing, OTP has a defined mechanism for taking running server processes, examining their state, and allowing you to upgrade from old states to new states cleanly, and since in Erlang a process is basically nothing but its call stack and its current state, that upgrade is complete and relatively safe. You can literally upgrade a server mid-TCP connection without the client knowing.<p>Most languages, if poked properly, can change code at runtime. Even C can unload a dynamic library and load a new version of it at runtime. It's just that mutable values and poorly-defined boundaries between systems make it range from effectively impossible through ""usable only as a desparate hack"" (as seen here), Erlang makes it production-quality.<p>I say this only for educational purposes, not advocacy per se. I'd like to see further understanding of how Erlang works so that other language communities are more likely to pick up on the essential features of Erlang, instead of getting stuck on the superficial ones which is the usual case.

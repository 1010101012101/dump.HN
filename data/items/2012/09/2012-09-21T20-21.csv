It is possible to not have data being forwarded through a third party server (after all what is the idea behind STUN, TURN and similar methods?  the goal is NAT traversal not forwarding traffic) so your point about snooping being an issue for _any_ decentralized network seems moot.  Tent might not be the solution you'd like, but that doesn't mean the very notion of decentralized networks is bogus.  The internet started as one.  Then we added ""too many layers of crap"" because the whole thing was a hack from the beginning, duct tape and chicken wire, and for some reason users can't be trusted to use an open network responsibly.  Now we have to add more layers just to get back to the original idea.

Realistically, though, they <i>can't</i> bully the U.S.  They aren't capable of posing much of a threat, and they aren't popular with the American people or with the international community, so the U.S. is free to retaliate (proportionately or disproportionately) against serious aggression.

They want to minimize international support for potential Israeli aggression, and they don't want to make it any easier for the U.S. to get other nations on board with the economic sanctions.

4555692,comment,4554192,4554682,8,0,ColinWright,,,"This sounds profound, but is wrong on so many levels.  In a sense everything about mathematics is arbitrary, but there's a consistency and structure that makes such a statement unhelpful and misleading.<p>Consider.<p>If you're content with the counting numbers then we can construct the negative numbers.  These have the specific property that when added to the positive number of the same size we get zero,<p>But most people are happy with the integers, so move on.  We're reasonably happy with addition, but what is multiplication?  If you think of it as repeated addition you're screwed when you want to multiply by 2 1/2.  It's better to think of it as a scaling.  Multiplying by 2 means that you scale things up to be twice as big.  Thus 1 goes to 2, 2 goes to 4, and 5 goes to 10.  Also, -1 goes to -2, -6 goes to -12, and so on.<p>So what do we mean  when we scale by -1?  We look at the sequence of scaling by 4, then by 3, then by 2, and so on, each time asking where the number 1 gets sent.<p><pre><code>    Scale by 4 and 1 -> 4
    Scale by 3 and 1 -> 3
    Scale by 2 and 1 -> 2
    Scale by 1 and 1 -> 1
    Scale by 0 and 1 -> 0
</code></pre>
Following this progression we see that it's natural in some sense to say that scaling by -1 means that 1goes to -1.  And indeed, 2 goes to -2, and 73 goes to -73.<p>Scaling by -1 sends something to the same distance on the other side of zero.<p>So where does -1 get sent under a scaling of -1?  It gets sent the same distance the other side of zero.  -1 gets sent to 1.<p>Therefore it makes sense to say that -1 scaled by -1 is 1.<p>(-1) * (-1) = 1<p>Wecan use this to ask about the square root of -1.  What geometric operation can we perform on the number line, such that doing it twice is the same as multiplying by -1?<p>An answer is to rotate anti-clockwise by 90 degrees.  Another answer is to rotate clockwise by 90 degrees.<p>Pursue this, and you start to construct the Agrand diagram, and the complex numbers.",1348260425

Therefore, with the two options that we are apparently forced into, the group is doomed regardless. It's only a matter of time. I say forced into two options because of the artificial restriction that the people cannot leave the room, which was not stated in the original explanation. Another out would be for the group to kill the visionary once he started back to doing the bad thing, remember that this damages them, which showed he could not be trusted and did not care for the well-being of the other people in the room. Is that not an option as well? In the end, the only choice the people had to fit their best interests was to leave the room, unless you can justify the murder of the visionary. But you took that away and I'm led to believe that they have no other options, so in the end they are all doomed regardless of either choice they go with.<p>Changing the rules, or adding new rules as I respond, to change the thought experiment is not a good way to invalidate my conclusion. For instance, equating a room with the Earth doesn't work for me, that's different situations with different potential outcomes with different options. The bad thing in a room thought experiment, as presented, is simply a bad example if there are only two options allowed.<p>Now, if we're talking about a situation you are describing, where the outcome is not damaging to the people involved, except for maybe their sanity, then I can somewhat agree with what you're saying.",1348260131

The point is that you can start with nothing, and define the set that has nothing in it.  That's {}.  Now we have one thing.  We can define a set containing that, so we have { {} }.

</code></pre>
So what is your question?  You seem to be saying that when you write down ""0.99999..."" that is intended to represent the limit of the sequence 0.9, 0.99, 0.999, ...  Define what you mean by limit.  Once you make a careful definition of ""limit"" wou find that the limit of the above sequence is 1.<p><pre><code>  >> Call that collection A

</code></pre>
Sack A has a cube with the number 1 written on it.  And it has a cube with the number 2 written on it.  And it has a cube with the number 3 written on it.  And it has a cube with the number 4 written on it.  And it has a cube with the number 5 written on it.  And so on.<p><pre><code>  > I understand what happens on a given cube,

I assume you mean a cube in sack B.<p><pre><code>  > ... and that cubes in sack A are numbered 1 though infinity.
</code></pre>
You can't say that with precision, because it is infinity you are struggling with.  What you can say is that for every number n there is a cube with n on it, and that every cube has exactly one number written on it.<p>This level of detail matters.<p><pre><code>  > Is there anything to say about the numbers written on

Yes - they're different.<p><pre><code>  > Basically what you are saying is that sac A cannot have

No.  I'm saying I have two collections of objects.  I have very carefully defined what these objects are.  And I'm saying that you cannot pair them off, one-to-one, without having things from sack B left over.<p><pre><code>  > I am not sure why that is.

Without the advice I've read here, I doubt I'd of lasted the four months I have so far...<p>The hardest part of this ""charge more"" philosophy is finding the clients. For example, I went to see a client yesterday, who knew my daily rate. We had a very positive meeting and I was told ""they were glad they'd found the right man for the job"". Yet today they stated they could get two developers for the price I was charging and would have to think about hiring me unless I was prepared to negotiate.<p>I do wonder if maybe the world of freelance developing does have a payment cap, and that to reach the next level we need to sell ourselves as something other than just developers.<p>Or does making the charge more philosophy work to its full extent in the development game, mean joining big company x, or selling my soul to big company y.<p>The question I'm asking myself right now is. Would Patio11 be able to charge the same rate as a freelance developer as he does as a ""I will help you sell more software"" freelance consultant?",1348257740

You could get a similar amount of code in Java using something like FunctionalJava but that's not really a fair comparison, because patio11 is illustrating Java as it's spotted in the wild, and thus so am I. But with appropriate libraries and implementation patterns you can certainly write concise Java if you so choose.",1348257722

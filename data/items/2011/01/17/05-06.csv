2111372,comment,2110508,2111290,0,0,barrkel,,,"The problem in ASTs is worse because it's not just the functions that have types getting rippled through them, but it's the types themselves; some processing function f maps AST_0 to AST_1, then g maps AST_1 to AST_2, but the vast majority of the nodes in AST_0..AST_2 are the same, only augmented; but you want to verify that the right nodes got eliminated / transformed. I've ended up taking (a) dynamic, explicitly checked approaches to the type safety issue of making sure only the right nodes turn up in the right ASTs, and (b) writing code generators to deal with the type repetition that ends up being needed in languages that don't have the right amount of expressiveness in the type system.<p>Even when the type system is expressive enough, carrying around all the type arguments can be painful, even if you have higher kinded types. It makes one want a statically typed Lisp with a macro preprocessing step, or something.",1295243877

But for groups, interviews and telephone calls it becomes harder. I also have to know what language you are using. If I guess that wrong, and even if you are using a language I know, I can hardly make out what you are saying.

You can't make all your friends in your own industry. I don't care if a person is a man or a woman, unless there are seriously extenuating circumstance I won't work or socialize with them if their assholes. The problem is that in geek circles there is a heavy social penalty of advocating that someone be ostracized for behaving like an asshole, everyone has to be included no matter how much no one else wants to hang out with them.<p>There are a lot of anti-social retards in tech regardless of gender. I'm quite happy with it as there are lots of people willing to hire devs who are willing to not be condescending and have some semblance of adherence to social norms. As the OP pointed out quite accurately in their post 'I realized he was just an asshole who probably wouldn't get too far in life anyways.'<p>Many people are hardwired to respect the opinion of anyone who forcefully and confidently expresses it. It's a two way street though, want people to think you know software engineering or any other topic? Just say something reasonably intelligent in a forceful and confident way, also if someone else has said it that they respect mention that person as having saying it. Most of the debates in software engineering are subjective in nature as much as everyone involved in the decision likes to claim otherwise.<p>If you know your rhetoric you'll have no problem intellectually disarming most people in CS. CS geeks think they only pay attention to logos but realistically there are a lot of CS decisions made based on ethos and pathos. I'll probably be down modded for saying this but the appeal of open source is based largely in ethos and pathos, and not logos.<p>I'd settle for more people in tech who can write working code with out being an asshole regardless of gender.",1295243354

2111352,comment,2111278,2111278,0,0,cd34,,,"I had an employee for four years that was deaf.  Deafness came for him at an early age due to a very advanced infection - I don't recall, but, perhaps Spinal Meningitis. Possibly able to get the cochlear implant, but, doctors gave it a very low chance for success. It was thought he would never walk, he never went to a special school.  He could read lips well and could verbalize some things.<p>As an employer, it wasn't too bad.  He telecommuted, so, most conversations were over ICQ.  However, at times dealing through Florida Relay was troublesome.  He did go to Linux and PHP user groups from time to time, but, mostly to meet people for contact later.  He was a T9 SMS rocket.  At times, communicating very complex thoughts when we were face to face ended up with me typing in a terminal window or writing on a legal pad.  We didn't meet face to face frequently, and I did learn some ASL - only to find out that he didn't know ASL.  He got into his late 30s-early 40s without ever using ASL and it didn't seem to bother him.<p>Interviewing him face to face was a little difficult, but, I brought pen and paper as I had dealt with deaf clients in the past while consulting.  I had a prepared offer letter with me - just needed to fill in the amount.<p>We communicated quite a bit over ICQ about non work-related issues and he never really seemed to want to change much.  He just wanted to work in a small office or out of his home, collect a paycheck, play xbox/ps3 and that was that.<p>So, the fact that you want to do something puts you a step ahead in the game.  Many people, deaf or not, don't like groups. In fact, I would bet a large proportion of the readers here resist groups except with very like-minded people.  I think ambition outweighs shyness.  The desire to succeed will push you to do things that you might feel are initially uncomfortable, but, after a while, you'll adapt.<p>To make an idea a reality, it should be no different between us.  You need to design your MVP (Minimum Viable Product), potentially code it, get people interested and using it.  On the Internet, most communication with clients isn't verbal.  Working in a pairs environment or finding a partner that will work with you might be a little more challenging, but, I would suspect you should really have that much difficulty.  I know plenty of people that intensely dislike talking on the phone and prefer instant messaging, email, IRC, etc.<p>At the point it comes time to pitch your idea to get further funding, you will probably hit a roadblock that will be much more difficult.  With Florida Relay, it was very difficult to detect passion - and by passion I mean the belief in an idea, the excitement of discovering a new solution, etc.  Investors use verbal cues to detect how well you understand an idea or how well you'll be able to adapt to change or how much you believe in the idea.  A translator just might not convey that as well which means your idea probably needs to be more technically sophisticated, documented, or thought out.<p>I don't really think you'll run into too many issues that any other reader here isn't going to encounter.  Get your idea together, write a skeleton document, figure out what it takes to get from point A to B, develop an MVP yourself or with someone else, launch it, figure out where to go from there.",1295243326

It could have been a student film, in some ways.  I thought many of the characters were fairly two-dimensional and the ""two lawsuit"" structure was a little forced.   It made me think of the examples in a screenwriting class I took in college.  (Oh, and it's not a world I live in or aspire to live in.)  My expectations must have been too high after all of the great press it received.  It had so many raving critics and fans that I had a long period of people telling me I ""had to see it"" - but I didn't see it until it came out on DVD and then was fairly disappointed.

Ironically, my ""non-valley"" friends saw the movie in a completely opposite light - which, too some degree, is a huge credit to the great direction, acting and screen play.  So many people could see precisely the same movie, and come out with entirely different conclusions.

And, as I understand it, redis is specifically designed to work with data that fits in memory, which is definitely a limitation that will prevent its use in a lot of places.<p>It strikes me that redis has some cool concepts...but you can't just wave your arms around and say that because redis is a memory-based database it solves I/O and performance problems of databases that normally operate in larger than memory deployments. If redis falls apart when memory can't contain the entire data set, that's a limitation, not a feature.<p>Since I know Tokyo Tyrant (and its successor or sibling or whatever, Kyoto Tycoon) are blisteringly fast in memory only workloads using key-value datasets, I'm highly suspicious of claims that redis is naturally and obviously faster (or something...I can't tell if this is a claim of speed, or architectural superiority because redis somehow solves I/O in a different way, I can't tell from the slides what is claimed, really).<p>Personally, I'd like to see some more meat to the argument that redis is superior, or at least some clarity about <i>when</i> and <i>why</i> redis is superior.

2111319,comment,2110227,2110227,13,0,schacon,,,"I'll probably write a blog post laying this out a bit more clearly, but responding to a few of the comments here:<p>* I don't think 'rock star' programmers is important.  I think that most programmers got into the game because they love programming, not because it's what they <i>have</i> to do. There are exceptions, but I believe that more programmers love doing it then have to do it.  The point is to setup an environment where you as an employer can get the most out of people of a range of talent simply by setting up an environment that motivates in the best way possible - through autonomy, mastery and purpose.  I think people that don't seem passionate will become more passionate if given the freedom.<p>* to be clear, i said every 'developer' makes the same.  or, better said, every role makes the same - there are roles that make different amounts, but it's still pretty flat and people are not individually offered different salaries by some subjective determination of their merit, but rather equally by the general role they are hired to do.  it so happens that most of our employees are either developers or designers and they're all paid the same out of simplicity.  the main point is that salary is less important than environment.<p>* finally, i'm not saying that the way that github does it is the way that you should do it - we have the difference of the C-suite being open source developers, so it's easier for us.  the point is that even this somewhat radical example works surprisingly well, and that if you try to optimize for autonomy and purpose in the lives and working environment of your developers that it will most likely result in a much more productive output.<p>again, i'll try to do a more comprehensive post on what i specifically was talking about, rather then just the slides out of context, but i wanted to quickly address some of the comments.  thanks!  also, it was a blast doing the keynote, so thanks to everyone that attended and argued about it after.",1295242158

A parent would download the game, hand the device to the kid, and the kid would be free to make as many in-app purchases (or other games?) as he/she wanted. Someone got a bill in the thousands and complained.<p>Apple changed it so password entry for paid content must be re-entered for each purchase. Free apps and updates still required password to download, but honored the 15 minute window. With iOS 6, updates do not require the password at all.

Since I have cards that have no foreign transaction fees, I am guessing it will not be beneficial for myself.

4695960,comment,4695295,4695579,4,0,jonnathanson,,,"To me, the implication here is that you can no longer bank everything on one title. Your first title may need to be a loss leader for a second and third title, to follow shortly thereafter. Hopefully you build a fanbase with the first title, and you try to convert those fans to the subsequent games. This is not cheap, by any means, and for true garage-style indies, it will mean either raising some capital, partnering with others who have it, or being incredibly savvy with PR and guerrilla marketing. Or it may mean a really long, slow strategy, building up a loyal following over the course of a few years. (That's the way a lot of fledgling studios had to do it in the early console days, and it may be similar in the future.)<p>The niche strategy is the other option. I've seen certain niches that have really loyal, under-served fanbases with deep pockets and a high willingness to pay for quality. Take the RPG segment, for instance. Square-Enix (an 800lb gorilla, sure, but still) recently released an RPG for a whopping <i>$30</i> on the iOS App Store, and by all accounts, it seems to be very successful. I'm sure you can measure the number of people who paid for it in the hundreds of thousands, and probably not the millions, but still, that's a successful launch. A small, hyper-loyal niche without much price sensitivity can be the basis of a very lucrative strategy.",1351129371

He also clearly expected that if there were problems, your ""Expert Wordpress Support"" would provide the solutions.

I don't know what the tone/implication in Seans message about the ~188k row sort was, but from reading your defence here I can't help but think there was at least a bit of ""you're doing it wrong!"" - which even when it's true, it's not the wording you want to feed an unhappy customer.<p>(Note: this is written as a happy WPE user, with some curiosity about exactly what went wrong, and why some guy with a Linode VPS can, in some cases, keep a Wordpress site up better then WPE.

Though we shouldn't dwell too much on the quality of the diagnosis, the fact that we have news organizations filtering our data should make us skeptical about the link between the island and his apparent recovery.",1351127264

As a result, almost no terminals in the US have a chip reader.<p>A PIN is used to authenticate swiped (magstripe) transactions from a debit card. That said, swiped transactions from a credit card only require a signature -- though many terminals have been upgraded to also require the billing ZIP (postal) code. Most debit cards can also be run as credit cards, effectively bypassing the PIN check.<p>NFC-enabled terminals (and the cards to go with them) are slowly starting to appear, but even those don't require a PIN. Just a signature.",1351127248

Of course not, that's why I want <i>both</i>. Having to choose which version of my files to use is annoying, manually syncing or having to write/install something to do it automatically is worse. You've definitely lost ""the normals"" at that point. No, just proactively sync my changes.",1351126970

Not every programmer sees their individual contributions as a stepping stone to becoming a manager, so why would it be any different with starting a company? I see no reason to begrudge someone for doing what they love, no matter their age.",1351126936

Getting your teeth cleaned is awfully hard to outsource, considering your teeth generally cannot be removed from your mouth and picked up or dropped off.<p>If you're just talking about, ""we come to you"", that doesn't seem like a real compelling service. Dentist visits are rare and important, so I'm willing to invest a little more, and it seems like dentistry in the back of a truck would be limited. Much of the equipment at a dentist's office can't exactly be thrown into a truck.",1351126907

But my experience is that the majority of startups will be fine.  The problem is much more rarely ""The engineers are getting away with murder!"" and more commonly ""I told those engineers everything they were supposed to be doing with no deviations.  Why aren't they listening to me?!""  Most startup founders (but by no means all) end up being such control freaks that Joel's advice probably won't be dangerous.",1329173918

On a 2011 15"", I can run Ubuntu fullscreen seamlessly (literally swipe left and right between Mac and Ubuntu, with no cursor capturing or anything). I think it's the best way to get full usage out of your Mac while still using Linux - and you can setup shared folders between Mac and your VM, or SSH from one to the other.<p>I don't see OSX as being an additional cost like Windows - all Macs come with OSX, and it doesn't have to license it from a separate company, like the Dell and Microsoft relationship. The only cost would be $30 every other year for upgrades, but even those are optional.<p>A refurb definitely wouldn't be a bad option, I have a refurbed iMac and if it didn't come in a brown box saying ""Refurbished"" I'd have never known.

In fact, I believe that Reddit should always make the best effort to comport itself to US law in order to protect the site's existence for its users everywhere. However, I am saying that CP is not the only possible legal threat and it is naive to assume that it will continue to be the dominant legal threat going forward.<p><i>Contrast, as you seem to want to, with /r/trees. How many posts in /r/trees get taken down due to their questionable legality? How many posts in /r/letstradetorrents (apocryphal) get taken down due to their questionable legality? None and none. The nature of CP on the Internet is unique, and not viewed similarly to anything else on the Internet. Reddit isn't saying ""as long as it doesn't represent a plausible legal threat that can be waged against them"", they're saying, ""as long as it's not CP, and as long as it's manageable through an ad-hoc process.""</i><p>I agree that it is not yet a problem. Reddit has not yet been taken down by the FBI because of widespread drug trade on r/trees. Nor have they been sued because of torrent links. What I question is how long it will take before these things become issues?<p>What I'm asking is: what is it about CP that makes it the only possible legal threat that Reddit can face? Reddit is still a maturing community that can evolve in many different ways. Reddit's policy is <i>not</i> about CP specifically, it's about credible legal threat. This is not what they say, but what they mean. If you think otherwise, I invite you to tell me what they will do if a non-CP related legal threat comes along.",1329173399

Note that frost heaving can exert a force of 14,000PSI and you better hope your wall is big enough.<p>Modern built homes in cold climates (where I live, Canada) rely on footings below the frost line (so your house doesn't split in two or more pieces), the basement floor and first floor joists to supply the lateral forces to resist the freezing soil.

3587515,comment,3586883,3587391,21,0,SiVal,,,"I remember the joy of saying goodbye to the limits of BASIC when I switched to C. Ah, the power, the control....<p>After a while, I was sick of debugging memory and having to rely on ""libraries"" just to do anything useful with strings, and it was such a relief to discover Perl. Talk about power! I was suddenly creating little utility programs for everything. It occurred to me that I could have been writing these utilities in C all along but I never did because the time to write and debug them was more than the time they would have saved. What a joy to discover Perl (which then led into learning the Unix command line and its utilities.)<p>But after a while, I noticed how often I still had to look up the ""clever"" syntax of Perl. There were so many other ways to do things that I couldn't read other people's Perl without a reference book beside me and, heaven help me, sometimes I couldn't even read my own. That had never happened in C, But I wanted to create commercial GUI apps. Perl's answer? Use Tk? Yeah, right.<p>So, I switched to C++ for GUI apps, and what a treat to have that kind of power compared to Perl. But then I rediscovered memory debugging, what it's like to not have a string datatype, and I learned that the usefulness of OOP was offset by all the ridiculous little gotchas that meant you always had irreproducible bugs that you hadn't yet discovered.<p>What a relief when Java came out. Almost all the power of C++, plus built-in strings, arrays, even Unicode, but without most of the hidden gotchas. I could concentrate on the demands of the problem instead of the demands of C++. Like lots of programmers, I found Java much more fun than C++.<p>But of course there were things I missed--structs, enums, regular expressions, GUI apps that looked native--and every time I complained to Sun reps in a meeting, they would simply explain to me that they knew more about programming languages than I did, and they knew that I didn't really need these things. They held that position (""No, trust us, you don't really want that"") for years.<p>But the Microsoft reps were always EXTREMELY interested in anything we wanted from Java but that Sun wouldn't give us. ""What do you wish Java had and how would you use it?"" They took lots of notes. Superb marketing.<p>When C# was released, it was with great relief that I finally got the language, native GUI app builder, and other things I'd been longing for in Java for so long.<p>Building GUI apps with C# is still a joy, but I'm always frustrated at being limited to Windows. I use Macs and Linux boxes, too, and Mono has never quite been what I had hoped for. I need to do a lot of web programming, cross-platform number crunching, and all sorts of things. And having to (repeatedly) buy all of those Microsoft tools and be a ""registered developer"" and all that nonsense, phooey!<p>Thank goodness, I found Python. Free, available on every platform, great built-ins AND great libraries.... Like Perl, but with a syntax I remember without looking things up. I can read other people's code without a reference.<p>But I wish it had the flexibility and macros of Lisp, the power I've found in functional programming, the easy GUI creator of C#, the speed of C... and a pony.<p>I understand the OP's feeling of relief at leaving annoyances behind. Believe me, I do. Every system I've used has had problems I'm glad to rid of and features I still miss. But that's what you get when you change a relationship, move to a new house, sell your car, get a new job. And, with programming languages, you can go back when you need to.<p>It's often good to move on, but it doesn't mean what you left behind was bad. Sometimes you just need different problems.",1329170485

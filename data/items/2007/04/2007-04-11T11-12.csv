That doesn't say anything about the creativity going on, though - it only means that the search engine is broken. I tend to read about interesting places in Second Life in blogs. Several web pages try to address the search problem for Second Life, too. <p>At the times when I was just trying my luck with the internal search engine, I found interesting places, too. Many of them were abandoned, that is true, but that doesn't imply that they were boring. <p>What would you do as a first time user of the World Wide Web? Would you be able to find interesting web pages right away?",1176291919
11816,comment,11665,11665,0,0,Hexayurt,,,"I have a US govt. contract to develop an ultra-low-cost biometric digital ID system with strong privacy features. As I've mentioned before, my work is patent free, groundbreaking, and could easily spawn half a dozen companies.<p>We'll be looking for commercial partners to take the prototype and turn it into a production system in about three months and - because we're working patent free - odds are I could help you get started on this if you're interested in being able to bid as a vendor when the time comes.<p>Identity is a basic human necessity - if nobody knows who you are, you can't get credit, service, you can't vote - and the RFID approach has vast problems, mainly it's reliance on massive centralized databases because the cheap ID tag only holds 128 bits or whatever. We've seen a compromise of the US identity system produce both identity theft and the 50,000 or so black people who were <i>misidentified</i> as felons in the 2000 election in Florida, so it's not like there's not a reason (and a market) for solving these problems.<p>Distributed systems with appropriate cryptography offer a good balance between liberty, security and privacy. That's the approach we're taking.<p>I see this work very much as a continuation of my work on the hexayurt refugee shelter system: <a href=""http://appropedia.org/Hexayurt_Project/"">http://appropedia.org/Hexayurt_Project/</a><p>Eventual deployment platform is LiveCD-based Linux and mobile phones. hexayurt@gmail.com<p>Odds-are that for conflict of interest reasons, I'd be able to brief you and point you in the right direction, but not be a partner or get paid on this. I'd be on the other side of the fence, on the .gov end of the deal.",1176290668

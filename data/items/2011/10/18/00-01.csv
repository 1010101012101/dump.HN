Obviously some people where using it as an investment (which is kind of a store of value), but probably not the same people.<p>Anyway, a currency that people buy to use in particular markets is possibly a way that money got started in the first place. People traded for a currency to use in a (physical) market and then traded that into different stuff that day. Eventually, as things stabilized they might have been happy holding some money.<p>If bitcoin became commonly used as a way of transacting, but not of storing value or denominating prices it could still be a good enough starting point.",1318899557

In the 70's they said we had 20-30 years of oil left.   They were right: we've basically run out of $10-20 oil, although Saudi Arabia still has some of that.   But $100 oil?   We've got enough of that to last this century, at least.

3123255,comment,3119518,3123088,2,0,guelo,,,"Do you ever stop and wonder why it is that your ideology so closely aligns exactly with everything that the big corps and banks want? You want deregulation just like the big polluters do, you want lower taxes just like the richest want, you want to remove any policing of business activities, guess who doesn't want business activities to be policed? The fantasy that the banking meltdown was caused by Fannie or some laws passed 30 years ago don't even pass the smell test. For some reason you can't imagine that it had anything to do with the banking deregulation passed in 2000. Somehow anything that might benefit the lower and middle class is a threat but we must keep the most powerful on the dole.<p>By the way you are distancing yourself from ""conservatives"" I'm guessing you are one of the self-proclaimed libertarians. But as far as the practical economical results it's the same crap, policies that end up making the powerful even more powerful than they are now.<p>I'm not assuming that you are evil, and I don't have some simplistic view of the world that you are attributing to me. But there are people that are taking advantage of the rest of us and we should be fighting it. We all live in a world flooded by propaganda coming at us from all sides so I always try to give people some leeway when arguing politics, and I try to stay informed on opinions opposed to mine. It is hard to break free from pre-concieved notions.<p>The liberal vs conservative (or libertarian) debate  on economics has been about whether the bigger villain are big corps or big government. But I think what the new realization dawning on millions of people, especially those that thought Obama would fight against the plutocrats, is that they are both part of the same corrupt and broken system. You want to break apart big government, fine, but why don't you also want to break up the big banks and other monopolies?",1318899291

Application sends the fob a challenge, fob responds. Application validates the response and proceeds. Perhaps the key uses 2.4mhz wireless, perhaps it uses bluetooh (a protocoled 2.4mhz wireless solution :-). The benefit is that these things can only occur when you're key is present.

This is a growing problem, its getting more expensive, and like some digital herpes my expectation is that it is going to pop out suddenly in boils of financial putritude dripping pain, financial suffering, and expense for everyone involved. With luck we'll fix it before then but most folks who are getting burned are more interested in covering it up rather than addressing it sadly.<p>I think it would be wonderful to have a possible solution prototyped and demonstrable for people in pain. Your passwords will be compromised, and if you do anything financial online you will have money vanish and you will experience arguing with a bank as to why they should give it back to you and take the loss.

However, to not lose your email address itself, you have to have your own domain, but is that really sufficient? In the end, you mostly lease it rather than owning it, so can it just be assumed that a .com address won't be messed with (as long as there aren't any trademark issue)? (as opposed to, say, a .ly)<p>Do you use your own domain for email? Do you think that email addresses have some inherent risks that make them <i>potentially</i> disposable after 5-10 years?<p>A bigger question is how could anyone (that is: people who have currently no idea what a domain really is and how to get one) take control of their addresses in a similar way?<p>As far as I'm concerned, I haven't used my own domain yet for emails but my alumni association gives me a lifelong forwarding address. I haven't been super strict with using it everywhere though, so it's a bit all over the place.

Eventually you run out of new people to interest in the stock, and the price tops out.<p>If someone buys it at the peak and holds it, at some point they will either sell it for a loss, or they will hold onto it ""forever"" which ties up that money for them and effectively makes it a total loss.<p>In addition, in order to drive the price up, people are choosing to commit money to <i>that</i> purpose and not others.  Competitors' stocks will fall.  Other types of investments won't be done.<p><i>Clearly, it's a game of hot potato where you don't want to be stuck holding the bag, so you play musical chairs and end up changing horses mid-stream.</i><p>Let's assume someone has a foreign banknote and doesn't know what it's worth (it's a one dollar bill).  He sells it for 20 cents; the next person sells it for 40 cents; and so on.  Whoever buys it at a dollar is making a lateral trade unless he finds a sucker.<p>Anyone who left money on the table is essentially profit-sharing with the next person.  In order to make your profit, you had to GET the money from someone else who <i>already had it</i>.<p>When you sell your $400 stock, someone else buys it, with the express purpose of having an asset that appreciates fast enough to outpace inflation.<p>It's kind of like the rake in a poker game.  If your buyer sells it a year later for the ""same"" $400, it's not breaking even, it's losing 3% or more.  You could posit a theoretical stock that always went up but still was always a loss in terms of real value, because it didn't match the inflation rate.<p>Let's consider the case of a stock that keeps falling.  It's a money-loser for one person after another, and instead of profit-sharing they are distributing loss between themselves, balancing out the profit that has already been taken out.  If the freefall rate is too fast for the market reaction time, then someone ends up selling too low, and their loss pays for whoever buys it and sells it at the more stable price.<p>The issue that people like to muddle is the ""pie fallacy"" straw man.

If everyone has their money in ""safe"" investments, there is no demand for your stock.  So you need to convince people to put their money in <i>riskier</i> investments instead.  And it's risky because most people <i>lose</i> money.<p>In fact, the whole ecosystem is built on Venture Capital, and most of the ventures fail.  As everyone knows, the VCs get paid a fee even if the fund doesn't have a return.<p>And if it does have a return, there are still all the losses incurred by everyone who put their lives into their startups which ended up not working out, which is something like 9 out of 10 startups.  Plus the investors' money which was lost, only made up for by someone else.<p>And then there is all the wealth NOT created because you can't hire the talent, since it is in a busy-loop at some giant company doing something less useful, like making Skinner boxes, waiting for stocks to vest.

The only reasons I have been able to do anything are Real World Haskell, Learn You A Haskell, and Stack Overflow.<p>I'm not going to say Haskell is useless, or has no libraries, etc.  Those aren't true. It's also not a bad language because it's weirder than my Blub (Common Lisp). It's a really sweet language, and I think in the hands of an expert, Haskell can <i>dance</i>.<p>But, I'm going to say Haskell is nearly impossible for an experienced procedural programmer to pick up and go with on the fly. There are a few reasons for my opinion:<p>* Special operators out the wazzoo. >>= ` ++ :: etc. The wrong 'dialect' of Haskell leads you to believe it's Perl and APL's love child. It's just not clear what something does until you find a reference book. Google doesn't help here - I don't even know the verbal names for some of them. :)<p>* Monads & in particular, the IO Monad. The number of tutorials and explanations (and the number of new ones) suggest that this is not the most obvious concept in the land. It seems to be very simple if you know what you're doing (and what operators to use), though.<p>* The REPL is not identical to the compiler. This means that you can't <i>trust</i> the REPL. Coming from Python and Lisp, that is a pain.<p>* Type messages that are quite unclear, and probably require referring to the Haskell98 report to fully understand.<p><i>Regardless</i>, the above are surmountable problems and reasonable when moving to a new paradigm (very frustrating, though).<p>However, there are two key issues that are close to deal-breakers, with a third more minor one.<p>* Time to put a small program together. Easily 3x-10x my time working on Ocaml, a language which I am less experienced in (in both languages, I am amazingly inexperienced).<p>* Building the compiler on PPC (business reasons why I would need to do this).  Ocaml builds with the traditional ./configure && make. Very straightforward. GHC requires a cross compile with some funky source tweaks, or <i>possibly</i> a binary package (but the bin package dependency tree required replacing libc++, at which point I stopped).  This is a dealbreaker unless I can straightforwardly guarantee my boss a good ROI with Haskell vs. (OCaml or other statically typed language).<p>* Human costs for my code. It's not professional to have a codebase only I can use in a team. Yes, the team could learn Haskell, but would it be a good ROI? If OCaml gets us there faster...<p>So Haskell is probably not going to work for me at work. :-(  We'll see though.",1318897243

Though, no one knows if apple will stay ""cool"" and their products will still sell 4,000,000 units (iphone 4S) in a weekend. Many people thought nothing would happen to Sony when they were hot and innovative. Same thing with Microsoft.<p>It is slightly different because Apple has more vertical integration and horizontal integration as well, so people buy into the Apple ecosystem. For example, I have a mac and an Android phone, but I like the way the iPhone syncs seamlessly with my mac, so I might get an iPhone when my contract is up.<p>Ultimately, sales/revenues and profits GROWTH determine the stock price. At their current P/E it is hard to say they are overvalued. A multiple of 16.63 (close on 10/17) is very low for a high growth tech company. In fact, McDonald's, which is considered a value stock, has a higher multiple (almost 18). And as a more relevant example, Amazon's is over 100. Apple clearly is not overvalued at this point (in my opinion at least).<p>Random thoughts: Apple has roughly 1 billion shares outstanding and Microsoft has 8 billion.

Society has taken a huge right-ward tilt, conservatives have gotten everything they wanted.</i><p>Sigh. We just got the biggest <i>increase</i> in entitlement programs in more than two generations. The government <i>claims</i> it's cutting spending, but actually it won't be any smaller, they've only decelerate slightly. In the meantime, the regulatory state is thriving. I challenge you to name an industry that one could safely enter without needing to learn myriad details of what the government demands of businesses in that industry. This is <i>not</i> an age of deregulation, and GWB was no friend of small government nor of the free market.<p><i>NOT A SINGLE BANKER WAS FIRED OR PROSECUTED, ... The government is in their back pocket, they do as they want.</i><p>The banking meltdown was due to the banking industry taking some unconscionable risks, but it was also due to the regulators themselves pushing the banking industry to take risks. Industry is also in the back pocket of the government, as business leaders vie for the advantages that government bequeaths. Yet how many politicians and bureaucrats have been held accountable for the debacle?<p><i>We are living in your vision of the world.</i><p>You have no idea how wrong you are. You seem to be drawing a mental picture of the political world that follows the narrative told by the main stream media, but that's so gross an oversimplification as to be useless. The political spectrum is not one of Liberals versus Conservatives. So when you assume that, because I'm arguing against your Liberal stance, I must be a Conservative, is just plain wrong.<p>There are many ways to look at the political world. Taking the simplistic view is not going to help you solve any problems, any more than you'll be able to debug your software if you don't understand how the machine, your compiler, the network protocols, etc., work.<p>First, you should understand that the vast majority of the people in politics and in the business world are not evil. They are just people like you and I, responding to the problems and incentives in front of them, trying to make a life for themselves and their families. The size and complexity of the system makes it less clear where the line between right and wrong is, and easy to fudge for any particular action. While the structure of the system today makes it all too compelling to make the wrong choice.<p>Your insistence that so many of your neighbors are evil -- when they know that they're not, and just doing their best -- is going to make anyone you disagree with defensive. That'll prevent you from changing any minds, and instead just widen the political chasm that we suffer from today. I beg you, take a step back from the incrimination, and try to understand what's going on as the collective work of many individuals, each responding to situations put in front of them.",1318896551

After the ipad came out tablets changed and the cries of everyone at first was ""it is just a big ipod touch"" and things of that nature.

Launches Aver Technology - Democratizes Health Care Data",,"In the universe of new ideas its rare to find something that is actually new, and that really works. Introducing Aver, a new software as a service technology launched by Aver Informatics that revolutionizes the way healthcare organizations manage their business. Aver is an innovative and intuitive data exploration tool that allows users of any skill level to extract, analyze, compare and share data from different operational systems throughout an organization, resulting in millions of dollars of revenue for large healthcare enterprises. Extolled as grassroots analytics, health care savings are captured by unlocking the untapped potential of subject matter experts working within the healthcare institutions that are inhibited by legacy tools. Aver breaks down the barrier between information technology and healthcare expertise. Cross functional experts with knowledge of the issues can rapidly diagram in a collaborative environment, modeling data, testing, and deploying solutions that resolve interdisciplinary challenges. Powerful insights expose transformative relationships in the data preventing incorrect claims payments, improving clinical outcomes, and increasing operational efficiencies.<p>Aver was developed to assist entities throughout the healthcare industry by using data to explore and model solutions to problems and constraints experienced by payers and providers, said Kurt Brenkus, Aver President and CEO. We have an urgent need to improve the way our healthcare system operates when we consider the nearly $150 billion lost every year due to incorrect and improper claims payments. With Aver, we can create immediate and sustainable change within the healthcare system and make a significant contribution toward healthcare reform.<p>Avers unique features allow users at every level of an organization to access and interact with data without having to rely on critical IT resources which are often stretched thin. This ability provides subject matter experts with the information they need to quickly identify problem areas and develop cost-saving solutions. Aver also\nallows payers and providers to take a partnership approach by collaborating with real- time information to enhance care management, track episodes and improve outcomes for individuals and aggregated groups.<p>Aver recently completed its first pilot with Group Health Cooperative of South Central Wisconsin (GHC-SCW), a 66,500 member plan. During the 3-month test period a validation of the tool against existing claim payment reports and a further review of other opportunities for improvement were identified. With the review process, cost- savings were identified through streamlining of operational efficiencies. Bob Mielke Insurance Operations Manager reflected on the pilot, I was impressed with the staff I worked with and their understanding of the health care insurance business. They were able to consume the data we provided quickly and GHC-SCW was able to validate the data within a short time.<p>Aver Informatics, Inc. was formed in 2010. As of June 30th, 2011, Aver has secured over $1.3 million in funding from prominent Wisconsin investors including Shamrock Partners, Wisconsin Investment Partners and Silicon Pastures, as well as individual angel investors from around the country.<p>###<p>Aver Informatics Inc., based in De Pere, Wisconsin, builds easy-to-use data management tools designed to improve operational efficiencies throughout the healthcare industry, resulting in increased revenue for payers and providers, and improved quality outcomes for patients.

The iPhone has built in image stabilization (which I think depends on the lens for the Canon) and it does it in a really great way.  Rather than cropping the image like the old digital IS methods, it adjusts what part of the sensor it takes the 2megapixel video image from, based on the built in gyroscope and accelerometer.<p>The 8MP sensor in the iPhone 4S apparently delivers the full 8MP image at 30 frames a second, letting the the CPU or GPU convert it to an HD frame.<p>In traditional cameras, they have to build into the sensor the ability to take a subset of the sensor data, because they cannot read off the full sensor that fast.

The relative cost of this is highly variable and business-dependent, but at best its mildly inconvenient and at worst can be crippling. Its definitely something that needs to be accounted for. That said, I&#x27;ve also been lead on apps that used the same pieces of server infrastructure that had far better uptime when I handle ops myself instead of delegating that to another provider.

My guess is no. Because it&#x27;s not like your proposing an optimum economy size for maximum worker friendliness. You&#x27;re just opposing a kind of change from the status quo.<p>I agree that too much industry consolidation is a problem for workers. But I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a problem of trade. That&#x27;s a problem that comes whenever you a) increase disparity in power between workers and employers and b) decrease opportunity to switch to a different employer. If we had a situation where no countries traded but each country allowed monopolies to form, workers would be screwed. If, on the other hand, we have free trade but vigorous enforcement of anti-trust and merger review, I think workers can do pretty well.<p>I also agree that <i>increasing</i> trade can shift what industries do well in particular locales, which is good for some workers but bad for others. The obvious solution there is not to protect the inefficient jobs, but to tax the people doing better (some workers, all consumers) and pay for excellent retraining, and to pension off the workers who can&#x27;t be retrained, and/or fund nonprofits to employ them doing something societally valuable but not profitable.<p>As an example, look at the American auto industry. As a Michigander, I know how devastating the rise of import cars was. But honestly, that industry needed some devastation. They produced low-quality, low-reliability products and then milked consumers on repairs and flim-flam sales techniques. They did provide jobs, but often pretty terrible ones. And none of this was necessary; it&#x27;s just that consolidation (which, remember, happened without trade) made a cozy oligopoly, leaving management to focus on exploitation. 40 years later they are still struggling to break this pattern, but at least now Americans can buy decent cars at reasonable prices.<p>If you want to hear the costs of your protectionist approach, listen to this TAL episode: <a href=""http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/403/NUMMI"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/403/N...</a><p>Listen to the pain in the GM workers&#x27; voices.

I&#x27;ve had extremely weird conversations with new managers, they really can&#x27;t evaluate anything outside of their old small picture beyond did you show up and are you in a good mood?  For a few months an inexperienced noob sadly has nothing intelligent to say beyond &quot;how bout that extra long lunch last thursday?&quot;.  People pick up on the weirdness of adding trivia to the discussion but fail to notice the subtraction of all meat from the conversation, its all &quot;he&#x27;s so picky about calling in sick&quot; not the equally true &quot;holy cow I screwed up process 34B last week and expected to get called on the carpet about it, but all this guy talks about is sick days&quot;.  As a corollary, if you&#x27;re going to try something new that may explode, do it with a new boss, because if it explodes all he&#x27;s going to understand is your timeclock hours and if you smile a lot, so you&#x27;re off the hook.<p>Sometimes its a negative result of excessive stress or unrealistic goals.  Bosses boss says do this two week in one week, boss says OK, inevitable fail, called on carpet, well dev A was sick with flu and dev B was five minutes late to work (LOL as if that matters).  Next week the boom falls on sick days and being five minutes late.  Sometimes bosses boss knows this is a stupid tactic and hopes the noob boss has a learning experience.  I had a bosses boss who actually did that to me.  I thought he was a complete ass for doing it, but punishing my guys was an effective way of stopping me from making dumb excuses in the future, so I haven&#x27;t done that in 20+ years, at least not knowingly.<p>On a few rare occasions I&#x27;ve seen it as very poor communications.  &quot;Must be done before Tuesday&quot; so nobody works on it over the weekend, when inexperienced boss really meant &quot;Must be done ASAP like right now even if it is 2am on Saturday&quot;.  Noob bosses need to learn to communicate.  If you need all direct reports to show up for the staff meeting once a month with your boss on Wednesdays don&#x27;t talk down to the employees and tell them to all show up at 8am every morning when they only really have to on rare occasion.<p>I&#x27;ve also seen incompetent middle managers enforce it on lower level managers to avoid certain discussions, as a punishment, essentially.  I want someone else to take your job, so your direct reports are going to be screwed over until you fail and you are replaced.  Or to appear more active and in touch, &quot;I&#x27;m not just a pencil pushing idiot I have a really great plan to track who&#x27;s late from lunch because I care because my eval says I need to care more, therefore you will support my dumb idea&quot;.

10226910,comment,10225396,10226269,0,0,koralatov,,,"There are two points that you&#x27;ve conflated and dismissed glibly with one statement:  the slightly longer (+5%?  +10%) lifespans of the rich today, and the hypothetical doubling+ of lifespans being directly discussed here.  They&#x27;re totally different and can&#x27;t be treated as one and the same.  (Owning a car in 1910 and having a 200 year lifespan is a comparison so disingenuous that I&#x27;m not going to spend any more effort discussing it.)<p>The slight increase that wealth currently brings is unfortunate for those who don&#x27;t benefit from it, but doesn&#x27;t seem to draw widespread contempt or criticism.  It does, and should, act as a spur to remove or mitigate the factors in poorer peoples&#x27; lives that stop them from living to the same age.<p>The &#x27;contempt&#x27; in the parent --- pretty mild, and probably not contemptuous enough to accurately be called &#x27;contempt&#x27; ---  stems from the fact that the rich living much longer than everyone else would be yet another example of widening inequality in society.  If we&#x27;re talking some kind of treatment or technology that doubles lifespan, why shouldn&#x27;t people be pissed off about not being able to access that?  That&#x27;s not a slight improvement like we&#x27;re talking about above:  that would effectively be an <i>entire second life</i>.  I know for a fact that I&#x27;d be angry as hell knowing my fiancée would die at half the age of a rich person simply because we don&#x27;t have the money to buy whatever it takes to make her live to 200+.<p>The very idea of some people having that whilst others radically and perhaps fatally undermines current human society, which is implicitly built on the idea that everyone only has one life.<p>It seems implicit in your comment that you think that this kind of imbalance is somehow fair or just or natural.  Why shouldn&#x27;t the aim always be to let <i>everyone</i> benefit from advances rather than just those who can afford it?  You can argue that technological progress will allow life-extension to trickle-down, but that doesn&#x27;t happened evenly or reliably, and seems a bad assumption upon which to base society&#x27;s progress.",1442414275

One of the deeper insights we can learn in general is that at scale no matter how cool the concurrency mechanisms, how fast, and new, if they don&#x27;t go hand in hand with fault isolation then it will just be a very fast system until it starts crashing and its throughput drops to 0. Of course you can do fault isolation with separate servers and OS processes (containers,VMs...) but in this case they do it at a finer grained level.",1442413810

10226795,comment,10225203,10226331,0,0,MrJagil,,,"There&#x27;s a couple of reasons:<p>1. A lot artists don&#x27;t incorporate cassette into the workflow much. Usually people do what they do with a DAW or go to a studio to record. Cassette is <i>mostly</i> used as medium (like CD, vinyl etc). But yes, I do have friends who record directly on cassette. This will sound very rough though (depending on setup), too much even for some lo-fi aficionados.<p>2. Hipster points. Tapes are very &quot;in&quot; right now. Don&#x27;t disregard this point. Just like networking is sometimes seen as a sacrifice of your &quot;humanity&quot;, so is hipsterism. This is not so. Like it or not, sometimes it&#x27;s important to go with the flow and play the field.<p>3. Easy/cheap to make. You do have to record in real-time which sucks when duplicating tapes, but other than that it&#x27;s way easier to do a few tapes than to go vinyl.<p>4. People like supporting artists. This can be hard. Many shows are free, everyone downloads, so tapes, even if they can&#x27;t be played at home, are a way to show your appreciation.<p>5. Sound. The sound is to me the most important part. Cassette can sound just as good as vinyl with the proper transfer, and introduces some great artifacts like a smoother high-end and a bit of saturation.<p>6. Professionalism. If you&#x27;ve spent 20-50 hours to create artwork, order tapes, duplicate them (or get someone else to do it) etc etc you show that you&#x27;re serious about shit. It&#x27;s a way to create your brand (of course this goes for vinyl etc as well).<p>7. I&#x27;d just like to copy Coldpie&#x27;s point in regards to vinyl further down in this thread. Go upvote him: 
&quot;...for some there&#x27;s more to listening to music than just listening to music. Going to the shelf and looking over the albums, remembering when you bought each album, who you&#x27;ve played them for, things that were happening while you listened to them. Looking at the cover art or the silly liner art or notes[1]. Noticing markings (or smells...) from previous owners and wondering about them, what they were doing when they bought or listened to the album. Physically placing the album on the turntable and aligning the needle. Listening to the lead-in scratches as you adjust the volume before the music kicks in. Sometimes you get silly lead-out loops[2].
It&#x27;s just a fun, physical way to listen to music.&quot;",1442413378

Still, I was a teenager with a $100 guitar, some old boom boxes, and a lot of time.<p>Still, I can&#x27;t imagine cassette is easier or cheaper to record and distribute compared to digital or even CD-R today.  I&#x27;m guessing it has as much to do with &quot;novelty&quot; (which is funny to say about deliberate anachronism) as ease/cost of distribution.<p>That said, if people dig it, then more power to them.  I like picking up vinyl records at Goodwill because they&#x27;re 4 for a dollar and sometimes I find something that ends up being pretty interesting.  I also buy vinyl new releases sometimes because there&#x27;s something more psychologically pleasing about getting a &quot;thing&quot; for your money instead of a file that could just as easily be duplicated infinitely.  I really like how vinyl often comes with a digital download code so I still get a 256-320k/sec mp3 copy for portability and convenience but I also get the big cover art and something tangible.  Album art really is something I miss about physical media and vinyl 33&#x27;s are large enough to offer great, big cover art.",1442413352

Looking at the cover art or the silly liner art or notes[1].

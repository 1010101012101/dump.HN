And the difference between $10m and $100m is smaller yet! If you can pay yourself $3m a year, acquisition is pretty irrelevant - you're rich anyway.",1216972395

256385,comment,256378,256378,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I went looking for a phone to replace my current one (I've been rollin' with the deuce, err...Sidekick II...for about five years now) last week.  The space is just abysmal.<p>I expected to find a half dozen phones with similarly priced plans that had a decent browser.  But it turns out, the carriers won't sell me a plan as cheap as my current one, and that's the <i>main</i> reason I want to move to something else.  I use the damned thing so little, it's just stupid for me to keep paying $65/month for the privilege.  I talk about 45 minutes per month, on average, with occasional peaks up to 100 minutes or so, if my folks are feeling chatty.  I browse the web about 30 minutes per month, maybe as much as 100 minutes when I'm traveling.  I don't use email (because email sucks on the Sidekick, though I do use our own webmail client which has a pretty good mobile interface), and I never use SMS.<p>To get pretty much anything with the same sized screen or larger, and a data plan (of any kind--even one that bills by the minute), it'll cost me more per month than I'm already paying.<p>Why won't they sell me a cheap voice plan (100 minutes would do me just fine) and a reasonable data plan?  I guess because that'd be less money for them.  But, it's ridiculous...they've priced me out of the smart phone market entirely.  I don't need the damned thing, but it'd be convenient to have when I want GPS or something...but it's definitely not $80/month worth of convenience to me.  So, instead of a smart phone provider getting $40/month from me, one of the pay-as-you-go dumb phone providers will be getting $20 every three months.  I'll probably be happier with it anyway.  I won't feel the urge to read reddit or HN while I'm waiting for my tea or lunch, and instead might talk to someone or something.",1216971407

You can plot it out so that it's projected there will be no Japanese left by the end of the next? century, but a gentle ""will the last person please turn out the lights"" scenario is extremely unlikely in such a rough neighborhood, where so many of the neighbors have serious grudges from 20th century Imperial Japan (at the time of the atomic bombings, the monthly death toll of the conquered people was in the low six figures; they killed 250K Chinese just trying to find <i>one</i> Doolittle crew, etc. etc. etc. etc.).<p>All that money invested in the Postal Savings System is, as far as I know, <i>gone</i>.  As the article noted, it's invested in ""safe"" government bonds, i.e. the money has been long spent and with the current and rising worthy of a 3rd World country debt to GDP ratio it's vanishingly unlikely it'll ever be repaid.  Especially if each succeeding decade continues to be ""lost"".<p>However, all that said, the Japanese have a modern history of substantial and successful (at least at some levels) remaking of their society, e.g. Sengoku (civil war) -> Bakufu (military government AKA shogunate) -> Meji Restoration sliding into Imperial Japan -> post-WWII fantastic recovery.<p>Although perhaps this success is mostly to be judged from the viewpoint of the ruling class, which has been been all too often fantastically inept.  Japan hasn't been run for the benefit of the people as far back as I know (e.g. Sengoku), and one might observe that its terminal demographics are a reflection of the people having reached a tipping point (check out some of the comments in the article; I can say that from what I've read descent rice is beyond the budget of many if not most Japanese (they're now into the 2nd generation of thrifty mothers feeding their children bread for breakfast and noodles for lunch)).<p>Maybe they'll recover.  But it won't happen absent something that changes the reward structure so that family creation becomes healthy.",1262548783

For this reason initially we want to target the low end of content on the quality spectrum, charge them to try to distribute their films using our platform online, and go from there. So their goals may not be to get picked up by a big time distributor. Our goal is to simply let them get some sort of return, or exposure, for their film (or web series).<p>One of the directors I'm consulting with had found a distributor, but has decided that looking back he would have self-distributed.

Or to a public-domain one like SQLite. Or a fully proprietary one. It's their software and, since, they have already licensed it as proprietary, their users were already robbed the freedoms GPL'ed MySQL would provide.<p>As it is now, those companies have licenses for specific versions.

Phineas Barnum would be happy to use them as examples.<p>""whether this is fair is up for debate""<p>If handing over copyright is too expensive, companies are always free not to contribute or not to use Asterisk at all.

The only freedom the allegedly ""more open"" licenses give developers is to deny freedoms to their users. For the users (and software freedom is about them), those licenses give nothing.<p>But we are drifting from the original topic.<p>The topic is that MySQL is Oracle-proof and doesn't need saving the same way other GPL'ed products don't need saving.

I tried doing stuff for the internet - I had a BIG discovery problem.<p>Yes, I am starting to meet iPhone app developers who target specific niches. In other words, people are searching for something like their app. Their app is not found via email/blog/twitter PR primarily. And it helps that the <i>title</i> of their app has one or more of those keywords.",1262545589

1028881,comment,1028673,1028792,0,0,d4ft,,,"Hi Daniel-<p>I guess what my argument comes down to is this: if I were an indie director, given the choice,  I would prefer to get my movies seen by more people, and make less money (at least in the beginning), than set a price and make people pay, which will inevitably decrease viewings.  I think the best way to accomplish the former, would be to put it on youtube and promote it. Yes, casual browsers would be lost.  But, with the pay-per-view model, we are not getting too many casual browsers anyway, since they have to pay.  So, perhaps the best way to do such a thing would be to have a youtube for indie movies and just let them be free.<p>Further, I also see problems with the distribution model.  If we store these movies in the cloud, you need internet to watch them.  That kind of sucks.  If you store them locally, they take up a ton of space.  That also sucks.  If we can delete them after we watch and then download them later, that still necessitates an internet connection, and kind of sucks anyway.<p>As a final note, I guess I haven't convinced myself either way, so thanks for playing along.",1262545476

But judicious use of @replies and @mentions (when you don't start your tweet with a @username so everyone can see it) is easily 10x more powerful for business and personal networking than LinkedIn, which I find 10x more powerful than anything else (meatspace meetups excepted, of course).<p>Of course, you can leverage Twitter to make your meatspace life better - where to go at conferences, a ""hey, can we meet up"" in advance of events, where the afterparty's at, etc.<p>If you think of Twitter as a business tool like LinkedIn rather than a personal tool like Facebook, you'll get a lot more out of it immediately.  If you develop a decent following base that's actually paying attention to you, then you can do second-level stuff as ""what is the best [x] for me given [y]"" and get exceptional answers.  But that only works once you've cultivated a good following.",1262545422

I see one great use for twitter, which is what I am using it for right now: Get major influencers to follow you. When you do that, you have a good chance to be republished by one of them, which is great PR.<p>(That's why I bothered writing two articles recently, trying to raise my twitter 'important people' follower count.

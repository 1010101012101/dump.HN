""grades"" don't actually mean anything they're just a social fiction created to justify why some people have greater shares of power/wealth/freedom than others.<p>Asian families, the pragmatic authoritarians they are, are very good at hacking this system of social sorting. The elite colleges know this. Elite colleges are n the business of creating and maintaining high status in the eyes of society. The highest status people are often not the best education-hackers. Therefore, the elite colleges don't sort solely or even primarily on the basis of grades. They want people who are going to rise to powerful, prominent, high status positions and they accurately recognize that hordes of Asian authoritarian parents are just hacking the system for their family's wealth.<p>They use racial profiling because it makes sense given their goals. Anyone who tells you it isn't racism is suffering from some kind of American myth of a post racial world.<p>Caltech is color blind because their goals are different. Caltech is for scientists and so they don't care what race you are. Yale is for leaders and good leaders usually don't get that way by being obedient violinists.",1322971161

3309758,comment,3308271,3308271,5,0,jrockway,,,"Emacs color theming is an epic failure.  There are too many modes that define their own colors, and the colors are not defined in any semantic way: they are simply colors that the author of the mode likes.  That means that if you switch to a color theme like Solarized (or anything), some mode is going to have fucked up and unusable colors.<p>Most of the time, things appear to work because everyone writes their font-lock modes in terms of meaningful colors, like ""font-lock-builtin-face"", but as soon as you venture outside of what font-lock provides, you're fucked if the color theme author doesn't use the modes you do.  And since pretty much everyone uses different modes, color themes simply do not work.  (I usually define my colors in terms of the font-lock faces to make sure that color themes work.  But sometimes you have more information than a normal font-lock mode does, and then you have to manually select a new color.  Hashes and arrays in cperl-mode are a specific example.)<p>I also have some specific complaints about how the mode is written.  Why is the color theme definer burdened with quasiquoting and color classes when a macro could make it possible to sanely extend the color theme without extra work?  Something like:<p><pre><code>   (define-color-theme solarized\n      :base-colors-for light\n          foo ""#abcdef""\n          bar ""#fedcba""\n          baz ""#coffee""\n      :mode-colors-for light\n          background foo\n          font-lock-builtin-face bar\n          ...) \n</code></pre>\nAs it stands, there is too much boilerplate and I would never be motivated enough to type everything needed to get the modes I use to work.<p>Also, while I'm whining, why do people name their own fucked-up Emacs config things like ""Emacs Prelude"" instead of ""my .emacs""?  I agree that many of Emacs' defaults are stupid, but the solution is education, not a random .emacs that invalidates the Emacs documentation.  When you change all the defaults, you'd better provide a new user manual, or people are just going to be confused.<p>Sorry if this sounds harsh, but I got my wisdom teeth out yesterday and the painkillers are not doing much for me. :)",1322969206

If there were more people, it could be harder to find who these great people are.

One of the organizations that I'm familiar with is retaining all email sent or received since 1992, due to a series of long-standing lawsuits. If you're retaining email for one litigation, it can and will be used in a subsequent litigation if you have it.<p>But on the other hand, many, if not most email communications are ephemeral in nature. In many large companies and government especially, IM was seen as a toy that kids played with, and was banished from corporate networks. At the same time, they provide NO convenient tools for sharing data and NO ability to search through the limited data storage options available.<p>The result? Employees use email to send IM-like messages, and the mailbox becomes a defacto, uncontrolled, electronic file cabinet.<p>So if you let people take care of ephemeral communications with IM/voice/video, (especially voice/video) you probably improve communications and limit liability. And if you use sharepoint or a similar tool to share stuff, you can setup retention policies, etc to manage those risks.",1322967950

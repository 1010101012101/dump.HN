1954719,comment,1954210,1954210,0,0,kenjackson,,,"On average it matters.  But for ""you"" it doesn't.<p>My problem with college is that there aren't good metrics to judge how good a college is.  The only data we really have is how good are the incoming students.  If you moved the student body at Harvard to Kansas State and vice-versa (allowing for differences in population), but kept the relative reputations (so the students at KState were still considered the brightest, although now the faculty was different), what would be the result?  Nothing?  Severly undereducated students from KState and failing students from Harvard?  Who knows?<p>Today people use college attended as a proxy for how smart you were at age 17.  Which is unfortunate, because I think I tend to see the biggest intellectual growth from people between 21 to 30 (which is largely after grad school admissions).",1291136387

Because array length is immutable the JVM must wait until execution to create an array of the proper size.<p>With the overloaded static createArray() methods used in ArrayUtils the size of the array can be determined and memory allocated (based on the number of parameters at the callsite and hence which variation of the method should be called) at the JRE's convenience/when optimal.<p>All of this is probably micro-optimization to the who-really-cares level, and might even be irrelevant due to javac/JIT magic, just wanted to show that the existence of the new Object[] syntax doesn't preclude there being performance gains from using something like ArrayUtil.createArray().",1291136363

If this alternate DNS system relies on the .p2p TLD, ISP's will have an easy way to filter this traffic.  Beyond simple blacklist blocking, similar to what Comcast is doing to Level 3, it would make more sense for ISP's to simply charge extra (a lot extra) to access the .p2p side of the Internet.<p>A similar conversation was had years ago around the .xxx TLD discussion.  In the end, the Internet needs to be open and priced at a level where everyone can access the information contained within it.  If the US, China, etc start to impose drastic, unresonable restrictions then we will have no other choice except to create alternate systems.

Since phone carriers subsidize the manufacturers, we've actually seen margins remain relatively high.<p>We certainly haven't seen a race to the bottom.  To be clearer, the subsidy model changes the equation.  The reason for getting you on a new phone is to get you to reup a $2000 contract.  If you have a phone that drives this (iPhone) then the cost of the phone is worth it to the carriers.  If the phone doesn't do that (Kin) then it doesn't matter if the phone is free.<p>Until the US market sells unlocked phones directly to consumers (as the dominant way to distribute phones to consumers) there will not be a race to the bottom.<p>UPDATE: And one other thing.  Since the carriers largely lock down their networks, you can't just buy a generic smartphone from cheapphones.com and have it work (at least not on the 3G/4G networks).  So we also have the added factor of very limited shelfspace.  Whereas in the PC market, there are tons of PC makers and DIY.<p>Realistically, the carriers probably won't have more than 10-15 smartphones available at any one time to purchase (testing costs money), and have good relationship with a handful of phone manufacturers -- all of which work to avoid a race to the bottom.",1291134832

Npm is a rubygem-like manager but I have been frustrated over the years with gems because it's a central repository that can go really wrong if you mess with it. I had problems on when I tried Ruby1.9 and when I moved to Rails 3 because everything is central and if a config changes, it can break it all. Sometimes, I feel stuck in rubygems-hell like I was stuck in DLL-hell back in the days.<p>I would want node.js to avoid central repositories and I would prefer projects be stand-alone : you clone it and you run it in its own environment. That means having the right node version in a ""bin"" directory but also having modules installed in its subdirectories.<p>Example, if you have three projects using Express, you'll have 3 copies of Express, one in each of the subdirs of the projects.<p>Would you use that kind of package manager?",1291134463

Frustratingly, there is no official hub where every designer goes, so you have to look in a lot of places. Elance has some talented people, but it doesn't have all the people you should be looking for.<p>When you're looking for a designer, the rule is you try to find somebody who makes things you like looking at first. That's the most important part. Looking through their portfolio, then, you're trying to see the extent of their prowess. Do they rely on the same design tricks with every single layout they make (gradients, pretty buttons, slidy things), or are they making sure each web site does what it's supposed to do? Have they got any subtlety of understanding what a web site's needs are, or are they designing a bunch of things that look the same no matter what they're meant to be?<p>Then you talk to them. See if they ""get"" what you're talking about. Don't plan your questions in advance — conversations work better than interviews. Do they intuit your needs? If you have to clarify something that at first isn't clear, do they catch on to where you're going? You want somebody who's going to make the web site you want to make.<p>As for price: Offer what you can afford, and see if they'll take it. With designers, you never know. My team has taken $200 contracts because the work was simple enough and we liked the team offering. We've done freelance work because we liked the cause or liked the challenge and had an opening in our schedule.<p>The best way to find designers is to stick to people who've made work you like, or people you know, or people who've said interesting things, and contact them directly. Sort of like how directors stick to their favorite actors and cinematographers or, if they don't have any, they ask their friends to help out. Keep it personal. Personal does better work for you.<p>(If you're not speaking hypothetically, by the way, feel free to write me — we're open again for business starting Thursday. [/selfpromotion])",1291134428

But largely, I was building it for myself.<p>I used to think, based on the motivation and lack of drive for contract work, that I wasn't really cut out to be self-employed. But I realize now that I'm not cut out as a freelance web designer/developer. I want to develop apps that I come up with or that I am passionate about.<p>Has anyone else had this realization moment?",1291133626

I do think awareness to the shifting role of the designer is necessary at this point.</i><p>But I still don't agree with this. If anything, I think we need more designers to step up and say ""The idea of a 'designer' is dead. Stop pretending like it's possible to be a professional in this day and age; we're all amateurs of differing degrees. There's more to learn than you'll ever be able to learn, so all that matters is that you learn the things you care about learning. Stop wasting time defining things, separating them into canons and non-canons, pretending like success necessarily defines designers or adds an extra meaning to their work.""<p>I'm primarily studying advertising right now — though it's certainly not my only or even primary interest — and one thing that attracts me to the study is that the top advertisers on the planet have been saying this for a decade. Agencies like Wieden+Kennedy and the Barbarian Group turn out some work that's so beyond the kin of what we recognize as advertising that it forces you to acknowledge that the old definitions have been thrown out the window, regardless of whether some people insist they're still there.<p>Design hasn't gotten there yet: It's a more conservative field than advertising. (I mean, so is everything. That's the whole idea of being in advertising.) Even the people I just named tend to be more conservative with their designs than the half-generation following them is going to be. Of all the ones I named I think only Inman and the Twitter team are really doing something new, and even they aren't off-the-walls crazy. Not that there's anything bad with that.<p>But certainly one of the reasons I'm not primarily a designer is that it's one of the few artistic fields whose education focuses on old tried-and-true standards rather than on the crazy things that happened last week or yesterday or earlier today. A whole lot of design feels appallingly stagnant.<p>(I'd love to talk this with you more in-depth, by the way — would you mind if I shot you an email?)",1291133201

Just about every CDN out there pays to peer with Comcast to deliver bits faster and cheaper to Comcast eyeballs.<p>Level(3) is an ISP.  Because they carry traffic Comcast customers want they have been able to peer at no-cost to Comcast historically.  Now Level(3) is building and selling a large CDN.  Level(3) is taking advantage of these existing peering circuits to be able to offer lower-cost CDN than their competitors because they don't have to pay Comcast to exchange traffic.  As a consequence, their CDN has grown very large.  They now dump far more traffic onto Comcast's network than Comcast sends them.  Comcast says their peering policy is based on equal traffic ratios.  Therefore, unless Level(3) can balance their peering circuits, they will be forced to pay.<p>This has little to do with Net Neutrality and has been happening between various ISPs over the last 10-20 years.<p>In IPv6 it's even worse.

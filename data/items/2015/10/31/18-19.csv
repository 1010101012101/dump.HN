10483694,comment,10480390,10482666,0,0,ced,,,"Thank you for the detailed explanation, I get the point about liquidity and traditional market makers, that makes sense.<p>But isn&#x27;t the point about HFT (at least, the part that is described in the comic) being &quot;insider information&quot; reasonable? Some people are willing to sell now for a low price, and some people are willing to wait longer for a better price, but I don&#x27;t think anyone is unwilling to wait 1 millisecond for a significantly better price, no? Does liquidity on the millisecond scale make sense?<p>> He&#x27;s not willing to wander around hoping to find a better price in another cave. That&#x27;s a service that the 2nd caveman is performing for him.<p>I can see that, and in some contexts it&#x27;s a very valuable service.<p>But suppose I&#x27;m caveman 1. I know that CaveBob is a middleman. Everytime he comes to see me, it&#x27;s because he knows something I don&#x27;t, and I end up regretting my trade with him because a few hours later, I invariably realize that I could have made a much better trade. Then I&#x27;ll stop trading with CaveBob, of course, and I&#x27;ll naturally bump into those needing my meat a few hours later.<p>In a stock exchange, I can&#x27;t stop trading with CaveBob&#x27;s, as far as I know. If a stock market without market makers and HFT rises by 5% every year, then by participating, I can hope to make as much if I&#x27;m average at trading. In a market with HFT, they will be taking part of the 5% with very low risk (through technological advantage), so it&#x27;s not clear what&#x27;s left, and the decision to participate is not so clear.",1446317972

Just like it&#x27;s the defending attorney&#x27;s job to get people acquitted, regardless of guilt or innocence. It is the court&#x27;s role to convict guilty people and acquit innocent people, which in theory happens when you allow a prosecutor who wants to convict and a defending attorney who wants to acquit to argue in front of an impartial judge and jury.<p>In theory. It&#x27;s a wacky system when you think about it and there&#x27;s plenty of places it can fall down. But as built, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the prosecutor&#x27;s job to decide innocence or guilt.<p>They do need to follow the rules, though.

10483681,comment,10483181,10483181,0,0,keehun,,,"I&#x27;ve always wondered how autonomous cars would handle the first and last quarter mile of the journey. I&#x27;m talking specifically like portions of the trip like the driveway, getting out of the parking ramp, or navigating small alleyways where the car could be parked (where GPS could be weak in the city). Things like even knowing which entrance to go to. Will fully autonomous will ever be able to take us from A to B 100%? Will humans always take over the last tiny bit where the maps aren&#x27;t detailed and to park? Humans love to drive around the lot to park at exactly the &quot;perfect&quot; spot. Cars can parallel park now, but how will cars decide where to park exactly? Will we ever be able to have the car take us through the drive-thru?<p>I personally think autopilot-like auto-cruise just on the highway and more established local roads would be good enough. The convenience afforded by having the robot take us from A to B parked to parked may not be worth the insane price it must have on its tag to get there.",1446317773

And he&#x27;s right, there&#x27;s always a minimum price below which there is no profit, so whoever posts that price first wins.  Orders compete on time and price because that what is fair.

Your job will include keeping our internal services running, improving our monitoring and incident response, running and automating service migrations and scaling, and feeding everything you learn on the front lines back into the development of our platform.<p>We&#x27;re a small team building a platform and a suite of compliance tools for digital health. Our platform is built around Docker on AWS. Our customers push source code and a Dockerfile to a git repo and our platform takes it from there: building, deploying, and running their image.<p>If you&#x27;re an SRE who&#x27;s looking to work on a smaller, ops-focused development team with a lot more impact and ownership, this is the job for you. If you&#x27;re not an SRE, you may also be a good fit for this position if you&#x27;ve enjoyed ops or sysadmin work in the past but want to write more automation code with modern tools like Chef and Docker on AWS. You&#x27;re probably also a good fit if you&#x27;re a developer who enjoys doing ops work and want to make the transition to shorter-term, higher-impact automation projects.<p>ABOUT US:<p>Aptible’s mission is to help our customers work safely with the most meaningful, sensitive data in highly regulated industries. To do this, we build devops tools that streamline information security compliance for web and mobile applications. We currently focus primarily in healthcare, on HIPAA compliance.<p>Our philosophy is that good engineering products and practices are the best competitive advantage for teams working in regulated technology. We build tools and provide services that help our customers gain those advantages. We serve all kinds of customers, from small dev teams to large business units of established companies.<p>We are backed by the best investors in tech, including Y Combinator (S14), Rock Health, Maverick and Lux Capital.<p>YOU ARE A GOOD FIT IF:<p>- You have extensive experience with AWS<p>- You are excited to work with Docker<p>- You have a professional background related to designing backend software systems<p>- You communicate well and work effectively with others<p>- You are comfortable with high degrees of freedom and responsibility<p>WHY WORK WITH US?<p>- <i>Engineering First:</i> Aptible is a tech company from the ground up. It’s founded by engineers, the team is predominantly engineers, and our users are all engineers. Your coworkers and customers will be some of the best in the world at what they do.<p>- <i>Independence & Trust:</i> Over time, you will be expected to function independently with minimal process overhead for significant portions of your work. This reinforces a high degree of mutual trust within our team.<p>- <i>Our Business Model:</i> We make money by charging our customers a monthly fee for software and services. This allows us to make decisions for the long term. We aren’t the type of startup where we give away everything for free in hopes that once we collect 100 PB of data we can build an AI to replace your doctor or sell pharma ads.<p>- <i>Our Customers:</i> We help the best companies in digital health solve their hardest engineering and regulatory problems. We involve them in our product development process and have a weekly support rotation in which the whole team participates. It’s a great way to learn firsthand the strongest and weakest points in the product.<p>- <i>Introspection:</i> Most of us have worked at a half-dozen companies or more. We’ve lived through best and worst practices in how to run teams. We value regular reflection on process (i.e., retrospectives) with constant small course corrections instead of bulk overhauls when things get really bad. We strive to make expectations clear and give regular, actionable feedback.<p>- <i>Professional Development:</i> In building our deployment platform, you’ll be solving new, hard problems at the bleeding edge of container coordination. If you believe that containers are the new paradigm, your work at Aptible will prepare you tremendously for the future. By helping our customers solve issues with their own open-source-based applications, you’ll quickly become an expert in many open-source frameworks and libraries.<p>- <i>OSS:</i> We believe in active participation in the open-source community on which we’re built. The majority of our GitHub repos are public. You will have the opportunity to create, maintain, and contribute to some of the most interesting projects in open-source.<p>- <i>Flexibility:</i> We are based in Brooklyn but our team is distributed across the country. As a senior engineer, you’ll have the freedom to work on your own schedule, from wherever you like. You’re always more than welcome at headquarters, and we will fly you in periodically for all-hands weeks.<p>- <i>Upside:</i> As an early employee, you’ll receive both competitive salary and meaningful equity in a company that’s growing fast. We think startups should give employees more stock, be more transparent about what percentage of the company that stock represents, and discuss what happens to that stock in various outcomes.<p>OTHER BENEFITS<p>- Full medical, dental and vision coverage — 100% of premiums for employees, 80% for dependent medical premiums, and 100% for dependent dental and vision premiums.<p>- Mandatory minimum vacation each year. Too often at startups, “unlimited vacation” means “no vacation.” We will force you to take time off. Our CEO will suspend your email and GitHub access if you don’t do it.<p>- Whatever computing setup you want.<p>Apply at <a href=""https://jobs.lever.co/aptible/cdc31a4d-e488-439d-96ff-898386bcdbdb/apply?lever-source=HackerNews"" rel=""nofollow"">https://jobs.lever.co/aptible/cdc31a4d-e488-439d-96ff-898386...</a>",1446316369

My father spent a year in the highlands in 1960, in a missionary outpost in a part of the highlands tha only had contact with the outside world about 5 years earlier. He fell in love with the place and the people; I then visited the same a village a couple of years ago, and had what will probably be the trip of a lifetime, with incredible friendly, welcoming and warm people.<p>The cities however are very edgy, dangerous and of no charm whatsoever.<p>This article of course is talking about a very ugly and horrific side of the culture, albeit one that flares up once in a while rather than being ever present.<p>As it discusses, in the highlands the people didn&#x27;t even know the rest of the world existed until the 20th century. They hardly ever went to the next village. It was extraordinarily isolated. It&#x27;s also an incredible story, I strongly recommend the (out of print) book First Contact that describes how both the explorers and locals reacted to this incredible moment - all expertly documented, and recent enough that the authors could interview people who remembered it first hand.<p>The true highlands are not the towns this article discusses. Mount Hagan is a large bustling town with a main airport. It no doubt has much more occurrences of this ugliness, with communities thrown together more and the chaos of large town living.<p>The villages in the highlands, where I visited, don&#x27;t have this kind of vibe, though I&#x27;m sure sometimes events like this could occur. They have a sense of community that we in the west have lost. For instance, all the children play together in one big bundling group of fun.

Most people do not litigate even when they have an excellent chance of success, and behavioural correction requires a certain percentage of individuals to bring and succeed in their cases. The percentage who tend to litigate, and whom can be confidentially settled with out of court, are empirically a fraction the aggregate exposure from a class proceeding.<p>Which is all to say, arbitration clauses are not a problem if you do not feel like corporations should have monetary consequence for bad behaviour.  This is certainly good for the people who own the corporations.<p>There is a problem, whether perceived or real, of &quot;lottery ticket litigation&quot; where plaintiff class action lawyers receive a large payout on success.  Certainly one wants to incentivize capable lawyers  to take on hard and speculative projects by dangling good returns, but in the case of class actions I have always thought of it more as a public interest litigation.  There should be an incentive to succeed, but properly employed class proceedings can have a substantial public benefit.

In the process of restricting supply, it&#x27;ll lift coal back to highly profitable as an industry, and it&#x27;ll fund the creation of new mines.<p>Unless the plan is to buy all the land on earth of course, so you can guarantee all those untapped coal deposits never come on-line.

Does anyone doubt that the next time a President or other authority in the US government faces this choice, they will disregard the APA completely and assume they will go along?<p>* There is no punishment for the perpetrators. These people planned and aided the commission of viscious, brutal crimes on a mass scale. They are sociopaths and should be in prison, the same place we put the Nazi&#x27;s, rapists and mass murderers.<p>* There is no concern for the victims. There is absolutely no mention of them, inquiry into the effects on them, attempt to help them, or restitution. It confirms the government&#x27;s effective position that, as &quot;terrorists&quot;, they are sub-human and their rights and welfare can be disregarded.<p>So many people lacked the courage to stand up to the criminal and immoral acts of the US government at the time.

Mach IPC is used primarily for service discovery these days, I think, what with launchd being responsible for being the bootstrap server, which maintains name-port bindings for Mach services to call into. This is a side effect of Mach port namespaces being internal to tasks, and hence not having an intrinsic arbiter. In contrast though, the Hurd decentralizes this activity by just assigning a bootstrap port for the client making the RPC call to rendezvous with the server or library in question. These days, OS X seldom uses Mach IPC directly, but rather via XPC.<p>Mach had a surprising resurgence in interest over NextBSD implementing a ton of compatibility layers and mangling Apple sources in a weird, misguided attempt to make FreeBSD the new OS X.

It wasn&#x27;t that Torvalds was right and Tannebaum was wrong. It was simply that Tannenbaum had reliability and theoretical correctness in mind, while Torvalds was concerned with performance. The less context switching you do, the more performant your computer will be. We can take this to the extreme and look at OSes like TempleOS [2] where EVERYTHING runs in kernel mode. Most people prefer a bit more reliability, and so modern desktop kernels are generally hybrid kernels (with the notable exception of Linux which is, of course monolithic). I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any real technical reason a microkernel couldn&#x27;t work on today&#x27;s hardware which is many orders of magnitude faster than what we had in 1992, but a hybrid kernel is always going to be faster.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanenbaum%E2%80%93Torvalds_debate"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanenbaum%E2%80%93Torvalds_deb...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.templeos.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.templeos.org/</a>",1446314974

There were some big changes just this month, in fact.<p>An interesting experience we had while preparing terms for a new on-line B2C service was being advised by a lawyer who is actually a barrister (i.e., one who does courtroom advocacy) rather than the more usual solicitor. Our lawyer was very strongly in favour of using plain language and of having important but potentially non-obvious or unexpected terms prominent and near the start of the agreement. In other words, he was very keen that the agreement really should be written how you would hope these things would be written. His argument was that if brown stuff ever actually hit the fan, it&#x27;s going to be up to a court to interpret the agreement, and that court is going to do so in a reasonable way based on what the parties involved thought they were signing up for. As such, it&#x27;s less likely that a court would uphold some sneaky term hidden on page 974 that no normal user would ever have read, but if you have something unusual and it&#x27;s clearly spelled out and prominently highlighted within the first few terms then it probably would stand up unless there&#x27;s some strong legal argument against it (such as being automatically unfair under the consumer protection laws, for example).",1446314831

10483497,comment,10482701,10482701,0,0,joesmo,,,"How about creating serious penalties for prosecutors who use falsified evidence, <i>regardless</i> of how it was obtained or their knowledge thereof. Our society, for whatever unfathomable reasons, places special trust in prosecutors (and police), trust that is placed without cause, reason, or consequence for it to be broken. Thus, we can expect much steeper penalties when things go wrong. If prosecutors faced the threat of jail for messing up cases, they&#x27;d be more careful. How about a day in jail for every day that is mistakenly assigned to an innocent person?<p>The argument that they need immunity is total bullshit and in no way reflects their actual job. In fact, removing immunity is the only way to make prosecutors accountable. If they are not 100% sure of their conviction, then they shouldn&#x27;t be convicting. Really simple logic. <i>If you can&#x27;t do your job within the law, you&#x27;re not doing your job, you&#x27;re just a criminal (as most prosecutors are morally).</i> Same for police. These two groups of public servants should be held to <i>higher</i> standards than the rest. For even minor offenses, there should be long jail times. It goes without saying that when offenses by prosecutors or law enforcement are investigated, special outside prosecutors and investigators are necessary.<p>Truth is, the solution is simple but it will never be implemented because no one in the US law enforcement/justice system cares about justice. The buck no longer stops anywhere. We have given these people such power that they are essentially all-powerful. It is beyond comprehension why our society would trust the scumbags who get jobs as prosecutors and police officers, usually the stupidest, meanest, most horrible people you can imagine that just can&#x27;t find work anywhere else and tend to have superiority complexes. These are the people we trust with life and death and then we wonder why thousands of innocent people are locked up or why our system is so fucking racist?<p>In America, solutions are simple, well defined, and actionable. Too bad no one who can act on them does. I think that is likely a huge reason for the decline of our society. The solutions exists and are obvious to anyone with a middle school education, yet we can&#x27;t seem to enact any of them. Is it any wonder that the people in charge of justice don&#x27;t care (and admit to not caring) about justice itself and who gets wrongfully convicted? Actually no. The nature of the power given to them almost dictates that they will abuse it. The sad part is that the people accept such an unjust situation and are satisfied with reciting cliched mantras like &quot;the land of the free&quot; all the while being enslaved by an incredibly unjust system.<p>Then again, most people affected by injustice in the US are either not white or poor.

It was fun to watch it all grow. I felt motivated to contribute, to share my own pages full of whatever information or opinions I happened to have. Photos of interesting places, stories about cities I&#x27;d visited, didn&#x27;t matter; it all seemed like it was worth sharing, because that&#x27;s what the web basically <i>was</i>.<p>I don&#x27;t find that anymore. Homepages came and went, blogs came and went, and if there&#x27;s still a thriving web out there beyond the big commercial sites, I don&#x27;t know where to look to find it.<p>I still have my personal site, and I still post on my blog occasionally, but it increasingly feels like calling into the wind. I&#x27;m not going to just switch over and post all the same stuff on some big commercial site; fuck that. The web was awesome when it looked like it was going to be a new way for humanity to talk to itself; now it seems like little more than another way for rich people to make money. It does that very impressively, but who cares? Rich people always had ways to make money and will always find more; it&#x27;s not very exciting when they turn yet another collaborative community project into a profit center.",1446314410

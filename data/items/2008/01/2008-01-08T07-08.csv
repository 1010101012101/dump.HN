Come out with a marginally interesting clone of something that's already been done to death (wikis, blogs, CMSs, project management, todo lists -- must be highly data driven). Promise to do one feature a day for a month or so and keep it up for about half a week<p>3. Merge with other sites that are doing better<p>4. Do jack shit - actually, work on ridiculously overambitious ""side projects"" on ""the weekend"". A book is a suitably ridiculous project. Also make sure everyone knows that you read a book a week. The world trembles before your intellectual might.<p>5. Take your share of the money when the people you're mooching off of get bought<p>6. Bitch and moan<p>7. Run like hell<p>8. (Profit was at step 5.)<p>9. Blog about all this to make you look like a fucking genius and say that you ""finished"" things you briefly mentioned doing but never actually started.<p>Yes I know, he has money and I don't.",1199778374

One group spent months (literally) drafting employment and consultant agreements, filing patents and trademarks, setting up various shell corporations to shield themselves from liability, etc etc and then hired an offshore development team to build the product.<p>The other guys just built the thing, only coding and talking to users, and were delighted to find that everything else  could be done retroactively.  They had tons of happy users before the first guys had anything but a gigantic stack of legal documents, nicely written but protecting nothing.<p>By the time they pitched the same VC, company B had probably a 1000x lead in user traction, with a growing spread.  Easy decision for the VC firm.  A is dead; B is a massive success.",1199777546

Add onions, pepper, mushrooms or any other supporting vegetable for enhanced flavor.  Continue stirring over a 8-9 flame for about 10 minutes.  Turn everything off, and dump your concoction over rice.  <p>Grilled Chicken:  Add spice to both sides of a chicken breast.  Different spices I've used are Old Bay, salt & pepper, soy sauce, Spike.  Put the meat into a Foreman grill, and cook for about 7 minutes, depending on the thickness of the chicken breast.  Serve with noodles or rice.  <p>Stir fry vegetables:  Clean and Chop said vegetable.  This works for napa, spinach, celery, string beans, zucchini, snap peas, etc.  Cook on 6-7 flame.  Add salt, oil, chopped garlic, dried shrimp to the wok.  Add vegetables.  Stir occasionally, and add a bit of water in the beginning to make sure the vegetables do not burn.  <p>If you have two woks, or one wok and one grill, you can cook the meat and vegetables at the same time, and be done and eating in about 20 minutes.",1190318328

The basic background strategy is to buy just what I need of the best values in my local grocery stores and markets. I often find creative ways to prepare them on recipe websites and food blogs. Though no longer out of work, I continue to cook frugally since the budget makes me focus on getting healthy things, using what I have on hand, and minimizing waste.</i>",1190317337

Look at the iPhone plan, it costs $20 more a month just to have unlimited text messages. Its just TEXT (and only 140 bytes per message maximum).<p>I dont think users will tolerate that kind of rape much longer when they can send emails (of basically unlimited length) for free.

Be sure to use extra vergine - life's too short for anything else.<p>3) Crush a clove of garlic with a garlic crusher, or cut it up finely, add in some red pepper (not too much though - it should be spicy, not hot).<p>4) Mix the spaghetti into the whole thing, until the garlic and peperonci and oil are evenly distributed.<p>Serve hot, and grate some Parmesan cheese on top.

57543,comment,57298,57298,0,0,slevin,,,"I think the biggest gaping hole in contribution to the world is the absence of leadership. It could very well take 10s of thousands of scientists another hundred years to solve our energy problems, but it only takes one person to stand up and convince us all to drive better cars, turn down our air conditioners, and purchase eco-positive products. Then we'd have 300million people working on the problem, making a difference now. And it would be a BIG difference.<p>During WWII the president asked the people to make sacrifices in order to win a war against some fairly bad people. If the president today asked people to stop eating meat for a day, the cattle lobby would have a cow (pun intended). They'd start tossing around money and it would be over. That's not leadership, that's middle management at best.<p>Maybe its too difficult (or impossible) to be a good leader these days, which may explain why most smart people really don't want the job. How can a leader spend 5 minutes on TV and tell everyone to eat better and even hope to compete with an evening full of fast food commercials. I don't think those are bad people, either. They're just another group of people, like many of us, trying to find a way to get ahead in this world so they can finally do some good. We're all a little aimless -- we need a leader.<p>So here's what I think any and all of us could do today:<p>1. Start making the sacrifices of a leader and getting people behind you to move the world in a positive direction.<p>-- or --<p>Accept that you aren't the person for the job (even for now) and rally your big throbbing brain behind someone who can and will lead.<p>2.

In a saucepot, heat 2 tbsp olive oil on medium.  Throw in the garlic.  Put a layer of the stale (hopefully not moldy) bread on the bottom.  Toast the bread a little in the pot. If you don't have stale bread, throw a handful of rice in instead (abt 2 tbsp). Then put 1 can of whole tomatoes in ($1 from safeway).  Canned tomatoes are better than produce section tomatoes because they are easier to use and canned when they're the freshest (food hack!).  Put half a can of water in.  When it boils.  Turn the heat to the low setting.  Chop a handful of basil.  Throw it in.  Come back in 40 minutes for something great.

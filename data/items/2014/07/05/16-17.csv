In 10 years of business I see about 5 jobs a year come in on average as a result of the website. My biggest jobs in fact were from clients who found me in a search. All in all I would say that over the span of time keeping my site updated (code-wise and content-wise) and SEO &quot;conscious&quot; has been very much worth the effort. Especially comsidering that I have yet to use social media tools as a means to attract potential clientele. I should state here that I am established freelance photographer who relies heavily on direct introductions and occasional bouts of cold calling and knocking on doors of potentials with my portfolio in hand. If I relied solely on the website to grow my client base I would have been out of business long ago.",1404579581

Examples might be...<p>- A podcast or blog or email list that talks about your product and your progress on it. ex: Startups for the Rest of Us and Drip app\n- a really good viral hook built into the product\n- Facebook ad strategy (probably not good for devops product)\n- a webinar strategy. (i.e. do a free monthly webinar on DevOps and have calls to action at the end)<p>Your key channel needs to be able to feed the funnel and end up with enough conversions to get you some compound growth going.<p>Whether you do it, or someone helps you, doesn&#x27;t matter. You still need to find that key channel.<p>I would probably recommend trying a personal blog/podcast + occasional webinars. you might even find a cofounder once you get this going.<p>The other thing I recommend is what I call &quot;The 2 person test&quot;. Find 2 people in your target market, show them the landing page. If at least 1 of them doesn&#x27;t go &quot;I need that!&quot; then you probably need to work on product/market fit.<p>good luck!",1404579575

At the same time it holds the more or less contradictory belief that CS curriculum should be concerned mostly with Computer Science and not mention much of the practical side of software development.<p>The ideal is that a good program will present the student with multiple opportunities to pick up practical skills on the go. No formal class and no grades, but exposure through lab work. The reality is that this requires everyone involved (students, instructors and various other support roles) to work longer and harder to achieve this tacit expectations.",1404579420

The problem with making a living on anything but a W2 is that the level of difficulty goes way up. I imagine living in poverty while attempting to run a business is quite common, there is even a term for being modestly profitable - ramen profitable.<p>Most people in your same position probably don&#x27;t want to do that. You need someone who can take care of the &quot;running a business&quot; parts. Maybe that isn&#x27;t so easy these days though, I don&#x27;t know.<p>You could do a search for posts by Patio11.

His posts are gold but they assume that you are actually into running a business.<p>It&#x27;s hard for me to weigh in on your social issues as I don&#x27;t have the same problem. You generally get better with practice though. Are there meetups that you can go to? Are there support groups for people who have the same sorts of issues? Maybe you could start out with social events for people who share your traits and then branch out from there.<p>ETA: I think most important is to be talking to people who share your condition. People who have been able to deal with it. Running a freelance / consulting business is hard enough. It&#x27;s even more difficult when you add a condition like yours. The market right now (and possibly more so when you first got started) is such that its pretty easy to get development gigs, especially for those willing to work for cheap.

7992353,comment,7988738,7991838,3,0,pron,,,"It is because I belong to that tiny group of developers who do care about programming languages that I even mention it. But I care <i>a lot</i> more about software in general, and if you look at the industry at large, absolutely no one (for all intents and purposes) cares about <i>any language</i> other than Java, C, C++, JavaScript and C# (plus some Matlab and maybe R, I guess). So I do have some strong opinions, but I put them in perspective. Until IBM, Oracle, Microsoft, SAP and a couple of large defense contractors -- all the true big players in software -- put their weight behind one or two &quot;new&quot; languages, all arguments over PL merits are kind of moot. Frankly, I don&#x27;t blame the big guys for not switching languages just yet. None of the challenger languages have shown such incredible advantages -- in correctness, performance or time to market -- to justify such a costly switch (certainly no world-changing benefits as C and Java offered). In fact, some technical leads in prominent SV companies have told me that their main reason for picking a non-mainstream language wasn&#x27;t technical: it was to appease their novelty seeking developers. I think there are two languages that <i>might</i> make a real difference -- Clojure and Haskell -- and they are, unfortunately, still far from conclusively proving their case. If Rust makes it to the embedded space, it could prove a real contender, too. In general, most new languages overpromise and underdeliver.",1404578980

For example, the point of my algorithm was to strip all style information from a page and show only the content, leaving it to be styled according to the global stylesheet. Notice that my script not only removes linked stylesheets and style tags, but also style attributes of all elements. The readability plugin actually does things like counting reference links and styling them a certain way [1].<p>It has 53 lines dedicated to both getting and normalizing the article title, when the vast majority of the time, it&#x27;s just the first h1 or HTML title attribute (which could be a one-liner and is also outside the scope of the &quot;meat algorithm&quot; since it&#x27;s just trying to get the body) [2].<p>It has 22 lines dedicated to injecting a custom readability footer into the page [3].<p>It has 74 lines dedicated to converting all inline links to footnotes [4].<p>It has 55 lines dedicated to injecting typekit fonts [5]. And on and on.<p>It also does things like figuring out when to float an image in the article and when to make it full-width [6] (as opposed to just leaving the image inline with no styling, as my script does).<p>And it even dedicates 333 lines of code to finding pagination links to build content from multi-page articles [7], which my script simply doesn&#x27;t do, since it only cares about the content of the current page.<p>It also does things like computing a content-weight score for parts of the page, I&#x27;m guessing to determine a relative heuristic for which parts are most likely to be the main content [8]. This is actually the path I had started to go down, before I realized that my much simpler version solved 95% of the use-cases I had, and that, for my purposes, I didn&#x27;t really care if it failed 5% of the time.<p>I think the discrepancy in complexity can be explained really easily:<p>a) The readability plugin does a <i>lot</i> of things not directly related to simply grabbing the content of the page.<p>b) There&#x27;s a lot of complexity involved in trying to get it to work for that last 5% (those are the really weirdly-structured sites, for which you&#x27;d need to develop some sort of heuristic and/or learning algorithm).<p>In other words, no, I didn&#x27;t exaggerate the success-rate. The readability plugin is just very functionally different. The algorithm in my article is also not the complete script; the algorithm was meant to be a base starting point to build from (certainly you would need to if you need greater than 95% success rate, which most applications would).<p><i>EDIT: Also should point out, my article was also meant to document my surprise in how easy it was to get a 95% solution. Most of the complexity I&#x27;ve seen in other scripts is in trying to figure out all HTML nodes on a page which could possibly be related to the main content, so that you can scan for them and reassemble only those nodes. The breakthrough for me was that if you can find one paragraph tag, then you can just go up a level or two to the containing node, and blindly grab all nodes, whatever they may be, within that containing node. The main pages this doesn&#x27;t work for are pages that don&#x27;t use paragraph tags in their article body (e.g. plain text with break tags all over the place, which were surprisingly few and far between with my sample set).</i><p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/Kerrick/readability-js/blob/4596857da3cc45fbbb18bac12d6ddbfd04e83d64/readability.js#L490-L536"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/Kerrick/readability-js/blob/4596857da3cc4...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://github.com/Kerrick/readability-js/blob/4596857da3cc45fbbb18bac12d6ddbfd04e83d64/readability.js#L295-L348"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/Kerrick/readability-js/blob/4596857da3cc4...</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://github.com/Kerrick/readability-js/blob/4596857da3cc45fbbb18bac12d6ddbfd04e83d64/readability.js#L350-L372"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/Kerrick/readability-js/blob/4596857da3cc4...</a><p>[4] <a href=""https://github.com/Kerrick/readability-js/blob/4596857da3cc45fbbb18bac12d6ddbfd04e83d64/readability.js#L462-L536"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/Kerrick/readability-js/blob/4596857da3cc4...</a><p>[5] <a href=""https://github.com/Kerrick/readability-js/blob/4596857da3cc45fbbb18bac12d6ddbfd04e83d64/readability.js#L538-L593js/blob/develop/readability.js#L538-L593"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/Kerrick/readability-js/blob/4596857da3cc4...</a><p>[6] <a href=""https://github.com/Kerrick/readability-js/blob/4596857da3cc45fbbb18bac12d6ddbfd04e83d64/readability.js#L230-L249"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/Kerrick/readability-js/blob/4596857da3cc4...</a><p>[7] <a href=""https://github.com/Kerrick/readability-js/blob/4596857da3cc45fbbb18bac12d6ddbfd04e83d64/readability.js#L1160-L1493"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/Kerrick/readability-js/blob/4596857da3cc4...</a><p>[8] <a href=""https://github.com/Kerrick/readability-js/blob/4596857da3cc45fbbb18bac12d6ddbfd04e83d64/readability.js#L693-L772"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/Kerrick/readability-js/blob/4596857da3cc4...</a>",1404578796

I was part of a small team that built a core web service from scratch in Haskell.  We had no idea what we were doing (feature-wise) when we started, and just put some stuff down.  Make it compile, see how writing the next bit of code works out.  If it&#x27;s terrible, refactor.  Every part of the Haskell toolchain is about empowering refactoring. Not with silly automated tools - with a set of language features that tell you when you didn&#x27;t think about something.<p>Even after the service was up and handling hundreds of requests per second (yes, really - it was hardly the company&#x27;s first foray, and we had a lot of customers lined up to use this as soon as it went live) we often found that the current design was severely hindering a new feature we wanted to add. So we&#x27;d just change the design. It wasn&#x27;t uncommon for an update to require changes to 20% of the lines in 75% of the files. And it was no big deal. The compiler had our backs, and made sure we made all the changes in a way that made sense. We didn&#x27;t <i>always</i> get it right - sometimes the system tests caught things the compiler missed, and on rare occasions a bug even slipped into production.  Such is life in a startup, right?<p>But here&#x27;s the thing.  At no point in the process was there a monolithic design done ahead of time.  In fact, it can hardly be said that there was any designing done ahead of time. Pretty much all the design work was a result of aggressive refactoring when adding new features. The whole process over years of development was nothing more than turning a quick and dirty exploratory prototype into a real, solid production system.<p>For contrast, an associated service was written using Rails, because we thought it&#x27;d be easy for what that service needed to do. It ended up being a nightmare to refactor and add new features. We were just never sure we got all the mechanical cases when something deep needed to be changed. Between the two, there&#x27;s just no question which system was better when you start out not having any clue what the product needs to be.",1404578697

Automobile safety engineering is a compromise of three factors cost, weight, and safety.

Interstates are the only environment where an automobile should exceed 55 MPH (if you&#x27;re obeying traffic laws). Roadside obstructions on an interstate are designed with this in mind. City streets are not. When you drive within the confines of traffic laws, you&#x27;re within the operating envelope. Exceed these parameters, and you&#x27;re pushing in to territory that was not explicitly considered when engineering the car.<p>Put more simply, there is no testing standard for impact with telephone poles at >55 MPH because that is never an expected outcome for accidents where operators are driving within an expected operating envelope.",1404577882

Right now, I use oDesk to try and minimize social interaction, but I&#x27;m back to doing the same stuff (LAMP stack PHP dev work) I was doing 13 years ago for less money...  still the notion of networking and &quot;selling myself&quot; is completely overwhelming to me.<p>I&#x27;m working with my local Vocational Rehabilitation office to update my Java skills (through O&#x27;Reilly) with the hopes of getting a good job, but I have to figure this out because the idea of having to leave my house for 8+ hours a day and deal with the social demands of people is a huge mental block for me, and causing me to freeze up from making any progress in school...

They are essentially subjective, and in practice are as &quot;socially true&quot; as they are commonly used. I guess the author is arguing that the more intuitively satisfying set of axioms excludes AoC.<p>I personally disagree, although I admit there&#x27;s still room for debate because of compelling arguments on either side (most of which are appeals to intuition by the nature of the problem).<p>Here&#x27;s a small counter-argument: Since we&#x27;re appealing to intuition, consider that we&#x27;re asking a countably infinite number of people to (a) see and reason based on seeing an infinite sequence in front of them; and (b) all memorize a specific function which is essentially from all the reals in [0,1] to a subset of [0,1], which we may think of as binary numbers with infinite expansions. (The intuitive point is clear without having to worry about 0.01111... being the same value as 0.1). This function is insanely weird and hard to describe succinctly; basically, it must be memorized. My intuition tells me that as soon as we expect agents to perform these feats, they are no longer humans and no longer Turing machines. Since this memorized function is so weird, they are even beyond some kind of infinite-time Turing machines with finite memories (or infinite-memory TMs with finite time). I think they are even beyond infinite-time Turing machines with countably-infinite memories, although I haven&#x27;t proven this carefully.<p>In the long run, I suspect an alternative axiomitization (or possibly an elegant classification of set theory statements) will shed light on these problems, somewhat analogous to the way we now consider non-Euclidean geometry as interesting and &quot;true&quot; in its own universe that we mentally separate from the Euclidean plane.<p>[ps Not <i>all</i> comments about axioms are appeals to intuition. E.g., you can prove some are independent or dependent. But arguments along the lines of this post are appeals to intuition when used for/against AoC.]",1404577524

One of the more fun ones is to do set theory but allow for some undefined relationships.  Aka x is in set A but it&#x27;s undefined if it&#x27;s in set B.  Now quick draw a venn diagram.",1404576331

It&#x27;s likely not possible.<p>The article is wild speculation, but so is everything regarding aliens. Even educated guesses are really just wild speculation because there are too many unknowns. We don&#x27;t even know how many worlds can support life, how many forms life can take, how often life might evolve intelligence, etc.<p>I wonder sometimes if maybe there&#x27;s a easter egg hidden in physics. If there were an easy way to convert matter to energy that we have yet to discover, we will likely destroy ourselves once we discover it. All it would take is one psycho with the right resources to unleash a kind of devastation that would make nuclear weapons look like fireworks. There might be no intelligent life out there because discovering the kind of energy resource that allows for easy interstellar travel might also make it too easy to kill ourselves.<p>Another possibility is the end game of intelligent life is not travelling around 21st century style, but digitizing our consciousness and living in a virtual world. Why travel to the stars when it makes more sense to turtle up in a giant computer and enjoy life? Something like a Dyson sphere.<p>Another possibility is the aliens are out there, they&#x27;ve just perfected the invisibility cloaks we&#x27;re currently working on. Star Trek style, they&#x27;re monitoring us unseen so as not to interfere with our civilization.<p>It&#x27;s fun to think about, but it&#x27;s all wild speculation at this point.",1404576299

Then I tried the Elemental Demo (we just watch right?) and it seemed to pause periodically through the demo. It seemed laggy in this regard and reminded me of when I play Rust even though that&#x27;s a Unity game. It&#x27;s still encouraging to see these companies get excited about Linux though, Linux rocks, no reason great game companies can&#x27;t rock with it.",1404576247

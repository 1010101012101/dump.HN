I also clarified that it was the tone of the developers response served as a red flag to me, the discount was of ill consequence.<p><i>Now, after some initial rounds of criticism (and the consequent derail of much of this thread), you've stooped to repeatedly decrying the decline of HN and its devolution into slashdot (although you are apparently finding posts that agree with you to be restorative of hope on that front).</i><p>I chose HN after a long stay out of all communities because I did not like the direction that most have them had taken. If you review my post history, you will find it evident that I do not make personal attacks and when I respond to someone, I try to to show them that I value their comment by providing what I think is a well thought out response.<p>Given my history of finding most sites pointless due to the noise to value ratio and what I feel is an investment of my time to help contribute to HN to make it what it's stated goals are, I do find it disheartening when a comment, that, if you take away the emotion, is totally devoid of value and whos only purpose was to serve as character assassination.<p>I mean can you honestly look at the post I complained about and defend it as being anything other than a pop shot. One thing I can say for sure, is that no matter my position on a subject, I would not support such a post. I have seen the trend other complain about, and have tried to deny it, make excused for it and ignore it.<p>So with it so evident in that post I decided to confront it, because I really do want to know if, when critically analyzed, do the members of HN support that kind of regard for other members, that offer a genuine post (whether you agree with it or not, my intent was to contribute to HN).<p>So given that I feel that I contribute value to HN, I want to know if this is how people that contribute are valued. Because if the answer is yes, then it is time for me to go.<p>I realized when I posted it, that it would most likely come off as that I am just sour about my message not being received, and people are free to infer what they will about my complaining about it, but if you take away the bias of my original post, go back and read that post, I think you will find it clearly evident that there was little regard for the contribution of a member and an intent to aggravate and malign for having a different view point that the majority.<p>I asked and would love an answer to is this now acceptable by the majority of HN. Obviously for my continuing to post, I do not believe it is, but the seed of doubt has been planted by other members that I respect so with an example of it so obvious, I felt compelled to not only highlight it but to confront the issue head on.",1291953423

Many of the better modules integrate with Views.  The top 20% of Drupal modules are decent, the remainder are to varying degrees quite amateurish.<p>If you find yourself writing a lot of PHP on a Drupal project, you're doing it wrong.  It's not just that the learning curve is steep, it's that the internals are a steaming pile.  The code is straight out of the last decade: large PHP functions sprinkled with SQL queries built up from concatenated strings.  It's no surprise that SQL injection vulnerabilities are still being found on almost a weekly basis in one module or another.  There is absolutely no transaction management; the assumption is that a Drupal site will be modified by a few and viewed by many.<p>The functionality of Drupal is powerful.  But stick to using modules and maybe a little bit of PHP helper code.  If you are implementing a lot of custom logic in PHP, you're better off using a more conventional (modern) web app framework.",1291953343

Maybe Google is merely claiming that netbooks with Chrome OS can replace some computers running full-fledged operating systems?<p>People might have owned only one computer (if any) in 1998, today it is very easy to afford many computers and computer-like devices. (You can basically buy two cheap laptops for the price of one middle of the road 1998 desktop.)

People want to be able to quickly check the weather, the news, that route, their emails and random stuff without leaving the living room.<p>I can’t speak for other households but for my parents their cheap living room laptop is the main computer in the household. They use it constantly to go online or read emails, the nice expensive desktop in the office gets hardly ever used.<p>Netbooks running Chrome OS and tablets (like the iPad) are perfectly capable of replacing those living room laptops.

1990527,comment,1989962,1990329,0,0,nl,,,"<i>Cute, except that Waterloo was Wellington's one and only victory over Bonaparte. It was the only time they met on the battle field, and even then, Michel Ney made most of the tactical decisions (and mistakes) on that day.</i><p>That's true, but Wellington defeated French armies numerous times. Indeed, I think this is why the quote is famous - instead of Napoleon being some magical fairy dust that made the French army invulnerable, Wellington was making the point that he'd defeated them before and the actual fighting at Waterloo unfolded much like it had in all of the other battles Wellington fought (eg, in the Peninsular campaign).<p>It also ignore just how close the battle was - indeed, most commentators think it is likely the French would have won if Napoleon had attacked Wellington earlier in the morning, instead of parading his army in an attempt to intimidate the British. (The argument is that he could have beaten the British before the Prussians arrived instead of having to split his forces). True or not, it does seem likely this was a mistake by Napoleon.<p>Wellington was <i>a reactionary, anti-democratic, ennobled aristocrat</i>, but in many ways he was a better <i>manager</i> of his army than Napoleon was. For example, he always made sure his armies were supplied with food without having to steal from the local population. It was Wellington's logistical innovations in India that allowed the British to subdue the sub-continent - despite French attempts to stop them.",1291953184

1990513,comment,1987780,1990107,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Take a proto-stellar nebula, it's a big mass of gas and dust thousands of AU in diameter. Each particular bit will generally be moving very slowly in a random direction relative to the whole but the whole thing has some particular <i>net</i> angular momentum. As the nebula collapses to form a star this angular momentum gets concentrated (insert standard ice-skater pulling in their arms description here), which is why stars tend to have some particular spin. The same mechanism of concentration works to help form a protoplanetary disc. Objects in eccentric orbits or orbits tilted to the average plane of the forming disc will be more prone to collisions, causing them to be absorbed or captured by larger bodies or to form a debris cloud of generally lower eccentricity and lower inclination.<p>Over time these effects add up to cause most of the mass in the inner Solar System to be concentrated in a small number of planets in circular orbits within a narrow range of inclinations.<p>Note that in the far outer Solar System of the kuiper belt and oort cloud these effects are much diminished (orbital periods are much longer, distances are much larger, overall volumetric mass densities are lower, etc.) so objects are more likely to have eccentric and inclined orbits relative to the inner solar system consensus.",1291952781

Among other things, when the court fights first started, Facebook sued ConnectU, the Winklevoss brothers, <i>and</i> Mr. Chang for what is known as declaratory relief. This is a special court remedy by which a party can anticipate that another party will sue for relief and beat that party to the punch by suing first. The point of the preemptive suit is to file in a favorable venue and ask the court to consider and resolve the conflicting claims to the subject matter in dispute (here, the rights to FB's assets). Thus, Facebook sued all these parties in order to get a declaration (and judgment) from the court that neither ConnectU nor any other party had any rights to the FB assets but that, instead, Mr. Zuckerberg and FB owned all such assets free and clear of any of their claims. This included asking for such a declaration against Mr. Chang as well.<p>According to the allegations in Mr. Chang's suit, the Winklevoss brothers retained counsel to defend the declaratory relief action and also paid for such attorneys to represent Mr. Chang as well. Mr. Chang then alleges that his own attorneys sold him out in favor of the Winklevoss brothers by failing to advise him properly concerning the settlement that was ultimately reached in the case by which the brothers received a huge payout and he got nothing (he claims that he and the brothers had formed an entity into which the assets of ConnectU, including the FB-related  rights, were transferred and that he therefore owned up to half those assets and should have received up to half the settlement proceeds as a result of this).<p>So you have claims that the Winklevoss brothers stole what belonged to Mr. Chang, that Mr. Zuckerberg then stole what belonged to the brothers and Mr. Chang either separately or jointly, and that the attorneys representing the brothers and Mr. Chang connived with the brothers to stick the knife into Mr. Chang while extorting a massive payout from FB. And, to cap it off, the brothers and ConnectU have moved to set aside this settlement because they claim the Mr. Zuckerberg misled them about the value of the FB stock when he did the settlement.<p>Definitely one for the books.",1291952510

1990441,comment,1988429,1988429,0,0,thinkingeric,,,"""They were not built to solve a business need""<p>That's not quite correct. It is perhaps more accurate to say they weren't built to solve your primary business need. They certainly solve the problem of getting unskilled people to be productive at some level. And this is not a trivial consideration. It takes a great deal of effort, time, and expertise to design a system that maximizes programmer productivity, such that an ideal minimum number of 'programmer-hours' is all that is  required to augment and maintain it. And when you do, it is likely that it requires 'wizard level' programmers to put in those hours. Expertise is expensive, hard to find, and presents a certain replacement risk for an employer.<p>The alternative is more dumbed-down systems. The code is less elegant or clever, but easier to understand and imitate. And the 'brutish' nature of such code leads to a certain amount of repetition, which requires more 'programmer-hours' to work on. Hence the need for more developers. As many folks have pointed out, programming today is very much a social activity. The systems themselves are partly responsible for this. There is a need for developers to be 'hot swappable'.<p>And the staffing pressures are partly what are responsible for the popularity of frameworks, for similar reasons. Frameworks are development languages that sit on top of programming languages. In many cases, you barely even need to know the underlying programming language in order to produce fairly sophisticated results. In contrast, to be productive in programming languages, you need to have a fairly deep understanding of your craft and have a good bit of experience in the quirks of that language.<p>Frameworks are like DSLs for a technical domain. While it can take some time to learn the framework language, you can produce more, faster than if you have to build software from scratch (or using just libraries). But what are you producing? As the author says, they are built for ""20,000 or 200,000"" developers. Not you. And not your problem. They may solve common problems, but they don't necessarily solve your particular problem in the most appropriate way. You may need to rethink your problem to fit what the framework can accommodate. Or face the staffing dilemma.",1291950967

She was big on there being objective truth -- it's not all just opinion. She was big on reason -- she wanted human civilization to make progress by people using their minds. She liked science but criticized scientists overly concerned with funding, for example, at the expense of boldly seeking potentially unpopular truths.

My opinion of the display is that the compromise was visible but not bad: the color definitely isn't as vibrant as a traditional color LCD or OLED, but the daylight view-ability was very good vs. a traditional backlit LCD that becomes poor or unreadable in bright sunlight.<p>There are some pictures on the Groklaw article, although I was focusing on size rather than the display when I took the pictures.  In retrospect, I should have focused on the display more than the size. :-/\n<a href=""http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20080128171935946"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20080128171935946</a>",1291950212

I was just trying to write a blog post using it, actually. To get a picture from my phone and into the post, right now Google wants me to upload it from the phone to the cloud, then down to my machine. Sneakernet also works -- might be nice to support that, too. And it'll come.",1291950192

147272,comment,147077,147186,0,0,wanorris,,,"There's also an aspect that goes beyond a new technology simply being irrelevant or less useful than an an old technology beyond simple ego and fear of irrelevance.<p>Consider an example from the original post. For the world of computing at large, GUIs are a giant win. But many expert computer users prefer a command line for many or even most tasks, and some even use windowing systems like xmonad or ratpoison that are optimized for command-line use.<p>Likewise, while word processors have taken over a lot of the market for creating documents, many programmers are much more likely to use text editors -- often ones that trace their heritage back to the 70s like emacs or vim.<p>There's nothing wrong with these new technologies, but it's perfectly valid for people to not prefer them, right? Some newer, friendlier technologies may be better for people who don't want to go through a learning curve, but may actually be <i>worse</i> for people who have already gone through the learning curve or are willing to do so in the future. Perfectly normal.<p>Here's the thing, though: when there is a large community of people who are using your technology (whether a CLI, a text editor, a relational database, or a programming language), there are a lot more new, useful tools being built on top of that technology. This means that someone producing a new technology will siphon resources away from a technology that earlier users consider superior for their uses.<p>Irrespective of being considered irrelevant, having fewer new tools at your disposal actually reduces what you can get done. Which sucks, right?",1206565072

I agree that a practical discussion is how to work together in a business, but dismissing or discrediting the discussion with an anecdotal counter example doesn't add or address any new ideas.<p>And I agree that there are many generalizations, and I purposely avoided hedging language to pad them. They do not apply to everyone in all cases, which is why they are generalizations.

I wasn't asking you to judge my architectural decisions, thanks.  ;)<p>I think it's besides the point whether or not an RDBMS can handle a given app's data; it almost certainly can.  The real question is should people dogmatically choose an RDBMS for every single data persistence problem they need to solve.<p>While the article's title is obviously hyperbole, I think the dissent against choosing the RDBMS model of storing knowledge is a good one.  I see the decision that system architects are faced with here as being an end-to-end argument: should the protections and optimizations provided by relational databases be enforced at such a low level or are dumb databases that delegate those features to other layers better design?  There's decent evidence for the latter.",1206563323

147244,comment,147124,147124,0,0,davidmathers,,,"Here's the comment I left on Hank's blog:<p>Hi Hank, I like to be brief so this might sound bad, but I mean everything in the friendliest possible way.<p>You and almost all the people arguing against you are wrong about almost everything. I don't mean to say anyone's opinion is wrong. I'm talking about basic understanding of what certain words mean.<p>Let me break it down. There are 3 models for ""programming"" (in the general sense) computers:<p>1. Functional
2. Relational
3. Imperative<p>The functional model can't store data and therefore can't be used to create a database. So there are fundametally only 2 kinds of databases.<p>A database created using the Relational model uses relations to both store and retrieve data, so lets call it a relational database. A database created using the Imperative model uses pointers & nodes to store data and pointer navigation to retrieve data, so lets call it a navigational database.<p>That's it. There are only 2 database models. Each model can be used to implement different kinds of databases based on the limits they place on the structure.<p>There are 2 primary kinds of navigational database: graph/network and tree/hierarchy. A filesystem for example is a tree/hierarchy database.<p>A relation is basically a truth table with columns that are related to each other by a truth statement and rows of truth values that fulfill the truth of the statement. A standard relational database doesn't place any limits the number of rows or columns. A binary database limits the numbers of columns to 2.<p>A SQL DBMS is a (partially successful) attempt to implement a language that can be used to create a database which uses relational model.<p>OK, the important parts:<p>1. The semantic web is an implementation of the relational model that limits the relations to 3 columns and a single row.<p>2. Just because you use a SQL DBMS to create a database doesn't mean you actually created a relational database. You can put pointers in your tables, turning your relations into nodes on a graph, turing your database into a navigational database with some relational features.<p>Much of what you said in your original post was exactly backwards. You said ""relational sucks"" but the things you described as problems were features of navigational databases, not relational. Then you said ""the semantic web is awesome because it's a navigational database"" when in fact it's a relational database.<p>That's all.",1206563205

I'm not the world's biggest fan of modal lightboxes, but when I first tried to rate/vote on Reddit and it let me login without taking away my entire screen to another page, it was a good feeling.<p>Other than that, I have friends in this space and it's ultra competitive and getting tougher. I like the twist of coming up with recommendations for a group, but it's rare for me where that is useful for TV. I'd almost rather it provide recommendations for a video game, movie, or board game than just a TV show.<p>Having things disappear when I rate them is a little painful. I keep trying to quickly move down the list to rate more things, but then it refreshes (it seems) and I'm disoriented trying to figure out where to rate next.<p>Maybe it would help if it just said ""Rate one of the below shows"" and gave you a Thanks! response after you did it?

CVS is the only VCS that I know of that lets you do this.<p>Most (if not all) centralized VCS have no issue with letting you lock files (for those where locking is not default or mandatory à la Perforce of course). SVN for instance lets you not only lock files [0] but mandate that files be locked before edition based on their filetype [1] which is usually set for binary and other non-mergeable files. DVCS do not allow for locking because the concept hardly makes sense in a distributed context, so you have to rely on a centralized third-party to manage locks in that context.<p>[0] <a href=""http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.5/svn.ref.svn.c.lock.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.5/svn.ref.svn.c.lock.html</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.5/svn.advanced.locking.html#svn.advanced.locking.lock-communication"" rel=""nofollow"">http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.5/svn.advanced.locking.html...</a>",1296726523

The rule against split infinitives was invented in the mid 19th century, and was not accepted by the majority of leading grammarians. It did become popular with journalists and the general public, though.<p>Most modern authorities say there is nothing inherently wrong with splitting infinitives, although it is often a sign of a weak sentence. Sometimes, though, any rewrite to remove the split infinitive would make the sentence awkward of ambiguous in which case splitting the infinitive would be the preferred form.<p>The rule against ending a sentence with a preposition is even weaker. It is often described by grammarians as ""spurious"" or a ""myth"".<p>Both of these are covered well here:<p><a href=""http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/page/grammartips/grammar-tips"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/page/grammartips/grammar-t...</a>",1296725932
2174228,comment,2173290,2173290,0,0,bermanoid,,,"tl;dr: the art/sound/etc. assets may have been accidentally released under the GPL because of a file omission in the .zip version of the source release.<p>From the article: ""<i>According to Kotaku, they are talking about the GPL release of the source code for a number of the Humble Indie Bundle games, namely this post. However, the license made it very clear that the authors retained all rights to the assets, characters, and everything else aside from the code itself.</i>""<p>Disclaimer: I'm not a lawyer, I might be wrong here about some things, so please step in and correct me if anyone knows better.<p>So, here's the thing. Looking at the source .zip linked at <a href=""http://blog.wolfire.com/2010/05/Lugaru-goes-open-source"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.wolfire.com/2010/05/Lugaru-goes-open-source</a> (the .zip file itself is at <a href=""http://akamai.wolfire.com/humble/src/lugaru-srcs-final.zip"" rel=""nofollow"">http://akamai.wolfire.com/humble/src/lugaru-srcs-final.zip</a>, so that's an official release), I see COPYING.txt, the generic GPLv2 statement, sitting at the root of the project .zip.  By custom, I would naturally assume that unless that license is overridden somewhere, it's the license in effect for all copyrightable materials included in nested directories.<p>I'm not positive about this legally speaking, but I'm <i>pretty</i> sure that if the code is distributed in such a fashion, and most people familiar with code would interpret the license to apply in such a manner (to everything in the subdirectories, unless overridden somewhere within the released code), I can safely assume I've been granted that license.<p>Now, I fully believe that Wolfire never intended to release the art/sound/character assets under the GPL.  But - and I encourage people to check for themselves to make sure I'm not missing something, I could definitely be wrong - <i>there appears to be no license statement anywhere inside that particular source distribution (<a href=""http://akamai.wolfire.com/humble/src/lugaru-srcs-final.zip"" rel=""nofollow"">http://akamai.wolfire.com/humble/src/lugaru-srcs-final.zip</a>) that puts any of those assets under another license</i>.<p>I suspect the file at <a href=""http://hg.icculus.org/icculus/lugaru/file/97b303e79826/CONTENT-LICENSE.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hg.icculus.org/icculus/lugaru/file/97b303e79826/CONTE...</a>, the one that sets the license terms on that data, is what the author of the post was referring to when mentioning the clear license terms.<p>But someone forgot to copy it from the hg repo into the .zip file before they released it.<p>Unfortunately, they didn't forget to put COPYING.txt in at the root, which means GPL2 for the whole shebang (the default license would have been none at all, but for the presence of that file).  If I'm right, and no other license is hiding somewhere, then as far as I can tell (not a lawyer) those assets are under GPL.  It doesn't matter if comments elsewhere clearly prove that the GPL was only supposed to cover the code, a release was made and linked by the original copyright holder with a license statement whose clearest reading grants the user a license to <i>everything</i> under the GPL.  Prevailing wisdom seems to be that you can't take back a GPL license, so yes, that means that all the assets in this game have been accidentally open sourced.<p>There's still a trademark claim, of course, this joker can't legally call his game Lugaru, but if he renames it, he's within his rights to try to sell it as long as he branched from the .zip release (though the GPL issue might keep it off the App Store).",1296725925

The Prime Minister has personally come out against the issue[1] as well, so it looks like there is a fair amount of political resistance to UBB in general.<p>The CRTC needs to be disbanded. This will be the second government overruling of their decisions in as many months[2], so perhaps it will make them a little more measured in their approach should they again approach the UBB issue. If the CRTC constantly needs to be kept in check by the government, then perhaps it will incentivize the government to disband the CRTC as the government will already be doing their job for them anyway.<p>[1] <a href=""http://twitter.com/pmharper/status/32526091855863808"" rel=""nofollow"">http://twitter.com/pmharper/status/32526091855863808</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://news.gc.ca/web/article-eng.do?crtr.sj1D=&mthd=tp&crtr.mnthndVl=&nid=501719&crtr.dpt1D=&crtr.tp1D=1&crtr.lc1D=&crtr.yrStrtVl=&crtr.kw=&crtr.dyStrtVl=&crtr.aud1D=&crtr.mnthStrtVl=&crtr.yrndVl=&crtr.dyndVl="" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.gc.ca/web/article-eng.do?crtr.sj1D=&mthd=tp&...</a>",1296724821

As others said you are not providing enough information.  I don't want to have to sign up to discover what you offer.

The shirt concept itself is not completely unique as we've all seen ""I SURVIVED ..."" shirts before, but the copycat shirts used the same font, word placement, and everything. Am I upset? Absolutely not. Those just validate my idea. And I wasn't too worried about losing sales as the copycats were way overpriced ($24+s/h vs $16) with lower quality and far inferior presentation. I would be surprised if they sold any at all, really.<p>2) The copycat shirts went as far as using very similar descriptions for the shirts. Not only does this show a complete lack of creativity, it shows that I may have been onto something with the humorous/witty/questionable description that has been mentioned here a few times. Is it offensive? Possibly. But I think it did more good than harm (in terms of measurable things like sales and hits).<p>Just thought I'd throw those thoughts out there for pondering.",1296723925
2174170,comment,2174011,2174111,0,0,Zev,,,"As little as I like IB, it being a black box is not one of my complaints. A xib is just an xml file. You can open it up in a text editor and see what happened. You can copy the xib, set an option and diff the two files and clearly see what it did. Dragging lines around is just a different way of setting a target/action pair. Dragging views just sets the frame for you rather than you setting it, etc etc.<p>Now, if you wanted to argue that IB is bad because XIBs don't merge easily, I might agree with you[1]. Or even that nib loading is slow iOS 3.x[2]. It does make it slightly harder to use custom views, I suppose. But, <i>a lot</i> of the views I make are just existing views combined, not so much custom drawing[3]. And IB excels at that.<p>1. I'd actually say this is a failing of almost every VCS out there because it doesn't let you lock files. CVS is the only VCS that I know of that lets you do this.<p>// edit: As masklinn and shaggyfrog point out below, this isn't quite true. Centralized vcs's let you lock files, dvcs's don't. The point is that merge conflicts suck — and with xibs, can't be fixed..<p>2. UINib on iOS 4 makes nib loading much faster and much less of an issue.<p>3.

This isn't a bad thing, though it means the business runs the risk of being overtaken by a company that builds its brand with end consumers through the affiliate route.",1209448432

176352,comment,175864,176270,0,0,run4yourlives,,,"Most Christians who've actually thought of their faith, (admittedly, that's few and far between) have most certainly already reconciled their beliefs with this subject. Off the top of my head, I'd imagine a reconciled Christian would say:<p>1. Aliens are not in the Bible, but nothing says they don't exist.
2. The Bible is God's message to man, and surely the Aliens will have their own message from the same God. (Actually, considering the similarities of Earth's religions, wouldn't that be something?) I digress.<p>Point being, the search for God will continue forever. It's part of human nature, and is ultimately an unknowable equation. Even with a thousand known species, people will ask why we are, and that can often lead to ""because you were made to be"".<p>I think it's foolish to expect a mass awakening on the discovery of ET. It's not going to happen. You'll have a few that will alter their beliefs, a few that will go wacko (thinking crazy white haired dude from Contact here) and everyone else will just ponder it for a while and carry on.",1209447826

In other words, of necessity or as close to it as probability allows, intelligent life must destroy the sustainability of its home planet before it achieves the technology capable of leaving it.<p>Of course, by leaving it I'm talking on the scale required to explore and interact with neighbouring solar systems, not just sending Voyager 1 out there with a picture on its side.",1209447605

Reiser showed up at his childrens' school the day after Labor day, the first school day after Nina disappeared and a day when Nina was supposed to pick up the kids. The prosecuter claims he was making sure the police didn't show up to ask where the kids' mother was. Reiser claims he went there to add his mother, Beverly Palmer, to the list of people that could pick up the kids. He was scheduled to pick up the kids the next day.<p>2. Hans' Honda CRX was missing the front passenger seat. It went missing sometime after he got a speeding ticket (after Nina disappeared) and before the police seized the vehicle.<p>3. Hans admits his hosed out the inside of the car. He removed the seat and threw it away. He also removed the carpet and disposed of it.<p>4. The car was also missing a piece of trim that Hans admits to throwing out.<p>5. Han's admits he was trying to hide the car from the police.<p>6. Nina's van was found three miles from Hans' home. Her cell phone was found in the van with the battery removed.<p>7. When Hans was taken into custody his cell phone did not have a battery in it. On the stand he claimed that he did not remove the battery from his own phone. He later admitted he lied about that. He actually removed it frequently after Nina disappeared.<p>8. Along with his cell phone, Hans was carrying his passport and several thousand dollars in cash.<p>9. Reiser was seen hosing down the driveway to his mother's home shortly after Nina disappeared.<p>10. The police found two books on murder in Reiser's car. He had purchased them with cash shortly after Nina disappeared.<p>11. He paid a $5,000 retainer to a criminal defense attorney just days after Nina disappeared, while the investigation was still a missing person's case. He didn't even bother to try calling her to find out if she was alive before he shelled out for the retainer.",1209445785

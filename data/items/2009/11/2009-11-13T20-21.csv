The artists you ever saw in a record store, on the Billboard TopN, or playing big live shows are the vast, vast minority.<p>Countless artists just as talented never got that break, which was decided at the whim of record execs. A certain number of artists would be propped up for a period of time, and if some fell out of favor, they would be cut away and replaced from the endless supply of new ones doing anything they can to break in. There was a maximum number of acts that a record company would support at once, since that was the optimum number they had calculated for making profits; there was so much money being spent on things like marketing, advertisement campaigns, award ceremonies, etc and it you could generate more money by selectively picking just a few dozen artists to be ""allowed"" to be famous and marketing them like crazy.<p>The music industry is hugely, hugely better for actual artists today.

I spent a month or so evaluating the platforms, interviewing developers who were proponents of one or the other, talking to friends and colleagues who had strong opinions, reading lots of other blogs, and diving into tutorials and documentation for both frameworks. In the end, I formed my own opinions shaped by the people I talked to, the things I read, and my own experiences. In the post, I'm not even attempting to provide concrete data - and most of my points are about things that you'd have a hard time measuring anyway, like philosophy and culture.<p>I'm not trying to stand on a soap box one way or the other here.

Fiction:  Data doesn't require lots of work to make it useable, so we can just upload whatever we have and it will be useful to somebody.  Fact: the big useable datasets (census, ipums, nlsy, all the private marketing datasets) have armies of people cleaning and integrating them.  It costs money, it takes time, and it is easy to screw up.<p>2.  Fiction:  Links are worth something.  Fact:  links are worthless.<p>3.  Fiction: XML adds values.  Fact:  aascii tab delimited in consistent formats add value, while XML SUBTRACTS value.<p>4.  Fiction: a good dataset is easy to use.  Fact:  even a good dataset (google IPUMS for an example) takes a lot of work to get to know how to manipulate, presuming one can use some sort of statistical programming language in the first place.<p>5.  Fiction:  simple summaries of common data data are useful.  Fact:  everybody has already done the simple summaries.  (This is just a bonus item, and doesn't apply to data.gov, but does apply to faulty thinking about data in general.)<p>6.  Fiction: Federated data is just fine.  Fact:  Data that is curated, cleaned, and integrated into one big monolithic package is FAR better, because an analyst can then learn the  conventions and names and such in one piece, and parallel categories are more likely to align.<p>7.  Fiction:  Good data is easy for a layperson to use.  Fact: good data still requires a lot of skill. Well, maybe in nations with decent public schools a layperson can do something with data, but not in the US.<p>What I WOULD like is the following (taken from another post, now deleted):<p>An ideal data.gov would have a lot of staff who put together a few integrated and curated datasets from the agencies. These would be hierarchies of data in a few formats (shp, txt, raster, SQL text dump, and ...?), along with well written codebooks and narrative READMEs. They would be distributed using git or subversion. The staff would have the expertise to make such nice data packages for you and me, and they would have the political oomph to demand that the agencies release the data to them. The staff would also give classes on how to use the data along in some open source statistical packages to do useful work.
Good examples of curated data that I know are IPUMS and the Portland Metro's RLIS (both google-able).",1258143869

Marketing seeks to identify customers.<p>In a manner of consideration, Adams is seeking to acquire better and more targeted search results, or skills in searching for products or services.    Google Adwords tries to offers something close.  But the Googlers are not very good at this level of targeting.  (Yet?)<p>As for specifically contacting buyers, that's expensive for commodity gear.  And what happens when you find and proffer a product to a customer, and the customer turns around and purchases that product from the lowest bidder; if you can't automate this and keep the customer acquisition costs (very) low, a business ends up a variant of the Brick-and-Mortar cost differential.<p>The middle ground - some form of a trusted concierge or consulting service or search service - seems to be one of the few potentially approaches from both directions; back to what amounts to a (trusted) middleman in the purchasing process.<p>And a concierge service has inherent costs.",1258142594
940666,comment,940403,940432,0,0,kalid,,,"Hey, thanks for the comment.<p>Yep, there is a fundamental tension between intuition and rigor. Unfortunately, I feel that rigor (and not even rigor -- rote details) are overemphasized, without giving any context, and more importantly without giving any inspiration to the student. It's like focusing on the spelling of a poem, not the content.<p>I do want to jump into the rigorous definitions in later posts (such as when limits exist, when they don't, why it's important) but I find intuition -> rigor is an easier path to navigate than rigor -> intuition [which often becomes rigor -> memorization]. If someone had just said ""Hey, limits and infinitesimals help us solve the problem of 'How do we make an approximation which is still accurate enough?'"" calculus would have clicked a lot faster for me :).",1258142592

When you start the form with ""Will and I"", that doesn't mean too much to most people who don't know either of you.<p>2) More quantitative choices. For example, one of the questions is:<p>How often do you make reservations online?
    * Never.
    * I have, but not frequently.
    * Occasionally.
    * Whenever possible.<p>What is the difference between infrequently and occasionally? Something like ""never"", ""every month or two"", ""every week or two"", and ""several times per week"" might be more useful for you and easier to fill out for everyone else.",1258142517

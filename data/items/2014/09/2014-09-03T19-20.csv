I&#x27;ve done this in 1-on-1 meetings with managers in the past.  If they think you&#x27;re worth keeping, they will do what they can to give you a raise when the time comes.  But keep in mind that other people on their team maybe be underpaid more than you, so they might try to correct those people&#x27;s salaries first.<p>At least from what I&#x27;ve seen, managers at some level (your direct manager, or their manager) are given some numbers of dollars to increase the salary of the employees.  They have to choose how to distribute that between their people.<p>Depending on the company, it may take you moving to a different company to get what you&#x27;re worth.  Most companies know that transitioning jobs is difficult and a lot of people won&#x27;t go through the effort.  Because of this they will underpay people that they don&#x27;t think are going to leave.  If you want to try, apply around, interview, and get a job offer at another company.  Present it to your manager and see what they say.  Some companies will counter-offer, while others have policies where they will not counter-offer.<p>Story: a friend was offered a contracting position with the same company he already worked for (from the contracting firm, the company didn&#x27;t know yet), that would be paying far more than he was making.  He didn&#x27;t take it and his manager didn&#x27;t do anything to correct his salary.  But it was pretty funny to see.",1409773973

It&#x27;s an interesting case: claims that hands naturally do this or that quite often don&#x27;t take any account of just how versatile a tool it can be. But on the other hand (oops!) it is absolutely vital that any object intended for use in the hand has the utmost attention paid to the design: anything that causes discomfort becomes in an instant completely unusable.",1409773831

An agency can have a success rate of 20% at preventing violence (in which case they are lousy at it) or they can have a 70% or 80% rate or higher and so on. So sure, the government is preventing people from hurting people at some particular rate. Your question is, how can we make sure people don&#x27;t hurt other people if there&#x27;s no government. Well, let&#x27;s say we all live in this city. Do we want a police force? If we do, we can fund one and have it. Then it will protect us. Same as current taxes for police forces, only at local level. It&#x27;s no different than having tinier countries. Switzerland is tiny and peaceful and they have a police force but they also have everyone armed and so everyone can help protect others that may be being harmed. And in general you will see less people being harmed if everyone is able to help.<p>Now on to your example. You&#x27;re the only employer in town. Maybe you even own the land where people live, just to make it more challenging. Now you can &quot;exploit&quot; people all you want by choosing not to employ someone you think is ugly or annoying, let&#x27;s say. Well, let&#x27;s say I&#x27;m ugly and you don&#x27;t employ me. I&#x27;m ugly but I have friends. People know me and because I&#x27;m a nice guy they like me and are willing to help me. Several things can come from this. If everyone likes me then now we&#x27;re all the more empowered as a town to go on strike and advocate that the company change their hiring policy. But let&#x27;s say the town hates me, I&#x27;m a terrible person. I can try to redeem myself in the eyes of my town by providing services to my townsfolk, slowly building up enough savings to perhaps move out of town.<p>I&#x27;ve tried my best to honestly answer your questions.

If it&#x27;s a matter of cost, some billionaire would figure out how to build it even without government approval.<p>How many people build nuclear bombs? Or supercolliders? Nuclear reactors are an altogether different thing, particularly if you&#x27;re not concerned about producing surplus energy. Despite the fact that the principles behind nuclear weaponry are known, even few governments have (independently) built them and they are very strictly controlled. I can easily imagine the engineering required for time machines is even more complex, the materials as hard to acquire, the energy expenditures prohibitive, etc. And if time travelers could change history, then they would surely be regarded as incredibly dangerous superweapons, not something Elon Musk-types can just build and hop into on a lark. Indeed one could even imagine a future in which time machines are feasible but there&#x27;s a &quot;MAD&quot; principle at work keeping anyone from building one - so if any were built, they would be kept top secret and time travelers would act with as much secrecy and delicacy as possible.<p>To me the idea &quot;we have not seen time travelers; ergo this class of time machine cannot exist&quot; is a failure of imagination. Other reasons I can imagine: human civilizations never devote the necessary resources to engineering a time machine; some social collapse or stagnation prevents technology from progressing beyond some given point; humans or human civilization is wiped out before the invention of time machines by any number of social or natural disasters; it is more difficult to travel further back in time, so nobody goes this far back, though they can go before the creation of the time machine; the singularity happens and post-singularity transhumans don&#x27;t care about traveling to pre-singularity times; etc.<p>> And Titor&#x27;s predictions, even the really short-term ones, were so off the mark that there&#x27;s no reason to think it&#x27;s anything other than a prank. Note that even the many-worlds hypothesis would have the short-term predictions coming true and only the longer-term predictions becoming more and more inaccurate (more importantly, any differences should be due to his presence, and his presence did not e.g. cause CERN to fail to discover the basis for time travel in 2001).<p>I don&#x27;t believe Titor was a time traveler either, but you can make reasonable arguments about why his predictions were incorrect: his presence changed the future in unanticipated ways, the MWI model of time travel doesn&#x27;t actually send you to a world that branches off from your arrival time, CERN actually did discover time travel, etc. I don&#x27;t find any of these plausible but I am also not willing to categorically assert we have no evidence of time travelers or that an analysis of Twitter is even weak evidence that time travel is not possible.",1409773485

Fantastic hardware, abysmal software that&#x27;s so bad I went back to an iPhone 4S until the iPhone 6 comes out.<p>A few examples so you know I&#x27;m not just talking from my nether regions. S Note: great until it loses data. I think they&#x27;ve fixed it since, but not something I&#x27;m inspired to use for serious note taking. I mean, c&#x27;mon, your premier differentiating feature (take notes with a stylus) loses my data? Image Gallery: it has never worked. Take some pictures, there&#x27;s <i>no way</i> to view them without a 3rd party app because Image Gallery pretends they don&#x27;t exist. It did this straight out of the box. Reset the phone once (for reason other than Image Gallery), and it still didn&#x27;t work. Those are just two examples, I&#x27;ll not bore anyone with the rest.<p>I bought the Gear Fit. Again, nice hardware and a steaming pile of shit for firmware/software. Advertised features just plain didn&#x27;t work (confirmed by others). At this point it looks like those advertised features are never going to work because Samsung has moved on to the next big idea.<p>Until Samsung can somehow convince me that the software running on their hardware is something more than just an afterthought written by summer high school interns (with apologies to high school interns that don&#x27;t suck), it&#x27;s the last piece of Samsung kit I will ever buy.<p>Samsung strikes me as a company that comes out with some great hardware ideas, and then doesn&#x27;t know what to do with them. Alternatively, they might think cool hardware is enough, and software isn&#x27;t an important part of the user experience.

That said... a word of caution. I absolutely loved my Note II when I first upgraded from my iPhone 4 two years ago, and now I&#x27;m starting to despise it.<p>I rather suspect that Samsung is deliberately hobbling my Note II with Touchwiz iterations. The phone is drastically slower than it was when I bought it, despite reformats and careful management of open apps. The camera is no longer accessible from the lock screen and takes eons to open after unlocking. Once the camera app is loaded, I have to manually turn on HDR EVERY SINGLE TIME. And the pictures it takes are pretty terrible -- there seems to be terrible shutter lag, nearly all photos are now grainy and blurry, and many of the pictures I take are never saved to memory.<p>It&#x27;s inexplicable. I love the phone&#x27;s display and battery life, and it&#x27;s still PERFECT for reading books and articles. But the camera and Touchwiz have just gotten crappier and crappier.<p>I&#x27;d love to upgrade to CyanogenMod, but unfortunately this is the international version of the Note II with a proprietary Exynos processor -- Samsung never released sufficient information for CyanogenMod to work properly. So I&#x27;m stuck with Touchwiz and a deliberately crippled phone.<p>For this reason alone, I think I&#x27;m switching back to Apple this fall. The iPhone camera is still best-in-class, and the camera app is SO fast to open and use. I just feel stupid paying a price premium for Apple when all Samsung needed to do was not cripple my camera.<p>Haha whoops. I started this post with the intention of praising the Note. My Note II WAS a perfect phablet for its era, but Samsung has deliberately or negligently crippled my once-beloved phone. Once the phablet iPhone is released and I find an iOS reader that compares to Android&#x27;s Moon+ Reader, I have strong incentive to switch back to Apple.",1409772890

Last year me and a friend started a service for crowd-sourcing fantasy football matchups (called Who Do I Start? for NFL Fantasy Football Leagues). The season went alright. I got the idea on opening kickoff last year, took a few days to think things through, then we hacked together a prototype and had it on the App Store for week 4 of the regular season. We ended the season with about 10 000 users, 25 000 matchups, and 270 000 votes on those matchups. Yesterday was the start of the 2014 season, and in the past 3 weeks we&#x27;ve doubled our userbase. We&#x27;ve currently got 1100 matchups created (since yesterday), and already have 90 000 votes. It&#x27;s looking like we&#x27;re going to far eclipse what we did last year.<p>We ran into a bunch of scalability issues yesterday, and have since moved to Linode. Things seem to be working <i>much</i> better.

I&#x27;ve seen enough questionable uses of LinkedBlockingQueue to last me a lifetime.  Inability to so much as &quot;close&quot; a BlockingQueue in the face of multiple concurrent consumers is an unbelievable cramp -- it won&#x27;t bother you until it does, but when it does, it&#x27;s just a bellyflop-onto-concrete sort of sensation.<p>B) I&#x27;m even more pessimistic than Pron&#x27;s sibling response about scalability of threads.  A minecraft server with a even a few dozen concurrent players is starting to feel the limitations of naively scheduled threads, as an anecdote.  Part of this comes down to the choices of concurrent data structures, how interaction with shared data strucutures is batch and the resolution of locks, the devil is in the details etc etc etc, but I&#x27;d venture that the abstractions with green threads and channels make good code a heck of a lot easier.<p>Truly trivial apps with one &quot;compute&quot; thread and one &quot;UI&quot; thread are unlikely to see serious performance gains.  Similarly applications that have workloads that are highly parallel (say, somewhere around $num_cpus threads which exchange information only once every few hundred millions of cycles -- spitballing a bit, but for context I think the Doug Lea talk I linked in earlier (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sq0MX3fHkro"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sq0MX3fHkro</a>) mentions thread unpark can take up to a million cycles in a worst-case scenario) are unlikely to see serious performance gains.  So there are situations where green threading can&#x27;t help you from a purely performance perspective, yes.  But in practice, it&#x27;s my observation that it&#x27;s startling how quickly &quot;simple&quot; apps end up doing enough concurrent UI or network operations that naive threading starts getting unpleasant.",1409771695

8264661,comment,8263537,8263537,4,0,bane,,,"Looks like a really minor refinement of the Note 3. That&#x27;s not a bad thing, I just ended up with a Note 3 and love it (beautiful screen, unbelievable battery life, fantastic speakerphone, impeccable hardware, etc.)<p>I have a flip cover for it that makes it look like a high-end paper notebook from a distance and it&#x27;s a bit narrower and much thinner than my moleskine notebooks, which is what it&#x27;s largely replaced. The pen works fantastic even if the included software is a little funky in some places. It&#x27;s very low latency compared to finger input and can even recognize the difference between the pen and your finger so you can grab the screen without writing on it. I can write on it about as fine as I can write in my moleskines. The case replaces the back panel so it doesn&#x27;t add any thickness to the device except for the front panel, which has a nifty window that just shows the time and lets you answer calls without opening it up all the way. It folds around the back so you can use the phone without it getting in the way.<p>I showed it to my parents, and my octogenarian Dad, who&#x27;s been struggling typing on his iphone (and hates hates hates it and has to use a stylus and reading glasses to use it at all), has already gone out and bought one and my mother is planning on upgrading from her flip phone to a Note very soon. Using it as a notepad is really natural for them, and after I showed them how to just email a pdf of their notes they were sold.<p>Battery life is absurd. It&#x27;s kind of strange what a transformative experience great battery life has on a phone. It turns your phone from an adversary into a companion. After heavy usage all day (multiple hours of phone calls and otherwise almost constantly doing something with it all day) it&#x27;s usually above 50% at the end of the day and still has 30-40% by the time I go to bed.<p>Amazingly, it fits pretty comfortably in my pocket. I don&#x27;t wear skinny jeans so that kind of thing is usually not a problem for me. But I do find myself walking around with my phone more often than I realized. Usually on a call or something.<p>The battery is replaceable/upgradeable and there&#x27;s an SD card slot so I can plop in another 64GB if I really need to. The camera is pretty good. I&#x27;m not in a habit of taking pictures with my phones, but the few I&#x27;ve taken were as good as my old point and shoot. I don&#x27;t like the camera software however, there&#x27;s some UI issues with it I think could be done much better.<p>And oh yeah, it has 3GB of RAM. It&#x27;s hard to explain what that means for multitasking, but I used to regularly have apps shutdown in the background when I was doing something else. Now I can play music, answer and email, browse for the answer I&#x27;m about to type and have navigation running in the background without worrying something is going to get killed.<p>My phone is <i>almost</i> as powerful as the desktop computer I recently replaced. Except it&#x27;s no in my pocket.<p>Issues: The Samsung TouchWiz I could live without, as I could with all the crapware installed by Verizon (there&#x27;s a couple useful things installed so it&#x27;s not a total loss). Some of the defaults are just plain stupid, like pushing home on the home screen to auto launch some kind of magazine app I don&#x27;t want to use. It took a little while to figure out how to kill that &quot;feature&quot;. I also wish the flip case had a lock position to use as a kickstand. This is something that Apple wouldn&#x27;t have gotten wrong. It took me a couple hours to reconfigure the default factory phone into something I can really use, but it wasn&#x27;t particularly painful. Performance is off the charts, GTA 3 plays like a dream on it for example as does Caustic (a CPU heavy soft synth).<p>The capacitive buttons also don&#x27;t light-up by default so you have to know they&#x27;re there to push them. Then they light up. It&#x27;s kind of stupid. They do provide a menu key on the Note 3, which I love. I don&#x27;t get the obsession with moving menus from the dedicated menu button up to some random location in every application&#x27;s gui. Fortunately, most apps observe the guidelines and remove the menu button in the gui and use the phone&#x27;s button instead. (yeah yeah, well designed apps shouldn&#x27;t have menus blah blah, well apps do have menus and they aren&#x27;t going anywhere and shuffling the icon around the screen is worse then putting it under a dedicated button IMHO).<p>I need more USB 3 cables. Every cable I have anywhere else is one of the old style USB 2 cables, which works fine with the phone. But being able to recharge it ultra quick with the 3 cable is really nice.<p>Unless Samsung really craps the phones up in the future, I&#x27;m pretty sure my next phone in a couple years will probably be another Note.",1409770914

Even for a tomato.<p>The proper way to water trees or grape vines is tens or hundreds of gallons at a time then let the soil dry down. Otherwise you don&#x27;t get the root development that takes up nutrients and anchors the plant. Trees that are watered shallowly for their whole lives often blow right over on maturity. And, in watering in California, Arizona and probably most places in the western US you need what is called a leaching fraction. That means you need to water well beyond the root zone to push out and avoid the accumulation of salts. It is far more energy efficient to pipe or flow the water to the plant than carry it. And... we are talking about a significant amount of water.<p>This is what I mean by scale. People have trouble conceiving it in agriculture for some reason. They tend to believe a few computer controlled hydro gardens can feed the world. Nope. You know all the countless green circles you see on the ground while flying across the country? That&#x27;s real food production in action and even with all that we may become strained. A change in global diet might help. Improved genetics might help. But farmers aren&#x27;t stupid. Over the course of generations they have achieved some degree of efficiency. Gadgets might help get a bit more but the easy gains have been largely worked out.",1403653825

Does your philosophy deny the benefits that come from the tendency towards competitive behaviour that confidence gives people?<p>> This is only a demoralizing belief if you&#x27;re arrogant enough to think that you&#x27;re better than everyone else. Real practitioners admit that they&#x27;re barely capable most of the time and accept that they have to work hard to achieve their goals.<p>I thought it was common wisdom was that it was demoralising for most to feel that you they are bad at something.<p>Your description of &quot;real practitioner&quot; as an exclusive category of &quot;realness&quot; with membership rules set by yourself that by a strange coincidence also contains yourself is really funny by the way.<p>In reality, there are good engineers that consider themselves bad [0], average engineers that are poor, bad engineers that consider themselves average, etc. There are people that strive harder the worse they feel, there are people that strive harder the more their ego is stroked. There are great engineers that think they&#x27;re barely capable of the work they do, and there are great engineers that think they are god&#x27;s gift to technology. There are people that are attracted to work in which they are out-of-their-depth, as well as people that are driven away by the fear of failure.<p>It&#x27;s really hard to say anything with certainty but I know I&#x27;ve met most of these people and I don&#x27;t feel there&#x27;s any piece of advice that works for everybody - my intuition was just that the guy at the top seemed like he needed his self-esteem raised not lowered to help with his learning. (For the record, I only responded to you directly because I felt you were contemptuous towards the arrogance of other engineers while also having decided you would be the sole objective judge of what it means to be a &quot;real practitioner.&quot;)<p>[0] There are engineers working in extremely competitive work environments that contain only the top-10% of their domain and they will often forget this when they evaluate themselves. Valuing your status locally is easy, globally it is hard! Best view for me has just been: I am good at learning, I like that I try hard, I have mixed abilities but as long as I&#x27;m able to positively contribute I do not need to worry.",1403653441

It&#x27;s all a bit frivolous.<p>By definition, the poor and middle classes don&#x27;t possess true wealth. Their value is their human capital and time, which they exchange for money. Even the &quot;working rich&quot; - doctors and lawyers - don&#x27;t routinely possess &quot;wealth&quot; in the traditional sense of the term.<p>Then we compare the $30,000 equity I possess to actual wealth... such as the land under a shopping mall.

Why would anyone be surprised that a significant portion of the population has zero wealth? Honestly I&#x27;m surprised it&#x27;s only 25% who have zero. How much &quot;wealth&quot; should a university student have? How about someone who&#x27;s been working for a few years? How about someone who&#x27;s been retired for twenty years and expects to die within the next ten?<p>Middle class people gradually build up a small stock of &quot;wealth&quot; (we used to call this &quot;savings&quot;) throughout their working careers. Then after retirement they gradually draw it down until they die.<p>So yes, it is not surprising that many people have zero or negative wealth.",1403653390

Hypothesizing that it&#x27;s just a social change related to shrinking households leads to some interesting questions about what that really means in practical terms:  Did the bottom 5% go from an average net worth of -$9K to -27K over the course of a decade because, on average, three individuals in the red would get together to form a combined household with pooled debts?  Did the 25th percentile go from an average of $10k to an average of $3k because of parents getting divorced and kids moving out en masse?  Meanwhile wealthy people&#x27;s family structures remain static.<p>I think the data you link and the data in the article are reconcilable.  Income and wealth are different things, after all.  Perhaps wealthier folks&#x27; net worth dropped less precipitously during the Great Recession because they experienced nothing worse than a drop in the valuation of their primary residence.  Meanwhile less wealthy folks suffered a greater loss because they were more likely to get foreclosed on, therefore suffering a loss of all the equity they had built up in their homes.

For some reason the full focus is always on direct force and how bad that is, externalities or indirect force caused by capital or property accumulation is played down - obviously because it doesn&#x27;t fit the interest of the pro-property crowd.<p>&quot;If a person is born without enough land or capital to be self-sufficient, and all the land and capital in the world at their time of birth was already used by others, then giving them enough land or capital to be self-sufficient would necessarily (assuming it wasn&#x27;t given voluntarily through charity) require direct force to take the land/capital of others to give to this person.&quot;<p>This is an unlikely hypothetical scenario and not reflected in todays society. This is another instance of a dishonest way to argue. You argue for private-property as it&#x27;s like in todays society where land is not scarce - in the sense of actual active usage. And your argument for this is in a hyphotetical scenario where all land is actually occupied.<p>Furthermore, in a proper anarchist, going with this scenario, a society where all land is actually being cultivated or in various types of use; I&#x27;m pretty sure people would not need to work, and as such need to own their own land, as in such a society work is what people would want to abandon. Abondonment of work would of course be impossible in a ancap society where the propertyless would need to work for the propertied.<p>Finally, your whole argument stems from the fact that you see private-property as some form of natural law where is not a privilege. This is just Orwellian, where owning more land than one can possibly, actively, use oneself is still regarded as a righteous possession rather than just privileged private-property upheld by some form of force. Private-property can&#x27;t be sustained without some form of force. Even if that&#x27;s for you ancaps is some kind of payed private militia or similar, it still needs to be upheld from people that would like to actually use the land for self-sufficiency. And no, to use the land by paying workers to use it for you is not using the land by oneself.",1403651161

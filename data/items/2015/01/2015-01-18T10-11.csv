That&#x27;s how modules work in JS. Having to &quot;return&quot; something at the end of a module is a requirement in Lua, too - again, it&#x27;s just how the module system works.<p>Anyway, I don&#x27;t know PERL, but knowing many other languages I find your claims suspicious. It reads as if you were a recent Java convert who tries to rationalize his decision to leave PERL or something like that.",1421578671

And the point is that using the old constructs this is exactly what you were able to do.<p>Java is not functional enough (or at least the way I code isn&#x27;t) that all the variables I need will be enclosed in the lambda.<p>In fact when you step into a lambda you retain the scope of the enclosing class (unlike an inner class), so for example when you call toString() you will be printing the toString() of the enclosing object.  For this reason it makes sense that in the debugger you should not be considered to have stepped into a new frame when you drop into a lambda.<p>Ultimately this is all about usability and in real life I have found it extremely frustrating that I can&#x27;t easily observe the values outside the lambda.",1421577309

8907192,comment,8904980,8907093,0,0,woodman,,,"It isn&#x27;t really complicated as all that, it helps to define terms.<p>Problem: Reduce terrorism to zero while maximizing individual freedom.  So we&#x27;d have to define &quot;terrorism&quot; and &quot;freedom&quot;.  That is going to be pretty difficult, as the the goal posts on terrorism have shifted from what was once an activity that fell within the spectrum of warfare, and therefor outside the realm on nonstate actors, to where it is at today - criminal activity that upsets people.  I have no doubt that the goal posts will continue to shift.  Freedom is even more difficult to define, as many feel they are entitled to freedoms that necessitate the reduction of other&#x27;s freedoms: freedom from hunger, sickness, etc.  So you aren&#x27;t likely to find consensus on a definition for that.<p>It isn&#x27;t a difficult problem, it is an impossible problem, because it isn&#x27;t even possible to define the terms.  That is, unless you accept the idea of universal preference, then it becomes pretty simple - as you&#x27;d be able to fix both variables.

You need alternatives. Would I suggest a hamburger menu for a menu with 3 items? No of course not. But if you have an app with 10 core menu items, there&#x27;s not many alternatives. You could try to force and cram that into a navigation bar with 3 item-categories, which open pages with deeper navigation trees, and that&#x27;d tick all the &#x27;why-not&#x27; boxes of the menubar the article mentions (like unnecessary clicking, users that can&#x27;t find their information, don&#x27;t know where they can go or where they are on the page etc etc).<p>Fact is that a lot of users are indeed familiar with hamburger menus these days and they&#x27;re becoming a type of standard just like a back arrow is universally understood, and find their way outside of apps, too. (like the Chrome browser which I&#x27;m typing this on right now.)<p>Combine that with the fact the top navigation bar&#x27;s title telling you where you are, and a non-crammed side menu showing you exactly where you can go, it&#x27;s certainly a decent solution for many apps.",1421577221

8907172,comment,8906700,8907086,0,0,RockyMcNuts,,,"You can&#x27;t just assume a free market discounting future events. The SNB was pegging the currency at an artificial fixed rate v. the euro. Which is of course the opposite of a free market and preventing the price from reflecting the expectation of the market.<p>So, traders start to anticipate a revaluation and buy francs. The SNB has to print and sell francs to maintain the peg. The SNB becomes aware that it is in an untenable position and will have to print a multiple of Swiss GDP worth of francs and effectively prop up the euro.<p>They have nothing but bad choices: buy an unlimited quantity of euros right in the face of QE; re-peg at a higher rate or against a different currency, but have an arrow painted on their back that the new rate may not hold; or float.<p>So, they float. Now the traders at retail brokers like FXCM who got hurt weren&#x27;t necessarily net short on balance. The problem is FXCM allowed 50-1 leverage. Say you have accounts with $40m of equity taking $2b of short exposure to swiss franc, and foolishly going long a high yielding currency to pick up carry. And you could have 10x or any number of accounts correctly anticipating and going long francs.<p>Now, the franc jumps 20% without any opportunity to cover shorts. On 50-1 leverage the $40m equity accounts with $2b exposure $400m, or 10x their equity. A client has a $10k brokerage account and loses $100k, the broker can&#x27;t recover that from them in most cases. The people who anticipated and were on the right side of the trade make out like bandits. But the broker still has to cover for all the losers so they are SOL.<p>TL; DR - Going from an artificial peg to a free market rate, you can&#x27;t say that the artificial peg discounted all future events. Obviously the rate needed to adjust to do so. And even if a lot of traders correctly anticipated, FXCM foolishly put themselves in the position of having to cover those who didn&#x27;t.",1421575864

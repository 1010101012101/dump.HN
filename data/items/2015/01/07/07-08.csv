Try a few, some are awesome, some are bad, depends on the guests. Smaller houses are more casual, but bigger houses often host events or team up to travel together to nearby events. Plan to stay around 2 months to really get the feel of how things work. Check if Stanford or some other university hosts a startup camp of some sort. I feel like you should stay away from actual hackathons in the valley, but I may be wrong. Also the winter is warm in San Francisco, so you get to move around easily and it attracts more traveling hackers from around the world.

This is often quite challenging since outages sometimes might span low / peak traffic periods or ramp-up/down periods.<p>3) Finally, it can be hard to pinpoint the actual start / end of the event (the identify the time samples you want to consider in your measurement for the outage cost).  Particularly the end, since there&#x27;s often some pressure for queued operations (by software or by your users who are itching to complete what they were trying to do) that may make your samples fluctuate.  That backfill pressure can be substantial and is important to not ignore in your measurement of the actual cost of the issue.  Say you&#x27;re a retail site - if you have a 15 minute period of 50% order drop but the first 5 minutes where service is restored, the total order rate was 50% above projections.  Do you count that as 15 minutes of 50% order drop, or 10 minutes of 50% order drop?  Both are legitimate but it&#x27;s important to know what metric you&#x27;re measuring yourself against so you&#x27;re as correct / honest as you can be.",1420616937

Even in this thread I see stuff in the US about being charged for using a card to pay.

They simply don&#x27;t, and if you teach math class mistakenly assuming they do, 90% tunes out.<p>If you can show them how those abstract patterns reflect things in nature, and how those symbolic manipulations represent ideas and algorithms and systems, and can explain complicated things, that&#x27;s something else.<p>e.g. You don&#x27;t need computer graphics to teach linear algebra, but how many people who &#x27;know&#x27; matrix algebra know that the columns of a matrix are the basis vectors for the principal axes, and that matrix multiplication is the (affine) transform tool from photoshop?<p>I would also suggest that if you want to get kids interested in trigonometry and you fail to mention that every single thing in a 3D video game is made out of triangles, you are a bad teacher and you should feel bad.",1420614980

I think this might have been a more interesting and simple gift, wish it came out in time. I did get to play with the NUC because I wanted to have it all configured and ready to use. It was interesting to see how they got all of the components packed in and I was impressed by the performance. Main issue I had was graphics support, because I wanted to put Elementary OS on it to see if he&#x27;d be interested in trying out Linux. Ended up going with the latest Ubuntu instead (Elementary OS Luna is built on Ubuntu 12.04) which worked fine.<p>My Dad had gone through a couple of those Shuttle &quot;Mini&quot; computers (the motherboards were Flex-ATX, slightly bigger than Mini-ITX and obviously needed to be smaller than micro-ATX), so I thought the NUC (between Nano-ITX and Pico-ITX [1]) might appeal to him. They both died and he&#x27;s currently using a standard desktop. I believe one or both of his Shuttle&#x27;s died due to a PSU failure, so it&#x27;s nice to have the external power brick on the NUC.<p>He and my Mom had previously been using a Windows Media Center desktop with a tuner card and Comcast cable, but they&#x27;re using DirecTV boxes on all the TVs now so not much need for a HTPC. He said he was thinking about trying to use the NUC with Windows 8 and a touch screen somehow...Not really sure how he can accomplish that. Besides introducing him to Linux, I was thinking he could use it on his TV as just an alternate computer and wanted to show him how to use Synergy to control it with his desktop keyboard/mouse. He&#x27;s currently switching his TV between the DirecTV box and his desktop as a second display.<p>At the very least it&#x27;s a backup, and he could potentially take it on trips as a more powerful alternative to a laptop. There&#x27;s just so many different options for computing these days.

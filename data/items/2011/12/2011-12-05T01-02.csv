3312620,comment,3311112,3312584,10,0,philwelch,,,"> It's pretty clear, given that, that your picks for ""scary label"" are nonsense and evidence failed comprehension, or refused comprehension. Witches are not on the upside of a power gap, seeking to continue their witchy abuses while avoiding the label ""witch"". Sexists are.<p>""My witch-hunt is just, because in my case, the witches actually exist and really do secretly control society.""<p>The real problem is that complicated issues like this turn into exercises of identity. It happens on both sides; your side is filled with self-identified feminists immediately siding with anyone who makes an accusation of sexism. Straightforward statements pointing out that no sexism has actually been demonstrated or that it's rhetorically unfair to shield oneself from criticism for being emotional are themselves taken as expressions of sexism, in much the same way that anyone calling for moderation or pacifism was, in the Cold War, accused of being in cahoots with the communists.<p>The result of this is that you alienate thoughtful people. On several occasions I've spoken out on HN against genuine sexism and in favor of genuine feminist interests. But I'm not interested in getting caught up in a tribalist ideological groupthink, and I have thoughtful criticism for dishonest rhetoric, and so you read me as ""sexist"", in the classic ""you're either with us or against us"" mindset (rephrased by contemporary leftists as ""you're either part of the solution or part of the problem"").",1323050321

However, if you populate the second set of DIMMs on an Intel platform you'll get slower memory performance.  So your 1333 MHz memory will end up being 1066, or your 1066 will be 800.  You'll notice this resultant speed of course, but you won't realize it's bad until you have a second server with a slightly different memory configuration.<p>Additionally, there are situations where a hex core will have reduced throughput over a similarly clocked quad core, particularly if it's IO constrained for either memory (see #1) or disk.<p>If your check this on your servers and swap out the memory, and application speeds up because of this tidbit, please let me know :) I think this qualifies as non-intuitive because unless you're a sysadmin  you wouldn't think to optimize this part of your hardware in your stack.",1323050249

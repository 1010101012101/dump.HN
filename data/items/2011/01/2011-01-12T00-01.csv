(Unless of course it's a listener with whom you've already had this conversation.)
2) If you stop to define them, the whole conversation gets derailed to argue about the definitions.<p>That is why people say these words ""have nearly no meaning at all"".  Does that help your confusion?<p>So, if you want to communicate about type systems, your communication will contain less misunderstanding if you simply omit the words ""strong"" and ""weak"".  And for myself (although this may be too snotty a move for you), if someone else uses them, I refuse to hear them, and ask them to use different words and define those words.<p>My experience, in practice, is that when people say ""strong"" and ""weak"", I do indeed find that as cdsmith says, ""strong"" mostly corresponds to ""it makes me comfortable"".",1294793236

I can express on it all of my emotions, but still secrets are kept. I can write on it all of my thoughts.<p>It is, I must say, because of the journals I have kept that I have overcome so much adversity and it is journals which help me to push myslef further, and become better, every singl day. More often I do not know it, but the simple act of sitting in front of my computer and writing my thoughts down helps tremendously towards taking me further to what I want.<p>The problem I think is that, all the journals I have written, perhaps five or six, are now forever gone and deleted.<p>The strange thing is that in every entry, though I primarely write about myself and for myself, I aboslutley feel like there is an audience out there. Yet the more stranger thing is that, regardless of the imaginary glory of the moment, a diary to me is a personal thing, for my eyes only. It is something which maks sense to me only, and sometimes, to the moment that I wrote it alone.<p>Diaries can be dangerous. They are a perfect tool for narrowing your thinking. What you want is repeated over and ver, to the point that you do not feel that you want it anymore but are just saying so.<p>But I love writing journal entires. Despite the many journals that were deleted by whim and others that were deleted not by choice, I love writing them.<p>A journal makes me mak sense of what is was ad could be, and tthat, abouve my childrens fascination, is why I write them, despite the fact that they end up deleted and disapeared forever.",1294792818

MPEG-LA has been threatening about Vorbis for the last 11 years and nothing has happened so far, same thing with theora. The last thing MPGEG-LA want is to reveal what patents exactly are being used by WebM (if any), they'd rather spread FUD and make companies pay for licenses out of fear like they always have as the patent troll that they are.

Thankyou.<p>Secondly this post by 37 signals is inspired by RTFH but the headline is ""There is no place for just shitting all over other people's work"" - and that's a true statement.<p>This is something that is particularly rife in amongst programmers: they point at each other and say ""what? you don't use X and do X? then you are a shit programmer"". Life is about getting things done and getting things done necessitates compromise.<p>You should see how shit the videos I just made for my product are. They're totally shit, but it's the best I could do and I wanted to put something up there. I didn't have the money to pay a professional or the time to learn to do it better - there you go. Whilst I was doing it my own internal monologue kept saying ""This looks like the investor pitch video for Prestige Worldwide"" (if you don't get that reference, it's from the film ""Step Brothers"").<p>If someone posted my videos on a website called ""makeyourfuckingvideosgood.tumblr.com"" I wouldn't necessarily be offended because it would generate traffic to my site and I know my limitations and have no sense of pride in what I've created, but that doesn't make it right for someone to wantonly create zero value assertions about the quality of others' work (let me say, though, that I would say that humour adds value so Maddox's ""I am better than your kids"" is exempt).<p>Now lastly, I find it somewhat ironic that 37signals have posted all this shitting on the person's work who writes RTFH. Perhaps they could have included some constructive criticism on how to improve their writing, or posted alternative examples of satire they enjoy more.<p>Perhaps the most appropriate response would have been to create readsomefuckingsatire.tumblr.com and put that site on it.<p>As professionals we should all be continually learning and improving, and we should never disparage someone who has not learned or improved as much as us in a given field because, as the OP points out:<p><i>they're making something and that's awesome.</i><p>That's the key point I took out of this post, and it's an attitude I'm going to work harder to cultivate in my own life.",1294792682

It is a mistake to believe that one needs an entirely newly designed hardware chip to handle the WebM standard. Those hardware accelerators are not pure hardware. They are like little computers, with their own processors, and their own instruction memories, and their own software (or firmware). The processors are designed to efficiently compute the most commonly used math operations of the standard (which are usually Fourier transforms, matrix operations, etc.). The firmware causes the processor to apply the mathematical operations properly to the data to decode the video.<p>The thing is that all of those video standards use more or less the same basic math operations, just in a different way. This means that a WebM hardware accelerator would look very similar hardware wise to a h.264 one but would have different firmware.<p>In practice, I am sure that the hardware companies will make one hardware accelerator that can handle both h.264 and webm through different firmware programs. So you wont need much additional silicon or power to handle WebM. It might cost more, if the hardware companies decide to charge extra for WebM support, but that surcharge will not be much, because (i) they do not need to pay license fees, and (ii) there is a lot of competition in that field.",1294791663

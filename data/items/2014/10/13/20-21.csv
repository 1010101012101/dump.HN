By the mid 2000&#x27;s most companies were knee deep in trying to build out their hybrid lines and grab what was left of the market Toyota had already been dominating for years with the Prius.<p>The Aztec looked stuck between a company trying to make a full sized SUV and a economy sized crossover for the masses.

It&#x27;s not all that different from a modern Suburu Outback, Honda CR-V, Kia Sorento, Hyundai Tuscon, etc.  It&#x27;s pretty much your standard-issue &quot;crossover&quot; vehicle (i.e. 21st-century station wagon).<p>Granted, I think there&#x27;s nothing particular attractive about &quot;crossover&quot; vehicles today, either.

There are better criteria: I like Future II and composites in German, in English almost every noun can be turned into a verb, French is full of nice sounding idioms. Some languages lack future or conjunctive at all, in others the verb conjugates with the speaker&#x27;s confidence. The richness of colors is another topic. The list is endless, all the thousands of natural languages have a different expressiveness. The trends towards English kills a lot of the total human cultural expressiveness.

I&#x27;d argue quite the opposite having done this in a large corporation with pretty decent success.<p>to be successful, it requires that your monitoring isn&#x27;t noisy; most issues are repaired in an automated way; then when you get a &quot;page&quot; it is something that someone deeply familiar with the code / service is the best person to react to it. it will drive down the MTTR. and it typically gets the root cause fixed sooner in the code. these folks need to be engineers, but they don&#x27;t all need to be just the devs, since internet scale services just are noisy and you need to have some randomization buffer. but those engineers need to be dedicated to the service and not a central org, where they aren&#x27;t going to know how to look at logs, have depth on the intra-service interactions, the latest changes, etc. to me, this is also the best definition of &quot;devops&quot;.",1413233170

It sounds like an interesting study, I can&#x27;t wait to read the results. My view of weight loss is simple: eat less. I eat anything I want, don&#x27;t eat until noon each day, do essentially no cardio, and lift weights for less than 30 minutes 2-3 times/week. My weight loss is fairly constant at 1 lb/week. My progress: <a href=""https://trendweight.com/u/2c41346d238544/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://trendweight.com/u/2c41346d238544/</a> (note: chart starts at 210 which is 15 lbs into my weight loss when I started tracking).<p>I say all this only to point out that losing weight can happen regardless of approach. One&#x27;s chosen approach to losing weight may or may not be suitable to one&#x27;s personal lifestyle or dietary preferences, but ANY approach can work because the math is infallible: calories in < calories out = weight loss. So, just eat less than what your body needs to burn on a daily/weekly basis.<p>If low-carb makes you happy because you can indulge in 1 lb block of cheese, then by all means go for it. Yes, things like ketogenic diets have other physical effects on our physiology but I prefer a simpler point of view: there are only so many blocks of cheese one can eat before you get tired of it. If you&#x27;re restricting your carbs, you simply ultimately eat less. The restriction of choice is the root cause, for example.<p>So: for everyone trying to thinking about losing weight, find a diet you buy in to and go for it. Personally, I found the approach of analytically tracking my food and weight and permitting myself to eat ANYTHING I want liberating. I know precisely what I eat every day, and I like that. It fits my personality and liberates me from the nagging choice of where/what to eat. I have my favorite foods and I eat them, and have found ways to do so so that I hit my daily protein target and stay at or under my daily calorie target. The down side to this approach is I don&#x27;t eat out much because it&#x27;s hard to know what&#x27;s in that food (this isn&#x27;t a downside for ME, though).<p>Don&#x27;t buy into the need to do a specific diet, all diets can work if you find one that you are in tune with, because ultimately, it&#x27;s all about finding the optimum path to eat less than what your body needs without sacrificing whatever mental and physical joy you get from food.",1413232964

This is effectively what UNIX does: there is one IPC object--a string of bytes.In UNIX-2 I could have more types of objects, but the fact that they&#x27;re defined independent of the programs means that I will still be &quot;hoping the receiving process understands&quot; when I give it data from arbitrary programs...My point is, trying to enforce OOP on IPC will take away universal program composibility, which is the killer (if not defining) feature of UNIX.<p>Not necessarily.

Instead, can we find useful principles to steer us away from the two bogeymen (hack-it-till-it-works vs useless-ivory-tower-wankery)? Some ideas:<p><i>The real world exists.</i> Successful solutions usually come from actually understanding the problem and all it&#x27;s constraints. Solutions that are dismissed as overly academic tend to fall afoul of solving just the immediate problem and ignoring eg compatibility, switching costs, accessibility to beginners. Similarly, the linux community spent a long time burying it&#x27;s head in the sane w.r.t. usability and appearance. Sure, people <i>shouldn&#x27;t</i> care how pretty your UI is. But they do and you can&#x27;t change that by burying your head in the sand.<p><i>Everything has a cost.</i> The benefits of your new solution and the switching cost have to outweigh the pain of the old solution by a large margin. The original &#x27;worse is better&#x27; was really an observation that simple solutions that do half the job are often cheaper than a hugely complicated solution that can do everything. If you spend every day coming up with better ways to make widgets, it&#x27;s easy to believe that everyone wants to have as much widget-customising power as possible and is willing to invest time in learning to get that power.

A few examples.<p>- C&#x27;s &quot;the language has no idea how big an array is&quot; problem. Result: decades of buffer overflows, and a whole industry finding them, patching them, and exploiting them.<p>- Delayed ACKs in TCP. OK idea, but the fixed timer was based on human typing speed, copied from X.25 accumulation timers. Result: elaborate workarounds, network stalls.<p>- C&#x27;s &quot;#include&quot; textual approach to definition inclusion. Result: huge, slow builds, hacks like &quot;precompiled headers&quot;.<p>- HTML float/clear as a layout mechanism. Result: Javascript libraries for layout on top of the browser&#x27;s layout engine. Absolute positioning errors. Text on top of text or offscreen.<p>- The UNIX protection model, where the finest-grain entity is the user. Any program can do anything the user can do, and hostile programs do. Result: the virus and anti-virus industries.<p>- Makefiles. Using dependency relationships was a good idea. Having them be independent of the actual dependencies in the program wasn&#x27;t. Result: &quot;make depend&quot;,\n&quot;./configure&quot;, and other painful hacks.<p>- Peripheral-side control of DMA.  Before PCs, IBM mainframes had &quot;channels&quot;, which effectively had an MMU between device and memory, so that devices couldn&#x27;t blither all over memory.  Channels also provided a uniform interface for all devices. IBM PCs, like many minicomputers, originally had memory and devices on the same bus. This reduced transistor count back when it mattered. But it meant that devices could write all over memory, and devices and drivers had be trusted.  Three decades later, when transistor counts don&#x27;t matter, we still have that basic architecture. Result: drivers still crashing operating systems, many drivers still in kernel, devices able to inject malware into systems.<p>- Poor interprocess communication in operating systems. What&#x27;s usually needed is a subroutine call. What the OS usually gives you is an I/O operation.  QNX gets this right. IPC was a retrofit in the UNIX/Linux world, and still isn&#x27;t very good.  Fast IPC requires very tight coordination between scheduling and IPC, or each IPC operation puts somebody at the end of the line for CPU time. Result: elaborate, slow IPC systems built on top of sockets, pipes, channels, shared memory, etc. Programs too monolithic.<p>- Related to this, poor support for &quot;big objects&quot;. A &quot;big object&quot; is something which can be called and provides various functions, but has an arms-length relationship with the caller and needs some protection from it.  Examples are databases, network stacks, and other services. We don&#x27;t even have a standard term for this. Special-purpose approaches include talking to the big object over a socket (databases), putting the big object in the kernel (network stacks), and trying to use DLL/shared object mechanisms in the same or partially shared address space.  General purpose approaches include CORBA, OLE, Google protocol buffers and, perhaps, REST/JSON.  Result: ad-hoc hacks for each shared object.",1413231456

The real meaning of &quot;worse is better&quot; is of course subjective and complicated. And as has been pointed out in these comments, &quot;worse is better&quot; is not about creating &quot;worse&quot; software and then marketing it as &quot;better&quot;. It is something much more philosophical.<p>In my eyes &quot;worse is better&quot; is about the mindset of approaching a task. It is about diving right in and learning through production - without being paralysed by the idea of introducing hacks or ugly design. It is the idea that, for the moment, there isn&#x27;t a need to be worried about covering every edge case or possible failure option. It persuades you to focus on something simple and easy to explain, with a single purpose or intent. It is better to produce something (anything) and see where it takes you.<p>It also says how important it is to embrace contribution and collaboration. How important it is to, after some threshold, release yourself from feelings of ownership.<p>But if I had to nail down exactly why I believe &quot;worse&quot; is so successful (&quot;better&quot;) it is because those that create &quot;worse&quot; software don&#x27;t focus on the software - they focus on the idea. From that the software is painfully drawn. The software might suck, but I believe ideas are better. They are more persistant, easily explored, dynamic, and shareable than software. Ideas that are good, simple, and easily taught are far more important than well designed software. That is why they survive.<p>There are lots of programmers and hackers who don&#x27;t believe in &quot;worse is better&quot;. Sometimes you seen them on HN with a fantastic new programming language (or something) they have designed and built in isolation - perfect in every aspect (at least to them). Nothing quite hurts like their confusion when interest dwindles and their software is forgotten. All they had seen on HN were &quot;worse&quot; links every day, and after years they had provided &quot;better&quot; -  to them it is criminal that it hasn&#x27;t been picked and gained momentum.<p>Worse is better is not going away, and I think you can either engage yourself in it as a philosophy, or struggle.",1413231327

Our team is having more problems with this issue than anything else. However, there are two points which seem to contradict:<p><pre><code>  - Pages should be [...] actionable\n  - Symptoms should be monitored, not causes\n</code></pre>\nThe problem is that can&#x27;t act on symptoms, only research them and then act on the causes. If you get an alert that says the DB is down, that&#x27;s an actionable page - start the DB back up. Whereas, being paged that the connections to the DB are failing is far less actionable - you have to spend precious downtime researching the actual cause first. It could be the network, it could be an intermediary proxy, or it could be the DB itself.<p>Now granted, if you&#x27;re only catching causes, there is the possibility you might miss something with your monitoring, and if you double up on your monitoring (that is, checking symptoms as well as causes), you could get noise. That said, most monitoring solutions (such as Nagios) include dependency chains, so you get alerted on the cause, and the symptom is silenced while the cause is in an error condition. And if you missed a cause, you still get the symptom alert and can fill your monitoring gaps from there.<p>Leave your research for the RCA and following development to prevent future downtime. When stuff is down, a SA&#x27;s job is to get it back up.",1413231250

Imposing structure and types on IPC would make it very difficult to compose separate programs.<p>Suppose I created UNIX-2, where the only difference between UNIX and UNIX-2 in principle is the fact that UNIX-2 programs all pipe serialized Objects to and from each other, instead of byte streams.<p>Now, the ls program obviously outputs more information than just a list of strings--it also outputs types of files, permissions, owners, inode numbers, sizes, timestamps, etc.  I might be inclined to have ls output an lsOutputObject (derived from Object) that encapsulated all this information.<p>Suppose I wanted to pipe the output of ls into wc.  How does wc handle an lsOutputObject?  Either wc is programmed to know how to handle lsOutputObject, or it is not.  Since we want an object-oriented environment, we&#x27;ll assume the former case, so wc can call the appropriate object-specific methods and access the appropriate object-specific fields.  But, now wc is tightly coupled to ls.<p>This problem generalizes.  For a given program P in a set of N programs, wc will need to know how to access P&#x27;s output-object-specific fields and methods.  So, wc needs O(N) different subroutines to interact with the N other programs.  This does not scale--each additional program I add to UNIX-2 will require me to write O(N) additional IPC handlers--one for each program.<p>The only way to avoid this IPC-handler-explosion in the design is to define the set of IPC objects <i>a priori</i> and mandate all programs know how to handle them.  Then, there are O(1) IPC handlers per program, and adding a new program does not require me to couple its implementation to any other programs.  This is effectively what UNIX does: there is one IPC object--a string of bytes.  In UNIX-2 I could have more types of objects, but the fact that they&#x27;re defined independent of the programs means that I will still be &quot;hoping the receiving process understands&quot; when I give it data from arbitrary programs.<p>Suppose I relax this <i>a priori</i> object mandate above to allow programs to extend the base IPC object types.  But then, programs that do so will only compose with programs that implement IPC handlers for their extended object types.  In this scenario, I can expect there to be disjoint sets of programs that compose with one another, but not with others.  This is effectively what happens in SOA/microservice architectures: you get a set of programs that are composible only with programs that speak their (arbitrarily-structured) messages (the set of which is much smaller than the global set of SOA/microservice programs).<p>My point is, trying to enforce OOP on IPC will take away universal program composibility, which is the killer (if not defining) feature of UNIX.",1413231237

It worked, and there were already some predefined unit files from systemd-shim and various system packages. Performance was good.

We&#x27;ve been saying for years not to run Bittorrent over Tor, because the Tor network can&#x27;t handle the load; perhaps these attacks will convince more people to listen.

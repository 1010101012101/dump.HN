Step one would be banding together, not just with a centralized defensive patent portfolio, but with a centralized legal defense fund.  As for the NPEs, patent the business method of patent trolling (I think somebody already did this, so just keep applying until you get another patent for the same thing), then sue them for violating it.  After they're convicted by the central court of patent trolling, of course.<p>Astounding how the insight of law and centralized police, in just a slightly different domain, is so counterintuitive that companies still farm the lands as individuals, prey to whatever bandits stalk their way.",1304196921

So whats safe to me might not be safe to a cop. btw I'm 37 and have NEVER had an ""at fault accident"" so obviously I'm a safe driver. and what makes it not a safe time to go over the prima facia? 1 car in 100 ft of you? 2 cars in 50 ft? me going by a car in another lane thats going the prima facia limit??? So what this does is give the police to make things up as they go and being a law abiding citizen I get screwed. This is a PERFECT example of why law needs to be black and white.

Click the button and get a download. But do most people know how to take a download and put it on their e-reader? Are you sure you want no DRM at all?

37signals getting real is a book I hold close and dear and they recommend to get out a buzz page to collect contacts.  So I built a simple one with a few features:<p>- Linked up to fb instead of asking for emails for social proofing and its a lot easier to like something than give up your email address.<p>- Showed my friends screenshots to get quotes, linked to their twitter accounts to give credibility<p>- Since its not released it hasnt been featured in any outlets, I did however submit it to some of the leading link dumps and put their logos in there.  Even though being seen on digg isnt a big deal, the logos add credibility<p>- Offered incentives that will be followed up on: early adopter badges and early invites.<p>What Id like from you guys:
1. Like it if you like coffee.  Id be smitten.<p>2. What would you do to make a more efficient and effective buzz page to collect user bases?  What pearls of wisdom do you have to market and grow a new web app/startup?<p>3. If you are a coffee drinker, how do you think technology can be used to make your coffee experience better?

Bitcoin has through technical means controlled the supply part of the equation, but how can it control demand? So fluctuations in demand will cause changes. In the growth period, Bitcoin <i>can't</i> be stable, and it would be impossible for any currency to do so without extremely precise statistics on how a currency was being used and control over inflation (so you could, say, adjust supply exactly to match fluctuations in demand).<p>In the long run, most of the obvious equilibriums for Bitcoin are very far away from whatever it's currently trading at. If Bitcoin fails and becomes playmoney, then it's overpriced by hundreds of times; if it succeeds and replaces any sovereign country's currency, then it's undervalued by hundreds or thousands or millions of times. So in the long run, you must expect it to not be 'stable', but to change drastically - in some direction.<p>(If this isn't convincing, try applying the double reversal test Nick Bostrom devised for combating the status quo bias (<a href=""http://www.nickbostrom.com/ethics/statusquo.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nickbostrom.com/ethics/statusquo.pdf</a>) and anchoring (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchoring"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchoring</a>). Suppose that Bitcoin were at $2 rather than $4. Would you be saying 'obviously the right price for Bitcoin is $4, so I should buy some'? I doubt it. )<p>When Bitcoin is supposed to be stable is when demand for it is not varying; supply will be stable by the Bitcoin architecture, and hence, the overall equation wouldn't change in that situation. This differs from fiat currency in that you are only vulnerable to changes in the demand part of the equation - there is no Fed or other cabal that can hurt you by manipulating the supply part of the equation.",1304194828

I figure that this video and transcript must have some deeper meaning than what I'm grokking from it as it is currently the top story with a whopping ~500 points.<p>To my knowledge, cultural hierarchy is very standard within pretty much all companies regardless of size.  Not everyone gets a company car, their own office, the same health benefits, or if you are privileged enough to work at a company that provides them, the same gourmet lunch as has been stated elsewhere in these comments.  Furthermore, the existence of sub-hierarchy (contract and temporary) workers is very common in larger companies.  To my understanding, these temp and contract workers usually enjoy few if any benefits provided by the company as they are rarely actually employed by the company they are working for but rather an agency.<p>In addition to this, it is pretty standard procedure to ban all unauthorized taping on company campuses.  If anything, to my uninformed mind the fact that an employee got as far as actually taking unauthorized video footage is if anything a credit to Google's openness (or whatever you want to call it).<p>So, I guess my question is: Where is the interesting aspect of this?  Is the popularity of this really just due to the ""divulging"" that Google employs workers that aren't provided the same benefits as some of its other workers? Is it the existence of a ""class system"" in Google to show worker's authority/hierarchy level? If it is one of these reasons, there must be something else I'm missing as without having seen this story I would have just assumed that these things existed at Google.<p>I ask this as a sincere question as obviously this has gained the attention of a large portion of this community which I hold as very intelligent.

For me, its enough that I witnessed it.<p>Having said that, I obviously simplified the story and I have a pretty good theory of how he came up with the solution (since I now know the guy a lot better). I actually think he has a very very slight case of autism (never diagnosed, but over the years, there have been some hints that it may be the case). I of course don't believe that a woman actually told him the solution, I think the autism is what helped him come up with it (since properly autistic people are able to do some amazing things) and the drug made him trip out and believe a woman spoke to him.<p>As for not believing that somebody could do things on Salvia, I disagree. Normally I don't like to admit to drug use on the internet (since its easy to figure out who I am), but what the hell. Maybe I'll come to regret it later... While I haven't taken any in a few years, I have taken Salvia many times over the past ten-ish years (and I took it that night with my friend too). I have taken it in the middle of the day, in the sun. I have taken it at night, in a dark room. I have taken it at a party (despite people saying its not a party drug). Each time the experience was very very different. It depends on your surroundings and on your mood. Yes, salvia is extremely intense and gives a very disconnected experience, but I think the actual extent depends on the factors I mentioned above. For example, every time I took it at night, it was a very weird and ""heavy"" experience, but when I took it in the sun, it was a bright and happy (almost mdma-like) experience.<p>I don't know if you get this on Salvia, but most people I have spoken to about it have said they experienced something similar. When on Salvia, theres this feeling of ""pressure"" pulling you into the experience (often its a feeling of something pushing or pulling you some direction, perhaps spinning around, falling or weightlessness). I've got this every time (that I remember, there may have been times when I didn't that I don't remember). Every time I've tried to resist it and go against it, I broke out in heavy sweats. When we did the programming problem, it took a LOT of effort to resist it to write in the notepad. After a few minutes, I gave in and forgot about the notepad (skin soaked with sweat). I guess my friend was able to resist it more than I was. But. honestly, I don't remember the exact details, nor do I remember anything about the trip I had or what I wrote in my own notepad, since my friends was much more interesting and this happened maybe five or six years ago.<p>My point is that it is hard to resist it, but its not impossible (at least, for a while) and while resisting it, you can be tripping and still do things (well, kind of). But, at the end of the day, if you don't believe me, thats fine. Maybe you can try it for yourself? Just be aware that (in my experience) there will be an intense ""pressure"" pulling you away from what you're trying to do and you may have to try pretty hard to resist it.",1304194424

Law HAS to be black and white! otherwise what good is it? for instance, lets take something simple like traffic law in CA. The written law states that on a 2 lane divided highway the max speed limit is 55 MPH and on a 4 lane divided highway its 65 MPH (although counties can bump it up to 70 if they desire). So, most streets in decent sized towns you can legally drive 65 on if it is safe to do so. This is where the prima facia speed laws come into effect (like when the limit is set at 40 MPH in town). how they come up with this is the ""85 percentile"". 100 cars have their speed measured and what ever the avg speed of the 85% are going, thats what the limit is set at. So back to the written law, it stats that you can go faster than the posted limit if it is safe to do so. HERE'S WHERE THE BULLSH*T COMES INTO PLAY.... and whats",1304194155

Examples:<p>1. Quicksilver <-> Spotlight. Spotlight is terrible. Everyone I know who used quicksilver just uses nothing now. They certainly haven't ""switched"" to Spotlight because spotlight doesn't do anything half as well as quicksilver did, not even launching apps for god's sake.<p>2. Kaleidoscope <-> Dashboard. Another disaster. Dashboard seems to exist solely to be accidentally opened, or I guess for some people it serves as their dedicated weather ""space"". Apple does not hype up widgets at all anymore.<p>3. Safari RSS. Does anyone actually use this? Or how about Mail.app RSS?

You seem to infer some other right that doesn't exist - the right to never be fired.  But a law forcing such a measure would decrease the freedom of individuals to freely enter into and terminate contracts with each other.  If both parties enter into a contract by their own free will, why should there be some law restricting their freedom to structure that contract in a manner that both parties agree to?",1304193798

The teacher would every week update us with the latest stock information, and based on that we'd have to make decisions. The person with the biggest amount of money at the end of the year won.<p>So I picked stock of a company which was basically bankrupt already, but was still on the stock market (why I don't know, I'm not an expert.) I think the stock was £0.02. So I waited a few weeks, and it happened to be at £0.05. I sold everything, didn't do anything for the rest of the year, and won.

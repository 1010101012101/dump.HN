It is way more expensive than just buying our own replicating storage and hosting one off site.  25TB in s3 is is $43,000/year.  It cost us $90,000 to get 4 falconstore ga700s and (3x40TB) of storage.  This gives us 2 devices on site in a HA setup with 40TB of storage, and 2 offsite devices in different datacenters with 40TB of storage each.  We end up with way more features than amazon's offering, better performance, and the 40TB of storage we have costs less than 3 years of having 25TB of storage at amazon, where we'd still need to be paying for the local storage as well.",1327503464

New screens began arriving at the [Chinese] plant near midnight. A foreman immediately roused 8,000 workers inside the companys dormitories, according to the executive. Each employee was given a biscuit and a cup of tea, guided to a workstation and within half an hour started a 12-hour shift fitting glass screens into beveled frames. Within 96 hours, the plant was producing over 10,000 iPhones a day. The speed and flexibility is breathtaking, the executive said. Theres no American plant that can match that. <p>Ah yes, at midnight I'll just go walk over to my ""dormitories"" on my ""plantation"" and wake my ""employees"" and tell them to get to work harvesting cotton.

3509781,comment,3508382,3509553,4,0,mattmanser,,,"This is definitely not a fact, especially 'starvation response'. When I first read articles by Taubes I bought into it all to. Having now tried to lose weight 3 times, with the most recent being the one I have sustained the best, in my readings and my personal experience while on many points he is right, he has attributed a lot of things to the wrong reasons. The mystical insulin. This is also true if you've ever been tempted by Tim Ferris' 4 hour-body method.<p>I urge anyone considering weight loss to do some basic independent research to find out why. I have, I'm not posting this here to convince bad_user, this is just to add a counterpoint.<p>The starvation response, for example, was 'discovered' when they starved normal, healthy people for 6 months. 6 months. Let me just repeat that, normal, not overweight people, for 6 months. And even then, after all that, when they took into account muscle loss the difference in metabolism was statistically insignificant! Less than 100 cals a day. They can't even repeat the experiment now as it's considered unethical.<p>Another study that I saw frequently cited involved 2 people going to places like the artic! 2 people. And no debate whether the extreme cold was the reason for the metabolism drop.<p>And the bizarre thing about all this is there are not just a few counter examples, not a tiny amount, but millions of people losing weight through calorie restriction.<p>Your body will also never go into starvation mode, there are thousands of people on Reddit, for example, who do IF, intermittent fasting, they're all losing weight, often many of them gaining muscle at the same time through strength training.<p>Starvation response, if it even exists, is triggered in extremes, when you've lost <i>all</i> your body fat.<p>While 'Good Calories, Bad Calories' is kinda ok, there's plenty of evidence that pure calorie deficits work fine. A recent famous one is the guy who went on the twinkie diet, although I am obliged to point out this is 1 guy! Also there have been examples of people not losing weight on keto or paleo diets, the kind Taubes insists will magically make you lose weight, because they went mad on something that is calorie dense or they were small and so really have extra reason to count their calories.<p>Conveniently Taubes singles out nuts and diary, the two most calorie dense things that you're likely to over indulge in on his 'good calories', as not always for everyone waving his hands about insulin secretion.<p>I am consistently losing 2 lbs a week on a calorie deficit of 1000 calories a day. Guess what, the math adds up exactly. When I go a bit crazy on beer or food? 1lb instead of 2lb, quelle surprise, exactly what you would expect when I add up the calories. Yes there's fluctuations, yes there's water weight gains and losses. I sometimes have sandwiches for lunch, even cakes. I'm tall and have always stayed fairly fit so I can do that and still run a calorie deficit. Do those bad calories stop my weight loss? No.<p>One place you can find 100s of examples of weight loss on normal calorie restriction <i>every single day</i> is reddit.com/r/loseit. Most people there are on calorie deficits and are doing fine. Be warned that you will also find a lot of pseudo-science in the comments there too (the faq is a pretty good, no-nonsense summary).<p>What a lot of people report is going on a low-cal diet makes controlling hunger almost trivial. You don't have to go to the extremes of keto or paleo to achieve this. Fat fills you up, too many carbs causes insulin crashes that make you hungry again in a couple of hours. These are things I can believe in because I experience them myself. I have found this to be true, YMMV.<p>The most important lesson I can impart on weight loss is <i>find what works for you</i>. Oh and change your lifestyle permanently, if you gained weight before, diet and go back to your old life style, you'll obviously gain it again. I did.<p>Do <i>NOT</i> believe wholesale anything you read about weight loss. Including this! Some of this is probably wrong. It's still in the phase that early medicine was in, some truth, a lot of misunderstanding, lies and dubious 'scientific' studies. Including Gary Taubes.<p>EDIT: whoops, yes a week. Damn, a day would be good though.",1327501537

The law seems like it is trying to do the wrong thing. Restricting copying when it has no effect on original production is utterly counterproductive. If someone copies, in a case like this, we can presume it was because the material copied was good. And if they use it to sell a product, we can presume -- since they <i>are</i> actually making sales -- they are providing some useful service. Again, that is good.

(Say, what's the cost to <i>build</i> such a safe?)<p>Short of dismissing the question out of hand, the point remains that it is still a mere matter of money - something which can be soaked out of taxpayers as needed. Even if we're talking a small jurisdiction with grossly insufficient funds, I'll meet your hypothetical with one where the US Military is invited to have a whack at it - and they can whack pretty hard. It's just a matter of money, and for all practical purposes through history that's been enough to crack any safe. ...and with that kind of money in that safe, I'm sure you could resolve the problem. Short of a scenario where forcing the safe would provably destroy evidence, or delays cause grave bodily harm, they can put the safe in the evidence warehouse and indefinitely assign someone to resolve the issue, while you cool your heels in Graybar Hotel until they open it or you save taxpayers the cost of doing so.<p>This in contrast to encryption, where any idiot can pick a good algorithm with a high-bitcount high-entropy key which could not be cracked using the resources of the universe. This isn't a hypothetical, this is the OP case. Here, the prosecution truly does hinge on the defendant incriminating himself: no cooperation = no conviction.<p>If you can prove a safe, like encryption, can't be cracked short of universe-scale efforts, I'll change my position.",1327500507

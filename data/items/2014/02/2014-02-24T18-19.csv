Always willing to give the funny lines to everyone else.<p>I hope he gets the coverage that he deserves. He truly was one of the greats!<p>I know this sounds a bit selfish of me, but I kinda wish there was a third Ghostbusters movie (ya ya ya, the game was the &quot;3rd&quot; movie).

7292667,comment,7291626,7292592,1,0,haberman,,,"Thanks for posting this; I wished when writing the article that I had plain React benchmarks to run.<p>However when I profiled your benchmark it seems like it is invoking React&#x27;s event loop more than I would expect (and more than the React/Om benchmark does) -- do you have any idea why this would be?  It seems like for this to be apples to apples, it shouldn&#x27;t be invoking React&#x27;s update logic (ie. re-rendering everything) until the end of the benchmark.  Perhaps this difference is because of requestAnimationFrame?<p>I don&#x27;t understand this comment:<p>> I don&#x27;t think requestAnimationFrame has a lot to do with it, and immutability only slightly more; I think the real performance gain is in having an application data policy tailored to make the most of React&#x27;s behavior.<p>As I mentioned in my article, &quot;Benchmark 2&quot; is a no-op on the DOM.  So literally all React should be doing is calling render() before the benchmark (which returns basically nothing), letting the entire benchmark run, then calling render() again (in which it again returns basically nothing).<p>In other words, I don&#x27;t see what the &quot;application data policy&quot; has to do with making React efficient in this case; all we&#x27;re asking React to do here is calculate a no-op diff and then do nothing.",1393268398

7292654,comment,7291008,7292329,5,0,JackFr,,,"Linked article is not very sensible. It purposely conflates the dollar&#x27;s role as a reserve currency and its role as the numeraire in international oil transactions.  The first is a decision any central bank can make, and most keep a number of currencies on hand, though dollars predominate.  The other is a decision made by OPEC in the 1970&#x27;s which they have not seen fit to revisit, and frankly not something Iraq could do unilaterally.<p>Beyond that, the idea that there is any action Iraq could have taken which would have caused the dollar to fall in value 40-50% is ludicrous at its face.  The economy of Iraq compared to that of the United States is tiny.  The dollar reserves held by Iraq are tiny.  And frankly while the oil production of Iraq is not tiny, Saudi Arabia could make up the difference without breaking a sweat.  (Saudi Arabia produces well below capacity to manage the price.)<p>Finally, I don&#x27;t think that a decline in the dollar of 50% would have quite the effect described in the article.  As the largest external holder of dollar denominated debt, China would smart, but even more than the paper loss on there debt, their exports would no longer be competitive in the US, and they would lose their leading customer.  (Which is why China would not let it happen...)  On the other hand, American manufacturing and natural resources would once again more become competitive as real wages and costs fell.  Such a decline in the currency would lead to a real decline in quality of life no doubt, but its quite possible, that rather than a recession, you&#x27;d see very low unemployment.",1393268216

The whole idea of the tool is not to replace any of the existing tools, but to extend the toolset to concepts which treat text as data. In a way, it&#x27;s a metatool which provides an easy and familiar way to add more data processing concepts to the linux toolset. There are many cases where I use &#x27;wc -l&#x27; in order to count rows in a file, but if i need to count the rows of only the ones which have a specific column which is larger than the value X, or get the sum of some column per group, then q is a simple and readable way to do it properly, without any need for &quot;tricks&quot;.<p>My rationale for creating it is also explained in the README of the github project.<p>Any more comments are most welcome.<p>Harel",1393268212

If we continuously tell people to not bother with crypto at all, then we are being self-defeating.<p>Right now targeting those that use crypto is like shooting fish in a barrel. So few people are using crypto regularly, that they are incredibly easy to single out. If everyone used crypto, the amount it would cost state actors to find and further investigate individuals would quickly overwhelm the current resources of those state actors.<p>Obviously people using these devices need to know they aren&#x27;t foolproof and only use them for casual secrets that at most implicate, but not provide solid proof of activities considered subversive by a state actor.<p>Making the cost of dragnet mass surveillance phishing expeditions prohibitively expensive should be goal number one right now in the crypto community. State actors commit the crime of violating everyone&#x27;s privacy because it is so incredibly easy and cheap to do so.<p>I don&#x27;t know how much it currently costs for state intelligence agencies to investigate an individual, but whatever it is now, I would hope the the price were one to two orders of magnitude more expensive than it currently is and be at least in the 7 figure range. If someone really is a terrorist bent on causing lots of damage and killing civilians, it is trivial to justify spending 7 figures on surveilling that individual. The benefit of making it super expensive to surveil everyone, is that these state agencies can no longer casually surveil those it shouldn&#x27;t be, such as American lawyers doing work protected by attorney client privilege [0].<p>At the end of the day, although state actors have deep pockets, they are bounded to some degree by market factors like what activities they can legitimately justify given the cost of surveillance and the the amount of talent they have available.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/16/us/eavesdropping-ensnared-american-law-firm.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/16/us/eavesdropping-ensnared-...</a>",1393268010

I had a close family friend die of the flu. In his 50s.<p>The chance of developing Guillain–Barré syndrome is under one additional case per million vaccinations. [1] and catching the flu the regular way can contribute to developing Guillain-Barré syndrome and getting infected by influenza itself increases both the risk of death (up to 1 in 10,000) and increases the risk of developing Guillain-Barré syndrome to a much higher level than the highest level of suspected vaccine involvement (approx. 10 times higher by recent estimates). The WHO reports  &quot;Every winter, tens of millions of people get the flu. Most are only ill and out of work for a week, yet the elderly are at a higher risk of death from the illness. We know the worldwide death toll exceeds a few hundred thousand people a year, but even in developed countries the numbers are uncertain, because medical authorities don&#x27;t usually verify who actually died of influenza and who died of a flu-like illness.&quot; [2]<p>As I said before, all medical interventions go through a &quot;Risk–benefit analysis&quot; and no medical intervention is without risk. But do the benefits of getting the flu shot far outweigh the risks? That&#x27;s for you to decide, but anecdote does not make data. Your family is far more likely to contract Guillain–Barré syndrome from the flu than the flu vaccine.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guillain%E2%80%93Barr%C3%A9_syndrome"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guillain%E2%80%93Barr%C3%A9_syn...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza</a>",1393267315

ConEd kind of sucks, and I wish they were better, but really, they work well enough most of the time, and I&#x27;m not sure that I could name anybody else who would do it better.<p>The problem is that we sold off monopoly rights to broadband without attaching any strings of regulation, etc. Why should they bother to upgrade their infrastructure? Heck, we literally <i>paid</i> the cable companies billions of dollars of government money to do exactly that, and because we failed to enforce that with any real teeth, they just took the money and ran. Of course they&#x27;re not going to listen when consumers say they &quot;want gigabit&quot;.

For one, there simply isn&#x27;t enough fuel in the device at any given time. For another, maintaining the conditions that allow fusion reactions to happen doesn&#x27;t happen easily. If the equipment goes offline or haywire the worst case scenario is that the reactor stops.<p>Fusion reactors are like balancing a pencil on its tip. If anything goes wrong it simply falls over. Fission reactors are different in two ways. One, it&#x27;s possible for them to have a positive feedback in fission reaction rate due to lolss of coolant (this is called a &quot;positive void coefficient&quot;), but this can be changed in the design of the reactor and all modern reactors have a negative void coefficient. Two, fission byproducts are both extremely radiologically hazardous and continually producing heat from decay over long periods of time. This means that reactor fuel and used decomissioned fuel still needs to be actively cooled for a very long time, and if not then it can melt down which is very difficult to contain. These two problems are the genesis of the disasters at Chernobyl and Fukushima, respectively.<p>In contrast, the products of fusion reactor operations don&#x27;t get hot and as mentioned the reaction will just stop running if anything goes pear shaped. These factors alone are major reasons why fusion power is so desirable. It wouldn&#x27;t use of fossil fuels nor produce CO2 and would be unimaginably safer than fission power.",1393266835

Does the end justify the means? -What if the Sicilian mafia wants to feed a few poor people with the money they extort from you? -Would that make their extortion alright?<p>What if the mafia say they need your money to maintain peace in the neighbourhood?

7292446,comment,7287665,7290097,1,0,Homunculiheaded,,,"There are several things that help. Firstly you&#x27;re not just looking for a red light/green light significance. Since you&#x27;re actually modeling the beta distribution for each conversion rate you not only can ask &quot;what&#x27;s the probability that this test is an improvement?&quot; you can actually sample from both distributions and see what that improvement looks like.<p>For example I just simulated some bad data. A has 480 observations and a mean conversion of 33%, B has 410 observations and has a mean conversion of 37%. The p-value here is 0.0323 In the traditional A/B testing model we&#x27;d be done and claiming better than a 10% improvement!<p>However when I sample from these 2 beta distributions I see that my credible region is -2% to 34% meaning this new test could be anywhere from 2% worse to 34% better. No magic value is needed to tell you that you really don&#x27;t know anything yet.<p>Another huge help is the use of a prior. Until your data overrides your prior belief you aren&#x27;t going to see anything. Going with the last example, if I had a good prior that the true conversion rate on that page was actually 33% I wouldn&#x27;t have even gotten a p-value of less then 0.05. On the other hand if I had a strong prior that the conversion rate was 50% that would imply that both A and B were getting strangely unlucky results, which would actually boost the probability that B was in fact an improvement.<p>On the philosophical side, Bayesian statistics are simply trying to quantify what you know, not give you &#x27;yes&#x27;/&#x27;no&#x27; answers. Maybe the gamble of -2 to 34 is good for you, or maybe you really want to know tighter bounds on your improvement and aren&#x27;t comfortable with any possibility of decline. Bayesian statistics gives you a direct way to trade off certainty with time.",1393266410

Firm A forces Netflix to pay $1/month for access to enough bandwidth to stream movies in HD to your house, because they want you to use janky-streams.com, which they own. Firm B keeps their peering infrastructure up-to-date without charging Netflix. Where does this leave you as a consumer?<p>All else equal, you&#x27;ll switch over to Firm B. Why? Because Netflix works there even without paying a ransom for their data. It costs Netflix more money to provide their service to you on Firm A. They could pass that cost along to you directly (increase Netflix bill $1/month) or reduce the stream quality and blame the ISP. The end result is that you&#x27;re paying more or getting worse service because of the Net Neutrality violation.<p>However, Firm A understands this logic.

Depending on the size of the company, the people you&#x27;re interviewing may not know about funding issues and exit strategies.<p>Asking about Runway is a good question. If you&#x27;re worried about coming into work one day and finding the office closed, ask point blank about your concern. This is a good test question to see if the company believes in transparency.<p>You&#x27;re right, the company may not want to go into too much details on it&#x27;s traction and funding, but they should be comfortable talking openly about your concerns.<p>As to new funding, you should be able to find out their last funding round, either through Crunchbase, or from SEC Filings. Startups tend to fundraise in the late spring, and the late fall. Come thanksgiving, investors are hunkered down for the holidays, and summer vacations make it difficult to get people together. So if you&#x27;re approaching a company during those times, you can assume their prepping for a funding push later.<p>Despite what others may say, the CEO is always fundraising. Perhaps not actively, but working towards their next round.<p>Ask about milestones towards their next raise. If their a consumer app, what are their MAU targets. If their SaaS business, what are their Churn and MRR numbers. What are some other milestones that they&#x27;re pushing towards?<p>Questions about potential exits aren&#x27;t that interesting, because it&#x27;s easy to judge a business that is poised for IPO, and those that are ripe for acquisition.<p>If the business has taken institutional money, then there really is only two viable outcomes: Acquisition, or going Public. Investors won&#x27;t invest in lifestyle businesses.<p>[Soapbox]\nYour family&#x27;s financial well-being hopefully isn&#x27;t tied to a stint at a startup. Perhaps I&#x27;m a bit old school, but I believe in some amount of financial planning--something like a rainy day fund that can keep you afloat for 3 months without income. \n[/Soapbox]<p>It&#x27;s not just startups that are at risk for closing down. Irrational Games just closed shop and let go of all but 15 people, and that was despite releasing several AAAA blockbuster titles.<p>Losing your job at a startup isn&#x27;t nearly as bad as you might think. There is a major shortfall in technical talent in most startup hubs, investors and founders are always looking for talent. After Zynga shut it&#x27;s seattle offices down, a local VC here had an open house for the employees that were let go. So, if things go bad, many founders and investors will work to help secure you a position elsewhere. Plus, again, it&#x27;s hard to hire people.",1393266251

7292336,comment,7291236,7292225,6,0,agwa,,,"> A /64 is the base unit for public routing. The recommendation is that each single end-site should have a /64. A company or collection of hosts should get a /48. An ISP should have a /32 or perhaps more than one (though I doubt many are big enough to need more than one).<p>Actually, that&#x27;s not quite what RFC6177/RFC3177 say.  RFC3177 actually recommended /48&#x27;s for all end-sites (even home network subscribers) except when it was known by design that only one subnet was needed (a very special case).  RFC6177 updated that to be a bit more nuanced, saying that smaller allocations were OK (suggesting /56 for home network subscribers) but still emphasized that end-sites need to have more than just a /64.<p>> Things are a little confused with VPS providers. If you are running your own box (or boxes) with many VMs for your self/company on it then a /64 for the whole lot is how it is generally done, but for renting out VPSs you should have a /48 and give out /64s to your clients (probably not one per VPS, but one per client).<p>A VPS provider, being more akin to an ISP, should get a larger allocation (such as a /32; note that Linode actually has a /30 from ARIN).  To truly be useful, they should be <i>routing</i> at least a /64 to each VPS, to enable that VPS to perform further routing as needed (for example, if it&#x27;s running a VPN server).",1393265578

The PR is complete, however, so feel free to use my branch. It does offer very meaningful speedups, especially when data changes rapidly or causes a chain reaction. I have not benchmarked it in comparison to React/Om but it is very fast.<p>The implementation is simple; when render() is called, the render is queued up. Every ~16ms (RAF or setTimeout), any pending renders are executed. If another render() is called within that time frame, the earlier is dropped.<p>So long as you expect an async API and listen only to events/hooks (&#x27;beforeRender&#x27;, &#x27;afterRender&#x27;), it works pretty well. Backbone.LayoutManager supports it fully and it is configurable in case you rely on synchronous renders, which can be helpful in tests.<p>1. <a href=""https://github.com/tbranyen/backbone.layoutmanager/pull/421"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/tbranyen/backbone.layoutmanager/pull/421</a>",1393265564

7292273,comment,7291970,7291970,25,0,jfasi,,,"I view the broadband industry as a fascinating example of what happens when an infrastructure industry meets the technology industry. TWC and friends were established to enact a business plan that&#x27;s been viable and profitable for centuries: laying down expensive infrastructure is economically feasible if most of the cost comes up front and you can charge rents on it for decades. Stability is crucial. This is the economic reasoning that built the cable TV network, and the phone network before that, and the power grid before that, and the railroad network before that, etc.<p>Trouble is, this business model severely discourages new development (witness the &quot;No one wants gigabit&quot; rationale). Why interrupt your twenty year plan just to extend its life a year or two into the future? This isn&#x27;t a bad thing if your industry is basically a utility industry, where technological changes move at a glacial pace. God help you if you enter into the technology industry armed only with the economic and managerial tools of a utility juggernaut.<p>So we&#x27;ve got ourselves a conflict. On one side there are irritated customers wondering why their service is so poor and why their bills are so high. On the other there are communications utilities providers: while they have a legitimate business need to keep their networks profitable, they are paying the price for committing the gravest sin possible in the technology world: complacency.",1393264949

7292255,comment,7288957,7290534,1,0,avalaunch,,,"It sounds like you have a very loose definition of what gambling is, going so far as to suggest that placing wagers on chess would be gambling because you might not be certain of your opponent&#x27;s skill level, and thus cannot predict the outcome.  Most definitions of gambling would reject that as an identifying characteristic is that the game be a game of chance. That being said, you might find it interesting to know that professional online poker players usually have a LOT of information about their opponents - usually more than enough to gauge their skill level.  There are sites that mine every hand ever played online and then programs that compile that data into useful information that is then displayed beside each player&#x27;s icon while you play.  We know each player&#x27;s win/lose percentage, how aggressive or passive they are, how likely they are to bluff, fold to a bluff, ect...  In addition there are programs that help professionals find the best tables to play at - not only where the opponents are the weakest, but where they are the weakest against your particular style of play.  Luck is minimized as much as possible.  The true minimizer of luck, however, is volume.  I&#x27;ve literally played million of hands of poker.  Out of 7 years of play, I&#x27;ve had plenty of losing days, but only a handful of losing months, and never any losing years.<p>As for whether poker is a game of chance, I would argue that the level of skill involved trumps the level of chance and thus doesn&#x27;t qualify.  A good poker player is much like a casino.  On any given bet they could lose but in the long term they never do because they always have an edge on their opponents.<p>But more importantly, there&#x27;s luck involved in almost everything you do, and you can almost never predict with certainty the outcome of your actions.  Should we seek to avoid all luck in life, or perhaps only when money is involved?  That would mean we could no longer make investments in anything.  Even putting your money in a savings account has, perhaps not luck, but at least a degree of risk involved.  There are some things I would never risk in life but money isn&#x27;t one of those things.  Money is just a means to an end.",1393264838

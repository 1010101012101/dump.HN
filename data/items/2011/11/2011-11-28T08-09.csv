3285150,comment,3284537,3284880,1,0,bluekeybox,,,"There should also be a guide on how to copy without losing face, if only because losing face tends to cheapen your brand. Look how Apple copied from Xerox -- the underlying idea for the GUI was the same but the whole ""look"" was completely redone and customized, to the extent that lead even many smart people to believe that it was actually Apple who invented that interface. What Samsung's doing, on the other hand, is nothing less than slavish imitation -- they not only borrow the underlying idea, but also not even bother to make the product appear different on the surface (or they assume that by churning out products look similar enough to Apple's they can save in the marketing/design department, thinking along the lines of ""oh hey, Apple's look/style is already 'in', so why bother inventing another one?""). There's copying, and then there's copying.<p>The first kind of imitation is due to one being forced to choose what's the absolute best out there. The second kind of imitation is simply due to one being cheap and trying to save bucks on design. That's a huge difference. A lot of people mix up these two ways of copying. However, the distinction between the two is precisely what is captured by the quote, ""good artists copy, great artists steal."" Stealing is done in a shy and low-key way so that nobody would notice, while copying, on the other hand, is blatant, slavish imitation. One has to know how to steal.<p>Sorry, I have no pity for those who slavishly imitate, though I do have a certain admiration for those who know well how to steal.",1322470218

I'm a little older and a little greyer than the poster boy rockstar-ninja founder and I have far more important things in my life than work. This doesn't mean I don't work hard, but it does mean I'm not sacrificing the things most precious to me for a web app. Paradoxically this could mean I need to work much harder within my constraints and I'm fine with that.<p>I have a few thoughts on how I could go about this - and they are only ill-defined thoughts at the moment, but I would be much obliged for any input this community has to offer.<p>Ideally I'd like to work with others on this. I've tried the sole founder thing before but I miss having people to bounce ideas off, share the workload, share the spoils or just without them knowing it, getting me through one of the dark days that are bound to come along.<p>I'd want to split things as evenly as possibly, skewed just enough in favour of the person who is best to guide things along (this doesn't even necessarily have to be myself, though I don't foresee it not being). When money comes in, we each take our split. With a little luck we've all got some walking around money without any of the burn-out inducing hours and load that can happen.<p>Which brings me onto my next thought: time. I see this as being a part-time venture in terms of the hours put in. We all work say 16 hours/week - as much as possible on a schedule convenient to that person. I haven't thought out the exact number too much yet but I think 16 is low enough to fit comfortably around a fulltime job, yet enough to get things done if there are at least a couple of us.<p>This isn't something to make you rich beyond the dreams of avarice, but with a bit of luck and a bit of time, maybe it will be provide a nice little income. Maybe one day it will turn into something worth going full time at (and compensated accordingly of course).  If it all blows up, then fine, we go our seperate ways and hopefully everyone had a good time, at least got a little money out of it and can still go back to the day job.<p>Like I said, these are still-forming thoughts at the moment and I'm sure there are huge holes to be torn in my thinking but I do believe that somewhere in here is a system that can be made to work. It won't be for everyone, but your traditional startup isn't for me so I'd rather have likeminded folks on this anyway.<p>I may still be a little drunk from last night but I'm a long-time member of this site (even if I'm cowardly hiding behind a throwaway) and I value the insights I know a lot of you can offer.<p>Have at me! :)",1322469725

For example, most companies don't offer cost of living salary adjustments even though company revenues would presumably increase by a similar amount.

I'm no psychologist, but I think that the majority of current research points towards the idea that ability in almost anything is essentially a consequence of practice and experience.<p>I think the real issue is telling kids that they have an innate gift for <i>anything</i>. If you tell them they're smart, there's a natural assumption not to bother working. If you tell them they're disciplined, they won't look for ways to keep themselves motivated.<p>I'd be more inclined towards saying something more along the lines of ""you're doing really well at X"" - providing useful, motivational feedback, without implying that no work is necessary.<p>Personally, as someone who coasted through a lot of school but ran into trouble later (effectively because I'd forgotten how to 'pedal') the two things I would have been most grateful for:<p>1. Balance. If someone has a facile grasp of e.g. science and maths, don't (from a young age) overly steer them towards specialising in it. Instead, say ""for the rest of this academic year, you only need to do a 'maintenance' level of work on science, so we're going to take that time and spend it on areas you're less good at"". Of course, this level of personal attention is expensive, because it implies stuff like small classes and high-quality teachers who care - but OTOH I was lucky enough to have those things, but not with this strategy.<p>2. Challenge. Science and maths were always easy for me, so I never had to work. This is damaging. So there would also have been value in doing the the converse of point (1) - saying ""for the rest of this academic year, you only need to do a 'maintenance' level of work on the standard science curriculum, so we're going to use that as an opportunity for you to do harder, more independent work in those areas"" and develop a better work ethic and an ability do do things independently. Again, needs lots of personal attention and even better teachers.<p>We sometimes do OK-ish at (2) - in a fairly haphazard kind of way, and partly because kids tend to do it for themselves - but I can't think of any examples of anyone really pursuing (1) (may be different in different cultures). This is an opportunity, because (1) requires a lot less deep subject knowledge, so is much more feasible for parents to pursue.<p>Ultimately though, optimising for the top end becomes expensive quite fast, and while it's important to keep pushing the boundaries, I'd much rather the investment was put into improving the state of education for everyone, rather than fine-tuning the path for those who will be at least OK regardless.",1322469303

3285078,comment,3284206,3284722,21,0,_dps,,,"I suspect it boils down to two things: the number of ways in which things can compete and the perceived level of normal consumption.<p>Starting with the latter: people who drink coffee mostly see it as near-daily consumption. If they're thinking about it at all, they're not thinking about ""will I have coffee"", but rather ""which coffee to have"". On the other hand, many software buyers have ""don't buy anything"" as a very real possibility in their minds. If I ""have to buy it anyway"", the difference between $2 and $4 per day doesn't seem important because people are surprisingly bad at multiplying by 365.<p>Coffee also presents a much less complex competitive landscape than software (which is not to say it is less competitive; I strongly suspect the reverse is true). As far as I can tell coffee shops can compete on price, location, ambience, brand, and flavor. My guess is that, above a fairly low bar for flavor, location is the dominant competitive attribute. ""Am I going to walk an extra block to save $1?"" Again, people don't know how to multiply by 365. I suspect coffee shops strategize thusly: ""I'll get whatever customer base is closer to me than to competitors, and fighting on price is pointless. I might get some marginal purchases by improving branding and ambience, thus persuading people to stay longer and buy more."" So everyone pays $4 at the nearest half-decent coffee shop and all is peaceful in the universe.<p>Software, on the other hand, is an incredibly complex offering and I think that complexity leads to a perception that diligent consumer research will be rewarded with enhanced satisfaction or reduced expenditure. The problem here is that the reduced expenditure is easy to quantify and <i>guaranteed prior to purchase</i>, whereas the enhanced satisfaction is poorly quantified and feels uncertain unless you're dealing with a market-leading strongly-branded product like Angry Birds. So, unless your'e buying Angry Birds, you'll spend some time looking to see what other apps are cheaper with ""the same"" features.<p>Hm.

Find a way to teach them that achievement is hollow (and not true achievement) unless they really worked for it.<p>My parents were relentless in assessing my effort, not the grade I got - the grade itself was treated as an irrelevance (of course it wasn't to them, but the pretence was enough to fool me). Yes yes you got full marks - but the questions teacher said you needed a calculator to do, can you do them by hand? It's great you're keeping up with classwork - but if you flick ahead a few pages in the textbook you'll find extension exercises, have you done them too?<p>At the time, I <i>did not</i> appreciate this approach - I could outperform any of my friends and not receive the praise I felt was due me. In fact at 18 I got the highest grades in the UK - and still my parents expressed disappointment because they knew I was capable of higher (I got 100% in one subject, but a second was also attainable with more effort). I'm not saying this was a perfect strategy - it did go a little too far the other way and make me feel I wasn't capable of anything truly impressive.<p>However this article made me realise how important this was. By moving the emphasis away from the grades, you can define standards that are relevant for you; that genuinely do represent an achievement because they require great effort. For me that meant aiming for things other people said couldn't be done. I did an entire maths A-level from self-study alongside my other qualifications; I switched course at Uni and taught myself the entire first year Cambridge engineering course over the summer, so I could join in second year.

I also suffered RLS (restless leg syndrome) for years and read some article at some point indicating that it could be due to iron and b-complex deficiency.  For many years, any time I got RLS, I would take b-complex and then if that didn't resolve it I would follow up thirty minutes later with iron.  Treating my RLS symptomatically began resolving more serious problems by addressing the underlying root causes and at the age 40 I suddenly began having regular menstrual periods for the first time in my life because I stopped being severely anemic. I had never been told there was a real problem with me having irregular periods.  It was ""normal"" for my family, no big. Well, turns out ""normal for my family"" isn't actually proof of no problem.<p>I also tried taking things out of my diet that, by observation, appeared to be causing me issues and then researched after the fact why that might be so as to better understand it.  One thing I eliminated early on was peanut oil. Turns out it is very pro-inflammatory and my main medical issue has a very significant inflammatory component.<p>I no longer take boatloads of supplements.  I have figured out what foods support good health for me and what foods are a serious problem given my medical condition.  I make sure I routinely get adequate quantities of those foods that meet my needs well and fairly stringently avoid those foods that cause problems and keep a keen eye on limiting foods that are tolerable but not ideal (as too much of such foods do start causing issues after a while).  I got off a long list of drugs and I now also do a lot of walking for exercise.  I have the best quality of life in terms of my health that I've ever had.",1322467763

In order:<p>The first one appears to make the argument that since the background images are similar colors, Android copied. But they're both nature scenes (one day, one night) and the sky really only comes in shades of blue... The author could be talking about the icon shape (square) but that's even more ridiculous since that's been the standard in desktop OSes for more than a decade.<p>The second one shows Gmail on the left, which looks the same as the Gmail web interface, and the iOS mail app on the right. The only similarities are the colors and the layout. The colors: Gmail had them long, long before iOS was ever released. The layout: Outlook did it first in the early 2000s.<p>The third: Two keyboards, both with white keys and a similar color background. However, other than the (standardized) QWERTY layout, the button placement is entirely different. Further, the Android one shows off Swype, something not present in iOS.<p>The fourth: Apparently the Android tablet calendar interface (I dunno, I don't have an Android tablet) paired against... I don't know. It looks like a third-party web app. It's definitely not a calendar.<p>The fifth: A third-party chat client paired against the iOS Facebook app. Neither of those are written by Google, Samsung, or Apple. Both are third-party. Fail.<p>The sixth: Uh, they're both black devices with an LCD screen? Them and every other smartphone on the market. Hint: RIM did black smartphones first, in the 90s.",1322467463

If she's truly smart, she is going to be top of her class without any effort for at least another 6-8 years. So, what I would suggest is to first try and cultivate an ethic of going above and beyond, and always doing work you ""can take pride in"" (when the work is too easy, without established values it can get very hard to keep caring and avoid turning in B- after B-) and second turning her on to more outside of school. When I was a little kid this manifest as a voracious appetite for books and Legos, which fed my imagination and logical thinking. Magic (the card game) was my replacement for chess.<p>Different kids will be interested in different things, but in general they are hungry to learn, so if school is easy you just have to find that extra interest outside of school and they will go crazy. Science, especially life sciences, geology, and such are usually solid choices because a sharp child is going to be inquisitive about the world around them.<p>(Don't <i>ignore</i> school, of course)",1322467282

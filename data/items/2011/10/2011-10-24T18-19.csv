3150985,comment,3149360,3149986,5,0,dbfclark,,,"The real problem Hazlett ignores is the existence of market failures in the actual world. The labor market in particular is rife with failures, in areas from search costs to market power, to the point where many labor economists model the labor market as a monopsony, i.e. a single-buyer market, which is one of the classic situations where government intervention to raise prices can increase total surplus. There's a whole discipline of labor economics that deals with the fact that the labor market is imperfect in excitingly complex ways.<p>In general a real market is imperfect in any case where firms make profit above their cost of capital -- i.e. most of it -- since perfect competition is supposed to drive profits to zero everywhere. The employees of a firm making profits certainly can be paid more without imperiling production, since the profits could simply be reduced.<p>Almost throughout, Hazlett makes exactly this (very common, for those with a political axe to grind) fallacy, supposing implicitly everywhere that no company is profitable despite the fact that we are manifestly not living in that world.",1319482454

3150972,comment,3149320,3149320,6,0,mrampton,,,"It's all too common (and easy) to lump cyclists into one group -- generally (in terms of policy and public opinion) in a way that encourages dislike.  Cyclists are like any other subset of the population and it's unfair to any group to judge them based on the actions of others.  That being that, I don't pretend that there aren't cyclists out there who misbehave -- I'm personally very aware of it because they're often the cause of me being treated badly by cars/drivers.  As a cyclist, the most effective way I've found to combat this is to be courteous where it matters most -- generally by waving/nodding when you are given the go ahead to cross an intersection by a driver who has the right-away (or more generally, shown any courtesy on the road).<p>Now, that doesn't mean I go out of my way to exude a staid nature on the bike; I'm generally riding as fast as I care to or want to -- but the thing about being on a bike is that speed is (generally) physically governed -- I cannot ride any faster than my body allows. And in most pedestrian settings (i.e. without the presence of significant downhill stretches) this will be between 15 and 30mph (Individual TTs in the TDF will maybe see an avg speed of 30-33mph -- wattage and speed way out of the reach for anyone but the strongest riders on the most advanced machines).<p>I bring this up to make a point, a dangerous cyclist (i.e. the dudes you see running lights and being jerks with disregard to everyone else) is dangerous but only marginally as compared to a dangerous driver.  And this is of course due to the fact that cyclists are limited to pedestrian speeds (30mph going all) and constitute a small fraction of the mass  of a car (200lbs:3000lbs+).  But they are dangerous (especially to pedestrians -- one reason they should never be riding on sidewalks) nonetheless and I'd love for everyone to show a little more common courtesy.<p>More than that, however, I wish (more) drivers were aware of how threatening they are in their vehicles (sometimes weapons).  Never am I more aware of how fragile the balance of life is as when I'm on my bike with an angry driver alongside me verbally berating me. And this is because riding the bike is not as easy as driving a car in the best of times (neither of which is especially difficult) -- but in the worst of times it's much harder. And your being alongside me with your window down is about as bad as they come. Not only do I have to continue navigating the road I now also have to consider you and your intentions.  You might just be someone who wants to get something off their chest and be on the their way (still far better to do it when neither of us are moving). Or you might be one of the others who will only find solace once you've swerved at the me or run me off the road (yes, I have been maliciously run off the road; no, it's not so uncommon). So my senses flare and my defensive instincts kick in any time a car rolls up with something to say because the moment you do you change from being a driver of a car to a potentially dangerous and unpredictable stranger with a weapon.  I doubt I'm far from the the only one to feel this way based on how inflammatory these situations routinely become.  It doesn't help that the law will generally take the side of the driver or find themselves impuissant due to the fact that cars can and do flee the scene with none the wiser (ever try to get a license plate number down from a fleeing vehicle -- they don't need much distance on you to make it hopeless)<p>Now that being that, I understand how easy it is to lump individuals in as belonging to ""that group"".  Despite the number of mean spirited drivers I've encountered, they stand out only because we tend to overlook all the others who are good spirited (and thus never give you cause to notice or appreciate them -- in fact i've only been caught off guard with a car rolling up with a pleasantry/compliment two times).  I personally suspect that the malicious drivers themselves are repeat offenders and are responsible for the vast majority of encounters (i.e. if there are 10,000 drivers in an area, and 100 events occur it implies 1% of drivers were involved; what's more likely is that a repeat offending driver causes multiple events over a certain route or a time period which means only a fraction of 1% of the drivers are involved).<p>Which means I should respect you as long as you don't threaten me, and you should respect me provided the same.  But let me tell you, it takes just about all my willpower to not rip your head off when you confront me in your car while I'm already giving it my best to be courteous and safe; I do give it my best, though.",1319482212

3150962,comment,3149360,3149360,12,0,dxbydt,,,"I must have read this book a hundred times, no kidding. It is a great book, or rather, a great piece of writing. That said, it has nothing to do with economics. It should really be titled 'Hazlitt in One Lesson.' This man, armed with his rhetoric ammunition, is an absolute genius, and fells the members of his community with brutal, ruthless precision. The book goes on the offensive from the get go. From then on, its just hack, chop, thrust, pierce...quite amazing actually. Each time I read it, I feel like I've witnessed a battle of gladiators and in the end Hazlitt holds the lone sword thrust deeply into Keynes' heart.<p>There have been and will be multitudes who will take on Keynes. Studying at UChicago exposed me to the Lucas critique ( <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucas_critique"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucas_critique</a> ), in which Professor and Nobel laurate Robert Lucas uses the ""econometric models aren't policy-invariant"" device to bludgeon Keynesian thought. But then, that stuff is fairly deep, mathematical, and ergo, boring. You'd have to know what econometrics is, and what's policy invariant, and how changing the policy midstream will cause the parameters of your underlying econometric model to alter and so on....not exactly the sort of thing that'll charge you up. Hayek's critique of Keynesian thought is again fairly deep and requires thought.<p>What works for Hazlitt is the general dumbness and idiocy of the reader. The average reader of Hazlitt assumes that a nation is just like his house scaled by a magnitude of a billion, so if he as a householder is able to live within his means and balance his budget, the nation must also do the same, otherwise the economic policies of the nation are bogus and the economists are incompetent frauds. This is the same sort of reader who consumes pop-science. The same reader who thinks multivariable calculus is just high school arithmetic scaled by a million, and that graduate students working on real algebra in their 20s are really solving quadratic equations of the ax^2+bx+c type he solved in his teens, just with bigger numbers! You can't reason with such people. Or maybe you can, but I can't. So whenever I meet people who are taken with Hazlitt, I first check if they like Hazlitt as a sarcastic comic book or whether they actually believe everything they've read. If its the latter, I slowly back away and run for the hills.<p>One of the threads above says Hazlitt isn't out to educate you, rather he's out to convert you. I think it is neither. Hazlitt is pure comedy gold. He is out to entertain you, but he is so subtle and underplayed most readers interpret his antics literally and walk around chanting ""The Broken Window Fallacy"" as if it is some mathematical theorem. To actually think ""the most important lesson about economics is: One must consider not just what is seen, but also unseen."" is incredibly naive, plain silly and quite stupid, to be blunt. If that is all what economics was about, why, we'd all get our doctorates in econ and our Nobel too for that matter.<p>""One must consider not just what is seen, but also unseen"" is just as vacuously empty as ""good begets good"" or ""haste makes waste"" or other catchy platitudes. You can spin these things to mean just about whatever you want. To say that's the most important lesson econ has to offer...Ha!",1319482115

3150931,comment,3149337,3150116,114,0,danielna,,,"Hi oconnore,<p>I'm an Acute Mylogenous Leukemia (AML) survivor and a Level 2 ambassador with the National Marrow Donor Program.  I'd like to thank you for your honesty, as a lack of awareness (and the resulting fear) is one of the biggest obstacles the NMDP faces when trying to recruit donors.  Your perspective really is something that I think a lot of people feel but don't necessarily share, and I commend you for having the courage to do so.  It's a step in the right direction for finding the right means of educating the public.<p>I'll try to respond to some of your questions as best I can, but please keep in mind that I am not a doctor and while I have received volunteer training from the NMDP, any thoughts expressed in this post are my own.<p>Your bone marrow is the mechanism in your body that generates blood cells.  Blood is composed of a few different parts -- red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets and plasma.  Red blood cells carry oxygen throughout the body, plasma is the liquid, platelets help in clotting to prevent bleeding and white blood cells act as the carriers of the body's immune system.<p>What happened with me (and likely with Amit) is that at some point a mutation occurred within my bone marrow so it began generating malformed white blood cells.  Instead of behaving like a normal immune system these mutated cells did nothing but fill up my blood stream, inhibiting the growth and transport of normal white blood cells and platelets.  As a result I began to get progressively sicker, with bruising appearing over my body.  As you can imagine this situation gets very dangerous very quickly, as doctors told me that if I hadn't gone into the ER when I did I ran the risk of bleeding in my brain while walking to class.<p>Chemotherapy was used to effectively kill off all aspects of my blood -- white blood cells, red blood cells, platelets included.  The hope here was for chemo to wipe out as much as it could in hopes of eliminating all traces of cancer in my bone marrow.  Due to the human body's natural resiliency, after chemo eventually the bone marrow would start to regenerate.  The hope was that after this regeneration happened no cancer cells would be reproduced.<p>For me, it was a waiting game: undergo chemo, wait to see if cancer reappeared.  I did this six times (2 inductive rounds, 4 consolidation rounds).  Thankfully after those first two rounds I was in the clear.  I've been in remission for a little over four years now, and I still go into the doctor for regular blood tests.<p>While I'm not exactly sure of the medical reasons why bone marrow transplants are needed, I do know that a very simplistic view of them is that they're necessary when chemotherapy is not enough.  Whether it's because the chemotherapy is ineffective or specific DNA markers or whatever, there are times when the body's natural bone marrow is no longer effective in producing normal blood cells.  It's a dangerous procedure for the recipient (because of the possibility of the body rejecting the transplant) but it's not considered in circumstances where other viable alternatives exist.  It really is something of a last resort.<p>For donors, joining the registry is painless and extremely simple.  The NMDP asks you to check against a preliminary health screening (<a href=""http://www.marrow.org/Join/Medical_Guidelines/Medical_Guidelines_for_Joining_the_Registry.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.marrow.org/Join/Medical_Guidelines/Medical_Guidel...</a>), understand the commitment (<a href=""http://marrow.org/Join/Your_Commitment.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://marrow.org/Join/Your_Commitment.aspx</a>), and fill out a form with some medical/contact information to make sure that you can be contacted in the event of a match.  I read a statistic that less than 50% of those currently within the registry (1) can be contacted successfully and (2) are willing to donate once a match is found. (<a href=""http://www.ij.org/about/2903"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ij.org/about/2903</a>)  The form asks for your contact information and the contact information of two others who do not live with you, just in case you happen to move elsewhere at a later date.  The NMDP takes privacy very seriously, and will not solicit you or others with the contact information you provide.<p>The form comes with a swab kit consisting of four cotton swabs.  These swabs are processed by the NMDP to match donors and recipients by specific DNA markers.  To register, you simply swab the inside of your cheek with each swab, for 20 seconds each.  Put the swabs back into the kit and then they're sent off for processing.  That's it; a form and four cheek swabs.<p>A donor's commitment when joining the registry is to be on the registry until they're 61, although they can remove themselves from the registry at any time.<p>Given the specific DNA markers used to match donors and recipients, realistically the chances are that you will never be called to donate marrow.  According to the FAQ here (<a href=""http://amitguptaneedsyou.tumblr.com/faq"" rel=""nofollow"">http://amitguptaneedsyou.tumblr.com/faq</a>), the NMDP puts the odds at 1 in 540.<p>If you do one day receive a call to be a donor, there are currently two main methods of bone marrow donation.  The first, Peripheral Blood Stem Cell (PBSC) donation, is used in over 70% of cases and is described in detail here: <a href=""http://www.marrow.org/Registry_Members/Donation/Steps_of_Donation.aspx#step2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.marrow.org/Registry_Members/Donation/Steps_of_Don...</a>.  Another good reference is this site: <a href=""http://helpingtami.org/asian_bone_marrow_and_pbsc.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://helpingtami.org/asian_bone_marrow_and_pbsc.html</a>, which despite the cartoonish graphics, serves as a pretty accurate representation of what PBSC entails.  You get a shot for a few days that kicks up your normal bodily process of bone marrow production into overdrive, to the point where bone marrow cells enter your bloodstream.  You donate blood, after which bone marrow cells are irradiated out.  The blood is then put back into your body.  I've personally received the shot (called Neupogen) that is used to kick up your bone marrow production over 30 times, as it was used following each of my rounds of chemo.  A common side effect of the drug is that it makes you a bit achy and sore, as if you had gone on a long hike the day before.  I did not feel any significant discomfort on neupogen to the point where I couldn't go about my day as normal.<p>The other procedure is extracting bone marrow from your hip bone, which is performed under general anaesthetic.  It is also depicted on the helpingtami.org link above.  30% of bone marrow donations are performed this way, and I believe it's usually due to restrictions of the recipient.  Receiving a bone marrow transplant can be extremely taxing on the human body, and if a patient is too young or old for PBSC a bone marrow extraction is requested in its place.  Admittedly this process is more invasive, and as a result donors are put to sleep.  Doctors use special, hollow needles to extract little bits of bone marrow from your hip, and because the needles are small it does require a lot of sticks to collect enough marrow for a transplant.  I've also had this procedure done to me, albeit in a lesser volume -- it's the same process used to perform bone marrow biopsies.  I was awake for the procedure both times and received local (vs. general) anaesthetic.  Needles are needles so there was discomfort, but it was very quick -- like a hard pinch.  Patients are sore for a few days afterwards, more so than PBSC, but recover quickly.  Donors perform a full health scan before donating in the interests of their own well being as well as the patient, so if you're not healthy enough to donate and recover, you will probably not be allowed to get to that point in the first place.<p>When donors join the registry they commit to donating to anyone in need, not just the person the drive is in honor of.  So although a local drive may be in honor of Amit, the power of the awareness being raised by the publicity of his sickness is that there are people who have never heard of Amit Gupta that will have their lives saved by his efforts, perhaps even decades from now.  I know that Amit is a very important person in the technical community, but please remember that everyone who needs a donor is the most important person in the world to somebody -- a parent, a sibling, a child or a best friend.  In that regard I believe that everyone who has someone in their life that they love more than themselves can empathize with what it must be like to be powerless to help that person in their time of greatest need.<p>Please consider joining the bone marrow registry.  It truly is the opportunity to save someone's life.",1319481657

You are probably familiar with the Prisoners' Dilemma, right?<p>More abstractly, there are situations where it is in the individuals' self interests to behave in a certain way that will lead everybody to end up in a place where they are worse off than if everybody coordinated to achieve an outcome that is not a Nash equilibrium.<p>If you define ""efficiency"" as being ""the outcome that you get when there is no cooperation between actors"", then you're basically saying ""efficiency = Nash equilibria with no cooperation"". Then government action (which is simply one possible form of cooperation between actors) is inefficient by definition. But then that's simply a tautology, and a useless one at that. After all, whether the outcome is a Nash equilibrium or not is not a moral category.<p>If you define ""efficiency"" as being ""the outcome is optimal according to some welfare function"" (e.g. social optimality, Pareto optimal, sum of logs, or whatever), then Nash equilibria and efficient outcomes are not the same thing, unless you can somehow exclude the possibility of Prisoner Dilemma-type situations.<p>Do you have an argument against the existence of Prisoner Dilemmas when it comes to price-setting dynamics?<p>Edit: And to answer your question about a ""morally right wage"", I think there was simply a misunderstanding between us. There is a moral argument that human labour should be given some appropriate value. This is similar to more general arguments for human dignity and human rights. This is a question of morality and ethics, and it can be the basis upon which a society decides to introduce a minimum wage law.

Maybe any hand over two cards should disapear. Also dragging cards down from the top I often hit the pulldown screen in iOS5.<p>The important feedback is about your launch. You are going to be better off not having a pro and free version. Ship one free version. Do in app purchases to remove ads and try and get some kind of other in app purchase in the game (levels, other/card games). Preferably try and get consumable in app purchases in there too. If people want to pay give them that opportunity.<p>Finally, you are leaving SEO juice on the table by not implementing game center and iPad view controllers. Both of those things get you in categories on the app store that are smaller overall than the general listing. Also, entertainment is usually the best category to publish in for these types of games. Always, always release on a friday - having the app in the new releases list over the weekend helps and it's hard out there for a pimp.<p>Order of things I would fix:<p>1) Add game center (very easy)<p>2) Make it a universal app (iPad view controllers) it's not as much work as you think.<p>3) In app purchase and dump the paid version.

That book has some rhetorical elegance, and it certainly hides away is Aether, but if you look at it closely (and really, the chapters aren't so long that you'd be wasting time to read a couple), and try to substitute Aether for whatever hasn't been argued for or scientifically established (and that is <i>a fine exercise in reading</i>), you'll see there are a lot of holes in the reasoning which you may or may not be willing to invest your beliefs into.<p>[1] isbn:0521709849<p>[2] <a href=""http://edge.org/responses/what-scientific-concept-would-improve-everybodys-cognitive-toolkit#descshort_1689"" rel=""nofollow"">http://edge.org/responses/what-scientific-concept-would-impr...</a>",1319480359

There is both a free (ad-based) model and a premium version. Another product offering is for healthcare professionals that allows them to connect with their patients via the dashboard to see all the patient tracking data so the doctor can see an in-depth view of the patient's health and well-being.

Communication through Google docs and Skype is how I roll.<p>You should be highly skilled in the technical aspect but have a mind for product development, user experience, and enjoy the business end of the company. I don't want somebody who simply takes direction but someone who wants to take an active role in building the company - not just the backend.<p>Please be someone who can commit fully to this.

In the case of the minimum wage, society says that labour should have at least a certain price, because that is the morally right thing . . .<p>I'm not sure what you're trying to say in your last paragraph. There is no such thing as a ""morally right"" wage. Wages are just prices set by the market unless they are interfered with.<p>For example, unless you're being paid a government-mandated minimum wage, your wage is set by a mutual agreement between you and your employer. At the time of the agreement, you thought the proposed wage was the best of your options and so did your employer. Had your employer offered you less, then presumably you would have had a better option and would have chosen a different employer. Had you demanded more, presumably your employer would have had a better option and would have chosen a different employee. This is a market wage.<p>The market, all the people together each choosing as they see best among their various options, this is what generally determines all prices including wages. The market is efficient because each actor chooses what is best for them given the choices of the other actors. Whenever the market is intervened with by government-imposed price controls, like minimum wage, the result is inefficiency (waste): the market acts differently than it would if each actor were free to choose.",1319479462

You might create a mini-boomlet right there :-)",1319479254

This isn't the point.<p>I myself don't really know what to think of Wikileaks. I, however, do know that major banks and financial institutions find it perfectly okay for you to send money to all kinds of horrible organisations (say, the Ku Klux Klan, clubs that campaign for underage sex, Westboro Baptist Church, whatever you can come up with, and they probably have a bank account), but not to Wikileaks.<p>I can't imagine how Wikileaks can be considered a so much more evil organisation than Stormfront (<a href=""http://www.stormfront.org/forum/announcement.php?a=63"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.stormfront.org/forum/announcement.php?a=63</a>, all cards accepted) that the first needs to be blocked and the latter does not.<p>It can <i>only</i> be that at least this part of what Wikileaks is saying is true: Major banks and businesses, a scarily small number of organisations that control a large part of the world's financial transactions, want to <i>control to who you give your money</i>. This means that they want to control <i>who gets money and what they do with it</i>. This shit is NONE of their business, and the fact that they can do this without serious legal issues scares the shit out of me.<p>I like to believe that western governments are out to serve their citizens and protect their freedoms, but I cannot explain how that fits with what these banks are doing and how the governments just let it happen. This has absolutely nothing to do with the nature of Wikileaks as an organisation.<p>Really, this fact alone makes me want to send money in an envelope to Wikileaks, despite how ridiculous I thought Cablegate was.<p>Edit: If Wikileaks were a terrorist organisation (blowing up buildings and people and whatnot), I'd understand governments to force a ban. Not banks banning them on their own initiatives, but governments forcing it. If you genuinely feel that Wikileaks is as bad as Al Qaeda and Hamas and the alikes, then I'll understand if you disagree with me, although even then I hope you agree that it should've been a government decree, and not banks solo-piloting their sense of morality. In all other cases, really, I can't wrap my mind around it.",1319479212

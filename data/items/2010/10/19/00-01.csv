The author, in talking about the reusable functions he writes for the kind of tasks he performs is really creating a domain specific language (or fragments of a language) addressing his programming domain, whatever that is. The extra work that would be involved to make this reusable for other people is daunting, primarily because he can be fast and lose in defining his domain for his own personal use (in fact he may not even reflect on the fact he is defining a domain), but for his domain specific language to be useful to others he would have to be far more rigorous in domain definition, with all the attendant documentation, use case testing, etc. This level of effort is way beyond the level of effort require to define an OO framework, for instance.

Last year I decided to pivot my usabilitytest.com business to do exactly what they are doing now. I have been testing / researching / combining different eye-tracking and head-tracking algorithms/APIs etc. I must say for an engineer it was an ultimate challenge. However, after 3 months of working on it I realized this is too much for me and I called it quits. I managed to get eye-tracking working using 2 webcams (one front to monitor head-movement and one small near the eye to monitor eye movement). Unfortunately, because of the nature of eye reflection I had to work in complete darkness and use IR light to illuminate the eye - you can't call it non-intrusive method.<p>So I am very happy that guys at GazeHawk cracked this and launched the service that I really wanted to do and offer people low-cost eyetracking method.",1287447762

Working on GitHub was how I expressed the creativity that I couldn't when I was doing tool support at Powerset.

I was getting a good salary at Powerset.<p>I found my cofounders via local Ruby meetups. I was by myself when I was doing Gravatar and it sucked. Having two cofounders with GitHub has been one of the best decisions I've ever made. They provided additional manpower in the early days when velocity of development matters most, and they acted as a safeguard against bad decisions. It's extremely motivating to have other people that are depending on you to produce great work. I would highly recommend against single founder startups for all of these reasons and a thousand more.<p>Gravatar did become hard to run towards the end. I was spending a few hundred dollars a month on servers and there was no good way to make money with it. It seemed a bit hopeless. I never gave up though. I put in the hours to make it work and eventually sold it to Automattic. To me, that was a success. I created something of value and sold it to someone that had the resources to take it to the next level.<p>It's hard to explain how I judge my startup ideas.

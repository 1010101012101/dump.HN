I think there might be some promise in looking at patterns of entropy, though. What you can't see in that malware post is that very many pieces of malware show very similar layouts of entropy, even if the malware itself is very different. I weeded out similar images so that people could get an idea of the range of layouts, but the 50 visualizations on the blog are a ""condensed"" version of about 400 highly redundant images. Part of this is because different types of malware can still use the same ""packer"" - tools that pack a binary to obfuscate malware and make it hard to detect and reverse engineer. Part of it is just because there are certain techniques that are commonly used. All of this requires more study, but it's interesting.",1326266996

We should have, from the outset, made sure that as long as computers have a physical connection, sending data between them in a standardized way was solid and unbreakable, even with malicious actors. We should have been considering how to design this system so that even if a government that controls a large (say up to 50%) subset of the nodes tries, communications between certain nodes could never be blocked without degrading communications between all blocks and losing the entire functionality. <i>Then</i> we'd be justified in saying that bills like this would destroy the Internet, and nobody would ever even try to pass them.<p>Unfortunately, as thing stand, DNS is a too-easy weak-point in the infrastructure, so unsurprisingly, repressive governments target it as a way of imposing their will on the Internet. With a single point of failure, are we really surprised that governments will pick it out and exploit it? We had many other architectural options, did we perhaps choose one that was just too trusting when put up against the shitty world that we live in?<p>Maybe I'm just naive, perhaps I don't understand the details and subtleties and just assume that a technical solution would be easier to come up with than it really is; I'm not a crypto or networks expert, so maybe the current situation is the only viable one. I'm sure any better solution would not be simple, and I'm sure it would require a lot of research. But in any case, it doesn't exist, so we're pretty much screwed for the moment.<p>Issues like this make me think that dark-net plans are extremely useful, but happening far too late to matter in the real world, where everyone already follows protocols that allow for network-destroying interventions...",1326266185

It was 'communist' in the twisted definition that the state owned the resources and means of production, but that's <i>not</i> Marxism by any stretch - that's state capitalism, which is <i>not</i> the same thing as a planned economy (and neither of which is the the same thing as Marxism).<p>Second, China has not been 'communist' (note the scare quotes) for many years now.<p>Third, there certainly <i>are</i> many people starving in China, just as there are people starving in some part of pretty much any society. I find it entirely believable that there are people who one day's worth of unemployment away from starving in China. For that matter, I would have no trouble believing the same about a capitalist country like the US, or the socialist countries in Europe/South America.",1326265916

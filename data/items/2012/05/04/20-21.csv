The universe did not explode. Somehow life went on.<p>Not really. Crime rates have been going down. Murder rates have been going down. People's lives have been saved, that wouldn't have ""gone on"" before.<p>This is due, in part, to better policing. To what extent this has do to with wiretapping abilities can be debated/analyzed, but a ""somehow life went on"" attitude is pretty much a blunt argument for ""let's never change anything then"", and is therefore irrelevant to the discussion.",1336165167

I don't mean to imply that knowledge accumulated in that way is insufficient in order to be a balls-out startup founder, or have a very high-paying job as a software engineer.<p>I left high school having a <i>lot</i> of programming experience already under my belt, and by then I've read quite a few CS books (the two ""programming pearls"", and the two ""turing omnibus"" books), and since then I've met quite a few people like myself, so a large part of what you are saying resonates with me.<p>However, I would argue that every so often there are problems that one encounters in software engineering for which a haphazard, practical education is insufficient, and only a very rigorous, ""from the ground-up"" education will do. For example, the sort of position that is nowadays advertised as a ""data scientist"", which is a very complex conglomerate of advanced mathematics and computer science.<p>I've <i>never</i> met someone who is a self-educated, no-college-degree data scientist, or audio-video-photo compression expert, or a computational finance guy. I will readily admit my limited sample, and I would be happy if you proved me wrong. Still - what concerns me is that the general view is that formal education is a waste, and what is consistently left aside is that there are <i>many</i> things that one can do for which a haphazard education is simply not enough.",1336165042

Seems to me that the only answer to that is sexism though. For many years it's been held in certain groups that women being the child bearing gender and men being the ""bread winners"" meant that men were somehow above women. In many area's of the world it's much worse then others but regardless you see that everywhere. It would seem to go without saying that that's wrong, but I'm speaking as a man who respects people equally, and leaves it to each individual to prove to me their merit.

It was a part time gig at first, but I sold my retail business in November to focus on it 100%.<p>Everything was going great. Advertisers responded well to the product, and I decided to hire a a designer and go for it. Before I made that jump though, I made sure to get approval from Google to use the Adwords API. I've tried to build businesses on 3rd party APIs before, and I had to be positive Google was cool with what I wanted to make.<p>And they were... Until about 10 weeks ago when my token was revoked without notice. Thankfully my specs started failing, or I might have continued on in bliss for weeks.<p>I immediately contacted the API Token team. We went back and forth for a couple weeks. Turned out my token was revoked for lack of use. Google had also added new minimum requirements for all apps, and they wanted me to document them in my app. No problem! A couple days later I sent them back a 13 page Google Doc with a wireframe for every feature. I was confident this was just a small bump in the road.<p>Then nothing. Not a rejection. Not an email. Nothing.<p>That was two months ago. I've sent three emails to what appears to be a black hole. I've tried being professional. I've tried being funny.

I picked our oldest app as the example, because I frankly expected that after a year it would have died out, and now after 2 years and a year without updates, I would expect it to be making less, not more, than it was a year ago.<p>We've tried other models than the paid app -- for instance a free app that is advertising based.  Went nowhere ($0.30 a month from ads.)  It was unexpectedly features by a ""free apps"" service/site recently and had a massive boost in downloads-- 10k a day for a few days- so we'll see if that does anything.  It was meant to be an experiment to see what a free, well designed app of limited functionality would do in the market.  Other than those big boost days its not getting as many downloads as the paid app- and I think that's simply a factor of it not having as many ratings or the continuous stream of ratings that the older app is getting.<p>Every quarter right now Apple is selling more iOS devices than the total addressable market was at the time our oldest app was originally released.<p>We're getting a smaller proportion of that market, but the tide is rising so fast that we're still earning income from it.",1336164645

3930245,comment,3929660,3929660,43,0,nirvana,,,"This article is silly. The idea that you can't make any money from an App if you aren't in the top of the charts is false.<p>One of my apps has only occasionally and then briefly, broken the top 200 in the US in its CATEGORY. (So nowhere near top 200 overall) and it still reliably pays out every single month.    Further over its lifetime-- about 2 years at this point, the amount it pays every month has gone up, not down.   The experiments we've done show that several things we could do would make it pay even more.<p>For instance, if we'd done a single bit of marketing that might have helped.  The closest thing to ""marketing"" we do is to give promo codes to anyone who asks for one because they want to review the app. (nobody in the USA has yet reviewed the app.)<p>The idea that you need hundreds of thousands of dollars to develop an app is also kinda silly.  A team of two developed our app over the course of a month.  In the intervening 2 years, another month or two has been put into the app.  At this point, the app has gone well more than a year without an update and it is still earning the same income- in fact, its income has gone up in the past several months.<p>There are somethings that you should do to have success though:<p>1. Have a good UI.  The team of 2 was an engineer and a designer and we spent a lot of time on the design.<p>2. Make the app good.  The star rating is a factor in the app doing well.<p>3. Make the app useful.  Have something unique about it... but this doesn't have to be super unique. (our unique value is quite terrible. Paul Graham would throw me out of his office or a YC interview if I pitched him on it... its barely a differentiator, but its enough.)<p>4. Learn from your app and then do another one.  Over time you can build a nice stable of apps and a nice income.<p>5. Update your app regularly.  You experience a sales dip when the app is first updated, but after there are sufficient ratings on the new version the update seems to boost your sales. (or at least ours have, though we stopped updating it to focus on other things.)<p>6. Make your app sticky.  About %80 of the people who buy our app never use it, and that's unfortunate.  But the %20 who do, do for a long time and use it quite a bit.  I think not every app is for everyone. But if your app is going to be useless after awhile, there's not much point (remember the vevuzula?  lots of apps came out to make that sound. wonder how they're selling now?)<p>Hits come and go, and the big money may go to the hits.  But viewing an App as a dividend that pays out every month, in my experience the returns are quite well worth it.<p>Some more points<p>-- Don't spend $100,000 on an app.  Or even $10,000.  IF you count our cost of living, our app cost us $3,400.  We did spend a couple hundred on an outside designer that didn't work out, and about $500 on the app down the road after it was already making good money each month.   That $3,400 we ""spent"" on it-- we get more than half of that back <i>each month</i>.<p>-- If you're a big business expecting to gross $1M a year from an app, then maybe it is a lottery.  I dunno.<p>-- A high price is not a problem.  We sold our app for $3 the first year, then $5 the second.  No real change in income.  We experiment with pricing a bit. You get a lot more downloads at $0.99.  And you can have a big boost to your app by running a sale... but that also affects the amount of ""juice"" apple gives you.<p>-- Since we're not in the charts, our sales come because Apple is recommending our app to people.  Think about that.  The store does work, even if you'd never see us in the store by just browsing.<p>-- I think the idea of focusing on a few apps is a very good one.  don't just throw crap out there and see if it sticks.  That's the biggest problem with the store-- too much crap.  But Apple is getting algorithmically better at figuring out whats crap and what isn't.  Make your app good.  Doesn't have to have all the features you could possibly want in the first version, an MVP is fine, but make it polished.<p>I think that the app store is a huge opportunity for people who would like to work for themselves but aren't in a position to raise funding to do a startup.<p>I think its a lot easier to get a good app discovered than an obscure website.",1336163849

I know this might sound like cleaning the noose we're about to hang someone with, but there are legitimate law enforcement needs, I often think the collective energy from the EFF and others would be better spent not on opposing anything like this, but on advocating and lobbying for strict judicial review and process.<p>For example if we suspected someone was using Craigslist and other internet tools like Skype, to organize and coordinate a human trafficking ring, I would want them to be able to collect evidence akin to a wiretap to investiate the extent of the organization and bring prosecutions.<p>That after-all is the main thing, if the representatives of the people in terms of law enforcement/districts attorneys/federal have a reasonable suspicion that you're committing a crime, we should be allowed to investigate - and for you to challenge any evidence gained in a court. Previous abuses of power are of course troubling, the NSA phone tapping and others comes immediately to mind, which is why I believe energy is best spent on ensuring proper checks and balances and the rule of law - it requires constant work to ensure we have adequate protections for citizens and an adequate ability to prosecute suspected offenders.<p>Just a final point - I want to stress that I do believe the government has and will continue to overstep its bounds with regard to law enforcement, this has been true for time immemorial, and citizens will continue to fight back and push for legal reforms - but simply throwing our hands up and ignoring real, legitimate law enforcement needs seems silly too.

Currently were just one CTO/developer and one CEO/bizdev guy, with a few other folks helping out peripherally.

It makes no claims to the amount of time or effort you'll need to finish it. It's simply a method to learning kanji that tries to make the most out of your memorization capabilities.

In the real world, finding requirements and interpreting specs require these skills. So I will ask questions that can be understood a few ways to gauge the prospective hire's requirements gathering.<p>This can backfire, and requires a bit of fluidity in the interviewer's part -- no cargo cult questions, just open problem solving. In a really good case, me being open to what the interviewee was saying about ambiguity led to a fascinating attempt to solve a different problem than I had originally structured, but we found out we work well together and solved a fun problem. At the same time he showed me his skills, and I showed him my skills. Result: both of us decided working together would be beneficial -- the best possible outcome of an interview (although just as good would be mutually deciding we wouldn't work well together and amicably parting ways).",1336161821

3930096,comment,3928155,3929341,11,0,drostie,,,"Okay, so, let me try to enumerate these.<p>(1) The hardest part of quantum mechanics to understand is intimately tied to our nature as subjects. Quantum mechanics is an entirely deterministic theory about waves in superpositions which even explains how, why, and when it disappears and averages out into classical probabilities. Except it doesn't tell you why we don't see your television as 50% in your bedroom and 50% in your living room. For that we start to invent things like many universes, half of which have a TV in your bedroom and half of which have a TV in your living room -- or Penrose's idea that perhaps some magical interaction not yet observed forces something as large as a TV to ""make up its mind"" due to its gravitational warpings. It's <i>just</i> the fact that your <i>subjective experience</i> doesn't see this TV as half in one place, and half in another, where the wavefunction description fails. The rest is clean, deterministic, and precise.<p>(2) The second hardest part of consciousness to understand is something we basically take for granted in the hardest part of quantum mechanics. Compatibilist theories of free will make you feel warm and fuzzy but they don't really feel like they address the fundamental mystery: How can a deterministic system be said to ""choose"" something when that's a fuzzy airy-fairy notion and the actual outcome was written down in the book of history 13.7 billion years ago, full stop? Why do we feel like we've got a million options open when in fact this is false, false, utterly false, moronically-out-of-touch-with-reality crazy false? But in quantum mechanics, the idea that a quantum system has many options open, and can even ""sniff around"" over the whole space, and that it might make a difference if it does or not -- these things are very acceptable even if you take a deterministic approach to wavefunction collapse. You could maybe in principle go from ""warm and fuzzy but I don't get it"" to ""weird and fuzzy but I think I get it,"" if the brain is intrinsically quantum.<p>(3) The hardest problem of consciousness -- how we reconcile our touchy-feely alive experience of red with a machine's cold unemotional ones and zeros -- is very easy to solve by saying ""we aren't a machine; subjectivity is something more than a program."" In fact, since programs can carry out programs, if consciousness is mechanical we might well ask, how do you know that your brain isn't a different conscious process which happens to be carrying out your own conscious process, and might someday soon get bored and kill you out of its own boredom and desire to live authentically? (This absurdity is also at the heart of Searle's Chinese Rooom argument.) The problem is that machines are such a good model that we have no idea what to replace them with. If quantum systems could really feel in a way that machines really can't, this would solve the problem neatly.<p>(4) One minor problem in consciousness is about how I'm able to hear things as I am seeing them -- multithreading would suggest that we have multiple consciousnesses doing the separate tasks separately; multitasking would suggest that we switch between these things so fast that it gives an illusion that they all come together, but I can't really do both at once. Quantum mechanics offers a tantalizing hint; for example, in a superconductor, two electrons of opposite momentum ""get together"" to form a larger particle called a Cooper pair. (You're advised not to think too hard about how they ""stay together"" with opposite momenta, because It's All Just An Excitation Anyways.) That larger particle can even do something which electrons never can -- it can form a Bose-Einstein condensate: it can conduct current without resistance.<p>(5) Everybody who watches Star Trek wonders what would happen if someone accidentally forgot to dematerialize you before re-materializing you down on the planet -- which one would be the right ""you""? Quantum systems cannot be cloned in this way. The closest we can get is to identically prepare a system -- i.e. take another baby with the same genetic code and give it all of the same life experiences, and kill the ones who don't make the same choices in the same order. Without one of those, you can't clone an arbitrary unknown system into two copies without measuring it and thus forcing it into a classical state. If consciousness is quantum, then the classical state is dead. But if consciousness is just a program, then we're faced with a much scarier situation: in the transporter, you will actually die, but that's okay, because we'll create an impostor who will sleep with your wife for you -- in other words, it's okay because <i>we'll never know the difference</i>, and <i>you'll be dead</i>.",1336161794

But hey, don't let the facts get in the way of your persecution complex.""<p>Neither of your two posts contain any argument, only a (still unsupported) assertion about what the constitution says, and assertions of negative characteristics about me.<p>Your citation of Article 1, section 8, is an evasion on your part, as it shows that the constitution only authorizes laws to execute ""the foregoing Powers"". Or in short, Article 1, section 8 proves my claim that the government only has the legal power in the constitution as enumerated by the enumerated powers.  You haven't shown the existence of this power either in the enumerated powers clause or elsewhere (in the amendments), and thus you haven't actually addressed my claim at all.<p>Article 2, section 3, merely requires the president to adhere to the requirements of these enumerated powers. Which is actually further support for my claim, not an undermining of it.<p>The fact is that these enumerated powers are very specific: ""To establish Post Offices and Post Roads;"" shows that they are not so broad as to fit anything not mentioned in between the cracks. You can't say the government has the power to establish an Airline and Airports and Air Routes based on that enumeration, for instance.<p>You blithely quote the word ""powers"" but ignore that until you show where the constitution grants the power to maintain a standing police force, you haven't even addressed my argument.<p>You can't make an argument on the points. You have twice pretended like there's an argument to be made, and in the second time, effectively evaded the point and quoted irrelevancies as if it were an argument.  I must conclude that you have no argument to make, which explains why you choose personal attack instead.   Well, I'm done. You can post whatever you want to try and make me look bad. I don't are.  Your doing so only serves to prove my point.  Even if you managed to find an actual quote in the constitution that  rebuts me completely, your twice choosing to engage in ad hominem rather than debate still means you lost.<p>So, I'm done.  The sad thing is, this is typical of the intolerance for differing perspectives that is exhibited on Hacker News.  I was making point where we had common ground-- but you don't care about that. You simply cannot tolerate the existence of someone who can articulate a different perspective.  And so you attacked me.<p>I suspect people like you and the down vote brigade are a large reason why hacker news has become somewhat of a monoculture.",1336161745

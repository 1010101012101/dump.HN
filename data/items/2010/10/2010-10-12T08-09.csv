1782708,comment,1781707,1781707,0,0,edanm,,,"The feeling here seems to be that ""for-loop tricks"" are not a good idea, mainly because of readability. I disagree. I'm talking about the ""idea"" of for-loop tricks, not the specific ones shown in the article.<p>For-loops are used in really limited ways, but they <i>should</i> be used much more often. Programmer <i>should</i> be better versed in how for loops work, the fact that you can add multiple expressions between each semi-color (;), etc. The reason is, for-loops are the most <i>readable</i> constructs for looping. Here's why:<p>For-loops are the one loop construct which give you all the information about the looping at once. Used smartly, you can read the first line of the for-loop, and discover everything that the programmer would like to do, that has to do with the looping.<p>For example, adding two variables to be incremented in a for-loop is trivial: for (int i=0, int b=10; i==10; i++,b++)<p>This can also be done outside of the for-loop declaration, e.g. as the first line inside the for-loop. However, for smart programmers, this signals, to me, that ""b"" is another variable having to do with the loop that I would like incremented each time. In other words, it gives me more info.<p>Other good uses can include checking two conditions, checking conditions with side-effects (e.g. instead of i++, use word=read_word_from_file()), etc. Lots of people are uncomfortable with these in a for-loop, but I maintain that's the best construct for these kinds of things, since it gives you all the info you need to understand the loop at one point only.",1286871815

For example, it's very hard to tell when someone replies to you, which means I would just drop out of conversations if they didn't appear on my ""threads"" page. (Although there is a solution nowadays, notifo). HN also has problem with the voting, like being unable to change votes, etc.<p>That said, HN still rocks. Does the incredibly limited UI have anything to do with it? I don't know. But I wouldn't mess around with HN too much: why mess with something that works?",1286870916

1782679,comment,1780058,1782086,0,0,jforman,,,"Technically evolution does not require survival of the fittest or mutation.  Evolution is merely the change in allelic frequency in a population over time.<p>Without selective pressure (i.e., ""survival of the fittest"") you can still have evolution via drift, the founder effect, etc.  Drift is a very important source of evolution in a lot of situations (during my PhD I studied how a source of seeming drift in the coding regions of genes was actually caused by selective pressure in some cases).<p>Without mutation a population can still evolve, too - for example, if a disease struck and there was no mutation, an allele that protected against the disease would quickly dominate the population.  This is a much more pedantic thing to point out (on my part), though, since every stretch of every organism's DNA mutates.  The different mutation rates of viruses, bacteria, and humans due to replication errors (and the resulting effect on evolution) is a pretty fascinating topic, though.",1286870754

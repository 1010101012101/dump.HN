Perhaps a little ignorant of some legal details of the court orders, but someone who has done a bit more than &quot;toyed around&quot; with SMTP. In fact, <i>obviously</i> so -- making your assertions about his intelligence appear more ideologically motivated than reasonable.<p>The system design for VFEmail is apparently available here: <a href=""https://www.vfemail.net/design.php"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.vfemail.net/design.php</a><p>It appears to have occurred to him to think about how to build custom email systems with SMTP support.<p>The privacy FAQ for VFEmail is here: <a href=""https://www.vfemail.net/privacyandsecurity.php"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.vfemail.net/privacyandsecurity.php</a><p>It&#x27;s not true that he claims on the blog that VFEmail is a secure service in the same sense that Lavabit claimed to be, and his FAQ answers for people concerned about privacy are essentially:<p>1) Use their web interface to PGP. He&#x27;s transparent about the fact that with this option your encrypted email could be read, if your password were intercepted.<p>2) Better yet use client side PGP.<p>> ...using the Webmail interface for PGP stores your private key on the server, and requires you to send your key password to VFEmail. That subjects your encryption key to interception by a third party.<p>> ... Most importantly - Use PGP with your own email client. You should store your key on your device(s), under your control. Again, illegal access by a 3rd party could compromise your key, so be very careful of what you open and where you surf.<p>Lavabit marketed a claim to be so secure that even their administrators couldn&#x27;t read your email. This was untrue, and curious in juxtaposition to the spam/content filtering features it had. VFEmail is pretty upfront -- unless you&#x27;re encrypting everything client side, someone can read it.<p>So basically if one reads beyond the first few paragraph, or visits the email service that he &quot;claims&quot; to own, it&#x27;s clear that all these &quot;he&#x27;s a moron, has only toyed around with email, doesn&#x27;t understand Lavabit&#x27;s encryption, etc.&quot; claims being made are simply character assassination.<p>Furthermore, the FBI didn&#x27;t &quot;call&quot; or &quot;ask for&quot; the pen register or SSL keys.

I therefore use an algorithm in my head to construct the password. Say I want to create an account for yahoo.com. I always use the same user name. For the password, I apply my &quot;algorithm&quot; to the service URL. Eg. my algorithm could be &quot;reverse the first five letters of the URL, make the now last char upper case and append &#x27;1337!&#x27;&quot;. So in the Yahoo example, my password would be &#x27;oohaY1337!&#x27;. For gmail.com, it would be &#x27;liamG1337!&#x27;, etc. This way, I get unique passwords for each site, that are at the same time easy to remember.\n[It goes without saying that I am using a different algoritm than the above.]",1391855758

7200871,comment,7195889,7196903,2,0,waveman2,,,"Two comments<p>1. Machine learning is moving more and more towards indirect programming i.e. you program the computer with a learning algorithm and let it work out what to do. Google reinforcement learning, or machine learning. This greatly reduces the programming bottleneck.<p>2. People underestimate how much processing power the human brain has. Think 100,000,000,000 neurons, each with 1,000 active connections on average and perhaps 10,000 latent connections (which are being updated via Hebbian learning). The connections (axons and dendrites) are the active processing units. The cycle time is .01 seconds or so. Only the very largest computers are anywhere near this processing power (~10^16 operations/second). My current desktop is about 10,000 times less powerful. Now imagine trying to build a tractor with a 1/100 horsepower motor - such a difference is beyond being a gap, it is a qualitative difference.<p>Given the limited processing power available it is amazing computers can do what they can.

Paid off my student debt, had a couple of very nice vacations. By the time the rest vested, they were underwater.<p>Here&#x27;s the kicker: employee #1 was a good friend of mine and we did a show-me-yours-show-you-mine. He got exactly the same as I had.

Where shall I start? Well, there&#x27;s one obvious starting point -- the fact that the theory of evolution models stable populations mathematically:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function</a><p>> ... even if you can actually do that, give a stable species, the fact is that humans follow a pattern of massive expansion followed by large die-offs, rinse and repeat.<p>You just answered your own question. From the standpoint of natural selection there&#x27;s no difference between a species whose numbers don&#x27;t change, and one whose numbers fluctuate up and down around a maximum defined by its environment.<p>In any case, apart from humans there are thousands of species whose numbers are limited by their environments, and natural selection continues to choose which members of that species survive, based on the changing nature of the environment. This is evolution 101.<p>> Still a fan ?<p>What are you going on about? Do you or do you not want to understand evolution? You have already accepted, and given examples of, the idea that natural selection applies to growing populations and declining populations -- all you need to do now is fill in the blank space lying between the two.",1391854198

Consider the chasm that separates science and religion -- the scientist&#x27;s default outlook is that ideas are assumed to be false until there&#x27;s supporting evidence. The religious believer&#x27;s default outlook is that ideas are assumed to be true until evidence proves them false (and some believers refuse to examine any evidence) -- exactly the opposite outlook. This can&#x27;t be waved away, and no meaningful discussion can begin until the chasm is bridged.<p>Until 1600, religion solved the science problem by killing all the scientists. Since then, it has solved the problem by ignoring science, even while living in a world increasingly defined by science and scientific thinking.

3197869,comment,3196377,3197731,1,0,dman,,,"I recently started teaching technical subjects and here are some points from the other side of the classroom\na) Every class has outliers on either side of the performance spectrum and teaching is a resource allocation problem on part of the teachers time on how to deliver maximal benefit to the students at large. \nb) The number of people who are simultaneously entertaining, inspiring and educational is very few. Look around you and shortlist the number of people whom you consider extremely knowledgeable about some subject, now remove from that list the number of people who have great people skills. Of course people skills can be improved over time but it takes real effort and time. \nc) As a teacher the best one can do while teaching challenging material is spend time in the first part of a lecture developing the motivation for getting students interested. Usually that leaves little time for interactivity in the latter part of the lesson.\nd) Classes where students ask no questions are very hard to make interesting. When this is happening your teacher is probably feeling like a comic doing an act where no one is laughing. Next time youre stuck in a class which seems overly dull try to help out your teacher by asking intelligent questions. \ne) In some challenging material there is simply not enough time to do it justice. In those cases the best a teacher can do is do a non interactive session where they do a brain dump hoping that students will be motivated enough to follow up with the material in their own time.\nf) There is also the philosophical question about who gets to teach - \n1) someone who is at the pinnacle of their field and hence can earn a livelihood by teaching people so that they can contribute with original research.\n2) someone who is a great educator.<p>g) I think truly great teachers occur with the same frequency as truly great comics because both fields have something in common.",1320443930

WalMart has deep connections with their suppliers, requiring suppliers to hand over financial records, dictating factory processes, and demanding yearly cost reduction.<p>The difference (and it is the major difference) is that Apple focuses their relationships with suppliers on quality of process and availability by locking up supply years ahead of time. WalMart just focuses on cost reduction.<p>The innovation is that Apple willing to pay high upfront costs years in advance to design efficient manufacturing processes so that later it would be able to get both cheaper component rates and a guaranteed supply.  Jonathan Ive has said that most of his time is spent designing processes rather than products.

3197794,comment,3196137,3197628,1,0,ScottBurson,,,"> Recognising the problem is often the innovation.<p>It can be an innovation, but it can be very hard for the PTO to tell just how much of an innovation it is.  What happens a lot, I believe, is that the emergence of a new technology creates new possibilities, but the actual application of the technology to those possibilities raises certain problems that have to be solved.  The existence of those problems is not obvious in advance of the new technology, but once people have it in front of them and start to play around with it, it starts to become more and more likely that someone will think of those problems.  The evidence for this is the not infrequent occurrence of simultaneous or near-simultaneous invention.<p>So while recognizing the problem might be an innovation, it might be an almost inevitable innovation.  Furthermore, much of the credit might arguably belong to the enabling technology that made a solution possible, and to the industry that developed and commercialized that technology.<p>To make an extreme simile, one could say the Internet is like the technology to allow us to colonize the moon, and so many of these software patents are like people booking trips to the moon, arriving, and then staking a land claim.  It wasn't very much their own intrepid exploration that made it possible for them to stake that claim; there might have been a little of that, but mostly they're dependent on the massive effort, by an entire industry, that made it possible for them to get there in the first place.  So the policy question is, have they really contributed so much that we should reward them with that land claim?",1320442603

We started with easy problems that had nothing to do with calculus like proving that 1/sqrt(3) is irrational, went into epsilon-delta proofs for limits, and continued on to showing that the Dirichlet function is discontinuous everywhere.  I don't think we evaluated a single integral in that class.<p>A strange feature of the class was that the weeks where we studied derivatives were a lot harder than the weeks when we studied integrals.  Although derivatives are a lot easier to evaluate than integrals, it's a lot harder to prove that they exist.  Most of our problems were proving the existence of derivatives and integrals, not evaluating them, so it was a weird inversion in what is normally considered difficult in calculus.<p>If you want a sample of the problems, here's one of the problem sets from this year's class:<p><a href=""http://www.math.caltech.edu/%7E2011-12/1term/ma001a1/homework/11Ma1a1Hw3.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.math.caltech.edu/%7E2011-12/1term/ma001a1/homewor...</a>",1320441989

Advertising by its nature is more predictable, it doesn't have long term, world changing impact. The ultimate problem of selling is easy enough to crack, even if a campaign flops you try again. They're satisfied with their efficiency so no need to invest in neuroscience yet.<p>In software/science/math there is more variety, some problems are hard to crack. There is also more motivation to improve efficiency by orders of magnitude, to disrupt the market, like Google/Facebook do. Ad agencies don't develop new tech, only adapt to it, so they're vulnerable to obsolescence. At some point advances in neuroscience, behavioral economics and tech will outpace the rate at which most agencies can adapt.<p>There are agencies that spend crazy hours polishing up their work, or more often mismanaging.

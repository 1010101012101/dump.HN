What needs to happen is that money paid needs to be spent - on toast or anything really - rather than being further invested. By spending, money moves around the system, gets taxed, gets <i>redistributed</i> between everyone relatively fairly. If tech workers earn more than they can reasonably spend then they end up investing it in houses and companies, meaning the money stays with the few and pushes the poles apart - the poor get poorer and the rich get richer.

It was filled with thousands of people, going up and down the escalators, standing at the corners, going in and out of the front entrance in a constant stream both ways – yet nothing was being bought or sold. I checked this by standing at the entrance for half an hour. The people coming out were carrying no more than the people entering. Their shopping bags contained as much, or as little, when they left as when they entered. In some cases, I recognised people coming out as those who had gone in a few minutes before, only to see them re-entering the store almost immediately. And I watched a hardware counter for fifteen minutes. There were perhaps twenty people standing at it; there were two assistants behind the counter, but they paid no attention to the ‘customers’. The latter and the assistants stared past each other in a straight line, neither moving nor speaking.</i><p>...snip...<p><i>I also followed a few people around at random, as discreetly as I could. Some were occupied in ceaselessly going up and down the escalators; others wandered from counter to counter, spending a few minutes at each before moving on. They did not inspect the merchandise; they moved as listlessly as illiterates might, condemned to spend the day among the shelves of a library. I did not know whether to laugh or explode with anger or weep. But I knew I was seeing one of the most extraordinary sights of the twentieth century.</i><p>[1] <a href""http://www.skepticaldoctor.com/2010/01/15/classic-dalrymple-the-wilder-shores-of-marx-excerpt-1991"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.skepticaldoctor.com/2010/01/15/classic-dalrymple-...</a>",1389860618

And as such, it didn&#x27;t have a pre-existing language community to point out the shortcomings of the JS implementation.  The problem with most compile-to-JS languages is that you never get the semantics exactly right; things like float semantics, string encodings, prototype chains etc. usually make the JS version just different enough to hold surprises for programmers used to the server-side implementation, which defeats the purpose of using the same language for both (Rhino had the same problem, which is why it took V8 before Node could really catch on).

6911695,comment,6911031,6911031,1,0,beloch,,,"Here are a couple of itches for academics that Latex scratches:<p>1. <i>Templates, so you don&#x27;t have to control how everything looks:</i> If you&#x27;re writing a paper, you usually target a specific journal (and retarget later if rejected).  If you download that journal&#x27;s templates you can work on a version of the paper that looks very close to how it will be published.  You can also submit a preprint to arxiv so it will be available to others in a close-to-final form while it goes through the (sometimes lengthy) peer-review process.<p>2. <i>Fine control when you need it:</i> While templates allow latex users to primarily worry about content rather than fiddling with appearances, there are still very fine controls in Latex for sweating the fine-details, and believe me, there are plenty of those that academics sweat over.  There are a lot of little things that make your text robust against the tyrannies of the template.  For example, say you write &quot;For blah blah blah, see Figure 1.&quot; in your text.  Latex might decide to start a new line after &quot;Figure&quot;, leaving &quot;1.&quot; starting the next line.  Awkward!  Rewrite this as &quot;Figure~1&quot; and Latex will not insert a newline there. If you get into the habit of doing that all the time, and many other things, you will spend a lot less time playing whack-a-mole with things that wind up looking funny.  When you get good, you truly only have to worry about content.<p>This war between not having to control appearance and controlling it utterly when it matters makes Latex both very powerful and very frustrating to newcomers. Proficiency delivers freedom to worry only about content, which is what academics <i>really</i> want.<p>If HTML+etc is to be an alternative to latex, those templates need to be out there. Otherwise it&#x27;s a chicken and the egg problem. Nobody has time to use HTML because it would mean developing a new template to meet their target journal&#x27;s spec&#x27;s and convincing them to accept that format, so nobody ever develops a template.  Journals won&#x27;t waste time developing templates or altering their system to accept HTML documents unless submitters are interested in submitting via that route.  If you truly think you&#x27;ve found a superior alternative to Latex, it is up to you to pick a journal, develop templates that match their format, and get them out there so people can try them.",1387151673

Your savings and spending decisions affect the size of the economy.<p>Now, from an individual household perspective, your spending is only a drop in the bucket. It is small compared to the size of the economy, and it is small compared to the revenue of any individual firm. Any feedback effect your behavior may have is a rounding error compared to the sum of the effects of everybody else&#x27;s behaviours. Therefore, it is reasonable to disregard the feedback effects when you make individual decisions.<p>However, when you evaluate the economy <i>as a whole</i>, there is nobody else and the feedback effects are suddenly the dominant term.

Shareholder lawsuits typically aim to show a breach of duty on the part of a corporate officer or board member, which is a completely different standard than the one you lay out.  A violation of the law is unnecessary.  It would be legal for Mark Zuckerberg to use his voting shares to sell Facebook to IBM for a dollar, but doing so would be a breach of his fiduciary duty to shareholders.  There is also no notion of a &quot;conviction&quot;, it is a civil suit.<p>In particular it is totally possible to argue that IBM directors / officers were in fact acting in the best interests of US national security, but not their shareholders, the same way that the board of Lockheed would be in breach of their fiduciary duty if they started giving away stealth fighters for free.",1387151577

6911684,comment,6910687,6911542,7,0,rst,,,"Thanks for the close reading.  I guess it depends what you think &quot;no domestic intercepts&quot; excludes, and how much you believe that everyone in the NSA follows the rules.  Even if most of them do, a few have the tools to become a very big problem --- and the rest of the organization wouldn&#x27;t necessarily know, since in an organization like the NSA, people aren&#x27;t <i>supposed</i> to know what&#x27;s happening in the office down the hall.<p>To start with the scope of what&#x27;s available: it almost certainly includes data on US persons &quot;incidentally&quot; acquired in taps on an authorized target.

You can do this explicitly using existential types.<p>(2) Functions are a little weird since (->) is a profunctor and thus is contravariant in the first argument and covariant in the second. Thus, using the coercion above you&#x27;d note that any function where `forall x . A x => x` is an input may be replaced by `forall x . B x => x` and when it&#x27;s an output then the replacement goes the other way.<p>(3) fromIntegral is a bad example because it relies on the specific functions in the typeclasses Integral and Num--- it&#x27;s just `fromIntegral . toIntegral`.<p>I think this kind of stuff is a kind of subtyping.

It is certainly not considered a valid mathematical result.<p>For biology, a 1 sigma result is considered pretty good. And due to experimental restrictions, this is actually more strict than medicine requires.<p>Many science disciplines work with known-wrong theories. Civil engineering for example, works with pre-Newtonian mechanics (not even &quot;turtle mechanics&quot; : in the best simulations a building stands on ground, which stands on a plate which is magically suspended in a &quot;downward&quot; gravity field, not on a planet).<p>The idea of &quot;this is the standard of proof for &#x27;science&#x27;&quot; is a nice one, but it doesn&#x27;t exist in any reasonable sense. Only the utilitarian definition sticks : we have 100 standards of proof, and if the theory works (or gets enough money if your cynical) we&#x27;ll find the standard of proof that allows us to call it science.<p>Furthermore, there are several inconsistencies in the science underpinning, for example, the Higgs boson discovery. We do not actually have rigorous proofs for constructing even natural numbers by the standards of first-order logic. And second order logic has paradoxes that stand unresolved (there is a lot of research to find something &quot;more flexible&quot; than first-order logic, but stricter than second-order that works, but this research has been going on for more than a century and there are no really good candidates, only really bad ones like the famous failure of the Choice axiom)<p>The standard model doesn&#x27;t even contain gravity, so if you&#x27;re being pedantic you could drop a pen from your desk and claim, correctly, that you&#x27;ve just falsified the entire standard model, or at least proven it&#x27;s incompleteness.<p>Less pedantically in the physics itself there is the massive open question. The Higgs field only causes inertia, not gravity. Yet the measure of interaction with the Higgs field of any object we&#x27;ve ever measured matches exactly the value we&#x27;ve got for that same object&#x27;s gravitic interactions.

Furthermore, if it came from divine inspiration, there&#x27;s a glaring omission : why doesn&#x27;t it mention the irrational nature of Pi ? Otherwise even a 100 digit approximation would lead any reasonable reader to a wrong conclusion. In this case to nothing better than an Indian version of this : <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pi_Bill\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pi_Bill</a>.<p>Every &quot;real&quot; mathematical book on Pi contains three proofs. First that it is irrational (that you can only approximate Pi, it doesn&#x27;t have any finite representation), that some method of series expansion approximates Pi, and that said series converges. Without these 3 bits of data you don&#x27;t know what Pi is. The actual value of Pi is almost inconsequential, and can be trivially measured using a rope and a measuring stick by a first grader to an accuracy of at least 10 digits. Alternatively you could calculate without an explicit value, like the ancient Greeks did.<p>Furthermore there&#x27;s nothing special about this. When it comes to written references to the value of Pi, there are documents going back ~4000 years (E.g. the Rhynd papyrus). If you accept buildings that could not have been constructed without an approximation of Pi&#x27;s value, then we can go back 6000 years before we really get into trouble. If you accept the reasoning that pyramids which are the &quot;internal&quot; pyramid of a ball shape could not have been a coincidence, knowledge of pi (which is necessary to construct such a shape) goes back nearly 10000 years.",1387150286

I clearly remember my father buying dollars after getting his paycheck. Investment-wise it was a bad idea, but all people wanted was some sense of safety. When hyperinflation finally came to an end and I knew that my lunch at school would cost the same thing every week (instead of costing 20% more every Monday!), people started spending/selling their dollars.<p>The problem of BTC now is a problem of trust. And this lack of trust is due to the crazy volatility, not its deflationary nature. So, it is a chicken-and-egg problem.

Don&#x27;t allow anything else to interrupt you nor do any interleaving with other activities. For example, you decide to focus between 7-11am, then do something else and come back between 3pm-7pm or any other time suitable to you. Don&#x27;t slack off when you have to think, manage your weaknesses.<p>I found that this does wonders to my productivity. Often during the breaks/sleep I get excellent ideas and have enough power to carry them out. I also suddenly have a plenty of time when I can focus on my hobbies (a lot of them), persons I like to be with and on running my own business on the side.<p>There was some research in Germany comparing the lives of virtuoso pianists with average ones - the only difference was the virtuosos got completely immersed in their practice twice a day, whereas the average ones interleaved all kinds of activities with their practice.<p>This is coming from a person that prepared some of the most challenging and business-differentiating algorithms for a start up in the computer graphics area (mostly advanced geometry, SIGGRAPH Pioneer member), and still manages to dedicate time to fashion photography, making hyperlapse movies, composing electronic music, playing piano, fiddling with interesting technology like drones, writing training materials and e-books, place at the top 1% of multiple pilot MOOC courses and loves to socialize.<p>If you need to ask anything, let me know, I would be more than happy explain to you my recent nomad lifestyle!

This will be the &quot;interactive television&quot; of the future.<p>If you haven&#x27;t noticed, it is not easy is it to turn an iPad into a router/server.  Perhaps it was not meant to be.   It is an &quot;interactive TV&quot;, for sharing and consuming content.  These type of devices are not under the control of users; they are ultimatly controlled by large corporate interests, in the same way that TV is the medium of government and large corporations.  That is not &quot;revolutionary&quot;, just business as usual.<p>As such, I posit that it is another computer -- the computer that retrieves data from the internet and sends the content to your TV-like device -- that is the most interesting, and hence the most &quot;revolutionary&quot;.  That is your router/server.\nThe OP, a programmer, calls it &quot;one of [his] best hacks.&quot;<p>This I believe is the &quot;PC&quot; of the future.  The &quot;PC&quot; was at one time a revolutionary device that brought the power of computers, once reserved only for those who could purchase and administer mainframes, to the home and business.  Where would Apple, Google if not for the PC revolution?<p>I believe the home router/server (not your beautiful form factor, high priced device) is, going forward, the &quot;PC&quot; of the future.  This is the device that you can program for free, that can run open source software, including an open source OS of your choice, that you the user can fully control, and where real innovation can occur.  This is where the &quot;PC revolution&quot; can continue.<p>The OP says he does not see why there should be a separation between programming and administration (e.g., a subset of programming that, allong with basic networking know-how, allows the user to install and configure her own &quot;server&quot; at home).<p>As a user, if I could only master one and had to choose between the two, I&#x27;d pick administration over programming.  This is because I feel it is more useful to me as a user (like the OP, &quot;one of my best hacks&quot;).  As such, I am biased toward administration and believe if there is to be another &quot;PC revolution&quot; I believe it should be focused on the home server/router and, if so, must be lead by those who can at least administer computers performing these crucial functions.",1387149611

If you find that a struggle, it&#x27;s generally suggesting that the work isn&#x27;t engaging enough.<p>- Don&#x27;t work weekends, or at least every weekend.  You&#x27;ll soon start to resent the personal time lost if ever you felt the need for a career change.<p>- Make sure you can get out the house.  I rent a desk in a converted chapel in a cemetery and absolutely love going to work.<p>- If you spent time on weekends coding, then it suggests coding is a hobby as well as a job.  You may have side projects or just want to learn something new.  Don&#x27;t sacrifice this time for your day job.  It&#x27;s probably one of the rare qualities that actually makes you good at what you do.<p>- An hour of work outside of 9-5 is usually preceded with an hour of &quot;I must sit down and do some work&quot; followed by an hour of &quot;what was it I should do now that I stopped working&quot; - so expect a 3 hour mental drain for work during your time off.<p>- Do you want to be doing this in 5 to 10 years time?  If not, what do you want to do instead, then do that.<p>Your schedule may work for you, but just keep a look out for other areas of your life being affected and recognise the source.

OOP is used blindly as some kind of magic that is expected to produce a good system by itself. More objects, more abstraction is not always good.

What will you do when some guy encapsulates his code in i class as into a black box, but then leaves the company, leaving the class unmaintained? You will still need to deal with it, you will still need to debug through it. And the added levels of abstraction will make it more uncertain where the problem lies. As i&#x27;ve seen recently on a project, the blind enforcing of various OOP principles was responsible for the messy code, i would say 90% of code was in-house made framework/boilerplate, and the important parts were scattered around that. I&#x27;m only fan of one programming principle, and that&#x27;s KISS. Or more precisely i believe that: when you can express something with the programming language directly, don&#x27;t build abstractions on top of the language to express that thing.

This can be re-stated that as the ratio of money to goods declines, so too will the purchase of goods.<p>The ratio of money to a specific good declining can happen in one of two ways.  Either<p>1) the currency as a whole appreciates in value relative to everything in the economy (usually called &quot;deflation&quot;) or<p>2) the good becomes cheaper to extract, manufacture, grow or otherwise produce which then allows business to price it less expensively<p>In either case 1 or 2 the ratio of money to a good has decreased.  We normally would say it has &quot;gotten cheaper&quot;<p>Computers are a good which has gotten cheaper in real terms and nominal terms and especially in absolute terms.  A desktop computer used to cost $2000 or more for anything decent (adjusted for inflation perhaps $5000 or more), today a quite respectable laptop can be purchased for $800 which has hundreds if not thousands of times the capability of the $2000 machine from 20 years ago.<p>The world as it exists today does have a computer industry, in fact it&#x27;s huge.

The dollar is not naturally inflationary. Instead, the fed allows for a controlled amount of inflation every year to encourage spending. Automatically managed currencies like you discuss still suffer from inflexibility—as our understanding of monetary economics adjusts, or qualities of the economy change (as with the change in velocity of money during the 80&#x27;s-90&#x27;s), it would be difficult to adjust the algorithm to better stabilize the money supply.<p>More importantly, cryptocurrencies are region agnostic. I take it you learned about optimal currency area in your studies? Any arbitrary threshold would risk having inconsistent effects in different places.

E.g. you happily install LaTeX in your Linux thinking everything will work, but no, turns out you still need lots of separate packages.  Why not have it be one standardized bundle?<p>You need to run its compiler twice over the document, the first pass will not generate a proper TOC yet. This feels so hacky and dated to me. Make it produce final output at once?<p>Some systems will support jpg but not png. Others will support jpg but not png. (At some stage in between the conversion of the latex into something readable/printable). Put all modern image formats in the core standard please.<p>It hardly supports correct line-breaks if your document has two languages.<p>Some pipelines that turn latex into a PDF somehow give the PDF a font that looks very garbled when printed. I know this is not latex&#x27; fault, but, indirectly it does and a solution must be found so that we are guaranteed to have a readable paper when printed out.<p>And the fact that compiling tex to pdf or ps somehow also seems to involve intermediate dvi files. Just makes it seem sloppy. Why not have a set of compiler that go from tex to whatever you want in one smooth go?",1387148467

6347494,comment,6346933,6346933,3,0,crassus,,,"I disagree with the dichotomy between living a &quot;default life&quot; and being happy[1]. Maybe in America where society is so atomized and culture is so dead this is true, but this is not true everywhere. It is an American sickness that says you must work your way to happiness, that happiness comes at the end of a chain of accomplishments.<p>What more is needed to be happy but friends, family, and enough to get by? Honestly, I think living in a culture with a strong sense of itself and its purpose is more important than any of the author&#x27;s points, but people living in America wouldn&#x27;t know what that feels like.<p>All of what makes America terrible and most of what makes it successful is the puritan ancestry of its institutions. More and more Americans are skipping having families. Why? Because it would interfere with their career. Translated: <i>they want to work more</i>. In an effort to work their way into heaven, they ignore heaven&#x27;s gifts.<p>I know a lot of people that follow the author&#x27;s advice, or try to (I can guess which cultural milieu this is coming from). They are all stressed out trying to save the world or something and nervous about failing (commandment number 3 is like saying &quot;don&#x27;t get cold in the winter&quot;).<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.theonion.com/articles/unambitious-loser-with-happy-fulfilling-life-still,33233/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theonion.com/articles/unambitious-loser-with-happ...</a>",1378605463

Nobody that deals with the entity should care whether it is a corporation or an LLC or Limited Partnership. There are giant multi-billion dollar LLCs, typically  divisions of some parent corporation. LLC simplicity makes it easy for LLCs to be divisions of a parent corporation.<p>Why Delaware? \nYour own state&#x27;s corporation laws are good enough unless you&#x27;re already gigantic or going public, or already are in Delaware, or someone is specifically demanding it from you, which I strongly doubt. Plenty of gigantic, or public companies do not incorporate in Delaware. Why do you need to have a foreign-state incorporation rather than your own state? Make it simple and less expensive, and use local-state incorporation and local lawyers that are familiar with their own state&#x27;s run-of the mill corporate laws. Delaware is not that special.<p>A Limited Liability Company form of entity can be simple to operate, but they are not flexible in having the ability to have multiple classes of investments by others.<p>If you&#x27;re the only person, or one of several individual partners, and capital from other people is not a concern, then, sure, an LLC may work for you. Later on, if you have a partner-founder depart, and want to issue a different category of capital representation for him/her upon departure (&quot;units&quot; in LLC speak), you can&#x27;t, so LLCs are not so good at transitions either. Creating a vesting process  may also be cumbersome or not possible. Further, if you grow and need capital, you&#x27;ll end up becoming a C corporation, to be able to have multiple classes of ownership shares.<p>C Corporations vs. S Corporations: these are elections that are made via a filing with the US Internal Revenue Service.  The S Corp has limitations on what it may do and and still maintain its status as an S corp for tax purposes, instead of the default C corporation status.<p>If you are seeking investments or venture funding:  \nVCs and investors prefer C corporations: the investor will not be taxed on net income as they would with an S Corp. \nThe C corp. can issue convertible preferred stock, which is typical structure for a venture capital investment.  S corporations can only issue one class of stock, so that also is typically a deal stopper for investors.<p>Venture Capital funders don&#x27;t like LLCs or S Corporations for the above reasons, and will decline to participate, unless the entity converts to a C corporation.",1378604181

Linux is inward focused: a monolithic kernel designed to serve as a pleasant base for anything running under it.<p>There are probably near a thousand different Node.js projects each implementing some kind of coordination layer between Node.js processes (ex: <a href=""https://github.com/amino/amino"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/amino/amino</a>) and similar efforts abound on for all other applications to be coded against (Hazelcast, Hadoop, &c). Why?<p>It&#x27;s all done as application framework level because the Linux operating system&#x27;s design space is sitting on a box and running. The fanciest interconnect you&#x27;re going to get is when you first modprobe in USB-IP (allows network control of a usb peripheral). It&#x27;s downhill, and back to writing applications if you want to push on.<p>Linux is definitely quite alright. We&#x27;re fine with Hadoop, running on the JVM, running on Linux. We were delighted to have a desktop Unix, to have X running- the never ending parade of &quot;year of the linux desktop&quot; stories, year after year. Linux arose when we wanted better ways to run things on a box, and most problems fit on a box. Linux was what we wanted, took care of the pressing matter of running a single box, and it was good at that, whereas when it and Plan9 were in their early days, it was a harsh and hostile landscape and we weren&#x27;t good at working within the confines of the box.<p>Plan9 has always been for those cases where you abutted the constraints of the box, and wanted to think more openly more broadly about the problems about us- and plan9 was for those who wanted to reap solutions that could scale and reach out in a common interoperable serviceable way. It was ahead of it&#x27;s time, and we couldn&#x27;t picture the use of a fabric that would let the boxes work together, in part because boxes were still rapidly individually advancing from the very crude, hard to use machines of the mainframe days into things we could begin to use. Thanks Linux for getting us so far, but I tend towards suspecting that thinking of a running environment that thinks chiefly of itself, that remains firmly about it&#x27;s own box, is too old world to be of much real service these days.",1378603607

I don&#x27;t drink much soda. I drink 95% water and unsweetened tea I make at home (jasmine or barley tea bag and one pitcher of water) and the other 5% being milk, juices and soda in that order - and this is a habit I&#x27;ve had for over half my life. Fast food and delivery is generally limited to 1x a week, and I may rely heavily on packaged foods (like trader joes frozen stuffs) but it&#x27;s usually accompanied with a huge salad with only a little vinaigrette as dressing for a total of 1.5-2k calories a day most days. That&#x27;s if I even eat much because I&#x27;m on Adderall _and_ Alli (the OTC version of xenical) quite literally pooping what little fat I&#x27;m eating. I have also gone to the gym anywhere from 2 to 7 times a week with workouts of all sorts, and at some point I even had a trainer looking after me for months as I spent 2-3 hours a day every day with him. And I. look. even. fatter. than. ever. even if I might be able to climb 10 flights of stairs without a sweat and I feel healthy - like how I&#x27;m on track to hit 100k steps (w/fitbit - 10k is about 5 miles) this week without much effort. The only thing that I can&#x27;t do is getting out of my chair more often, and that&#x27;s because I damaged a nerve after doing so a few months ago. For as long as that&#x27;s lasted that hasn&#x27;t done anything noticeable either.<p>A lot of my friends are in the same boat, and we&#x27;re all sick of the same advice. There has got to be something in the equation that people are missing where fat is concerned.

This has a risk of infection should something go wrong in the purification process so that the full virus - or other viruses - somehow get through. This sort of failure would be very risky for newborns.<p>>But the current vaccine, which is based on a genetically modified form of Baker&#x27;s yeast, does not come from human sources. Since human viruses aren&#x27;t in the source material, they can&#x27;t enter the vaccine. There can still be other failure modes, but the most fatal - introduction of virulent particles directly into a newborn baby - can&#x27;t happen through a process failure during vaccine manufacturing.<p>That <i>is</i> interesting and reassuring to learn.

Their Research Division went from 4500 full time employees down to 1000 plus about 500 'contract' employees.  They thoroughly cleaned out rush hour traffic in NY counties Westchester, Putnam, and Dutchess.  There were suicides.<p>Why?  One of their deepest analyses was ""God ceased to smile on IBM"".  The truth was that IBM had their head in the sand, and Andy Grove, Bill Gates, Mike Dell, etc. ate IBM's breakfast, lunch, dinner, and bedtime snack and took their house, car, shoes, suits, ties, and shirts.<p>In 1984, IBM had everything in computing -- X-ray lithography, microelectronics, circuit design, microcode, computer architecture, virtual machines, mass storage, various operating systems, middleware, programming languages, productivity software, system management software, packet switched networks, marketing, and customer support, in the US and around the world.  Nine years later they were nearly bust.  One of the biggest extractions of defeat from the jaws of victory in all of business history.  Main reason:  Head in the sand.  Actually, internally from various sources, both internal and external, they were always just awash in accurate and deep analyses of just what was going on.  It's just that the top management had their heads in the sand.  Dumb.",1322981854

Skimming <a href=""http://arxiv.org/pdf/0709.4281v1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/pdf/0709.4281v1</a> , it looks like Ralph, the main visible-light camera, can distinguish between true blackness and a mere 3k photons per pixel, and at the margin can detect objects of magnitude 14. Coincidentally, that’s about the magnitude of Pluto from earth, and you can’t see it even with a small backyard telescope. So this instrument is less like a consumer camera and more like, say, night-vision goggles.<p>This paragraph originally did the math for Pluto’s brightness wrong (thanks to atakan_gurkan below for pointing that out), so instead let me refer you to a short but interesting Metafilter thread on exactly this question: <a href=""http://ask.metafilter.com/23197/Darkness-at-the-edge-of-town"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ask.metafilter.com/23197/Darkness-at-the-edge-of-town</a> .<p>One more factor – Pluto’s albedo is quite high. It reflects 0.5 to 0.66 of the light falling on it, as opposed to e.g. 0.14 for the moon (which is fairly dark in the scheme of things, but not at all hard to photograph; you can easily overexpose it in a grainless photo with a recent consumer DSLR).<p>So: dim, yes, but still clearly visible.",1322981159

We took it to the extreme by imagining that file transfer is no longer possible for US citizens. Corporations now control the internet, and we are forced to use only their products.<p>To re-implement file transfer, we decided to hijack Facebook's speedy chat service to do our own packet transmission. This is the way it works:<p>-A python localhost server converts binary data into base64 ASCII and forms packets with uuid's, timestamps, seqnums, and the whole 9 yards.<p>-These packets get pumped over localhost to a user script (aka a Greasemonkey script) running on Facebook.com.<p>-This user script handles the scrubbing of incoming chat messages (packets) and populating the chatbox with outgoing packets.<p>-Facebook does _not_ make sending a chat message easy with custom JS, so in order to actually send a chat message, we signal the python localhost server to run a bash script that tells applescript to emulate a keydown event. Hacked up, I know, but it works! Also, this works for any application (desktop, flash embedded, etc) because it's as legit as a real keypress.<p>Just pumping the packets was the first challenge which we finished around 2am. The second obstacle was that facebook decides to drop about 50% of our packets after the first 15, so we then implemented a crude TCP style acknowledgement/handshake method that ensures each packet gets delivered. Implementing TCP inside of TCP... as meta as you get.<p>If you want to watch a video of a nyan cat GIF transmission, go here:<p>http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=tk5m0mqsrFs#t=74s<p>The main point is that despite even the most extreme legal restrictions on the internet, the next generation will always find a way :D<p>Github:\nhttps://github.com/pcottle/emotiface<p>Happy to answer any questions.

But having to debug some third-party ""prelude"" or ""starter kit"" that they read about on Reddit is just going to complicate learning Emacs.  They will spend their time fighting with colors and keybindings instead of learning how to explore Emacs.  It trains users to depend on other people to set their preferences, when the whole point of Emacs is that everything is discoverable and customizable.  (I don't mind including non-core modes like auctex or haskell-mode, but would prefer that they were bundled and maintained in core.)<p>Ultimately, life-long Emacs users have their own set of defaults that they have learned to like over the years.  This is due to muscle memory and habit rather than any objective good.  I recently killed two thirds of my own .emacs and it removed many long-standing annoyances.  Emacs improves, hacks on top of hacks called config files don't.<p>If all sets of possible configurations are equally bad, why not stick to the config file that doesn't require an actual file, and then let users M-x customize as appropriate?  <i>You</i> may not like customize, but it's pretty nice for people that are new to Emacs.  (And, actually, I try to do everything via customize because I'd rather let the computer maintain my config file.)",1322979550

[1]<p>If you have a look back at how long the death of email has been predicted you can go about as far back as the first email service created. Not everyone adopted it.<p>If you want to go back to 2005 you might like the point of view of Stowe Boyd <a href=""http://sto.ly/uCnRMs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sto.ly/uCnRMs</a> regarding this article. Also, I've been on talks/panels on the topic as far back as 2009 <a href=""http://bit.ly/9ENcpJ"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/9ENcpJ</a> and again in 2010 <a href=""http://bit.ly/bG7DVz"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/bG7DVz</a> complete with a sad rendering of an inline Google Wave.<p>How do I feel now about email? Mixed.<p>What I do agree with is the notion of email as a lowest common denominator for exchanging information has a lasting value. What I do not agree with is that email is /enough/ for everyone.<p>Today, you have lots of choices in how you use email or elect to treat it (or ignore it) so that only the most relevant things are presented to you. If you are a company/corporation and you are planning to allow for employee communication the effectiveness of any solution is far removed from just email these days. If anything, we're generating more silos now than we ever have.<p>To the other comments here regarding Salesforce/Chatter, groupware, etc... I get that -- in fact I use that -- but there are still TONS [2] of people that steadfastly maintain that email is the only thing that lets them use their iPhone or Crackberry without jumping through the hoops of corporate VPNs or other hoop jumping exercises to reach a web groupware app that just fundamentally FAILED to ever take into consideration the mobile experience.<p>[1] Yay disclosure! <a href=""http://fudge.org/disclosure/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fudge.org/disclosure/</a>\n[2] totally scientific... yes, you can quote that",1322979403

None of the linked themes appear to, for example, support rcirc.  They support erc instead.<p>A good example of the color proliferation problem is egg; it defines its own diff-added and diff-removed colors, which means if you've already fixed the colors for diff-mode, you have to do the same fix again for egg.<p>So while, yes, color-theme didn't actually work as documented and the new stuff does, it's still practically impossible to try out various color themes.",1322979386

One advantage right of the bat with a unique name is for referencing a configuration to new users to get up and running on Emacs quickly, instead of:<p>1: ""Hey try this configuration until you're up to writing your own.""<p>2: ""Which one?""<p>1: ""my .emacs""<p>Rather than being able to Google: ""Emacs Prelude"" or ""Emacs Starter Kit"".<p>As for educating new users, most people simply don't have the time or regard to build an Emacs configuration that they can be productive with right away from day 1. There's just too much to know all at once. Emacs configurations such as the Emacs Starter Kit and Prelude provide a centralized place for new users to learn. I see how configurations can do anything to increase the confusion they already have. They either don't care and just like how it works better than without the configuration, or they're interested and use THE manual by doing the C-h's, or browsing the configurations files learning new things incrementally, when they feel like it.",1322979344

There's no way it will be enabled by default in Firefox 11. Our implementation needs a lot more testing, especially since there are already very important SPDY-enabled sites live on the Internet. Even if we spit out a perfect implementation of the latest draft spec on the first attempt, it might be the case that these existing sites depend on behavior undefined by the spec and/or bugs in Chrome. These kinds of issues still need to be found and addressed.<p>There is also still work that needs to be done on the spec itself.

This concept does not change from nation-state to nation-state and even if no country in the world defined this behavior as legal rape, it is still rape.

11037936,comment,11036789,11036789,0,0,chipsy,,,"You&#x27;ll never get around the source of the problem, which is that it&#x27;s not the priority of the artist to figure out how to name and organize things. It&#x27;s the same as bothering developers to &quot;update the wiki&quot;. Pick a convention and structure the culture around that by providing a spreadsheet of assets or an equivalent document. Maybe the artists &quot;own&quot; their assets, so you lead with their username. Maybe you&#x27;re building the environments collaboratively, so you lead with the environment first. Maybe you envision the project being a long-term thing like an MMO, so you start with the year and month. These are things that a good producer will keep their eye on, because they reflect how the team is communicating.<p>The most important thing, from the technical standpoint, is that your asset pipeline is robust and can handle weird things. The engine shouldn&#x27;t consume files haphazardly, it should deal with &quot;built&quot; assets, where you can trace things from the in-game content back to the source file. A configuration layer usually appears to give an in-engine ID to a loaded asset, because files and assets do not map 1-to-1. You can choose to fight the organization battle in that layer, rather than in the file system. When you have a slick IDE like Unity, this is all built into the GUI, but a custom engine can just use a batch process to do the same.<p>Version control is useful - not a DVCS, because it doesn&#x27;t scale to binary assets, but SVN or Perforce. Artists will groan about waiting around for the VCS to resolve things and the inevitable problems with locking, renaming, and deleting stuff, but their lives will be better off overall if it&#x27;s in their workflow loop. It&#x27;s &quot;10 hours waiting on SVN Updates&quot; vs &quot;30 hours debugging project history&quot;.<p>Here&#x27;s an article on &quot;import&quot; vs &quot;export&quot; based pipelines, where the thing being &quot;imported&quot; to the engine is a common, standardized format that every tool can export - rather than one proprietary tool the team happens to use:<p><a href=""http://people.cs.aau.dk/~bt/GameProgrammingE09/Pipeline.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://people.cs.aau.dk/~bt/GameProgrammingE09/Pipeline.pdf</a>",1454626474
11037935,comment,11036789,11036789,0,0,groby_b,,,"First, you need to distinguish between in-game assets, and the source models in Maya, Photoshop, etc.<p>For the latter, most large games use an asset management system. Either homebrew, or something like Alienbrain. (Well, people used Alienbrain when I left. Not sure what&#x27;s hip these days)<p>For in-game, there&#x27;s usually a fairly strict organizational scheme. It depends on the game, but usually folders are about &quot;location&quot; - which map, which part of the world, which episode, etc. Asset names indicate a name, and various other bits like left/right hand hold, color, or whatever matters for that asset.<p>It&#x27;s usually the lead artists job to come up with said scheme, unless you have a tech lead for the asset pipeline.<p>If you look for assets, you do a search in the asset management system, which also contains the in-game name and location.<p>For smaller games, you make do by manually organizing, but as things grow, you&#x27;ll start hand-rolling tools.",1454626468
11037934,comment,11036767,11037907,0,0,mhartl,,,"Excellent question. The main reason is that GitHub is great for free public repos, which I generally like having as the default, and using GitHub also enables a Secret Bonus™ at the end of the Git tutorial. When it comes to web apps, though, it&#x27;s better to err on the side of security, so in that case I recommend using free private repos at Bitbucket. (These choices were made mainly because public repos are free at GitHub and private repos are free at Bitbucket. Both services are great and are definitely worth paying for, but in a free online tutorial I prefer to recommend things that are also free.)",1454626464

Part of that information is &quot;What do my friends use?&quot;, part of it is &quot;How does it fit into my life?&quot;, and part of it is &quot;What does it say about me as a person and what I value?&quot;<p>But all of those factors are still subject to reality: if a new product comes out that fits into your life better, eventually somebody&#x27;s going to break ranks and adopt it, and they&#x27;ll be able to explain to their friends, authentically, <i>why</i> they believe it&#x27;s better.  All of the catalysts I mentioned in the original post reflect changes in the ecosystem: the shift from ease-of-use to features & compatibility reflects <i>more things you can do with the product</i>, the shift from features to reliability reflects <i>using the product in more consequential situations</i>, and the shift from reliability to branding & maintenance reflects <i>how you&#x27;re perceived for choosing the product</i>.<p><i>The Tipping Point</i> describes the mechanism for this in consumer markets well.  Product adoption starts off with Mavens, people who like trying & evaluating new technology on its own merits.  It spreads through Connectors, who have a wide circle of friends and enjoy telling them about interesting new things that might benefit their life.  Finally, the holdouts are convinced by Salespersons who explain, point-by-point the benefits and answer objections.",1454626419

Politicians have adapted by learning to operate in an enviroment which requires them to explicitly represent the constituency without rational thought. It&#x27;s not like politicians actually sit down and discuss issues with each other. They merely say what they need to say, in a public form, to satisfy the constituency who supports them. Watch CSPAN for 10 minutes and you see that they aren&#x27;t actually taking <i>to</i> anyone. No discussion can be had, because there is actually no conversation going on at all.<p>So when a politician &quot;flip flops&quot; or &quot;lies&quot;, the public becomes even more irate. But the politicians are simply doing the only thing they can in an environment where there is no understanding of civics.<p>The amount of money in politics definitely contributes to the problem, but the people actually need to collectively decide what they want politicians to do—do they want them to merely be responsive or actually try to move forward?

Second, I sincerely wish you the best luck in getting people to pay for it in a way that is sustainable for a business. We built a user interface that made truly secure group file sharing accessible to mere mortals and said mortals were uninterested.<p>About three months after we shut down the business Edward Snowden made his infamous leak(s) and it became obvious to me that commercial crypto products coming out of the United States would be met with extreme levels of skepticism for some time to come. Any remotely centralized solution to the problems of key distribution and encryption are probably dead on arrival because of the single point of jurisdiction/political failure. It really doesn&#x27;t matter how open you are (unfortunately).<p>Two things really stand out to me about this implementation. 1) The trustworthiness of the key exchange doesn&#x27;t appear to employ a mechanism that protects against a man in the middle. 2) They mention the possibility of in-browser Javascript crypto.

In some cases I find them handy, like in this instance where I wanted the COM interfaces embedded in the main class file. Also to clearly separate which functions belong to the manipulation of master vs individual program audio levels.<p>The region paradigm is very often misused and is one of those things that starts off nice and then degrades as time goes on (meaning new functions get added in the wrong region, refactorings end up all over the place, etc). I prefer them though over partial classes (shudder) and when properly used they can be a huge timesaver when dealing with those annoying UBER-Forms that tend to happen when dealing with legacy WinForms code :)",1454625092

This is exacerbated by a lot of research prototype quality code in the Matlab ecosystem; grad students don’t necessarily have the bandwidth to worry about regression tests or compatibility workarounds.<p>More generally: (a) Most Matlab packages have much messier APIs than the equivalent python packages, and anything complicated written in “object oriented Matlab” tends to have much weirder failure modes in edge cases than Python, because the basic data types and control flow mechanisms are much less robust and much less capable than Python/Ruby/Lua/Javascript/Lisp/etc. equivalents. (b) Python has much broader library support for doing anything that isn’t pure number crunching, which makes it a much more flexible tool overall.<p>If you can do your work sticking to only the packages directly provided by Mathworks, and you are comparing those to third-party Python libraries for equivalent functionality, then you might be right though.",1454625000

In other words, if the &quot;new functionality&quot; is perceived to outweigh the costs of the lack of reliability, the product will be deemed &quot;less buggy&quot; because people &quot;understand&quot; why there are issues.<p>This made total sense in some of Apple&#x27;s biggest products: OS X and iPhone. When OS X first came out it couldn&#x27;t even burn CDS, but we all &quot;understood&quot; the magnitude of the project and thus gave it some slack. Similarly, the iPhone lacked a lot and was slow, but it was such a revolution that we let it slide -- in fact we let the rest of the products slide.<p>The problem today I think is that these decisions are being made for reasons that users don&#x27;t deem &quot;worthy&quot;. Introducing some new music services is not a good enough reason to break my iTunes. The fact that a new watch was released is not considered important enough to let other platforms languish. We &quot;get&quot; why less attention is being paid to other products, but unlike with the phone, its not deemed a good trade off.<p>In other words, I don&#x27;t think Jobs was distracting us with <i>promises</i>, but with actual shiny things that made the bugginess worthwhile.",1454624976

Scrolling through my newsfeed had become a bad mindless habit, one that sucked my time and emotional energy without giving anything back. But dang, it was hard to break. This hasn&#x27;t been my first time getting away from FB, but it&#x27;s been the most successful so far.<p>There is value for me in having a FB account. There are some people that I only communicate with through the service, and I&#x27;m part of some groups that do all their event organization through FB. Deleting my account, for me, was both undesirable and impractical. But I sure as hell wanted to break my addiction.<p>I started using a simple habit tracker on Android call Rewire to track my progress in breaking this habit.  After a few false starts, &quot;don&#x27;t break the chain of success&quot; became more motivating than I originally thought it would be.<p>I also ramped up the severity of my FB diet instead of going cold turkey right off the bat. This was roughly my progression:<p>1. Delete the phone app. There&#x27;s not a great way around this. I still use Messenger, and for the first time I find myself really glad that the services are separated.<p>2. I started logging in and out of the service in a browser. When I finally tore myself away from the newsfeed, I&#x27;d sign out. When I was tempted to go back, having to sign in again was a usability barrier, but also a reminder to myself of what I was trying to accomplish. Sometimes it was enough to help me resist actually logging in.<p>3. No mobile FB. I did my best not to log in through a mobile browser. I still allowed myself to browse on a laptop or desktop.<p>4. No more FB. I configured my email settings to get notifications about very specific things and then looked at my news feed on a desktop browser for what would hopefully be the last time. My personal rule: if I get an email about something that was directed particularly to me, whether it&#x27;s somebody posting on my page or somebody tagging me in a comment, I will log in through a desktop browser, address that event, and immediately log out. No looking at the newsfeed, no browsing to friends&#x27; pages. I also unsubscribed from all the promo emails FB started sending me when it detected that I was inactive.<p>I hope this helps! Breaking my FB addiction was tough, but very rewarding. I don&#x27;t miss my newsfeed full of political vitriol and worthless clickbait. I&#x27;ve had more rewarding conversations with friends I care about through other means. I don&#x27;t miss being part of &quot;the conversation.&quot; So, A++, would recommend, but be realistic and gentle with yourself as you progress.<p>Good luck!",1454624546

Remember that terms like junior doctor or doctor in training in the UK typically refer to anyone below the level of GP or Consultant. That covers typically 6 years of academic training, followed by at least 5 years of postgraduate clinical practice. Even someone in their fifth postgraduate year, working full time, and making progress as rapidly as the system allows still has a base salary under 35K, and not everyone will progress that quickly.<p>So, depending on what funny business happens with counting base salaries vs. additional income and what happens with junior doctors&#x27; contracts when the current clash with the government has been resolved, a proposal like the one we&#x27;re talking about really could wind up with someone several years into a career as a junior doctor falling foul of the rules.<p>Of course it&#x27;s highly unlikely to come to that, because the NHS is already in serious trouble and would surely collapse completely without the foreign workers it employs not just as doctors but more widely.

We solved this at a previous company using in-game editor tools (material editors, level editors, character editors, AI script editors, etc) that all interfaced with a database back-end.  The database didn&#x27;t store the files, those were stored in Perforce (which the tools interfaced with as well).  The database just stored metadata for each version of each asset along with the relational links between assets.  So, for example, a particular 3D model referenced a particular material (storing just its id/foreign-key in the DB), which in turn referenced a set of textures and perhaps a shader.<p>An asset browser allowed you to perform queries (e.g. show me all the characters from level X which reference materials which reference texture Y).  We had tags/labels, comments, everything you could want.<p>When you do it like this your folder organization becomes irrelevant.  You can store everything in a single directory with a GUID for a filename if you want.  Or store all textures in one place and all 3d models in another.

A precarious one at that.\nThe interesting part in the model you present is the use of investment portfolios to get on the housing ladder. Its as if working hard isn&#x27;t enough, you need some extra device, with a degree of risk and luck to make the leap to home ownership.<p>Its great to imagine what would happen if people couldn&#x27;t buy second homes, or being innovative over how a special tax rate could be applied to young people. No-one really knows the answers until it happens. My gut feeling is that renting is unethical - I know I couldn&#x27;t bring myself to make money out of someone renting if I had my own house and enough money already. But that&#x27;s it, none of these issues are based on isolated models.<p>My crude knee jerk ideas: \nA maximum cap on rental prices indexed to minimum wage.<p>A preference model where first time buyers get 1st picks.<p>A trusted simple well thought out online platform that makes buying and selling a house as easy as possible (replacing the trickery of estate agents).<p>And for Landlords: Absolutely robust laws always favouring the right of the tenant, so landlords are forced to acknowledge a social responsibility to their tenants - what bigger responsibility could you have for another human being then being a Landlord.<p>An online platform where tenants can request references on Landlords from old tenants.",1454623221

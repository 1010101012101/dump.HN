If its not available on Kindle with Prime i'll have it next day.  You can't compete with Amazon.  So its not worth trying.<p>If you want to run a remarkable book store today, don't sell books.  That's a loosing battle.  This is where i'd start if I was trying to think of ways to innovate in this space.  I'm sure you're familiar with Porter square books.

But then I write research code, not production code, so life is a bit different for me (prototypes vs. products). If you are applying and checking in a bug fix, you don't want to do that in your off hours. If you are building a compiler/interpreter/editor for a new language from scratch to explore some design ideas, then off hours are useful in pushing things along since there are lots of unknowns that require time to mull over. Also, you get something to sleep on.",1353819477

So I installed Windows 7, and now I don't have any more quarrels with Unity and Ubuntu 12. Problem solved! I still use a Mac and a Linux box via combinations of ssh and Synergy.  I don't like Unity (the window manager) either, but I'm honestly mystified why so many people fall on their swords over this instead of just getting back to work, or using a different distro.<p>I installed Lubuntu on an old machine to use on my TV, and it's just like old times on the Window manager, except it uses up to date packages.  Why all the trail of tears?  The author is willing to install Cynagenmod 10 on his phone, but he's not willing to just install a different flavor of Linux on his desktop?  That's just silly.

4827303,comment,4827080,4827186,1,0,Bullshituserid,,,"The biggest failing of the Mac OS UI is forcing all apps to share a single menu, which remains glued to the top of one screen.  This effectively turns your entire monitor into a single window, and encourages developers to spawn a flotilla of floating child windows.  Thus you can't minimize or resize the application's UI, because you're herding a bunch of independent windows around.<p>Not to mention the annoyance of rolling up to the menu and opening an item, only to find that it's not the menu for the app whose UI dominates the screen.  If you ""quit"" Mail by dismissing its UI and revealing Xcode behind it, the menu bar is still owned by Mail.  Goddamned stupid.<p>It also contributes to this asinine mania for keeping apps running, even though you've ""closed"" them.

Putting their private parts near it? Yeah right.

However, it is only an implementation ""of inferior quality"" that does not maintain them: it's in the category of ""SHOULD"".<p>""""""UIDNOTSTICKY is an admission by the server that either the server or the mail store is of inferior quality that can not comply with the design requirements of IMAP UIDs.

If you still insist on using an inferior server, the result will be weird and will be, well, inferior ;P, but at least it will work.<p>And yes: I've seen that specific block of source code before, because people paste it around all the time as it is fun to complain about things with foul language and insult the things that people do; that doesn't make it an accurate description of the state of affairs, nor certainly does it indicate anything about the design constraints of the protocol.<p>As for why the server is allowed to send arbitrary command responses at any time, most people consider that a feature for the same reason they considered IDLE a feature: the original IMAP protocol was highly asynchronous, and simply streamed protocol state to the client whenever things were updated so that the local client would have a live-updated display.<p>The result is that the protocol, to a very real extent, doesn't even have ""command responses"": they are kind of a specification concept; instead, it simply has state update messages, and some commands are guaranteed to flush caches and force state updates (which then have timing constraints in when they can be sent, which as a client are mostly irrelevant and for a server are trivially implemented if you do so conservatively).",1353819041

Certainly not more attractive than Orlando (2% lower than US average COL).<p>But of course, what city we consider ""attractive"" is also a choice.  If one considers Manhattan to be the most attractive because of some particular attribute, then choosing to live in the most attractive space is going to be costly and perhaps out of reach with a single middle class income.

The math works sort of like this, one investigator's salary is $S, and one investigator can handle one transaction 'stream' in real time. We'll call $D the number of transactions a doctor is approving, and 'N' the number of doctors making transactions.<p>Hospitals tend toward either 'having fraud' or 'not having fraud' so the one investigator ($S) covering a hospital can decrease the at risk transactions by Nh*$D where 'n' is the number of Doctors at the hospital.<p>To investigate a private practice you have a small number of doctors ""Ns"" and busting them recovers a much smaller 'transactions per investigator' value. So an investigator looking into one doctor doesn't have an impact on the other doctors that have private practice in the same building.<p>As the cost of investigation is part of the budget (as are the payouts) you can afford to give more of the budget payout to Hospitals because your your per doctor investigator cost is lower.

The right to own the product of your work is incredibly important to the creator's life.  If you make something, whether it be a wood carving, a sandwich, or even a computer program or piece of music, that thing is yours.  To take that something from someone without consent is theft.<p>When it comes to intellectual property, the only way to control the <i>thing</i> is to control its distribution.  If the creator has no ability to set the terms by which the book, song, software program, etc. can be used, then there's no such thing as ownership of the created work.<p>I think that's a worse loss than any temporary financial gain that could be had by the loss of IP rights, as those IP rights are <i>everything</i> to the creator.  If a creator doesn't own what he creates, and he can't trade his creation on his own terms, how can he succeed in life?   Where's that pride of knowing that what you made is YOURS and you can control it?<p>Imagine a situation where an accomplished, proud artist spends years painting what he considers his life's masterpiece.  Then the next evening, a thief runs off with painting, but leaves a stack of $100 million in cash with a note that says ""SOLD!"".  Was the artist justly compensated?  Would there be articles written about how art theft could leave artists with more money than on the market?",1353816284

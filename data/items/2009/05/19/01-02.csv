ESPECIALLY people talking on the cellphone in the car.<p>I have to turn the radio down, and I have to pretend that I'm not listening to your conversation.  When you're finished, am I allowed to comment on what you were just talking about?<p>Here is an idea, if the two of us must share a dinner table, or a car, put your freaking phone on silent, you are not <i>THAT</i> important and neither is anybody else.<p>On another note, I am starting to believe that our generation is becoming culturally dead.  I was recently at a ""Rabbit in The Moon"" show.  Its a visual/audio spectacular/rave type of thing.  Think big flame throwing half naked women, a guy in a giant hamster ball, and just general craziness.<p>YOu know what drove me absolutely, completely, positively insane?  It wasn't the teenagers on ecstacy in their ""cuddle puddles"" or the half-naked dudes running around trying to sell me drugs, it was the morons in the front row more pre-occupied with trying to pop off a photo with their telephone than with the absolutely fantastic show they could have been witnessing.<p>WTF Is wrong with people?  Is the crappy, grainy video with bad sound of the show that you can post on your myspace page so that your friends thing you're cool REALLY more important to you than actually EXPERIENCING what is going on around you?<p>Is that what it has become now?  It isn't the experience, it is <i>bragging</i> about the experience to people on the internet.<p>It makes me sad :(.",1242697926

616086,comment,615088,615952,0,0,spoondan,,,"A few cases that have occurred over the years:<p>1. Working with inherited code, one of the original programmers had an identifier I <i>believed</i> was ""el"" (short for ""element"") but that was actually ""e1"" (presumably short for ""element 1""). You don't know frustration until your compiler tells you ""undefined identifier 'el'"" when, by all appearances, there's nothing wrong with your code. Not only did I waste a couple of hours on this, but the stress probably shortened my life by a few hours, too.<p>2. Embarrassingly enough: For reasons that I don't understand, I have on a couple of occasions typed a zero where I meant to type an uppercase 'O'. I shipped Python code that had a bug in it because I assigned a value to ""box0ffset"" instead of ""boxOffset"". The bug was thankfully minor, and I obviously must have been smoking crack to make this typo, but it has happened and could have been avoided if I'd been using a good font.<p>3. I've seen C code (I think in an open source project) where the programmer typed something along the lines of ""100l"". He probably meant to type ""100L"" and just missed the SHIFT key. By this time, I'd switched to a font that had an ""l"" that was clearly distinct from a ""1"", but I imagine that I would have otherwise been utterly perplexed.<p>These are probably not everyday examples. The circumstances in which confusion is possible are rare. But they <i>do</i> happen and are (in some sense) expensive. At the very least, it's a whole class of errors that's easily and cheaply avoided by choosing an attractive font that minimizes the opportunities for confusion. Why risk the frustration?",1242697786

So we'll probably see a small bounce eventually but from there it'll probably be a decade before we reach pre-bust levels.",1242697631

I sit in a cafe and can't remember which city I'm in. It's really the people you meet that stand out, but the sample size per city is still quite small. It's easy to claim that you get exposed to a different culture, but if you only get to know a few dozen people then you might have found a similar culture back home in a different neighborhood.<p>I think the key is the attitude change that is often stimulated by, but not necessarily caused by travel. You could get the same thing by waking up one morning and realizing you'd like to meet some folks from the other side of town and learn what they think about life, work, love, etc.<p>Disclaimer: I travel for work. Meeting up with CouchSurfers keeps me sane.",1326866399

Google truly has the power to 'melt phones' so they may not be able to advocate that, but aren't there other things that can be done?<p>How many supporters would these types of bills have if it was very clear to readers who were the supporters and opposition to these bills?  If congress knew their name was potentially going to be plastered on google or wikipedia, would they have a different stance?<p>If SOPA opposition was looking for a tagline, I think this comes as close as anything - ""The U.S. government could order the blocking of sites using methods similar to those employed by China"".",1326866361

3478222,comment,3477081,3477081,1,0,silverlight,,,"Very neat. I actually had a similar idea 2 or 3 months ago (although I'm sure this is older than that) to modify Etherpad Lite into a wiki to replace the Dokuwiki we currently use at work. I was going to just build a front-end that managed the documents, though, and only pass it off to Etherpad for the actual editing. This is a much more elegant solution, and the ""@"" linking is genius!<p>If you were ever considering contributing your modifications back to the community/Etherpad/Etherpad Lite, I would certainly make good use of them. Unfortunately our wiki is a highly integrated component of our custom-built Intranet, so we couldn't make use of a SaaS solution for it. But congrats all the same!

Mediocre, petty middle managers are the algae that are sucking the oxygen out of Yahoo.<p>I may get jeered for saying this, but a non-trivial amount of it was a result of Jerry. He kept his buddies around in high places for too long, and the rot set in. There were VPs in Yahoo who contributed absolutely nothing (and probably are still around, but I left). But they were always blocking progress just to stroke their own egos. Once you have nepotism and incompetence at the top, it just flows down naturally and the next thing you know there is widespread politics and infighting between teams. It becomes a feedback loop; the good people leave, and are replaced with buddies of the current incompetents.<p>The way to fix this is to actually make the problem worse for a while, by segregating the groups into independent units. Then you fix each of these units, one at a time. Then you bring them back into the fold.<p>Can anyone there do it? I doubt it. Most of the decision makers are too busy playing politics.",1326866042

That said, it's not hard to turn up examples with a few minutes looking through my bookshelf and Google Scholar.<p>For automated testing, just stick search terms like ""automated software testing"" into Scholar and set the latest year to, say, 2000. You'll turn up dozens of papers going back decades that talk about techniques similar to what we would call unit testing today.<p>Continuous integration is another obvious one. The likes of Grady Booch were writing about the advantages of frequent integration builds by the early '90s. The term ""continuous integration"" appears in <i>Object-Oriented Analysis and Design with Applications</i> (1993), for example.<p>The prior existence of refactoring techniques is kind of obvious, as people had been discussing simple transformations like moving functions and data up and down a class hierarchy since the dawn of OOP. If you want a specific citation, <i>Design Patterns</i> (1995) mentions the specific term ""refactoring"" a few times, in turn citing academic papers on the subject cowritten by one of the authors as early as 1990, around a decade before Fowler's book and several years before Beck coined the term according to some Agile advocacy.<p>That's all I've got time for now, but I'm sure you could find eqally authoritative sources for the other things I talked about if you genuinely want to know.",1326865716

Anyone who can't work (even for medical reasons, or because of the employer's negligence) is left to die on the street, their position easily filled by a new hire. Employers realize that, so long as nobody starts it, competition is voluntary.

3478038,comment,3477966,3477966,19,0,tokenadult,,,"The time delay in implementation of the black-out on my system (via JavaScript) probably helps make the point more. I went to the main page (the link here) not by following the link from this thread, but from my browser history. I saw a brief glimpse of today's main page, and then the screen image changed to Wikipedia's black-out page. I went to the information page, and there it still shows all the headings a Wikipedian will see when logged in: the user's own user page, and user talk page, and so on. So I followed the link to my user page, and it too displayed for the briefest tantalizing moment before showing the black-out page. Slick. I tried some other stored URLs from my browser history, and they all briefly displayed the appropriate Wikipedia page before being overwritten with the black-out notice. This will get attention.<p>The black-out information page<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:SOPA_initiative/Learn_more"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:SOPA_initiative/Learn...</a><p>says ""The Wikipedia community has blacked out the English version of Wikipedia for 24 hours on January 18th to raise awareness about legislation being proposed by the U.S. Congress,"" but I see it also includes advice for residents of other countries about what to do about the legislation.<p>The information page even includes a response to the question ""In carrying out this protest, is Wikipedia abandoning neutrality? Can I still trust Wikipedia?"" The response is ""We are staging this blackout because, although Wikipedia’s articles are neutral, its existence actually is not. Wikipedia depends on its existence for a free and open, uncensored Internet."" This immediately suggests some other countries that it might be important to draw more attention to on Wikipedia. I wonder if that will happen. If it doesn't, I may indeed start doubting the neutrality of Wikipedia even more than I already do.<p>Mobile devices are exempted from the black-out, according to the information page, and anyone can turn off the black-out by disabling JavaScript. (I enable JavaScript on Wikipedia to take advantage of various Wikipedia editing tools.) I'll have to experiment with viewing the site some more, and I'll be curious to see what the worldwide reaction is. Again, I wonder what users will suggest what other countries to protest about with regard to Internet censorship.<p>AFTER EDIT: In another experiment, I posted a Wikipedia link to Facebook to tell friends about the background to my new favorite pop song. The link<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_This_Kolaveri_Di"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_This_Kolaveri_Di</a><p>still shows correct summary text when embedded in a Facebook comment. That the links are still pasteable and still have usability when submitted to discussion forums is an especially nice aspect of how Wikipedia implemented its blackout. (P.S. The direct link to the official video for the new song, which is rapidly going viral around the world, is<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YR12Z8f1Dh8"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YR12Z8f1Dh8</a><p>from Sony Music India hosted on YouTube.)",1326863948

2570851,comment,2569870,2569870,3,0,hga,,,"<i>Will I stop being employable?</i><p>As a conventional, salaried programming employee?  Yes.  (In what other field does 5 of so years of experience allow you a title with ""Senior"" in it?)<p>My experience is illuminating in that I'm blessed with genes that allow me to look <i>much</i> younger than I am.  I'm now 50 and in casual encounters (e.g. in stores or restaurants) I'm still routinely mistaken for an 20s something possible student (of course I dress the part).<p>In the '90s, as I made the journey from 30 to 40 I noticed it became harder and harder to get results from sending out resumes ... until I got a clue and scrubbed my resume of the hard evidence of how old I was (education dates; by the time this happened I'd already scrubbed it of jobs prior to 1990).<p>The difference was like night and day, and if I watched my words I was able to keep up the subterfuge until I was hired and had to prove to HR I could be legally employed, something that didn't necessarily make its way to my managers.  There was one interview a bit less than a decade ago where I slipped and mentioned working on PDP-11s ... the response was ""Just how old <i>are</i> you?!??!!"" (yes, that's illegal, but it was an instant honest response).  They did hire me but it didn't work out; they were desperate but it's just as likely it was due to total cluelessness of the real customer, a state agency.<p>So my advice is one or more of the following:<p>Hide your age if you can and for however long you can.  They can't legally ask.<p>Transition as quick as you can to a field that doesn't care so much about age.  Embedded tends to be one (although not the Detroit car companies).<p>Get out of the conventional salaried programming career (""Nobody ever got rich typing"").  As noted by others, you can move to management (which is genuinely challenging).  You can be a consultant, although that tends to be a hard life.  Or otherwise become your own boss, i.e. be a founder of startups.<p>Note that my experience is on the East Coast; I've <i>heard</i> that age discrimination in the Bay area is much worse.",1305985527

I don't expect a double-blind randomised trial or publication in Nature, but surely when someone says to us ""this is the truth"", we must ask ""why?""<p>If the author had said ""I think that people are born stupid or clever, and stupid people are very dangerous, so we should watch out for them."" I would disagree, but not loudly - it is, after all, a matter of opinion unless someone has facts to bring to the table.<p>But when someone dresses up their conjecture in make-believe laws and pseudo-scientific formulae, they are being deceptive. Perhaps a more acceptable thing to do would be dispassionately describe the flaws in his argument, but the deception made me angry and I don't see anger as necessarily wrong. I don't believe I wrote anything inaccurate, or anything I wouldn't say if the article was brought up among my friends.<p>Frankly, I'm surprised I was the only one.

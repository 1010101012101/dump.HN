7632876,comment,7631389,7631389,1,0,sycren,,,"I&#x27;m commenting on the marketing aspect as a marketing analyst:<p>I would:<p>1) Change the navigation of the site making About 2nd.<p>In About, I honestly find it daunting that there is seemingly only one person behind it. The number of people behind a product doesn&#x27;t matter so much, but it does matter how this is displayed. So for instance there is no info about Gary on who he is or to his twitter or linkedin. This kind of information is like a validation mechanism like testimonials and doesn&#x27;t hurt to add. If anything, it makes the team member seem more real and accountable even if most of the users will never contact them through it.<p>The founder - Dominic St-Pierre is mentioned but there is no info about him at all.<p>2) Change your about page by:\na) Adding all team member profiles to the page\nb) Providing more info about each team member\nc) Adding twitter & linkedin links to the team member profile<p>Example: <a href=""https://hootsuite.com/about/leadership"" rel=""nofollow"">https://hootsuite.com/about/leadership</a> \nEven larger companies like twitter and twilio do something like this - <a href=""http://www.twilio.com/company/management"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.twilio.com/company/management</a> <a href=""https://about.twitter.com/company/leadership"" rel=""nofollow"">https://about.twitter.com/company/leadership</a><p>d) Put the team members at the bottom and the text from the founder at the top. If possible, add a story about why this company was made to solve what pain points for which audience.<p>3) Add a call to action button to &#x27;Try Osmosis&#x27; in the navigation bar next to Login.\nYour call to action on the homepage is very prominent which is great, but on other pages you need to scroll down and so you probably lose potential customers. I would be surprised if this didn&#x27;t increase your conversion rate.<p>4) To allow more information to be presented above the fold, move your Osmosis logo to the left allowing you to push up the rest of the content.<p>5) Consider the structure of your homepage, we have in order: \ni)   Heading - Telling user what the product is in one line\nii)  Video - Explaining what product is in easy format\niii) Call to Action button - To get users to sign up\niv)  Pain points - how this will help the user\nv)   Integrations - how this will work with other user applications\nvi)  Testimonials - How other users find it<p>You should consider adding info about the features in the space where the pain points reside like - <a href=""http://www.twilio.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.twilio.com/</a>\nThat also helps the user to understand how your software will work with the integrations.\nConsider a long form page. Look here for a comparison - <a href=""http://conversionxl.com/long-form-or-short-form-why-not-both/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://conversionxl.com/long-form-or-short-form-why-not-both...</a>\nIf you can, try to standardise the font-size across all the pages. The 13px text looks odd in contrast to everything else especially on the integrations page.<p>Consider moving testimonials up the page. KashFlow (<a href=""http://www.kashflow.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kashflow.com/</a>) has video testimonials above the fold from different customers and twitter testimonials just below the fold. If you did move them up, then the testimonials link on the navigation page could move to a different page with more content - <a href=""http://www.kashflow.com/about/our-customers/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kashflow.com/about/our-customers/</a><p>Hope that helps<p>I need to get off to work now. nb.

7632866,comment,7632094,7632094,119,0,elohesra,,,"Has anyone actually read the studies linked by the author to back up his drivel? I&#x27;ll save you some time: the 2007 study isn&#x27;t valid even by the low levels of scientific burden required for psychological studies (it&#x27;s entirely based on self-reporting), and the 1982 study support the <i>opposite</i> conclusion to the author&#x27;s. In fact, the 1982 study [0] finds that men and women simply have <i>different kinds</i> of friendships, where men are likely to only engage in emotional sharing with their closest friends, and women are more likely to engage in emotional sharing with all their friends.<p>This brings me on to challenging the true point of the article: slating the traditional male gender role. It&#x27;s no accident that the author turns to the authority of feminists for perspectives on men -- despite that being so laughly outside the remit of feminism -- because the entire point, unstated but present, throughout the article is that women have &#x27;got it right&#x27; and men should be more like women. In lieu of any studies which actually support his point (note that only the first two studies in the article actually even discuss his point about male friendships, the rest are an irrelevance), he instead uses anecdote as evidence for a point neither study can support, and then goes on to blame the entire mess on the traditional male gender role. I won&#x27;t defend the male gender role, because I have no stock in doing so, but I would at least ask that if something&#x27;s going to be blamed for mens&#x27; terrible friendships then we at least provide some proof that men do indeed have terrible friendships.<p>Lastly, the article, like so many in the media, is yet another argument that encourages you to accept its faulty form by providing you with a false dichotomy: the argument begs the question that either type of friend (the emotional numerous friends of women, or the close few friends of men) is a superior type of friend, links some &#x27;evidence&#x27; which doesn&#x27;t support its point, and then encourages you to ask yourself whether men or women &#x27;have it right&#x27; before even bothering to prove if there&#x27;s anything to actually <i>get right</i> in this situation.<p>I will say one thing though: if this is the kind of stuff Men&#x27;s Journal prints, then either its readership is mostly women, or men sure do love self-flagellation.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.peplaulab.ucla.edu/Peplau_Lab/Publications_files/Caldwell%20%26%20Peplau%2082.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.peplaulab.ucla.edu/Peplau_Lab/Publications_files/...</a>",1398242396

Also, you could introduce a FromRequest trait (trivially implemented by Request, returning self) to allow the user to build structures directly from a request (and its converse ToResponse), giving your function a signature of:<p><pre><code>    fn (context: Context, req: FromRequest) -> ToResponse\n\n    trait FromRequest {\n      fn from_request<&#x27;a>(req: &&#x27;a Request) ->  &&#x27;a Self;\n    }\n\n\n    impl FromRequest for Request {\n      fn from_request<&#x27;a>(req: &&#x27;a Request) ->  &&#x27;a Request {\n        req\n      }\n    }\n</code></pre>\nThis would remove a lot of boilerplate for well-behaved applications. You&#x27;ll also need a notion of middleware, which I guess would take a Request and return either a ToResponse or a request (eg, an authentication handler ought to return the response immediately in case of authentication failure), and similarly on the way out, something taking a Response and returning a Response.",1398242126

After a few years of solitude, my mother started to develop a whole new life (with 80). I think this will develop also for your father, it just takes time. But he has to be ready for it and there is little you can do to accelerate the process. Maybe he was busy with you and your sister until recently?<p>Key for him is to leave the house. Go to the doctor, buy fresh food on the market instead of in the mall and chat a few words with the farmers, join sports teams (my mother did when she was 78) or meet with colleagues for a beer (they all want an excuse not to go home, believe me).<p>My brother and I also live far away. That is not a problem (as long as he is in good health…), because it assures that your father has to manage his life for himself instead of sitting down and let you organize it. Also make him visit you instead of the other way round. This will let him leave the house, see different towns, revive his interest in life and discovery and he has to make plans (this is important). It worked for us, at least.<p>Where I live, also the church has groups for tea/coffee and cake. So has the red cross. This may aim at older people but it is great to go there. My mother loves it. (yes, I know, she is a woman and women make contacts easier).\nBut, as I said, some day he will be ready.",1398241018

This is done by having hostname part of the initial handshake.<p>Many websites or at least most (hopefully all) webapps these days serve over  https, at least the ones that require user input like login. So there&#x27;s the need for at least one public IP per site.<p>With SNI these could be all served from the same IP.<p>Now imagine CDN services like AWS CloudFront -- to support sites with SSL certificates you must use one IP per cert in EACH region or whatever the distribution granularity is.<p>Now this my friends is why AWS CloudFront asks $600/mo for each custom SSL cert domain and with SNI custom SSL it costs $0/mo.<p>As soon as all the 99.9% browsers/clients support SNI we&#x27;ll be living in a better place with more free IPs. So we can finally distribute static content from CDN through custom SSL without the $600/mo pricetag.<p>It&#x27;s naive to think everyone would go to SNI-based hosts with IPs shared with strangers but at least within the same datacenter for the same company IPs can be more easily conserved.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication</a>",1398240569

7632753,comment,7631975,7631975,1,0,benzofuran,,,"So, as somebody who works with these guys, that payrate comes with a few caveats:<p>1)  Most of the pay in welding comes from contract jobs.  When looking at salaried/shop welders, you&#x27;re looking more in the range of $50k-$100k USD/year.  When the welders are on contracts, they&#x27;re typically on 4 week on / 1 week off rotations or further out (6/2 and 8/2 are not unusual).<p>2)  When the welders are on contract work and on rotation, they&#x27;ll be working 12 hours/day, every day, on them, or that&#x27;s how the pay agreements work out.  So 84 hour weeks, and you&#x27;re not paid for your off rotation.<p>3)  This works to annual work of roughly 3500 hours.  At $150k, assuming they&#x27;re paid straight time (many do get overtime but I don&#x27;t feel like doing the math), the hourly rate works out to $42 / hour, which is not that great (it&#x27;s not terrible either).<p>Many do make more than $150k, however some are on elevated pay for hazard rate (subsea work, politically unstable areas, etc), and other have additional modifiers (hot bunking adds $250/day in some cases).  Keep in mind as well that most of this work goes on in fairly horrible places (deserts, jungles, subsea), and they welders are spending weeks if not months away from not only their families, but often any communication to the outside world.  <i>The pay is there for a reason.</i><p>Note: On many vessels and offshore platforms there&#x27;s extremely limited bandwidth for personal use, often just a 256k satellite connection of which at least half is used for operations.  So that&#x27;s 128k-256k between 16-40 people who can only use devices for 2-3 hours a day.<p>Ask away with further questions, I&#x27;m a corrosion and materials engineer who works in conjunction with a lot of welders and others on contract projects.",1398240440

8059455,comment,8058724,8059435,0,0,sillysaurus3,,,"What about making the user choose two passphrases, which are concatenated together by the tool?  Cracking a single passphrase may be easy, but cracking two concatenated passphrases is significantly harder.<p>E.g. password 1: &quot;the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog&quot;<p>Password 2: &quot;jack be nimble jack be sick&quot;<p>Final result, used to derive a keyfile: &quot;the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dogjack be nimble jack be sick&quot;<p>Notice how &quot;quick&quot; was switched with &quot;sick&quot; in the last word.  Now there&#x27;s no pattern that can be easily cracked.  If we force a user to explicitly do something like that, then this can still work.<p>That example was chosen intentionally to be weak. It shows that even with two relatively weak passphrases, the result is still somewhat strong.  If we add extra requirements on top of that, such as forcing the user to use numbers and capitalizations, then the result should be sufficiently unique.",1405825182

Being a Muslim man, I&#x27;ve been stopped and questioned by CBP numerous times when entering the US.  It&#x27;s interesting how they they always seem to ask the same types of questions, in a seemingly friendly manner, but always glancing at the screen in front of them and carefully cross checking everything being said.

That would have shifted the entire balance of power in the nation, and anarchy would have ensued.<p>Edit: gonna leave my initial snark for context, but this isn&#x27;t about Uber to me. It&#x27;s further information about how completely out of bounds the power structure is in the US, and how accountability for police action is continuously declining.<p>&quot;Uber&quot; gives the article some sex appeal, admittedly, but I prefer to have articles about abuses of power up-voted. The more you know, and whatnot.<p>Apologies for the snark, but I&#x27;d rather read this article than not. You give the officer an out - he was &quot;confused&quot; and whatnot - but when you hold power over the general population, &quot;bad calls&quot; aren&#x27;t as easily forgivable, because they cause real world harm - and every time they aren&#x27;t held to account, police feel a bit more invincible.",1405825094

Async functions should never block. If making everything async was a good idea, then underscore would be async.<p>The author also mentions that it is node convention to use callbacks. Sure, that&#x27;s true. But he&#x27;s calling his callbacks the wrong way. Node convention is `callback(error, result)`, not `callback(result)`.<p>Oh and promises ftw.<p>Articles like this hurt JavaScript&#x27;s credibility, and certainly doesn&#x27;t help new JS/node devs.",1405825093

That is what Bruce Schneier means when he talks about good intelligence work and good law enforcement work as protection against terrorism, as opposed to security theatre.<p>Or, put another way: planning to commit a crime (criminal conspiracy) is itself a crime. Being a suspect of a crime is a valid reason for law enforcement to watch someone. Associating closely with someone who&#x27;s part of a conspiracy could very reasonably put you under suspicion for being part of the conspiracy (although it&#x27;s not evidence against you, of course).<p>Of course, the lines between when people are reasonably suspected of crimes has been moved far and fast in the wrong direction and needs to be pushed back.",1405822869

This wouldn&#x27;t necessarily have to affect the way the site appears to function[0], for users who like things the way they are now - but users who want to see more NSA related content could choose (maybe through their account page) to have NSA related content bubble up for them, regardless of their actual gravity.<p>[0] <i>although to prevent certain stories from overwhelming the site anyway, it might be necessary to sort the frontpage by trending tags/groups when multiple stories of the same type exist...

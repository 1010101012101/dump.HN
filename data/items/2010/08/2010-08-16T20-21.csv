You're right, I didn't read the earlier comment carefully enough.

It won't be news to us if a speaker of a Indo-European language finds another Indo-European language easier to learn than a Sino-Tibetan language.<p>Well, let's go through what I said again:<p><i>Not having tones and no huge obstacle to becoming literate makes English a hell of a lot easier to learn.</i><p>I still think that's true. You seem to be saying that people find it easier to learn languages that are more related to their native language than some others, but how is that related to my point about Chinese being quite an undertaking to learn?<p>You quote some literacy statistics, but that's not really relevant to what I said either, is it? An intentional distraction, perhaps.<p>Chinese has got a huge alphabet, and most other languages don't. This means that it's <i>much</i> more difficult to attain literacy in Chinese. Whatever amount of characters you want to draw the line at, it'll still be much more than 26.<p>> I would not stand by idly seeing people slandering the language I love<p>Oh please. No one has slandered your beloved language. The fact remains though, that the tones and characters are a big burden on someone who wants to learn it.",1281991563

Would I consider targetting .NET? No I wouldn't because it locks me in to Microsoft, and will only continue to be available at the whim of Microsoft (consider they canned VB6 when it was one of their most popular languages to replace ith with VB .NET). Now if I was to target my compiler on a platform that runs on lots of OSes, is open-source, etc, then it's more likely to be future-proof. Or say I was writing a web app framework like Rails or Django. I might want it to run on Windows, but I would certainly also want it to run on Unix-like systems such as Linux and MacOS.<p>The impression I get is that that is the main reason why there is less innovation in the Microsoft platform than outside it (e.g. Python, Ruby, Rails, Django, Clojure, Groovy, etc), despite Windows running on most computers. Many good programmers think Windows is simply irrelevant. E.g. PG says:<p>""I'm now surprised when I come across a computer running Windows. Nearly all the people we fund at Y Combinator use Apple laptops. It was the same in the audience at startup school. All the computer people use Macs or Linux now."" -- <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/microsoft.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/microsoft.html</a><p>All programs are written by programmers, and if enough programmers think a platform is irrelevant, it becomes so.<p>Now if Oracle is going to get nasty with what's now their Java platform, that's an opportunity for Microsoft if they want to take it. I've never coded in C# but from what I've read of it, it's a better language than Java and I suspect many Linux programmers would consider using it.<p>Microsoft is still trying to fight their old war against Linux.

1609057,comment,1608129,1608129,0,0,mahmud,,,"Pretty entertaining, if a bit melodramatic.<p>I really wish people didn't mystify such a basic programming skill. Compiler hacking is something reserved for the wizards <i>only</i> if you take the classic definition of compiler implementation: an expensive engineering project, targeting a new processor, architecture or OS.<p>In that sense, sure. You will be working in a lab with hundreds of developers, and tinkering with a piece of multimillion dollar prototype.<p>In reality, however, ""compiler construction"" boils down to foundational language theory, along with various tricks and techniques for translating a set of very straightforward algebriac rules, to another set. Anytime you write regexes or XPath to extract a set of fields from a documents and transform to something ""readable"", you're almost writing a simple one pass assembler, using some implicit ""business rules"" (i.e. all numbers should be floats, names capitalized, etc.) for productions.<p>Compiler skills will give you the theoretical backbone to discover, refine and assess those implicit rules. Not to mention techniques for transforming them from one form to another.<p>To the list of skills made mystical and magical by people I would add Lisp. It's not magic. I mention it because it just so happens to have compiler construction lore aplenty.<p>The first Lisp exercises you will read in your lisp book of choice (often requiring nothing more than basic English literacy and 6th grade arithmetic) are the expression simplification and evaluation exercises. Transforming your elementary school algebra rules (multiplication and division before addition and subtraction, etc.) to something the machine can execute. The hardest part is just understanding the words: if you have a hunch for what ""expression"", ""term"", ""rule"", ""left/right hand-side"" and ""precedence"" might mean, you're good to start.<p>Few chapters of a Lisp book will spare you volumes of traditional compiler construction techniques, taught by rote methods.<p>The first time I attempted to read SICP I had convulsions and physical pain. The whole time I had this inferiority complex nagging at me, telling me this was something for ""smart kids"" and I was unworthy. But this stopped after I went through the first few parts of chapter 1, and took in the playful tone the text. I felt stupid afterward; like being afraid of a St. Bernard.

1609008,comment,1607995,1608463,0,0,neild,,,"I much prefer Python's argument-passing to Perl's barely-there conventions.  Python gives me positional arguments, named arguments, named positional arguments, required arguments, and default values.  Perl gives me @_.  I can, of course, build almost everything that Python gives me using @_, but I'd rather not have to do it all.<p>For example, I can write:<p><pre><code>  def frobnicate(a, b, snozz=True):
      pass

  frobnicate(1, 2)
  frobnicate(a=1, b=2)
  frobnicate(1, 2, False)
  frobnicate(1, 2, snozz=False)
  frobnicate(1) # Error, need to pass at least two args.
  frobnicate(1, 2, snooze=False) # Error, no such argument.
</code></pre>
I'm certain there's a ""Modern"" Perl module that will help with doing this sort of thing, but it's nice to have it there in the language.  Back when I wrote a lot of Perl, I'd always end up with something like this:<p><pre><code>  sub frobnicate {
      my($a, $b, %args) = @_;
      $args{snozz} //= 1;
  }

  frobnicate(1, 2);
  frobnicate(1, 2, snozz => 0);
</code></pre>
Of course, this doesn't include any of the basic error checking I get for free in Python.<p>I like having OO support in the language syntax.  Yes, Perl has Moose now, but the blending of packages and classes is still there.  In Python, I can declare a new class with just a couple lines of code; even a minimal Moose class declaration takes substantially more.  For example:<p><pre><code>  class XPathError(Exception):
      """"""Base exception class for all XPath exceptions.""""""
</code></pre>
Two lines of code to get a useful class.<p>That, of course, ties into one of Perl's big weaknesses, which is exception handling.  I know that there are modules which try to patch over Perl's very weak exception handling model, but again, Python is just so much better.  What's the Perl equivalent of this?<p><pre><code>  try:
      x = int(s)
  except ValueError:
      x = 42
</code></pre>
Perl's core still uses strings for exceptions, which is just horribly fragile and painful to deal with.  Python has solid, pervasive exception handling with exceptions defined as objects in a sane and simple hierarchy.<p>I like the fact that people understand Python.  I was a pretty good Perl coder, back in the day, and I like to think I had a quite deep understanding of the language.  The problem was that I kept dealing with code written by people who didn't.  To some degree, this is a problem in any language, but Perl contains so many traps and pitfalls for the unwary.<p>Consider context.  I understand the difference between scalar context and list context.  I understand why the following two lines of code are equivalent:<p><pre><code>    foo(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6);
    foo(1, (2, 3, (4), ((((5))))), 6);
</code></pre>
I understand when the above lines <i>aren't</i> equivalent.<p>But entirely too many people don't understand this.  And, in my opinion, they <i>shouldn't have to</i>.  I've never once missed list flattening in Python.<p>Perl is big and complicated and powerful.  Some of that complexity is wonderful, but I find that I don't really miss any of it.  Python isn't as big, and it isn't as complicated, but it's just as powerful for me.<p>I haven't missed CPAN.  It's a wonderful collection of code, but Python's PyPi (formerly the cheeseshop) is <i>also</i> wonderful.  We could quibble about what packages are available for each language or the technical details of CPAN vs. PyPi, but let's just say that I'm happy with both.<p>I could go on.<p>Let's just say, however, that I've found there's nothing in Perl that I can't do faster, easier, or more maintainably in Python.  Oh, there's the occasional area where I take a couple lines more code to do something in Python.  There's also the occasional area where I take a couple lines less.  But, overall, things just feel cleaner to me in Python.<p>I used to love Perl unreservedly, but I've been over it for some time now.  When I go back, the idiosyncrasies that I once found charming just annoy me.  I've moved on.<p>You still like Perl, and that's fine.

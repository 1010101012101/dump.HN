If one of them is subverted and can carry weapons aboard, they can establish control over the cockpit by killing the other crew.  By preventing weapons from entering the cockpit, one is preventing this scenario.  The problem is that searches of the pilots are easy to circumvent.  Simply have a terminal worker sneak in a weapon and give it to the pilot.  If this ever happened, the reinforced cockpit doors would very much work against us.  This is a very good reason to pay pilots much more than $19,000 a year!",1289699771

The definition of information is a wild and woolly beast; if you understand the definition you already know what I mean, if you don't you'll argue endlessly without ever having understood what you're arguing against.<p>But what it basically boils down to is a counting argument; if you are a human and you have ten thoughts of various kinds that in your illiteracy all get ""translated"" (putting it politely) to ""lolz that suckz"", no computer algorithm, or indeed anything else, can translate that back out to the original ten thoughts. It could pick one of them and use that, and that chosen though may be extremely eloquently expressed, but that's all it can do. A fixed number of inputs can only go to a fixed number of outputs; there's no magical process whereby anything, not even a human, can take truly useless semantic garbage text and turn that into accurate informative well-written text without loss. There's radically more well-formed, coherent thoughts than there are fuzzy thoughts and there simply isn't any sort of mapping at all from fuzzy to coherent. If someone wishes to communicate precisely, they will always have to put the effort into it, there is no magical shortcut. There's no need to worry about the effects of the magical shortcut on people or on society, no such thing exists.<p>In fact this is actually just another form of the following argument in heavy disguise: <a href=""http://matt.might.net/articles/why-infinite-or-guaranteed-file-compression-is-impossible/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://matt.might.net/articles/why-infinite-or-guaranteed-fi...</a> I'm making the same argument in the other direction; that argues there is no such thing as a ""guaranteed compressor"", I'm arguing in the other direction, that there can not exist a decompresser than can take some smallish set of gibberish and map it to the much richer set of interesting thoughts. Information theory is fun for being able to make arguments about this hypothetical translator and a hypothetical perfect decompresser the same argument in the end.<p>The obvious counterargument is that a human might be able to use more context and extract more details to get a richer sense of the details; a stream of poorly written text can still mean more than one bad tweet. The problem is that the source information is <i>everything</i> that a human or anything else uses to make its decisions. Anything a human could use, a program could in principle use as well, even if we couldn't write it today. Differences between humans and computers are only issues of how good the translator may be; the theoretical limit on both is unaffected by those differences.",1289696715

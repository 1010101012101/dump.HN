2710476,comment,2709834,2710292,1,0,maxharris,,,"Properly speaking, the concept ""monopoly"" properly pertains only to situations where the government enforces the monopoly. This is the original meaning of the word (before it was altered in the 19th and 20th centuries).<p>There is no proper political right for a ""consumer"" to have a choice between multiple brands of a product. If there were such a right, it would be violated the moment they walked into a remote store that didn't happen to carry every single product currently sold on the market. Remember, rights are contextually absolute. Their purpose is to subjugate society to moral law. And the purpose of moral law is to make individual flourishing possible.",1309370364

2710474,comment,2709834,2710369,10,0,jerf,,,"First, you assume without proof that Sarbanes-Oxley will actually prevent the next Enron. Goals aren't results. I do not accept this as unarguably obvious. The rule of thumb is that it is easier to undetectably game complex systems than simple ones.<p>Second, you've not mentioned the fact that Sarbanes-Oxley has real costs, not just in terms of direct compliance but also the business that they've simply shut out in advance because the businesses knew they couldn't afford compliance.<p>Finally, the <i>really</i> relevant metric is not merely ""How can we as a society purchase assurance against another Enron <i>at any cost</i>?"", but ""How can we as a society purchase assurance against Enron <i>in the most cost-effective manner</i>?"" I am deeply skeptical that SOX is the correct answer to this question, or even within spitting distance.<p>You've also implicitly bought into the political duality and assumed that if I'm not for it I must be in the ""conservative half"", even after I just said I'm libertarian quite nearby. I don't particularly care about whether it's ""liberal"" or ""conservative"" solutions, I care about working in the most cost-effective manner. SOX is almost certainly not it.<p>People are bad about accounting for disasters, people are <i>really really</i> bad at accounting for regulations.

You can't really be anonymous in a closed group. In a small closed group\nyou can't be anonymous at all (the degenerate case, two people, is obvious; writing style is an identifier in larger groups) and in a really large group the stakes of letting your mask slip are too high and will squelch serious conversation, while the lure of the big crowd will drive trolls and comedians.<p>B) To second order this could\nwork great. The second-order advantage of this is the <i>useful social fiction</i> of anonymity. Anonymity doesn't have to be cryptographically strong to be useful. Think: a masked ball. The masks aren't that highly effective - that seven-foot-tall masked woman is pretty easy to ID, mask or no - but if everyone plays along the game can go well. Plus, you can get <i>plausible deniability</i>, which can be very useful in social situations. (""No, it wasn't me who confessed that secret in anonymous chat. It must have been some other native speaker of Finnish from a basketball team in Toledo, Ohio."")<p>C) But, alas, I'm not sure use case (B) is significant enough to drive a product on its own.

I.e. If I look at someone who's 15 years ahead of my in the same career path and has done a good job of getting promoted, recognized and rewarded, am I happy doing what he's doing in 15 years?<p>A: No.<p>* Money and risk<p>Q: I'm 25 with 3 years of work experience at a major international bank, what's going to happen if I screw this up and waste 3 years of my life?<p>A: I'll get a job at 28. I'll probably make less money, but 3 years of work experience isn't too bad.<p>Q: What if you never get such a sweet job? USD 100k is a lot of money for a 25 year old!<p>A: I don't have kids, I don't have a mortgage, I don't have debts and I do have a enough savings to tide me over for a few years. It means that I won't live with the same degree of financial freedom (e.g. watching my spending, going on fewer holidays, eating out less, etc.) but it's a price I'm prepared to pay.<p>For most people, the last few questions are going to be the most important.

This article is a freakin' yo-yo. It causes heart disease, it does not cause heart disease, it causes cancer, it does not cause cancer, everyone is jumping on everyone else's methodology, and sometimes it seems as though the conclusions were decided before the study was performed.<p>Here it causes heart disease:<p>>a survey ,conducted in 1960, of 25,153 California Seventh-Day Adventists, found that the risk of heart disease is three times greater for 45-64 year old men who eat meat daily, versus those who did not eat meat.<p>Here it does not:<p>>In another study[84] in 2010 involving over one million people who ate meat found that only processed meat had an adverse risk in relation to coronary heart disease. The study suggests that eating 50g (less than 2oz) of processed meat per day increases risk of coronary heart disease by 42%, and diabetes by 19%. Equivalent levels of fat, including saturated fats, in unprocessed meat (even when eating twice as much per day) did not show any deleterious effects, leading the researchers to suggest that ""differences in salt and preservatives, rather than fats, might explain the higher risk of heart disease and diabetes seen with processed meats, but not with unprocessed red meats.""<p>The lack of attention given to statistical confounding in the diets of the people studied is concerning. The fact that new studies appear to refute previous studies suggests that one of three things is going on:<p>-the new studies are wrong<p>-the old studies are wrong<p>-the physical laws of the Universe have changed in some fundamental manner<p>I cannot hope to be convinced on this topic without hopefully a thorough examination of the methodology of the researchers and potential biases. It is not becoming of a scientist to make an assertion of knowledge without a thorough examination of the data and its origins, and I have my doubts about the quality of <i>any</i> of the current data, whether it condemns or acquits meat consumption. The work regarding heterocyclic amines and the recommendation to microwave meat before it is cooked seems now as a tiny ignored candle flame in a dark room full of people claiming to see the light.<p>I do, however, have the intuition that studying something as broad as ""meat consumption"" is almost inherently inclined to error and bias, and that it would be better to perform multiple specific analyses and hopefully even <i>experiments</i> involving perhaps directed diets, so that the question can be laid to rest, and people can make a decision based on evidence, fact, and their own relative valuation of health and hedonism.<p>Not from dogma.",1309369571

Perhaps similar to modern suggestions about policies for washing mugs, what sort of free coffee should be available in the breakroom, or if there should be a third bathroom for transgender. Things that don't represent any serious challenge to the existing order.<p>Then Mao made clear he really wanted criticism of the system and no one should hold back.

These criticisms were considered ""absurd"", the people were labelled trolls (""rightists""), rounded up, and executed in the Anti-Rightist Campaign.<p>If you want honest feedback from people, calling them trolls, with the implicit threat that criticism is wrong and should be eliminated, is not the way to get it.<p>The only way to have real honest feedback in a small group is to listen sincerely, and <i>eliminate punishment of dissidents</i>. This can only be done through trust, which is developed slowly and with difficulty. 99.99% of the time when corporate says to trust them and it's OK to make suggestions, they are lying and intend to identify and destroy anyone who seems to be a threat to their agenda.<p>I guarantee that if we collect a list of all the actual ""troll"" things that were said, most people outside your system will see significant numbers of them as representing valid criticism, and therefore unmask the truth that labeling the criticism ""trolls"" is an exercise of power to eliminate minority dissent.",1309369407

What I like most about Node.js is the feeling that you can be as close to the metal as you like. You don't have the endless boilerplate of every Java web framework, or the extensive ""magic"" of RoR. With Node and a framework like Express, you can understand things at the level of ""let me look at this HTTP request and decide how to respond to it."" This, to me, is beautiful:<p><pre><code>    app = require('express').createServer()\n\n    app.get '/', (req, res) ->\n      res.send 'hello world'\n\n    app.listen 3000\n</code></pre>\nIt's going to take more time to build a full-featured web app that way than with RoR or Django, but you'll understand it better and it'll scale well. For something that's only been around for two years, Node.js has a remarkable ecosystemyou can tell that a lot of very smart people are gravitating to it.<p>And yes, being able to use the same language for both your client-side and server-side code is pretty dang cool. It's also practical. Historically, development teams have tended to focus on the server-side and learn JS only well enough to hack together some jQuery into doing what they need on the front-end. The result has been a lot of buggy and lackluster front-end code. Node.js gives teams a compelling reason to master JavaScript, and to learn tools like CoffeeScript.

Grow it to a reasonable size across all you apps (a few hundred thousand and preferably a million or more) the larger your network of apps the easier it will be to promote you new apps and eventually you may get a runaway hit. Also, start out with small (2d) self contained (no client server stuff), polished, engaging FREE apps.<p>These types of apps are less expensive to produce (15-35k or 80-200 hours.)

After you learn some things about the market and start to build up your network of apps you can try doing some paid apps but unless you have an established brand I would recommend free + in app purchase for premium features. Some of your apps will do ok and some will be dogs. Learn from each and move on quickly.<p>Now if you already have an existing service with established user base (a few million at least) that is another story, go ahead and make an app that compliments your service and you might do ok since you already have a network of users and marketing muscle to promote it.

Managers have the power to do things like organize a ""DNA"" team, rewarding the best technical minds. Creating an elaborate organizational system with its own language is like deploying chaff.<p>Ultimately in any organization power originates from a legal source and fans outward via a network of trust relationships. The structure of the network is a hierarchy, with individuals closer to the source wielding more influence. It can be explicitly codified, or left implicit as is often the case in ""flat"" organizations.\nIn either case, the best way to move up the ladder is to become trusted by people closer to the source of power. This requires social aptitude, there is no substitute.<p>I think the flat vs hierarchy debate is pointless. Instead the debate should be about what kinds of people should have influence in a company? What standards should be communicated to ensure that smart latecomers quickly ascend the company's social network? Values, such as obedience and conformity, tend to reinforce the social hierarchy. Values like dissent and diversity create a more fluid social environment where trust relationships can be forged across different social strata in a company.<p>I think this social fluidity should be emphasized over ""flatness."" I'd much rather work in a fluid company than a flat one where people are binned into overly formalized teams of influence.

A stock is just a call at zero strike with infinite maturity. So you short a stock, you're just going short an instrument at some weight. The weight is the number of stocks you short. So you short 5 shares of google, the spot right now is 497 and the weight is minus five. So you do this with a bunch of equities ( google, apple, linkedin etc ). Then you obviously get a vector of spots and a vector of negative weights. The money you make is simply the inverse of the dot product of both vectors. What do you do with that money ? Obviously you don't sit on it. You buy protection on upside and speculate on downside simultaneously. ie. You buy  X OTM calls on goog, say at 550 strike the OTM call is 70 cents so you buy that. Then you speculate on the downside ie buy say Y 485 weekly put at 70 cents.<p>So if your bet is right, the Y puts make money, the X calls lose money, and overall you come out winner. You wait until google is say 487 and then buy back your shares making 10 buck per share plus the money off your Y puts minus the money from the X calls. So thats just another dot product ie. C = 5 times 10 + Y times a - X times b.<p>Now say the trade goes south. Then you lose on the put, lose on the short, but make money on the X calls, so the dot product looks like above but with different weights.\nIn either case, you can only lose a fixed sum worstcase ( so you statement "" there's no limit to your potential losses"" is definitely false ). So maximizing the money is then a constrained linear optimization problem.

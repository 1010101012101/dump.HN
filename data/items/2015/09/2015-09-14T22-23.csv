I currently work in distributed computing especially in the video domain and primarily have been interested in functional programming in the last few years - I&#x27;m currently a scala developer.<p>I&#x27;m wondering a couple things:<p>1) If I wanted to play with producing VSTs/AUs - especially instruments - are there any decent resources for getting into this specific problem domain? It seems a bit aloof relative to more prolific areas like distributed computing.<p>2) Are there any functional programming approaches - eg languages and libraries - that are widely used in audio DSP? I don&#x27;t think imperative languages would fit quite as well as functional programming as you can just string a signal through a series of functions, and re-arrange them to produce some sort of signal path - that seems logical to me from what I know of analog signal processing circuitry.<p>3) What sort of math would i want to get up to speed with if I was to venture in this direction? I&#x27;m assuming that there is a lot more mathematics that become apparent when working with digital audio and processing/altering it.<p>Thanks in advance for any insight - it&#x27;s hard to research the field as very little information appears to be available.

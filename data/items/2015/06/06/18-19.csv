9671807,comment,9671542,9671761,0,0,brighteyes,,,"This seems like a popular conspiracy theory. But in what way does it make sense? Yes, the numbers are close, but<p>1) Why not pick a larger number, if there is legal basis to ask for it? Is there a benefit to winning the exact amount they owe somewhere else, aside from trolling? More money would be better, wouldn&#x27;t it?<p>2) Why not pick a smaller number, if just a little, to avoid the similarity in the number (such similarities are noticed, as you are doing)?<p>It seems more likely that 2.7M is a number that they can justify legally. It may also have been justifiable legally in another lawsuit. Yes, it seems like an interesting coincidence. So what?<p>The same thing happened with the 16M figure from earlier in her trial - it appears both as a possible maximum willful damages number from her lawsuit, assuming she won, and somewhere in the legal proceedings of her husband&#x27;s hedge fund. Again, an interesting coincidence, but the same objections arise.<p>Overall, the fact that people pored through all the numbers in her lawsuit, and all the numbers in her husbands affairs (one lawsuit, one hedge fund fiasco), and found some dots to connect, seems to say more about people looking for patterns than about Pao and her husband.",1433617140

I understand and respect Richard Stallman, but I can&#x27;t agree with him on this subject.<p>How can you know that firmware is &quot;completely non-updateable&quot;? You trust the vendor with that, there&#x27;s no way to know for sure. What&#x27;s more - recently (~1.5y ago) somebody figured out how to update firmware of microSD cards [1]. Thanks to him, if we want to apply FSF&#x27;s point of view, microSD cards suddenly became unacceptable, non-free hardware, while before that blog post they were just fine.<p>I&#x27;m involved in development of Neo900 [2] phone and already had fair share of discussions about freedom and openness of components with various people. I was a part of Openmoko community in the past and remember the TI Calypso modem used inside Neo1973 and Neo Freerunner. At first they were non-updateable (for consumer), so were acceptable to RMS. Some time later Openmoko Inc. got firmware fixes for pretty annoying bugs like SIM compatibility and started trying to figure out how to distribute the updates. They obtained a license to redistribute the updater tool, provided the instructions and the firmware image. Suddenly, Neo Freerunner became non-free hw.<p>Then, some time later, partially thanks to Openmoko who provided the updater and instructions, OsmocomBB [3] was born (Harald Welte, who initiated OsmocomBB, also worked earlier in Openmoko). Suddenly Neo Freerunner became free again because there&#x27;s a free firmware available for Calypso now.<p>So my device I was carrying in my pocket, without any my intervention, went from free to non-free and to free back again. Fun!<p>Also, as a user who cares about his freedom, I prefer to have a hardware with updateable or even entirely user provided non-free firmware than a black-box with the same non-free firmware inside, but not updateable. Of course over that I&#x27;ll prefer a hw with open firmware, but in the case of the black box, there is even no hope that such a firmware will be provided in the future. And when at the same time you cannot be 100% sure that it really is non-updateable, then what&#x27;s the advantage? I can&#x27;t see any.<p>In theory, I can agree with FSF and RMS. In practice, hardware doesn&#x27;t really work that way.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.bunniestudios.com/blog/?p=3554"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bunniestudios.com/blog/?p=3554</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://neo900.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://neo900.org/</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://bb.osmocom.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bb.osmocom.org/</a>",1433617036

Though flashing firmware is rather uncommon, but using a specific device driver for the operating system is a lot more common - and then I can understand that there is a wish for more open source device drivers in the Unix/BSD world.<p>One usually rarely flashes the motherboard firmware (BIOS/EFI) or the graphic card firmware.

The same goes for the GSM/3G modem in your smartphone which is a separate real time OS on a separate ARM CPU. It&#x27;s a blob and one buys it and cannot change it.

There are open source projects that could make a difference, if they get more donations like: ReactOS which aims to be binary compatible with Windows NT series hardware drivers. And NDISwrapper, that recreated a partial Windows NT kernel (using ReactOS code) inside a Linux kernel making it possible to execute modern Windows drivers in Linux. It consists of a NTOSKRNL API, a basic WDM controller, and a set of Windows call wrappers such as Wireless/NDIS/USB/PnP to Linux APIs.",1433615771

For add-on cards, sure, but the line is not always that clear. Many are simply making do with the hardware they were gifted, or that is embedded, and so it&#x27;s an all-or-nothing scenario. The closed blob in question may be getting loaded for something the user can&#x27;t unplug or replace. Everything costs money, and not everyone can afford to throw away an imperfect choice and start again.<p>I can typically blacklist things, but I need to know they are there to begin with so, to me, the problem boils down to the kernel, and other software, potentially doing things that I don&#x27;t want. Since closed kernel blobs are clearly controversial, something as simple as highlighting their loading and making it as easy as possible to prevent it from happening on future boots may be enough. If the process is in place, it can be a simple lack of orientation - but Theo&#x27;s response certainly doesn&#x27;t help with that.<p>As for running blob-free in general... It&#x27;s not that hard, really. Often the only loss is fast 3D. Debian does a good job of separating free from non-free - and really, that is enough, since adding non-free items then becomes a conscious act (there can be other ways of making the distinction though).",1433615673
9671734,comment,9670829,9670829,0,0,IgorPartola,,,"The first issue mentioned is the disparity between maxconn as a global setting and as a backend setting, and it requires some more clarification. First, the article mentions that if global maxconn is reached, the new connections will remain queued in the socket&#x27;s listening queue. The length of this queue is finite and is specified by the listen() syscall&#x27;s backlog parameter. It appears that for recent versions of Linux this value defaults to 128, though in the past I have seen it much lower (on the order of 5). This means that if you set your maxconn to be, say, 256 and don&#x27;t change the default backlog value, you&#x27;ll get 384 connections connected or queued before the next client is refused.<p>To me it makes sense to set this value fairly high. There is not a great cost to holding a connection open: typically a few dozen bytes, but this way you can simply have your service working slower and catching up once the number of requests decreases. Say you set maxconn to 4096 globally and say the backend can process only 32 requests at a time. In this case you essentially buffer the client connections in the HAProxy (or whatever you use on the front-end) queue instead of outright refusing them. You still get all the benefits from the backend&#x27;s maxconn so the backend doesn&#x27;t start thrashing, but you accept a lot more connections before your users start seeing &quot;Server refused connection&quot; errors. Of course if you routinely need to process more than 32 concurrent requests your backend will never catch up, so in that case you want to increase its performance or add more backends.<p>Additionally, HAProxy is, AFAIK, the only HTTP/TCP server that has the option to log when a connection is first established, not when it is finalized, making it a lot easier to debug certain types of problems, as well as detecting Slowlaris attacks.",1433615650

Lower wages make it cheaper to produce those exports, and the benefit goes to buyers of those exports. The population is under wage pressure, and doesn&#x27;t believe that things will be better soon, so they spend less, and cannot support as many secondary and tertiary jobs. The overall population suffers, to the benefit of the countries that buy their exports, and to the benefit of the exporting companies (which is a smaller component of GDP than consumers, but probably better organized).<p>Also, once exported, the exporting country&#x27;s citizens do not enjoy the use and benefit of the exported item.<p>- A program of spending is intended to boost the spending ability of consumers. Consumers are more confident, and are more likely to support secondary and tertiary jobs through their spending. The benefit is to the citizens and businesses of the country.

Let&#x27;s leave that aside and assume that the spaceship and all its information is truly lost when it leaves our bubble. Then the question of whether that spaceship still exists is not a sensible question in physics, because there is no experiment that can confirm or deny it. It&#x27;s a metaphysical/philosophical question. My point is that BOTH the claim that it disappears AND the claim that it does not disappear aren&#x27;t sensible. Many worlds says that if you observe the alive cat, there still exists some other version of you that observes the dead cat. That is a metaphysical claim. Copenhagen says that there is no other version of you that observes the dead cat. This is also a metaphysical claim. I say that both claims are silly if you truly believe in the predictions of quantum mechanics. Whether the other version of the cat still exists is not a question worth worrying about, like it&#x27;s not worth worrying about whether an invisible god exists or not. The simplest theory is to make no claim either way.<p>By the way, many worlds by itself is not actually a complete theory. It simply says that the wavefunction of the entire universe evolves according to the rules of quantum mechanics. To actually get predictions out of it you have to say something extra about observers within that universe.

9671699,comment,9652269,9654209,0,0,cbsmith,,,"The origins of the treaty trace back to 2002, and the US formally joined negotiations in January 2008. Later that year, Susan C. Schwab (an appointee under then President GWB) announced to the world that the US was entering in to negotiations to join it. It is entirely possible the treaty won&#x27;t be ratified until the next President is in office (or never).<p>There are 12 countries that are actively involved in the negotiations, of which four signed on to the original TPSEP in 2005, and 8 were formally involved in negotiations before Obama ever entered the White House. What we know of the negotiations show that the US is looking for terms very different from the other nations, which at least creates a realistic possibility that much of what is in the treaty agreement is not what the US, let alone President Obama, would want. In the end, the negotiations are driven by apolitical business interests (which you can take as a positive or negative, I think a reasonable case can be made that it is neither).<p>No question he&#x27;s been involved in negotiations, promoting it and in favour of it. His administration has obviously played a significant role in negotiations.<p>But this thing is way, way bigger than any President. The forces driving the negotiation cross at least a dozen nations and both the Republican & Democratic parties in the US. Suggesting it is Obama&#x27;s deal is to completely misrepresent the scope and nature of the deal, the process by which it is structured, and creates a mythos of it being a part of a domestic partisan political agenda.",1433614990

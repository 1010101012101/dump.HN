One of my favorite passages is the following, which is the source of the title of the chapter:<p><pre><code>  We came to a certain book, part of a set of three supplementary books published by\n  the same company, and they asked me what I thought about it.\n\n  I said, ""The book depository didn't send me that book, but the other two were nice.""\n\n  Someone tried repeating the question: ""What do you think about that book?""\n\n  ""I said they didn't send me that one, so I don't have any judgment on it.""\n\n  The man from the book depository was there, and he said, ""Excuse me; I can explain\n  that. I didn't send it to you because that book hadn't been completed yet.\n  There's a rule that you have to have every entry in by a certain time, and the\n  publisher was a few days late with it. So it was sent to us with just the covers,\n  and it's blank in between. The company sent a note excusing themselves and\n  hoping they could have their set of three books considered, even though the third\n  one would be late.""\n\n  It turned out that the blank book had a rating by some of the other members! They\n  couldn't believe it was blank, because [the book] had a rating. In fact, the\n  rating for the missing book was a little bit higher than for the two others. The\n  fact that there was nothing in the book had nothing to do with the rating.</code></pre>",1258869550

955453,comment,955239,955420,0,0,randallsquared,,,"<i>Island in the Sea of Time</i> was published in 1998, and spawned a sub-genre.  Speaking of Stirling, his series The Domination is in the same class as <i>Ender's Game</i> and <i>Dune</i>, at least, for world-building, and the first one was published in 1988, per wikipedia.<p><i>Accelerando</i> has more scope than most of those you mention.<p>Other books in that class would include <i>Snow Crash</i>, <i>A Fire Upon the Deep</i> and the sequel <i>A Deepness in the Sky</i>... Hm. It's true that most of those I can think of right now are from the early part of the last 20 years (or the first one of the series is).  Maybe that's because that was the end of the SF era, as you suggest, or maybe it's for some other reason (I've been an adult a little less than 20 years, which may bias me; it may be that lots of books of the past ten years will be considered important, but they require distance; something else?).",1258868867

This would reduce the actual message transmission, in cases of mistaken identity, to a few (16-32) bytes each time.

You will find some titles by Heinlein and Clarke, but a lot of the shelfspace in the SF section will be devoted to various media tie-ins, such as Star Trek, Star Wars and X-Men.  There will also be plenty of fantasy novels, mostly dealing with vampires or with settings that Tolkien first created more than half a century ago.  You will need to look very hard to find something interesting.<p>The situation with short stories is also dire.  For example, Analog went from 115,000 issues per month in the early 1980s to a little over 30,000 in 2006 (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog_Science_Fiction_and_Fact#Circulation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog_Science_Fiction_and_Fact...</a>).  In recent months, the Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction had to switch to a bimonthly schedule in order to rein in their costs.<p>Part of the problem is that people don't read for pleasure as much as they used to.  Editors and publishers want to print what they think the public wants.  Right now, it seems that the public wants Tolkien knock-offs, manga and Batman.  The average person's exposure to SF is through the movies, television or video games, not the written word.",1258866745

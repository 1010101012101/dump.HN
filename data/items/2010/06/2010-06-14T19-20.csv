So that's where the Bananaphone song got its superpowers from!"" ><<p>On a more serious note, I do love everyday comparisons that everyone can understand. For example, science books for kids measuring things in elephants or houses. It's a comparison they can understand. It's like scaling things down for your brain. They're good tools to detect nonsense, too. Take antivaccinationists. For example, they do talk a lot about ""toxins"" in vaccines - like formaldehyde. Sounds dangerous, doesn't it? Except... That the average pear has about fifty times the formaldehyde in it, and formaldehyde is naturally present in your body in the first place. Then there's the mercury preservative mostly gone from vaccines anyway - gone in a matter of days, since ethyl mercury is easily passed. The methyl mercury from that tuna salad you ate a month ago is still in your body. But when a non-scientific person just hears ""mercury"" or ""formaldehyde""...",1276545551
1430778,comment,1429634,1430051,0,0,jtheory,,,"About falling back into old habits -- you have to give those old habits some respect.  The very act of sinking down in the couch and grabbing the remote -- and letting yourself be dragged into a 2 hour waste of time -- is something with roots that probably run much deeper than you realize.<p>You can't usually break old habits by just, you know, deciding <i>for real this time</i> that you aren't going to let it happen anymore.  Sure, that works for one decision (10:05am) and maybe even a bunch of them (10:09am, 10:43am, 10:44am, 11:05am...) but how long can you keep winning those battles through force of will alone?  Your will gets tired.<p>You have to take physical steps to make it impossible.  If you give away your TV, that's a real-world step that would force you out of that particular addiction (and believe me, TV is addicting... there are an awful lot of very smart people who've worked for decades making it that way).  I haven't had a TV since 2002 or so, and I've never intend to get another.  So that's one down.<p>I still find plenty of ways to waste time even when my work is my own, and interesting to me -- I'm doing it right now! -- but once you've successfully knocked down your most serious distractions it gets a little easier to see how it all works.  Personally, I cut out TV and any and all gaming a long time ago (because they just short-circuit my brain, it seems... I get sucked in even if I'm not enjoying myself at all), and most of my time-wasters that are left aren't so impossible to resist -- so I can use some of the methods other posters are talking about.<p>Making lists (and explicitly reprioritizing) is great -- sometimes when you hit a roadblock that would normally have you popping open a ""timewasting"" browser window, or wandering off to the kitchen, if instead you grab the paper & pen and go outside you can either scribble your way through the problem step by step, OR realize that you don't have to solve it at all (or, not yet).<p>When you need a break, walks are also great -- instead of something like TV (which fills your head with stuff that completely blocks most useful thought) you can just follow your feet for a bit, enjoy the weather (there are pleasant aspects to most weather) and clear your head and your thinking.<p>Also allow yourself time to recharge (again, TV is bad for this because it fills up your head with a flood of images and messages designed to stick there...) but hanging out with friends & loved ones is great, getting outside is great, going for a run is great.<p>One final thought -- if you actually make some changes (like blocking web access part of the day, tossing the TV, etc.) it takes a while before you actual benefit from the changes -- you'll keep popping from your chair and heading to the TV for a good while, for example, or find yourself pacing around just thinking furiously about whatever time-wasting thing you'd <i>normally</i> have been doing at that moment.",1276545546

Usually, the factor that enables a country to resist corruption from natural resources comes from having a proper governance system already in place.<p>Even something that many perceive as trivial, like tax collection, is essential. Because what often happens is, a nation will not collect taxes and instead say they will let the riches from natural resources trickle down to the citizenry. This enables dictatorships/political elites to remain entrenched at their expense.<p>You also need government agencies in place to make sure that surveys are being conducted properly so that the auction process can be optimized.<p>I remember a story about an African nation that needed to auction off mining rights. Their data was well over 100 years old, whereas some MNC mining companies had state of the art testing, as a result there was asymmetrical information that worked against their government.<p>One way to circumvent that lack of information is to auction permits in a rolling manner.

There are many questions like this on Stackoverflow, be sure to check those answers, too.<p>Deciding on what to learn is hard, however, deciding on which one to choose from a list of things is much easier. The important aspects are (in order of importance IMO): (i) How does this help with my bottom line, i.e. will knowing this technology earn me money (ii) How ""sexy"" is it, is in on the bleeding edge, when I list this on my resume, will it catch the eye? (iii) How's the community, are they helpful, do they answer newbie questions? (iv) How's the documentation? (v) Is this a dead-end thing, or will it lead me into learning new things?<p>If I had to name just <i>one</i> thing, I would say Javascript. It used to be that ""real men don't use Javascript"", but the latest prominence of web apps is changing that. Also JS has gained a lot of respect for its advanced notions. I would recommend : JavaScript The Goof Parts, it's an easy read. Learn JQuery (and node.js for advanced stuff)<p>I would add Google web toolkit to the tool bag. This way, you can build complex apps with your Java knowledge, without being a JavaScript guru.<p>Learn a mobile platform. My personal choice is Android. iPhone has better potential but is kind of saturated. And it's Java, so you don't have to learn Objective C.<p>Why not Processing? It's extremely easy to pick up, has tons of interesting tutorials/demos and is easily lends itself to creating mind-blowing visualizations in a short time.<p>I would also start learning a offbeat thing, something that will raise eyebrows while reading your resume and will make it stand out. Could be scheme (learning it know, awesome!), clojure (runs on the JVM), Lua (has always got a life of its own but getting more coverage lately, can run on Android), or if you want to really go all the way, Forth. These will probably not earn you money but will expand your mind.<p>You can also look into getting your feet dirty with hardware. For years, I've been afraid to do this (I absolutely hate hardware stuff) but Arduiono or the Beagle Board are great.<p>And one final thing: Learn git! That's where all the good stuff is.",1276543669

(latter on the other side of the board) with 4 ASICs each handing all the rest of a motherboard's IO, virtualizing it (e.g. each core sees 4 virtual SATA drives).  That's why each board needs 2 x16 PCIe connections, the backplane has a fancy supercomputer style torus topology interconnect, and you can put up to 64 physical disks in front.  Lots of Ethernet out the back and there's an FPGA system for the backplane, which might be due to the small number of units but will give them lots of flexibility.",1276542247

The scientists gleefully explained this result to basketball pundits; the pundits remained non-plussed and unconvinced. (Surprised?)""<p>Yes, I am surprised. The article makes good points but <i>its</i> fallacy is applying mathematical abstractions to the real world. Now, there are real-world phenomena that are closer to the assumptions made by the dependency assumption in the coin tossing (Bernoulli) trials, e.g. rolling real dice. However, player performance is complex and <i>does</i> depend on previous history; for example a player who did badly in the previous game or missed an important shot will be under pressure this time, which will affect his performance.<p>The model in this case is too simplistic, a Markov model may be a better approach perhaps. However, estimating the Markov order of a given time series is a hard problem.",1276542229

At 1 cent increments if bidding itself costs 1 cent. By the time the price reaches 100 bucks you already made 100 dollars in bids along. But bidding usually costs 5 cents per 1 cent bid so you already made 500 dollars on a 100 dollar auction + 100 dollars for sale.",1276542073

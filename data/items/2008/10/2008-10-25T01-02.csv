This can cut into territory like Cision's for media database lists considering users of the site actively generate content.<p>A few questions/tips;<p>1.Can I cull some of my other SNS information and port it to your site? Maybe even just an OpenID or Clickpass account?<p>2.Have you done any self-marketing yet, perhaps even reaching out to the larger agencies for a live demo? May be a nice idea to generate interest at a target market.<p>I'd be happy to have you guys demo something in the future.<p>Oh, one other thing in terms of an idea: Set private networks based on agency email address.<p>So, as I said above, take my comments for what they are worth on a BB, but I'll check the site out in more detail. Just wanted to add here that this is a very good niche for something like this. Good luck!",1224899301

343237,comment,342358,342660,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"There seems to be much more to it than just that though. From Krugman:<p>""Second, again like Reagan, Bush has used the government's power to make it harder for workers to organize. The National Labor Relations Board, founded to protect the ability of workers to organize, has become for all practical purposes an agent of employers trying to prevent unionization. A spectacular example of this anti-union bias came just a few months ago. Under U.S. labor law, legal protections for union organizing do not extend to supervisors. But the Republican majority on the NLRB ruled that otherwise ordinary line workers who occasionally tell others what to do -- such as charge nurses, who primarily care for patients but also give instructions to other nurses on the same shift -- will now be considered supervisors. In a single administrative stroke, the Bush administration stripped as many as 8 million workers of their right to unionize.""<p>You can't simply explain the death of unions by saying manufacturing has gone overseas. Those jobs were replaced by retail and service industry ones which, in the 70s, were also largely unionized. Now they're not. Why?",1224899161

Having many seperate governments whose jurisdictions you cross daily can be very inefficient.<p>On the basic level we can have reduced problems hiring & selling to people across several countries. On higher levels we can actually deal with things like climate change or internet regulations (or avoiding regulations) in a better way.<p>Climate change is (i think) a strong example of this need. There is general acceptance of a need to do something but a very weak decision making & execution body.",1224898934
343231,comment,343210,343210,0,0,e1ven,,,"Like Everything else- It depends..<p>Does it fulfill a new and unique roll or is it mostly a similar implementation as existing frameworks?<p>For example- GWT and Cappuccino bring something new and interesting to the space- Program in either Java, or an Obj-C like language.. There are a lot of decent ways to write web code using Java- Spring is very popular for plumbing..<p>So the question comes down to.. What do you offer that no one else does?<p>The second question is, How much effort do you want to put into supporting this? It sounds like you've developed an application, and then pulled the framework out from it.. (Not a bad policy at all. Look at 37Signals and Rails)<p>If it's not your core product, and you'd be giving it away, how much time and effort do you want to invest in writing documentation, test cases, examples, etc?<p>How much time do you want to spend ensuring that a stable version remains consistent for years, rather than being able to upgrade the framework when necessary?<p>It could certainly gain publicity and popularity if it 'took off', but that goes back to the first two questions.<p>I think your poll questions are the wrong ones, to be honest.. How can anyone answer if they'd use it, before they know the unique selling points, and what it brings to a table.<p>How long is a piece of string?<p>On the other hand,",1224898860

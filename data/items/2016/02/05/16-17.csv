In contrast, the entire set off Lithium Ion battery needs to be connected to the grid to take advantage of its storage, you can &quot;pump&quot; Redox Flow batteries into storage tanks to increase capacity without increasing power.<p>For day/night cycle storage (or longer), I&#x27;d expect Redox Flow to be more cost efficient than Lithium Ion, despite LiIon having numerous advantages (density / power / etc. etc.). Mainly because you can save on &quot;Power Output&quot; and instead build larger and larger tanks to store the charged electrolyte.<p>LiIons get more and more expensive ($$$ per KW-hr storage) the &quot;bigger&quot; they get. Redox Flow batteries achieve scalability (cheaper $$$ per KW-hr the bigger they get). I do realize I&#x27;m imprecisely using the word &quot;bigger&quot;, but I hope yall will forgive me on that :-)<p>My personal favorites:<p>1. Pumped Hydro -- Old technology, but a favorite of mine. Very simple design, just take advantage of lakes that already exist in your vicinity and use the water in the lake as a gravity storage device.<p>2. Flywheels -- Store energy by spinning a heavy object. Spin-spin-spin... spinning and gyroscopes are cool.<p>3. Vanadium  Redox Flow Battery -- Liquid batteries, how cool is that?",1454691536

The speed version hasn&#x27;t been true for single core performance for years.<p>> You are asking us to believe the recent past means that we will not get more single cpu performance increases over the next 10-20 years.*<p>Moore&#x27;s law is put in specific time terms -- transistors/power(speed) should double every 18 months. So if this hasn&#x27;t been the case for the recent 2-3 years, then Moore&#x27;s Law is already broken -- no belief required. The fact that it&#x27;s very possible we&#x27;ll might see another CPU speed breakthrough in, say, 2022 or 2028 or 2050 doesn&#x27;t change that -- as Moore&#x27;s Law talks about sustained improvements over 18 month periods.<p>Besides, few in the industry disagree that the Moore Law is pretty much over. That&#x27;s a great motive behind all the talk of optimizing multicore performance, functional techniques etc.<p>><i>And you&#x27;re saying that a 20%-30% (6x-13x) improvement over then next 10 years won&#x27;t make a big difference? If Atom was 10x faster, would it be more useable?</i><p>As already said, this 20-30% is &quot;at best&quot; and covers specific benchmarks and uses, not general speed. And nobody said this is sustainable long term either. After a JIT engine reaches a specific point of sophistication, there are few things that one can add to make it even faster.",1454691458

Normative slow policy change means it is just as slow to implement adverse policies as well, giving time for citizens to put in the effort and time to roll it back just as slowly. Hence Benjamin Franklin&#x27;s &quot;...if you can keep it&quot; quip.<p>What we see as alarming, fast-paced changes today are the culmination of <i>generations</i> of dogged efforts at policy changes frequently made opportunistically rather than specifically goal-directed, incubating emergent adverse behavior given rise by generations of insufficient citizen participation assiduously maintaining the republic&#x27;s edifice.<p>The US political arena has its version of Usenet&#x27;s Eternal September, where newcomers arrive (often timed to presidential elections) in a fresh, eager batch putting in tons of time and effort, then ebb like the tide when they don&#x27;t see the results they anticipated (forgetting Bismarck&#x27;s dictum that &quot;Politics is the art of the possible, the attainable — the art of the next best.&quot;) within 1-4 years. Only a smattering remain to welcome the next batch.

I haven&#x27;t experienced it first-hand (and I&#x27;m probably just now approaching the age where it might be a factor, and I haven&#x27;t looked for a full-time job in a couple of decades), but I know several folks who have. Even when they&#x27;ve been willing to take lower salaries, when applying for startups, in particular, older folks often get passed over. It gets called things like &quot;cultural fit&quot;, etc.<p>But, the thing is, we&#x27;re talking about a &quot;low six-figure salary&quot; here, which is not <i>that high</i> for engineering work. In fact, in many markets, it&#x27;s the baseline for anyone with more than a couple of years experience. I can&#x27;t believe salary is the primary motivating factor, if it is a reasonable salary, well within the bounds of expected pay for people with experience.<p>I haven&#x27;t been in the job market since I was quite young (I&#x27;ve run my own companies since my 20s, with some contract work along the way to make ends meet), but, I know my dad experienced this to some degree; and he was an engineer in an industry that was not nearly as ageist as high tech fields often are (he worked in the oil and gas industry). His salary climbed through his 30s and 40s, and then finding work became more difficult in his 50s, and he retired early partly due to health issues, but also because of difficulty finding good long-term work.<p>I don&#x27;t think salary is the only factor here, especially given that most of the folks I know who&#x27;ve experienced this aren&#x27;t insisting on making more than their peers doing the same work. The people motivated by money tend to rise up to management roles. The engineers who are driven by the desire to build things just want to make a decent salary while being in an environment where they get to build things. The most productive software engineer I think I&#x27;ve ever worked with was in his late 50s, and was making less than a number of developers in the company (but he had a private office and a few other perks that no one else got, and got to work on stuff that excited him, so he seemed reasonably content).",1454690850

I try to optimize my code around reducing state, coupling, complexity and code, in that order. I&#x27;m willing to add increased coupling if it makes my code more stateless. I&#x27;m willing to make it more complex if it reduces coupling. And I&#x27;m willing to duplicate code if it makes the code less complex. Only if it doesn&#x27;t increase state, coupling or complexity do I dedup code.<p>The reason I put stateless code as the highest priority is it&#x27;s the easiest to reason about. Stateless logic functions the same whether run normally, in parallel or distributed. It&#x27;s the easiest to test, since it requires very little setup code. And it&#x27;s the easiest to scale up, since you just run another copy of it. Once you introduce state, your life gets significantly harder.<p>I think the reason that novice programmers optimize around code reduction is that it&#x27;s the easiest of the 4 to spot. The other 3 are much more subtle and subjective and so will require greater experience to spot. But learning those priorities, in that order, has made me a significantly better developer.",1454689231

As Apple doesn&#x27;t officially recommend third-party batteries, this means in consequence, that you would be obliged to throw away the machine.<p>I told one of my customers, who has a lot of MacBooks in his company, about this.

You drag the day&#x27;s orders around to arrange them on the trucks as you like (also you can drag the trucks around, and each truck was a list of orders with a scroll bar).  Each truck shows its current capacity and turns red if the capacity is exceeded.  Each order shows its delivery address and size (plus you can click on it to view the whole thing).  When you are done, you click a button to print the pull tickets, bills of lading and delivery tickets all in the right order.

11042330,comment,11042110,11042263,0,0,beau26,,,"Text:<p>After more than 20 years as an electronics engineer, Pete Edwards reached the low six-figure pay level. Now, as he looks for a job following a layoff, he finds that salary success a burden.<p>Although his experience includes the sought-after field of 3-D printing, the 53-year-old hasn’t been able to land a permanent full-time job. Time and again, he says, employers seem to lose interest after he answers a question that they ask early on: “What was your last salary?”<p>That question comes up sooner than ever nowadays. Hiring managers used to broach salary history or requirements only in later stages, after applicants had a chance to make an impression and state their case.<p>Today, pay increasingly is mentioned early in the process, either as a required field in online applications—which are used more often—or during initial interviews, say recruiters, compensation consultants and job seekers.<p>The shift is vexing applicants, mostly those of a certain age and pay level, who are concerned that a salary they worked to attain now gets in the way of having a job at all. “I’m unemployable now as a result of getting to the top of the tree,” Mr. Edwards lamented.<p>ENLARGE\nJosh Rock, a recruiter at Fairview Health Services, a 20,000-employee health system in Minnesota, said that during the last recession, recruiters used compensation queries as a quick way to cull the large numbers of candidates for open jobs. The habit has stuck, he said. “Why not figure out what’s going on sooner in the process than doing a dance?”<p>Human-resources executives say asking about pay right off the bat helps contain compensation costs, ensures that candidates have reasonable expectations and spares recruiters from chasing prospects they can’t afford.<p>“Unfortunately, some clients use salary as a pre-screening question,” said Susan Vitale, chief marketing officer at iCIMS Inc., a provider of recruiting software in Matawan, N.J. “So if the role tops out at $55,000 and they say they want $60,000, it might knock the candidate out of consideration” even if the person would be open to salary negotiations.<p>Screening candidates this way may be a factor in wage stagnation, some analysts suggest. Average hourly earnings rose 2.5% in 2015, modest by historical standards. Wage growth has averaged only about 2% for the past five years.<p>Focusing on compensation history “holds down wages because now the jobs are being filled by people with lower salary expectations,” said Thomas Kochan, a professor of employment research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Sloan School of Management. “We have a whole generation of people who are permanently adversely affected.”<p>ENLARGE\nThough hiring tactics have received little attention in the economic debate about wage stagnation, Mr. Kochan said they could have profound effects: “The decisions of firms individually are…creating collectively this macro phenomenon of stagnation,” yet are hard to measure because they are shrouded in secrecy.<p>U.S. employers continue to hold the line on wages despite six years of economic recovery and an unemployment rate of 5%. Finance chiefs are “probably looking ahead and saying they want to keep the escalation of labor costs from going up in a way that will put pressure on earnings,” said Ajit Kambil, global research director of Deloitte’s CFO Program.<p>In Deloitte’s most recent quarterly survey, 47% of chief financial offers said they plan to work to lower or control labor costs this year, by taming compensation growth, reducing benefit costs or other means. Moreover, employers may feel they can lowball applicants because they believe there is still a surplus of qualified candidates.<p>“Workers are still a little discounted” in most fields, said Linda Barrington, executive director of the Institute for Compensation Studies at Cornell University’s ILR School. “Employers won’t pay what the last person in the job was paid because labor is now on sale.”<p>Steve Carpinelli recently applied for a public-relations position with a nonprofit organization in Washington, D.C. The role called for a minimum of five-to-seven years of experience. He has more than 14.<p>RELATED<p>How to Field Questions About Salary Expectations\nMr. Carpinelli’s pay reached high five figures before the 45-year-old switched to the generally lower-paying field of nonprofits. While preparing for a phone interview with the Washington organization, he discovered that the last person in the job earned $101,000. So when asked early on about his salary expectations, he put his range squarely around what the last employee earned, seeking $85,000 to $110,000.<p>“After that, the conversation was very robotic, not a two-way conversation about what they’re truly looking for,” Mr. Carpinelli said. “I definitely got the impression that I’d priced myself out.”<p>In his experience, “there has been a definite shift or emphasis on beginning the conversation with: ‘What is your salary range?’” Mr. Carpinelli said. “I was always told you never talk about salary until you’re given an offer. But I’ve noticed the salary-range question comes up far earlier in the conversation.”<p>The organization ultimately hired a young woman with five years’ experience. Mr. Carpinelli is still looking for a permanent job.<p>Older job seekers sometimes see such outcomes as evidence of bias. But “employers can make financial decisions and it’s not necessarily age discrimination,” said Raymond Peeler, a senior attorney-advisor at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. “What an employee would have to prove…is that the employer is using the salary level as a proxy to disqualify all the older applicants.”<p>Businessolver Inc., a benefits-administration firm in West Des Moines, Iowa, recently hired more than 100 people for its Denver office. Human-resources staffers ask about compensation in the middle of a six-step hiring process and use the answers to gauge applicants’ “level of reality,” said Marcy Klipfel, senior vice president of HR. “A lot of times what you’re looking at is are we going to waste time and get to the end of the process, and it turns out the person is way out of our range?”<p>A majority of workers take a salary cut when they get a new job after a stretch of unemployment, but those over 45 usually take a bigger hit than workers under 35 years of age, according to research from Ms. Barrington and a Cornell colleague, Hassan Enayati.<p>A survey by AARP last year found that of job seekers between 45 and 70 years old who found work after a spell of unemployment, nearly half earned less than before.<p>Some employers hesitate to hire at far below a past salary, concerned that the employee would resent earning so much less. “If someone wants $100,000 and settles for $75,000, they’re not going to be happy,” said Steve Gross, a compensation specialist and senior partner at consulting firm Mercer.<p>Workers, however, say they would like the chance to decide for themselves.<p>“The presumption that I would walk into a job and get $150,000 is not there,” said Rosemary Lynch Kelleher, a baby boomer who has earned at that level during her 25-year career in international trade policy, and has been looking for a permanent job for several years.<p>“I realize very clearly that it’s not there. And I would take something for $100,000 or $75,000.”<p>In Austin, a woman who lost her six-figure position as a data architect in 2014 but recently landed a job, said she had been tempted to say she earned $60,000 to improve her chances of getting hired.<p>While she was searching, the 63-year-old said: “I hate putting down what I want” in salary. “If you put down too much, they think you’re expensive. If you don’t put down enough, they think you’re undervaluing yourself.”<p>Much of this ambiguity could be avoided if employers published a pay range for positions, but they don’t want to tip their hands. So experts suggest job seekers research market rates for particular positions and try to finesse salary questions.<p>“Say, ‘I’m open to a salary commensurate with the job,” recommended Blake Nations, a former recruiter who was laid off and then founded Over50JobBoard.com. “And if they keep going, ask: ‘What do you expect to pay someone with my experience and education for this position?’ ”<p>Some applicants, faced with a salary-history question they fear would exclude them from the start, have toyed with putting a bogus number in a required field in an online form.<p>Mr. Edwards, the electronics engineer, says he tried that once. Not hearing back from the company, he contacted its HR department and was told he was too expensive. That baffled him because he had listed $1,000 as his previous pay. It turned out HR had changed that to $100,000, assuming it was a mistake.",1454688693

2729427,comment,2727457,2727982,2,0,tytso,,,"Well, not <i>all</i> infrastructure work is confidential.  I work on the Production Linux team at Google, and we're quite open about a lot of the work we do, and we try to push as much as possible of the work we do upstream.<p>I do have to second this thing about the ""celebrity programmer"".  We have a group of people working on ext4, some of whom have been working on it at Google before I decided to start working there.  (In fact, I learned about Google adopting ext4 from their contributions of no-journal mode for ext4 to the upstream.)   I may be one of the more visible persons at Google, but I'm certainly not the only one working on ext4, and ext4 wouldn't be where it is today without some really talented folks who have been working on it with me for the last 2-3 years --- and I've only been at Google for 18 months!<p>One of the reasons why I am at Google is precisely because it is a big company.  It is only when have a very, very large number of machines in your data center does it make sense to put a whole team of people working on infrastructure code such as file systems.   (I'm pretty confident, by the way, that Sun never recouped all of the money they poured into ZFS --- it's a project which is highly impressive from a business perspective, but from a business person's ROI perspective, not so much.)<p>One of the things I can definitely say about Google is that while it may be a large company, compared to IBM, it has a minuscule amount of bureaucracy.  I used to sit on the team that worked on the annual budget for the Linux Technology Center, and that would be weeks and weeks of conference calls where the ROI of work items at the granularity of 6 to 12 persons months worth of effort for the next fiscal year would be weighed, judged, and decided.   Which is something I'm glad IBM does as a shareholder --- but as someone who had to sit on those interminable conference calls, not so much.   I get to do far more real, honest coding work at Google than I did at MIT (where I spent the bulk of my time on Lotus Notes, PowerPoint via Crossover Office, and conference calls.)    The one good thing about having gone through a very dispassionate review on the ROI of various different bits of technical work is I can say with fairly great authority that there is huge amounts of work which makes sense from an ROI perspective for me (and a whole team besides) to do at Google, but which wouldn't make sense at most other companies, just because of the scale at which it operates.<p>If you are interested in working on very large scale systems problems, Google is definitely one of the best places in the world for you to do this kind of stuff.   I know a tenured faculty member at Harvard who decided that it was far more fun to do systems work at Google, and who left his tenured faculty position for this reason.",1309864926

Commenting here because I feel chased out of my own blog. I'm trying to figure out if I want to write a follow-up blog post, and if so, what I would write in it. More importantly, who would I be writing it for? There may be some catharsis for me in writing a response, but it would also involve me stewing in asshat soup for even longer while I composed it.<p>The main thing I would want to clarify is that the technical problems are not actually the heart of the matter for me. Being responsible parents, we set Alex's email up in such a way that we get copies of all his incoming messages. We can probably reconstruct large chunks of his correspondence to date. I'm not even sure if Alex thinks of email as a long-term thing, though. He archives messages, but I don't know if he considers them anything other than ephemeral.<p>Secondly, we can set him up with a new email account somewhere else. No problem. Offline, IMAP, webmail, whatever. That's easy. (Although I would very much prefer not to have to run my own email server, in the same way that I prefer not to fix the engine of my own car.) Alternatively, we can just do what everyone else does, and simply lie. It wouldn't be the first time, and it won't be the last. (#include relevant discussions of ""legal"" vs. ""moral"".)<p>What really made me angry was the emotional harm. I don't like using that phrase, because for me it brings to mind stereotypical unreasonable lawsuits, but that's what it is. An authority figure in Alex's life turned round and damn near bit his hand off, when Alex thought he was following that figure's instructions. It feels like a violation of trust. No matter whether we get his old email back, the original violation remains. Hence the title of my post: Google made my son cry. When you hurt my kid, I get angry.<p>I completely understand that Google's hands are tied because of COPPA. As soon as they knew that Alex was younger than 13, they had to act, and they can't ""un-know"" that information. My instinct says that this is an unintended consequence, though. I find it hard to imagine that ""weeding out underage Gmail users"" was listed as a goal on the G+ rollout plan.<p>What would make me happy, as a parent (first of all) and as an interaction designer (because I find it hard to leave the professional side behind)? What would make this right?<p>* If 13 is the hard age limit for using Gmail, Google should ask for your age when you sign up for a Gmail account. That way, you know in advance you're going to have to lie, rather than having the truth come up and bite you in the ass two years later.<p>* Instead of the harsh, default TOS violation message, a sympathetic and apologetic error message tuned for the specific circumstance of discovering that you are too young to use the service. Think about it. In this specific case, what do you know about the user? You know that they're a child. Design for this. Error messages are bad enough for grown-ups; they're double-bad for kids.<p>* The option to retrieve Alex's old email, instead of just discarding it.<p>* The option for us to give parental consent for Alex to have a Gmail account. I love Gmail. I would much rather Alex had a Gmail account than that we have to arse about with Thunderbird and our own IMAP server.<p>* Even if there is nothing they can do, an apology would be nice. Just because they're legally in the right, doesn't mean that they feel good about it. Show this.""",1309864561

It turns out that some points cannot be made in one Tweet, just as other points cannot be made in seven minutes.<p>And you need to be a bit more generous to those who still admire fine old art forms like the classic long lecture. It is a genre. It used to be <i>the</i> genre, and now it is just one, but the masters of the big lecture were and are great, and a lot of them aren't going to master the new genre - they were born too late, perhaps - so enjoy them for what they are. Use the high-speed button if you must.<p>All that said: Yes, you're right, the central awesomeness of Khan is not Khan himself or his lectures - people have rightly pointed out that Khan isn't the teacher to end all teachers - but his relentless pushing of this new genre, a genre that relies on the presence of ubiquitous handheld portable video players. In a world where everyone on the bus and in line at the supermarket has a smartphone, a traditional lecture, with lots of throat-clearing and repetition and class mechanics (""before I tell you anything useful let me talk about the TA assignments"") and a long recap at the start of every lecture to let the people who slept through the last lecture catch up... it's tedious. Cut out half of it, deliver the rest in chunks, build a replay system that makes it easy to navigate to and play the individual chunks, and suddenly you're in the 21st century. I've been waiting for this to happen ever since I first used YouTube, and countless YouTube teachers have pioneered the technique; Khan is finally doing the evangelization.<p>I keep wishing, probably in vain, that TV would go the same way. I put off watching <i>Mythbusters</i> for years because I just couldn't stand the editing: shows are edited for people who tune in and out constantly, so every five minute chunk has one minute of pure review of stuff <i>you just saw ten minutes ago</i>, two minutes of new material intercut with one minute's worth of stuff that you have already seen, and thirty seconds of previews for things that you will see fifteen minutes from now.",1309864173

I'm pretty sure I have never had a positive experience with it.<p>The simplest thing is its packaging. The Amazon Appstore will run on anything - install the APK, and you're done. I've had a grand total of one app (Peggle) tell me that my device (CM7 Nook Color) was unsupported, and even then I could still manually install it from the My Apps list.<p>Compare that to the Market, which doesn't come in a nice little APK. Instead, if you're on an AOSP-based ROM, you have to install a separate gapps package through the freaking recovery menu. That is a huge pain in the ass. Then, there's the whole ""unsupported app"" crap. I don't care if you haven't tested your app specifically for my device, there's a fairly good chance it'll work perfectly fine. Having the Market restrict apps like that is quite irritating.<p>Then there's the installing. Somehow, even the simple act of installing an app doesn't work right. On multiple devices, running multiple ROMs (official and un), I have had the exact same problems: An app will, after pressing the install button, take forever to actually pop up in the notifications bar, and even then there's like a 20% chance the download will fail if you have more than one app download going at once. The worst thing the Appstore does when you're downloading more than one app is that the UI gets a tad laggy.<p>Also, Google's ""unique"" software license management. On both the iOS App Store and Amazon's, if I ""purchase"" a free app, it's mine forever. Period. Even if it goes to being a paid app. On the Market, if I purchase a free app and it goes paid, I basically get to keep the copy on my phone and that's all. If I go to another device or wipe my existing one, app goes bye-bye.<p>Google's awful management of the Market doesn't help, either. If you look outside the top fifty apps or so, it's all garbage- redundant soundboards, extremely poorly-coded games that wouldn't pass any sort of quality checks, that sort of thing. It's a little hard to look for good apps when there's so much complete crap.<p>Apologies for the rant... it's a bit late.",1309863722

Changes from the Previous Edition<p>The text is updated for the latest version, Perl 5.14, and some of the code only works with that version. We note in the text when we are talking about a Perl 5.14 feature, and we mark those code sections with a special use statement that ensures youre using the right version:<p><pre><code>  use 5.014; # this script requires Perl 5.14 or greater\n</code></pre>\nIf you dont see that use 5.014 in a code example (or a similar statement with a different version), it should work all the way back to Perl 5.8. To see which version of Perl you have, try the -v command-line switch:<p><pre><code>  $ perl -v\n</code></pre>\nHeres some of the new features from Perl 5.14 that we cover, and where appropriate, we still show you the old ways of doing the same thing:<p>* We include Unicode examples and features where appropriate. If you havent started playing with Unicode, we include a primer in Appendix C. You have to bite the bullet sometime, so it might as well be now. Youll see Unicode throughout the book, most notably in the chapters on Scalars (Chapter 2), Input/Output (Chapter 5), and Sorting (Chapter 14).<p>* There is more information in the regular expression chapters, covering the new features from Perl 5.14 to deal with Unicode case-folding. The regular expression operators have new /a, /u, and /l switches. We now cover matching by Unicode properties with the \p{} and \P{} regular expression features.<p>* Perl 5.14 adds a nondestructive substitution operator (Chapter 9), which turns out to be really handy.<p>* Smart matching and given-when has mutated a bit since their introduction in Perl 5.10, so we update Chapter 15 to cover the new rules.<p>* We updated and expanded Perl Modules (Chapter 11) to include the latest news, including the zero-conf cpanm tool. We add some more module examples as well.<p>* Some of the items previously in Appendix B, the advanced-but-not-demonstrated features, move into the main text.

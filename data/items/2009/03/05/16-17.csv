It is impractical as a technique at any other time because it is so easily defended.  This means that it would need to be developed as an additional skill.<p>2. It requires the coordination of both hands.  Proper shooting form requires only the use of one hand and the elbow is in line with the basket. Good shooters generally only miss on distance for this reason.<p>I think the takeaway from the article is that a free through is bound by players' psychology rather than athletic ability.  Other accuracy based solo-efforts also haven't shown improvement:<p><i>There are measures in other sports that have shown similar consistency, like golf scores or batting averages, but none of them are as straightforward as lobbing a ball toward a basket.</i>",1236272382

504421,comment,504328,504407,0,0,potatolicious,,,"Internet distribution is also a good way for studios to try out riskier ideas. The problem with the broadcast TV structure right now is that nobody dares put an aggressively creative show in a prime time slot - it's money on the table basically. So great new shows that may have attracted a solid fan base get thrown into suicide time slots, and inevitably fail.<p>With TV-on-demand (in all of its forms, not just the pay-per-episode format) you can do two things:<p>- Make risky shows just as accessible as the top blockbusters, giving them a real shot at success.<p>- Play with your price point. People may be willing to pay $2 an episode for Lost, but maybe they'll pay less for a more obscure show? Who knows, maybe you can charge <i>more</i>.<p>Up here in Canada Apple doesn't offer most of the shows that I follow, or I would be a regular customer...

504407,comment,504328,504370,0,0,Xichekolas,,,"Exactly. Where are my $2 episodes that I can download legally?<p>A decently popular cable show probably has around 2 million weekly viewers. Make it super easy to get the episodes in 720p for $2, and that is $4 million a week in revenue, or $80 million for a 20 episode season (plus merch and dvd collections afterwards). I'm not sure what a season of a given cable show costs to make, but I'd be surprised if it was $80 million.<p>From the consumer's perspective, we are used to paying $60-100/mo for cable. If episodes cost $2 and we watched four a month, that is $8 per show per month. Our normal $60-100 would buy us 7-12 shows, which I imagine is more than most people follow anyway.<p>Same could be true for sporting events. I'd gladly pay $4-5 to watch streaming high def games. The company would make a killing off me in March, but I'd still pay it because it's worth it to me to not have to buy a whole cable package just to watch one month of basketball.",1236270277

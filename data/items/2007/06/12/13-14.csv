He finally reveals that they represent eating your own dog food, i.e. a company using its own tools whether they're best for the job at hand or not.  Programmers whose productivity has been killed in this way are the mangled sheep, or marshmallows with ketchup.",1181656519

It evolved as a generic way to do some basic things: moving the executable to a place the user wants, and setting up some registry values. Isn't that a reasonable solution for desktop applications?<p>There is nothing wrong with the MSDN site. When you're storing millions of pages of documentation, things may get a little bloated. If you need to look up anything  about the Windows APIs, or any information about .NET languages, you'll quickly see that MSDN does the job well. <p><p>\n ",1181654440

My first couple tasks projects at my current employer were Swing apps, IDE plugins, etc.  <p>I was pulled onto web development because we basically can't sell desktop interfaces anymore.  I'd <i>prefer</i> to do desktop software, IMHO it's easier (particularly in Java, where the web frameworks suck), but there's just no demand for it.  Almost all new development at my employer uses a web front-end.  Almost all of our competitors are still using thick-client desktop apps.  When we go out to prospective clients and give demos, our web interface is a significant selling point.<p>'""web software"" is almost never considered valuable enough to get people to open their wallets for'<p>Our customers give us close to a million dollars a pop for our webapps.",1181654000

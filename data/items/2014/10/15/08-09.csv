(If you don&#x27;t happen to have your token around or work with it daily)<p>Right now to connect an API consumer, you have to:<p>1) Do the things on the consumer&#x27;s site until you&#x27;re prompted for the token<p>2) Open pinboard.in (presumely in a different tab)<p>3) Login to pinboard<p>4) Go to &quot;settings&quot;<p>5) Go to &quot;password&quot;<p>6) Copy API token<p>7) Switch back to consumer&#x27;s site<p>8) Paste token<p>Steps 4 and 5 might be more difficult than they look: If people didn&#x27;t use the token before or never had to change their password, they might not know how to get to settings > password. Or they might not know where to find the token at all.<p>I think you could make things a lot more convenient if API consumers could put a direct link to <a href=""https://pinboard.in/settings/password"" rel=""nofollow"">https://pinboard.in/settings/password</a> on their page. That way, the flow would look like this:<p>1) Do things on the API consumer&#x27;s site until you&#x27;re prompted for the token<p>2) Follow link to token page<p>3) Login to pinboard<p>4) Copy API token<p>5) Switch back to consumer&#x27;s site (or click &quot;back&quot; twice)<p>6) Paste token<p>7) Profit!<p>Right now, this almost works, except that if you&#x27;re not already logged into pinboard, the link will just take you back to the front page. So you&#x27;d have to change the login prompt so it remembered where you came from. That sounds like a pretty insignificant change, but I think it could make a difference.",1413363550

Another (sort of related) way of looking at it is that the closed interval has a maximum (or minimum) value, whereas the open interval, despite only missing a single value, suddenly has this feeling of continuation, because without that final value it now asymptotes to the end and you will always be able to find a larger (or smaller) value than any previous value you examine.",1413363435

8457633,comment,8457298,8457298,0,0,nikcub,,,"If you&#x27;re wondering how you should do these types of transactions without putting cash up front, the field is called trade finance.<p>Call your bank - most of them have a trade finance desk, or Google the term. A slightly cheaper way of doing it is to have a lawyer draft a terms of trade or supply agreement with either the funds in escrow with the firm or a bank guarantee.<p>Having your bank finance the trade is worthwhile as interest rates are so low at the moment. Common terms are 60, 90 or 120 day delivery with FED/LIBOR + x% (where x is the risk profile of your business - shop around to get prices) cost over the term.<p>The agreement would contain delivery timetables, warranties, customs clearance, liabilities, indemnities, guarantees, who pays what, etc. and you are protected legally without handing over tens of thousands of dollars or more upfront. These contracts are protected by law in almost all jurisdictions.<p>You don&#x27;t finalize the transaction and pay for it until all conditions have been met and you have the goods in hand and have verified. The seller is trusting an international bank or a law firm escrow, and they should also have a lawyer or bank on their end (a trusted seller can receive the cash upfront for a fee with the bank picking up the risk, although I doubt any bank would finance a bitcoin atm without verified trade volume and a lower risk profile).<p>Talk to your lawyer and talk to your bank, having expensive items delivered without risking the full cost is a solved problem as old as finance itself and trillions of dollars annually are traded in this way. The extra $1k or so you&#x27;d pay on a $25k deal are worth it for the guarantee. If you ship goods regularly the costs are amortized as you can use the same contracts and finance suppliers. Don&#x27;t deal with anybody shipping $20k+ valued products that doesn&#x27;t deal with a bank trade finance desk or law firm and is instead asking for a bank transfer.<p>This is how most high cost goods are traded - from oil and other commodity supply contracts through to companies like Boeing and Airbus supplying planes, or GE supplying turbines for a power plant. Most people without experience lead into it thinking that buying something that costs $25k, $100k or millions of dollars is just the same as purchasing something at your local store just with bigger numbers. It isn&#x27;t.<p>Bitcoin multisig transactions, or m of n transactions are also worth investigating as they cut the costs - although there is currently a lack of escrow/intermediaries who are as trusted as major law firms or an international bank. There is a huge opportunity in cutting the costs and fees associated with trade finance with bitcoin.",1413363038

8457628,comment,8456258,8457488,0,0,seanccox,,,"YC really has succeeded in building a recognized brand in the tech startup space, such that they can really define that space. I&#x27;d compare YC to Harvard or Davos (the World Economic Forum), where the challenge is to get accepted. Once you have passed the gateway, the wealthy/powerful recognize this by extending opportunities to new members.<p>This is true of almost any club (the Free Masons, your local BPOE, Boy Scouts, etc.). You join, you get to know people, those people help you with your interests, and in return you help them with their interests. It isn&#x27;t particularly difficult to see why this success might backfire and reduce/limit actual innovation, because it creates a powerful echo chamber – in part by design, to achieve specific goals, and in part by accident, because the people accepted by the club tend to meet predefined expectations.<p>The problem is, as I see it, that escaping that kind of feedback loop is very difficult, once an organization is in it, because the momentum making the loop bigger is difficult to redirect into an energy to make the loop different. Harvard could announce that it will no longer accept children from powerful/wealthy families, Davos could release a statement that this year it will be hosted in conjunction with the Communist International, and YC could relocate to Uganda for a season – but that&#x27;s not what these organizations do, so after a point, they aren&#x27;t able to innovate outside of very specific boundaries.<p>The answer to that, of course, is create new organizations with different boundaries/priorities, but Christ, that reeks of effort.",1413362895

In my life as a programmer, about 90% of my work was compiled, so I certainly have a bias. My personal perception was, that when working with compiled languages (mostly C++), I felt like building something. With interpreted languages (mostly Perl), I felt more like hacking something.",1211734680
199601,comment,199587,199587,0,0,pmjordan,,,"I don't know. All that effort, and I'm not even sure the quoted improvement is outside the error of measurement. The author doesn't specify the hardware here either, and the sustained rate of 15MB/s (peak: <35MB/s) seems to me like it's fairly old. His graphs are anything but convincing: need better data.<p>Really, the best thing you can do to improve your HDD performance is to:<p>1. Throw out ext3 and replace it with a better file system - consensus seems to be XFS if you have lots of large files, Reiser if you have lots of small ones or JFS for a nice blend. I personally have been using JFS for pretty much everything for a few years.<p>2. Buy a better hard disk. Good SATA disks are blazing fast these days. Get a Serial Attached SCSI RAID if the lack of speed is costing you money.",1211734242

Most of theses are NOT located in strip malls either. Many of these host servers for fortune 100's and governments as well as ordinary schmos like me. Some even have vaults like banks. I'm thinking the reporter just got dazzled by the <i>altogether ordinary</i> trappings of a datacenter that does co-lo simply because reporters don't usually visit many datacenters. I guess the man-traps and biometrics must have seemed pretty ""Star Trek"" to me the first time I went to a co-lo as well.<p>Completely unremarkable.

I've been rejected for jobs because I have a physics degree and not ""Comp. Sci""; I'm sure there are mathematicians on here who can say the same thing.<p>This might not be so true for startups, but I suspect that when faced with a deluge of applicants even startups will go straight for the ""Comp . Sci"" degrees if just to make the numbers managable.",1211732113

How about letting the OS do it, that's the whole point of an OS after all :)  Just nice down the distcc thing and let the OS do the rest.

199573,comment,199231,199231,0,0,aidanf,,,"Failure would rarely be ""catastrophic"" in the context of web search as described in the article. If the ML model makes an incorrect prediction on new data you have a bad search result. No big deal - just feed the new data back into the model and learn again.<p>If the data set is large enough then the ML model may find patterns that escape a human expert. When it comes to finding patterns in very large datasets machines scale much better than humans. Given a large enough dataset a ML approach should be less susceptible to the Black Swan phenomena than human experts.<p>On the other hand, if failure of the system really could be considered catastrophic then there could always be a human involved. In these cases output from ML models could be one of the inputs that the experts considers before coming to a final decision. E.g. you wouldn't want a ML model doing medical diagnosis by itself but it could be very useful for identifying patients that should be double-checked, scanning diagnosis for errors etc.",1211731620

Not something you'd do on the first day of incorporation, but hopefully after a year this amount of money shouldn't be a problem any more.

Do this by having a flexible curriculum so kids can study what's interesting to them.<p>Do mix age groups so that older kids can teach younger kids and thus learn the material better themselves, and younger kids can look up to the more successful older kids.  If age groups are mixed, then there's might be less room for thuggery.<p>Do teach that there are multiple answers by having more open-ended and creative assignments.<p>By the way, the elementary school I went to had a special one-month period one year called ""mini-course"" month or something like that, where everyone could choose one of the many offered mini courses and do just that every day.

It can be a paper todo list, a Google doc, a mindmap, or whatever else they chose to use. The key here is that <i>they don't forget their tasks, and they get them done</i> without babysitting on my part.<p>If they don't yet have such system but show promise, I may still hire them, but I'll make it clear that a personal GTD system is a <i>requirement</i>, so if they want to continue working for me, they'll have to develop such a system.

I'm still looking for appropriate wording, but here's a rough draft: The candidates <i>must</i> strive to understand <i>what</i> do I want them to do, i.e. what shape I want to bend reality into using their hands and minds.

He's got the ability to work the _full_ crowd, but he'll always have his eye on the audience members who have reserved the box seats .. the VIPs (i.e. shareholders).<p>By ensuring that shareholders are delighted, he makes sure that the show is lubricated with enough cash; so that they're able to ensure even more daring stunts and fireworks are available for the next season's performances.<p>I think it's wrong to assume that Apple are perfect.  In my opinion, there are many things that could be improved about their products, but Jobs realises that perception is _everything_ and he's worked hard to ensure that Apple's image is carefully crafted and actually fulfils emotional needs that Apple's customers have grown to appreciate - and would gravely miss if Apple wasn't around.<p>The amount of vitriol that's produced by Apple's advocates (when the parent company is attacked) consistently amazes me.<p>Watching the show from the cheap seats, I'm reminded how every business action can serve multiple aims.  Every (slightly or even, overtly) nefarious action can be teamed with a more egalitarian or idealistic aim; each of which can be used by advocates to fight Apple's corner.  It's supremely clever work.<p>I'm not sure if a corporation which operates such a cunning, clever operation should necessarily be congratulated every time they release results.

1806512,comment,1805839,1806129,0,0,wtallis,,,"I could easily see Apple wanting to buy or closely partner with AMD in a few years, if things go well for AMD. Certainly, their graphics business is going quite well these days, but the future of their CPU products is uncertain. If both their Bobcat and Bulldozer architectures are successful, then Apple might well be willing to risk alienating Intel. (Not that Intel has been showing any sign that they care if they alienate Apple.)<p>There would still be the problem that AMD always lags behind Intel in fab technology, which is why they have trouble going after the highest-performance and lowest-power segments. No matter how much cash you have on hand, there's no quick fix for that. At least with Intel CPUs, Apple products can generally match the performance of any competitor, and any price premium can be attributed to the better industrial design, integration, and software. If Apple switched to AMD processors, most of their computers would now be afflicted by a performance deficit in addition to the existing ""Apple tax"".<p>NVidia doesn't seem like a tantalizing acquisition for anybody except perhaps Intel, if they can admit that they don't know how to make a good GPU. NVidia has been mostly squeezed out of the chipset and integrated graphics markets by Intel's shady tactics and the awkwardness of AMD now owning ATI, and the discrete graphics war hasn't been going well for NVidia for quite some time, with no respite in sight. (This month, AMD will be releasing their third consecutive generation of GPUs that soundly beat the competition in price/performance comparisons at most price points. NVidia can't really do anything about it in the short term, because their chips are simply bigger for the same performance, so their profit margins are lower. They've been trying to mitigate this by focusing on HPC, but that's not catching on quickly enough, either.)",1287475601

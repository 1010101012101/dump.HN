5851607,comment,5851340,5851340,5,0,obstacle1,,,">Many claim the NSA is just another agency, and thus will share the same faults found in agencies like the IRS, which recently targeted people based on their political beliefs. This is a terribly wrong comparison. The IRS hires people with high-school diplomas, the NSA hires Ph.D.s with military service. If anybody at the NSA used their position to further their political party, their fellow employees would be the first to point that out, and stop them.<p>1. A PhD doesn&#x27;t imply lack of political prejudice. Military service doesn&#x27;t imply lack of political prejudice. High school as highest completed education doesn&#x27;t imply existence of political prejudice. This is an extremely ill-conceived argument and really only reveals the author&#x27;s own elitism.<p>2. The whistleblower in this case is a past employee of the CIA and current (well, I guess not anymore) contractor for the NSA. He did not even complete high school. The characterization of the NSA only hiring &quot;PhDs with military service&quot; is objectively wrong.<p>>The rank and file of the NSA is not your enemy. They carry out the mission that politicians give them, and do not cross the line with an almost religious fervor. Its the politicians who have moved that line.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_Trials"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_Trials</a>",1370825942

When I was in Middle and High School we used to take a road trip down to the Nevada Test site for the annual protests there.  My Friends Meeting used to hold actual civil disobedience training sessions.  One of the members of my Friends Meeting (Salt Lake Monthly Meeting) engaged in a similar protest (a lone trespass, though it did not involve cuttng through fences) and was acquitted by a jury.  I knew lots of people who decided to trespass during the protests, and many who chose not to.  When I was in Middle School I helped build rock barricades on the road into the test site, so I think I have a sense of what people think who engage in protests of this sort.<p>When someone in these communities decides to undertake a protest of this magnitude, particularly when it is against a military installation, they tend to expect the absolute worst.  This means inflated charges, possibly long prison terms, and so forth.  When someone decides to do it anyway, the typical approach is to try to use all of this to one&#x27;s advantage, to emphasize the political prisoner aspect, and to use the trial and jail time as a soap-box from which to make one&#x27;s view known.

After all, these are companies who have that information at their finger tips 24/7, who can invade all kinds of privacy without any oversight or checks and balances and nobody would even know to get outraged. The media companies, particularly Google, are companies that regularly collect and profile that information anyway for the expressed purpose of profiling people in order to maximize their ability to manipulate the public. As far as tech leaders are concerned, the NSA is the first party to suggest doing something non-evil or selfish with all that data.<p>So for things like listening to phone conversations, there&#x27;s still an argument and some outrage to be had.

But that shouldn&#x27;t stop anyone since you can just compile to JavaScript. Minifying Dart and compiling Dart to JavaScript is almost the same thing. In both cases it&#x27;s a single line which calls the compiler. If you already doing one of those things, adding the other one to your build script won&#x27;t hurt one bit.<p>You can also use the Dart executable like Node. You can use it to write command line applications or web servers.<p>You can also embed the VM into other applications. Like V8, the VM itself is just a library.<p>There will be also a Dart VM for ARM CPUs a bit later this year.<p>> <i>i would chose haxe instead of Dart , since it is compatible with some parts of javascript and one can use the DOM api directly</i><p>You can also interact with JS stuff if you use Dart. DOM stuff is done via &#x27;dart:html&#x27;, which provides a very idiomatic API. For example, all list-like things are actual Lists, which is very convenient. It&#x27;s similar to jQuery, I&#x27;d say.<p>> <i>Dart is great in theory but has little future.</i><p>It&#x27;s great in practice, too.

The problem with the &quot;conversation&quot; going on in these threads is that no one is defining that first.<p>If we&#x27;re talking about the first leaked version of PRISM, we still don&#x27;t even know if it exists or how it works. Subsequent revisions have made it seem that if the NSA doesn&#x27;t have the immediate ability to query the companies&#x27; backends, then they have some kind of carte blanche ability to ask for data and immediately receive it. If either of these are true, then certainly, where are the whistleblowers? If not, and there&#x27;s a very real chance that neither of these are true, then the question doesn&#x27;t make sense.<p>If instead we&#x27;re talking about FISA orders, there&#x27;s nothing <i>secret</i> to blow the whistle on. Everyone knew what they would allow. Congress was briefed on what they actually have allowed. The EFF has been in court for years (7 and 5 on different cases) to try to just figure out if their clients have standing to sue over FISA. Many of the companies on that PRISM list now have transparency reports that tell you exactly how they disclose data and provide numbers for requests (other than FISA, which you&#x27;re not allowed to do). There&#x27;s been tech blog coverage for years by sites like Ars Technica that discuss everything from the flawed ECPA to the attempts by the Obama administration to use national security as a guise to subvert all attempts to find out what these intelligence programs even do, let alone who they do them to. So, what did you expect them to blow a whistle on?<p>For instance, Google and Microsoft are both now reporting ranges of the NSLs they receive; in effect, a kind of whistleblowing, albeit a legal and vetted one. NSLs are very much like FISA orders, in that they contain gag orders and have minimal oversight (and no public oversight) for their approval. Where&#x27;s the indignation and action over those?<p>If we&#x27;re going for hindsight here, the real question is where the hell were the major news outlets and where the hell were the American people? Or why has Congress been willing to approve this program on <i>multiple occasions</i>? Assuming incompetence in all three of those groups, the usual response to those questions, is not an acceptable answer.<p>If instead we&#x27;re actually looking to the future, we need to ask how we&#x27;re going to hold the Obama administration and Congress&#x27;s feet to the fire to make sure that this ends, and that any real search beyond basic information (in a very narrow scope!) requires probable cause demonstrated before a judge, and that notification of a warrant can&#x27;t be gag-ordered and withheld indefinitely.",1370824428

My point was that the Verizon collection of data very clearly was for the entire customer base of their major subsidiary. Also this &#x27;metadata&#x27; has a staggering amount of information, like geocodes, dialed and received numbers, potentially content of SMS, downloaded apps, sites visited, etc. Further if this subsidiary controlled any Internet backbone (which I have no idea if that&#x27;s the case), the implications are huge.<p>Edward Snowden&#x27;s rationale for leaking this info is that people never realized that collection of metadata of phone records and PRISM and other programs had gone so far. Maybe SCOTUS ruled on some of this, but the public never realized the implications, largely because it&#x27;s all protected by top secret classification.<p>I used the Verizon story in my comment because those implicated in PRISM said in their carefully crafted PR messages that their warrants were for specific subjects and unlike Verizon&#x27;s vast dragnet. Anyhow, as other have pointed out, it&#x27;s not hard to draft a specific warrant for the narrow group of &#x27;every US user 13 years or older&#x27; which is what I&#x27;d presume PRISM involved. Also, the slides leaked for the PRISM stories showed that PRISM was the improvement on older collection techniques of essentially splicing Internet backbone cables.<p>Agreed on taking replies here with a grain of salt.",1370823450

By that I mean all these non violent protests occured at a time during violent protests. Martin Luther King Jnr was given negotiating power because the State preferred a non violent entity over the black panthers and other militaristic groups.<p>If there is no threat of repercussion, why would any entity bother negotiating with you?",1370822505

the company of Jehu as he came, and said, I see a company. And Joram
said, Take an horseman, and send to meet them, and let him say, Is it
peace?  9:18 So there went one on horseback to meet him, and said,
Thus saith the king, Is it peace? And Jehu said, What hast thou to do
with peace? turn thee behind me. And the watchman told, saying, The
messenger came to them, but he cometh not again.<p>9:19 Then he sent out a second on horseback, which came to them, and
said, Thus saith the king, Is it peace? And Jehu answered, What hast
thou to do with peace? turn thee behind me.<p>9:20 And the watchman told, saying, He came even unto them, and cometh
not again: and the driving is like the driving of Jehu the son of
Nimshi; for he driveth furiously.<p>9:21 And Joram said, Make ready. And his chariot was made ready. And
Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah went out, each in his
chariot, and they went out against Jehu, and met him in the portion of
Naboth the Jezreelite.<p>-----<p>God says...

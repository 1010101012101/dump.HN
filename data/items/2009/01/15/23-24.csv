What about chess?<p>A. Alexander Kronrod, a Russian AI researcher, said ``Chess is the Drosophila of AI.'' He was making an analogy with geneticists' use of that fruit fly to study inheritance. Playing chess requires certain intellectual mechanisms and not others. Chess programs now play at grandmaster level, but they do it with limited intellectual mechanisms compared to those used by a human chess player, substituting large amounts of computation for understanding. Once we understand these mechanisms better, we can build human-level chess programs that do far less computation than do present programs.<p>Unfortunately, the competitive and commercial aspects of making computers play chess have taken precedence over using chess as a scientific domain. It is as if the geneticists after 1910 had organized fruit fly races and concentrated their efforts on breeding fruit flies that could win these races.</i>",1232063432

Some people think much faster computers are required as well as new ideas. My own opinion is that the computers of 30 years ago were fast enough if only we knew how to program them. Of course, quite apart from the ambitions of AI researchers, computers will keep getting faster.<p>Q. What about parallel machines?<p>A. Machines with many processors are much faster than single processors can be. Parallelism itself presents no advantages, and parallel machines are somewhat awkward to program.

At work we often have to translate (or have translated) bid documents, contracts, documentation, training materials and software menus.  Further, my wife does contract work proof-reading translations.<p>Summary: Translating well is very, very hard. Most translations are poor.  Good translations are usually very expensive.<p>You will get what you pay for, with some margin of error.  If someone is cheap, I most strongly recommend you do some additional work getting the results checked.  Make sure you have a method of evaluating the translations.<p>We assess the quality required, then use professional translators in the appropriate prices range.  Poor translations will noticeably affect your users' perceptions of your product.<p>And no, I don't think there is a happy meduim you've missed.  I would also advise you to be careful using the Mechanical Turk without an independent method of assessing the result.<p>Sorry to be so negative, but we've had some bad experiences through over-optimism.  Learn caution from our mistakes.",1232060609

This type of processing typically needs input data provided by a computer vision system, acting as a vision sensor and providing high-level information about the environment and the robot. Other parts which sometimes are described as belonging to artificial intelligence and which are used in relation to computer vision is pattern recognition and learning techniques. As a consequence, computer vision is sometimes seen as a part of the artificial intelligence field or the computer science field in general.</i>",1232060442

It could still be improved though.<p>I like the ""Perfectly Safe, Perfectly Simple, Perfectly Free"", but stylistically it's quite different from the infographic on top.

They can, as you say, deliver content only on these broken devices, leading more people to give up their software freedom in exchange for more convenient access to TV or tunes.<p>It doesn't stop there, though.   Some software vendors <i>also</i> like these restrictions.   With treacherous computing, vendors can make themselves the exclusive providers of software and enjoy monopolistic pricing.  In contrast, consider that the cost of a complete operating system for a non-broken computer starts with many decent options at a price of $0.<p>Treacherous computing also makes it easier for software vendors to monitor their users in ways that users can't control and might not even notice.   There is no way, for example, to tell some devices not to ""call home"" and betray a users privacy to their vendors.<p>So it's a convergence of reasons, not just the ""entertainment industry"" (I guess you mean a few big companies, not everyone who sells entertainment) behind the thing.",1318960357

The cheapest model there is $349.  I just bought a 15"" Acer laptop for a client (in a pinch) for the exact same price.  Obviously, the specs destroy the Chromebook, and that price also includes the Windows 7 license (which isn't really free).  If it's portability and mobility you want, then you're approaching the price of an iPad, with some of those Chromebooks at ~$500.<p>I could be out to lunch, but I think that price is a mistake, a mistake that's been repeated by players in this space: you can't sell an iPad competitor that's worse than the iPad for the same price.  It seems basic, but no one has figured that out yet.<p>There's also the fact that the idea of running on Chrome (web only) is cool, but not for the mainstream yet.

It is a common misconception that Haskell has ""problems"" with external state, when in fact what it has a way of explicitly managing such state where almost any other language does not. It isn't so much that Haskell is lacking the ability to manage external state as that <i>other</i> languages lack the ability to manage external state, and end up with a solution that from the Haskell point of view looks like a punt rather than a great solution.<p>But it's difficult to explain how that works in an HN comment; I'd suggest Learn You a Haskell up through the Monad chapter, then spending some time with STM until you grok how and why the type system actually manages to guarantee proper use of STM at compile time. This is interesting because STM has proved effectively intractable in languages that can't maintain the STM constraints at the type level. While the course I've just recommended may take a week of education, that's about all it would take; it's not months, and it's actually a very valuable perspective to gain on the problem of creating quality code I'd recommend to anyone.",1318958211

Of this could just be a generic communication tool with employees who may not have regular access to email (things like trades, etc.)<p>TL;DR: I think it's a cool tool, but teacher/student communication may be a little risky to start with.<p>EDIT: You do deserve a huge credit for developing a tool that helps teachers, rather than attempts to remove them from the process. I've seen too many tools developed as ""teaching aids"" that seem to be rooted in the belief that teachers are somehow lacking and that a massed produced video game or application could replace them. These ultimately assume that the teachers are lazy or ignorant and would hand their students over to an outsider; which is why they never succeed.

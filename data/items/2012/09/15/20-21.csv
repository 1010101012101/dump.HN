They sell to giant organizations, not to the public.<p>Most of what you know about Trapwire probably comes via Stratfor thirdhand via Wikileaks by way of Reddit. Think about that again: your information started at <i>Stratfor</i>. It was then spun by <i>Wikileaks</i>. And then it was analyzed by <i>Reddit</i>. And you trust it more than the NYT.<p>And all the while, Trapwire had a <i>web page</i> describing all this stuff.<p>One reason why the NYT and WaPo and WSJ and Al Jazeera are so much better than Reddit at conveying the news is that they have something to lose when they get the story wrong. All of them trade on reputations that took decades to build. You can literally feel this in action as you race to start typing about how the NYT got Iraq wrong. Notice how you can't say that about any story on Reddit, because it's a howling mob of random people?<p>(FWIW: There are great comments on Reddit; their highs are higher than HN's highs, by a lot.)",1347742775

By the way I wrote the XCB-OpenGL doc that is cited in this article.<p>You <i>can</i> use XCB with OpenGL, but you won't be getting rid of Xlib altogether because of GLX depends on Xlib. It does not mean that you cannot use XCB or get any advantage out of it.<p>So you use Xlib+GLX for OpenGL initialization and XCB for events and windowing stuff. Works like a charm.<p>> It means that they're forcing us to install and use XCB that doesn't support Hardware Accelerated Graphics using your ATI/NVIDIA binary drivers. And it ends up reverting back and using XLIB/GLX anyways.<p>""Forcing us to install"" is a rather awkward choice of words since you most likely do have XCB installed and the version of Xlib you have is built with XCB.<p>And the XCB+GLX+Xlib hybrid setup that is detailed in the XCB wiki article works just fine with Nvidia (and presumably ATI) drivers, with hardware acceleration.",1347742628

Yes, Samsung manufactures Apple's chips, but the chip is designed by Apple using IP licensed from ARM, Imagination Technologies and others, but as far as Samsung is concerned the chip is a black box.<p>- Samsung has given technology to Apple before they used it themselves several times in the past.<p>I also doubt the first part of your statement.

I always hated Facebook's app because it wreaked of shoddiness and flaunted it's lack of thoughtful development.<p>I can't help but feel that they went and hired a bunch of brilliant programmers that had zero experience developing for the web. Developing a front-end web app can be (and often is) a horrifying thing to any developer, because the environment is so volatile (and really, unlike any other development environment).<p>I'm extremely disappointed in Facebook because had they done things right, it could have been an awesome thing.

Consider the following code:<p><pre><code>  NSString *string = [NSArray arrayWithObject:@1];\n  [string isKindOfClass:NSArray.class]; // Returns true\n</code></pre>\nWhich compiles and runs just as you would expect the equivalent Ruby code to:<p><pre><code>  string = [ 1 ]\n  string.kind_of?(Array) # Returns true\n</code></pre>\nI would even argue that Cocoa (Touch) shares many similarities to Rails.

X-Windows partisans did not cease to extol its supposed strengths over Microsoft Windows and the Macintosh.<p>They said that the separation of mechanism and policy would make inevitable any number of advances in user interfaces that were not possible under closed source models.  Look at what actually happened.  The overwhelming majority of Linux window systems and desktop environments were Windows 95 work-alikes, NeXTstep work-alikes, or attempts at minimalism based on BlackBox or aewm.  Enlightenment was the only major exception, but it went by the wayside due to Rasterman's falling out with RedHat and by that project's attempt to build resources that were not but should have been included in X-Windows.<p>In the meantime, Microsoft kept improving Windows until, with XP, they had an operating system that even many Slashdotters were forced to admit was usable and productive.  In the meantime, Apple went to the brink of ruin and bounced back to usability preeminence using Unix code, but violating -- nay, <i>extravagantly</i> violating -- the Unix philosophy when it comes to user interfaces.<p>""The year of Linux on the desktop"" has long since become a bad joke even among the Slashdot set precisely <i>because</i> they held to their principles.

I've constructed the requested response such that it can't be a response from any of the programs on the list.  It's like the Cantor diagonalization argument.<p><i>Since it is also an assumption to take for granted that even though the possible programs is countable it is a practically enumerable finity.</i><p>Not really.  If I take the mapping to be the trivial one -- any number maps to the program the binary representation of that number would be in machine code -- then getting a runnable program from a number in input is pretty trivial.

Combine that with a greater reliance on ISA optimized assembly than today, and you can see why their customers started to leave.<p>If Apple did roll their own ARM this time around, they almost certainly built prototypes of the iPhone 5 with a ""standard"" ARM9 design for contingency reasons. Getting the software to work on either hardware should have only been a matter of setting some optimization flags and swapping out a few header files.

Haskell has an edge in its rich libraries and aggressive optimisation. Through laziness, top-level parallelism can be specied in a more modular way, minimising the need to modify components and avoiding any notion of explicit threads. Thus, Haskell is the language of choice for minimally intrusive parallelism. F# and Scala provide several mechanisms for parallelisation, some as high level as Haskells, some lower level with more potential for performance tuning. Thus, these languages provide a more direct route to controlling low level aspects and can use object-oriented and impure language features.""<p>It would be cool to see a similar contrast between Data Parallel Haskell (<a href=""http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/GHC/Data_Parallel_Haskell"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/GHC/Data_Parallel_Haskell</a> / <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWSZ4c9yqW8"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWSZ4c9yqW8</a>) and others.",1347739569

X was created at a time when computers had 1/50,000th the power they do today by inverse Moore's law reasoning 2^(25/1.5). From a graphics performance perspective its probably closer to one five-millionth the equivalent power by the reasoning that a full frame (1920 x 1080) specularly lit frame can be rendered in 16 mS today vs 86400000 mS 25 years ago.

Union thugs will destroy  --DESTROY-- your exhibit if you don't play by union rules.  They will run stuff over with forklifts.  Drop boxes with electronics and cause damage.  They'll cut-off your power.  And the list goes on.  So, you have to learn to work within the system and enjoy the shafting.<p>For those claiming that ""socialist Europe"" is fine and they are highly unionized.  Well, I've done trade-shows in Europe as well.  Night and day when compared to the US., particularly if you compare to union-heavy towns like NYC and Chicago.  Exhibiting in London, Munich or Amsterdam (all of which I have personally done) is a dream compared to what you can go through in NYC.  For lack of a better description, there's a sense of having a common mission: having a successful show for all involved.  In addition to that, I found exhibit hall workers in Europe to be far more polite, willing and able to help than their American counterparts.  And, above all, I have never, EVER, seen exhibit hall workers sleeping on the job in Europe whereas I have seen that many times in the US (quite literally dropping to the floor in the middle of a booth to take a nap).<p>It's interesting how people voice all kinds of opinions until they actually experience reality.  As you say, now that you are an entrepreneur and you've seen, first-hand, how fucked-up things are your opinion of trade-shows has changed.<p>I tend to agree with you with regards to ROI.  I have personally spent upwards of $150,000 per exhibit about twice a year for a few years.  In certain industries it's an arms-race of sorts.  This was certainly true before consumers learned that the Internet could provide a very good buying experience.  For a while, if you did not exhibit at key shows you didn't exist or potential customers would question the quality, size or viability of your business.  Little did they know that the money burned at trade-shows would be far better utilized in product development.  The ROI on these shows sometimes takes years to produce.  I had one particularly interesting case with an Italian customer.  I'd must have seen him at six trade-shows over three years before he bought anything from me.  When he finally became a customer I asked him why it took so long to choose our products.  He simple said that he needed to make sure we'd be around before making a commitment.  How do you calculate the ROI on that.<p>But, I agree, today, trade-shows can be hard to justify.  I have not done one in three or four years and love it.  I have product that sells over the Internet with zero dollars dedicated to marketing through any medium (other than simply having a good website).",1347739210

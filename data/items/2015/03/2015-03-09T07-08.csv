9169763,comment,9166501,9167809,0,0,mikekchar,,,"Although I read the answer from the OP, reading the original message made me think of something slightly different.  The debate is almost impossible to characterize because nobody is arguing apples to apples.  When we talk about incompetence, almost nobody will agree to its meaning.<p>Thanks to the Dunning Kruger effect, people who are incompetent do not realize they are incompetent.  I remember reading a follow-up paper to this study (I wish I could find it again!) which concluded that when people have their mistaken beliefs pointed out to them, it actually reinforces that mistaken belief!  This means that when people actually engage in debate, the two sides entrench and become more confident in their positions.<p>I have actually argued that this may be what leads large corporations to have a kind of &quot;talent inversion&quot;.  The people with the least talent have the most confidence and volunteer for the craziest projects.  The projects fail, but due to politics the failure is hidden and spun into a success.  The original developers begin to believe their failure was a real success and any debate to the contrary only strengthens their belief -- which fuels their confidence.  This confidence allows them to be promoted where the cycle continues and multiplies.<p>This leaves you with a strange situation.  Everyone will agree that incompetence is a big problem in the organization.  Unfortunately, everyone will point to completely different people when asked who is incompetent.<p>Let&#x27;s say that you want to improve the level of talent on the team.  In other words, you want to hire only people who are more talented than the average person already on your team.  I think this is not an unusual situation to be in.  If talent is normally distributed on the team then half of the team is below average (I hope I got that right because I suck at statistics ;-) ).  But thanks to &quot;talent inversion&quot;, you may have a higher proportion of people in senior ranks that are in the &quot;below average&quot; section.<p>Now you can have a debate about the what kind of people to hire:  If person A thinks that they are at the top of the talent scale, they can&#x27;t expect candidates to be as talented as they are.  Probably they think it is completely reasonable to hire people who are considerably less talented than they are.  Person B may <i>actually</i> be at the top of the talent scale and may be arguing strenuously that candidates must be considerably more talented than Person A.<p>Clearly such a debate will have a lot of heat without a lot of light.",1425887556

9169750,comment,9167147,9169727,0,0,meric,,,"Dude. From the article:<p><i>I had a boss once who knew he was sexist (also homophobic and transphobic), but was trying to get over it. He said some incredibly dumb things, like offering to have a company meeting at a strip club. He genuinely had bizarre concepts of what’s appropriate and inappropriate behavior. He was ashamed of this and really trying to improve. Listening to him quote the sexual harassment seminars was the saddest bit: on one hand he was really trying, but on the other, everything he was quoting made absolutely no sense. I frequently found him putting so much effort in where it didn’t really matter, like obsessively counting how many times he had asked a man vs a woman to carry heavy equipment. He always seemed overloaded with things to remember about “not being sexist” and afraid to get something wrong. It seemed almost heartless to risk getting him in trouble.<p>On the whole, however, I don’t hold against him all the inappropriate things he did. The best I could do was kindly remind my boss when something made me uncomfortable, but he always looked panicked when I did. I didn’t want to get him in trouble; in fact, half of my comments to him started with phrases like “you know people are going to take it the wrong way if they hear you saying that.” I wish my male peers had helped him more in this regard. I feel they could have done it without making my boss feel like he was being directly threatened with a huge HR complaint. It’s a real shame for our tech culture that there is no way to get somebody tutored about what is and isn’t appropriate without also landing them in deep trouble.</i><p>And yes I think with a larger family you&#x27;re less likely to have men thinking its OK to corner a woman in office, because they&#x27;ll have better upbringing. If you want to change culture the best chance you have is the educate your children because of all people they will be most receptive of your perspective.<p>Thanks for the snark anyway, I deserved it because I see family as a good thing to have, and as such I&#x27;m a rapist.

Compare that adverse and permanent damage that sugar can cause to damage that for example LSD was proven to cause (none).

Your body can maintain about 1 lb of glycogen and 3 lb of water associated with that glycogen. Not eating carbs will likely lead to a big decrease in this weight.

The comments here reflect my attempt to reconcile the fact that that&#x27;s obviously not something we can count on.  But in terms of the big picture I agree that &quot;awareness&quot; is an important hurdle.<p>So the reasoning goes:  It appears there needs to be some mechanism in place to hold people accountable for their actions.  Not that we don&#x27;t want the overarching goal to teach people how to respect others, but that&#x27;s a life lesson, and not necessarily something that you can put a definitive timeline on in terms of when you&#x27;re going to achieve your goal.<p>I think a real-world solution needs to recognize that you can&#x27;t guarantee that all employees will understand or follow your guidelines for how to behave in the workplace.  So it follows that part of the plan needs to incorporate accountability.  It&#x27;s far more difficult to hold someone accountable when all you have is hearsay.  With 3rd party testimony, however, a company is going to have more data to use when trying to figure out / arbitrate a dispute or investigate a claim of harassment.<p>So, in principle I like the idea that people have mentioned where everyone should be responsible for everyone else.  In theory this looks like it&#x27;s a great idea, but in practice if this is your only rule / policy, it makes it very difficult for people to gauge whether progress is being made, or if they&#x27;ll ever accomplish their goal.  When you have a specific responsibility I find it&#x27;s going to be far easier for the person to comprehend and observe whether or not they&#x27;re accomplishing or are on the path to accomplish their objectives of keeping the workplace safe for everyone.<p>Imagine if one day Larry Page sends out a memo to all Google employees, and says that he&#x27;s decided to change how they operate.  From today forward, &quot;There are no longer specific jobs or goals.  Instead we&#x27;re all just going to concentrate on our one overarching goal.  All employees are now in charge of making sure the company makes money&quot;.  And that&#x27;s the only direction that is given.  It&#x27;s one big overarching goal and everyone just needs to make sure that happens.  No specific tasks are laid out for any one individual in order to make that happen.  Now consider this scenario in contrast to the world at Google today where I imagine everyone, though in spirit are all working toward the single overarching goal of the company, each &quot;cog in the wheel&quot; has their own specific responsibilities to make that happen.",1425886231

Private investors routinely make bad investments.

In central London you would hope for highly compacted sand at about 50m (150&#x27;) deep. Above this is London clay and a whole lot of river basin sediment. London&#x27;s tall buildings are either founded on the sand with very long piles which are tricky to construct as they are subjected to groundwater at high pressure. The base of the pile is further under water than a WW2 submarine would typically operate so it&#x27;s difficult to prevent the pile from collapsing while inserting concrete at the bottom. Or they rely on the stickiness of the clay layer by using large diameter (up to 2.5m/8&#x27;) piles that rely on a large amount of surface area in contact with the clay. Next time you look at one of the funny shaped buildings on London&#x27;s horizon, think that it could be a little bit like a 100,000 tonne water boatman insect :-)",1425884953

Hence it&#x27;s terribly upsetting to hear a colleague repeatedly does worse.<p>But if the definition of mugged was that someone&#x27;s colleague repeatedly left them with $500 bar tabs that they felt compelled to pay, then we might say, yeah, I see the issue.

Because deciding overnight that the kid should stop calling that guy daddy is not really something we want to be simple like fetching a baguette. Since it&#x27;s a medical procedure, they used the medical law to limit that. A family matters judge has to be involved, and the outcome has to have a purpose. In this example the &quot;father&quot; was very distant and not really involved in raising the little girl and the couple was splitting, so the question of paying child support was raised. I guess the lack of a fatherly bond and the lack of genetic link made the judge decide against the child support and allowed the father to be removed from the child birth certificate (but it&#x27;s a soft limit, the judge has to make a difficult call for the definition of father).",1425884668

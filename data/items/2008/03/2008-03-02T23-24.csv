127661,comment,127593,127638,0,0,yummyfajitas,,,"Another thing to consider: in the US (assuming you plan to market in the US), 2/3 presidential candidates have proposed variants of socialized health care. The ""conservative"" candidate is a ""maverick"", who is not averse to doing similar things.<p>This doesn't bode well for long term planning. In 4-5 years time, who will the buyers be? Doctors, hospitals, or some American version of NHS? What regulations will you need to satisfy?<p>If the healthcare system is taken over (in any sense) by the government, expect major rent seeking from various special interest groups. M$ may purchase a ""M$ software only"" law, or hospital administrators may purchase a ""don't let software steal our jobs"" law. (Such laws will, of course, go by such names as ""Helping Children not Die of Cancer Act"").<p>In short, I'm saying that unless you are a lobbyist, stay away from this market for a few years. Do your real estate thing, come back to healthcare once the market settles down.",1204501541

It does wonders. My biggest regret right now is that I'm not doing Judo or Brazillian Jiu-Jutsu regularly anymore.

Its been on Reddit many, many times also, for the same reason. There is nothing wrong with that, its an unavoidable characteristic of systems like this (unless you particularly wanted to make an effort to avoid dupes).<p>Though I agree it could be waaay better executed by someone with enough time and data on their hands. The first time I saw it I really wanted to abstract the idea to a general system into which you simply feed structured historical data, and people can generate custom interactive map-reports. Wonder if there is much of a market for such a thing, it'd be really cool for educational purposes.",1204499996

They prefer large vendors like Microsoft and Philips over smaller agile startups. Our users (Doctors, Nurses, Pharmacists) are not our customers (Bean Counters, Management) and that makes getting good products that can help hard to get into the users hands.<p>But the possibilities for improvement are huge and you will make a real difference to the lives of people which makes getting your product adopted so much of a sweeter victory.<p>My advice is do what makes you happy, and if possible improves the world in some way.",1204499079

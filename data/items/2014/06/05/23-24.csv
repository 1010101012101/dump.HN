And &quot;its different&quot; isn&#x27;t good enough. Certain things in your UI should be obvious, intuitive, easy to find. You shouldn&#x27;t have to go look them up in Google. IF you are going to change things so drastically, then do something to teach the user (or do you think they will read your mind?) You shouldn&#x27;t be forcing your user to use Google to figure out how to use your UI, for simple things.<p>I realize Microsoft wanted to make closing apps more difficult, but the third item on the list is &quot;how to find programs&quot; You&#x27;ve done something horribly wrong if you have THIS many people asking that question.",1402012763

A big factor that helped students from affluent homes is the fact that their college-graduate parents were familiar with college campus services and how to navigate them. So when their children failed tests and called home upset they would tell them to go to a tutoring center, or encourage them to go to office hours and ask for help. Students from poor homes, with parents that never went to college, didn&#x27;t understand the resources available to them and were more likely to drop out because of that. If anyone can find a link to the article, it would be appreciated.",1402012653

In fact, men are overwhelmingly more likely to fall victim to violent crime, including violent crime from strangers.<p>I googled &quot;statistics women safety&quot; and wasn&#x27;t able to find anything that pointed to any sort of conclusive study as to where or when a woman should feel unsafe. All I found was page after page of statistics on sexual assaults, rapes, and domestic violence that all seemed to paint the opposite picture of these mysterious statistics that you have been bringing up. For example:<p>* 12.4% of women had been sexually abused before the age of 15, compared with <i>4.5%</i> of men, between 1996 and 2005. (Australia) [1]<p>* Of men who reported that they had experienced physical violence in the 12 months before the survey, 73.7% said that the perpetrator was a male (Australia) [1]<p>* One in 6 women and <i>1 in 33</i> men have experienced an attempted or completed rape (USA) [2]<p>* 1 in 12 women and <i>1 in 45</i> men have been stalked in their lifetime (USA) [2]<p>* 81% of women stalked by a current or former intimate partner are also physically assaulted by \nthat partner; 31% are also sexually assaulted by that partner (USA) [2]<p>I could go on, and on, and on. I wasn&#x27;t able to find any of these mystery statistics that you&#x27;ve been citing to prove your points, though. They all seem to show that it&#x27;s probably a decent idea for women to listen to their intuition about a guy they find creepy, even if they are not statistically unsafe.<p>---<p>> If far more men than women were graduating from college; if men universally received far lighter prison sentences than women for the same crimes; if young men were earning more than young women; if women had zero reproductive rights beyond &quot;don&#x27;t have sex with a fertile man&quot;; if women were overwhelmingly more likely to fall victim to violent crime, including (but not limited to) murder; then would you not make a public, loud, brave scene about how unfair life is for women?<p>This obsession with a perceived unfairness between the genders is starting to get creepy. What man has zero reproductive rights? If you don&#x27;t want to have a kid and aren&#x27;t sure if she&#x27;s on birth control, use a condom for fuck&#x27;s sake. It&#x27;s not rocket science.<p>The study that showed young women earn more than men also showed that women in the same industry with the same degree level earned less than male counterparts, and that their wages tended to stagnate or fall after having kids.[3] It is assumed in the study to be related to the fact that a significantly higher percentage of young women hold college degrees.[3] If it bothers you this much that women with degrees earn more than men without degrees, maybe western society isn&#x27;t the best choice for you. There are plenty of countries where women aren&#x27;t even allowed to go to college. I&#x27;m sure you could earn more there as an uneducated man than most women.<p>While it&#x27;s true that a majority of murders are perpetrated against men, an even larger majority of murders are perpetrated <i>by</i> men! The FBI&#x27;s latest data on murders in the US shows that 22% of murder victims are female, while <i>only 7%</i> of those that commit murder are female. It&#x27;s clear from those numbers alone that a male murdering a female is <i>at least</i> twice as likely as a female murdering a female. Had enough yet? How about this: of the 594 cases of murder where a spouse killed their opposite gender-ed partner in 2012 in the US, 84% (496) of the time the victim was the wife, not the husband.[4]<p>None of your complaints regarding the hardships of males due to females have ANY MERIT IN REALITY. If you&#x27;re going to pontificate about facts and statistics, at least cite the facts and statistics that you&#x27;re claiming to be the basis of your opinion.

He just has all his memories from the original timeline (e.g. previous X-Men and Wolverine films), plus the events he experienced during Days of Future Past. He has no memory of what happened to him between 1973 and the present in the new timeline (which he created). That&#x27;s why he&#x27;s surprised to see a few characters at the end of DoFP. He remembers them from the original timeline, but he also remembers them dying in the original timeline. What would be much stranger is if they had never met him in the new timelines (in which case he would remember them but they wouldn&#x27;t know him), or if he had met someone in the new timeline but not the original timeline (in which case they would know him but he would have no memory of them).",1402009228

They did this primarily so they would only have to offer expensive plans. Grandma can&#x27;t get the 300meg email plan for $8, only the $80 plan. And then everybody tried to use it like it really was unlimited.<p>2) DRM. Drm makes it so that the net can&#x27;t cache. 90% of netfilx bandwidth is likely the same 10% of videos. They all have to make the full trip through the wires. A local cache at the ISP to improve efficiency is impossible.",1402009227

The article says they skipped &quot;one of the final interviews&quot; suggesting there were multiple already...  And within one interview I can assess the skill level of the people interviewing me without having to attempt to intuit it based on how many of the &quot;Microsoft questions&quot; from the 80s they found on Google to ask potential candidates.<p>Are you sure the candidate was &quot;spooked&quot; because you didn&#x27;t interview him or her that one final time?  The article doesn&#x27;t do a good job of explaining if that is speculation or verified feedback from the candidate.

6501417,story,,,2,2,csdrane,"Ask HN: Switching from finance to tech?",,"I work in finance in a nontechnical role. Since I graduated from college six years ago, I have felt like I am on the wrong career path. I really feel like I need to switch industries. My job is very demanding. My heart isn&#x27;t in my work and I feel like I&#x27;m underperforming as a result. I&#x27;ve also had a difficult time dealing with the stress of the job and the work culture.<p>One of my big regrets is that I never took much math in college. But I am a very independent person--a self-learner with a hacker&#x27;s mindset, and I try to fill in the gaps where I need to. I self-taught Python and enjoy working on personal coding projects. My idea of a good time is reading Gilbert Strang&#x27;s Introduction to Linear Algebra, Concrete Mathematics, etc.<p>In my spare time I&#x27;ve been taking the Coursera and EdX courses on machine learning. I&#x27;ve found this to be fascinating and it&#x27;s got me pondering data science as a potential career.<p>General Assembly in NYC offers an 11-week Data Science program. Students pick a research project and then present their projects at GA-hosted employer meet and greets after the course ends. The vast majority of students already have a technical background, although there also are some people in fields such as finance looking to make a career change. Admission is selective though, and there&#x27;s no guarantee that I&#x27;d even be accepted, let alone have traction with the job hunt that follows.<p>I feel very lost. I&#x27;ve been referred to a career psychologist (seriously.) by someone I trust and respect, so we&#x27;ll see how that goes.<p>Going back to school is always an option, but I don&#x27;t know what I would study. I suppose I could do an MS in Comp Sci or an MBA but I&#x27;m not sure either would be a good fit. The former, perhaps not being career oriented enough; the latter, I&#x27;m not interested in the types of doors it might open and I feel burnt out from business in general.<p>And so I turn to you, HN.",1380995612

They just wouldn&#x27;t be forced to work full time, instead opting to only work as many hours as is necessary to meet their disposable income needs.<p>On the other hand, I&#x27;m wondering what a minimum livable wage does pricewise and scarcity-wise for all goods and services that those on a minimum livable wage earn. There would probably be an upwards inflationary effect on the prices of those goods, countered by economies of scale. This would apply to pretty much all basic expenses except housing, which would largely only go up because you can&#x27;t make more land in desirable places.<p>If there is a minimum livable wage, I would still imagine that opting to only use it and no other income would still force you to leave city centers where rent is too high to afford.

Hence &quot;boring, low paid work&quot; becomes just &quot;boring work&quot;.<p>Next, let&#x27;s further assume that &quot;boring work&quot; describes the type of work that people do not normally want to do.<p>And here&#x27;s the though experiment: What if the converse of &quot;boring work&quot; (e.g., &quot;interesting work&quot;) was not actually &quot;work&quot;?<p>That is, what if &quot;interesting work&quot; was not compensated?  What if people were not paid for doing what they are naturally inclined to do, i.e., for doing what they love?<p>What if we only compensated people for doing &quot;boring work&quot;?<p>Remarkably, this actually does not sound too far from reality.  Because that is exactly what many people do in order to be compensated: boring work.  Similarly, many of us do plenty of &quot;work&quot; for which we are not compensated.<p>What&#x27;s different about the thought experiment is that we reassess whether persons who refuse to do boring work in favor of interesting work should actually be paid.  After all, they are doing what they love.  And they would presumably do this regardless of payment.<p>If only the &quot;grunt workers&quot; get paid, then we have created an incentive to do grunt work.  We have not removed the incentive to do more interesting, &quot;higher level&quot; work because that incentive does not find its basis in compensation, for this is the &quot;work&quot; that people actually want to do, regardless of payment.

If I feel I can&#x27;t trust EC2, or that it is too expensive, I can purchase my own hardware and move my stack to that.

The price of something is instead based exclusively on willingness to pay for it.<p>There is a lot of misconception surrounding this principle.<p>To oversimplify, in the short term, price is determined by the interactions of supply and willingness to pay.<p>However, in the long term (in a competitive market), new suppliers will enter the market if existing suppliers are making supernormal profits, and existing suppliers will exit if they are making subnormal profits.<p>This means that, in the long run, price will converge to the average total cost of production, in a competitive market.<p>Of course, Netflix is not operating in a perfectly competitive market, but that distorts the price in a different way. It&#x27;s not quite technically correct to say that price is based exclusively on willingness to pay for it; even in noncompetitive markets (true monopolies, as opposed to monopolistic competition), one can just as easily say that price is determined by the quantity that the monopolist wishes to sell.",1380994465

By giving essentially free rent to those who cannot afford current market rate rents, it relieves political pressure to reform housing policies that keep rental rates high while also inflating rents and property values, heavily distorting the rental market. I think one can easily view the Section 8 program more as welfare program benefiting property owners rather than lower class renters.<p>A basic income would have a similar effect on the general cost of living, inflating values and benefiting the wealthy.

That is great if your proof checker is reliable, and <i>catastrophic</i> if it is unreliable.  Fortunately, proof checkers need not be complicated; you only need a small kernel, from which you can build the rest of the theory.<p>The other issue is usability.  Coq is awesome, but proving something more complicated than basic arithmetic results is <i>hard</i> to do.  Likewise with ACL2, PVS, and similar systems.  It is getting better, but we are still not quite there.",1380992635

The grain of truth that makes your comment sound plausible is that bad programmers generate <i>more</i> integer overflows.

5760360,comment,5755852,5760082,4,0,tmhedberg,,,"> Do those you mention handle content type and encodings correctly?<p>I honestly can't say for sure, but I've never encountered such a problem in my own usage. Maybe that just means I've been lucky. I just know from firsthand experience that they do a lot of things better than the HTTP package does.<p>> The main problem is the need to use ""toValue"" and ""toHtml"" all the time. I guess I don't understand why the element building functions don't accept strings.<p>First of all, if you're writing string literals and explicitly converting them with `toHtml`, you're missing out. Instead, enable the OverloadedStrings extension, and then you can do this sort of thing:<p><pre><code>    html $ do
      head $ title ""My Web Page""
      body $ do
        h1 ""A Heading""
        h2 ""A Subheading""
        hr
        p ""A paragraph of text""
        p $ ""Another paragraph, with an "" <> (a ! href ""http://example.com/"") ""embedded link""
        p $ em ""Emphasized text"" <> "" and "" <> strong ""strongly emphasized text""
</code></pre>
Notice the total lack of `toHtml` there.<p>The HTML DSL functions don't accept strings because String and Html are two fundamentally different types of data. Enabling the type system to differentiate between the two lets you do some pretty nifty things. For instance, if you were to write<p><pre><code>    ""<script>alert('XSS!');</script>"" :: String
</code></pre>
you'd be in trouble, but you can't do that since blaze-html doesn't accept plain old strings. Instead, you'd write<p><pre><code>    ""<script>alert('XSS!');</script>"" :: Html
</code></pre>
Note how only the type is changed, but now, the string will be transparently converted to ""&lt;script&gt;alert('XSS!');&lt;/script&gt;"" before it's added to the document, and thus you're safe, without having to actually do anything different. The type signatures I gave are superfluous of course, since they'd be inferred automatically. The type system makes this kind of flaw impossible.<p>Plus, since blaze combinators are just Haskell, and the Html type is a monad, you can use all the usual Monad functions with Html:<p><pre><code>    ol $ mapM_ (li . toHtml) ['A'..'Z']
</code></pre>
That generates a 26-item list of letters from A to Z. Yes, you do have to do the explicit conversion to Html there, but I think that's a small price to pay for all the flexibility afforded by templating HTML with full-fledged Haskell code.<p>> But for templating, I just don't like embedding templates in the actual source code of the HTTP verb it's for. The main controller code should be about preparing data for the UI, and the UI should be separate from the controller code. You could put it in a separate file and function and import it, of course, but it's still Haskell code, which must be compiled along with the entire app, which slows down the development cycle a lot.<p>Yeah, I just put ""view code"" like the above examples into a separate module and import it. I don't find the slowdown to be significant, but maybe that's just me. In any case, true template languages have to be compiled too, either with the rest of the program or at runtime, so one way or another you incur that cost no matter what you're using.<p>> I haven't looked closely at the various web frameworks to see if they support Rails-style reloading (ie., recompiling and reloading the app on each page load). Do you know?<p>Yesod does this by default, and Snap can, if you use `snap-loader-dynamic` for your development builds. I believe they both use the awesome `hint` package for runtime eval and compilation of Haskell code. I don't think Happstack has any auto-reloading capability though.<p>> Why invent something that looks like HTML but isn't? HAML syntax is basically (almost) CSS selectors, that's the whole point. And again, it's apparently meant to be placed inline.<p>It doesn't seem <i>that</i> different from HAML to me, but it's clearly a subjective judgment. :) And it doesn't have to be inline. It uses the QuasiQuotes language extension, which means you can do inline snippets or write it in a separate file, however you like.<p>Hamlet, Cassius, Lucius, and Julius (collectively, the ""Shakespearean"" template languages) are developed by the Yesod framework guys, not Snap, by the way. Snap uses a template language called Heist by default, which I don't particularly care for (I just use blaze-html instead).<p>> Oh, interesting. I don't know about MonadIO yet. Will definitely read up on this.<p>If you use liftIO, you're using MonadIO. That's what liftIO does, it's an adapter between plain IO values and polymorphic MonadIO values. But if library authors use MonadIO instead of IO, you can omit the explicit conversion. This isn't something you really have control over as the user of a library though.<p>> With more complex libraries, the machine-generated docs become increasingly obtuse. For example, I would never, ever have figured out how to use HXT with Hackage alone. I mean, look at it!<p>Fully agreed. HXT is a huge, complex beast! I don't think it's fair to judge all libraries by that standard, though. HXT is clearly at an extreme end of that continuum.",1369353536

It's not as if you can call up an ambulance to pick you up and take you down to the pub for the night.

I have seen what very experienced ED nurses (and consultants, anaesthetists etc) do with their 'diagnosis' from films, despite numerous courses and flash qualifications. This is without taking the film. Do it for years, see lots of things, make lots of mistake and then you'll get good.
Radiography students are generally competent for unsupervised chest radiography after about 6 months to a year. This is working 2 days a week, study for 3 days. You could probably produce a crap film but good enough to show ET tube in significantly less time, but a good operator has other ways to verify tube placement. 
Portable x-ray in bigger towns provides a great service to rest homes, prisons etc and is fiddly and laborious. It's a niche market. The same (but less common) with mobile MRI. CT must be done somewhere in a mobile fashion, I haven't seen it.
It is easy to get a little twisted with terminology, but mobile x-ray generally means you push it around the hospital, portable meaning you carry it out the van, up the stairs, into the rest home (the 600kg mobile machine is not something you would carry easily).This terminology is widely abused though!",1369352702

The tech seen in the new Star Trek movies, rather than diminishing futurism, serves to show us that the future that Star Trek introduced to us these past few decades is <i>just around the corner</i>.  They are using devices we are now starting to see every day, and some tech that we can imagine our children using in the very near future.<p>Maybe that's not as exciting to some, but to have that mix of technology and design from the present day feels like a confirmation that a lot more Star Trek tech might become reality within our lifetimes :).",1369351700

But I can think of some novels that fill the role. The one that comes to mind most immediately is Neal Stephenson's Diamond Age, which revolves quite a bit around super advanced nanotechnology and AI. I could see a film adaptation of that being fairly awesome.",1369350108

If you get struck by lightning in Canada, UK or Australia then it's obviously a no brainer but the sad way in which the American health system works is that you pay for everything. An ambulance ride costs money, consultation costs money, tests cost money The guy has a family, spending large amounts of money only to be told that you're fine might give you and your family piece-of-mind, but it won't help with the savings (if you have any).<p>It's stories like this that make me thankful for living in Australia. It doesn't cost money to visit a public hospital or visit a doctor who bulk bills (no up-front costs), medication is heavily subsidised (antibiotics and other common drugs), tests are all mostly bulk-billed and heck some places even offer Government subsidised dental care. I got a scale, polish, check-up (including x-rays) and clean from my local dental hospital for $59, you're being seen by final year dental students who are being overseen by a senior dentist.<p>Jason will be fine by the looks of it. Understandably, I can see why he wouldn't want to see a doctor given the costs you might incur, but then you can't argue leaving your family fatherless is definitely a whole lot worse than short-term financial loss. We shouldn't judge though.",1369350063

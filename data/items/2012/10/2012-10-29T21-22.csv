Companies like Google and Facebook  in common with most public companies  have interests that are frequently in conflict with the wellbeing of  I was going to say their customers or their users, but Ill say people in general, since its wider than that. People who use their systems directly, people who dont  were all affected by it, and although some of the outcomes are positive a disturbingly high number of them are negative: the erosion of privacy, of consumer rights, of the public domain and fair use, of meaningful connections between people and a sense of true community, of beauty and care taken in craftsmanship, of our very physical wellbeing.

4714725,comment,4712230,4714656,4,0,eli_gottlieb,,,"But at-will employment is actually a separate issue from unionization.  At-will employment goes against what most countries and cultures regard as a cornerstone of capitalism itself: clarity and enforcement of contracts.<p>At-will employment: anyone can terminate the employment relationship at any time, unilaterally, for any reason or no reason.  The party in the stronger bargaining position can unilaterally demand changes at threat of leaving/firing, more or less whenever they want.<p>No at-will, no union: employment is governed by a contract negotiated and bound at the start of the job.  There are set terms, and agreed amounts of leeway.  Either party who decides to unilaterally cheat the other can be taken to court and legally held responsible to the other party.<p>Seriously, why should Americans consider it normal to sign a Nondisclosure Agreement when beginning work for a new company but completely out-of-the-blue to have the employer be legally responsible for granting so simple a ""privilege"" as a 40 hour work-week without threatening to fire you?<p>(Which, by the way, doesn't mean things like long work-weeks don't exist in ""contract employment"" countries.  My friend I mentioned has a standard week of 45 hours.  That length is <i>set by his contract</i>, which he agreed to.  What they can't do is sign him to a 45-hour week and then start regularly demanding 55 hours each week.  This pleasant standardization of his hours allows my friend to attend language-immersion classes after work to get his Hebrew up to par -- an absolute must for integrating fully into the Israeli economy as a competent worker.)",1351547814

In particular, how do I measure whether a citizen is prepared for a productive life or not?<p>I like that you ignored the latter half.<p>You don't measure the citizen. You measure the rate at which the country is liberalizing. That is, the rate at which its core philosophical attitude is becoming more individualist, egalitarian, meliorist, and universalist. The purpose of public education is to shift us from the medieval era into the modern era. (And to be clear, being conservative is the opposite of being radical; it does not contradict being liberal. Many things that belong on the political Right are legitimately liberal but not Left.)<p>How many people are concerned with individual rights? How many people demonstrate equal moral worth and status to all individuals? How many people have a positive outlook on the future? How many people recognize universal qualities in all human beings? The rate at which these indicators are moving is positive, but that rate should be increasing in a country with a strong educational system; you'd ask the questions differently in a different era.",1351547799

I was wondering what they were going to throw Mansfield on ever since they appointed his replacement and just designated him as basically someone who was going to work on a special project.<p>Sounds like a thrust towards driving Apple deeper into the bottom of the hardware stack to me.  Apple currently is very good at setting up good solid deep relationships with hardware suppliers and designing lots of stuff to make things work together.  But they've been pushing further and further down the stack ever since the PASemi acquisition.

4714689,comment,4712230,4714378,6,0,eli_gottlieb,,,"As with most communications distances, that depends entirely on where the other person is sitting.  I never use monads, for instance, and only use type-classes when they look really applicable.  Still, if the person I'm talking to has never heard of a map() primitive outside of MapReduce, that causes issues.<p>And then the #1 thing that <i>really</i> causes friction is recursion.  Most people interviewing on behalf of BigCo's seem to think recursive algorithms are <i>dirty</i> and will always/almost-always overflow your stack.  I learned in second-semester of freshman year of college that with a little work, every recursive algorithm can be made tail-recursive can be made iterative, and that rejecting recursion wholesale is premature optimization.<p>The best interviewer I had on the topic (who couldn't offer me a job because I'm a hardcore algorithms/CS guy and he ended up needing front-end web developers, no harm no foul) accepted my recursive answer and then proceeded by <i>asking me to make it iterative</i>.  That was the best, in my opinion, both because it shows a level of ""academic"" knowledge about recursion and iteration, but also because <i>it was exactly what I would have to do in a real job situation</i>: transform a theoretically correct algorithm into a usable implementation that can perform well.<p>The people I want to criticize are the ones who seem to believe, or want to believe, that <i>no such usable implementations of functional or academic techniques can exist</i>, categorically, and hence that anyone who answers a question with anything so ""functional"" as a recursive algorithm must be a stack-overflowing, head-in-the-clouds academic or simply an amateur.  Hence why I bring up Scala and why I'm not much of a Haskell programmer: it's damn well readable and usable for people who aren't functional-programming gurus, you can write code in it that plays well with CPU and memory, you can use a wide ecosystem full of libraries, and it comes with just enough functional magic baked into itself in just the right way to make the ""magic"" parts (like the Option functor) easy to learn and use for people who don't <i>care</i> about functional programming theory.",1351547489

Then two telephone interviews followed (with the recruiter and extensive interview with some developer), then they arranged an on-site interview. Apparently the 2nd tech phone interview wasn't needed.<p>For the on-site interview I got some paper-mail, where the position had been changed to SRE.. So I'm thinking to myself.. right, this is going to be interesting.<p>So I show up on-site, and 5 interviews follow, with a ~1hr lunch break in the middle.  The 1st guy who interviewed me was a bit pompous [hey, he had a PhD!], but OK; the 2nd and 3rd guys were extremely arrogant; the 4th guy (my supposed team-leader) seemed to have had a bad day but was otherwise OK; the 5th guy was the ONLY with whom I felt I could build accord and have an engaging conversation. With him, it didn't feel like an ""interview""; we were more like two equals talking about an interesting technical topic.<p>The guy who I had lunch with was... interesting.  Suffice it to say that I had the impression that he was on the verge of explicitly telling me NOT to take the position I was interviewed for. (As in, crappy job and crappy place to live in.)<p>They tried to impress me with how every employee gets two big screens, a laptop of their own choice, how big systems they're working with, how good the food in cantina was, the fancy office space, etc.. Their attitude was in general as if they were interviewing a teenager whose ""wet dream"" was to work for google.<p>I never found out what kind of project I would be working on. Everybody's attitude during the interview was ""you ask, and we'll tell you if it's not confidential"". The SRE position was briefly described as ""root on google.com"".<p>It turned out that I'd also be required to be periodically on-call (since the position went from SWE to SRE underway), and that the people I'd be working with would be the same people who interviewed me.<p>So I got an offer, a contract came in paper-post and I found out that I'd only be having ~15 workdays of paid vacation per year. Incidentally, in the country I was supposed to move to, it was allowed by the law to work NNN hours <i>unpaid</i> overtime per year... Guess whether NNN matched (or maybe was even greater!) than the number of paid vacation days.<p>I didn't take the offer, and it turned out to be a damn good choice.<p>I'm rather sure that somebody without other hobbies or desires to have some free time to spend on things other than computers would have had a different subjective experience.<p>[This post is deliberately vague about some details in order not to reveal too much about the persons involved.]",1351547245

4714639,comment,4712495,4714271,2,0,btilly,,,"Yeah.<p>That's a blog post that I should get around to writing a rebuttal to some day.  Because it is widely quoted and off base.<p>In theoretical frequentist math world, it is correct.  If you peek repeatedly, eventually you'll come to confidence when there is no difference.  Back in the real world, it is perfectly acceptable to use a strategy like, <i>""We'll set a really high confidence (eg 99.5%) for cut-off until we get to a couple of thousand successes, and then we'll drop our standards substantially (eg 95% cut-off).  If we are forced to stop for business reasons, we'll choose whatever happens to be ahead at the moment.""</i><p>And yes, I can use Bayesian statistics to demonstrate that following the strategy that I describe creates acceptably low probabilities of making somewhat wrong business decisions, while allowing you to make good business decisions more quickly.  And in practice people can follow it without needing a strong statistical background.  (If I did enough work I could come up with a sophisticated optimal curve to use in making decisions.  But I have not done that work, and in practice explaining it would be more work than it is worth.)<p>Why is this?  Two reasons.<p>The first is that you only really get ""independent peeks"" at different orders of magnitude of data.  Thus if you wait until you're past a small amount of data, you don't get a strong ""repeated looks"" effect.<p>Secondly coming to the wrong decision only matters to a business when the chosen option is substantially worse.  If you follow a rule like what I gave, your odds of accidentally making up your mind in the wrong way if there is a business-significant difference are surprisingly low.  For instance if you would detect a 2% difference as significant, and there is a real underlying difference of 1%, the odds that you're making the right decision right now deciding at a 95% confidence level is 99.2%.  And if the real difference is a 0.5% win, your odds of making the right decision right now is 91.5%.  (This despite the fact that you'd expect to need 16x as much data in order to even have a good chance of <i>detecting</i> a 0.5% win!)<p>Thus the decisions that you're making are usually correct.  And on the occasions where you make the wrong choice, the mistake is usually not materially worse.",1351546982

For example there are often city ordinances adding 0.25% to the sales tax to support something or other.

Here is the California voter guide: <a href=""http://voterguide.sos.ca.gov/pdf/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://voterguide.sos.ca.gov/pdf/</a><p>Here is what someone in my city would see as their ballot:  <a href=""http://www.votescount.com/nov12/root1106/ballots/bt000039.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.votescount.com/nov12/root1106/ballots/bt000039.pd...</a><p>It starts out with Obama and Romney, heads into Senate & Congress, then the state senate & assembly, then into county positions and finally city positions.  Then there are propositions for the state, county and city.<p>After that digression, the California sales taxes for purchases made in person are based on where the store is.  Except for cars which are based on the purchaser address.  For distance purchases (eg internet, mail order) they are based on where the business decides its tax presence is.  Amazon for example took that into account when deciding where to have their presence on opening in California and actually got some tax concessions from the ""lucky"" cities (yes corporate welfare is well established in the US).<p>For sales where the purchaser and seller are in different states no sales tax can be charged.  Most states then have a provision requiring the purchaser to report these purchases and pay a ""use"" tax whose rate is identical to the sales tax rate.

It is well worth the hour, either watching it or downloading the MP3 and listening to it on your commute, jog, etc.<p>One point the speaker, Rich Hickey, argues is that we have a bad habit of focusing too much on our experience sitting at our desks (""look how quickly I can do this one thing"") at the expense of complexity in the code.<p>It's a short view as opposed to a long view, since over time your project inevitably becomes larger and more complex. When you're trying to add a feature to a large, possibly mature product, you're seldom doing the same kind of work you see for a framework or language's demo code. Complexity will dominate everything else, to the point where it probably won't matter as much how easy it is to change the color on a div or whatever.<p>That said, if you can isolate complexity behind an API (not just hide it, but truly abstract it), it's probably better for your software. The problem is that software only seems to get more complex over time, and after a while your framework which ostensibly abstracts adds its own  complexity, complexity incidental to the problem at hand.<p>Anywasy, I sympathize. :) As I see it, programming as we know it tends to involve gluing together frameworks and APIs more often than it does writing raw code. It's a huge stack of abstractions and I wonder at what point it's futile to try to understand more than a certain subset.<p>That said, some people like being able to write code which ships almost instantly ~everywhere, or to a great many tiny computers in people's pockets. It's not all bad, right? It could be simpler, but it just isn't, so the decision is to take it or leave it. (Or try to replace it, but now you have two problems and/or N+1 frameworks.)",1351546150

This requires us to either 1) figure out what data we should be pushing or 2) push everything.<p>The first part is annoying because it's hard to predict what is needed and developers hate getting requests to add just one more piece of data to the email service.<p>The second part is not great because now we spend a bunch of resources sending everything and the third party can essentially replicate our database or we push so much data that it becomes cost prohibitive.<p>So we just built a simple logic builder around MailGun that handles sending email. It's not perfect (i.e. we don't have great analytics and all our emails go out at the same time ever day), but we can literally segment on anything. <i>Every single table in our database.</i> And for a service with use cases all over the place this saves me from sending stupid generic emails or from sending an email about sales to developers or an email about github to a marketer.<p>edit: my hope is still that a 3rd party service figures this out because I'd much rather pay someone for this than build it.

However in all my time I can say, that I have only run into one bug that was caused by weak typing and that was on the R auto-generated class.  Typically your strings are a R.strings, colours are at R.colours, etc so it makes it pretty easy to spot if you are passing a string through where you should be passing a colour.<p>I did java dev back in the 1.1 and 1.2 days - now that JVM sucked!

Why all this hype around someone that, while immensely impressive, is still only one of a large number of people doing amazing things?  Why do we not see so many articles on Elon Musk and Space-X from every magazine on the planet?  I can't seem to go a day without seeing a profile of Dorsey or about Square.

Mine was limited to files contained in ""the project"" (so none, if you just open a single file, not even nearby files) and the only way to open a a file outside of ""the project"" was to use the classic Ctrl+o. How ""modern"" that was!<p>> ""Now, these aren't just ""I want my editor to be pretty"" issues. A lot of these things are functionally important to get working faster on your code.""<p>But, somehow, all the issues in your list have something to do with looks and that's one of the most subjective subjects possible. RoundRects don't help anyone write better code faster: they help you feel better and more confident but nothing more. I'm actually a fan of minimalism and text-based interface and the ""fixes"" you want would be of no interest to me.<p>> ""- Making pop-up boxes, a-la Sublime Text, that moves you to a new file. Simply cannot be implemented in a nice-looking way in vim.""<p>I'd say that LustyExplorer looked quite good and now CtrlP both looks very good and does a lot more than ST2's Ctrl+P window.<p>> ""- Making some fonts smaller or bigger, to display extra information that isn't code. Simply impossible to do, because vim is a one-size font. This alone is a huge limitation.""<p>I fail to see how such a feature would make Vim or any editor better.<p>> ""- Making a decent-looking code-folding system. The code folding in vim doesn't look good, and since you're limited to one font size and to only putting in characters, you're stuck with the very ugly way of doing things. I'm a huge fan of vim folding, and the way of controlling them is just amazing. Except for the way it looks, which is terrible.""<p>Subjectivity again. How it looks is totally irrelevant: how it works is what matters. `za`, `zM`, `zR`, `zj` and friends are the important parts: add a nice gradient, a right-pointing shadowed arrow and rounded corners and you simply have the exact same feature with a shiny look that suits your taste.

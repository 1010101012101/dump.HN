At a higher level, does it bother anyone else even slightly that more and more of the world&#x27;s priorities are being set by fewer and fewer people? This is how it&#x27;s been to some extent for millennia. But, with increasing income/wealth disparity in the world, its effect is amplified.<p>This, of course, is a terrible example because I&#x27;m sure most can agree that attempting to cure such a devastating disease is worthy of funding. This is also not to disparage wealthy individuals (indeed, many would include me in the bunch).<p>It just seems that very little sees the light of day unless an increasingly small group of people deem it so worthy. And, something about seeing the priorities of even our non-profits dictated by these few gives me pause. Yes, I know that philanthropy, foundations, etc. have always existed but, again, the rate of increase of absolute power and control accreting back to so few people like the days of yore seems inconsistent with freedom, democracy, and all the other good stuff so many have come to idealize for good reason.",1390503581

I guess you could call me a skeptic, but I try very hard to be a thoughtful skeptic.<p>What makes the whole conversation unproductive is there appears to be two sides: one which argues there is no problem and we must do nothing, and the other side says that the problem is going to end the world as we know it and we must change our entire way of living and make it our number one priority.<p>For me, there is a progression of questions that I must answer before I can sign on to the latter&#x27;s assertions., And they look something like this:<p>1. Is the world warming?  I think it most certainly is, but I would also note that it appears that the warming trend has halted for the past 10 to 20 years. From what I can gather, scientists have reasons why that might be the case but have not explained it.<p>2. Is the warming man-made? To a large degree, I believe that it is. However, there are a lot of things that we don&#x27;t understand about climate (solar cycles, effects of water vapor, ocean CO2 sequestration, etc.) If I had to put a number on it, I would say 50 to 60% man-made.<p>3. Can we do anything about it? This is where I begin to separate from the global warming crowd. Theoretically, we can certainly do something about it, but having worked in government I just don&#x27;t see any practical way that we can reduce greenhouse emissions to such an extent that it&#x27;s going to make a great difference. Further, china and India are ramping up their CO2 emissions, and there&#x27;s nothing that the developed countries can do about it. Finally, I have ethical objections to telling developed countries that they have to use less energy which will inevitably result in more lives lost due to starvation or simply just malnutrition and poverty.<p>4. Should we do anything about it? I believe this is a cost-benefit analysis. And I haven&#x27;t done the analysis myself, but sometimes I question whether spending the enormous amounts of money today is worth putting off an uncertain disaster tomorrow when we have actual problems today that we could be working on instead.  We have millions of people every year dying from malnutrition, poor water supplies, malaria, HIV/AIDS, etc. Why not save those actual lives instead of spending the money saving hypothetical lives in 100 years. And indeed, won&#x27;t we be more suited to save those lines in 100 years than we are right now, meaning that the mitigation effort could be a lot cheaper?",1390503189

I grew frustrated trying to edit Haskell in Emacs; there are a bunch of half-baked modes out there.  The problem is that without a good mode, even basic tasks like indentation are painful in Emacs, while Vim will indent anything well without a specific mode.<p>Often cited as Emacs&#x27; biggest advantages is how it integrates with other tools or, perhaps, how Emacs can become those tools. You can run your debugger in Emacs. You can read mail in Emacs.  You can do version control in Emacs. The problem is that Emacs is never truly good at any of those other things. Running a shell in a buffer has problems. (You can run a shell inside a real terminal emulator in Emacs, but by that point you might as well just use a real terminal outside of Emacs.) Emacs is not a great mail reader. It&#x27;s not great at doing version control and, what&#x27;s more, it doesn&#x27;t keep you from having to learn your underlying VCS, so now you have to know two ways to do things.  Same goes for dired--it&#x27;s a completely different way to manage files, but you still need to know how to use a real shell, so it just ends up being too much trouble to learn dired.<p>The thing is, when you strip out all the other stuff Emacs is supposedly good for--managing files, being a terminal, etc.--all you&#x27;re left with is a middling editor with a good lisp interpreter. That other stuff is supposed to make Emacs great, but it all ends up being middling too.<p>So I have switched back to Vim. It excels at being an editor and doesn&#x27;t try to do other stuff. In some ways Emacs is still better (for instance its support for multiple &quot;frames&quot; is something Vim can&#x27;t get close to.) But with Vim I spend less time fiddling with the editor and more time editing text. If I ever need to do something for which there is an outstanding Emacs mode (edit XML, for instance) I will load up Emacs for that.  But without a good mode Emacs is not worth it.",1390503108

For example, the identities of overseas informants ought not to be disclosed, lest they be immediately imprisoned or executed by their governments. Nor should there be a Twitter feed giving up-to-the-minute location data on US special forces teams. These examples seem farcical, but they illustrate the point that at least <i>some</i> operational details genuinely deserve secrecy. (Unless you reject the underlying premise that the United States should conduct intelligence and military operations overseas at all. But that&#x27;s a very different discussion.)<p>But even though specific details may need to be kept secret--for a reasonable amount of time, until they&#x27;re no longer actionable by enemies--the <i>nature</i> of the government&#x27;s ongoing practices ought to be disclosed.<p>The latter case--wherein lower-level officials are permitted to make judgment calls in time-sensitive emergencies--is rather different. This is the situation contemplated by the White House during the Cold War.<p>As the reasoning went, the American nuclear deterrent must be credible, or else the Soviets would seize the opportunity and launch an unprovoked attack on the US, Germany, or both. If a communication breakdown between the White House and the military could render the nuclear arsenal unusable, that would tend to diminish the credibility of the deterrent. On the other hand, the risk of a lower-level official making the wrong judgment call and starting a world war is appreciable.<p>Given these considerations, reasonable people could disagree on what the optimal policy would be. It is not unreasonable or morally repugnant to conclude that certain trusted military officers should be granted the authority to make a judgment call when a) the situation is an emergency, and b) the chain of command has broken down.<p>Again, the key distinction here is between <i>ongoing practices</i> and <i>emergency measures in a hypothetical, worst-case scenario.</i> That distinction must affect our moral judgment of the respective policies.",1390502716

Because of diffraction from the wave nature of light -- which wasn&#x27;t understood back then -- these calculations said that if the stars were the same size as the sun they couldn&#x27;t be much farther away than the farthest planets. Which would be close enough to see annual parallax if the earth really did move around the sun.<p>And so because of this and a couple other reasons, Copernicus had to resort to proof-by-theology since the available evidence appeared to disagree with his position.",1390502637

7110165,comment,7108684,7109661,7,0,judah,,,"Bill Gates just addressed this [1], showing the faulty thinking behind this idea that saving lives is ultimately bad for the earth.<p>&quot;It may be counterintuitive, but the countries with the most deaths have among the fastest-growing populations in the world. This is because the women in these countries tend to have the most births, too.<p>This pattern of falling death rates followed by falling birth rates applies for the vast majority of the world. Demographers have written a lot about this phenomenon. The French were the first to start this transition, toward the end of the 18th century. In France, average family size went down every decade for 150 years in a row. In Germany, women started having fewer children in the 1880s, and in just 50 years family size had mostly stabilized again. In Southeast Asia and Latin America, average fertility dropped from six or seven children per woman to two or three in a single generation, thanks in large measure to the modern contraceptives available by the 1960s.<p>Because most countries—with exceptions in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia—have now gone through this transition, the global population is growing more slowly every year. As Hans Rosling, a professor at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden and one of my favorite data geeks, said, “The amount of children in the world today is probably the most there will be! We are entering into the age of the Peak Child!”&quot;<p>Saving lives will improve humanity and -- as humanity has discovered -- actually contributes to fewer births. This is one of the reasons we see shrinking populations in 25 nations including Japan, Ukraine, Italy, Greece. [2]<p>The reality is that saving lives counterintuitively decreases population through lower birth rates, which may ultimately help the earth.<p>Also, observe that the world is at its highest population today, and yet, billions of humans are totally resource-secure. Why this counter-intuitive phenomenon? It&#x27;s largely thanks to technological advancements in farming and genetics. There is no reason to believe this trend will not continue.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://annualletter.gatesfoundation.org/?cid=bg_gn_ll0_012023#section=myth-three"" rel=""nofollow"">http://annualletter.gatesfoundation.org/?cid=bg_gn_ll0_01202...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_decline"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_decline</a>",1390502625

We didn&#x27;t want to create one more. Instead we focused on creating easy, one-day workshop to get you to try and see what programming and technology is about, while also building your first sample application and getting meet the local tech scene. After the workshop we tell the people that you now have all the tools and contacts you need for programming or creating something. It&#x27;s up to you to learn more.<p>The important part was that all these people (probably thousands at this point) got over the first step and of whom many wouldn&#x27;t have touched programming otherwise.<p>In the same way I don&#x27;t think this book should be about teaching programming that much, but more as creating stories and personalities for technologies to peak interest. Children&#x27;s interest usually leads to questions and to more interest. You can then use  that energy, answer the questions, teach more and extend the workbook exercises to more challenging things. You can also use those characters as a basis to explaining the technology world or talking about what you do for living.<p>The point is that when you&#x27;re trying to get a new demographic interested, you need to find a way to get them over the first step, which is to get them involved and getting them interested. The earlier this happens, the better.<p>Why project like this and the Goldie Box are important, is that they create a story, a world and excitement around technology, for those who might miss or haven&#x27;t found their innate interest yet.",1390502248

Job anniversaries from my network\n2. Who&#x27;s viewing my profile\n3. An invitation to try LinkedIn Ads\n4. LinkedIn Pulse (more network updates)\n5. New jobs in my area<p>Damn. Yes, I&#x27;m sure I can (and will) opt-out of any or all of these, but what kind of default is it to bombard customers with so many e-mails? It&#x27;s insane really. Also comes off a bit self-important and arrogant.<p>I sort of subconsciously noticed a creeping increase in communications from them, but it really just hit me today. That may be because I just realized yesterday that I was getting actual &quot;Likes&quot; and comments on a new profile photo I uploaded. Why are they trying to be Facebook? That&#x27;s not why I signed up.<p>It started as a good idea, but they&#x27;ve layered on crap that takes my time/focus and adds no value, given its purported purpose. Why do I need to know or congratulate someone for being on their job another year? Why do I care that they updated their profile pic? At least 75% of the updates via e-mail and their &quot;feed&quot; are 100% useless and seem like weak excuses to somehow keep me connected to LinkedIn.<p>And now, 5 e-mails by midday.

You&#x27;re no longer working or networking. Instead, you&#x27;re spending your time managing LinkedIn and possibly paying them for the honor.<p>Maybe I&#x27;m a bit crusty today, but too many things are working to insinuate themselves into our lives these days and trying to demand our attention. It&#x27;s especially off-putting when a service like LinkedIn positions itself as a must-have for professionals, people buy into the notion, then the service begins to morph and &quot;take over&quot;.<p>Maybe it&#x27;s time to unplug and link out.",1390502062
7110085,comment,7107154,7107230,2,0,arca_vorago,,,"&quot; Not one American has been found who has been demonstrably harmed by any NSA program.&quot;<p>Of course, this statement heavily relies on what you mean by &quot;demonstrably&quot; and &quot;harm&quot;. What is the standard of proof you would require to demonstrate harm? As you say it, it sounds like one of those terms that you can forever pushback against and say &quot;but X didn&#x27;t demonstrate harm sufficiently&quot;.<p>The most likely harm that I would consider widespread would be the chilling effect. For example, Chris Hedges and others tried to sue the gov for the NDAA&#x27;s chilling effect, but once they got to court it was thrown out because they had &quot;no standing&quot;. So it&#x27;s pretty obvious that you can&#x27;t say that a court ruling on something demonstrates harm, because the courts themselves are part of the harm occurring.<p>As a matter of fact, I bet I could have a pretty good claim that the NSA program has harmed me. I am an Iraq combat vet with PTSD, and happened to be someone who has talking about the NSA doing this stuff since the early 2000&#x27;s. At my last meeting with the VA, I specifically stated that I was concerned at the confidentiality of my talks due to their being entered in an electronic system that I suspected the NSA and other three-letters would have access to. Therefore I quit my PTSD treatment because I felt I could not trust the VA system or any claims of doctor-patient confidentiality. I actually asked the doc to make sure she typed that into the system so that in the future I could use it as evidence if the need ever arose. I&#x27;m doing fine now mostly of my own volition, but what I think about is how many other vets had the same gut feeling and kept their problems hidden and suffered greatly for it?<p>This is only one example that I think is pretty concrete.",1390502057

If the entire ad market collapsed and products instead needed to compete on price, quality and overall value delivered to the customer, we would all be better off. Advertising allows firms to compete in a vector which provides me no benefits.<p>I would love it if we had a law that said once a product achieves more than something like 10% market share, it could no longer be advertised. Advertising for new unknown products makes sense. Once I know about a product, advertising just serves to divert resources from making the product better and to generate noise that dilutes the message from new products of which I might not be aware.<p>One of the biggest problems in this country and all countries are people who live their live accepting what they are told, instead of seeking out an answer to their questions and doubts on their own. People accept information from Fox, CNN, NY Times, NY Post, radio, advertisements, etc. at face value. Culturally, we would all be better off with an attitude like those who read and write the reviews for products on Amazon. I and every other customer get 1000x the value from Amazon reviews than I get from advertising. It has saved me from buying many many dud products and helped me discover the products that provide the best value. Plus, there is only so much any manufacturer can do to game those reviews since it is eventually self-correcting (i.e. pay for good reviews increases sales among the misled, who later show up and post most honest reviews that will be less favorable or downright negative)",1390501973

7110070,comment,7109093,7109638,4,0,jgon,,,"I would say that the pattern does not take into account the actual details of the types of automation that have been occurring and further, it takes a myopic view of &quot;unemployment&quot; to prove itself correct.  In fact, automation has caused massive unemployment through history if you broaden your view of what &quot;employment&quot; means.<p>The first stage of automation/industrialization used crude technology in the simplest way, for the brute force it could provide.  At first you needed your factory to be close to a river so you could use a water wheel for power, and you needed a team of oxen to plow your field.  In both of these cases all you needed was linear power greater than a human could provide.  Once we figured out steam power and the ability to create simple linear motion in a piston, we didn&#x27;t have to build our factories on rivers anymore, and thus rivers became &quot;unemployed&quot; in the sense that we no longer had to &quot;employ&quot; them to create things.  Same with animals such as oxen that just provided simple brute force pulling/pushing something.  Think about the relative ubiquity of the term &quot;ox&quot; in literature from the past and then think about the last time you actually saw an ox.  Clearly animals have been dealing with rampant unemployment for quite a while.<p>The second stage of industrialization moved up the food chain and focused on automating things that were repetitive but required more complicated movements and dexterity.  The sort of thing that we used to rely on assembly lines to do and such.  At the previous level we replaced providers of brute labor with no dexterity.  At this level we replaced providers of fine but repetitive labor, and still unemployment wasn&#x27;t that bad because people could still move up the value chain and do finer labor that required decision making.<p>The third stage of industrialization focused on replacing fine labor that required decision making, where now you have a giant robotic arm that handles all of the spot welding, painting, and assembly of a car for example.  If you don&#x27;t think that this has resulted in a rise in unemployment then you haven&#x27;t travelled through the American mid-west recently. Because at this third stage we are starting to replace people who are then unable to move up the value chain into labor based solely on analysis and reasoning, both because there are fewer of these jobs and because not everyone can do them.<p>We are now in the fourth stage of industrialization and it is here that we are really going to come to grips with massive automation induced unemployment, because automation has moved sufficiently up the value chain, from brute force, to fine but repetitive labor, to labor requiring limited decision making, and finally to labor requiring reasoning as its primary component.  Look outside your window, look at all of the cabs driving down the street and realize that once a computer can drive a car, and it will be able to in a decade or less, all of those jobs will be obsolete. And if a computer can drive a car it can probably analyze an x-ray or mri, it can translate a document via ocr, it can cook your fast food, it can write a sports recap, and it can balance the books.  Once this level of the value chain is displaced where do these people go? Into jobs requiring creative work? Jobs requiring design or analytical work? How many of those will there be, and is that a realistic alternative for everyone?<p>No, the Luddite Fallacy is just a convenient way to avoid thinking about the implications of the technology we build and what is happening to people as we work our way higher and higher up the value chain, crowding those at the bottom either up into the next level or out of the employment market. As as we start to reach levels which are practically the limit for larger and larger amounts of people we can expect to see greater and greater unemployment unless we figure out a way to grapple with these repercussions.",1390501961

HTML forms can&#x27;t include custom HTTP headers, and you can&#x27;t make Ajax requests (which can have custom headers) to different domains due to the same-origin policy - so the presence of an X-Requested-With header should be enough to &quot;prove&quot; that the request came from the same domain as you and not from a site run by an attacker.<p>Unfortunately certain versions of the Flash and JavaScript plugins allow requests to be made to other domains with custom headers, which left CSRF holes open.",1390501884

On larger, longer-term projects I&#x27;ve worked on, we&#x27;ve gone through pretty elaborate effort not only to package the third-party code along with our own, but also to carefully manage what versions we&#x27;re using while hiding that detail from the actual program (so that, for instance, version numbers don&#x27;t infect the #include directives in the source code). Golang&#x27;s package system does a good job of streamlining this process, so that as long as you don&#x27;t try to use it like Rubygems, you can create a reliable build environment for an important program with little effort.<p>Idiomatic bundler, on the other hand --- and, just take my word for it that we&#x27;ve seen a <i>lot</i> of different teams Gemfiles --- treats something like &quot;haml&quot; or &quot;eventmachine&quot; as something akin to a system dependency; versions, when specified, are often fuzzy, like &quot;anything from 1.1.0 to 1.1.9 is acceptable&quot;. Ultra-specific versioning in Gemfiles is brittle; a &quot;bundle install&quot; on a mostly-rigid Gemfile can be expected to routinely fail as one gem&#x27;s dependency on another fails a constraint in the file.<p>There&#x27;s an upside to the Bundler mechanism, which is that it&#x27;s very easy to use and doesn&#x27;t require you to think about the actual code. In fact, Rubygems even hides cross-language dependencies, so that you can easily use libraries that happen to be native C code without even having to know that you&#x27;re bridging. But there&#x27;s a downside too, which is that it&#x27;s opaque and, like I said, brittle.<p>Basically you have to decide whether tracking your upstreams is more important than having a deterministic build. The C programmer in me is obsessed with deterministic builds, and Golang appeals to the C programmer in me, not the Ruby programmer.<p>Again, it&#x27;s totally legitimate to complain that there isn&#x27;t a widely-supported npm-alike for Golang. I don&#x27;t necessarily want one of those, but I can see how a competent programmer would! I&#x27;m just saying that it&#x27;s not reasonable to compare &quot;go get&quot; to npm; they aren&#x27;t systems with the same goals, even though they sort of look like they are.",1390501785

I&#x27;d say the mainstream of American conservatives are both pro-business but also very concerned with maintaining American power, prosperity, influence, and culture. Heck, a lot of those people are quite religious, too. And that amalgam certainly defines the rhetoric of conservatives in the mainstream, especially as you drill down from national to state-level. The question for those people is: what happens when the interests of trans-national corporations are not aligned with the interests of maintaining American power, prosperity, influence, and culture? Historically, they haven&#x27;t had to grapple with this question, because within the theory of their worldview, what was good for say IBM was good for America. A bigger, stronger IBM only meant more jobs for Americans and more returns for American shareholders. Trans-national corporations overturn these established assumptions.",1390500932

Machines are more efficient at some of these tasks, humans at others. Over time, machines have been able to do a greater portion of these tasks efficiently.<p>Today, machines are mostly complements. They help humans do tasks more efficiently. But as machines get better, they&#x27;re able to do a larger portion of tasks. At some point, they&#x27;ll start substituting for people. This has happened for some basic jobs in the past, but not to the extent we&#x27;ll soon see.<p>On the bright side, the limiting factor in most of our economy today is people. Machines can be mass-produced, but raising and training people is hard. Machines can augment people, but run into diminishing returns. Having two monitors won&#x27;t make you twice as productive, and two keyboards won&#x27;t let you type twice as fast. If we can do all the tasks in our economy without people, we can get <i>insane</i> growth rates in GDP.<p>Unfortunately, with no people in the economy, everyone would be out of work. Only the machine owners (or investors) would benefit. Everyone else would be dependent on social programs or charity.<p>In Robin&#x27;s example, AI is the machine that can do all tasks. But we don&#x27;t need to build such amazing machines before putting a lot of people out of work. Most jobs are not AI-complete.",1390500807

In a couple of projects I ended up implementing $myproj/types which exports all the data structures I want. At that point adding the types.TypeName.Min()/.Max()/... becomes natural. It&#x27;s already effectively a custom struct, so I have no problem writing the helper functions to deal with them.<p>Heck, I used to do that in C all the time anyway.<p><i>However...</i> The dependency management is my pet peeve #1. I see no problem pulling dependencies from external repositories and building them locally. That practice spans back to at least BSD ports.

Go decides internally which revision to checkout and build, using a priority list of hardcoded tag/branch names. If those are not available, it defaults to master:HEAD, /trunk or whatever equal alternative is supported by the underlying SCM. You <i>can not</i> specify &quot;I want to use _this_ version, period&quot; which is a crying shame.<p>I understand that internally Google doesn&#x27;t use go get at all. They have their own mirrored repos for everything they need during their builds. Understandable. But ignoring the well-established practice of user-specified upstream component versions is just rude.

Whether remote or working in an office space, daily standups, commit logs and the delivery of results can go a long way in figuring out if someone is actually getting stuff done, or is just pretending to busy at a desk.<p>There are a couple of things people don&#x27;t seem to address enough though.<p>- A lot of software development involves a group people designing and debating the architecture in front of a whiteboard. Most of this discussion is not preemptive, but rather happens on the spur of the moment.<p>- I strongly believe (but no data to back this up) that you are more productive when you work with a team you are comfortable with, both technically and on an informal social basis. This involves intense coding sprints through late nights or just having a couple drinks at the bar in the corner of the street.<p>I would be happy if working remotely really works for programmers, but everyone seems to be talking about the wrong issues.",1377987978

It was about 2AM and I was walking past his last known location according to the GPS. I called his name and heard him meowing. The meowing was coming from the sunporch of the house at that location. I was so relieved to find him that I went up to the house and opened the door of the sunporch to let him out. Luckily the door was unlocked otherwise I would hav cut the screen to get to him. He was very groggy and his collar was missing. After I got him home I discovered that he had been neutered. I came back the next night and confronted her about it. She wouldn&#x27;t open the door for me, saying she &quot;never opens the door for anyone she doesn&#x27;t know.&quot; I was recording on my phone but it ran out of space about 8 minutes in. She was obviously guilty but there was no hard evidence and I never pursued the matter. He recently died of the cancer he was born with, and the reason I don&#x27;t have any kitties is because she neutered him. Otherwise his legacy would have survived, because I was going to breed him and raise his kittens myself. Now all that&#x27;s left of him are my memories and my photos.

It&#x27;s a mix between old school C and C++, taking some good/bad from both.<p>The language is fully documented too, see <a href=""http://www.templeos.org/Wb/Doc/HolyC.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.templeos.org/Wb/Doc/HolyC.html</a>.<p>The entire OS runs in a single memory space, so processes communicating with each other is as simple as writing to that processes memory space and telling to go execute.<p>All of the .z files you find in the source tree directories are a gzip like algorithm that on the fly in the OS automatically unzips them, and then compiles the code contained within.<p>The interesting thing is that while the programs are generally just in time compiled, the main startup programs can&#x27;t be, however you can easily change the OS and re-run the compiler, overwrite the already started OS and continue on. The compiler CAN write binaries but it is not recommended by the author.<p>And I may have spent entirely too much time in this ;-).<p>The author may be a schizophrenic, what he has built is kinda neat.",1377986669

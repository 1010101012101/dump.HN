6176737,comment,6174514,6176052,3,0,iyulaev,,,"Some vendors follow your suggested model, and are very open with support and documentation. Other vendors (some of the biggest are in this group) have terrible/non-existent documentation and provide application-specific support by shipping an engineer with the product.<p>Modern SoCs demand thousands of pages to cover all available features and possible applications, and putting together that documentation in a self-consistent way is a challenge. Some vendors have decided that supporting low-revenue clients is not worth the cost of putting together said general-purpose documentation and providing support to each and every buyer. They&#x27;d rather not sell you the product in the first place than sell you something and stiff you on documentation & support, which is a reasonable position.<p>Often when you&#x27;re a low-quantity company you deal with low-quantity vendors who are willing to support you. When you move to high volume you might prefer to keep working with the chips you know. But when your operations guy comes back to you and says that the Big Co (who wouldn&#x27;t talk to you in the past) can sell you chips for $5 less, that&#x27;s $50M you just saved (given your 10M unit quantity). So you switch. In this example you have two different vendors: high cost / high support, low cost / &quot;exclusive&quot; support. Both have markets, just different ones.<p>TI is an example of a vendor that is very hobbyist / small quantity friendly. Even that wasn&#x27;t enough to save them - they&#x27;ve pulled out of the phone SoC business.",1375923508

It&#x27;s actually easier than copywriting since you have a better feedback cycle (oh god, prospect seems disinterested).<p>You&#x27;re in a mall. People are strolling around, and you have your booth standing in the middle, trying to hustle your product. A lot of people look at your booth (impressions), but only a couple stop by (clicks). You try to go the creative route. Here&#x27;s some of the things you made sure of.<p>1. Your booth is designed like a tank. It could withstand a lot of people, and a lot of product. That did cost you a pretty penny, but it&#x27;ll be worth it.<p>2. It&#x27;s designed completely in flat design. How amazing is that? Of course the designer wasn&#x27;t cheap, but it&#x27;ll be worth it, because he&#x27;s a creative genius.<p>3. You read somewhere that a sales persuasion shouldn&#x27;t be long, not longer than a minute (1 page). Else people will stop listening, and rejection hurts (your ego). So even if people want to hear more, you cut them short.<p>4. Your sales presentation is literary award worthy. Almost all your words are eloquently selected, but none of the people that come by your stand seem to understand them.<p>5. In order for your prospects to know what they&#x27;re getting, you add a lot of the technical specs to what you&#x27;re saying. This toaster has a capacity of 4 slices and a power output of 1500W. It&#x27;s controlled by an ATXmega2048SU and a XILINX Spartan 3 FPGA and has an integrated touch screen...you never really get past that point because most people leave.<p>So all considered, you have the perfect booth.

Being Ineligible for Federal grants is one thing, but so long as you filled out a FAFSA you were still eligible for school grants, private grants, and private student loans with deferred interest payments. That&#x27;s a huge incentive to complete a FAFSA. Even people who have used up their Federal and State aid should keep their FAFSA going and check their school&#x27;s financial aid office for other types of aid.<p>Case in point: in high school I lined up thousands of dollars in financial aid that no one else bothered to apply to. The largest check being $4,000 from my Alumni association for writing two paragraphs about how much I liked my school. A white friend of mine even got a NAACP scholarship because no one else applied (In case you don&#x27;t believe this happens or think I&#x27;m joking, see [1] (not my friend). No one seemed to mind in his case).<p>I had some family issues and then had a falling out with my family and was locked out of FAFSA until I turned 23. Now THAT is something that does made you ineligible for pretty much any financial aid aside from traditional loans and working a lot. That really sucked. I ended up having not finishing my bachelors as a result. Thankfully Community College worked out pretty well for me.<p>[1]\n<a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/12/jeffrey-warren-white-student-scholarship_n_1591055.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/12/jeffrey-warren-whit...</a>",1375921794

I 86&#x27;ed a longer explanation of what I meant, but here goes:<p>When I say, &quot;I also enjoy letting my mind wander and think about what Id do with a nine-figure windfall,&quot; I actually mean that I think about it, not that I fantasize about it.  Some of my problems would go away.  Others wouldn&#x27;t.  I&#x27;d have a whole new set of issues to think about.  And I&#x27;d still come in to work [0] tomorrow.<p>When I think about what it would be like to win the Powerball jackpot, I tend to reflect on some of the issues raised in PG&#x27;s &quot;Cities and Ambition&quot; essay [1], when he talks about the things different cities value: &quot;New York is pretty impressed by a billion dollars even if you merely inherited it. In Silicon Valley no one would care except a few real estate agents. What matters in Silicon Valley is how much effect you have on the world.&quot;<p>The utility I get from buying a lottery ticket isn&#x27;t about dreams of private jets and caviar.  It&#x27;s the perspective I gain: if I didn&#x27;t have to think about money ever again, what would I want to do with my life?  I think I&#x27;d keep working on startups.  What would I do differently?  I&#x27;m not sure, but I&#x27;d start with buying a better set of wheels for my bike.  In the bigger picture, I&#x27;d probably spend more time on projects that have the potential to have huge impact, and think less about whether a particular idea can be a profitable business.<p>It&#x27;s easy to get caught up in the patterns of daily life.  Thinking about winning a jackpot makes me evaluate my life from 30,000 feet.  I guess I could do that for free, but at least for me, that $2 gets me thinking a little differently.

[1] I think he gets to the heart of the disagreement between these two sides, explaining why large groups of poor people, for instance, vote Republican despite this being against their own self interest (workplace safety, minimum wage, workers&#x27; rights, etc.).<p>That said, it seems sometimes that even indisputable facts (dangers of cigarette smoke, seriousness of lead poisoning, and more recently, anthropomorphic climate change and the proven failures of &quot;trickle-down&quot; economics) are frequently politicized such that people end up believing that there&#x27;s still a debate among experts, and that all politicians are lying to support their own side.

A single woman I know who lives alone got denied financial aid because her gross annual income was 31k instead of the limit of 29k that financial aid requires.  If you do the math and include all average expenses for any single person, you&#x27;ll see that there&#x27;s no way to pay for tuition and/or housing without a student loan in a situation as this.  Is financial aid only supposed to be for people who either have no job at all, are completely poor, or are doing fraud?",1375920304

And the merry-go-round goes on and on.<p>So you have to pick one and fix it. It&#x27;s an engineering problem.<p>So for example, you have to fix campaign finance. The people in Washington aren&#x27;t going to fix campaign finance in Washington because the system that exists is the one that got them elected. Ditto for the people in Sacramento, Albany, etc. But wait, you can have Sacramento and Albany fund the federal campaigns of Senators running in California and New York (and so on). State Senators don&#x27;t get money from K Street, they get money from an entirely different set of lobbyists, so you can get the bills through by taking advantage of the regional weakness of the specific opponents. And then do it the other way around and have the federal government pass a national campaign finance bill for state-level offices.<p>That is obviously not a trivial undertaking, but we can&#x27;t jut say &quot;damn it, we&#x27;re stuck in a cycle&quot; and throw up our hands or it&#x27;ll never get fixed.",1375920274
6176509,comment,6176222,6176222,12,0,SholaJS,,,"Have you ever worked hard for something and then realized it wasn&#x27;t enough? Or worse, working hard brought you to this point, alone and unable to pay for school? It&#x27;s clear that if she&#x27;s writing this, she&#x27;s trying talking to financial aid. She&#x27;s tried saving as much as possible for school. She&#x27;s tried all the options... but none were left for her. I go to Stanford and I found myself in a slightly similar situation on a smaller scale. I had $1.2k in debt before the start of the year. Yes you read that right, just over one thousand.<p>Well... Stanford won&#x27;t disperse financial aid if you have a balance of over $1k. So, I had 2 days before school started and I didn&#x27;t have the money to head back to school. No matter who I talked to or who I called, the story was the same. That $1k was my responsibility but to be honest, I didn&#x27;t have it. That summer I barely made enough to support myself. I also maxed out my credit cards and because of my family situation, I didn&#x27;t have a cosigner that could help me co-sign a private loan. I also couldn&#x27;t apply for a loan through my school because that was also considered financial aid. That night I cried... so much. I called my financial aid office over and over only for them to tell me the same thing. I called relatives. I even begged my brother for a small loan just so I could register for classes (which he never gave btw). The next day at work I burst into tears for seemingly no reason at all. Why should I? I go to a school with all the bells and whistles. Why would that be a concern? Had a sorority sister not heard me crying, I would never have gotten the money to enroll.<p>It&#x27;s because the system is broken. This story is not about amounts or what she &quot;could&#x27;ve done,&quot; it&#x27;s about the reality of being in a situation you can&#x27;t possibly control.",1375920262

That manager transitioned me to a part-time employee at the end of the internship period after the school year started. In the latter two years of college I was a full time employee while going to school. Now, I took five years to graduate a four year degree, but since I was cashflow positive (yay low cost cal-state tuition) and employed in a topical field, the extended time really didn&#x27;t matter. Now the manager was somewhat devious because I don&#x27;t think the internships were necessarily supposed to work that way for all interns, but really it worked out well for both me and the company in the long term.<p>It would be worth probing the internship company in this case to see if some similar arrangement could be made. (if the budget for tuition vs part/full time pay works out, I did this in the 90&#x27;s, no idea how it would work now).",1375920132

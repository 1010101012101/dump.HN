Also if you have 2 instances running then they combine the monthly quota for you. But, how much network capacity one can use is actually limited by the network connectivity the machine offers.<p>For example, the $20 a month VPS on Linode offers only 250 Mbps connectivity (outgoing bandwidth). So as soon as you saturate that, you need one more VPS to handle the load. So this leaves a lot of bandwidth quota unused. Especially since in the real world traffic tends to come in spikes. AWS is similar, depending on the instance size the network connectivity differs. This makes the calculations for estimating costs for hosting even more difficult.",1452067065

You have to do quite a bit of image manipulation in digital to get that &quot;super 8&quot; look, and it isn&#x27;t always that convincing. Same with black/white photography vs. digital -- the way a digital chip reacts to light is very different than the way chemicals in film react, and some film stocks have a range and tone that is very hard to emulate with digital images. I don&#x27;t think it is a question of which is &quot;better&quot; but rather that aesthetic that an individual wants. You have to learn lighting techniques in a new way when you switch from celluloid to digital, and a good DP&#x27;s intimate understanding of how a particular film stock will respond in the shadows and highlights no longer applies when dealing with a very different medium.",1452066961

They didn&#x27;t have the same aptitude for numbers and maths as a CS, Maths or Physics students. The class found the whole exercise of programming complicated and stressful. The same course had earlier been offered to Physics students, who reported to have enjoyed it thoroughly. Given this, I think a text manipulation based tutorial can work better for students who need to learn programming and do not have good aptitude for math. Of course, some amount of math has to be picked up in order to become a competent programmer, but this exposure can come later for the not so math savvy students.",1452066542

And this from a group of people who have routinely postured extreme zeal for freedom and liberty since the early 90&#x27;s and produced one Snowden.<p>That&#x27;s a pretty bad record by any standards, and indicates the urgent need for self reflection, industry bodies, standards, whistle blower protection and for a wider discussion to insert context, ethics and history into the debate.<p>The point about privacy is not you, no one cares what you are doing so an individual perspective here has zero value, but building the infrastructure and ability to track what everyone in a society is doing, and preempt any threat to entrenched interests and status quo.

That way, the incentives really line up in that 1) they&#x27;re more incentivized to complete the task successfully, 2) users trust them a lot more and know that they will get their money&#x27;s worth, and 3) they develop the &quot;fixer&quot; brand, where Magic gets you what you want, and you only have to pay if it gets done.&quot;</i><p>I&#x27;ve done this business in travel (i.e. concierge travel planning, which is actually fairly high margin). What you&#x27;re suggesting is a quick route to insolvency: most leads -- at every price tier -- will ask you to do things that take a lot of your time to plan, then back out at the moment of purchase. It&#x27;s inevitable. And if you try to <i>make</i> them buy the thing you&#x27;ve planned, it&#x27;s an unhappy customer, or more time spent planning.<p>You deal with this issue by attempting to charge for your labor, in advance, at rates that make up for this cost. But then you find that your addressable market gets progressively smaller as your conversion rates go up. Eventually, if you&#x27;re lucky, you end up at a price point that allows you to work profitably in a market of &quot;interesting&quot; size. Then, it&#x27;s just a matter of getting your customer&#x27;s LTV to exceed the CAC for that market. That&#x27;s the real trick -- it often isn&#x27;t possible. Concierge services are An Existing Thing, and the costs of the business are well-known and optimized in ways that most outsiders don&#x27;t think about (e.g. package tours and operator kickbacks, which make bespoke travel planning look insanely expensive by comparison). It&#x27;s easier at the ultra-high-end than at the low end (which is why you don&#x27;t see many low-end concierge services outside of VC-funded startups), but you don&#x27;t reach those customers with AdWords. The channels that reach luxury customers know the value of the unicorn eyeballs they&#x27;re selling, and they want to get paid.<p>Most conversation in this discussion is fixated on &quot;technology&quot; solving the problem, but that&#x27;s wrong. Anyone can build up a database of customer preferences and fancy hotels in Omaha to optimize the 5% problem of &quot;how do I fulfill a request&quot;. You can even try to make fancy pants AI that will try to guess what someone likes based on their age, location and the phase of the moon. But what technology <i>can&#x27;t</i> do is make customers less flaky, and that&#x27;s the rate-limiting step of this business.",1452065873

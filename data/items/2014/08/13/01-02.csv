I think that automating the sales process, from prospecting to closing will be a vertical that&#x27;ll see huge growth over the next few years. Anything that helps companies make money faster and integrates with salespeople&#x27;s existing workflows is an obvious winner. That&#x27;s the good news, the bad news is how low the barrier to entry for this market is right now and will continue to be with the current business model. The company that becomes the leader in this will work out how to make something that is seemingly highly commoditisable (email sending and read receipts) solidly defensible so the next startup down the block can&#x27;t just undercut you on number of prospects contacted per pricing tier. I suspect the answer will have more to do with more impressive mass personalisation rather than any network effects these companies can create.

An innovative solution which solves a real pain point for customers in a way which is differentiated from competitors. This competitive advantage would preferably be defensible. Hopefully it is in a large market which has capacity for exponential growth. A detailed go to market and customer acquisition strategy is also vitally important, cash is king in startups so traction with paying customers not only buys you time, but also demonstrates to the investor you have somewhat validated and tested the idea you&#x27;re pitching.<p>It&#x27;s also important to convey all this in your deck in a manner which is compelling and concise. Clarity is vital when pitching investors so be specific and don&#x27;t fill your slides up with a bunch of boring text. Use visuals to convey concepts where you can.

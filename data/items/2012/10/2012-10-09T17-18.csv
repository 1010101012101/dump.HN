Say you expect 3TB hard drives to be $110 in 3 months and the current price is $130. You may buy a contract for $115/hd - if someone is willing to sell you that contract.<p>Typically if you're hedging a commodity for actual use, what you're trying to do is to lock in your cost and not to make money out of it. Let's look at an airline for example. The price of oil currently is $90/barrel and I think it might go up even more to $120/barrel. I buy a contract for 100 barrels of oil at $100/barrel deliverable in 3 months. Say I use 100 barrels of oil every 3 months. I now know that my fuel cost is now $10,000 for those 3 months. This then allows me to price my product based on that $10,000 assumption.<p>In the case of hard drives, I have no idea if it would be a good idea to hedge since the prices keep on dropping and the Thailand flood is not an everyday occurance and in general prices of hard drives are pretty stable and don't fluctuate like oil prices. But fundamentally, you're not trying to avoid losing money; you're trying to lock in your cost so you can price your service accordingly and not be in a bind if the price of your commodity fluctuates.",1349805584

They could add more, and make the window a bit bigger, but that subtracts directly from cargo, which is already small: just 1000 lbs.<p>The launcher has to drop Dragon basically right underneath the ISS; it approaches by raising altitude just several km. (In orbit, speeding up or slowing down means a change in altitude as well, so catching up or slowing down requires a lot more fuel.)<p>Since the second stage drops off Dragon just below and a little behind the ISS, a second burn to raise the orbit would necessarily take it past the ISS. NASA is, understandably, very cautious around the ISS. I'm a bit surprised the even allowed a secondary payload boost. It was probably on very, very tight conditions.<p>Making up for the lost engine probably got them to about the right place, but the different flight profile meant it wasn't the perfect place. Presumably it was inside Dragon's maneuver window, but outside the parameters NASA set for the secondary payload. This could happen if the second stage got too far ""ahead"" of the ISS due to a longer, lower burn, putting the second stage stack immediately below the ISS instead of below and behind it. Dragon, being in a lower (slower) orbit, can just wait a bit and get in the right position, but the booster could not proceed immediately as it would go too close to the ISS and could not wait as it is battery powered. Thus: secondary payload doesn't get its orbit.<p>Missing the secondary's orbit is unfortunate, but that is the nature of the secondary payload. You take a gamble in return for a discounted ride. It's appropriate for a prototype, as this is, and they'll probably still get their primary mission done--testing that it functions properly in orbit. Probably won't get to use it in their constellation if it works, which would have been gravy.",1349805077

I respect Mozilla's decision not to integrate NaCl, to argue that it's premature to talk about doing so while it's underspecified and coupled to Chromium, and to set criteria that it must meet before it will be on the table for further discussion.  I can understand concerns about cost and governance and an unwillingness to jump on what is perceived as a ""Google treadmill.""  None of my comment was about any of that.<p>What I can't understand is the fundamentalist reaction to the very idea of native code, the ignoring/dismissing of serious work to solve the problem of portability, the liberal use of words like ""never"" and ""non-starter,"" spread of FUD by invoking inaccurate comparisons like ActiveX (vis a vis its security model) and DLL Hell, and the spreading of misinformation.  For example, PNaCl is not, and as far as I can tell never has been, dependent on machine word size.  The link you cited doesn't apply because it is arguing against a different approach than what PNaCl actually does.<p>PNaCl works by defining a little-endian ILP32 machine as the target and fixing all important characteristics of this machine independently of the characteristics of the underlying CPU.  This abstract machine's characteristics are defined in such a way that they can efficiently be translated to native code on any modern CPU.

(We aim to demonstrate this.)<p>This is a far more reasonable and compelling story.  By all means talk up your stuff and argue that you can win in the free market of ideas.  I'm not arguing that I or anybody else should be able to dictate to developers what technology they use; on the contrary it is the Mozilla argument of ""no one gets to the machine except through our VM and our GC"" that paternalistically ties developers' hands and limits their options.",1349805007

4632914,comment,4630057,4631483,2,0,dherman,,,"> The presentation focused on what it perceived as missing features: structs (seriously?), classes, modules, syntactic sugar, macros, etc.<p>The nature of a widely-used technology is that you can't remove features, you can only add. And yet adding features causes an increase in complexity. So what to do? The answer is to add features judiciously: prefer general features that cover a wide array of use cases and can provide better ways to do things that the existing features don't do or don't do well. (But also avoid over-general features that destroy important invariants -- for example, just say no to call/cc or threads.)<p>> But the huge gaping holes in Javascript are not missing features. They are fundamental errors in the language. Things like ==, numbers as strings, eval, incorrect definitions of false, semicolon insertion, and -- heaven help us all -- improper lexical scoping.<p>ES6 -- and potentially down the road, macros -- are paving paths to fix many of these problems you mention, and other important problems besides (e.g., callback hell). Lexical scoping is partially improved with ES5's ""use strict"" and further improved with ES6 modules. Block scoping finally exists thanks to `let`. ES6's module loaders allow translation hooks to enable dialects or alternative languages to be run in-browser (which you can do with preprocessing and build steps and directly, but using them in-language streamlines the ""shift-reloadability"" development experience). Module loaders also provide a saner eval, which allows you to completely sandbox the evaluated code. Macros could even allow rebinding operators like `==` to have cleaned-up semantics. We intend to try this out with sweet.js, building something like ""restrict mode"" (<a href=""http://restrictmode.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://restrictmode.org</a>) as a module you can import.<p>Dave",1349804604

I didn't realize it at the time, but choosing a spouse to share a lot of the work-life with you is really important.  We probably don't spend as much time together as other couples, but it works well, because we share the same kind of life.  He works at a startup, and I have LaunchBit.  So on a given weekend, we might spend time ""together"" by working on our respective work at his office.  And our hours are roughly the same, which makes it easy to work a 10-12 hour day, because no one is sitting around waiting for the other to come home.  I think most people would say that this isn't very balanced at all -- we're mostly working.  But, it is balanced because expectations are set and met on both sides.<p>Now, to your question about wishing that you had more time to pursue other hobbies and whatnot.  If that's what you need, then I think that's perfectly fine too as long as everyone else on your startup team is onboard with that: co-founders, employees, investors.",1349802044

4632657,comment,4632424,4632424,16,0,llambda,,,"First off it seems like there is a strange, specious simile the OP is trying to draw between a director doing some camerawork (note: Kubrick in that particular interview cited is only speaking of /handheld/ camerawork specifically because it's difficult to communicate the framing and such) themselves and an individual being able to do everything (within the scope of some discipline) themselves. Let's clear something up right now: directors who do some or all of their own camerawork are NOT tantamount to directors making a film by themselves. There is so much more that goes into making a film besides the raw camerawork. Even your average Joe will know this by proxy as big events like the Academy Awards highlight the complexity of big Hollywood productions and the many roles that individuals have mastered. Directors, e.g. Lars von Trier, will sometimes oscillate between doing all camerawork themselves and none of it. (In Trier's case he even experimented with allowing a computer program to compose shots in a completely automated way!) However none of this backs up the apparent assumption that this is equivalent to making the film wholly yourself.<p>That said I think this is a pretty weak and misleading analogy! We can give the OP a break here and say, ""Sure I know what you're getting at."" However, if you really want to get a strong point across, use a better analogy.<p>Finally, let me dwell on one passage in the posting that I find troubling:<p>> Lately it has started to feel like our society respects vision more than the actual craft of execution.<p>What is going through the OP's mind here? Execution is definitely the only thing that has ever mattered.",1349802007

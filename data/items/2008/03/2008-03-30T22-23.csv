150486,comment,149052,149366,0,0,mejohnsn,,,"You ask, ""why would you put extra layers on it, which will have to be unwrapped to get to the inner logic?"".<p>There are two possible reasons:<p>1) you know your audience is not that logical to begin with, and need to be lured by illogical appeals to emotions etc.<p>2) you know they could be persuaded by logical argument, but need help summoning up the will to persist in following it. In that case, you mix logic with entertainment and exhortation. But you must mix carefully, to keep from falling into the trap of merely luring by illogical appeals (or even seeming to do this). Unfortunately, few have the patience for this, so many take the easy way, (merely luring).<p>Plato took course 2) often in his dialogs. Augustine did the same in both sermons and treatises. Aristotle never did, at least not in his surviving works (his dialogs are lost).",1206917890

In this case, you begun this thread by referring to the ""vast amount of good"" that ""sites like"" Torrentspy do.<p>Your other argument seems to be that we shouldn't concern ourselves with the costs inflicted by torrent sites, because they are small --- ""not even half of the downloads"" directly rob producers of revenue. I don't care to chase that argument down. If you believe your argument is persuasive, I have good news for you: you needn't bother paying your taxes, either. The marginal cost to the government of losing Bruce Lewis' tax revenue is very nearly zero. In fact, if everyone <i>like</i> you stopped paying taxes, we'd be no worse off. Under your argument's rubric, I can see no reason for us to trouble ourselves with the task of collecting taxes from Scheme web developers at all.",1206917632

In that case, I _still_ have to say this is just a more thanaverage level of sophistication for a form of solipsism. But I cannot see it any other way than as solipsism.<p>That alone is reason enough to reject it. But here is another reason: his point about other goals is irrelevant. Why? Because though yes, we ""mere humans"" have other goals, at least _some_ of the time, those other goals require that we get to the truth of some matter. And those are precisely the fields of endeavor where rational argumentation still has some influence in our confused and irrational society.<p>That said, we _do_ have to take great care: the dishonest dissemblers who strive so hard to deceive us are _legion_, the honest reasoners who wish to persuade us of the truth by legitimate means are rare gems.

150458,comment,149052,149052,0,0,mejohnsn,,,"Speaking of disgreeing, I found a lot to disagree with in this article. But since I see many of my objections have already been stated by others adding comments, I will restrict myself to a few comments:<p>1) I have been surprised at what a _variety_ of definitions I have found the for terms PG uses to describe fallacies. People do _not_ agree on the definition for, say, ""ad hominem"". See, for example, the differing definitions on the following sites, which purport to give definitions for the major fallacies:<p>a) <a href=""http://theautonomist.com/aaphp/permanent/fallacies.php#adhom"" rel=""nofollow"">http://theautonomist.com/aaphp/permanent/fallacies.php#adhom</a><p>Ad hominem fallacy - (against the man). Ad hominem is the attempt to impugn an argument by attacking the arguer's character, motives, personality, intentions, or qualifications.
b) <a href=""http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/mathew/logic.html#hominem"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/mathew/logic.html#hom...</a>, which gives not only a very different definition, but a much wordier one.
c) <a href=""http://www.galilean-library.org/manuscript.php?postid=43794"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.galilean-library.org/manuscript.php?postid=43794</a><p>No two give the same definition!<p>2) That "" u r a fag"" is NOT equivalent to "" The author is a self-important dilettante."" has already been mentioned by others, and it hardly requires more substantiation.<p>3) I am by no means convinced that the proposed hierarchy of disagreement even sets an ""upper bound"". There is too much overlap, the boundaries are vague (as has already been pointed out by others), and it is much, _much_ too easy to make your argument _look_ like DH6, when it is really nothing like it.<p>Surely this is a common experience. I have often seen some public speaker make a rousing speech to encourage people to do something, yet the _entire_ speech had only either exhortation or fallacious arguments, yet his intended audience swallowed it whole, taking it for a DH6 level refutation.<p>4) Finally, it is too easy to sink to a low level of non-argument, lower than even DH1, without fitting into any of these categories.

1713045,comment,1712493,1712832,0,0,ajdecon,,,"Edit: re-reading the nlavezzo's comment, it really isn't as dismissive as I had initially read it, and the reply below is more because this topic really touches a nerve for me.  I'm leaving it here because I don't want it un-said, but I don't want to target someone who doesn't deserve it. Sorry.<p>This encompasses a lot of my reaction when I first read this article a few years back, and before I spent some time volunteering with charities in the US.  I was, frankly, angry.  Most of the time, being poor in the US is not a matter of sheer survival (except for health care), but simply a very deep hole which is hard to climb out of.  But possible, right? So why not just do it?<p>But these days, this reaction is what really angers me.  It's still a fucking deep hole. And the psychological effect of being raised in these circumstances is what doesn't get acknowledged a lot. A lot of the time you have to be taught that it's even <i>possible</i> to dig out of it, let alone how.  This is especially true if you were raised in poverty, by parents who were also raised in poverty, in a place where the schools are a joke and you don't know <i>anyone</i> who has been successful.  It's very easy to simply despair in these conditions, and not even realize it might be possible for things to change, because as far as you know it's not.  And while the rare person might be able to summon the willpower to escape this, I'd like to know how many people truly think they could if they had never even seen what success looked like, except on TV.<p>Hell, I was raised in an area which was simply rural middle class, not poor by any definition; and almost no one there could imagine that good schools, good health care, or a substantially better life were in reach.  The idea of attending any private university, let alone an Ivy, was a joke.  And we were luckier than 99% of the world, and knew it!  For some... I simply can't imagine.<p>The dismissive attitude exhibited in so many tech forums towards the poor is just infuriating, both in the ""lazy poor"" category and the ""it's not as bad as elsewhere!"" type.  If you're in that situation, it doesn't matter that there's someone out there worse-off.  What does matter is if you were brought up to think success isn't possible, you despair of making anything better, and you've lost hope.  I won't argue back and forth about ""handouts"" because a lot of the time that's used to be dismissive too.  But making it known that it's actually possible to have a better life--that is what needs to be done.<p>(Tangentially, it's worth pointing out that Scalzi acknowledges the difference between being poor in the US and in the Third World, as in his followup post here: <a href=""http://whatever.scalzi.com/2005/09/04/quick-followups/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://whatever.scalzi.com/2005/09/04/quick-followups/</a> .)",1285084576

This is blatantly conflating trades with education.<p>Exactly the author's point: We need to stop pushing all kids into college when some of them really should be pursuing tradeschools or associates degrees focused narrowly on these middle-wage skilled jobs.<p>>> It is in this respect that the prevailing “college for all” philosophy is most misguided...

Using almost the same protocol in both servers we are actually measuring the internals.<p>Anyway your reasoning can be applied the other way around.

There are the dangers of a cushy job, but one that you need for the money.<p>All in all, it sounds remarkably similar to the software world.

With higher education, you get out of it what you put in.  The technical schools aren't much better.  If you're going just for the certification/degree, you'd better be damned sure that the increased debt you take out is going to be offset by increased earning potential.  Often, that's not the case.<p>I've been through two rounds of post-secondary education, earning a bachelor's degree and a law degree.  I can say without hesitation that I wasted my time with the bachelor's degree.  Not because the school was bad, but because the effort I put in wasn't proportionate to the tuition paid.  Law school was just the opposite.  It hasn't necessarily increased my earnings (I co-founded a technology services company before law school and probably made more money at that) but I expect the law degree to pay out over a longer period of time.  Even if I were to completely abandon the practice of law, what I learned will pay dividends in any number of fields.<p>To say that someone can simply engage in a trade and make money doesn't reflect the full value of an education.  A dedicated student may study in one field and wind up working in another.  But the thought process and skills they obtain through their education give them a higher probability of success in whatever field they may choose.<p>The flip side is that an unmotivated student who drops out of college three years in hasn't gained anything but debt.<p>The trick is figuring out your motivations <i>before</i> starting school.",1285083635

The odds that some one breaks goes up a fair bit. Let me put it another way. The single branch is the simplest way to write code. The reason that so many places don't do it isn't because they like to just make things complicated, its because they've all had things go bad with the other system.</i><p>How many people do you think Google has checking code in?  I'm not allowed to tell you, but I'm curious what you think it is.<p>Google has a lot of people who have a lot of experience in lots of companies of all sizes.  We didn't settle on our current system out of ignorance of how other large projects work.  But I'll completely agree that if you try to naively scale up smaller development processes with one branch, you'll fall over unless you address a bunch of other problems.  Most people at Google believe that we have done so.<p><i>With Google, my prediction is that Android/Chrome will eventually move to a system where there are branches for certain parts of the product. I think the rest of Google can probably work out of a single branch.</i><p>My understanding is that Android and Chrome are already both are in separate repositories so that they can interact better with outside groups.  (Both are open source projects with outside developers.)  Given that Android is in git, I am sure that it has a ton of branches.<p>That said, the rest of Google is a much more complex product which is under very rapid development.",1285083151

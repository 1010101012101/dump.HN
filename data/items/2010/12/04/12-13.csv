It got so crazy that companies got into the IPO-business, you could drop anything on the public markets (it seemed) and watch the price skyrocket.<p>This is all private investing, not public offers. And it's a big difference between what a bunch of rich guys do with their extra money than what grandma does with her retirement fund. It's also different from the housing bubble, which involved huge swaths of public money and touched anybody with a mortgage. If you're a big believer in free markets (I am) then this is exactly what rich guys are supposed to be doing -- gambling their money on a horde of young bucks with crazy ideas to change the world (or little parts of it). I'd also point out that startups today are much sounder financially than they were back in 2000. So while it may be a bubble, it's a bubble we can easily live with. We could use more bubbling, actually.",1291466747

They're all using CoreData (which is a simplified cut-down version of WebObject's EOF); it should be a simple matter just to sync to a Mac app, let alone to a web site.<p>Instead, devs have to learn three different stacks and join them all up manually.

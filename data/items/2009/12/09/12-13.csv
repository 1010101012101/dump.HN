Instead, it's a native Linux app that has been ported using WineLib, which reimplements a lot of the Windows API, but compiled to Linux. Instead of replacing API calls with the Linux equivalents, there's just an additional layer that redirect calls or implements them.<p>Wine and WineLib are different things.",1260363581

This method, described as psychedelic therapy, attempts to induce a mystical-religious experience through the shock effects of LSD. This experience can then serve as a starting point for a restructuring and curing of the patient's personality in the accompanying psychotherapeutic treatment. The term psychedelic, which can be translated as ""mind-manifesting"" or ""mind-expanding,"" was introduced by Humphry Osmond, a pioneer of LSD research in the United States.''[1]<p>Read the rest of the reference, you'll find why/how LSD became associated with the counter-culture, and then became illegal because of that. My take is that LSD, when administered responsibly, can lead to major positive life changes for those in need.<p>It is a pity that it is illegal, which only increases the risk of abuse/work dosage/mixing with other stuff, but perhaps in a more civilized age...<p>[1] Hofmann, Albert; LSD: My Problem Child; url -><a href=""http://www.psychedelic-library.org/child4.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.psychedelic-library.org/child4.htm</a>",1260363431

985704,comment,985638,985698,0,0,TriinT,,,"I speculate that the price is that high because they can afford to charge that much. A cargo ship can take only 12 passengers at most... and there seem to be a few 1000s of people who are really into this kind of traveling. Suppy & demand is the most likely explanation for such high prices.<p>For example, the following company charges $2,500 for a 20-day voyage from Long Beach to Shanghai:<p><a href=""http://www.freighterworld.com/places/fareast.html#LaeiszCAX"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.freighterworld.com/places/fareast.html#LaeiszCAX</a><p>If the flight ticket is approx. $1,000 and 20 days of rent in LA are at least $500, then one is paying a $1,000 premium for the experience, which does not sound <i>too</i> much if one does it only once.

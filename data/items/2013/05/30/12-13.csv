As someone who has made a career out of Java and made over a million dollars doing it, I really dont see Java as a platform anymore.<p>I love the integration, and the support that you get with a dead language because its been around so long.<p>But Java <i>is</i> dead.  Has been for a long time.<p>Im typing this on a desktop with 32GB of ram.  Java cant use even that small sum of cheap ram without huge GC pauses, and it never will.<p>Java has tons of frameworks, some of the very good, but most of them are not.  And Java never delivered on its promises and now we are seeing tons of languages port themselves to what is a <i>great</i> VM for JIT compilation, but completely unusable in real world use.<p>The JVM cant even use 32GB of ram efficiently, and yet we can buy servers with 256GB of ram for 5K.<p>Java has made a fortune for me, but not in the way it should have.  Java will not survive the next 10 years.  Get off the platform unless you want to do maintenance.",1369918779

5791975,comment,5791489,5791948,11,0,DrJokepu,,,"The typical problem with what you're advocating is that in an enterprise environment typically your application is communicating with a number of external data sources that already make a bunch of assumptions about data, whether they're reasonable assumptions or not, and they typically expect that you'll be able to return them their data at the same level of granularity as they've provided it to you. E.g. if your client's 70s COBOL application gives you a list of their customers with addresses including a postcode field and then your application filters that or something and sends back a second list, it won't be acceptable to give them back addresses with the postcode simply concatenated into a text field with the other parts of the address.<p>The correct way to handle this is to be able to dynamically accept and store arbitrary granularity of data (and be able to translate that into a single text field at runtime if needed).",1369915731

If they could get the same salary working for 5 hours a day, they would, and if they could get by, pay for food and rent and stuff for less salary and/or without working they would to.

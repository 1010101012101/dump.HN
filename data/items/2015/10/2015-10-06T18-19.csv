Last I checked, you can&#x27;t run a Kinect very well on a $9 ARM chip. Based on graphics we&#x27;ve seen in demos I doubt the system hardware is anything less than we see in an Xbox One, but it&#x27;s definitely not less than what we see on a Surface Pro, form factor for form factor.<p>It&#x27;s possible that they are trying to weed out early adopters with a high cost, but with entire new hardware that&#x27;s not been mass produced to date (the holographic display, the proprietary holographic processing unit) it certainly seems like this is probably more a reflection of actual production costs today. It&#x27;s certainly long been a tradition of console game systems that the early development machines are an order of magnitude (as much as even 100x, historically) more expensive than the final retail hardware. (Which also historically has been a profit center for some console generations when they were charging the same development box costs long after the retail cost margin drops.) It&#x27;s very much a case that I think the only real comparison is to the Xbox One and we don&#x27;t have a lot of data on that as Xbox One never sold dev kits to the public, that&#x27;s certainly something new with the Developer Edition of the HoloLens.<p>Also, for what it&#x27;s worth I&#x27;ve not heard any reports of &quot;tracking lag&quot; (in fact just the opposite from articles I&#x27;ve followed to date, that the HoloLens seems to have &quot;tracking magic&quot;) and I&#x27;m willing to believe that the adjustments of the device&#x27;s FOV are as much for safety reasons as anything else (we humans use our peripheral vision for a lot of things when navigating the real world). Certainly the same journalists complaining about the FOV have also stated that they&#x27;ve experienced different FOV in different demos.",1444157855

And for those of us who didn&#x27;t grow up with the UNIX shell to understand the reasons why things were kept so short, it&#x27;s a bit easier to digest. (I do appreciate why bash is so short and succulent. =)<p>But really, taking the above into consideration, the might in powershell comes not from the terms used, in my opinion, but how it works on things. With grep for example, you&#x27;re parsing a file. If say, you wanted to filter on that more, you&#x27;d be using awk to pick out parts of the text.<p>In Powershell, everything&#x27;s an object. Everything&#x27;s already an object, you don&#x27;t need to pick the file apart to isolate the date, you just filter on the date object. It&#x27;s got a data type.<p>That makes it really powerful, in my opinion.<p>(Example largely pulled from &quot;Windows Powershell in Action&quot;.

The majority of cyber security tools out there focus on the IT department, adding complexity, expensive hardware, and lengthy sales cycles. We built Crypteron to make mission-critical security simple by empowering developers to build secure, regulatory compliant applications in the cloud. It takes minutes to add our security platform into your .NET or Java applications and save months of development time. With just a few lines of code, all sensitive data is automatically secured with military-grade AES encryption before it ever leaves the application and is automatically decrypted on the way back. This reduces the circle of trust to just the application itself and makes compliance, including HIPAA and PCI, in the public or hybrid cloud possible All SQL and NoSQL data stores are supported as well files and file streams. We recognize that most developers aren&#x27;t security experts and we believe that they should spend their valuable time focusing on what makes their applications unique without having to lose sleep over becoming the next data breach headline.",1444157571

While I hate the almost singular choice for OsX .. both for Windows and Android I think there is just too many price points and when you try to reduce by 5-10-20 dollar you skip things that seems not so essentially but the degradation in experience is much more than the money saved.<p>What I really hope from this is that it shows the OEM that there are enough interest in quality product and also let them know what are some of the things that people really care about like the build quality, nice keyboard/touchpad etc. Beyond this particular laptop my real wish is that it motivates and gives confidence to the windows OEM.

It is a shared ledger.  Gold is a shared ledger.  Bitcoin and all crypto-currencies are a shared ledger.  The currency of a country is a shared ledger (albeit with more infrastructure and less guarantee of the total).  So &#x27;coloring&#x27; is extending the idea that money is physical into a place where it doesn&#x27;t work.  The Russian oligarchs didn&#x27;t create the money they have, they had it transferred to them by others.  Maybe they forced citizens by  violence, but then again, maybe they sold oil and natural gas to China.  Who is &#x27;guilty&#x27; now and of what?<p>The second fallacy plays in to the first. Money is not law. Building law into money has been an excessively dangerous idea throughout history that to no one&#x27;s surprise favors those who create and enforce the laws.  Often those people are the ones with the most money. It isn&#x27;t a leap to see that this is a cycle that reinforces itself.",1444157491

I think the problem is different, though. So much wisdom and so many capabilities are in papers, sometimes software, created in academia. However, nobody knows they exist. Coursework isn&#x27;t the reason. The reason seems to be two-fold: (a) the main sources for all of it are pay-walled ACM and IEEE that professionals never use; (b) the non-paywalled links are scattered across the web in University sites instead of one or more central, organized sources for such information. These problems <i>must</i> be solved somehow because the opportunity cost is gigantic.<p>I try to get this info to people by pulling batches of papers, skimming them, finding the worthwhile stuff, and mentioning it in online forums or to specific people in projects. I have over 10,000 papers in my collection from ACM/IEEE that were organized at some point (sighs). Anyway, when a topic comes up, I can just search them and (surprise!) many modern problems have already been solved. People just aren&#x27;t applying the solutions when they know about them and more often just don&#x27;t know about them.<p>So, the second one was my idea. A resource, crowd or taxpayer-funded, that&#x27;s essentially an organized encyclopedia of papers and software developed in academia pertitent to aspects of software development. It would start as a manual effort that pulls in the links and paper that represent the best of most topics. As it got buy-in, the professors might have their students categorize and submit their own stuff. I thought an invite-only forum for serendipidous discussion among people that know their shit (esp researchers, professors, industry vets) could also get ideas across. Might be a fee for all of this charged to users, universities, someone that&#x27;s way cheaper than ACM/IEEE. Basically, enough to cover the servers, bandwidth, and at least one employee.<p>Ran it by Epstein at NSF. He thought it was a nice idea but wisely warned it might not take off at all without buy-in ahead of time. The buy-in would have to come from a ton of places, too. So, bootstrapping that might be tricky. Even worse, many people I talked to in academia indicate the people and organizations on that side don&#x27;t care about practical things at all. The ones that do are an exception and the norm actually filters out that stuff in favor of publishing/citations.<p>Well, we could hit it from the other side. Closest thing I&#x27;ve seen from industry was Dr Dobbs with articles on Cleanroom, Design-by-Contract, etc. Many professionals read that and could get exposed to cutting-edge via practical treatments from a trusted source. Additionally, the likes of Microsoft, IBM, Google, and Facebook do the cutting-edge academia and practical stuff simultaneously while publishing some and deploying others. This brings attention to it. Some results at these companies got widely deployed and are standard fare today.<p>So, I&#x27;d say the easiest route is a hybrid between companies and the nonprofit concept. Anyone wanting to try it can look at the kind of stuff companies are working on. Package up the cutting-edge stuff for those things to make it the first deliverable of the site. Add in plenty of IT and INFOSEC stuff on top of that which has immediate value for them. Get those companies as members to sponsor the initial development. Simultaneously, try to get University groups on the bandwagon who operate in key areas of IT or INFOSEC where the research results need attention. For big ones, maybe let them pay to have a dedicate person doing nothing but pulling in and curating their research as a brand boost for them. The site/service should grow in both usage and material as businesses pull on it for info while Universities push theirs into it.<p>Outside an effort like this, I&#x27;m not sure how else we&#x27;re going to bridge the gap between academia and industry in a major way.",1444156992

A lot of the projects that do, tend to focus on applying methodologies more rigorously than the actual goal of the software.  I&#x27;ve seen problems with both.<p>I think what some people miss about having a formal methodology is that a lot of time can end up being wasted addressing the same types of issues (design problems, bugs, re-implementing things, multiple requirements changes, etc...).  The same can actually be true with applying methodologies too rigorously though.<p>The most effective software development I&#x27;ve seen tends to be where the culture values both quality and time spent.  If something can improve quality and reduce the amount of time spent on boring tasks, it generally doesn&#x27;t take much convincing there.<p>I think in a lot of ways, a lack of focus on software engineering isn&#x27;t necessarily an academic problem.

10341240,comment,10335645,10336739,0,0,swang,,,"To clarify, you don&#x27;t just pick high variance players.<p>You _must_ pick some people that are high-cost high-reward types. The superstars that will almost always get their lion&#x27;s share of points. You cannot win a tournament just by picking high variance players, or it would be extremely hard to do so. You also have a salary cap so you can&#x27;t just pick 5 superstar players. The higher their perceived worth, the higher they cost to &quot;buy&quot; them.<p>So the main point you can differentiate yourself from other players is to find &quot;sleeper&quot; picks. These are players that are OK but not GREAT but if given a proper matchup, could do very well.<p>For example, you may pick the 2nd best receiver on a team hoping he has a great day because the opposing defense is known to double team the offense&#x27;s best receiver. This may give the 2nd best receiver more opportunities for catching the ball for yardage/touchdowns.<p>BUT the thing is, this happens a lot. So you know maybe 4 games where this will happen. But you don&#x27;t know the percentage picked of each player. Just like in March Madness brackets where picking all chalk (the favorites) to win is a bad strategy because almost everyone else is doing it and at best/worst you will tie, it is to your advantage to bet on players that you think _may_ have a chance, but are picked the least from the pool.<p>So the advantage this employee got, was he knew how often each player was picked on DraftKings, so given his basic assumptions he just applied those percentages to FanDuel. He knew player X had a good matchup, but _no_ one was picking him. So he plays multiple lineups with player X, buying him up so if he has a good day the employee will win big.<p>But he also places wagers on player Y, player Y has been picked more than player X, but still enough where the employee can get a good return, so he places a couple of lineups with player Y in it (even combining with player X hoping they both have big games). Buying some lineups with player Y also hedges your bet in case player X doesn&#x27;t do well. This is probably what you are curious about. You don&#x27;t pick only player X hoping he does have a great game. You hedge by buying more lineups with him in it, but supplement that with other lineups and picks that you think are +EV.<p>So the advantage is you know who hasn&#x27;t been picked a lot. And as you start buying players you have to start spending more &quot;efficiently.&quot; If you know player Z has only been bought 10% of the time but you know he has a high likelihood of a big game, you will pick player Z more in your lineups than other lower priced players because his returns will be good.",1444156538

The individual can look at it, correct it, and take it back.<p>This isn&#x27;t a problem if you&#x27;re not a scumbag.  If you&#x27;re selling your customer list for marketing purposes, or using data you collect about users for marketing purposes, you have a problem.<p>The EU requires explicit consent for such things. A contract of adhesion EULA is <i>not</i> enough.  Exceptions to data privacy must be opt-in, not opt-out.<p>Passing data about persons on to another party can cause serious liability.  You have to know where the data went, exactly who has it, and be able to delete it even if it&#x27;s now in the hands of another party.<p>This is EU-wide, and registration with one national data controller (a Government agency which checks for privacy violations) in the EU is usually sufficient. Here&#x27;s a set of guidelines from the European trade association for online marketing.[2]<p>The biggest practical implication here is that any data you collect and share about individuals must remain within your reach, because you&#x27;re responsible for correcting it, blocking it, or deleting it.

Those opinions aren&#x27;t baseless, though. Money entitles you to a reward from society, no matter how you got the money. Even if some people know you did terrible things to get it, you only have to find one person willing to reward you. The store that sells things to that person is rewarding them for rewarding you for doing terrible things. We&#x27;re all complicit in rewarding people for terrible things because our money makes us powerless.<p>We want the good part of money: it allows us to engage in economic games of transferable utility, so we don&#x27;t have to barter. But it&#x27;d also be nice to prevent the bad parts as well. Our current solution is regulation, so the profitable strategy becomes innovating new ways to profit at the public&#x27;s expense before regulations are in place.<p>We should just stop rewarding people for doing things that harm the public. If you make money by polluting, we should stop rewarding you. If you make money by tricking people into taking out loans they can&#x27;t afford, we should stop rewarding you. We know who these people are, but as individuals, we have no way to stop rewarding them. We need a money that lets us do that.<p>Instead of today&#x27;s currencies, let&#x27;s just explicitly model our spending. When I buy a bottle of water from a store, let&#x27;s create a database record where I assert that the store rewarded me with $1 of stuff. Let&#x27;s also connect that to the justification for the reward: either I did some work for someone else, or the store is letting me owe them a dollar. Instead of using a traditional private database, let&#x27;s put these records in a public, shared database on a blockchain.<p>This gives individuals the information to decide whose rewards they want to be complicit in. If you&#x27;ve done terrible things, I don&#x27;t want to reward people for rewarding you. If you&#x27;re impoverished and don&#x27;t have a way to do valuable things for other people, I want to reward people who reward you anyway.<p>This is merit capitalism.<p><a href=""http://meritcapitalism.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://meritcapitalism.com/</a>",1444154810

10340946,comment,10339175,10340353,0,0,ntucker,,,"I&#x27;ve been using something similar of my own making, and I&#x27;ve been meaning to clean it up and publish it at some point.  Since I have enough side projects going that I have no idea when that will be, I&#x27;ll share a couple features of mine that I think make it unique and which I think should be incorporated into the others.<p>The general concept I stole from somewhere else -- you&#x27;ve got a stored list of sites and when you type your master password in a field, each site in the list then gets a &quot;copy password&quot; button based on the site name + master password.  But this isn&#x27;t quite flexible enough for general use, so I added some features:<p>First, each site has a &#x27;version&#x27; field which becomes just another piece of data input to the hash.  This makes it so you can rotate passwords on a particular site without changing your master password: increment this number and you get a whole new password.<p>Second, each site has a password &#x27;scheme&#x27; which allows for disparate password requirements on different sites.  The underlying generation algorithm is the same, but rather than converting the hash output to a base64 number and using it directly, the hash output is used to deterministically select characters based on the rule set.  Roughly, each scheme has an arbitrary number of character &quot;classes&quot; that may be included (e.g. &quot;numbers&quot;, &quot;letters&quot;, and &quot;symbols&quot;) and each scheme may specify a minimum number of characters from each class (a typical rule being that that min=1 for numbers and symbols).  So the class-specific minimums are satisfied, then the rest of the characters are selected from all classes equally, then a few more bytes of hash are consumed to deterministically change the order of the selected chars (otherwise you&#x27;d always end up with your minimum two special characters at the front, for example, which technically weakens the password).  Each site also can have a distinct password length setting.  Currently I only have three or four different &quot;schemes&quot; defined and haven&#x27;t had the need to add one in a while so they&#x27;re all hardcoded, but one could easily imagine having a &quot;password scheme editor&quot; which lets you define new ones with a few primitive rule types.<p>And third, each site has a &quot;last changed&quot; date which helps me keep on top of which site passwords haven&#x27;t been rotated in a while.  If you change your master password every time you need to roll one site&#x27;s password, this probably isn&#x27;t an issue for you, but I definitely prefer to avoid the ritual of changing passwords on every site I use at once.<p>My impetus for all the password scheme complexity is that I found that more straightforward password generators simply don&#x27;t work on all sites, and I hated having exceptions.  The site where I pay my electric bill, for example, doesn&#x27;t allow exclamation points in passwords, and they must be between 6 and 8 characters.  Lame to be sure, but I really have no choice but to go along, so my password generator must too.<p>All that said about my password generator, I think this is a fundamentally different approach to the problem and I think the cbcrypt approach is ultimately more interesting if we can get it incorporated into browsers.  I&#x27;ve long thought we should expose some sort of modified SSH-agent functionality to the browser JS API so sites could do public key auth for login (with the appropriate user prompting, of course -- just allowing websites unfettered access to your SSH agent would obviously be a terrible idea).",1444154528

There&#x27;s no advantage when there&#x27;s no return.<p>For years now people have been alleging that the Fed via the FOMC and other mechanisms has been propping up the treasury market by buying them directly... an effective strategy to keep interest rates low, which will work really well... until it doesn&#x27;t.<p>When the market signals are distorted to such a degree, the damage to the economy is cumulative.

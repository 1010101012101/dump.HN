It is not surprising that the one or other vendor is lagging behind, but why shouldn't they be able to catch up? So what is bad about a new IE with faster JS?",1258628277

950034,comment,949689,949905,0,0,quant18,,,"I fail to see the slippery slope. The whole point of teaching your kid a language, or a set of manners, or religious rituals, or whatever, is to enable him to participate in a community. Raising your child into a fangroup organised around a violent species from a television show is qualitatively different from raising him into a real world minority community with an actual cultural and social life.<p>The ""Klingon community"" has no system of helping its members to make friends or find mates, no useful information about the real world, no ""payload"" of beneficial values to inculcate in its members (as PG put it in ""Lies we tell kids""), no inspirational works of art produced by people it recognises as intellectual forebears, etc. That makes it objectively inferior to pretty much any ""involuntary"" (religious/ethnic/geographical) community no matter how small, and even most ""voluntary"" communities (e.g. hackers).",1258627319

But IE is so far behind it's genuinely slowing the development of the internet and it really looks like IE9.x will continue this trend.<p>Forget the rendering differences (for which you can argue there are legacy issues that MS should care about) the pure speed of JS in the various IE's REALLY hurts the internet. Even a moderately complex Google maps mash up requires serious thought on IE as it's just SO slow.",1258626130

950016,comment,949790,949790,0,0,yardie,,,"After reading the article I'm still torn on where to stand. School systems are under siege from parents and bureaucrats and the teachers are caught in the middle. What is the optimal amount of homework? Who benefits from rote work? If your a professor or college educated, chances are your children are in a better position, intellectually, than someone that never graduated highschool. Rote work probably won't for your kids, but might be necessary to someone else's kid. Most schools don't make a delineation between the have/have nots. So giving someone more work, and others less would create a different scandal.<p>I applaud Dr. Cockshutt's involvement with her kids work but there are a lot more parents that are only concerned about the reports that come at the end of the semester. Paying no attention to what's going on, currently. These are the majority of parents. But really, it's about the teachers covering their ass. That way when some parent pleads ignorance about their kid failing teacher can point to every paper that was signed by said parent.",1258625648

I know a lot of girls who are sick of that game.<p>As a result, you get a lot of guys who aren't attractive enough to pick up random chicks at bars and you get a lot of women who are sick of being picked up by the types of guys that make a sport out of picking up random chicks at bars. Those types of girls tend to be attractive. That's not to say that everyone in online dating services falls into one of these two buckets, but that is why you see such weird skews in the data.",1258624912

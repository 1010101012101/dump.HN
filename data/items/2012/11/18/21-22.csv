4801836,comment,4801226,4801773,3,0,Tichy,,,"Well somebody had to be the first, though? And if it is just about seeing famous people in the media, why not get over yourself and admire somebody who has a different race or gender than you and follow in their steps?<p>I suppose it is more likely to be exposed to it if you are in the right neighborhood, although I don't want to invoke reverse stereotypes? Like I could say ""in other neighborhoods people would perhaps be more likely to play basketball than to code"", but that seems stupid and also racist?<p>Although I wonder about Playstation reach across communities?<p>At least white girls would seem to have the same odds for being friends with a white male nerd as other white boys, though? So perhaps they were much less likely to admire the nerd, which again was sort of the point I was making, I guess.<p>Don't know much about interracial friendships, where I grew up (Europe) there were not many non-white people when I was young.<p>Again, I am not denying that there might be statistical reasons why some people are more likely to be exposed to computers than others. From that it is a far step to call for affirmative action, though, because over time, those uneven starting points should fade away - at least when we talk about coding.<p>Also, it is nice to worry about, but I have to ask, why should I personally (as an example) have to worry about some kid somewhere else getting into programming? What if I am busy enough with my own problems? I think it is great that some people care about such things and take steps (establish special courses, conferences, advertisements, sponsorships and what not), but I don't think it should be expected from everyone.",1353275926

4801810,comment,4801226,4801765,2,0,Tichy,,,"I am not an expert on all the issues involved - who is? I think a lot of those studies are quite interesting and might not always say what they seem to say. I only skimmed a bit, for starters, your study seems to be from 1991 (or the women were interviewed up to 1991). Then I only glanced one text snippet where a man says ""perhaps because it is so rare for a man to go into that profession, they think I am so special and think more or me"". Note that your study is about men in typically female professions. For all I know, the reverse could be true for women in typically male professions. From my own anecdotal experience I think women in IT would get preferred treatment most of the time. Also (anecdote again), we actually chose the kindergarden for our son because they have a male kindergardener in it (I guess that makes me officially sexist), so I confirm the study...<p>Another study that made the rounds recently showed that even women seem to prefer to hire men over women. Sadly it didn't explore possible reasons, and references to motherhood diminishing ""work value""  were dismissed out of hand.<p>Sorry, no time to watch a movie.<p>Also, I agree that gender issues are complicated, but not necessarily that women get the worse cards. Men and women both face their challenges. Just an example, I happen to think that it is rather cruel that men are automatically expected to work while women raise their kids - it deprives men of one of the most joyful aspects of life. Also, men tend to die 10 years earlier than women on average. Just genes? Or perhaps more pressure and stress?<p>But that is not the main issue for me. I have to say that personally, I have little patience for the woes of employment. That is, I really don't care who gets promoted to what. At least in IT, if you don't like other companies, you can start your own. And 50% of the world are women (more, in fact), so even if men don't want to deal with you (which I doubt), there should be plenty of customers. (That's of course all over simplified...).<p>I don't doubt that there is inequality, but I think there are plenty of ways around it, that are open to everyone.",1353275354

We already have non-white people in top positions (both in the industry and in academia), so there's no lack of inspiration, but it takes time for those who have inspired to make their way through school and immigration. Right now there are multitudes of Indian and Chinese students in American universities: in a few years you'll see them at conferences. And that is already going to happen: they're certainly not going to drop out of their degrees and go home because some Brits were not diverse enough with their conference in Manchester.<p>2) From what I've seen, many of those students are more interested in enterprise or research applications than in doing web development with Ruby, so you might see them at slightly different conferences.<p>3) This particular conference was in the UK, not in America or in India or in China or in France.

Maybe they should have a pre-screening area for screening people who want to go into the screening line to make sure they're not going to do any terrorism!</i><p>The thing is, an attack in a queue could happen anywhere, not just an airport. But the effects are highly localized. Part of what makes plane bombs extra-scary is that they could go off anywhere, so not only does the plane blow up, but it falls out of the sky and lands on people. That's more terrifying than a bomb explosion in a fixed location, plus it impacts all other travel arteries, giving the travel network in question the equivalent of a heart attack. A bomb in the air causes a <i>lot</i> more problems than one on the ground.<p>So of course it serves a function, however badly it does so. They overstepped in this case, but I don't have that much sympathy for the artist. He knew quite well that what he was doing looked like a dry run for a bombing; I'll warrant he just didn't expect to actually get arrested.",1353274756

4801775,comment,4801226,4801390,17,0,Camillo,,,"Nice blaming of the victim, buddy. It seems that you are coming from a very loaded position here.<p>It's one thing to say ""you must not discriminate because of race or sex"". That's racism and sexism and we all find it abhorrent (or at least, I would hope so from HN's readership).\nBut is the fact that they had a non-diverse lineup of speakers proof that they explicitly excluded non-whites and non-males from participating? From what we know, that's not really the case. Ending up with a lineup of white male speakers, at a Ruby conference in England in the year 2012, is not at all an unlikely outcome for a selection process that ignores race and gender. I think you understand this.<p>But you're saying something else. You're saying that they should have made it a goal to have a diverse panel, by specifically taking into account race and gender to override other factors and get the diversity makeup you want. Don't immediately think of merit, either: it could have taken something such as offering a larger subsidy to get that one female speaker they wanted who had initially declined, or to fly in someone from Japan. Whatever it took, they should have done it, because the race and gender makeup has to be what you decide.<p>That's not being non-racist and non-sexist. That's positive discrimination, or affirmative action. It's a somewhat controversial policy that might have its place to rectify situations of long-ingrained oppression and prejudice, but it's certainly not the required standard for being non-racist and non-sexist in all situations. Certainly not at a conference for Ruby programmers in England in 2012!<p>Mind you, explicitly aiming for a diverse panel is still a fine goal for a conference organizer. But that's not to say that it should be the primary goal of <i>all</i> tech conferences in the world, and that any organizers who fail to put it at the top of their agenda should be publicly tarred and feathered as racists and have their conference boycotted and cancelled.<p>As well-meaning as I'm sure all people involved are, some parts of the tech community have reached a level of paroxistic politicization that will be detrimental to the community itself. We're going to lose conferences, and we're going to lose people who feel uncomfortable with this forceful imposition of ideological attitudes.",1353274753

Why aren't you saying ""I'm sure that if a greater percentage of successful businesses are started by white dudes , there must be a good reason for it""? Looking at the demographics of success stories is actually not at all helpful. In fact it would only be helpful if an equal number of startups began as 1 founder vs 2. Otherwise this data tells us nothing.<p>Let's look at this from a different perspective. Assume that the data conclusively shows that 2-founder startups have a higher chance of success than 1-founder startups, by a huge margin (say 10x). Does that mean that you should seek a co-founder before launching your startup? Even then, it does not. Consider two different startup ideas, one is founded on a very solid plan with a good chance of success, the other is founded on a bad plan with a lot more risk. The good plan is going to have a much easier time of finding a co-founder, because the potential co-founder will look at the idea and see that it has a lot of merit and potential and they'll be enthusiastic about joining in, whereas the bad idea will have a much harder time finding co-founders. However, imagine if someone with a bad startup idea pushes much, much harder to get a co-founder because they have learned that startups with co-founders are more likely to be successful. Will that help the company's prospects any or will it just warp the equation and result in a bad company failing even with a co-founder?<p>I think it's more important to go about a startup with your head screwed on straight than to attempt to imitate the forms of previous success. If you find someone you trust who seems to be a valuable addition to your startup as a co-founder, then by all means make that partnership. But if you can't find a co-founder for whatever reason but you are still quite convinced of your business plan then I don't think you should wait. You should certainly be careful that you aren't deluding yourself and be sensitive to any criticism of your startup idea nonetheless, but a good plan is a good plan even if you go it alone.",1353273595

Confidence intervals are a worst-case technique and posterior probabilities are a sort of average-case technique. It's not ""wrong"" to say that the worst-case runtime of QuickSort is O(n^2) and it's not wrong to say that, given a uniform probability distribution over inputs, the expected runtime is O(n log n).<p>Which statement is useful to make depends on your requirements. They're both true.<p>In my ""100 independent robots"" example, for instance, the credibility interval or posterior probability produces answers that are not helpful for the application (and not particularly intuitive either -- the 70% credibility interval is ""wrong"" 80% of the time, given a certain value of the parameter). This can be a question of engineering and there's no need to be dogmatic about it.<p>It is perverse and incorrect to say that ""Only frequentists think in terms of toolboxes""! All mathematicians and engineers have access to the whole world of theorems and algorithms and techniques, all of them true, or meeting their specifications. No mathematician would argue that the Chinese remainder theorem is wrong because they are a Galois theorist! And no practitioner of Bayesian methods should argue that confidence intervals that meet their worst-case coverage guarantee are ""wrong"" because the person uses posterior probabilities.<p>(My quibble here is with dogmatism, not with Bayesians, because the dogmatic frequentists are just as bad.

I was thinking in particular about this particular paragraph from the OP:<p>""Early on in my first company I had an employee ask if it was a good time to buy a home. We had less than 6 months cash in the bank. I was pretty sure we were going to raise another round of capital. But not sure, sure. I mean you never know if your investors are REALLY going to keep backing you. And you cant go around telling all of your employees your deepest insecurities about it or youll soon have no more of said employees.""<p>He never actually completes the thought (what did he actually tell the guy?), but this isn't some vague insecurity we're talking about. If the runway ends in 6 months without more funding, you owe it to your employees to be honest about it. It sounds to me like he witheld the information because he was worried his employees would leave if he didn't.<p>3. I think there's a lot of substance and humility in what you've said and I appreciate that.  What I meant is more that the OP just smacks of self-congratulations.  ""Look at me.  Look at all this bullshit I put up with.  Be like me... if you dare.""<p>x. I think it makes him sound childish rather than intense.",1353272632

Out in the civilian world you would never understand why this man was stopped but in the military world i would yave done the exact same thing. You only cry foul when nothing happens but when thousands of people die you point the finger and say why didnt we look at this. This guy had hallowed shoes a watch witch could use as a time bomb and clothes to apply medical treatment if he got shot. Why didnt the tsa stop this guy and arrest him than do a back ground check. The tsa did a good job and found someone oddly suspicious. Get out of your security blanket and realise peiole want you dead and they will disguise themselves in any way possible to kill you. They will also do dry runs to see if tsa is doing their job before they bring in real explosives. Liberties have to be sacrificed at times in order to prevent your children and loved ones from dying it is impossible to protect with pure one hundred percent freedom of movement with zero checks and balances. This guy would red flag every single checkpoint in a military zone and guess what they know military checks this so instead they are making their way into the civilian world coming for your family, friends and loved ones. Eceryone will stop crying foul when their loved ones die",1353272502

While this could work for some things, I don't think it would work as well for subjects where he has deep, complex opinions or observations that he needs to impart without interruption. Still, I'll take what I can get.",1353272409

I did not notice any performance difference at all. Now, amd64 (x64, x86_64, whatever you may call it) has more registers than plain x86, so maybe the differences cancel each other out in this specific case.",1437901098

9950570,comment,9949991,9950499,0,0,Fr0styMatt8,,,"I really wish AMD would promote this type of thing more heavily in general (having advanced features that Nvidia restricts to their high-cost cards).  I seem to remember a similar thing with AMD being fantastic for Bitcoin mining and from memory it&#x27;s because Nvidia gimped certain features that were on the cards, while AMD did not.<p>(on that note, I&#x27;m constantly annoyed that despite it being Nvidia specific, everyone supports CUDA for everything cool).<p>I understand companies have to do this to segregate their products and that it&#x27;s impractical to have separate fab lines for a chip family for this kind of difference.  It&#x27;s still something I think AMD has a competitive advantage on though and they really need to push that alone (unless they just don&#x27;t really want to - to sell their own high-end professional cards).<p>A worse example of this is Nvidia cards not running in systems that have AMD graphics cards in them.  Which means, for example, you can&#x27;t buy a low/mid-range Nvidia card to sit in your system as a dedicated PhysX/CUDA card.  I&#x27;d consider such a setup for my system and I imagine there&#x27;s probably others like me out there.",1437900942

9950558,comment,9949722,9949722,0,0,staltz,,,"From what I&#x27;ve gathered throughout discussions[1], React has seen some experiments with RxJS Observables (or something inspired by Observables), but they want to avoid the learning curve associated with reactive programming, keeping React beginner-friendly.<p>MVI architecture[2] in Cycle.js is derived from thinking about UIs holistically, and realizing how the user is connected to the application. The user gives events to the application, flowing through a thick layer of abstraction: from hardware (mouse) to operating system, to browser, to DOM, then finally to your application. Intent in MVI is another layer of abstraction between those user events and the program&#x27;s state. The key here is to realize what is the source/owner of events: the actual human user. I think it makes no sense to think about events as owned by view components, it doesn&#x27;t match reality. PS: MVI arch can be done with React as well, you can e.g. use document.querySelector().addEventListener() globally and remove events from components. This is how Cycle.js just leverages DOM events (and custom DOM events too).<p>React has tougher challenges though, since they want to contain both DOM and Native and whatnot event systems in the same abstraction.<p>[1] <a href=""https://twitter.com/sebmarkbage/status/589966228938063873"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/sebmarkbage/status/589966228938063873</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://cycle.js.org/model-view-intent.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cycle.js.org/model-view-intent.html</a>",1437900625

But it&#x27;s not clear that that&#x27;s what happens in real life. For example, if China sends an excess of resources to &quot;the US&quot;, and in return &quot;the US&quot; gives China shares or bonds issued by US companies, then the extra resources are presumably used by these companies in a productive way. (When a company acquires capital on the market, it is usually to invest it.)<p>BTW, it seems to me that foreign investment is <i>always</i> caused by a trade deficit, not the other way around. If the Rest of the World (RoW) wants to invest in the US, it has to acquire dollars. The only way RoW can acquire dollars is to sell more stuff to the US than it buys from the US.

Regardless of whether you want gaming-level graphics or just basic VGA output, you need to give it an actual, real graphics card (there are exceptions with new cards by nVidia that understand VMs and let you &quot;create&quot; a graphics card out of a subsection of a more powerful card, but at prohibitive prices). AMD&#x27;s entire graphics card lineup, from their $20 to their $700 GPUs will let you do this. nVidia&#x27;s cards detect they&#x27;re being passed-through to a VM and won&#x27;t install the drivers, unless you perform a (risky) hardware hack or use their professional graphics cards that a) aren&#x27;t designed nor optimized for consumer graphics card use, and b) cost at least an order of magnitude more than their regular graphics cards.",1437898257

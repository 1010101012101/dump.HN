Families borrow to make investments and to get over rough patches.  They run deficits too.  I went into pretty deep debt to finance college and grad school and Im glad I did.<p>The whole credit system is based on the fact that if we had to pay cash-as-we-go for everything, wed seriously underinvest.  And thats true for families and governmentsand yes, you can overdo the borrowing thing.  But to flip too far the other way is equally dangerous.<p>So, while it sounds good and has some merit, Id use the govt budget=family budget argument with care and Id discount those who want to use it as a hammer to insist on instant cuts. </i><p>( * ) <i>Jared Bernstein joined the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities in May 2011 as a Senior Fellow.  From 2009 to 2011, Bernstein was the Chief Economist and Economic Adviser to Vice President Joe Biden, executive director of the White House Task Force on the Middle Class, and a member of President Obamas economic team.<p>Bernsteins areas of expertise include federal and state economic and fiscal policies, income inequality and mobility, trends in employment and earnings, international comparisons, and the analysis of financial and housing markets.<p>Prior to joining the Obama administration, Bernstein was a senior economist and the director of the Living Standards Program at the Economic Policy Institute in Washington, D.C.<p>Between 1995 and 1996, he held the post of deputy chief economist at the U.S. Department of Labor.</i>",1318837463

At first, it seems a good idea, but sound is notoriously hard to parse for machines. Heck, even for humans: I have a friend who is deaf of one ear, and he can't follow a conversation in a crowded room, not because of remaining ear's accuracy, which is very good, but because we need 1) two ears 2) a head in between and 3) a serie of tiny head moves to localize accurately sounds in our mental 3D reconstruction of the surrounding world.<p>Sound channel seem convenient as it transmits information without wire to the recipients, but there are not so many examples of a good controlling of a machine by sound channel. (Humans and animals are NOT machines, sorry to insist.) Other wireless channels may prove much more efficient, infrared is a common one, and maybe brain waves will work one day. I don't say sound channel is useless: Sound channel is very good at delivering emergency feedback to the human controller, for example.<p>Second, the human so-called natural language (which is actually purely artificial). This is one of the greatest invention of humankind and it is extremely powerful for conveying information between human beings, when they share a common language. Moreover, it fits extremely well with the needs and powers of human brains. But again, it would by a sin of anthropomorphism to believe that machines should use mainly natural language to get their instructions from human beings. Machines have their own needs and powers. A machine can beat the best on a chess board, but is still unable to tell a cat from a dog on a picture, which my 2-years old little boy does easilly, and for fun. Machine are different, and making them human-like is deceptive. Therefore Man-machine intraction is not to be modelized on Man-man interaction (even if, as stated above, a human-like metaphor may help).<p>I have been hired to work on natural language during Bubble 1.0, and it was already widely known that this thing doesn't work, is not efficient, and is not even what users really need.<p>Now let's see it from another angle. I had this morning a task to achieve: fix a broken window lifter in my car, in Beijing. It is not so easy. I first did find Suzuki's Chinese translation (lingmu), then searched ""lingmu fix car"" (in Chinese characters) on my phone's mapping app, then I did choose one workshop not too far away from my way to office, then I clicked ""call"" and called the provider to make sure they had the broken part, then clicked ""direction"" to get navigation direction to the place. I worked perfectly, I felt thankful to all who have made this possible. But I don't see where a Siri-like assistant, or even simple sound input, would have changed the game. Voice input could have been helpful during the ""fill the search field"" step, but if you know a bit about Chinese, you'll know that when typing Chinese you need to first fill the sound, and then <i>choose</i> the characters in a list. Maybe a Siri-like assistant could have helped me clicking on the ""get direction"" button, but this was not the hard part. The step where I chose the car fixing shop among ten or twelve is more interesting. I don't think too much intelligence in the process would help: even if the assistant would be able to ponder all parameters (traffic, distance, etc.) I would still want to choose myself in a list. Here, the most effective could be a map projection on the windscreen and an eye-tracker with a ""brain click"".<p>Actually, I think ""brain click"" has a lot of unveiled possibilites, and controlling a phone with that would also avoid adding to the overall noise, which is a big contemporary problem, and which I did not help too much writing this comment.",1318836454

Editors provide a valuable service, but there's no reason that needs to be bundled with the other ""services"" provided by publishers, most of which have become or are becoming irrelevant, particularly, IMO, the functions of providing capital and risk pooling. A traditional publisher would provide an author with a (usually small) advance on royalties to live on while writing the book (think of it as a payday loan in terms of financial soundness and you'll have the right idea there), front the money to print and distribute the book (a significant amount when you're talking paper), and assume the risk that the book would tank or that the author would flake out and not finish the book. They could do that because they'd pool the risk across a large number of books. If the editorial decisions about what to publish were sound overall, the publisher could make a profit despite losing money on individual books.<p>The cost of ""printing"" and distribution is headed toward zero and editing, cover art, and services can be purchased.

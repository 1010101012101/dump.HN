It&#x27;s a free market system if you can&#x27;t afford to live in an area then live somewhere where you can afford given what your job is. Nobody is entitled to a particular job in an area (if they are not paid enough) if they can&#x27;t (with the pay) afford the rent. I&#x27;d love to live many places but I have to consider the practicality. Hawaii would be nice! [1] As far as people getting pushed out because of rents being driven up, the answer to that is not to take property away from lawful owners.<p>Want to &quot;lower the rent&quot;? Government buys at fair market value some apartments or housing how about that? (Sure that will happen, right?) Fine as long as the rightful owners agree and everyone else in the community uses their tax dollars to pay for acquiring that property.<p>Given you are so unhappy about this would you use your tax dollars so that others could live and not have high rent?<p>[1] To clarify not because of housing prices but because of economic opportunity.

I like this idea.<p>About CAD tools for aerospace, it really depends on what CAD tools you use. Things like Pro/E and Solidworks explicitly allow you to put in specifications and tolerances, and also for interference checking and the like. For electrical design, there are tools that allow you to put in electrical requirements and run simulations on your design files to test against those requirements. So there are some ways of catching problems ahead of production.<p>Now, those tools aren&#x27;t available to everyone. So I&#x27;m on job #3 in this industry. Job #1 had me doing all my electrical designs in AutoCAD LT. No checking or simulations there (can&#x27;t even generate a bill of materials with this either)! All we had was a library of symbols that one of the engineers had made. Job #2 had me using Cadence ORCAD, but without any of the add-ons that made it useful (could generate a BOM, but couldn&#x27;t customize it, which meant that I was assigned to create an Excel macro to customize the BOM to meet our specific stock-keeping system&#x27;s requirements). Job #3, I have nothing because all the vast majority of the electrical designs are done somewhere else (they use CATIA). Whenever I actually do some design work, I&#x27;m reduced to taking screenshots of relevant areas in other schematic PDFs, then stitching them together in MS Paint, and then pasting those into a Powerpoint template. I wish I were kidding.<p>But with job #3 most of my time is spent on other things besides pushing dots, like testing and evaluating upgrades to our embedded systems (this kind of thing is one reason why I spend time here).",1438548864

Compared to my own experience with docker where after waiting for a few weeks I had to change my base images (as nobody was updating them) updating just a single shared library and having the vulnerability fixed is way easier!<p>This, of course, is true if those who maintain the software you use do care about backwards compatibility (which tends to be true for the &quot;boring&quot; stuff and false for the stuff considered &quot;cool&quot; - looking at you nodejs library developers who break my build at least once a month).",1438548108

It&#x27;s a big advantage, due almost entirely to discrimination, but one that will likely be obviated over time.<p>Ronda, on the other hand, grew up in an athletic household as the daughter of the first women&#x27;s judo champion, and that mother routinely pushed her towards a similar path.  She maybe didn&#x27;t get a chance at college wrestling (or maybe she did, hell if I know), but she got the relevant training regardless, which puts her ahead of the rest of the pack.<p>Ronda&#x27;s got a leg up, and it probably won&#x27;t persist ad eterneum, but for now, and probably the immediate future, she&#x27;s the best, and she&#x27;s earned it.

I think it&#x27;s because they&#x27;re too flexible -- people are always leaving, forming sub-groups, etc.  I like those people but they would never show up at my house to mow my lawn, as another commenter described.<p>Or maybe &#x27;flexibility&#x27; is the wrong word, since the groups I mention are activity-specific, and one&#x27;s interest in the activity ebbs and flows, whereas one&#x27;s interest in fellowship with other people in the quest for some kind of human-level goodwill would presumably be constant.",1438546243
9992217,comment,9990992,9992037,0,0,thetwiceler,,,"It seems misleading to say that intuitionistic logic assigns statements to one of the two values, True or False. There&#x27;s no symmetry between the notions of truth and falsity as there is in boolean logic.<p>You need to be very, very careful when talking about the size of the constructive reals. If you are working within constructive mathematics, if you describe the real numbers as setoids of Cauchy sequences with Cauchy-equivalence as the equivalence relation, then there are uncountably many real numbers. From a meta-theoretic perspective, it is obvious (as we are working in constructive mathematics) that every real number is in some sense &quot;computable&quot;.<p>Your notion that there are countably many constructive reals probably comes from definitions of the constructive reals from within classical set theory, wherein you must internalize some notion of what it means for a real number to be constructible, and so you are, in a sense, working meta-theoretically. Then it is no surprise that the computable real numbers are countable. After all, Skolem&#x27;s paradox says that, meta-theoretically, we could have countable models of the classical real numbers as well.<p>Additionally, meta-theoretically, we see that our definition of real numbers in constructive mathematics will also have a countable model when seen from the outside.",1438546225

Clearly it developed massively when the Brazilian ju jitsu guys came to dominate.<p>When a fighter wins with an unusually great use of a particular technique, the armbar, either a counter-method will become widespread, or if there isn&#x27;t a good counter the armbar will become ubiquitous. Either way the champion fighter will regress towards the mean.<p>As you say, psychological dominance is a factor. And dare I say that the women&#x27;s sport potentially is still in a younger stage of development. The first truly outstanding athlete to take up a somewhat niche sport, dominating over the lesser athletes currently present, is going to be hailed as one of the greats.

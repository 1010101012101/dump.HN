We have moved to the mainframe model and the new IT dept is now GAE, AWS etc. While cloud providers try to decentralize their infrastructure it seems that we are in the early days of figuring out how to do this, because for the past few days we have had major disruption to essential services like tumblr (for kitten photos) et al.<p>Fortunately to date the affected services are all non essential, mainly entertainment/trivial stuff like blogs, instagram, dropbox etc etc, but when we start to see things like water supply and electrical power management systems, hospital records, aviation system etc affected the consequences could be severe.<p>If the very best IT minds at AWS and GAE can't keep their systems running, what hope have government departments got?

However I think it would have been better to have clean code where the reader can understand what happens at each line. Here the massive usage of global variables makes it harder and unintuitive. Also there are a lot of functions which returns for instance 0 or 1 to signal their success or failure but then at the call sites their return values are always ignored. Also, the way the _expr functions works in the part 2 is really, really weird and unintuitive (but this is due to the all-in-global-variables design). I could go on with other issues, but all this is to point out the big caveat: one should not take the code of the article and try to grow the compiler to extend it because doing so <i>will</i> lead to horrible spaghetti code. And that really is too bad, because it would have been an even better exercise for beginners to extend such a small compiler.",1351273387

We declined their generous offer for the investment kit preparation as too risky for us given their lack of track record, but they would like to meet for more in-depth discussion and possibly some other kind of arrangement.<p>It's probably unrealisticfor us to think about a series A round before we have content licensed,let alone users and revenue. That said, what do you think about involving people like this in a startup?Are there any red lines that we shouldn'tcross here, for fear of making us unattractive to investors?

The smaller the range, the larger the noise component relative to the signal.<p>OTOH: (B) is a function of temperature:  All of the noise power before the final dial to your amp is passed through as is the signal, so the ratio stays constant.

I'm not negating what you said, I follow your reasoning, but it's not clear to me how/if you are negating my claim for evens (and it's just a claim).<p>I said:<p>f(f(f(n:even):odd):even)=(3(n/2)+1)/2=(3/4)n+1/2<p><pre><code>    is less than the initial (n:even) for n>4 (actually 2 is sufficient)\n</code></pre>\nThis would still occur in your strings. The fact that you can come up with strings that abitrarily begin with (or contain within them) these ""worst case"" alternations does not necessarily mean that it can cycle from it:<p>Let's change one of the cases in my original comment (diff-style):<p>< f(f(f(n:even):even):odd)=3((n/2)/2)+1=(3/4)n+1<p><    is less than the initial (n:even) for n>4<p>---<p>> f(f(f(f(n:even):even):odd):even)=(3((n/2)/2)+1)/2=((3/4)n+1)/2=(3/8)n+1/2<p>>    is less than the initial (n:even) for n>4/5... so every valid input<p>You cannot have two odds in a row so that's the only thing that CAN happen to that case, and it is now clearly anchored on an even, requiring that even to still be decreasing with respect to the initial even (now no more than 5 numbers prior) in every case. We can walk down these decreasing even steps until we are back in known territory (n<=8).<p>Of course, I'm happy to hear counter arguments./thoughts.",1351270915

The C language is clear in that it doesn't hold your hand.<p>>The Native Oberon and Blue Bottle operating systems were even used for several years as desktop systems at ETHZ.<p>You can write an operating system in lots of languages besides C (and it has been done aswell), yet all the operating systems/kernels in wide use these days are all mainly written in C or a combination of C/C++.<p>That you can write an operating system in language X is nothing new, the performance you get with language X however is. We've seem numerous 'safe language' operating system attempts which have died due to inactivity or as in Singularity's case been passed off to academia because MIcrosoft realised it had no commercial relevance.<p>>The only area where I concede it is hard to replace C is in embedded space, specially if we consider many developers are still using Assembly.<p>I disagree, in everything where performance and/or footprint is paramount there will be a need for languages such as C, as always there is room for competition but Go certainly isn't a candidate in my opinion. I haven't really looked into Rust yet, D on the other hand seems to have gained zero traction and is from what I gather primarily positioning itself against C++.",1351270836

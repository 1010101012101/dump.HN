Orange County is NOT Los Angeles!  :-)  If you're trying to not clutter up the map with too many dots then maybe pick state first, then zoom in and present regions/counties within the state.  I was almost disinterested in it until I figured out the regions within the region!<p>2.  If I click the dot twice, make the div disappear or reappear.  I had to click on a different dot to get to the one I really wanted again (e.g. click Los Angeles, then click San Diego, then try to click Los Angeles again)<p>3.  The div with the tweets in them is somewhat strange when hidden.  Too much is showing or something.  Maybe it's just the ugly arrow to expand???<p>4.  The floating tip helper is distracting.  Can't you must make a static info bar or something?  I dunno, maybe just me.<p>5.  The region ul - where you give extra regions - make it a little prettier.  Everything else looks so polished, and then that list looks not so polished. Make it look nice like the ""Happy Hour, Specials, Live Music....""<p>6.  I'm wondering if the UI would be more ""natural"" if you had a static div along top with the logo/region/info bar and facebook and add venue buttons.  Then, on left, just have the categories and the pop-out div for tweets.  This would allow you to reduce the width of the main div quite a bit and might end up with just as much (or more) map space.  But specifically, I think this would be more visually appealing to the eye.  Surround the entire map a border of some sort that's blackish in color like your main div.  It will feel more like an app then.  TO ME!<p>Hope this helps.  Congrats!  A good idea and a lot of work.  Very promising.<p>p.s. - All my input from web app on chrome browser.",1299894174

2315630,comment,2314453,2314713,0,0,beantree,,,"With GTK+3 and GNOME3, there is a push towards a development model like you've described. GNOME Shell's UI is written in Javascript, the core is written in C. Themes are done in a CSS-alike language. DBUS (a cross-desktop standard that works in both KDE and GNOME) provides data messaging and your ""UI & system events coming from a port."" This allows daemons (your ""server-like plugins"") to communicate across programs, share data, UI elements, and whatever else you feel like communicating between processes.<p>One of the most important changes is the gobject-introspection work, which allows library authors to annotate their library's API in a way that allows bindings to be automatically created for any language. This is how GNOME Shell is able to use Javascript to call into GTK+3. Developers wanting to develop for GTK+ in their favorite language, be it Ruby, Python, Lisp, C#, D, or anything else, don't have to write bindings themselves or wait for someone else to write them.<p>Many new GNOME applications and libraries are being written in Vala, a language with an object model based on GObject but a syntax like C#. It offers a modern language with garbage collection, and everything compiles down to C in the end. The same compiler can also compile a language called Genie, which is designed to have a syntax similar to Python (although, in my opinion, it hasn't done a great job at that yet, and I've seen no use of the language in the wild). It also compiles down to C.<p>Tensions are high in the FOSS desktop world right now but that's nothing new. Flare ups like this come and go. Sometimes the problems are fixed and we find new ones to argue about a few years down the line. Sometimes the wounds fester, become gangrenous, and people leave for good.<p>Most of us just want to write code we can use and have fun writing.",1299892889

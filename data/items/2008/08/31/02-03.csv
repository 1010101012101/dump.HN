I think what might make a cool site is somewhere for people to post random acts of kindness people have done for them. no real point to it, just feel good stories",1220150982

291194,comment,291132,291165,0,0,ojbyrne,,,"I'm curious as to how you define ""worst."" As someone who once upon a time studied English, I love this paragraph:<p><i>It's hard, though. It's a big jump. It's not sufficient to learn how to write C-like programs in Lisp. That's pointless. C and Lisp stand at opposite ends of the spectrum; they're each great at what the other one sucks at.</i><p>That's good writing. Summarizes the writer's opinion in an active voice without latinate verbs or excessively long sentences.",1220150489

A lot of what he does say is idiotic.  His entire lisp section, for example, is about an elisp system, which has absolutely nothing to do with the merits of learning real lisp.  ""Perl OO never really caught on.""  Um, have you looked at CPAN or the core module APIs in the last 8 years?",1220150102

I'll agree that there's a range, but the high end is 2-5x the low end, so if you don't know the exact number for different, you can't reasonably compare companies.<p>VCs always ask and they're constantly evaluating investments.  Why do you think that the less-practiced should wing it?",1220149583

Actually, cherry picking does work, but the cherries aren't clear until after all of the big engineer stock grants are gone.  VCs get to cut their losses and double-down on their wins.  Engineers don't.<p>Even if engineers averaged as much gain as VCs, the distribution will be different.  The typical VC would be close to the average because they get to make 10-20 bets/year while an engineer gets to make <1 bet/year.  As a result while the typical engineer would be far below average return.  (Yes, a small fraction of the engineers would be ahead, but ...)",1220149323

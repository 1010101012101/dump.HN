2778224,comment,2775789,2777956,1,0,derleth,,,"> Skip papers altogether and simply do a one-on-one interview about the topic to evaluate their knowledge of it.<p>OK, so you have to deal with the fact some people are intensely nervous around authority figures and a one-on-one is not going to reflect their knowledge: They'll be so nervous they won't be able to answer intelligently, or at their full capacity.<p>> Make students write papers in class.<p>Then for God's sake scale the paper sizes and complexity to class length. (You don't know how to do that. You think you do but you don't.)<p>> Don't assign homework. Grade entirely based on class participation.<p>This has all the downsides of the one-on-one coupled with all the downsides of large group dynamics: Some people are going to dominate the discussion, some people are not going to be able to get a word in edgewise, and there's nothing you can do to change that. The ones who dominate the discussion are not always the ones who are getting the material, and being a wallflower does not correlate with much of anything relevant to most college courses. (There are exceptions.)",1311022787

It has something called IO Completion Port API but it is quite different from respective #nix APIs and for that reason it is <i>very</i> hard to wrap it into something that resembles epoll/kqueue/etc interface. This in turn means that platform abstraction cannot be done at the socket API level and needs to be pushed higher up.<p>Many #nix devs would find the very idea of such effort repulsive -- their light and elegant code suddenly needs to be mangled and obfuscated with unnecessary abstractions to support that godawful operating system.

2778196,comment,2777883,2777883,2,0,aspir,,,"I went through the very same experience you're going through now, and ended up with Rails. The largest deciding factor was the size of the community in my geographic area. Sure, there's always going to be a nontrivial online community for any activity, and the online presence of Django is enough to keep you going. But, you'll need to get some face-to-face interaction in there -- at least I needed that when learning. Waiting for a message board post is not the same as asking a few questions back and forth with a more experienced developer.<p>My impression that I got from both communities is that while both are good at fostering the growth of existing members (most programming communities do this well). Django is really bad at ""evangelism,"" via teaching non developers to code via Python/Django or converting existing devs over to the framework. In contrast, the Rails community is better than most for profit groups at this (think about Microsoft's initiatives vs. something like Rails for Zombies).<p>For an example, compare the two homepages.

2778167,comment,2774254,2775150,5,0,bluehat,,,"I appreciate what you are trying to do but as a student I was consistently frustrated by peer presentations because I felt the quality of my education suffered. Likewise, while I'd be thrilled if somebody presented me with a high-quality video that would help improve my education, I would resent paying tuition to sit in a classroom and watch a recording that I could be watching from the comfort of my home in my off-hours.  We attend school to learn material and context yes, but also for the experience and dialog of getting to ask questions to a world expert. That is what makes the education more valuable than reading a book.  I am sad that you have chosen this as an element of your solution. However, if you publish that video or others online, please give us a link to it, it sounds wonderful.<p>Having students do individual research projects and then presenting can also be very hard on the students because one badly done presentation, if the material is never retaught, can create gaps in a student's education. This is particularly difficult for classes which are part of a sequence, where this lack of knowledge will impact a later class. You are creating work for yourself too, as the lectures which you teach which build upon these principles will frequently have to be adjusted to cover material which was not adequately expressed, and make it harder for you to recycle and perfect your slides.<p>Additionally, students in classes based on rotating presentations tend to specialize in what they presented. This gives them an unusual advantage on the test: the optimally localized behavior for a class on a curve is to learn the material, convey as little as possible while making the class feel well-informed, and then ace it on the test, thus lowering the curve. If you do insist on doing this, you should have the class' average success on the exam reflect in some way on the presenters.<p>This is the solution that I know <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2774695"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2774695</a> I posted it on your website as well.

Isn't a business that refuses to provide any of the necessary education for its employees profiting from a well-educated society without pitching in anything for the bill?

It makes it much easier for recruiters whose day jobs aren't recruiting to start a conversation, assists memory of the candidate, and also says good things about their attitude.<p>General advice for candidates (would be nice if this was communicated to the candidates on the web site, and sent out via email a few days before the event):<p>CV/rsum: Have one - one page, preferably.  On that, put your candidate number (and maybe a short description of your pitch/demo) - it saves the recruiters time trying to match that up with whatever notes they took before and during the event against the candidate number.  Link to your github/ohloh/HN or other places the recruiters can find out about how good you are.<p>Meet the candidates description: Make sure you're on it.  Make sure you have useful information in it.  When you're faced with a bunch of candidates and the description is all you can go on, you will prioritise the candidates to ensure you speak to the right people, and you might entirely rule out talking to candidates based on that description.  You don't want to short-sell yourself.<p>Demo/pitch/booth: The demo/pitch/booth is there to help initiate a conversation, so please have something prepared for people like me who don't initiate conversations with total strangers often.  Try show your ingenuity and attitude by making yourself stand out so that recruiters are more likely to remember you.<p>Some theories for the organisers:<p>I think it might be quite cool to mix the format up a bit by scheduling time where each candidate broadcasts something about themselves to the assembled group.  So, with 60-ish candidates, we could have 4 breaks during the day of 15 minutes (lunch/beverage breaks) where each candidate gets 1 minute to talk about their project (strictly supervised for time).  That provides another opportunity for the candidate to attract the interest of recruiters.<p>I spent a lot of time waiting for candidates to finish talking to other recruiters.  Coming up with a mechanism to reduce this would be great.  Maybe a part of the schedule later in the day where the candidate indicates that they're interested in speaking with a company that they haven't spoken to yet?<p>Things I will try to remember next time:<p>As a recruiter, I should have a page with job postings and contact details (and instructions to remember to mention the candidate number) to give out to each interesting candidate, and highlight the job postings that I think they would be well-suited for.<p>I spent a lot of time waiting for candidates to finish talking to other recruiters, so I should have some way to leave the candidate with my details so they can find me when they have a free moment.<p>My memory is really really bad.  I should write down more, and make sure to make the name-candidate number connection for every person I talked to.",1311021666

This is what makes squatting on such a massive scale possible.<p>Second, modern DNS structure is effectively a global namespace: there are only a handful of TLDs that matter and they are awfully generic, so they collide. TLDs do not classify anything, and they should. Also, if someone bought the name you want, there are no equivalent (but different) alternatives.

I'd disagree that an abstraction is an abstraction, though; some are more deceptive than others.<p>Node comes with single-threaded, callback-based async that works quite well, but it's a bit of a hassle to use for complex stuff.<p>Nothing wrong with that abstraction time! The async module, for example, comes with a few different callback-based flow-control patterns. The Buffy example would look something like this:<p><pre><code>    huntMen =(buffy)->\n        soulmates = []\n    \n        getSoulmate =(callback)->\n            mate = {}\n            async.series [\n                (cb)->getThumbnail u, (thumb)->cb null, mate.thumb = thumb\n                (cb)->isPicAVampire thumb, (is_vamp)->cb('vampire' if is_vamp)\n                (loaded)->async.parallel [\n                        (cb)->getPersonality u, (p)->cb null, mate.personality = p\n                        (cb)->getLastTalked u, match, (l)->cb null, mate.last_talked = l\n                        loaded\n                    ]\n                ], (err)->\n                    soulmates.push mate unless err\n                    callback()\n        async.whilst (->soulmates.length < 10), getSoulmate, ->\n             #Do whatever with soulmates\n</code></pre>\n(I don't actually use async much, so forgive me if there's an error there.)<p>Async's abstractions are what I would call ""honest"". It's still using callbacks, it's obvious what the relationship between them is. The meanings of 'series' and 'parallel' are clear; I could write them out myself, it'd just take longer. Nothing about what this code does is being obscured by the abstraction, just made prettier. I know (or can easily work out) exactly what will be executed.<p>Tame is abstracting the same single-threaded, callback-based async, but it's trying to make it <i>look</i> like it's using threads. I know in theory it must be turning my code into callbacks which are being passed around, but it's <i>deliberately</i> trying to make that unclear. The result is that I have a somewhat worse understanding of what my program actually does.<p>To be clear, I don't have a huge beef; like you say, abstractions are necessary, and Tame seems fine to me. It's just my personal preference for more honest abstractions over more dishonest ones (no doubt heavily influenced by the fact that I actually love callback-based async, which I think puts me in a small minority.)",1311020628

Probably.

And the solution is:<p>1) A flood of government equity, distributed by those ever-so-entrepreneurial bureaucrats.  There is, of course, no chance that the same people who brought us ethanol subsidies (""so stupid not even the Soviets tried it""), the Fannie Mae housing bubble and the $3000 hammer won't screw it up.<p>2)  A no-cost-to-government expansion of Medicare, which I'm sure has some Canute-like power to push back the tides of adverse selection.  For efficiency and quality of service provision, please refer to sarcasm in point 1).<p>3) Tax credits for jobs created -- there was a day when this sort of thing was called ""profit"", which entrepreneurs were allowed to keep, but I suppose funding 1) and 2) will finally put paid to this dwindling concept.<p>Jokes about ""liberals"" would be easy, but unfair, as Congressional conservatives have been just about as bad, AND in violation of principles that should have guided them better.<p>Why on God's green earth would _programmers_ slap kludges like these on fundamental system failures?  If someone proposed fixing bugs this way the collective sneering here would break the internet.<p>We've got billions (trillions?) already deployed in ""education"", whose product is widely understood as unsatisfactory at best.  We just had a post showing that about 25% of the students at a well-regarded university are interested in nothing but the grade, and are so unprepared they can't imagine any way to get it on their own.  Why not fix THAT?<p>And why is it that all fixes proposed amount to hurling more man-months at the problem?<p>I'm sure you mean well, and there's no doubt the problems are complicated, but seriously, this sort of thing lacks the thought I presume HN types bring to work every single day.",1311019483

A huge part of hacking IMHO is taking an open system that is sometimes quite complex (like an OS), shedding your fear of breaking things, and tinkering.  When things do break, you will learn so much from fixing them.  =)  It is a lot of fun, free, and will get your feet wet with some of the other stuff that mechanical_fish mentioned.<p>I also recommend Emacs.  I haven't worked with git just yet, but I use Mercurial all the time (and I will eventually get around to using git).  Avoid CVS like the plague.",1206823674

I would say they're in love with the form, but they don't mention doing any writing.  I would say they're in love with great art, but they don't mention any other forms.  (Is it a NYC thing?

A true statement spoken by the devil doesn't make that statement false.\nNext, it's very hard for someone to correctly divine the motives of another.  It is often the case that it's easier to make up base motives and assign then to an opponent than it is to refute their argument.\nFinally, that people ""decide their position on an issue and then seek supporting evidence"" simply shows that ""people"" are idiots.",1206823297

All you have to do is startup your own web company and you too can retire at 17 or 19 years old and party like it's 1999.<p>These guys did very well for a years worth of work and deserve every penny. But don't for a second think these guys are gonna go out and buy Aston Martins or live in the Four Seasons with their ""millions"".<p>Funding:\nyCombinator: $25,000 - $35,000\n(Some articles say there were 4 founders ($25k) but their own website show 6 people ($35k))\nAngels: $400,000\nFrom Paul Buchheit and Chris Sacca<p>Ownership:\nyCombinator: 2-10% (Typically 6%)\nAngels: Unknown but split among 2 people\nFounders: Unknown but split among 4 to 6 people<p>Exit:\n$5 Million Composed of: \n- $2 Million Cash\n- $3 Million Stock in CMNN.OB<p>So YC's take is $100,000 (2%) to $500,000 (10%) (Typically $300,000 (6%)) \nAngels take is unknown but if they made no return it would be $400,000. However its likely that they made at least 1x return.<p>This would leave about $4 million to be split among the 4-6 founders. So they each made a little ONE million or less. Of course a large portion ($3 million) of their earnings are stock, so their actual earnings could be a lot more (multiple millions) in the future than what they are now. However, they are in effect paper millionaires as none of them have $1 million in cash.<p>The deal was announced around 12:00am PST March 26, 2008. March 25, 2008 close of CMNN.OB was $2.69. Friday's close was $2.62. So its possible that 2.6% has already been shaved off that $3 Million. The actual amount obviously depends on what price they obtained the stock at.<p>Let's also not forget that these guys are leaving the valley, moving to Vancover and will likely be settling into their 9-5 jobs with bosses, office politics and other employees at Live Current in a few weeks.<p>It will be interesting to see how everything turns out in a few years time.

149637,story,,,2,1,paul_reiners,"Q about Exercise 13.3(b) in ""ANSI Common Lisp""",,"Has anyone else worked on exercise 13.3(b) in ""ANSI Common Lisp""?  I approached it by declaring all the variables in Figure 9.2 as long-floats:<p><pre><code>  ; Use declarations in math utilities:\n  (defun sq (x) \n    (declare (long-float x))\n    (* x x))\n  \n  (defun mag (x y z)\n    (declare (long-float x y z))\n    (sqrt (+ (sq x) (sq y) (sq z))))\n  \n  (defun unit-vector (x y z)\n    (declare (long-float x y z))\n    (let ((d (mag x y z)))\n      (declare (long-float d))\n      (values (/ x d) (/ y d) (/ z d))))\n  \n  (defstruct (point (:conc-name nil))  \n    x y z)\n  \n  (defun distance (p1 p2)\n    (mag (- (x p1) (x p2))\n         (- (y p1) (y p2))\n         (- (z p1) (z p2))))\n  \n  (defun minroot (a b c)\n    (declare (long-float a b c))\n    (if (zerop a)\n        (/ (- c) b)\n        (let ((disc (- (sq b) (* 4 a c))))\n          (declare (long-float disc))\n          (unless (minusp disc)\n            (let ((discrt (sqrt disc)))\n              (declare (long-float discrt))\n              (min (/ (+ (- b) discrt) (* 2 a))\n                   (/ (- (- b) discrt) (* 2 a))))))))\n</code></pre>\nHowever, the running time slowed down as a result of this change, rather than sped up.<p>Note that I used long-floats, rather than double-floats, because, when I used double-floats, the output was slightly different (only off by 1 on some values) than the original version in which variables were undeclared.  However, the output was slightly different with long-floats, too, so I guess that didn't help.<p>Anyway, should declaring these variables make the program faster, or am I doing the problem incorrectly?  And why is the output slightly different if I'm using the largest size floating-points?

Of course they would write something like this, they probably make their living off selling these sorts of pie-in-the-sky ideals to people.  The whole tone of this article is pretentious and insulting.  Personal attacks are perfectly valid forms of argument and communication.  If you look at these things in terms of effectiveness, they are usually more practical approaches that yield results, especially in the political realm.  One thing they write is:<p>'If you can't find an actual quote to disagree with, you may be arguing with a straw man.'<p>That isn't true.  Using analog-situation arguments and reductions to absurdity to point out the fallacies of a point is a long-used, valid practice.  The central point of their writing seems to be that addressing substance using reason is the most effective way of arguing.  They write:<p>""The force of a refutation depends on what you refute. The most powerful form of disagreement is to refute someone's central point.""<p>and point out that refutation is the strongest from of argument against some other point,  Well, ""strongest"" is a subjective evaluation and I would like to point out that in the history of argument and in particular political discourse, usually it is the loudest, angriest, and downright scariest people in the argument who win; for example, look at the Nazis in Germany in the 1930s  So these people have it just plain all wrong.<p>There, now, did I miss anything? =)<p>Great piece, really, I loved it.

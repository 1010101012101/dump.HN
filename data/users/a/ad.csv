adsyme,,1,0.0,7,0,"With a strong background in advertising & communication, back in 2001, Frdrick designed the very first european magazine fully dedicated to mobile entertainment services (when logos where B&W and ringtones...monophonic), SMSMAG, distributed via street marketing teams in BE, FR & UK, which generated 4M+ mobile downloads. He also developed an innovative B2B service dedicated to the real time correction of wrongly spelled logos & ringtones requests, which was used by the main EU players in the early days of mobile entertainment. The platform evolved to become the first mobile contact centre, handling a variety of txt-based requests. This gave birth to the SMSCASH concept in late 2005, the first txt-based consumer loan service, sold to Laser Cofinoga (FR) in July 2006 after grossing 15M euro of loans production. Having completed those two mobile/internet ventures, Frdrick invested as an active business partner / VC in a spin-off of ATC Management (London), managing the careers of The Boxer Rebellion / The Staves / Fink / Ethan Johns. He is still very active on the indie scene, occasionally promoting concerts in Belgium and in London. He also runs a boutique label (Les Disques Modernes), which signed two Belgian bands and released in the UK the album of an iconic Belgian act (Ks Choice). In october 2010 he co-promoted the Belgian edition of the European Japan Anime Live tour (arena manga & anime show). In 2011 he realized his childhood dream by writing & producing his first family circus show, Le Rve dIgor by Le Cirque Moderne, which was staged in two different versions for more than 150 performances in 2011 and 2012. In 2013, Frdrick is back to the mobile scene with an exciting disruptive venture: adsy.me, the first mobile web app enabling anyone to create & share beautiful mobile apps on the go.",1382274764,1450207814

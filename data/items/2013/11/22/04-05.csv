They can be authenticated by the officers who took them. The officers merely state that they tackled Ross in the library, and that they personally photographed what was on the screen, and that the image you see is said photograph. You are of course correct that they could be fabricated, but that&#x27;s up to his defense attorney to argue, and for a jury to believe is enough to constitute &quot;reasonable doubt&quot; in their collective minds.<p>3) Again, evidence does not have to be perfect. Everything you argue applies to any kind of evidence. What&#x27;s to say the witnesses testimony wasn&#x27;t coerced? The letter forged? The rules of evidence come into play here, as well as the jury&#x27;s role in deciding what to believe.

There are three main scenarios where condoms are helpful to society:<p>1) As a form of birth control. In this case the woman may not have access to other forms, and she has to rely on the man wearing a condom. If the man doesn&#x27;t like it she is often left without options (particularly in jurisdictions where - unfortunately - consent laws are different for women who are married). Even if a women doesn&#x27;t like sex with a condom she usually prefers it to yet-another-baby.<p>2) As a protection against sexually transmitted disease. A subset of that is sexually promiscuous women who dislike condoms (and in that case you are 100% correct - a condom which feels good to women will help). However, the other case - women who are paid to have sex - is unfortunately more common, and in that case the woman often has few options if the man doesn&#x27;t want to wear a condom.<p>3) Gay Sex. Obviously this is really a subset of (2) above, but I&#x27;m putting it separately because it&#x27;s quite a large vector for sexually transmitted diseases, and increased condom use would cut it dramatically.",1385094608

Perhaps this Pi initiative is less commercial than philanthropic and was initiated by Conrad. \nSecondly, if you look at Wolfram&#x27;s own blog post[2] on the Pi release of Mathematica, he talks about his new Wolfram Language far more than about the Pi platform.

If he&#x27;s busted with a bunch of fake IDs on his person, I&#x27;d consider that to be evidence proper.<p>But anything transpiring in the netherworld of the internet needs to be taken with a grain of salt, especially when no real-world violence erupted.<p>It may be possible that this is the guy. The evidence that rings truest in my mind is that there was a real world cause-and-effect chain of events that occured immediately after his arrest. The shit hit the fan, and the site went down. Clearly, the real world arrest had a direct influence on the availability of the website.<p>But given the DEA&#x27;s predilection for parallel construction, and the NSA&#x27;s predilection for electronic dragnets, can we take the narrative of how they came to bust the Ulbricht at face value? Even if he was breaking the law, was he apprehended lawfully? Did they come into possession of this digital evidence in a lawful manner?<p>If Ulbricht gets off on a technicality for the crime he&#x27;s charged with, I wouldn&#x27;t lose sleep over it. He&#x27;s being charged with the hypothetical thoughtcrime of killing an internet persona (or two). To me, that feels like a technicality to begin with.<p>If the people he killed never existed to begin with, then how can we be sure that the evidence that supports these ideas was collected and not crafted?<p>He may be the real deal, the guy himself, responsible for The Silk Road. But if you&#x27;re going to put him away with that in mind, justice is not served unless he&#x27;s charged with the crime he&#x27;s being punished for, and justified by the true story of how they nailed him. I want to know what was truly so evil about The Silk Road, such that it might necessitate some sneaky peaky, in order to lock up the man responsible for it.<p>Maybe they achieve their goal of unmasking him, through this direct relationship of arrest and then site outage, but does that mean we have to swallow this murder-for-hire wrap too, no matter how flimsy it feels?",1385093147

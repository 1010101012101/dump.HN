More features doesn't mean better.<p>What i like about LighTables is that it seems to have few features, but do them well. It has a nice clean UI (even if it's just mockup, i don't think it needs anything else) and the UX seems nice too from what i understood.<p>Maybe what you didn't understood is that it's NOT an IDE for computer scientists : it's more aimed to visual programmer, webdev, or gamedev, creativecoders. People that want to do both design and coding.<p>BTW : i just trashed Eclipse, not anyone.

3874703,comment,3874324,3874505,0,0,Someone,,,"Yes, but most, if not all, of the concept has been done before. Given that, I think the question why things would work better this time is one that the backers of this project should think about before starting development.<p>My input would be that I think the cute displays in the video will not work on real-scale projects. One reason is that I do not see how the most interesting part, the live display of a call graph, will work as nicely as displayed in the video with:<p><pre><code>  - functions that manipulate disk or network state\n  - large functions\n  - deeply nested functions, in particular recursive ones\n</code></pre>\nI can envision each of them, but all in a somewhat ugly way. The first would require programmers to write set-up and tear-down code; the second and third would eat screen real estate and/or would involve scrolling and/or collapsing.<p>If you have to write that setup and teardown code, I do not see how this interactive way of testing code is that much better than writing unit tests.<p>Translating that into constructive feedback: I would aim for building a good tool for education first; then, work on the scaling problem. But, be prepared: you should be happy if you get the education part only; you may not find a way to scale this up to real-world projects. And you should also realize beforehand that, if this does not scale, the educational program may be seen as a toy, only useful in the first half-year or so, only because 'real programmers' do not use it. It may take time to overcome that, just like it took (or even: is taking) time to overcome the notion that real programmers do not use IDEs.<p>[Going on a tangent: I would love to have a system that allowed me to split unit tests into API examples and all the other tests (timing tests, integration tests specific to certain bugs, etc.) That way, the documentation system could grab the first kind of tests and show them in the documentation.<p>I also would like to see a system that forbid me to write code that is not covered by a unit test yet. For example, in C, it would force programmers to write the header file first, the unit tests exercising part of the code second, and the actual code last. It should allow me to write the whole header file, then implement and test that header in parts, though. I also might hate it the moment I see it, but I need to see it to discover that.]",1335098973

Incentives to get this ticket is that is acts as a lottery ticket also, with modest prizes.<p>3. The tax enforcement is therefore 'crowdsourced' because if any customer doesn't receive this ticket then they can report the business.<p>4. Any fapiao tickets leftover can be used for tax rebates.<p>The biggest problem I see is that businesses have to prepay tax which is 'estimated'.

3874669,comment,3874324,3874324,85,0,edanm,,,"Everyone is jumping in to disagree with the OP.<p>I have to be honest: I thought the OP's points were very well made, and as much as I loved the LightTable demo, I think I immediately dismissed it, in my mind, as ""looks cool, but can't be made"".<p>I think there is a big disconnect between this author, a ""working programmer"" who actually writes code, and at least <i>some</i> of the commenters in this thread. Let me give my take on a few of the differences:<p>For one thing, the op mentioned that, while functions <i>should</i> be small, they usually aren't. And while functions, ideally, <i>should</i> be self-contained, most of the code people write is a mixture of calls to external sources, libraries, etc. I.e., things that <i>can't</i> be seen ahead of time. In practice, the OP is 100% correct. Most of the code I see, ends up being <i>exactly</i> this kind of code. I question whether anyone who claims otherwise has any experience with real systems. I just can't imagine anyone disagreeing that most code looks like this in the real world.<p>Another point of disconnect is the ""I don't use an IDE"" theme that's common here. I think you'll find that HNers, as a whole, are a lot more prone to be anti-IDE. Much of the ""real world"" programmers would be shocked that so many HNers give up the comfort of all that the IDE provides. And, at least to my mind, there is an attitude here that using an IDE makes you a worse programmer.<p>The truth is, the author is correct to point out that a lot of the cool stuff in the demo already exists. If for no other reason than to point out that, if you think a lot of the cool stuff shown in the demo is worth looking into, you might want to check out Eclipse or other IDEs.<p>Finally, let me make one final point, specifically to zacharyvoase and the others who think this post is ""against the spirit of Hacker News"", etc. I totally understand you, and I agree, the LightTable creator deserves a lot of credit for what he's trying to do, whether successful or not. But I think that a critique of the project, especially showing which parts of it have already been created, is <i>amazingly</i> beneficial. No, the OP did not offer many suggestions. But I imagine that, if the LightTable group did <i>not</i> know about some of the things that Eclipse does already, this post will help them out. And this post will certainly get them thinking about whether some of what they demoed is possible.<p>In fact, if it were me running the LightTable project, I might decide to start with an MVP of building LightTable as an Eclipse plugin, to check out some of their concepts.<p>Edit:<p>P.S. I shouldn't have to give ""credentials"" for expressing a view on HN, but I will anyway. I've been programming professionally for 8 years, and I now run a freelance/consulting software company so have seen many codebases.<p>More importantly, I'm an IDE and editor nut. Most of the start of my career was on Visual Studio, then SlickEdit, and since then I've tried out many IDEs and editors. I now mostly use Vim, while sometimes dropping into SublimeText.<p>I think Eclipse is an amazing tool, and couldn't imagine programming Java without it. I think most people here would be absolutely amazed at the help Eclipse gives in writing Java code, which I'm sure gives many programmers a huge boost in their time to code.",1335097789

3874639,comment,3874528,3874528,2,0,EvilTerran,,,"I'd say ""don't use booleans as <i>positional</i> parameters"" for the reasons the article discusses - as it's completely non-self-documenting. Take one of the examples:<p><pre><code>  str.replace(""%USER%"", user, false);\n</code></pre>\n... where it transpires the last parameter is case sensitivity. The article's suggestion of using enumerations (or algebraic types) would be an improvement in languages that make that easy, sure:<p><pre><code>  enum CaseSensitivity { CaseInsensitive, CaseSensitive }\n  ...\n  str.replace(""%USER%"", user, CaseInsensitive);\n</code></pre>\n... but introducing types that are conceptually booleans seems like a contrived way to self-document. Named parameters would be preferable to either, IMO:<p><pre><code>  str.replace(""%USER%"", user, case_sensitive = false);</code></pre>",1335096150

Exactly where side-effects occur can be difficult to determine, there's no simple way to work around this.<p>This is less of a problem in Clojure, thanks to its immutable data structures, but they're not a panacea.  I'm also not sure how well this would work in JS and Python, the other languages that Light Table intends to initially target.<p>One possible solution is to have hooks into side-effects: you could display console output or logging alongside the instant evaluation.  The real difficulty is network communication: even if you're okay with actually sending requests over the wire, there's an awkward balance between visibility and generality.  Something like libpcap [1] is very general, but gives minimal insight into the content.  Hooking into a particular HTTP client library gives you a lot more visibility into what's going on, but you'll need to do this every time you want to use a new library.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.tcpdump.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tcpdump.org/</a>",1335096132

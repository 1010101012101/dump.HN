The iPod was when apple just used a rocket booster to jump ahead of the game, and finally their steam is running low.<p>- The iPod was revolutionary.\n - The iPod was never quite cloned ""correctly"" there was more to the iPod than meets the eye. By the time Apple removed the DRM restrictions it was too late for consumers, Apple had already made a dent in the market which others could not recover from.\n - When everyone finally caught up to the iPod... poof there goes the iPhone again darting apple ahead of the game. For at least 2 years before again anyone even came close.\n - The iPad is another attempt to do the same, but by now it did not dart them as far as the iPhone did. The competition is now riding on unicorns and are hard to out-meneuver.<p>2) Apple literally filled the void of the tech industry. The void was in usability. It was simple, give users a very friendly UI, and lets do away with core concepts we find important but most don't. I don't know how to explain ""files"" to my grandfather. He asks me ""will my programs be there when I leave home with my laptop?"" I tell him yes and no. You need an internet connection because to him his ""programs"" are the websites he visits. He can't even grasp the concept of moving files from hard disk to usb flash drive. To him ""files"" are mythical unicorns. And I see this from many people, he is just the best example. Apple is trying to cater to the audience of people who are completely lost with computers by making computers behave like ""real"" objects are inside them. The ipad is a great example because it makes things tangible. A child can understand it.<p>The point at the end is this: Apple never had ""features"" they had ""usability"". OSX is a great OS because it combines user friendliness with unix. That is why developers love it. Hey I can't get over how awesome it is that uninstalling an application is dragging it from applications to trash (just got a mac). And to top it all off its quite easy to find all configurations and such for any installed application. On top of it all I don't feel like I need to re-install mac osx every 6 months like I had to with windows xp. AND to make it even better their keyboard shortcuts are a perfect fit for a laptop keyboard without having to resort to a lack of home/end/page up/page down keys. I swear check out those 4 frequently used keys layout in ANY pc laptop. It is insanity. Look at mac, the defaults are made so that you can use the say layout/combinations everywhere, brilliant!<p>In the end apple is running out of steam. I think they will level out in a year or two taking their place as the new Microsoft of the industry (which is fine). I just wish macs were not so f-ing expensive.

Either:<p>1. What you want as your end outcome, or,<p>2. What the next step is<p>That's it. Thinking ""Oh man I'm going to have to go exercise for six months to get my weight and energy where I want..."" - too much, that's too much for anyone. So think instead: What's my end goal? I want to be fit, long lived, with lots of energy. Okay. What's the next step? Go out for a 15 minute walk while listening to something pleasant. Then celebrate that.<p>Don't focus on ""the path"" - the stuff that needs to be done. It's too much. Focus on what you want, and then ask what's the next action? It's taking a 15 minute walk. You can take a 15 minute walk. No problem.<p>> You know what scares me the most? That I might not be smart enough/hard-working enough to actually make it work.<p>Yeah, that's classical deterministic thinking right there. The ability to ""actually make it work"" doesn't come from being ""smart enough/hard-working enough"" - making it work isn't an inborn inability, it comes from regular, incremental training. Definitely check out Waitzkin's Art of Learning. It'll do wonders for you. It's a light, easy, pleasant read too.<p>> I actually know that in all probability I don't have a future. Unlike, almost all of my peers I really can't have a linear life, and that is shit scary.<p>Do your best to catch yourself saying stuff like that, and then cut down on how much you say it. There's nothing magical about having a functional life. You figure out what you want in the long term (this takes some thinking on, and it's time well spent - it's actually pretty enjoyable to think about). Then you ask, ""What's the next action?"" 15 minute walk, go to the grocery store and buy oatmeal/tuna/rice/fruit, clean all your clothes and throw out the junk in your room, just reduce your email inbox a little bit from 700 down to 600 by deleting a few useless things (recently I got my inbox from 700 emails down to 3 emails over the course of two weeks, just one step at a time on it...). It's always, ""What's the end goal? Okay. What's the next small step?""<p>There's no probability here, you're not rolling dice. If you think about what you want and take gradual steps to get there, you're almost certain to get there. If you introduce good foods to your diet while gradually quitting bad foods, your energy levels will improve. That's almost a certainty. That's how life works. You can do it. Celebrate the small wins, a successful life is a series of stringing small wins together, which eventually compound into bigger wins. In the end, it's not rocket surgery, and should be possible to anyone. You can do it.",1278220791

As it was discovered in 1929, it can hardly be said that the decipherment was an arduous process.  The significance of the computer program is along the lines of:<p>> The key strength of our model lies in its ability to incorporate a range of linguistic intuitions in a statistical framework.<p>As someone working in NLP, this is quite remarkable, and I don't mean to detract from it; but it should be noted that the model (like the linguists) relied on the fact that Ugaritic is closely related to Hebrew.  It would be impossible to use such a model to decipher Linear A, which is probably not related to any known language.  (But the model could perhaps be used to check if linguists had overlooked any connection between Linear A and another known language.)",1278220356

Let's assume that your gold is really worth $200.<p>They receive it and appraise it, sending you a check for an amount they deem fair.  Sometimes as low as 10% of the fair market value.  In your case, $20.<p>You have a set amount of time (I believe 5-7 business days) to either accept this amount by cashing the check or returning it and requesting that they return your jewelry.  Some people claim that this time starts from the date of issuance of the check, not the date you received it.  Others report that their jewelry cannot be located, so they have no choice to accept the small payment.<p>Those who insist that they will not accept the small payment get a call from a ""senior gold appraiser"" who, upon further review, offers them a higher amount, sometimes double the original payment (the $20 magically becomes $40).  People claiming to be former employees claim that they get a commission based on how little they can offer you to get you to agree.",1278220215

They tried, remember?<p>Google as an institution knows even less about selling retail products than the average hot dog vendor. Meanwhile, Apple has very deliberately spent a decade building the best direct-to-customer retail operation in the tech industry, perhaps even in <i>any</i> industry.<p>So Google's customer-facing sales operation consists of mobile phone carriers. That's been effective so far, though I still wonder how much of its success is driven by the existence of iPhone carrier exclusivity -- nothing motivates Verizon to sell, sell, sell those Android devices like the threat of losing a flood of subscribers. But carriers are only interested in selling phones, because phones come with usage fees and contracts.<p>The lack of direct connection to the customer has all sorts of side effects on Google's business, and one is that they have no obvious way to effectively bring an Android-powered iPod Touch to market. They need to build a retail system from scratch - an even more difficult version of the task at which Gateway, Sony, and Microsoft have already failed - or they need a partner. Which partner? Existing gaming companies, the ones with the brands, all have their own platforms. Microsoft, for the moment, has their own platform. PC vendors have been selling commodity widgets for so long that they've forgotten how to sell something new. Is Google supposed to just buy shelf space at Best Buy and hope?

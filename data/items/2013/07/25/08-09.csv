Also the argument against selectors is nonsensical unless we&#x27;re suggesting that xpath is wrong. The only reason selectors are for styling is because that is the approach taken by browsers and so you are tunnel visioned into believing that is the case. They are not &quot;for&quot; styling, they are selectors use &quot;by&quot; styling. I similarly don&#x27;t see what drawing parallels to C has anything to do with it.<p>I&#x27;d also like to point out that in a good portion of JS projects HTML and JS have a symbiotic relationship so the notion that you have to scrub out all the HTML as &quot;best practice&quot; is entirely incorrect in my eyes, thus the failing/winning example makes no sense without context. Is that HTML pre-baked into the page by the server? Then it makes complete sense to be that way. Are you hand generating it from strings? Not ideal, but there are tons of far more elegant ways to solve that already and they don&#x27;t require you to still be writing HTML in your JS (even if it looks like JSON it still has a single purpose and is wedged directly into your code).<p>At least existing templating solutions call out to external templates in locations where the HTML &quot;should be&quot;.",1374742311

If you get enough of this, you would die  of hyperthermia, or abnormally high body temperature<p>For the air to actually heat your body enough to kill you, you need:<p>* Room temperature that is high enough to kill you (>43 degrees celcius). Any temperature below this -- and the fan helps <i>avoid</i> hyperthermia by averaging out the body temperature with the environment.<p>* You have to be fully dehydrated, otherwise even air hotter than your body will cool you up.<p>* According to <a href=""http://www.currentresults.com/Weather-Extremes/hottest-cities-in-the-world.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.currentresults.com/Weather-Extremes/hottest-citie...</a> you won&#x27;t find any place in the world where the <i>night time</i> temperature is well above 30 degrees, so Fan Death is a total myth.<p>* According to <a href=""http://www.mherrera.org/temp.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mherrera.org/temp.htm</a> no place in Korea ever exceeded 40.3 celsius degrees between 2002 and 2012. So if you slept with a fan, during the hottest day of the hottest city in Korea, you&#x27;d still not be hot enough to be killed.<p>If you sleep on on <i>extremely</i> hot <i>days</i> (not nights), with (>43C) a fan directly aimed at you may <i>increase</i> the risk of hyperthermia (which exists anyway). However, on any day with more than 36 degrees Celsius, you are unlikely to leave a fan directed at you, because it will feel warmer than without the fan.<p>In short, it is a silly urban legend, more likely to cause hyperthermia in people who are afraid to use fans to lower their temperatures during the night.",1374741661

As long as a ticket gets sold, they don&#x27;t care. Screw the fans.<p>Everything I&#x27;ve seen trying to explain the scalping phenomenon appeals to the idea that this is completely backwards from true.  Specifically, the theory is that the venue&#x27;s incentive is to fill seats, which is why tickets are so dramatically underpriced (price too low -> shortage of seats -> all seats get filled -> the act appears to be popular).  From the venue&#x27;s perspective, a seat sold to a scalper is a seat they lose money on <i>and</i> that might not be filled during the performance (since the scalper&#x27;s incentive is to charge a realistic price), which is a double loss to the venue.<p>In sum, selling tickets to scalpers gets the venues an amount of money they don&#x27;t want (they were guaranteed to sell out anyway), in order to generate an effect they don&#x27;t want (some seats will be empty during the performance).

Things like the /etc/default RUN=&quot;no&quot; aren&#x27;t the package maintainer trying to be clever, but rather them following Debian packaging guidelines.  There also the reason you see things like MySQL listening only on the loopback interface by default on Debian.<p>One you understand this the decisions seem a bit less crazy.<p>For me, the big issue with the Debian approach isn&#x27;t on installation, but rather on upgrade.  On Debian, running &#x27;apt-get upgrade&#x27; on a live server can cause an unspecified amount of downtime.  If you&#x27;re upgrading MySQL, MySQL will get restarted.  If you&#x27;re upgrading a library on which multiple daemons rely, they will also get restarted.  yum upgrade on RHEL doesn&#x27;t suffer from the same problem, and you can schedule the restart yourself.<p>Again, this is because of a philosophical difference.  On Debian, the idea is that if you&#x27;ve asked to upgrade something, it should be upgraded.  On RHEL, you can upgrade a package, but continue to run the old (potentially insecure version).",1374739911

Indeed, Switzerland has exactly that: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_Federal_Constitution"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_Federal_Constitution</a><p>The main argument against, as I see it, is the lack of accountability, the prime example being California demanding more spending and lower taxes at the same time. Of course, indirect democracy has done very little to prevent that either.<p>When Switzerland doesn&#x27;t pass laws similar to California&#x27;s, I think it&#x27;s because they have a much more homogenous society where there is simply a large degree of agreement on how things should be done - and so, the remaining bits lend themselves well to be decided by direct democracy.<p>That&#x27;s also my response to the GP: no, no amount of interwebs and technology can turn a large and diverse population that disagrees fundamentally on many important issues into a small and homogenous one that agrees on most things.",1374739218

He made two distinct statements that you somehow connected.<p>1) I have not met Hitler but I know him to have been not a nice man<p>2) I believe Patent Trolling to be evil and therefore those that perpetrate it to also be evil.<p>Personally I cannot disagree with either statement. Excusing any evil practice as &#x27;a businessman whose tactics you disapprove of and consider to be unethical&#x27; is also wrong in my opinion.<p>The world of business hides too many organisations (and therefore people) guilty of profound immorality. It has become an unfortunate part of our culture that we so often forgive them as &#x27;just business&#x27;. Capitalism, as a whole, rarely scrapes above amoral.<p>The word &#x27;evil&#x27; has an ancient meaning that doesn&#x27;t only include mass murder and it certainly includes extortion.",1374739203

9390056,comment,9389049,9389049,0,0,carapace,,,"Hey.  I was the fifth employee at Etsy.  It was the three co-founders, a guy in Arizona (or was it New Mexico) doing Flash, then me.  It was pretty a weird and wild ride.<p>I was hired to write the Etsy Middle Layer &quot;Emid&quot; server.  They told me at one point that they were arguing about being able to find python developers and one of them went on Craigslist to settle it and mine was the first resume they saw.  (That was personally kind of a let down.  I just got lucky.) We had a phone interview.  I mentioned that I used Dvorak and that clinched it.  I worked from home for months before ever meeting the others.<p>The &quot;emid&quot; server was pointless: nearly three hundred api calls and fully 80% of them were bodyless wrappers.  Just a decorator that did the real work, the function def, and a docstring to please the syntax (could have used a pass statement.)  All the real &quot;business logic&quot;  was in stored procedures in the DB.  Yes, the DB was constantly on fire as we scaled up (our numbers were mind-blowing the whole time I was there.  Up, up, up, and accelerating.)  The idea was that emid would sit between the web servers and the db and provide some caching and other scaling support, but we never effectively used it.  We actually did not turn on the caching until the investors forced an outside tech consultant on us to try to get some management of the horrible scaling fires that were constantly happening.  So emid just sat there consuming resources.  It had one good use though: when the system messed up (because the DB was almost-literally on fire) the ops/dba dude could complain to the CEO about &quot;the emid problem&quot; and pass the buck.<p>There&#x27;s a lot of stories I could tell, but I don&#x27;t want to &quot;talk trash&quot;.  Overall the users LOVED us and that&#x27;s what really counts, eh?<p>Also, for what it&#x27;s worth, the whole &quot;Etsy was born in 2005 in a Brooklyn loft as a way for one of its co-founders to sell his handmade wooden goods.&quot; story, although it sounds great, is B.S. as far as I know.  The original three were pretty close with the info (I do NOT know what &quot;Etsy&quot; stands for or means, don&#x27;t ask) but they did let it drop that they had picked up the site from someone else who had originally made it but didn&#x27;t want to do anything with it.  Certainly the original three are responsible for it taking off like it did, them and dumb luck.<p>One highlight was that I got to work with Glyph (of Twisted networking engine fame, now at Apple I believe.)  He was a class act and I learned a lot from him.  I got to watch over his shoulder as he implemented a Twisted client for memcache. Woo!<p>Final take away:  you can get away with ALL KINDS of crazy B.S. when you&#x27;re sitting in a fire-hydrant of money.<p>(And how much would anyone reading this like to bet me that I&#x27;ll never see a penny from the IPO?  Please?  It&#x27;s the only way I&#x27;ll make anything from being involved in this weird and wonderful enterprise)",1429210578

I don&#x27;t buy the argument that Verilog isn&#x27;t a programming language - there are still plenty of software principles that apply to a HDL and we should take advantage of those.  There are interesting differences to software - we&#x27;re used to sequential software being easy and parallelizing it being hard.  In a HDL, parallel is easy but sequential logic is much harder requiring state machines.  Writing testable software was historically hard, but test cases cheap.  It is easy to write a testable Verilog module, but fairly expensive to write test cases compared to software.<p>Software tools are also way ahead of FPGA tools.

9390045,comment,9388751,9388751,0,0,varelse,,,"Right now, FPGAs deliver slightly better perf/W than GPUs, but significantly inferior FP32 performance.  That said, they do shine for simple embarrassingly parallel tasks assuming the task does not require FP32 operations.  A good example here is bitcoin mining.<p>That changes this year with the release of Altera&#x27;s Arria 10, which comes with 1.3 TFLOPS of hardcoded FP32 math units.  The other gamechanger is the ability to write kernels in OpenCL rather than VHDL.<p>However, the build time for OpenCL on FPGAs is still many hours compared to tens of seconds for GPUs so my guess is that GPUs will remain the development platform for FPGA code for the foreseeable future, occasionally deploying to FPGA on a daily basis or so.<p>Drifting a little off-topic, the SDKS and libraries for all the accelerators should be free.

9390042,comment,9388176,9389761,0,0,derefr,,,"My (unsupported) hypothesis is that the causative agents behind <i>chronic</i> idiopathic illnesses obey a power law: that there should be one treatment that will help an extremely large percentage of people (greater than 30%, say) that should be a &quot;first-line idiopathic treatment regime&quot;, and then another treatment that covers another 10%, and then a rapid decline into a long tail of interventions that will only help a few percent of people each.<p>I say this because the causes of idiopathic diseases, when revealed, seem to be similar in structure to the causes of idiopathically failing companies, or idiopathically broken computers, or idiopathically recidivist criminals: namely, that there is some obvious-after-the-fact property of the environment, which combines with a person who never learned how to deal with/be hygienic in the case of/avoid that property. Computers choke on dust; criminals have friends/family who are in debt and need money; companies hire workers based on status rather than efficacy. None of the subjects of these forces realize that they need to do something about them (clean the computer; get their family to declare bankruptcy; give objective tests to their workers), so they get worse and worse until someone who actually knows enough about their life, while also not being immersed in the subculture that is missing the hygienic knowledge, comes along and helps them.<p>For the case of criminals (and bad parents), this is the job of social workers. For dentistry, you&#x27;ve got dental hygienists. But who is supposed to teach people how to avoid fungal infections, if it&#x27;s not part of their implicit cultural package of knowledge? Who&#x27;s supposed to teach them why they should care about the effects of their diet on their blood pressure, if hey have no family history of hypertension? Etc.<p>And because of that gap in cultural hygiene-knowledge transmission, I have a strong feeling that a few interventions that directly target the knowledge gaps equivalent to &quot;have you tried blowing compressed air into the computer&#x27;s vent?&quot; Would have an extremely outsized impact in these cases.",1429210438

For example, people who have known me for years know my irc name is bratsche, but newer people have trouble finding me on irc.<p>We&#x27;re using Slack now and this is not an issue. The search capabilities are nice occasionally, although when I was trying to search yesterday through a private conversation history it only gave me results from public rooms so I finally just had to scroll up a few days to find what I was looking for. Bookmarks/stars are a really nice, simple feature that is incredibly useful though. If someone says something and you think you&#x27;re going to need to come back to that, just bookmark it right there. I remember years ago having conversations on irc and either copy/pasting into notes files or even taking screenshots of the window so I could come back to it. :)",1429210285

It&#x27;s convenient to be able to copy an entire _something_ without worrying about the sound card trying to DMA into it (and any hardware-specific details to make that possible).<p>The difference here is that with something like jackd (similar conceptually to CoreAudio or ASIO) there is just the hardware buffer in the kernel and the user buffer in jack which can be basically &quot;shared&quot; by all jack-enabled apps without additional copying on the user-space side. On the other hand you can&#x27;t do sample-rate conversion and per-app volume control with something like that.<p>But if you&#x27;re doing audio software you&#x27;re not worrying if flash is too loud and Skype is too soft. It&#x27;s a whole-system thing enabled by the software and all the buffers and latency are being managed there.",1429209717

So, while it would be difficult to change the blockchain of bitcoin because its widely distributed and computationally expensive, it wouldn&#x27;t be too hard to do it to git.<p>Process would be something like:
-- Take the original chain.
-- Identify a patch in the past where you want to insert the code
-- Check out back to that patch
-- Make the change
-- Roll forward with all the following patches re-applied (with new hashes of course)
-- Replace the repo with the new repo.<p>The end result is that hashes would change.  So if you were talking to people about a particular patch using its hash, or telling people a particular release is set at a particular hash, you would notice when this changes.  So it wouldn&#x27;t be invisible using this method.<p>An alternative approach might be to generate a series of innocuous code changes that will produce the end result of restoring the hashes of the latest commit to what they should have been before the change.

So literature enormously expands our vocabulary, allowing us to use quotes as &quot;pointers&quot; to ideas much larger than anything we could state briefly.<p>Humpty is a great story: <a href=""http://sabian.org/looking_glass6.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sabian.org/looking_glass6.php</a>, it&#x27;s a wonderful exploration of meaning and usage.<p>But I&#x27;ll unpack some of here.<p>Here&#x27;s the lead up to the quote I gave:<p>&quot;[Humpty said:] As I was saying, that seems to be done right — though I haven&#x27;t time to look it over thoroughly just now — and that shows that there are three hundred and sixty-four days when you might get un-birthday presents —&#x27;<p>&#x27;Certainly,&#x27; said Alice.<p>&#x27;And only one for birthday presents, you know. There&#x27;s glory for you!&#x27;<p>&#x27;I don&#x27;t know what you mean by &quot;glory&quot;,&#x27; Alice said.<p>Humpty Dumpty smiled contemptuously. &#x27;Of course you don&#x27;t — till I tell you. I meant &quot;there&#x27;s a nice knock-down argument for you!&quot;&#x27;
&#x27;But &quot;glory&quot; doesn&#x27;t mean &quot;a nice knock-down argument&quot;,&#x27; Alice objected.&quot;<p>I think it is clear that Humpty&#x27;s meaning was quite obvious, and Alice&#x27;s complaint a bit dense.  But while Humpty insists that he must tell Alice what he means, we can see that he needn&#x27;t.<p>Of course, this word commanding business is as dangerous as you note, and Lewis Carroll is on the case:<p>&quot;Alice was too much puzzled to say anything; so after a minute Humpty Dumpty began again. &#x27;They&#x27;ve a temper, some of them — particularly verbs: they&#x27;re the proudest — adjectives you can do anything with, but not verbs — however, I can manage the whole lot of them! Impenetrability! That&#x27;s what I say!&#x27;<p>&#x27;Would you tell me please,&#x27; said Alice, &#x27;what that means?&#x27;<p>&#x27;Now you talk like a reasonable child,&#x27; said Humpty Dumpty, looking very much pleased. &#x27;I meant by &quot;impenetrability&quot; that we&#x27;ve had enough of that subject, and it would be just as well if you&#x27;d mention what you mean to do next, as I suppose you don&#x27;t mean to stop here all the rest of your life.&#x27;<p>&#x27;That&#x27;s a great deal to make one word mean,&#x27; Alice said in a thoughtful tone.<p>&#x27;When I make a word do a lot of work like that,&#x27; said Humpty Dumpty, &#x27;I always pay it extra.&#x27;&quot;<p>On the one hand, words can have many meanings, and any particular meaning must in part be taken from context.  On the other hand, if we just try to _impose_ a meaning on a word, we defeat all communication, and make ourselves ridiculous to boot.",1429209144

I think it lacked something that made it interesting, but also HipChat was somewhat foisted on me initially.<p>That&#x27;s the TL;DR; - here is a story which may give you no more information than that:<p>I was working out of AlleyNYC when HipChat was getting big and they started using it internally and told all their companies that they needed to get on HipChat so they could get door/package notifications, announcements and talk to the staff... &quot;by the way, it&#x27;s awesome!&quot;.<p>We installed it, setup our accounts and the whole nine yards, but can&#x27;t remember any point where I found HipChat showing me any value over Google Hangouts.<p>When one of my colleagues mentioned Slack (weeks later) it was very casual and when I signed up I found lots of interesting things readily available to me that I hadn&#x27;t found other places (integrations, style, notifications, slick mobile apps, etc.).<p>Now, that&#x27;s my subjective experience... was I in a bad mood that day I was told I needed to use HipChat and din&#x27;t like being told what to do?  What I in a particular good and open mood when Slack happened to be mentioned?  If this had happened the other way around would I be a HipChat user?<p>I have no idea... my hunch is that the Slack style interested me more and that their startup tutorial presented their value more plainly and obviously than HipChat - but it could be as simple as the different context that I was exposed to them in.",1429208685

But, no, it is not a silver bullet.<p>The couple of things that I really like about it:<p>- it&#x27;s good for collaborative working or editing - got a fire going?  about to push code live?  Get all the relevant parties in a chat room and talk through it, and then destroy it afterwards<p>- the integrations - for automated systems, slack messages are far less disruptive than emails<p>- the indexing/searching of documents + chats - game-changer for finding that slide deck someone talked about a month ago<p>> So I now need to scroll through screens of idle chatter to try and figure out what some other team is doing?<p>It&#x27;s not great for teams updating other teams on what&#x27;s happening, we have our own home-grown system for that.  It would be very useful if you could have an announcement-only channel, where you could specify the people who have the ability to post, and others cna listen, but they don&#x27;t have that.<p>> Is this constantly pinging me while I&#x27;m trying to work?<p>It&#x27;s configurable, but it has twitter- and irc-style mentions, so you can set your client to only ping you when you get specifically mentioned or something is posted in a critical channel<p>> Will every conversation descend into bikeshedding as every man and his dog wants to offer his opinion on the new logo or product feature?<p>It&#x27;s possible, I guess, but the structure is such that you end up with channels that are <i>important</i> and those that are just <i>interesting</i>.  Important channels you monitor throughout the day, interesting ones you check twice a day.<p>For us, all the product-related channels I monitor as much as possible.  Sales- and marketing-related channels, I maybe check sporadically<p>That being said we are also heavy users of small private groups to keep things focused for specific scenarios.<p>It&#x27;s not magical, but Slack is a very well executed product.

It&#x27;s IRC rooms and direct messages with persistent state across devices and support for pasting images and files.<p>HipChat does have a native Windows client, but it&#x27;s months behind the OS X version, doesn&#x27;t work with touchscreens and has known issues that take months to get fixed. I generally end up using a Chrome wrapper on their web client, which is how Slack does multiplatform anyway. Not a great solution (Chrome has a tendency to pop the software keyboard up all the time, even when you have one plugged in), but it works. If you&#x27;re an OS X shop, the native clients may be a plus for HipChat.<p>As far as functionality goes, one feature that (AFAIK) is missing from HipChat is the ability to log in to multiple organizations. If you use it at work and at home, you&#x27;ll be logging out and in on every device every time you want to change modes. One of my side project HipChatters uses it for his day job and has this issue. Slack&#x27;s client lets you sign in to multiple teams (haven&#x27;t tried it, but I see it in the menu).<p>I&#x27;ve spent much more time in HipChat, so I&#x27;ve experienced a lot more random issues there. Stuff like several hours of chat history being skipped when I scroll up (fixed by relaunch if you notice it happened), constant failures to reconnect after waking from sleep (again, fixed by relaunching), phone notifications popping up for every message even though you&#x27;re currently <i>in</i> the chatroom on your phone having a conversation with someone, etc. It&#x27;s possible that Slack has similar bugginess that I would have hit if I used it as much as I use HipChat, but I don&#x27;t have enough time in it to say.",1429208515

It cannot be any other way.  We know from Godel that no logical system can be consistent _and_ complete, so the use any human language must either admit violations of principle or accept limitations on what can be said in that language.  It is the quality and success of the expression, not its compliance with grammatical rules, by which we judge expressions.  The tests are &quot;do you know what is meant&quot; and &quot;could it be said better&quot;, not &quot;is it grammatical&quot;.<p>There are, therefore, no hard and fast authorities on English usage.  English has principles and precedents, but not rules, and good writing is that which uses or violates those principles to communicate effectively.  Shakespeare isn&#x27;t an authority on usage, he&#x27;s a compendium of examples of how usage can be harnessed for expression.<p>Now following those principles, and leveraging the readers&#x27; understanding and usage of them, allows far more expressive sentences.  Gibbon writes enormous sentences that are clear as water and more efficient than any possible revision.  Lincoln, by mastery of grammar, was able to express himself both powerfully and precisely.  But the rules are in the service of expression, and good writers depart them when they don&#x27;t permit the expression of what they want to say.<p>Complaints about the &quot;mistakes&quot; of great authors are generally mistakes about what the other meant to say, or insistence on some compliance that would damage brevity or power or nuance without adding any clarity.  On ten minutes googling Devlin, I couldn&#x27;t find a single &quot;mistake&quot; whose correction would clearly improve the sentence.  Several of his examples miss the point, or weaken the sentence.<p>But if you want an authority, go to C.S. Lewis:<p>&quot;About amn&#x27;t I, aren&#x27;t I and am I not, of course there are no right or wrong answers about language in the sense in which there are right and wrong answers in Arithmetic. . . .  Don&#x27;t take any notice of teachers and textbooks in such matters. Nor of logic.

Public schools are run by legislatures and school boards and the like, typically being reviewed by annual-at-best election (with crap turnout, for races that few will actually follow, and many of the advantages of incumbency available. The decision-makers are not incentivized to care very much about the quality of their decisions.<p>Moreover, they&#x27;re probably the only employers in the county (maybe the whole state) and the entire business has ultra-long highly-scheduled hiring cycles -- none of this &quot;can you start tomorrow?&quot; business like you get in tech.<p>That is a recipe whereby good performance is not linked to good pay <i>at all</i> and has very high potential for abuse. Would you trust someone employed by that sort of a bureaucracy to evaluate your performance at your job? I&#x27;d prefer not to, myself.<p>So there are a few ways to approach this. Teachers could just sit there and take it -- you can understand why they don&#x27;t care to do so, surely. We could structure the system to have a lot of objective evaluations to curb abuses -- an approach still fraught with many issues (standardized tests and certificates which fail to capture many of the most important aspects of pedagogy). As a final set of options, we could either try to ameliorate some of the worst of all this by restructuring the system to have more options and employers for teachers (charter schools, private schools, etc), or we could double down on the status quo while avoiding any evaluations on teaching whatsoever, leaving failing schools in place to ruin the lives of entire generations of students (blaming either Funding or Parents).<p>It is mostly in the choice of the last option over the penultimate option that there is a major problem -- teachers&#x27; unions paying dues to spend on the election cycle to elect union-friendly politicians. This means that the right sort of incumbent essentially gets to spend tax money on his own campaign, and it goes downhill from there into an orgy of corruption, power games, and detachment from responsibility -- aka &quot;politics&quot;.",1429207495

There&#x27;s no reason you can&#x27;t use a full-fledged programming language like Python to specify your hardware with the strict HDL subset at the RT Level, then use the full language&#x27;s power to test it off-FPGA, and use all the software tooling around your full language to make the whole experience as pleasant as possible.

About half of the estimates indicate we have already achieved the capability (in the form of the top supercomputer, not necessarily in the form of a sub-$1000 computer).<p>I should point out the accepted answer in particular. I have spent some time on the RIKEN simulation story (1 second of activity of 1% of human brain took 40 minutes on a 10 petaflops RIKEN supercomputer) in the past and I&#x27;m beginning to believe it&#x27;s nothing more than a marketing gimmick:<p>- They never released a comprehensive scientific paper, detailing the methods they used.<p>- 1% refers to ~1.73 billion neurons, which is really 2% of the whole CNS (~86 billion neurons). But calling the whole CNS human brain is nonsense. The brain only has about ~19-23 billion neurons. So in reality it was ~10% of human brain.<p>- &#x27;Simulation&#x27; could have vastly different definitions, and associated computational complexities. If they were solving differential equations of human brain&#x27;s biochemistry then I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised it took 40 minutes to simulate 1 second of activity of 1.73 billion neurons. But that is computationally expensive, and a wasteful way of doing brain simulation, because we&#x27;re mostly concerned with the information-processing nature of the neurons, not their biochemistry.<p>Furthermore:<p>The top supercomputer as of today, Tianhe-2, is almost two years old. Do you know how much it costs today to buy GPUs worth 33 petaflops? AMD&#x27;s R9 290X is a 6 teraflop GPU costing $250. You do the math. (Hint: It&#x27;s less than $1.5 million! Tianhe-2 was a $390 million project, Titan $97 million at ~18 petaflops).<p>Finally:<p>If you plan to run a dedicated piece of software on your hardware, FPGA blows GPU out of the water, and an ASIC blows FPGA out of the water. If someone today implements a deep learning system (just giving an example, not claiming it&#x27;s the end-all-be-all of strong AI) on an ASIC, I wouldn&#x27;t be suprised if one such card performs equivalent of between 100 and 1000 teraflops of a GPU&#x27;s performance.<p>And I&#x27;m talking about 28nm process. 22nm would only sweeten the deal.<p>So yes, Moore&#x27;s law has been a great help in its leg in the &quot;relay race&quot; lasting ~50 years. Now it&#x27;s time to pass the baton to the next leg, optimize the architecture and put some strong AI software in it.",1429207357

From there it goes into weird accusations like that people call Scheme a Lisp to defame Common Lisp (WTF?). They also say stuff like &quot;Lisp and Scheme parted ways&quot; which is just ignorant of the fact that &quot;Lisp&quot; in that context means &quot;Common Lisp&quot; and most people saying &quot;Scheme is a Lisp&quot; are basically talking about languages inspired by McCarthy&#x27;s Lisp. But instead of making this reasonable counterargument, people start arguing that Scheme has a lot of similarities to Lisp (meaning Common Lisp).<p>And that link is one of the more intelligent debates on the subject. It&#x27;s a long-running debate and most places I&#x27;ve seen it discussed are even more confused.<p>I just can&#x27;t be arsed to give a fuck. Usually when I&#x27;m talking about Common Lisp I say &quot;Common Lisp&quot; because I value actual clear communication over saving six characters.

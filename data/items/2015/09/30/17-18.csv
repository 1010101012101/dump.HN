I too have seen numerous occasions where something installed via Windows Update has taken out a machine and required significant action to restore it to normal functionality. My personal policy has long been security updates only, and even then I tend to do a quick web search before letting them install, which has saved me from the odd howler in the past.<p>On the other hand, the number of times I have seen a PC rendered inoperable or compromised because it <i>didn&#x27;t</i> install a Windows update within 24 hours of the update being available is zero. Even if the PC is just a simple home machine, there&#x27;s probably still at least some sort of firewall/router between it and the public internet, and just about any device like that is going to block unsolicited incoming traffic by default these days. To get compromised within that time frame you&#x27;d likely have to actively open something or visit somewhere that included an exploit for a new vulnerability, and while that is always a risk even on a fully patched system, it&#x27;s not a big one for most people.",1443635819

But other people’s minds, over in the peon lounge (or at the bus stop), can be ­treated as a resource — a standing reserve of purchasing power.”<p>This is a perfect example of the problem with advertising. It&#x27;s not that people don&#x27;t want to know about products, it&#x27;s that people need to be able to learn about products on their own terms.

Advertising is possibly the greatest sink of time and energy in our generation.

Also, having been on the road with 50+ Teslas, I can assure you that the speed of the vehicle absolutely does not matter, because they don&#x27;t use it. Anecdotal, sure, but there&#x27;s always a bragging rights speed metric to brag about, which means it&#x27;s not really worth bragging about.<p>So basically on the last point you agree with my premise, that Tesla likes to pick terms to hype itself along the lines of Apple and how &quot;revolutionary&quot; their products are.

For the past few years I have been teaching a programming course to small groups of beginning students, generally no more than 15.  The goal is teach them the basics over the course of a semester, and we usually get there.  The only downside is that it takes me about 30 minutes to review each assignment (there are two a week) and write feedback to the student.  With 15 hours of grading a week, it seems hard to imagine teaching much bigger sections.<p>I went to a small college, so my programming courses were typically about the same size, 10-20 students.  How do larger sections work in terms of getting feedback from professors?  It seems critical, especially early on, to be able to understand the way students are trying to solve problems and then give them guidance how to get there.

If I was just writing a REST API, then Dropwizard [4].<p>The reason I would not choose Spring despite the fact that it is better now than it was 10 years ago is because it still approaches things with the wrong mindset, IMO. The reason JVM technologies are so loathed is because of the stupid, pointless complexity that&#x27;s so pervasive, where Spring is/was the poster-child. Building generation after generation of newer APIs on top of the old stuff doesn&#x27;t remove the fact that the old stuff is still there. Hiding complexity with code generation doesn&#x27;t remove the fact that code still needs to be generated. And the same with annotation driven programming. And JPA/Hibernate/etc.<p>Simplicity isn&#x27;t about hiding mountains of legacy complexity under a shiny new API, or annotations, or code gen - it&#x27;s about having a stack that is understandable and easy to use from top to bottom without requiring magician&#x27;s toolbag of tricks to hide the complexity. I get the feeling that most JVM developers don&#x27;t even know what this looks like - Dropwizard is a great example. Other languages/ecosystems tend to not have this legacy baggage, so you can&#x27;t blame their developers for thinking that the mainstream JVM frameworks are ridiculous.

Are we all so sure that every engineer who works with this code really knows, ex ante, <i>all</i> of the effects their changes might have down the line?<p>There are a lot of demands for criminal liability in this thread, but I&#x27;d suggest we proceed carefully.  While it certainly looks suspicious, there are a lot of ways that weird behavior can creep into software that don&#x27;t involve malicious intent.<p>Look at it this way: could Volkswagen engineers conceivably have written code that caused the system to fail all emissions tests all the time?

I don&#x27;t know Greek tax laws, but in the U.S., if you earn less than (iirc) $600/year from one source, you do not need to report it on your taxes. If you earn more than that, even from barter, you do need to report. A lot of people will not, a lot of people won&#x27;t even realize they should, but at least in this country, you are supposed to.<p>If you are using an online service for this, there are records. That makes it easier to report or to be caught if you didn&#x27;t report. So I am not going to automatically assume that all people engaging in barter a) need to report it (maybe they are below the reporting threshold) or b) won&#x27;t report it.<p>Also, given that you can only get 420 Euros/week out of the bank, it looks to me like the main thing barter is doing is getting around that bottleneck. These transactions would not be happening at all without barter. So while in some sense, yes, it may make it easy to skirt around the question of taxes, it is not like it is some tax loophole and people are doing this to actively hide profits. They are doing it because they straight up do not have access to enough money to get their needs met.<p>Perhaps over time the tax issue will get worked out. Perhaps not.

Having skipped over the second amendment for a long time because I thought it was boring, I have a fairly recent bit of study to recall from.  For context, I always believed (basically) as the ACLU does that the second amendment was a collective right, and that regulations were good, necessary, and all that jazz.  It wasn&#x27;t until studying the previous drafts of it, alongside Madison&#x27;s other lost amendments, going through the Federalist Papers, Madison & Hamilton&#x27;s archived documents, et al, that I arrived at the contrary conclusion -- the second amendment is an individual right that even the existing regulations for it are probably counter-Constitutional.<p>> Do you think that this fits in with the role of the constitution necessarily?<p>Not per the original Constitution, but as of the Sixteenth amendment, it decidedly is.  That said, I don&#x27;t believe that it was <i>intended</i> for our nation by its founders, but that&#x27;s why the Constitution is indeed a living, breathing document, and amendment is the cure for whatever ails it.  Looping back around to the second amendment, if &quot;the people&quot; believe that the second amendment is more harmful than beneficial, then the remedy isn&#x27;t to violate the Constitution by infringing the right through laws, but to amend the Constitution to modify or repeal the second amendment.  It takes a lot to get there in terms of popular support, but if there&#x27;s a high bar to eliminating rights of others, that&#x27;s a feature, not a bug.<p>> Does it even have to for it to be obvious that it&#x27;s a good idea that the founders didn&#x27;t codify into the constitution because it was so foreign a concept to them at the time?<p>So, there are many policies that I think are &quot;good ideas&quot; that are unconstitutional.  I can make an acrobatic argument in support of public defender, but in simply dealing with negatively asserted liberties (as the Constitution enumerates) vs. positively asserted liberties (which a public defender is, and which the Constitution doesn&#x27;t espouse), it&#x27;s not terribly well founded.  Personally speaking, I am glad that public defenders exist, and I am glad that there&#x27;s a state-funded barrier to due process punishments imposed by the state, and I think that it is overall a net good... but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s terribly Constitutional, barring amendment.<p>That was kind of a non-sequitur, but to answer the question of whether or not I think it&#x27;s appropriate for the federal government to intervene, that answer is predicated largely more on &#x27;HOW&#x27; they might intervene than whether it&#x27;s a good idea or not.  It very probably is a good idea, and there are likely ways in which the federal government is empowered by the sixteenth amendment that are constitutionally sound, but there are many other ways in which we bolster our least performant states that are not necessarily Constitutional, even barring the sixteenth, which does not completely override the limitations imposed by Article I, Section 8 without a dramatically liberal reading of &quot;General Welfare&quot;.<p>In short, it&#x27;s very complicated, and you can usually pick out the other students of law in public forum by the nuance of their arguments.  I think that publicly funded health care is a good idea, but I don&#x27;t like the way it&#x27;s implemented, and object vehemently to the individual mandate, irrespective of everything else.  Similarly, I understand the conservative objections to the civil rights act, which clearly did objective good, but also included a rather subtle power grab that has largely contributed to our abundant prison populations to which I object.   Life is complicated.  The Constitution is complicated.  And even where we can divine objective truths from it, there still exists a myriad possibilities of subjective application, which could all be truthy.",1443633098

Bill, in presenting IBM a DOS he essentially bought off the shelf, posited the entire enterprise as 'a deal' to be struck.  <p>What OSX and Linux both present is a vision, an ideal of how things should be.   That ultimately is what is absent in Redmond.<p>",1176062290

Iocaine Power finished 3rd later on, losing to its derivative, Greenberg.  The year the article links to, you'll see that Josh from del.icio.us also entered his own bot in the contest, but didn't do nearly as well.<p>I wonder what the properties of the iterated roshambo is, and whether it applies to cooperation (or aggression in this case).  I know that bittorrent uses Tit-for-tat for cooperation amongst its clients.  ",1176060947

10487,comment,10487,9770,0,0,nuke,,,"IBM died in exactly the same way. They became a niche player in the market they had a hand in creating... all the way down to the actual hardware (desktop then laptop).  They finally sold their interest in the personal computer market that they said would go nowhere.  Now, Microsoft, with the same attitude towards open source and open standards is suffering the same climb towards obscurity.   Google embraced open standards (POP, SMTP, HTTP, AJAX, Jabber, etc) and actually extended such to amazing utility (check out their stock market tools) and somehow free... the concept that undoes Microsoft.  Microsoft crushed the browser market with ""Free"" IE and Google is crushing Microsoft with free computing.  Do you need MS Vista?  Heck no, just XP with a decent browser (Firefox) and most people are good to go.  Microsoft creates the new terminals of the millennia and Google is the new mainframe.  The king is dead, long live the king.\n",1176059396

I have a text file full of headlines, or copywriting, even though we're not quite at the point to use them just yet. It's mostly for us; I add to the list constantly, attempting to sell the project to myself every time, as if I was a user. When it seems too hard to describe it in such a way, it's a flag suggesting we might want to refocus.",1176059131

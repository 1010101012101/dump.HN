This is something that gets missed really often.<p>However, I think the author completely misses the power of composition.  It&#x27;s usually the best alternative if you want to share code between different types in Go.  I have written many large go programs without ever using the empty interface or typecasting (except of numeric types, where sometimes you need it because go doesn&#x27;t ever do implicit conversions between numeric types.)<p>I agree that the behavior of storing nil in an interface is a wart.<p>The author spends a long time arguing against the idea that the use of sync and atomic should be discouraged.  He claims that it is hypocritical because the standard library uses these packages.  But it doesn&#x27;t seem hypocritical to me to put tricky optimizations into the standard library, but discourage ordinary programmers from writing tricky code in their ordinary applications.  The standard library has millions of users; most code has a handful.  The tradeoffs are going to be different.<p>Besides, the author is arguing against a strawman here.  Go has always given programmers access to low-level programming resources such as inline assembly, operating-system-specific calls, and even the ability to directly make non-portable Linux system calls.  Compare this to Java, where up until very recently, you couldn&#x27;t even create a symlink without using JNI because the authors were afraid it might be non-portable.<p>I think micro-benchmarking the performance of channels misses a lot of the point.  OK so you have a microbenchmark where mutexes are 30% faster than channels in a tight loop-- and you&#x27;re willing to give up all the benefits of channels for that?  Talk about missing the point.  And if your goroutine does anything interesting with what it&#x27;s pulling out of the channel, this is even more irrelevant.",1432711631

Upon detonation at the correct depth it could create a large crater, up to 100ft deep and 80ft across, which was identified as being useful for attacking railway targets and airstrips, as repair of these craters was time consuming. Combined with the specialised bomb sights used by the squadron who dropped the Tallboys, successfully bombing a small target such as a viaduct or railway line was doable.<p>However this bomb wasn&#x27;t used before June &#x27;44, when most of the death camps were closed or closing, and the short supply of Tallboys meant that they were exclusively used for targets of high military importance.<p>1. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tallboy_%28bomb%29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tallboy_%28bomb%29</a>",1432710933

Tell us what&#x27;s ping-pongs you did?<p>3. Even your micro testing Thread busy waiting on cores. The OS still has the right to do thread scheduling. Who gurantees you have not a cache line missing for next time running? This is possible by a relative complex steps in Java. But it is obvoiusly not shown in all of your codes and notes.<p>4. The cache line is not sharing directly. They become coherent by MESI or its variants[2]. You busy waiting causes the coherence storm for RFO, which is expensive in theory. Although some relieve these pain, this is another topic. You need to show these latencies or at least why you do not consider them in the nanosec level?<p>5. if assumed &quot;15 ns in any case without contention&quot; is right, then 1ns for the latency of rest instructions? The cost of above cache coherence? The cost of a function call pro/epi in hotspot-JITed codes? The overhead by volatile of forbidding some JIT? OK, how about counting on GC?<p>6. Ping-pong is still not good enough for nanosec level latency measurement. Because, you have the &quot;endpoint effect&quot;. At least, you need to copy? what&#x27;s the memory copy throughput latency?(note again: latency != 1/throughput)<p>7. Finally, your codes just show the throughput of batch writing/reading into/from memory by Java&#x27;s mmap kinds.

Around the time of my annual review, the founders asked me to move back to their main office in Massachusetts.

We have several Hadiths that have the same meaning: ادرؤوا الحدود بالشبهات (i.e. fend off penalties with suspicion). For the penalty for adultery to hold, there needs to be four witnesses, who witnessed the actual act (not just saw a couple hugging or kissing, for instance). If any one of them decides to change his word after testifying, then the supposed witnesses will be penalized. And for your information, not once did this take place in the history of Islam.

My perspective is one that falls more in line with efforts like the Internet Archive: save it all, wholesale.<p>He mentions technical solutions for enforcing ephemerality, but under the guise of <i>preserving</i> ephemerality.  The problem with this is twofold:<p>Re preserving: The ephemerality guarantee was never there.  I&#x27;ve been watching The Americans.  (Side note: good show.)  If early 1980s Henry or Paige wanted to spend all evening talking on the phone and keep a recorded copy of their conversations, they could have.  Tape recorders existed.  If something interesting was said, and they realized they wanted to keep it on record after the fact, they could have written it in their journals.  The end of ephemerality began long ago, before either the writers of this comment or the linked article were born, and before our Paige and Henry were born into their fictional universe.<p>Re enforcing: This ephemerality guarantee can&#x27;t exist.  The analog hole is inescapable.  If I understand correctly, Snapchat exists to allow expiry of content and even place preconditions on sharing, such as who it can be shared with when using the app&#x27;s own sharing mechanism.  This isn&#x27;t enforcing a standard for ephemerality that has been lost.  It&#x27;s attempting to enforce a standard for ephemerality that never existed; it exploits the properties of digital transmission to <i>synthesize</i> something that doesn&#x27;t and can&#x27;t exist in the analog world.  And failing.  Because the digital world still has to interface with us through our analog one.  So for all the effort that has gone into trying to make Snapchat&#x27;s protections work, those efforts can be circumvented by something as simple as a 10 year old who can operate a camera or just possesses the ability to recount what he or she has seen or heard.<p>&quot;Should the web remember, and should we use a medium that has permanent memory for so much of our business?&quot; are the wrong questions, and trying to answer them is a distraction.",1432710495

You could possibly do it if you were willing to sacrifice half your disk space by pairing every 512-byte data block with a 512-byte authenticator block, but...<p>...the other issue is that you need a way to atomically update the data block and authenticator together.  This is a similar problem to the &quot;RAID write hole&quot;, and doing this at the block layer requires even more overhead - something equivalent to RAID write intent bitmaps.<p>The filesystem, on the other hand, already tends to have a journal, log-structure or COW rules that allows some form of atomic transactional updates.

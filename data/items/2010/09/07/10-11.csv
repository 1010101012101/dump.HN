Yes, it is hard to get ten people to pay money, in that you have to have a mostly-functioning product, a website which markets it, and some way to charge their credit cards.  But this is not really <i>that</i> hard.<p>BCC 1.02 (""Like 1.00, but with less crash bugs and the brand new ability to print to non-default printers"") got to ten customers in six weeks from 1.0's launch, entirely on the strength of organic search marketing on two pieces of content.  That was when I was young and stupid.  Y'all can do better.<p>I think software (let's scope it to B2C software for the moment) is like lemonade stands.  You know how you get ten customers with a lemonade stand?  Your price?  Doesn't really matter.  Your stand's design?  Doesn't really matter.  Your taste?  Doesn't really matter.  Your location?  Probably matters for getting hundreds or thousands of customers, but for 10, pretty much any street will do.  The key hurdle you have to get over is <i>charging money for lemonade</i>.  I am worried that people think it is really really hard to run a successful business, and that stops them from ever charging for lemonade.",1283857061

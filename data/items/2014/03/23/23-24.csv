If the engineering rates where higher, there would be more engineers who would be founders. Engineers would have a larger % of the startup, since non-cash compensation would have to be offered.<p>Also, the artificial deflation caused some engineers to be stuck in a bad job.<p>That&#x27;s why I won&#x27;t be anyone&#x27;s employee.

But this doesn&#x27;t follow:<p>> Maybe if CEO&#x27;s weren&#x27;t illegally conspiring to drive wages below their market value, there wouldn&#x27;t be a so-called &quot;engineer shortage&quot;?<p>What illegally driven-down wages mean is that the shortage is <i>more acute that previously thought</i>. That&#x27;s because the main way to measure the relationship of supply and demand is through price; i.e. the more the salaries grow, the less supply there is relative to demand. So if salaries have been held down, some of that evidence was masked.<p>Secondly, it means that non-giant companies could be competitive in making job offers, whereas perhaps in a more free labor market they might not be able to compete salarywise with Google, Apple, Microsoft, etc. Thus, as seen from say, a startup&#x27;s vantage point, this check on the upward price pressure actually kept the supply of affordable engineers up.<p>So I remain sympathetic to the there-aren&#x27;t-enough-programmers line of thinking, and certainly don&#x27;t think of this as hypocritical or antithetical to that line. Of course, that doesn&#x27;t excuse any of Google&#x27;s behavior here; they&#x27;ve effectively stolen a great deal of money from all of us through illegal collusion, pocketing the money that an honest market would direct into the engineers&#x27; bank accounts.

I think that&#x27;s very unlikely, since software engineers are already paid a great deal more than most fields, so these people are either people who don&#x27;t care about money unless it&#x27;s a <i>lot</i> of money, or they&#x27;re people who instead chose to be doctors and lawyers.

So, if I&#x27;m paying an engineer $100K and Google sees fit to hire them away for $200K then, sure, it&#x27;s in the engineer&#x27;s interest to tell me because then I would need to offer $250K to keep them. And this isn&#x27;t because they have suddenly become more valuable, or because the engineer has suddenly developed new skills, it&#x27;s simply a game of strategy and money that could potentially hurt both businesses.

Gox cold storage wallets were depleted, and the chain of withdraws eventually lead from the cold storage wallets to 1PAzo, then it&#x27;s extremely likely that Jed or an Mt. Gox owner is trading Mt. Gox cold storage coins on Bitstamp.&quot;<p>It sounds like you&#x27;re worried that a chain of transfers doesn&#x27;t prove ownership. For example, someone could randomly send all their bitcoin to someone else for no reason.  But in practice, the only reason to give large amounts of BTC to someone else is either because you&#x27;re buying something from them, repaying a debt, or you&#x27;re cooperating with them.  Regardless of which of those it turns out to be, the Mt. Gox cold storage wallets are the property of the Mt. Gox customers.  Using them to buy something or repay a debt would be fraud.  Transferring them to an associate with the intent of laundering them via Bitstamp would also be illegal, of course.<p>I can&#x27;t think of any other explanations for why the BTC would change ownership except perhaps that they were stolen yet again. But theft can be ruled out if the identity of the Bitstamp account turns out to be a cohort of Mt. Gox.<p>(You mentioned that it could be a mixer, but that can be ruled out in this case because it&#x27;d make no sense for Mt. Gox to launder bitcoins and then deposit them into a bistamp account that has someone&#x27;s real-world identity attached to it.  Also, when bitcoins are being mixed using a mixer, it transfers the coins in a pretty distinctive way that indicates a mixer is being used, such as by randomizing the BTC amounts rather than always transferring e.g. 150BTC or 50BTC or some other nice-for-humans value.  I assume that if a mixer is being used here, it&#x27;d be possible to show that the transfers are behaving in a way consistent with a particular bitcoin mixer implementation.)<p>Since there are no plausible explanations about how the bitcoins might change ownership, why would it be unreasonable to proceed with the assumption that the ownership hasn&#x27;t changed, unless proven otherwise?",1395615863

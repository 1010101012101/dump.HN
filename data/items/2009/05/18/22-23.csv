Typical input lengths that users and programmers are interested in are between 100 and 1,000,000, approximately. Consider an input length of n=100 and a polynomial algorithm whose running time is n^2. This is a typical running time for a polynomial algorithm. (See the ""Objections"" section for a discussion of atypical running times.) The number of steps that it will require, for n=100, is 100^2=10000. A typical CPU will be able to do approximately 109 operations per second (this is extremely simplified). So this algorithm will finish on the order of (10000 ÷109) = .00001 seconds. A running time of .00001 seconds is reasonable, and that's why this is called a practical algorithm. The same algorithm with an input length of 1,000,000 will take on the order of 17 minutes, which is also a reasonable time for most (non-real-time) applications.<p>Meanwhile, an algorithm that runs in exponential time might have a running time of 2^n. The number of operations that it will require, for n=100, is 2^100. It will take (2^100 ÷ 109) ≈ 1.3×1021 seconds, which is (1.3×1021 ÷ 31556926) ≈ 4.1×1013 years. The largest problem this algorithm could solve in a day would have n=46, which seems very small.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobham%27s_thesis"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobham%27s_thesis</a>",1242685855

As Amazon is moving up the stack so are we. We're integrating a lot of the various features and really provide a platform for all the config management, automation, access control, etc. Plus pre-configured stacks that you can fully customize. If you actually try to use Amazon's monitoring and auto-scaling you'll find you have a lot of wheels to reinvent...",1242684649

Worrying about algorithms in the ""mathematical whiz kids"" sense is extremely important when you have to be worried about speed and resources. Take databases, for instance. Their search and compression algorithms are extremely optimized (by mathematical whiz kids), and they yield phenomenal results. If everyone had always been satisfied with a simple, straightforward solution, Google would be devastatingly slow and require an enormous amount of space more than it already does.<p>I've had to look into the efficiency of my algorithms when doing batch processing on massive XML files - I managed to cut run-time by 80% by paying more attention to my algorithm's efficiency.<p>On the other hand, if I'm just sorting 5 entries alphabetically for some table, it's better to implement a quick-and-dirty algorithm that will take an extra 2 milliseconds to compute, than for me to spend half my day worrying about it's efficiency.<p>So generally speaking - people designing low-level systems are very worried about their algorithms, with good reason: If their code is slow or wasteful, their platform can't be used. If you're designing a web app, you'd probably waste more time than it's worth if you delve into that. It's just a question of priorities.",1242684546

As you mature, it is natural to reach the conclusion that life is too short to spend on some people and that there are other, better things that you can do with your time. What you are complaining about is socialising in an environment that for whatever reason, you can't be yourself (in this case, because you can't correct people when they say something obviously wrong, but it could have been any other reason).<p>So don't. Decrease the quantity of your socialising, increase the quality, and spend your time doing something that gives you genuine pleasure, even if it means doing it on your own.",1242684476

The official docs and tutorials are pretty good nowadays, but I can see how the interface itself really doesn't give you many clues. (I was already familiar with hg when I started using git, so I picked it up quite quickly.)<p>Coming up with a newbie-friendly interface has probably been a much, much lower priority than getting the underlying system working well, which is pretty typical of Unix culture.

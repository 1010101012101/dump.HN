It's these details that separate a brilliant user experience from a poor one.<p>Apply may have less features, and it may be less flexible. But it provides a nicer experience, because of these kind of levels of details.

With only 9 months of Python under your belt, it wouldn't be much of a loss if you switched now. Try to get a feel for the Ruby/Rails and Python/Django communities and in which one you'd feel more comfortable participating.<p>To make some sweeping generalisations, Pythonistas tend to be more computer-sciencey than the Ruby crowd, and if you're doing a lot of heavy number crunching, it might be worth checking out SciPy/numpy and whether there are equivalent stacks in Ruby (I have done this research but my gut says there aren't.) OTOH, the sheer size and popularity of RoR means that it's much easier to find work in Ruby/Rails than Python/Django. YMMV.",1348012583

The idea the article was putting forth is that you could use bitcoin scripts to change property ownership<p>The point is you can't, as the article proposes, create a bitcoin scripted loan where if I default on the loan, authorization message/transaction  gets sent (because that message must be signed with a private key that the network does not have) .<p>What you could do, in a world where bitcoin script is far more powerful, is give your bank a transaction that says this transaction is only valid if I didn't pay loan x(where x is some bitcoin contract loan) and if it is valid, then the bank has access to my car.<p>When this transaction validates according to network consensus, the car would hand over control. This requires,however, that the car can make the validity judgment. Which means the car has to understand the bitcoin protocol and probably have access to the transaction records/blocks.",1348012577

I kinda always thought it's just part of how you operate a dishwasher :) First time I opened it right after its cycle, a huge cloud escapes, so it figures that otherwise it would condense, no?<p>Another tip then, I don't just open it a few inches but all the way and pull out both racks. That way all the steam escapes within a few seconds and you can close up the dishwasher again. You do need a bit of ventilation but I just open my balcony door. And then, there's a few cups or glasses that have concave bottoms so they gather a bit of water. If you blow hard on them while everything is still hot, the drops will fly somewhere (it's just water), and those glasses will become fully dry thanks to the last bits of heat.<p>Another tip. If you wrap it up real good so no soap can get to it, you can easily cook a piece of salmon in your dishwasher. It's not a great way (cooks too hot, for too long), but it <i>does</i> work and that's awesome.<p>Another tip. If you got a compartment for a ""shining agent"", you can put a mix of white vinegar and ethanol in it. It works. Both of the substances easily evaporate in the heat so you won't get a vinegar smell or anything (unless you use balsamic--good luck with that). An expensive commercial shining agent might work even better, I never tried them.<p>Yet another tip. Maybe you have a built-in water-softener whose ion-exchanger needs recharging by pouring dishwasher salt into another compartment. The only difference between table salt and this stuff is that the granules are big so it dissolves slower. So, buy big granules table salt instead (the stuff used in table salt grinders), which is much cheaper.<p>Another other tip. You'll probably still do <i>some</i> cleaning by hand, when you need a specific utensil or something. If you use a plastic dishwasher brush, you can put that one in the dishwasher as well to clean it. I'm unsure why, but I find brushes to last a <i>lot</i> longer when I occasionally clean them in the dishwasher.<p>If you can trust your dishwasher to not leave weird residue on your stuff, you can also use this method to clean plastic hair-combs every once in a while.<p>A dishwasher really is a magical device. You can even put some lines of source code in the cutlery rack, and they'll come out with less bugs. True fact.",1348010814

This act would marginally decrease the likelihood that they would, whether it decreases it too little or too much is a legitimate concern.<p>Other industries than software are far more capital intensive. For instance most new drugs are not developed at the same companies that are the best at synthesizing compounds at scale and have the best distribution networks. However, investors assume the risk of funding expensive research, specifically because they know that in the rare case that it is successful, the large companies will buy the property rather than simply make it themselves.<p>The SHIELD Act could very well create a different model where all drug research had to take place under the umbrella of larger corporations that could fund expensive legal fights on short notice.<p>There is an overwhelming presumption that intellectual property is a sham in the software industry.

The furthest grandparent post said that, ""Apple patented a rectangle, and I haven't seen much rise in awareness."" and I've said nothing more than to give the jury's own verdict on three of Apple's design patents.<p>For the second point, I've already said that rounded rectangles are just one part, though the original post by marcoamorales is incorrect insofar as it implies that the design patents cover only that.  It's pretty much inarguable that Apple asserted design patents with rounded corners as a key design feature.

I'm pretty sure this feeling is mostly due to unfamiliarity and not superior design on either side. Although it is worth noting that whenever I've borrowed someone else's Android phone it can be a completely different experience from my own Android device, whereas an iOS user borrowing an iOS device will know exactly how to operate it.",1348009268

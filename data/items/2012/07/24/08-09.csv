Deliverability rates are comparable and at times, higher when compared against Campaign Monitor in our tests when building Sendy.<p>We see high potential in SES, such great quality at such low price. The only drawback is there is no UI for newsletter campaigns. So we built it and hopefully the general public who'd like to send newsletters but aren't too technically inclined (or are too busy to figure) can take advantage of Amazon SES through Sendy.<p>The only reason why it's a one time fee of $40 is because it's self hosted.",1343120212

No aristocrate would ever call oneself ""self-made"" - that's the same as calling oneself an impostor or a fraud. One can be made an aristocrat - e.g. by a royalty - and fresh-minted aristocrats always were considered the lowest form of aristocracy by the ""old"" and ""true"" ones, the length of the family tree always was the main source of aristocratic pride. But one can never be a ""self-made"" aristocrat, it's a direct contradiction in terms and concepts. I'm sorry, but your theory makes no sense at all.",1343119710

4284807,comment,4283948,4284700,8,0,astrodust,,,"Many birds can see ultraviolet, it's fairly common since it seems to allow them to differentiate flowers the same way many insects do. Some flowers look completely different in the UV spectrum (<a href=""http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-473897/A-bees-eye-view-How-insects-flowers-differently-us.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-473897/A-bees...</a>). This is why it's important that many types of pet birds have some natural daylight.<p>As for emotions, that's a harder thing to prove. Dolphins are intelligent enough they should be classified as sentient non-human persons according to more progressive scientists. They have the richest range of emotions we've seen outside of chimpanzees, and to be honest, chimpanzees are so very nearly human it's quite amazing. They don't seem to lack any faculties that humans have, but some of their emotions are just less pronounced or developed.<p>Sometimes it seems the only reason that chimpanzees aren't affected more emotionally is that they don't understand the implications of what's happening. It's just ignorance more than a lack of emotion.<p>What might exist in the way of emotions humans don't have is things that are bio-chemical. Nature has a way of ""rewarding"" behaviors that are productive with a positive feeling. Do cuttlefish feel something other than love when doing their dances? What does an octopus, which has a nervous system entirely unlike a mammal or fish, feel when going about their day?",1343118175

I think it's OK to abbreviate like that when talking about evolution, as long as we're aware we're anthropomorphizing.<p>Note that the definition from Wikipedia that you quoted says nothing about ""survival"". Death isn't even a requirement. You just need a change in the allele frequencies of a population to call it evolution.<p>With that survival line you were probably referring to natural selection, which is just one of the aspects of evolution, and again not a requirement for it. You can have evolution by genetic drift, for example. But even if you were just talking about natural selection, putting the emphasis on survival (and ""nothing but survival"") is incomplete and misleading. Death/survival don't need to play an important role in natural selection (though there are instances when it will, of course). For example, small differences in the average number of offspring already mean natural selection.",1343117898

This is not at all clear to someone without that experience... and if that one big company is how you pay the rent?  well, you have trouble.   (that's another thing I love about having a lot of small customers rather than one big one.   I can be easy about people being late.   When I was a contractor, after the 30 days in the 'net 30' were up, I'd just stay home until they fedex'd me a check.  I felt all weird, because the customer was paying the middleman, it was the middleman that was sitting on the money for 45 days.)<p>Note, I don't think this is because they are trying to save pennies in interest.  They sit on the payments because as long as they owe me money, they have vast power in any sort of dispute.<p>Really, both small companies and big companies need to realize this;   Groupon needs to understand that they are dealing with people that haven't had to wait on corporate payment schedules before, people that often don't have access to short-term credit.  Groupon needs to understand that these people are used to the situation where 'net 30' means 'you will get your money, at the very latest, in 30 days'  -   and Groupon needs to act accordingly, if they want to play in that market.<p>Of course, business owners also need to learn that when you deal with a large corporation, the contracts they write are worth nothing;  if standard procedure is to mail 'net 30' checks 45 days after getting the invoice, they are going to mail 'net 30' checks 45 days after getting the invoice, and there is nothing you can do about it.    If you deal with large companies, you need to keep more operating expenses as available cash/credit than when you are dealing with small companies, and really, you need to have a lot of patience and toleration.<p>(Of course, this is part of why you charge large companies more than you charge small companies.  At the same price? it's simply not worth it to deal with the bullshit.)",1343117426

But some people are happy being at the office from 9 am to 11 pm assuming the ""work day"" includes a multi-hour team lunch break, some random breaks for playing Doom II, Diablo 3 or the newest Battlefield or whatever is hot at the office, lots of slashdotting/redditing/HNing/etc, hours long discussions about what happened on the hot geeky tv show, etc.  So what it comes down to isn't even the workaholics vs the non-workaholics, but the totally tech-focused geeks vs the people who have non-tech things going on in their lives.<p>FWIW, up until my early-mid 30s I was very much the former, so I don't entirely begrudge that lifestyle, but I think it is mostly fantasy that those people are putting in significantly more actual work hours than the other group.

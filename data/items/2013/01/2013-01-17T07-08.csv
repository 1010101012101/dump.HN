It doesn't have to happen very often before the bad press really kicks into gear. This is unfortunate, as lithium is really a pretty good foundation for green energy initiatives like electric cars.<p>If the bad press really gets bad enough even cell phone and laptop batteries could become significantly more bulky and less powerful, just ""for safety.""<p>Lithium cells can explode when overcharged  a tightly controlled charger is a must. (This is most likely what happened on the 787, though no official sources are out yet.)<p>Lithium cells can also catch fire if the cell voltage drops too low. Cell voltage is a measurement of the amount of energy stored in the cell. The wikipedia page is a good place to start, but the practical effect of this is that the cell _must_ have a good regulator at all times!<p>The same regulator circuit can do charging and discharging; that's how cell phones and laptops work.

Throughput per unit power is better.  ARM manufacturers have been optimizing for power consumption and unit cost for a long time, Intel has been optimizing for throughput and speed for a long time.  Both sides are aiming for the same target, from different angles.  A ""low power"" Xeon might be 40W for four cores, but the typical range is 60W - 140W.  Calxeda sells a sixteen-core, 20W ARM board.  By these numbers, Xeon needs to have 8x throughput of the ARM to beat it in throughput per watt.<p>Now, this is not entirely unreasonable.  I've done benchmarking of my Core i5 against my Atom on an audio sample rate conversion library I wrote, and the Core i5 has 6-7x the throughput of the Atom.  So, I would believe you if you said that a Xeon core is more than 8x as fast as an ARM core, and therefore the throughput per watt is better.  This is all guessing, based on one benchmark I did for a library I wrote.  I'm sure that Facebook has done some experiments with the applications they'll actually be running on the ARM.<p>I'm not sure where you get the idea that these ARM computers will be centered around specialized hardware, Calxeda's website only mentions general-purpose hardware built around ARM cores.",1358409386

Pretty much every political innovation, by definition, is unlawful at the time of conception.

And I'm not suggesting the problem is that the action is too drastic.  It's that the action sends the wrong message.  The most likely outcome of Ortiz getting fired is that prosecutors are more cautious about bullying the well-connected; they'll judge each defendant on the likelihood of their martyrdom and act accordingly.  It won't make defending oneself against federal charges any more cheap or accessible; it won't make a prosecutor approach you in a measured way.  And the less powerful defendants are still going to get screwed--which is to say, those who <i>most need</i> federal prosecutors to treat them reasonably and decently.  Firing Ortiz (or, more accurately, Heymann) will just make others more cautious when dealing with the rich and the famous.<p>Prosecutors bully defendants into taking bad plea deals because they're judged on their conviction rate.

5071556,comment,5071001,5071278,4,0,strlen,,,"Err, I think you have a very relevant point, but I think it's not fair to characterize this as either ""order-loving"" or ""anti democracy"".<p>I'll paraphrase Churchill: I think that democracy is horrible, but it's simply the best means we have of protecting individual rights.<p>Furthermore, democracy doesn't mean ""majoritarianism"", it means ""rule of people"". Yet even a simple representative democracy is exceedingly difficult to implement (obvious example is how would one draw district boundaries to ensure fair representation of all groups -- Gerrymandering is a huge problem) as to adequately represent ""the will of the people"". So a lot of people are contending this specific point.<p>I think where I draw the line is in ends vs. means: I strongly care about protecting basic individual rights. Primitive ancestral tribalism means absolute collectivism and zero individual rights (the right to swing one's fist was not limited by where another's nose began), so we've continuously evolved better and better systems to do so including Anglo-American Common Law (which today still provides some of the strongest guarantees of liberty anywhere on Earth).<p>On the other hand, just looking at the judicial history, I see a lot of clever bending of the rules and hacks that got us there: using 14th amendment to apply first amendment to defend highly unpopular speech was both ""anti-democratic"" and contrary to the letter of the law (the first amendment clearly said ""congress shall pass no law""). Likewise, Roe v. Wade was a great judicial hack (use of 9th and 14th amendment to defend another activity most everyone opposed) that significantly expanded women's reproductive freedom.<p>These kind of ""hacks"" even made the idea of law entertaining to me (when fresh out of undergrad, I was being prepared for deposition in some IP litigation I got dragged to as a result of an internship I had, the counsel seriously urged me to consider law school instead of MS in CSE). However, I knew that realistically my choices would be either near-starvation or big law (absolutely the wrong place for someone like me, who could never adhere to a strict schedule or a dress code).<p>However, I don't see that ""order loving"" and ""order breaking"" are mutually exclusive: a software engineer is free to work at a firm that requires everyone to be in the office at 9:30 (irrespective of how late they stay until) and many choose to do so (practically all engineer working for financial firms). I don't see an issue with companies choosing this culture, with some reasonable exceptions (e.g., I'm not a laissez-faire absolutist, so I would consider it grossly unjust to fire an engineer for coming at 9:45 because their daughter had a doctor's appointment that morning).<p>While I would abhor forced-collectivism as a political system, I've enjoyed working at smaller ""collectivist"" companies, i.e., where everyone is focused on the same goal (which benefits everyone) rather than on advancing themselves.<p>So where does aaron enter into this? I think to me the part I found morally repugnant that the law that was meant to defend JSTOR (who have dropped the charges and whose rights were not severely transgressed) was aimed disproportionally against Aaron. In other words the state was acting to some concrete end that went far beyond what was reasonable to protect individual rights[1].<p>If the state wanted Aaron to never do this again, clearly stating to Aaron that if this happens again he will go to jail (something that seemed to absolutely deter him) and get a felony on his record (something that, again, would clearly deter him -- in that it would make his goals of social activism much more difficult in terms of difficulty of finding employment, vote or run for office, etc...).<p>Everything else seems superflous, unneeded and disproportionate (if JSTOR pursued the case they would have had a right to some kind of settlement, but not, e.g., forcing Aaron to pay $2 bn or sending him to jail for a decade).<p>What I think energized me even more personally is that his situation is far from unique -- you were also one of the first to point to this out too. However, rather than forgetting about Aaron, the proper response is to further seize on the momentum: Aaron was certainly influential and this influence could be used to change the laws governing prosecutorial conduct. I think (but correct me if I am wrong), you would also agree with me here.<p>Where we disagree (as far as I understand your comments) is just because 51% of people find personal drug use repugnant (or believe cooky theories about it), than they have a free hand at imposing drug laws. My own take being that ""unenumerated"" individual liberties (liberty being defined negatively and circularly as something that doesn't infringe on the liberty of othes) should be restricted if and only if doing so is crucial to protecting the rights of others (e.g., to use an artificial example, if a pain killer happens to make 30% of its users instantly and extremely violent it can be restricted, as long as it is still available under supervised conditions to who can't for one reason or another use another pain killer). More fundamental liberties (those crucial to continuation of liberty itself -- free speech, protection against torture, protection against unreasonable search and seizure) should have an even stricter standard (something similar to the ""clear and present danger"" standard for free speech in the US today). I think it's also close to the fundamental framework most (but not all) HN-ers subscribe to (libertarians and liberals alike), but there is wide disagreement on specifics of how it applies in each individual case (it's clear that an outright ban on marijuana has a zero or negative effect as far protection of fundamental liberties of others goes, but it's a bit more difficult for other drugs). Some might also argue that there is an even more fundamental right to use an entheogen, etc...<p>The libertarian positions tend to be more categorical than the liberal ones (e.g., property is the more right, so taxation is always unjust, even if it's the only way to provide basic healthcare or legal protection for individuals).<p>I am hopefully not caricaturing you, but your argument seems to be that liberties and rights are crucial, but they are granted and limited based on ""greater common good"" analysis as opposed to more categorical statements. I think it's perfectly valid and (often) seems to lead to similar conclusions as the system I use, but the thought process is very different in that a deeper-level happiness of majority (which is usually greatly bolstered by liberty, but not always so), as opposed to liberty itself is your overriding concern (""if a small minority really wants to do X which poses no harm to the majority, but the majority is deeply upset that X is allowed, then it's fine to bring the legal system down full-force on the minority that chooses to do X"").<p>In the end I think these two systems actually converge more often that not: drug war does not serve the common good, for example. Yet, it's the disagreements that can be particularly vehement (such as issue of laws that infringe on individual rights in one way or another, but yet have a clear societal benefit despite not immediately protecting individual rights -- e.g., seatbelt laws, laws regulating food portions, drugs beyond marijuana, certain police practices, etc...)<p>[1] Reasonable people can disagree whether academic publishers have a right to hold papers behind a paywall. I think that's debatable, with my own views being closer to Aaron's. Another example where this is simply hard and reasonable people coming from the same ""first principles"" can disagree.",1358408816

5071532,comment,5070001,5071320,6,0,jonafato,,,"I don't normally take sides in these arguments, but I think you're misunderstanding the economics of this situation. This isn't analogous to file sharing, because file sharing doesn't affect the availability of the original file. Consider these numbers (made up, but probably not wildly inaccurate):<p>- Access costs $10<p>- Total bandwidth available is 5Mbps<p>- 10 users purchase access for an average of .5Mbps per user<p>If 10 more users pay for service, the original 10 are getting half of what they used to for the same price. In response to this (see other comments about ""gouging""), airlines raise the prices of access. This act preserves some minimum level of service for those who are willing to pay.<p>If, instead of the scenario above, the second 10 users go on to use the service without paying, the first are ""cheated"" out of being able to get their minimum acceptable level of service even if they would choose to pay a higher price. When this happens, prices can be set arbitrarily high without having the intended effect of reducing the strain on the network.<p>Based on this logic, I disagree with your analogy to file sharing, but I also agree with you that this is not theft. It's more akin to pollution than anything else. If one chooses to smoke in a bar that doesn't allow smoking, everyone else suffers. In the same vein, if I access this service without paying, all of the paying users really do get less than they're purchasing.<p>The airlines are left with two choices here:<p>1) Plug the hole so this is no longer possible. This is the path they'll choose because it's profitable and it satisfies the already-paying users.<p>2) Open it up for everyone. This is impractical. If you've ever used Wi-Fi on a Bolt or Mega bus, you know that it can be painfully slow. There's no incentive for the provider to upgrade, because they can't profit by doing so.<p>This isn't really about taking from the big, bad corporations. It's about taking from your neighbor. It would be great if we had in-air broadband, but until that day, we'll have to find some way to regulate the use of a limited resource to prevent it from becoming over-saturated.<p>-----<p>Edit: formatting, clarity.",1358408309

The DNS traffic used by the tunnel is quite easy to identify and probably filter out (the names looked up follow a specific pattern).<p>So, there was no need for ISP to get worried. Given how slow access would be and the skill level required to get it to work, it is thousand times cheaper to ignore the ""security hole"".<p>The Google app engine proxy looks more ""useful"".",1358406560

5071472,comment,5068413,5068413,4,0,bobwaycott,,,"Hiring feels broken in many businesses, typically because it is executed by people who do not understand the target position, especially with technology. And, like the author tried to focus on, it doesn't help when the focus is far too heavily on a specific piece of the tech puzzle, and not on the overall talent and aptitude of the candidate her/himself.<p>I've both participated in and executed hiring processes in a mid-size (~500 emps) corporation where just about everyone wears ties or biz-casual (gross).<p>I sat in on one department's hiring rounds with about six candidates. What the dept was <i>looking for</i> was a programmer who had MS/.NET experience to develop on the MediaRoom platform (I managed the internal development team, hence my sitting in; responsibility for operating MediaRoom was under the other dept, however, so this candidate was not going to be able to be part of my team (stupid corporate organizational bullshit where dept mgrs squabble and scramble for stupid feelings of control and shit)). The questions the dept came up with and spent 1-2 hrs torturing the candidates with included <i>zero</i> questions about programming experience and aptitude-gauging type of inquiries. No questions about past projects, current interests, or anything remotely helpful. All the questions that were technical revolved around sysadmin tasks or how many damn acronyms the candidate was familiar with from MS's alphabet soup of platforms & products--literally asking if the candidate knew what they meant, not if they understood purpose or anything else like that. For a fucking programming job. The position stayed open for a <i>year-and-a-half</i> without being filled.<p>Biggest problem I saw? The interview was designed by a guy with zero programming experience trying to hire a programmer. Why the questions he chose? Best I can tell, servers and sysadmin tasks were something his dept had long done, and something he semi-understood (but didn't do himself).<p>In contrast, when I ran hiring for my dept, I requested explicit permission to direct the interviews myself, instead of having them led by HR (though an HR rep was still there). Before setting up an interview, my team and I would meet the candidate for lunch just to get to know them a bit. It was sort of our version of testing- or phone-based screening processes. We could figure out more in an hour lunch that we could <i>trust</i> than automated tests or other devices.<p>After the first candidate's official interview, I heard HR was talking about it. By the second candidate's interview two days later, the SVP of HR sat in on the process with the other HR person who was always there. What was most interesting to HR, apparently, was that candidates didn't display any of the typical nervous behaviors that are so common. About 10 minutes in, we had them relaxed, talking and smiling and laughing like normal, discussing things they did in their free time to take a break from programming, talking about the projects they'd loved and hated the most--even talking about times they'd fucked up. That last bit was really fun to watch HR react to, as they hadn't ever experienced anyone talking about times they'd done something <i>wrong</i> in an interview.<p>There were no bullshit how-would-you-resolve-a-stupid-conflict-with-a-coworker questions. We asked some general tech and programming questions, shot the shit about open source projects that impressed the candidate. The focus, though, was on collaborative tasks where the entire dev team went through a couple exercises with the candidate as if s/he was part of the team already, letting the candidate lead, but basically serving as a normal team would--asking questions, raising objections, saying what a good idea or novel approach something was. It was a great way to get a feel for what it'd be like to work through a problem together.<p>By the time we'd interviewed 4 people, we'd already hired 2 of them and I had to push pretty hard to get a very competitive offer out immediately before finishing all the rounds. I nagged the hell out of them till they were willing to break their own rules of waiting till all interviews were done. Our positions did not stay open even one month before we hired three new people. But making them successful required a lot of effort on my part to plead and nag and bargain to get processes bent so we could pull it off.<p>Hiring feels broken in many businesses. But it doesn't have to be.<p><i>Disclaimer:</i> This was a mid-size company. I'm not saying that companies who receive hundreds or thousands of applicants can afford to take the time to do things this way. I can say that every interview that has ever meant a damn to me were the ones where the people interviewing actually took the time to be relaxed, get to know me a bit, and just make interviewing more like having a conversation. It's not coincidence that each one of those happened to be over coffee or lunch or somewhere away from a conference room and table as the first meeting.",1358406485

Some parts of EADS still used the B787 programme as a model of suppliers and contract management last year. After Boeing was obliged to buy out a couple of there joint-ventures and suppliers.<p>Completely agree on the fact that the Dreamliner wanted to much things at the same time.<p>I only beg to differ on the ""not enough QA"" part. I don't exactly know how Boeings QA looks like, but assume that aerospace QA is more or less similar in the western world since everyone is dealing with the FAA and JAA in one way or the other. And from my experience it's not ""not enough"" QA but the wrong QA.<p>In some parts of supplier related QA the point was reached where people cared more about paper work and certificates (to the point where the use of "";"" instead of "","" in a text field blocked whole deliveries for days) than the actual part. And further assume that the paperwork of what ever part in flying piece of tech that failed was ok. Downside is, the more time QA spends on paer work the less time QA spends on assuring the parts are good.<p>Not that this is a probale cause for the battery issue on hand, so.",1358406431

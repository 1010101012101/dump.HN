Build what seems like it will work, and launch.<p>The true flaw of hacker attitude is underestimation of the job by focusing on the part that looks straightforward, namely the part in code.<p>A bitcoin bank is the application. The bit that's written in code is just a part of it. The actual spec is: under all circumstances, this will either work as a bitcoin bank, or fail safe, or in the worst possible case fail with data loss. That spec requires you to examine the behaviors of the system as a system - you may be sure your opponents see it as such.",1346821084

I was also able to market my freelancing book to 2,000+ freelancers on my Planscope list. Like Nathan with his weekly list, I had a huge head start.<p>* Additionally, the theory that you can't sell to the HN audience is bunk. When I wrote a post similar to Nathan's about how I netted $2k in presales, I made another $1k that day alone off HN traffic. And I'm absolutely certain that Nathan is making sales right now from HN. Something to keep in mind: HN doesn't like being sent to marketing sites. HN wants immediate and direct value. So instead of just showing off your latest product, put together a post about what technical or promotional hurdles you went through putting together your product - i.e., sell through education. <i></i>Look at my submissions to see this in action for both my products.<i></i><p>* Increase customer LTV wherever possible. You could pay Nathan $29 for the book, which triggers as an OK price to pay for most of us. Now that you're interested, for $30 more you can get some videos and PSDs. These people came for one thing and left with another, the same underlying theory supermarkets use to upsell you at the checkout line.<p>* Nathan now has a mailing list of people who have <i>already taken out their credit cards for him</i> in the past. This is pure gold.",1346820770

Patient R is a man who had extensive brain damage to three areas of his brain considered critical for awareness, but who was still demonstrably self-aware. Patient R challenges the assumption that certain brain regions are necessary for awareness or even consciousness, and some see this as supporting the theory that awareness, consciousness, and other higher level mental processes are distributed throughout the brain instead of localized in specific regions.<p>If consciousness is a distributed phenomenon, how developed does the brain need to be before consciousness arises? Why does consciousness persist in the wake of traumatic brain injury, especially in exceptional cases of hydrocephalus?<p>We'd like to make it easy and say, ""this region controls this, this region controls that, and tada, consciousness,"" but nature is just not that easy.

The sharding, for our needs, was far from automatic. In fact, the only way to get MongoDB to shard records evenly across servers (this is with 1.8) was to for all intents and purposes implement our own sharding on top of it. In other words, the global write lock coupled with worthless auto-sharding (at least given our purposes: high write, temporary but mission-critical data) made MongoDB a PITA. That, along with the fact that we were more or less told that MongoDB would be able to handle what we were planning <i>by the MongoDB consultants Aol hired</i> completely soured my view of 10gen. The only reason we needed sharding in the first place was because we were getting large amounts of queued writes on a 32GB server with 16 cores (with < 300 w/s). Pathetic.<p>My point is that if you want to spread out your writes on a database that supports rich queries and honors the ""C"" in CAP, you're going to have to do some work. The distributed DBs are nice and shiny if you can forego some of the nicer querying features of relational DBs (or MongoDB), but not everyone's requirements fit into document-based records, and to assume they do is just NoSQL fanboism.<p>Note: I <i>am</i> using MongoDB for my latest venture because we are realistic about it's abilities and also because our development time with MongoDB is no joke about 1.5x-2x faster than with MySQL (or equivalent).

This is because it is possible to arrive at a solution where no incremental change can improve the fitness.</i><p>False. There is no theoretical or comprehensive empirical study I've ever seen to suggest this is the case. At best, in some scenarios (e.g., multiplex, ordered subset selection) crossover will help speed up the search because it is effectively assuming it's separable, meaning different parts of the problem can be optimized independently. So if you're trying to get all 1s in a bit string, you could imagine separating that into two parts: maximizing the first and second halves of the bit string, then combining the best individuals you would get an optimal answer to the original problem. This is why, for instance, that crossover rarely helps in evolving neural networks; their weights' non-separable nature makes it difficult to select a meaningful subset of the network.<p><i>> Crossover is somewhat helpful against local optima because it allows the algorithm to try combinations of innovations from different solutions. Depending on the fitness landscape, this can be either helpful or useless. Regardless, a GA will, on any non-trivial problem, almost certainly get stuck on a local optimum, which is a very important point for users of GAs to realize.</i><p>Also false. I'll especially take note that this is not the case if you're using a less-than-naive EA. One great example is CMA-ES, which is particularly well suited for handling non-convex, deceptive optimization problems (and uses no crossover).<p><i>> But what is not the case is that mutation prevents crossover from hitting a local optimum. Crossover by itself basically just won't optimize at all</i><p>Again, not true. Consider multiplex. You start with a bunch of random bit strings. IF you have 1s in all indexes somewhere in the population, it's possible (though unlikely) that the algorithm will find the optimal answer. The issue that arises is when you select against the last 1 bit in a certain index in the population; it's now lost forever and thus the GA will at best reach a local optima (optima in the sense of it's the best it can now do with future populations).",1346818536

I know at many universities Campbell is the primary text used for first year biology students so going through 60-80% is not unheard of. At that consumption rate I would be better off buying the book used from Amazon, using it, and then reselling it at a loss of $20-$30.

Look at the lists of billionaires, hectomillionaires, and decamillionaires: a large proportion of them derive their wealth from real estate, certainly enough to make it a top 5 means of capturing wealth in our current system. [1] Perhaps over the <i>next</i> few hundred years what you assert may happen, but much of the world population is still subject to an economic system that richly rewards the original literal rent-seeking behavior on land.<p>I find it ironic that even in intelligent circles like HN, no one really discusses ways to factor out land and shelter expenses. If your payroll is your #1 expense, and the #1 expense of your employees is shelter, then why has so little attention been paid to this lowest of low hanging fruit of expenses? Individuals are generally speaking not rational actors, and I think we might all be surprised at what happens if a post-scarcity reality became feasible.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/erincarlyle/2012/03/13/how-americas-wealthiest-get-rich/2/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.forbes.com/sites/erincarlyle/2012/03/13/how-ameri...</a>",1346818062

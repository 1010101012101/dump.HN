But then again, I only know them because my employer is the one who fired them.<p>I think there's something like 5% unemployment amongst computer programmers in the US. Based on experience with (ex-)coworkers, that number can easily be attributed to people who are looking for programming jobs who aren't competent enough to hold a job. In fact, that unemployment number should probably be higher, and I shudder to think what kind of crappy unmaintainable code is being written by those programmers who really should probably be unemployed (or at least in another field.)<p>In short, our need for programmers doesn't come from some lack of people willing to work for a certain salary; it comes from a lack of people capable of doing the job.",1359446346

For most statically typed languages (C, C++, C#, Java, Objective-C and so on) I tend to use an IDE with a Vim emulator.<p>But honestly, visual debugging is nice and all but I don't know if the debugger is really the biggest loss of not using an IDE - for me it's more the code completion, navigation and refactoring support I'm after. You <i>can</i> get most of that going pretty well with Vim but it's a bit of a hassle.",1359446341

I'd agree that if it's the only medium, there may be issues, but your suggestions are merely alternatives, no better and in some instances slightly worse (no, the postal service is not a valid alternative). Yes, there are other options, but Facebook works well enough for a majority of folk. I'll come clean and say that I'm not a fan of Facebook, I find it too intrusive.

Though I made that a little more difficult by rotating the session keys after every transaction, so if you take over it would force the other person to be ""instantly"" logged out and they'd notice and could do something about it (log back in and log out immediately would suffice).

If your personal use of Facebook had similar results to the author's, you nod your head, perhaps virtually applaud, and share the link. I know I'm tempted to do so here.<p>But I also know that there are people who use Facebook in a way that strengthens, augments and reinforces real-life relationships. I've also read of studies that show a positive, not a negative, correlation between time spent on social media and how engaged people are with others in person. Some will say, ""well, duh"" to that, and will shake their heads at an article like this, which to them only shows that someone doesn't know how to use Facebook.<p>Both experiences are valid. I follow a sociologist on Twitter who writes a lot of essays from the latter viewpoint. To him, it's a theoretical split. There is the ""digital dualist"" theory, that basically says online/offline is a zero sum game and social media makes friendships shallow and disposable, and there is the ""augmented reality"" theory that all is connected, that what we do online <i>is</i> real life and not something different. And he holds the latter theory to be correct while the former, he finds simplistic, sentimental and broken. (I'm thinking of @nathanjurgenson if anyone wants to follow along, have done my best to represent his views but obviously this summary is my own)<p>I disagree with all of the above. It has become ever more clear to me that some people really do use and experience Facebook in a dualistic way while others do not. There is no one, unified, grand theory of Facebook that encompasses all experiences. Both camps would like to say, ""This is how it is, period"", but they are really saying, ""This is how it is <i>for me</i>"".",1359443220

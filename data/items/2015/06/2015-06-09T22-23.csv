If after that you have to qualify - no, I didn&#x27;t mean the common meaning of that word but I meant some arcane and archaic meaning that is not immediately obvious but means something different that I could define if I was called on it - I think you own the misinterpretation. If you used the non-obvious meaning, you should explicitly state that, since you know there <i>is</i> an obvious meaning which would completely overwhelm any other meaning.",1433890779

By any rational standard, as someone a little older than the Millenials described in this article, I should be well off -- degree from a good university, work in tech industry, run my own small business these days, etc. -- and yet I have essentially no chance of buying a viable long-term family home in the city where I live.<p>It doesn&#x27;t make a lot of difference how carefully I save or how hard I work to grow the company revenues, because we simply don&#x27;t have enough houses to go around. That means the property bubble just keeps on growing, and those of my parents&#x27; generation who bought their first home multiple decades ago are now buying up the new ones as well, to use as investments and let out as rentals. They can make more money doing that than all but the most successful and fast-growing business can generate or the very highest paid jobs will pay, and it&#x27;s effectively passive income most of the time, so the cycle continues with the gap widening by the day.<p>The next generation are even worse off, with pressure to have a degree to get just about any kind of job these days leaving them with tens of thousands in student debts before they even start their first job and in most cases doomed to spend much of their 20s just trying to keep up.",1433890516

They helped tremendously with anxiety in a way nothing else (exercise, meditation, relaxation exercises, etc.) did.

The key is <i>very gradually</i> reducing the dose to zero over weeks or even months.

The benefit of docker is three-fold: 1) each process thinks it has an OS to itself, which is a killer feature for native binaries that have weird dependencies 2) network (port) indirection, and 3) filesystem indirection (mounting an arbitrary host dir into an arbitrary container dir).<p>Against all of this is the whole question of how to really use it to develop and deploy custom software!

Minimum wage really stands for minimum living wage which is different from place to place and somewhat artificial (e.g rent). If minimum wage workers could be paid less, the &quot;owners of capital&quot; would (because they don&#x27;t generate that much value)<p>Example: if you order a 9$ burger and it costs 5$ to &quot;manufacture&quot; a burger (food processing, shipping, preparation etc.) and 4$ to have a minimum wage workers assemble it; by eliminating the minimum wage worker, eventually the price of the burger will go down.<p>But who will buy burgers?  Automation/technology is about turning goods into commodities. Eliminating scarcity.<p>So, yeah, I would work for the guy killing minimum wage jobs because without him, 10-15 years from now, you&#x27;d be paying 25$ a burger and most of it will go to the minimum wage worker making 15$/hr doing a job a machine could do.<p>I won&#x27;t bother to argue how mind numbing those jobs are.",1433888691

Because we&#x27;re in 2015 and the way this should work is that someone should be able to scan my medical card (which has an electronic chip in it BTW) and get access to whatever information I&#x27;ve chosen to share.

After payment it would call provider cell phone so user does not have their phone #.  After end of conversation, system automatically tallies bill and gives pittance to me and most money to provider.  At that time also, user is prompted to buy emailed mp3 recording of conversation for x money and provider gets most of that money too.<p>I am very novice and do not have heavy coding experience.

They were not “true believers.” Nevertheless, they worked with others – even the untherapied – easily and efficiently.

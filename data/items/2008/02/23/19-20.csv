For instance, in Psychology, the majority of graduate degrees go into counseling.  Of the more research oriented people left, there is a vast array of fields available; Neuropsych, Cognitive Psych, Industrial Organizational, and so on.  These are fields with public and private sector demand... If you're good, and you publish it is quite possible to land in a tenure track position is 2-3 years.   The biological sciences, which my ex went into, are likewise diverse with high (unless you study ichthyology) demand.  Finally, know that all academia, like startups, is a dice game.  Brilliant is less than half the battle. Being right often counts for nothing.  Hardworking, with force of will and personality, and in the right place at the right time (which is not always luck) play an awfully big part of every success.  Even when you get in, you can easily end up the flunky of someone with similar credentials, but more success.  But hey, that's life, right?",1203796574

122151,comment,121886,121886,0,0,crystalarchives,,,"Interestingly, I've never really been to Digg or Reddit, so all this ""fluff"" is foreign to me. The content here has always been good, I hope it stays that way.<p>I guess most people (myself included) found news.ycombinator.com through the Paul Graham essays and the YCombinator program. As a result, I'm not too worried about fluff; I think those who read PG essays won't be inclined to post garbage, and karma helps as well to encourage good content. Keep up the awesome work here guys!",1203796021

122149,comment,122121,122121,0,0,crystalarchives,,,"I try to maximize productivity and efficiency; if I have a lot of time, I do something I'm less familiar with since I'll probably have to look things up and experiment, without losing state. If I just have a little bit of time, I work on the parts I know I could do in my sleep, so if I get interrupted it's no big deal, I can easily pick up where I left off.<p>But most importantly, I try never to procrastinate, although I don't always succeed... Good luck!",1203795303
122148,comment,122121,122121,0,0,mooneater,,,"I maintain a spreadsheet list of smaller tasks that need doing, vaguely inspired by Getting Things Done.  Add a priority column and sort.  Then each day, review the list to update priorities, and flag items I intend to complete that day.<p>Separate list for major features I intend to add.  Works the same as the task list, except on a much slower timescale.  That one has ended up being much more valuable.<p>The simple act of collecting this all in one spreadsheet doc has resulted in way more clarity in my thinking and planning.  It allows me to bounce between many major areas of work, without losing track.<p>Best of luck!",1203795278

A public company exists for one and only one reason - to maximize shareholder value.  In other words, to increase the wealth of random people that nobody in the company knows.<p>There is only one reason to take a company public - to make money.  An entrepreneur claiming to go public for any other reason is either naive or lying.",1203794678

122140,comment,121890,122139,0,0,fiaz,,,"Interesting....<p>The reference to that list of covert organizations was to imply the fact that there is a lot of snooping going around into people's activities in real life and that I like the fact that I can hang out with some people online without the need to worry about what other people think my intentions are.  Or more directly: I don't like to have to worry about my participation on News.YC being accepted/rejected on criteria other than being voted up or down.<p>You disagree with me on something?  Fine, down vote me or respond, but don't start trying to make predictions on what I might do next.  There is nothing friendly about trying to anticipate what my next move might be so that you can identify something ""alarming"" about what I'm doing.  I think the aptly termed ""fluff"" is harmless, and I've been arguing all along that it contributes to diversity, which is key for idea generation/exchange.  Homogenize the community, and it begins to lose value.<p>I MIGHT submit a series of articles that others think are ""fluff"", but does this mean that now I go on some sort of ""fluff watch list"" and need to be monitored, or perhaps ""dealt with"" because my articles/views/ideas are not in line with the majority members?<p>Apologies to everybody if I am still coming across as implying some sort of conspiratorial tone (in which case you may down mod me or explain to me where I err in my argument), but I still stand by my conviction that monitoring others to ""weed out"" certain ""alarming trends"" is far worse than the pain suffered by ""fluff"".<p>I will add that fluff != spam.  What others judge to be ""fluff"" is just that - a judgement call.  I'm simply speaking out against judgmental attitudes en masse (or if you prefer the shortened terminology - mobs).<p>I appreciate the response!!",1203793212

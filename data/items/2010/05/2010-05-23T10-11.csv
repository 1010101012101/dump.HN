1372111,comment,1371244,1372017,0,0,barrkel,,,"Seems to me that fanatics usually serve their organization's rational purposes. Anger and rage are also rational, even when they result in self-harm; their perceived ""irrationality"" is the reason why it's not good to provoke someone. Such emotions are like a kind of mutually assured destruction, on a small scale.<p>Terrorist organizations etc. use such actors rationally, in order to generate fear, reaction, power by radicalizing their host societies, etc. They are rational actors, and are susceptible to MAD logic.<p>When we are at risk of colossal attack by insane <i>individuals</i>, we'll be in a much worse place.",1274611812

It will give you all of your software (dev tools, test stack, etc) for free which will help reduce an initial overhead.<p>That takes time, so do it immediately after 15. and 25.<p>BTW: I'm already making £3k per month from this and so far I've only sold a few WebParts to existing contacts. I would totally recommend little side projects like this if you do have specialised domain knowledge that you can take advantage of in a way that doesn't conflict with your current employer (if you have one).<p>The motivation to start the micro ISV was simply to fund my MSc and to cover the costs of the hardware that my project/paper requires. But it's quickly becoming a viable business on it's own so I might keep it up long-term.",1274611367

If the other party (the cop) is informed and continues the interaction, you are covered.  As I have written before, the 2-party consent rules are specifically for the benefit of low-lifes.  Nothing prevents one party reporting what transpired in a conversation, all the anti-recording laws do is to allow liars to get away with it by not preserving an objective record.",1274611260
1372108,comment,1372037,1372037,0,0,subbu,,,"Some nice changes there. Namespaces make it even more easy to work with legacy databases or mixing rails tables with say wordpress which prefixes all its tables with 'wp_'. Another nifty change w.r.t MySQL: positioning using :first => true and :after => :other_column. That allows us to keep the attributes in a nice order. Otherwise all the new columns used go below created_at and updated_at which was kind of ugly.",1274610952
1372106,comment,1371896,1371896,0,0,barrkel,,,"Obfuscation to protect source code, implementation details, etc. I believe is very rarely warranted. Most applications have fairly mundane implementations, with much of the differentiator being fit and finish of the whole. Even having the source code directly, rather than having to disassemble it, wouldn't be a huge risk IMO - any entity profiting from it will clearly be culpable of copyright violation.<p>It's easy to get paranoid about the value of source code. The fact is, most mature codebases are sufficiently scruffy that even their developers wouldn't want to start from that codebase if they were to create a competitor. And when you're not familiar with a body of source, it takes a lot of work to understand its architecture and how it's put together; so then the risk is even lower.<p>Obfuscation as a speedbump to cracking has more to say for it. If the obfuscation badly affects stability, I'd suggest only using it for a handful of core modules, code that lies on the critical path for most useful application uses. Obviously, it's important that the code isn't something trivial, like a boolean license check. It would have to be a module that would be non-trivial to reimplement and re-link into the application.<p>But of course I'd suggest other things, like baking in some kind of internet dependencies.",1274610817

1372104,comment,1371834,1371834,0,0,lotharbot,,,"Ultimately, a visualization is an attempt to communicate some pattern(s) in the data.  Visualizations can suffer from the same issues as other forms of communication:<p>- <i>inadequate information</i>.  Readers can't draw conclusions from information you don't include.  Commonly missing information: labels, scale, definitions, context for the data.<p>- <i>information overload</i>.  Readers can't figure out which specific conclusions you're trying to communicate if there are many possible conclusions.  Highlight the things about the data that you want to bring out using words, colors, arrows, or visualizations of subsets of the data.<p>- <i>muddled presentation</i>.  A blurry graphic is as difficult to understand as writing filled with misspellings and poor grammar.  A busy graphic is as difficult to understand as a long, babbling diatribe filled with unnecessarily complex vocabulary.  An ambiguously labeled graphic is as difficult to understand as writing filled with ambiguous pronouns.<p>- <i>inability to dig deeper</i>.  Readers can't figure out if your conclusions are sound if they can't look at the details.  Interactive visualizations (based on the complete data set) allow users to see how each bit of data fits into the overall picture, and to test your conclusions on subsets of the data.  If all you present is a static graphic based on a restricted data set, it's harder to check if you've cherry-picked data.<p>- <i>unfamiliarity with the language or conventions</i>.  Someone unfamiliar with programming will have a hard time understanding certain HN posts, even if they're well written.  Someone unfamiliar with bar graphs will have a hard time understanding a visualization based around them, even if it's a good visualization.<p>- <i>boring subject matter</i>.  You can make the greatest visualization in the world, but if the audience doesn't care enough to look at it long enough to understand, your point won't get communicated.",1274610584

1372095,comment,1371802,1372007,0,0,edd,,,"I used to be on Reddit in the Lisp days (before it had many users). The day that they introduced the `my.reddit` was when the quality of posts massively fell. The recommended behaviour at that point was to try and train your recommendation engine by voting for things you liked and down vote things you didn't. The `my.reddit` then showed your own personal homepage. From that point votes no longer became a quality control as people would vote without thinking based on a headline.<p>I am all for some way of adding meta-data to links so a user can filter based on them. But you have to be really careful to not turn votes in to a meaningless action and keep them as a way of voting on quality rather than opinion.<p>(ps. I stopped using Reddit shortly after that change and as such haven't seen/used it recently and don't know how the sub-reddits are doing to manage that situation. Also it was one of many changes that negatively effected signal-noise but one I always feel was the turning point)",1274609188

No special software required. It just works.<p>What Google are doing now is taking that further and making that include data like music, pictures, TXT messages, etc. So now when you replace your android that stuff automatically comes across.<p>What would be lovely is that instead of just sync, whether we could manage the older devices. i.e: Get a new mobile, sync it, declare the old mobile to be wiped and have the old mobile hear that and purge itself.<p>This helps on the security side, as you could remotely wipe a stolen device. But it also helps with re-selling used phones safe in the knowledge that your data is intact and you're not leaving any on the device.<p>I think it's the next obvious gap filler in the cloud-owning-the-data space. We can move and sync, now clean up behind us.<p>Well, that and the fact that if data is persisted across all devices that you eventually will exceed the storage capacity of the device itself. But I'm guessing that network speed will keep pace with this and by the time we're at that crunch point Google will be able to serve that stuff on-demand and just use the phone as a local cache rather than as the persistent storage itself.",1274608850

While Jobs' contributions are not quite on the same level as what Edison, Einstein, Hopper, Ritchie or Turing did, Bill Gates did nothing at of that magnitude.<p>Had Microsoft never existed, 8-bit home computers would have used another version of BASIC. There were a couple floating around (you can play with them with an Atari or BBC emulator). Had Microsoft never existed, IBM would have adopted CP/M as its OS and PC clones would have been built around it (and would be more diverse because CP/M was much more portable than MS-DOS), but I doubt they'd be as common as they are today. We would probably have a much more diverse hardware environment (think Amiga, Archimedes, Transputer), which could have created a cross-platform standard for software, most likely based on POSIX and X. Apple would still have launched the Lisa, and the Mac and they'd be successful. The web would be born anyway and so would be free and open source software (but there would probably be much less incentive to use it).<p>It's a horrible thing to say, but had Bill Gates decided to be a banker or a lawyer, the world would be a much better place.

Here's some feedback...though it's vague, you didn't specify any specific part of your site for me to address:<p>- The color of red in your logo at the top doesn't match the red in your footer. (Minor, maybe, but this was screaming at me.)<p>- The overall design could be balanced a bit better. The area at the top which summarizes your business is quite spacious, whereas the content underneath (Stroll, Explore, Create, and Story sections, etc) feel cramped. Consider a CSS grid layout to give your elements and position some ""visual rhythm"" (or a consistent visual feel that allows the eye to casually consume content without jarring distractions and interruptions within the layout). <a href=""http://960.gs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://960.gs</a> or <a href=""http://blueprintcss.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blueprintcss.org</a> is quite nice for this.<p>- RedCappi seems to be two products in one (with a tab on the right allowing the user to switch information between the two products. This is not very intuitive and I'd be willing to bet that the majority of your web builder traffic is a lot less than your email marketing traffic. Consider separating the two products more clearly and giving each their own space on your domain. This will improve SEM/SEO as well as help users to more quickly find the information they need.<p>- WAY too many pricing plans. By offering so many options, you are probably scaring your customers away from making a decision they (may or may not) have to live with. Everything starts out free for your customers anyway, so why not just let them grow their plan as their needs require it. You can mention limitations, but I wouldn't throw prices in their face unless they're looking. And when the only thing between plans that change is the number of contacts allowed, make the plan configurable with a slider. MUCH easier to understand for the user and they can play around with the slider to fit their plan (giving them the perception of more control, which they'll love). Heroku does this if you want an example. (<a href=""http://www.heroku.com/pricing"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.heroku.com/pricing</a>)<p>- I like the idea...

I'm seeing far more comments here that support the free for all you describe than those simply frightened by the abuse this bill will likely be used for.<p>I have to say I'm anti-SOPA or people will start going off on me for lack of actually understanding my point.<p>But anyway, as far as those who say piracy is free advertising, that's total dog shit. The theory goes that those who pirate wouldn't buy the product anyway but I can easily disprove that. Here's how:<p>There are tiny minority who actually would never buy the product. They'd be negligible if piracy weren't so common these days.<p>Then we've got a group who can't afford it. These people will do one of two things: they'll either find a cheaper alternative or save up. Either way it doesn't hurt legit businesses.<p>That scenario plays out in a world where we've come up with a way to stop the majority of piracy. Currently what happens is that the people who wouldve gotten an alternative or saved up just pirate the damn thing. In this case they're not only hurting business but if they're one of the these Free Software crusaders then they're actually hurting their own movement! Our imaginary person could have chosen to use FOSS or Open Source but they go the pirated proprietary route instead.<p>There's also an undercurrent or a subtext here (whatever you want to call it) with a free software advocate slant. There are some free software evangelists that believe that by cutting into the profits of corporations, piracy is good. These people are only hurting their own movement for the reasons I've stated above. I see so many who'd force ""Free Software"" on us all because it is the One True Way. Well I'd say if you love freedom so damn much then let me be free to lock myself into whatever proprietary technology I want. Let me be free to vote with my wallet and to vote with what software I use.<p>I use Linux. I love it. I also love my Mac too.

It could be argued that this is unfair to those that have worked their full time to earn their full options grant. Usually, in this arrangement, a certain percentage of your shares are subject to the trigger (so, 25% vest immediately, for example). I think it would be unusual for 100% of your options to vest immediately upon acquisition: what if you were acquired a month after you joined?<p>The second type is double-trigger. Let's say that you have 75% of your options unvested in an acquisition, and you have 3 years remaining to vest at the new company. If they fire you, you lose the rest of your options. Double-trigger acceleration is where your options vest immediately if you are not fired ""for cause"". That means that, as long as you are not being grossly negligent at your job, the new company can't screw you out of your unvested options by laying you off.<p>The one thing to remember here, is that a lot of this is subject to your leverage over the company and the leverage the company has with its new acquirer. All of these terms are subject to renegotiation in an acquisition, and anything could change at any time -- look at what happened with Zynga.<p>Consider it a gentleman's agreement, for the most part. Good people will honor it, shitty people might try to screw you. As with anything, you should only do business with those you trust.<p>And finally, the absolute best way to make sure you get the full value of your options (as an employee or a founder) is to always make sure you are indispensable to the company. A company who needs you can't screw you.<p>(final note: IANAL, this is my understanding of how things work)",1321647931

Why?  Because it's an integrated set of web tools that's better than the competition, because:<p>1. There's still no alternative to Closure Compiler.  It type-checks your JavaScript, checks your dependencies, globally renames properties and variables, strips whitespace, replaces expensive constructs with shorter ones, and does this all basically transparently.<p>2. There's no alternative to Closure Templates if you want to fill templates on both the client and server sides (alas, if only the server side weren't Java-only).  This opens up a lot of possibilities for rich AJAX apps, having an efficient JS templating language.<p>3. It can globally optimize your CSS classes across JS/HTML/CSS, something that no individual library could ever accomplish.  Sass will minify your CSS, removing whitespace.  Closure Stylesheets will minify your CSS, and then <i>rename all your CSS classes to the shortest possible identifier</i>.<p>4. All of this is easily debuggable, with development mode flags to give you the original names, so that you can use meaningful names in your source code and get fast output code that doesn't make your users wait.<p>5. Closure Templates are trivially internationalizable, and it's not hard to extract all text in them for translation.<p>6. Closure Stylesheets can Bidi-flip the entire page for RTL languages, so that when you want to launch in Arabic, you don't need to worry about changing all your Sass rules to include a $left variable that's 'left' in LTR languages and 'right' in RTL ones.<p>7. Closure Library has a wide array of UI widgets, including some pretty esoteric ones.<p>I'd argue about Closure doing less than Sass.  It does less <i>syntactically</i>.  But that's not the point; syntax is rarely the bottleneck when programming.  Closure lets you completely avoid thinking about several things that are <i>a pain in the ass</i> to get right if you have to do them manually.  Like making your JS tight and optimized so your site doesn't take forever to load.  Or internationalizing - heaven forbid your users want to use a language other than English to read your site.  Or creating separate debug & release versions of your code so you can understand what's going on and still release something lean & mean.  Having worked in another corner of Google where many of these things are still handled manually, I guarantee you that you'll lose more productivity on them than on not having nested selectors.",1321647861

Wikipedia risks alienating large numbers of their authors and editors if they introduce ads.<p>The Wikipedia authors and editors I have heard speak about this topic seem to be strongly opposed to any kind of commercialization and ads. Writing for Wikipedia is not always fun and sometimes tedious and annoying work. I dont think Wikipedia can afford to ignore their authors and editors or risk losing them.

I, however, dont see anyone who would be willing to start such a movement and I also dont see how such a movement could win over large numbers.<p>Wikipedias relatively federal structure would certainly allow for interesting experiments.

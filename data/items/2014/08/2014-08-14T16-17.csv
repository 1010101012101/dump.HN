In fact I need to read it again.<p>I like you have had perhaps two periods of feeling incredible inadequate since I moved to London 3 years ago. The quarter-life crisis is well recognised if you do a quick search.<p>One thing is certain: Money != Happiness. Last time I received a pay rise I requested a day off every fortnight. That day I get so much done, it is unbelievable. Just that day makes me happy.

The way that I keep sane is I try to stay positive by going to meetups and being with other people who are excited about the more advanced things and have the same type of hunger for purpose. At home I also work on personal projects and explore new things and I would recommend that. I quit my job like you a year after the startup I was with was acquired because they really didn&#x27;t care about the tech aspect of it and joined a new one but I am not really challenged (even thought they needed to hire a senior software engineer) and try to lose myself in my routine so the day goes by quick. I think what I am going to have to do for purpose is do more open-source projects or build small apps of my own. I would recommend that. Focus on your family too and your non-tech life, remembering how valuable they are in helping you not think of this. There are tons of us like you.",1408035548
8178393,comment,8176464,8176464,3,0,usea,,,"In college I shared an apartment with some friends. Every few weeks, when somebody was watching a movie it would spontaneously rewind part-way into the movie. It happened infrequently enough that we didn&#x27;t really investigate until one night when a bunch of people were over. The movie would rewind whenever the lights in the living room were off, and somebody pulled the cord on the ceiling fan to change its speed. It was 100% reproducible, but baffling.<p>After much investigation, we traced the problem to a Rock Band drum set foot pedal. It has an AC adapter plugged into the wall, and also acts as pressing L on the PS3 controller when it&#x27;s triggered. Somehow, pulling the cord on the ceiling fan made the foot pedal act like it got kicked, which would rewind the movie playing on the PS3. Unplugging the foot pedal or drum set solved the problem.",1408035548

Is the measure to generate or exit with enough income to spend more time with my kids? If so, that&#x27;s pretty rare I think. By &quot;more time&quot;, I assume we mean substantially more, as in, not having work a full time job and maintain current lifestyle.<p>That&#x27;s the 1 in a million odds I&#x27;m talking about. It&#x27;s not like the lottery where you find out instantly if you win or lose.

It&#x27;s more about mixing levels of rigor.<p>Case in point: a tech company releases diversity numbers. A reasonable point is to ask for a breakdown into tech, admin, support, etc. Often in these companies the diversity is shoved into sales and marketing.<p>But then another commenter will ask about the diversity of the candidates, and speculate that they are identical to the company&#x27;s hires, and then &quot;prove&quot; that the company&#x27;s practices are unbiased.<p>So then you point out that a company is not a blushing maid, that they choose the people they recruit, project an image that influences self-selection, and heavily encourage people to refer their friends. And then you get attacked for demanding too much rigor.<p>What the argument is really about is whether there is a problem to fix. The diversity numbers clearly indicate that there is.

Empty forum creation with just links, profile bombing or just mass posting are hard to deal with. We have advanced captcha, clever javascript tricks, manual cleaning, ip banning... However, when you are dealing with human farms or just a smart spammer, it&#x27;s almost impossible to keep up. Plus it&#x27;s only a side thing that I run for free entirely, so I don&#x27;t want to waste time dealing with it. Some people do use the forums for good though.<p>Concerning this particular problem, my experience is in 98% of the case, they are not going to carry on with their threats. Almost every emails asking for link removals (and that&#x27;s a lot!) I&#x27;ve received from site owners is when they have hired a SEO company (or run the bots themselves) that has spammed the forums of my platform.<p>Something piss me off about these people. It&#x27;s when they then ask YOU to remove their mess. Without any compensation. I usually not respond (I am carrying on cleaning tasks whenever I want and if I want.) or respond with $150 bill. They should have keep the login/password or keep access to the forgotten password email. I don&#x27;t know why I will do special treatments.<p>Funny story. I think the only time I&#x27;ve received a link removal requests explaining their were poor victims of negative SEO, it was from the same people that 2 weeks in the past sent me a email explaining their are the ones who have spammed the forums. They think we are stupid or something. I guess they haven&#x27;t liked the idea of paying for spam cleaning. Shady once, shady forever.",1408035363

That is also inefficient in a way that favors certain kinds of players in the marketplace.<p>For instance, if I knew the producer of certain items, I might decide to buy directly from them instead of through a middleman, such as a grocery store, but now there are all kinds of barriers to doing just that. Furthermore, if I could somehow contact the coffee farmer who grew my coffee beans, then I could also ask him for a particular kind of bean that I might prefer. This is less efficient in the production sense than shipping everything in large batches, but might be more efficient in the sense of getting what I want. It is quite common when shopping for furniture to find exactly what you want, except too wide, narrow, high, etc. Having it hand-made in the west would be prohibitively expensive, perhaps 10x of the price of the item, so we settle for the one which is not quite right.

Similarly, an employer who offers lots of employee-friendly flexibility – you can always leave early, no penalties for refusing an offered shift, etc – could pay less.<p>People then get compensated for what they care most about, not what a legislature has decreed as the only acceptable wage rate. They&#x27;d also tend to sort into the workplaces that best fit their circumstances. Social surplus is maximized.<p>A wage floor prevents these sorts of adjustments, because it creates a surplus of hours-offered at the higher wage, while eliminating other hours-demanded. (For example, it&#x27;s no longer economical to have 3 registers open, or to check on the restrooms hourly, or to bring customers their own orders as opposed to having them picked up, or to have someone wandering the store floor for issues/questions.) Thus the hours available can be rationed out as an inducement for other, harder-to-regulate concessions.<p>So while the wage floor makes employers (who continue to employ) pay more, in that one dimension, it strengthens their powers of control/coercion is most others.<p>The absolute best system for employees is tight labor markets, where if anything about the job is bad – wage, hours, respect – they can walk across the street for another job-on-offer at about the same wage with a better mix of everything. That best system is sabotaged by lots of well-intended restrictions on employment relationships, so we only see it occasionally, during transient booms and in boom regions (like, recently, North Dakota).",1408034337

Each of the stories is of someone who certainly wouldn&#x27;t have succeeded to the degree they did without personal qualities that transcended their origins, rather than family wealth, the original argument. Richard Branson didn&#x27;t build his present empire by buying it with his family&#x27;s money -- he created it out of his wits. Elon Musk is another story of the same kind -- it&#x27;s hyperbolic to argue that he became successful because of inherited wealth as opposed to personal ingenuity and drive.<p>> Even the lowest of them started within the professional upper-middle class (roughly where you and I probably are), which is already most of the way up the class scale, in percentile terms.<p>But this isn&#x27;t about class -- it might be about genetics, and it certainly isn&#x27;t about family money, the original offered explanation. For these stories, class and family background are correlations, not causes.<p>What we&#x27;re talking about here are stories of exceptional success with no obvious cause apart from personal drive and ingenuity.

(You&#x27;ve slipped into some other scripted debate, with fuzzy political euphemisms like &quot;making ends meet&quot;, which is only tangentially related to the point I&#x27;m making about the topic of this article.)<p>The point above is that the system has many, many parameters in constant dynamic adjustment. Setting a minimum on one that&#x27;s easy-to-observe (hourly wages) in law doesn&#x27;t just cause that one value to change.<p>The adjustments happen all over. Marginal workers aren&#x27;t hired or kept-on-staff. Hours of operation are trimmed. Outfits run on slimmer crews. It&#x27;s harder to find someone to ask a question. Lines for check-out get longer. Facilities go a little longer between restocking/cleaning. (Minimum wages mean grosser store bathrooms.) Unregulated, harder-to measure benefits get trimmed. The topic of this article, schedule predictability or flexibility, is just such a benefit.<p>And it doesn&#x27;t require conscious tit-for-tat book-balancing action by employers for these trade-offs to happen. As they notice they&#x27;re making less, adjustments happen. (Or, smaller businesses that are slow to adjust simply become uneconomical and leave the market: minimum wages benefit Wal-Marts & McDonalds, with their expert formula operations, over intuitive &quot;Mom-and-Pops&quot;.) Over time, since more people are now eager for extra hours at the legally-mandated higher salary, it&#x27;s easier to place more informal demands on those people, like &quot;you better take every shift when offered, or it won&#x27;t be offered again&quot;.<p>There are likely some good workers who&#x27;d prefer steadier work, in predicable shifts, at a lower wage. That agreement is made illegal by minimum wage laws, and they are forced to compete with a larger group of people looking to scoop up shorter, more random, higher-paying shifts.",1408033280

You believe that you are good at what you do and are meant for great things but you have to do your job even though it doesn&#x27;t do justice to your capabilities. How do you cope with that? Seeing your future as an underachiever pains you. What do you do?<p>It sounds like your someone with ambition. You know you&#x27;re capable of great things and wouldn&#x27;t be satisfied with anything less. I&#x27;m like that too and I thought a lot about it.<p>IMO, the ultimate goal is to be happy, so the natural question is how these ambitions translate to happiness and whether you could do better by taking another approach to happiness.<p>Other approaches might work for other people, but I suspect that they wouldn&#x27;t work for people with true ambitions. I suspect that people with true ambitions are so driven and motivated to do big things that they won&#x27;t really be able to rid themselves of these thoughts. If you try to settle down into some nice relaxing lifestyle where you should be happy, you&#x27;ll always be haunted by the thoughts that you could/should be doing something better.<p>Note: I&#x27;m saying &quot;suspect&quot; a lot because I&#x27;m only 21 and am not <i>too</i> confident in this hypothesis.<p>So if you&#x27;re ambitions are a core part of you, I suspect that it&#x27;s best to pursue them. And if you need to get yourself some stability in the short term, don&#x27;t worry about it. Do what you can with what you have, and think long-term.<p>- - -<p>Also, I hate the idea that smart and ambitious people can&#x27;t pursue their ambitions because they need to pay the bills.

I would be extremely surprised if Google got this wrong.<p>This mass funelling of inlinks, also called a Sybil attack are not that hard to defend against if one tweaks the Pagerank equations just a little bit. The source of the problem in the original Pagerank equation was that it used <i>addition</i>. The Pagerank of a page was defined to be the sum of all inlink weights flowing in. Now sum is a problem because it cannot distinguish between links from a million shitty pages, from a link from a golden page if the total link weight flowing in is the same. I seriously doubt if sum is used anymore.<p>The solution is fairly straightforward, dont use a sum, use a function that weighs higher values higher. An extreme example would be the MAX operator. In this case, among all the inlinks my site receives, only the one with the maximum inflow counts, all the crappy inlinks might as well have not existed. Max is brittle though and causes instabilities in the convergence, but variations of soft max works decently enough in theory. To phrase it in another way, the original Pagerank equations used the L1 norm of the in-flow vector, one can use Lp norm [0] or fractional powers Lp norms with a higher p .

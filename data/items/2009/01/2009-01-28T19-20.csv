Meditation is not easy to learn from books, and the instruction really benefits from discussions around how it is going for you in particular.<p>Personally, I learned to meditated from a Shambhala center.  They teach shamatha/vipassana meditation, which are the two most common forms of Buddhist meditation.  The (over-simplified) explanation is that Shamatha is about quieting the mind, and Vipassana about awareness/insight.<p>In terms of your basic question, meditation <i>can</i> be as simple as sitting on the couch and watching empty space for a couple of minutes, if you are sitting on the couch and watching empty space the right way.  Generally speaking, there are postures that serve better than couch-sitting, and instructions that are more sophisticated than ""watching empty space"", and a qualified meditation instructor can help you with those.<p>If you really don't have access to a local instructor, get in touch with me privately, and I'll see what I can do for you.",1233172034

I don&#x27;t know what that would look like or how it would affect households already economically strained with limited capacity to move, but I doubt it will be a good situation.<p>The disruption to California&#x27;s ability to produce food will also affect people outside of the state, raising prices.<p>There&#x27;s probably water around to import if the price is right if it came to that, so I think it just becomes a question of market forces and how the drought will impact California&#x27;s economy and the country.

And that doesn’t even consider whether to say someting[sic] <i>is</i> O(n²), <i>has</i> O(n²), or <i>is of</i> O(n²).<p>That has more to do with how the rest of the sentence is constructed, and to some extent the selection of pronunciation of O(n²). e.g., selecting &quot;order n-squared&quot; makes &quot;is of&quot; the natural choice, while &quot;big-oh n-squared&quot; is less grammatically awkward with &quot;is&quot; (arguably, the former example could be &quot;of order n-squared&quot;, in which case &quot;is of&quot; is not actually different from &quot;is&quot;). To completely disambiguate, one should specify what the growth is in respect to: time, space, or something else. For example &quot;In the worst case, quicksort is oh of n-squared with respect to time.&quot; &quot;Has&quot; should be reserved for when using O(n²) as an adjective, e.g. &quot;Quicksort normally has oh of n log n growth in time.&quot;",1412037964

8386167,comment,8385295,8385930,2,0,_delirium,,,"> For an example see, any centrally planned economy, ever.<p>We&#x27;re pretty centrally planned here in Denmark, and it works well. :)<p>The key is to centrally plan infrastructure, but not <i>everything</i>. Electricity, healthcare, heating, oil/gas production, transport, education, and other basic infrastructure is mainly centrally planned, but plenty of the economy isn&#x27;t. Things are also not always centrally <i>operated</i> (transit is usually bid out to private companies to operate), but infrastructure, energy, and other common resources are generally centrally <i>planned</i>. I think overall this produces results that are less chaotic and short-term-profit-maximizing, and more sensible.<p>Central planners can also use market mechanisms where appropriate, so planning and markets aren&#x27;t exclusive. For example, the university system is 100% public and generally rationally planned, but there are also market mechanisms within it that reallocate funds based on various metrics, such as tying # of admissions slots in various fields to employment outcomes. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s perfect, but I strongly suspect a laissez-faire market would produce worse outcomes.<p>(You do, of course, also need a functioning civil society, so that the planning isn&#x27;t abysmally stupid, but that is basically a prerequisite for democracy to work at all.)",1412037473

They are also hard to set up: so many parameters! Given that, I found it really strange that they went straight for a neural network (and then implemented one themselves!). Surely the place to start would be Naive Bayes, followed up with regularized logistic regression (through something like glmnet).

Dharmendra Modha, in charge of IBM’s Synapse “neuromorphic” chips claims that IBM “will deliver computer equivalent of human brain” by 2018. I have heard echo of this claim in statements of virtually all recently funded AI and Deep Learning companies. While some progress in speech processing and image recognition will be made, it will not be sufficient to justify lofty valuations of recent funding events.<p>Symbol based computing technologies, including point-to-point “deep” neural networks can not possibly deliver on claims made by many of these well funded Deep Learning labs and startups. Here are just three of the reasons:<p>1. Every single innovation in evolution of vertebrate brains was due to advances in organism locomotion, and none of the new formations indicate the emergence of symbol processing in cortex.<p>2.Human intelligence is a product of resonating, coupled electric fields produced by massive population of neurons, synapses and ion channels of cortex resulting in dynamic, AM modulated waves in gamma and beta range, not static point-to-point neural networks.<p>3. Human memories are formed in hippocampus via “phase precession” theta waves which transform time events into spatial domain without use of symbols like time stamps.<p>Each of the above three empirical findings invalidates AI’s symbolic, computation approach. “Artificially Intelligent” computers will certainly not appear in next 20-30 years, what market needs today and tomorrow are  “mobile assistants” augmenting human memory and intelligence, which will be delivered by rapid advances in wearable sensors and neuromorphic chips operating under control of real neural science, not AI.<p>Roman Ormandy\nFounder \nEmbody Corp",1412037235

However, let me share my current perspective.<p>I grew up in a world where software was owned by me and effectively free. What I needed but couldn&#x27;t afford I could crack if I cared. Most of the time I didn&#x27;t care, or there were better free tools. But sometimes it mattered. I learned my graphics skills as a kid on cracked Corel Draw and Photoshop (in the end I switched to Paint.NET + GIMP + Inkscape combo, as I don&#x27;t want to publish - even for free - things done on &quot;stolen&quot; software, but all those tools are inferior compared to paid ones). I learned my Office skills as a kid on pirated MS Office.<p>I started programming around 13 years ago. Programming tools were already mostly free at that time (thank you Microsoft for MSVC++2003 Toolkit, though I loved my pirated Visual C++ 6.0). But it&#x27;s not about piracy, it&#x27;s about access. I learned how to code because I wanted to make games, and my primary inspiration and motivation throughout the teenage years was the ability to dig in and tweak various games. I knew my way around StarCraft binaries. Hell, my first serious application of Assembly was patching SC using StarGraft. I read UnrealScript files extracted from Unreal Tournament games. I hex-edited saves, tweaked data files, poked and twisted many games. <i>All of this was possible because I owned the data.</i> That is, the files were there, on my hard drive, unprotected. I built my whole career and half of my life on top of that.<p>To quote pg[0], <i>&quot;It is by poking about inside current technology that hackers get ideas for the next generation. No thanks, intellectual homeowners may say, we don&#x27;t need any outside help. But they&#x27;re wrong. The next generation of computer technology has often—perhaps more often than not—been developed by outsiders.&quot;</i>.<p>What I&#x27;m really afraid of is that the next generation, the generation of my children, will not be able to poke inside anything, because everything will be accessed remotely. In order to learn and grow I didn&#x27;t need a credit card when I was 13, but I fear the next generation will not have that luxury.<p>TL; DR: think of the children.<p>[0] - <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/gba.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/gba.html</a>",1412036385

If I wanted to get on the internet, I had to wander on down to a cafe and use their wireless. This took a while. In particular, it shut down at 12. One could continue to work by plugging in outside and kneeling in the darkness. If you did this, you were certain to have better things to do than procrastinate. I did get an awful lot done.<p>Sadly, it was only temporary. It was cold out there, I caught the flu, and decided I might like internet at home after all.",1211079551

You have a few practical options, mostly already covered:<p>1) White (actually pink) noise generation. Cheapest way is to get a box fan and let it run.<p>2) Active noise cancellation. You can get Bose headphones. Sony Walkmans have built-in noise cancellation that works ok.<p>3) Best bet: Find a better place. Lots of buildings are designed such that noise is minimal. I'm in such a place right now.",1211079113

193120,comment,192924,192924,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"In <i>Peopleware</i> Demarco and Lister cite 1960s-era research from Cornell which found that having music on in the background did not interfere with logic or arithmetical thinking, but reduced people's ability to make creative leaps. Even if you think you're not listening to the music, part of your brain is being distracted by it.<p>There are many who find that white noise works better than music. And there are those who require music to get anything done at all -- maybe these are the exceptions that prove the rule (hey, it's psychology -- there are exceptions to <i>every</i> rule), or maybe they're people who would otherwise be <i>really creative</i> in finding ways to waste time instead of getting work done. ;)<p>But the <i>Peopleware</i> conclusion is that there really is nothing that's as good as actual quiet. That matches my experience, and apparently yours as well. Perhaps you need to do what so many other hackers are driven to do: Find the hours of the day when the building is quiet and work then. Or line your office space in soundproofing foam. Or find a quiet library nearby. Or move as soon as you can...<p>I second the recommendation of Etymotic ER-4P earphones, BTW, if there's no other option but to try them.",1211078693

My laptop is now my news.yc machine. It is hilarious to have PG publish the same solution two days later. :)<p>I tried the noprocrast setting on this site. Reading between the lines of his essay, I surmise that PG, like me, has evolved around noprocrast. My lizard brain has figured out how to click the override button before my conscious mind can notice.<p>Most of the rest of the stuff I read is a few dozen blogs. They update through RSS, and there are few enough of them (and I skim quickly enough) that they aren't a big time sink.

And while it is relatively small in that use now, he really needs to make a compelling argument to why it won't work that way in the future.<p>Further, it's worth pointing out that Krugman endorses a monetary system that makes people poor, via inflating the money supply by printing funds to underwrite policies that benefit, primarily, politicians.<p>A currency whose supply is fixed, or whose inflation rate is constant and predictable (like bitcoin) is better for facilitating transactions.<p>When you have a variable (and often high these days- in the US money supply is up over %50 in recent years) rate of inflation, it wrecks havoc with prices and other signals causing malinvestment and worsening the economy.<p>Something that Krugman, to my knowledge, has never answered for.<p>---<p>Since I am not allowed to reply to the person below me:<p>It's quite silly to to say that a limited supply of a currency is bad for it.  There is little incentive to hang onto bitcoins.  A simple example will prove this to you: The amount of computer you can get for a given amount of money improves dramatically every three years.  You could just hold onto your money and buy a much better computer.  Thus, relative to computers, the dollar is deflationary.... yet people still buy computers.<p>This is the kind of argument Krugman gives because he wants to excuse the inflation that has destroyed the dollar, and the economy.... but it is nonsensical.   People still buy computers.",1365807596

Thus dialtone indicates that: (1) line is reasonably usable, (2) switch has at least theoreticaly resources to connect some call (not necessarily any) and (3) switch actually has resources to decode number you are going to dial.<p>I have seen hybrid PBXes where dial tone is generated by same part of circutiry that decodes DTMF.",1365807540

5541580,comment,5539231,5539231,5,0,samcrawford,,,"I too joined Lehman as a graduate in 2007. My experience was different; I was based in the London office and was in a back-office role (IT Infrastructure). I also worked there as an intern in 2005-2006 (or ""Industrial Placement"" in Lehman-speak).<p>I have to say I enjoyed my time there. I primarily worked as a developer in a non-developer team, but was continually encouraged by management to pursue this work. This led to work with development teams in other regions, which really helped expand my horizons.<p>When I started making money from my website (independent of Lehman and unrelated to finance) and wanted to start it as a business, I had to approach legal and my division's MD for approval. They were completely supportive and again encouraged this work.<p>The downfall of Lehman was a sad but strangely exciting time for me. I remember staying up all night on September 14th watching the number of remote access sessions running, and suspected those users were doing the same as me and watching Bloomberg for an announcement. The following days and weeks saw a lot of interesting events take place, particularly from an infrastructure point of view. Barclays and Nomura (who bought different regions of the bank a few weeks apart) both rushed to connect their infrastructure to Lehman's, which resulted in some curious situations I'm still reluctant to mention publicly!<p>The most interesting part of it was the transition to Nomura for me. I stayed on there until mid-2010. It was a very different environment to Lehman. Our small team was given vastly expanded responsibilities to build out key services and infrastructure lost during the bankruptcy, and our team truly operated like a startup for about 9 months. We toiled tirelessly with teams in other regions to get services online before deadlines, and got a real sense of achievement out of it.<p>As things at the day-job settled down, my website became a startup and it was time to join that full time. Again, management was very supportive (incidentally the same management as at Lehman).<p>I look back on my time at Lehman/Nomura with fondness and truly believe my time there gave me experience I couldn't have received anywhere else.",1365807232

5541517,comment,5541063,5541063,28,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Been there, done that, got the perf review to prove it :-)<p>A small anecdote. An acquaintance related a story of fixing the 'drainage' in their back yard. They were trying to grow some plants that were sensitive to excessive moisture, and the plants were dying. Not watering them, watering them a little, didn't seem to change. They died. A professional gardner suggested that their problem was drainage. So they dug down about 3' (where the soil was very very wet) and tried to build in better drainage. As they were on the side of a hill, water table issues were not considered. It turned out their ""problem"" was that the water main that fed their house and the houses up the hill, was so pressurized at their property (because it had maintain pressure at the top of the hill too) that the pipe seams were leaking and it was pumping gallons of water into the ground underneath their property. The problem wasn't their garden, the problem was that the city water supply was poorly designed.<p>While I have never been asked if I was an engineer on the phone, I have experienced similar things to Rachel in meetings and with regard to suggestions. Co-workers will create an internal assessment of your value and then respond based on that assessment. If they have written you off they will ignore you, if you prove their assessment wrong in a public forum they will attack you. These are <i>management</i> issues, and something which was sorely lacking in the stories.<p>If you are the ""owner"" of a meeting, and someone is trying to be heard and isn't. It is incumbent on you to let them be heard. By your position power as ""the boss"" you can naturally interrupt a discussion to collect more data from other members. Its also important to ask questions like ""does anyone have any concerns?"" to draw out people who have valid input but are too timid to share it.<p>In a highly political environment there are two ways to create change, one is through overt manipulation, which is to collect political power to yourself and then exert it to enact change, and the other is covert manipulation, which is to enact change subtly enough that the political organism doesn't react. (sometimes called ""triggering the antibodies"").<p>The problem with the latter is that if you help make positive change while keeping everyone not pissed off, no one attributes it to you (which is good for the change agent because if they knew the anti-bodies would react, but bad if your manager doesn't recognize it). I asked my manager what change he wanted to be 'true' yet he (or others) had been unsuccessful making true, he gave me one, and 18 months later that change was in place. He didn't believe that I was the one who had made the change. I suggested he pick a change he wanted to happen and not tell me, then in 18 months we could see if that one happened :-). But he also didn't understand enough about organizational dynamics to know that making change without having the source of that change point back at you was even possible.<p>The point is that one of the very important jobs of managers is to make sure that people who work for them are contributing as much positive to the company as they can, and when they are being held back from that contribution by people who are oblivious, willful or otherwise, they jump in and fix that.<p>Just another way that ""managing"" is different than ""engineering"" I suspect.",1365806370

Currency is meant to be a shared dream, since it is no more than means of exchange and means of bringing values of many things to one common measure. However, when you start treating currency as investment, the picture becomes much more complicated. Especially with bitcoin, because the value right now has long detached from any supply or demand considerations and is driven by pure speculation. As such, it is heaven for speculators, but entirely unsuitable for use as a means of exchange, since it is unpredictable and impossible to use in business which values predictability. Let's say you want to build a business that accepts bitcoins. Unless your whole supply chain is also paid in bitcoins, how can you price your products if one day bitcoin costs 45 USD, next day it's 250 USD and next day it's 80 USD? How can you predict your profits, give forecasts to investors, make long-term plans, basing your business on such huge volatility?<p>Of course, there are ways to deal with it, and there are even ways to profit from it.

I would go even further and say any business that accepts it and doesn't do it for the tax/law enforcement evasion reasons is doing it for PR reasons only.<p>>>>>  As a currency, the fundamentals are there<p>I don't understand what you mean by this. Currency as such needs no fundamentals as long as there are people willing to accept it. But currency as money is different from currency treated as an investment commodity.

Please don't talk about weakening USD - if that would be the reason we'd see rallies in all traditional physical commodities used as hedge against fiat currency - such as noble metals, and we'd see other commodities raise at least in similar manner, and we'd see it in relation to other currencies too.

A ""Vec<3>"" in C++ then is instantiated as a separate class/struct. A ""Vector<Int>"", if allowed to do it is separately compiled from a ""Vector<Double>""[1] and this is what has given templates an uncanny power in C++ as a method of doing very powerful transformations of code, as used by libraries like Eigen to unroll very complex multiple-pass algorithms into a single fast loop. Very neat stuff.<p>I would be a little surprised, actually, to see Rust implement the same feature because the way C++ has done it is by a rather curious and roundabout[2] and it was just happenstance that made it one the first widely used implementations of dependent types.

5541396,comment,5537414,5538922,3,0,drostie,,,"These are good questions! There are a lot of subtleties here. One of them is that for real one-way functions you generally get a big number and you need some sort of reduction back to the password domain. Let's call it '¬' because most fonts have that character these days. Chaining actually looks like<p>password → number ¬ new_password → new_number ¬ ...<p>Second, both the one-way function '→' and the reduction '¬' are not one-to-one mappings. This process will give you <i>a</i> preimage—i.e. given H it can give some password P such that P → H and you are happy—but that password will not necessarily be <i>the original</i> password! Usually <i>any</i> preimage will do, thankfully, but it's still a problem because this means that two different chains can 'merge' into one. This ties very closely to the question you're asking.<p>As you have surmised, 100% coverage of the input domain is also really hard to achieve because you can't control which words the one-way function (and therefore the reduction) is going to choose! Many rainbow tables just settle for some inaccuracy -- so if you cover 99.9% of the input domain, you don't worry about trying to get all of the other 0.1%.<p>The reason these two completely different-sounding things are connected is that if you think about it, if you find one of those 0.1% and feed it to your hash function and then the reduction -- there's actually a 99.9% chance that you end up on a chain you already have! So you have these super-short chains which immediately merge into other chains!<p>If you were trying to compress by a factor of 1000, then you might choose a chain length of 2000, try for 99.95% coverage, and then store these missing 0.05% as a separate lookup table -- then between the two tables you have 100% coverage. Or, you might choose a chain length of 1000 with, say, a 99% coverage, and just accept a 1% failure rate on hashes. Either one is acceptable depending on how you store the chains and how much work you want to do to ensure coverage.",1365804776

5541363,comment,5539231,5541244,11,0,tomkarlo,,,"That's not generally how it seems to work. For junior bankers under 30 (analysts and associates) you're making good money, but not such great money that you're putting away hundreds of thousands of dollars a year after your expenses and taxes. I can't recall ever hearing of someone saying, ""I've worked 5 years, I've saved $500K, but instead of making $500K next year, I'm going to retire.""<p>Also, the lifestyle (and partner, and kids) that you end up with while making banker money means that $1M is not remotely ""quitting money"", because it won't last long enough. I'd guess most folks would talk about $25M or $50M min for that in the industry, and you're not saving that anywhere below MD. Bankers have banker wives, banker mortgages, and their kids have banker tuitions. (One of my bosses had an $8M mortgage on a $12M home. That's ~$30K in mortgage payments a month... no way he could quit) I'm not saying anyone should feel bad for them, just the whole idea of ""save up $1M and quit"" doesn't make any sense in reality.<p>Finally, there's a lot of pride/ego/image folks have in their job and their job title, for better or worse. Even if it ruins their life. I didn't love being a banker, but I can't deny it's not fun telling folks you're an investment banker.<p>(Also, it's worth pointing out that people don't go work 100 hour weeks for years on end just so they can quit with $1M. They're doing it to have $10M or $100M.)",1365804347

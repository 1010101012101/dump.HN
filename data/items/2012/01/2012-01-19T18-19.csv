Every year, publishers force new editions on the market, making changes to the exercises (so old editions are incompatible with new ones) but making no substantial changes to the actual learning material. Some instructors prefer to assign old editions so their students can find cheaper copies, but most don't care, and others are even contractually obligated (via the school) to use only the newest edition.",1326999571

I don't believe textbooks would last longer than an iPad, I believe they wouldn't last nearly as long.  Textbooks fall apart, this is how the textbook industry gets revenue from replacement.  iPads generally don't fall apart.  I doubt there would be much iPad theft, and if there was, it wouldn't be too hard for Apple to provide technical solutions that make the schools iPads difficult to use and thus resell on the secondary market, much the same way the ""Find my iPhone"" lets you remotely wipe your phone.<p>If school districts opted for this feature, the iPad could simply stop working if not connected to the internet for a week, and when it does connect to the internet, it checks to see if its been stolen and if so, wipes itself and renders itself inoperable.<p>This would be relatively easy for Apple to implement and is the kind of thing they would do if they're entering into agreements to sell large numbers of iPads to school districts.<p>Thus stealing a school iPad makes little sense- the machine would  have no value after a week.<p>Edit: He proposed a problem with my perspective, I proposed a solution.

Retrograde bills like SOPA and PIPA impose an enormous negative externality on Internet service providers for the sake of preserving the failing business models of intellectual monopolists, who want the taxpayer to subsidize the cost of production in the Internet age.<p>The economic woes of the entertainment and news industries stem from longstanding trends that predate piracy on the Internet by decades. Typesetting and printing were expensive operations before the advent of word processing, electronic typesetting and low-cost on-demand publishing. Today, the marginal cost of reproducing digital content is close to zero.

3485985,comment,3485442,3485623,1,0,JunkDNA,,,"1) In US high schools, the students don't generally buy the books, the school does. They often use them for several years in a row. Publishers know this when pricing them. So on one hand, they give up the high price point, but on the other, they (maybe) get an annual stream of revenue. I say maybe because schools could likely buy iPads and load them with books, then lend those out year after year. In fact, that could be hugely economical. If you standardize around a book for 4 years or so, you can literally leave the devices ""as-is"" and not do OS updates or anything.<p>The publishers don't really have a choice. If they don't buy in, some upstart publishing house could swoop in and eat their market. Apple has just lowered the barrier to entry significantly.<p>2) This argument comes up all the time with new technology. The cost isn't going to be a factor forever. The reality is that kids of the future are going to need a computing device to get work done, especially by high school. If the recent trend is a guide, that device is likely to look more like an iPad than a desktop computer. When I was a college freshman 16 years ago), only the rich kids had cell phones. A basic cell phone can be had for a very affordable price now.<p>3) They're not looking to make money on the books. They're looking to recover costs and take on Amazon. iBooks is a backwater compared to Kindle and Apple has got to know it. The only way to compete is to do something different from what everyone else is doing. This is a classic Apple move. They didn't take on Microsoft in the enterprise with the Mac, they went after the home market which gave them more freedom to operate.",1326999106

This is generally illegal under the Sherman Act (antitrust law) in the United States (and likely in other countries, too), although, unfortunately, it is quite difficult to succeed on these sorts of claims in the US, most notably because, while a company is engaging in predatory pricing, consumers are better off since they are paying less (and a fair number of economists dont believe that predatory pricing is rational or even possible to work for various reasons).<p>Still, there are remedies for companies that engage in this behavior--maybe they'll come too late to save small publishers in this case, but they exist.",1326998637

Sanders and Lieberman both drew heavily from one of the major party's base making them de facto major party candidates and independents in name only.

Digital sensors simply murder film in every category. (You can make the argument that B&W film still has some an edge in terms of dynamic range, but considering you're matching it against RGB sensors, I'm not sure that's fair.)  Even 8x10 film is now out-resolved by medium format backs.<p>In terms of color fidelity, there is no film emulsion that will get you more accurate results than properly color-managed digital equipment.  Which is exactly why museums and people who care about accurate color reproduction use digital capture.<p>Finally, the anti-aliasing filters aren't exactly a big deal.  Yes, they degrade image quality.  Yet, even with them on most consumer sensors, those sensors still massively out-resolve, and produce sharper images, than comparable film.  Also note that most medium format backs don't have AA filters.<p>So, while somebody might like using film (or may need to in certain circumstances) the arguments presented aren't exactly the best justifications for doing so.",1326998539

Each square is a pixel in the megapixel count (a 1 megapixel sensor would have 250k red, 250k blue and 500k green photo sites). Algorithms are used to get RGB values for each pixel in that setup (luminance is extracted from the green sites). However, all the algorithms for the Bayer filter have a tendency to generate Moir patterns[2]. To combat that, most sensors have anti-alias filters in front of them. This reduces the size of detail that can resolved by a sensor, but it also prevents some of the ugly consequences of the Bayer filter.<p>Some companies have experimented with other sensors or other patterns. The new Fuji X-PRO1 is using a non-Bayer filter, which should be interesting if it works well (it also does not have an anti-alias filter).

There are a few reasons.<p>First, this brings a focused, clear path for educational content on the iPad. By opening the Books marketplace to more rich multimedia applications, Apple has made it possible for many of the dreams of interactive learning advocates to go mainstream. Imagine learning math by interacting with functions directly or doing symbolic manipulation directly. Or learning to code by actually doing it alongside a narrative. It's hard to imagine an area of study that would <i>not</i> benefit from creative use of technology in teaching it. (No, just adding videos and audio is not enough.)<p>Second, it opens the door to getting iPads in every classroom. By making it so there is a clear incentive for schools to buy iPads for all their students (cheaper, more useful textbooks) you get an iPad in the hands of every child. It goes without saying this is a big deal.<p>Finally, it opens the door for real competition for textbooks. By capping the price of textbooks at $15.00, students can easily decide to have several different treatments of the same topic on their iPad. If you manage to create content that is more clear, enjoyable, or even correct, parents and students will be one tap away from getting access to it, cheaply, if their officially-sanctioned book is not doing the job. This turns traditional textbook publishing on its head, because it empowers parents to overturn the textbook choices their school makes from the bottom up. If the entire math class has switched over to using an alternative textbook to learn a topic (just through word of mouth), this might tip the scales so the best content ends up being adopted by schools. Creative, upcoming authors will find that usurping the mainstream textbooks is now possible. I can imagine maverick publishers basically taking the same table of contents from a mainstream textbook and modernizing the treatment of the topic, so students have an easy way to move forward in their class at the same pace but with a much better learning tool.<p>And this is just what is on the top of my head, before forward thinking content creators have gotten their hands on this new platform.",1326998421

3485892,story,,,6,3,pflats,"Tell HN: Thinking about making a K-12 app now? Know how education pricing works.",,"I figure a lot of hackers out there have noticed Apple's push behind the iPad into the education market today. As an educator, I just want to make sure that those of you who are looking to make an app for the classroom, especially in the K-12 market, are aware of how schools deal with buying iOS apps.<p>First, and most importantly, unlike apps for private use, schools pay <i>per device</i> for your application. This is new for the 2011-2012 school year, so schools are feeling a lot of sticker shock. This is going to drastically affect your price point.<p>Second, schools have to pre-pay for their volume purchase, in vouchers starting at $100. Expect school systems to set a budget for apps at the beginning of the year, use one PO to buy the vouchers, and then not buy more except in very extenuating circumstances. (Your app will not be an outstanding circumstance. One by Apple or Pearson might be.) School budgets are very involiatle and only refresh once a year; if a school cannot afford your app in October, they cannot afford to buy it until the next September.<p>Third, schools do not have a way to handle in-app purchases (yet?).<p>Finally, you can choose to offer schools a 50% discount on purchases of 20+ copies of your app(and only a 50% discount, no more, no less).<p>Expect this to have a strongly downward price pressure on your app. One school I know only looks for free apps, and finds Apple's Volume Plan too cumbersome to use. My wife's school, K-8 has an app budget of somewhere just south of $1000. Their policy was: each grade level must choose, as a team, one application that costs $1.99 per unit or less. Plus free apps. That's it for the year.<p>In short, if you're looking to hit the classroom, you're probably going to need to stand out in both polish and price. Polish to get noticed above the others, price to get in under budget.<p>Links to check out:<p>Apple's FAQ: http://www.apple.com/education/volume-purchase-program/faq.html<p>Blog post on what it looks like from the educator's point of view: http://learninginhand.com/blog/app-store-volume-purchase-program-explained.html",1326998316

I was commenting on the fact that in most cases (except perhaps in extreme cases such as North Korea where governments hold their citizens captive) governments cannot be isolated from what the majority thinks or feels. Many people are uncomfortable by this so advocate the ""it's the government that did it"" argument.<p>Using the Nazis as an example was perhaps lazy (although they did get quite a bit of support from the general population, one shouldn't forget, they were <i>voted in</i>, unlike the Islamic regime in Iran). How about other examples: <i>Many</i> Chinese people in the mainland, due to an array of complex nationalistic, historical, and financial reasons back many of the deplorable aspects of China's regime. Same in Saudi Arabia, people turn a blind eye as long as they get their hefty unemployment benefits. Even France's government acknowledged Algerian atrocities very recently, because you know what, the general public still has grandiose ideas about the empire and don't want to hear that sort of thing. Turkey is going through a similar process with its Armenian history.<p>Another, longer example: I was always told that the animosity between Turkey and Greece was a thing that the governments created, that there existed a ""brotherhood of these two peoples on two sides of Aegean"". Well, when I traveled to Greece on a couple of occasions, I found the hard way that this was not completely true, people <i>did</i> hold the historical grudges), it <i>wasn't</i> something that he governments made up (same on the Turkish side, too, of course.

So before I get any further, I think artists, developers, etc. need to be compensated for their work. It should be illegal to copy someone else's digital goods and sell them for a profit (ie. copying a cd whether you paid for the original or not and reselling it). That doesn't mean I think copyright holders need to be compensated in the same way they have in the past. We're in the midst of trying to figure out how exactly to do that. Louis CK's movie, Radiohead's In Rainbows, Kickstarter... they're all examples of people trying to figure out how this all works moving forward. Some of it works, some of it doesn't. Eventually, we'll figure out a system that does.<p>We're going through a cultural shift in the way we obtain information. We forget that buying and individually owning books, movies, music, etc. is a relatively new thing and wasn't always the norm. But because there are entire industries built around these things, organizations like the RIAA and the MPAA have an obvious interest in keeping things they way they are.<p>People should be allowed to share as they want without repercussion. Some people will pay for things, others won't and some can't even if they wanted to. That's never going to change no matter how many laws are passed trying to stop it. People shouldn't be denied access to materials just because they didn't or can't pay for them.<p>Libraries are essentially what the internet has become except on a much smaller scale. One person / institution / organization buys all the books, cds, movies, etc. and lends them to others for free. Some will argue the differences is there are a limited number of copies that can be lent out at any one time. And while that's true, it's irrelevant. Just because that's the way things have been doesn't mean that's the way they need to be. As more libraries expand their digital content, the lines between our views on libraries, piracy and the sharing of information will become increasingly blurred.<p>We're living in a time when people have access to information like never before. People are being exposed to music, books and films they never would have before. We're learning things we never would have been able to 10 years ago. Walls and barriers to learning and education are being torn down. Those are all good things that we should be celebrating, not trying to destroy.",1326997702

Ascribing ill-motives to your opponents is not helpful when trying to resolve things in way that's acceptable to both sides. . .)</i><p>I actually think the opposite is true.  I think, ""what is the worst they can do with this law?""  That's what has to be acceptable to me.  Because there are a lot of ""theys,"" and somewhere somebody is going to get the idea that the law can be applied in a new way because of the way it is written.  I vaguely recall a Supreme Court decision in the '90s (or was it the '80s?) that pissed a lot of people off.  They interpreted the law as it was written, not as most people thought it was intended.  Their answer was (Scalia or somebody) ""we need to write a new law.""  I wish I could recall more.<p>The good lawyers I know are quite articulate and are capable of making themselves quite clear.  As you indicate, the law on its best day is fraught with multiple interpretations simply because as a whole it's a complex system of many interacting parts.  But each part we add should be as clear as possible.  I see passing a law with terms ill-defined as, frankly, malpractice.<p>And Turar rephrased it as he interpreted it, yes.  My point is the original should have been phrased like that if that is what they meant.  It's not beyond the authors' capabilities.  In short, I expect them to do the best they can.  When I see something like this, I don't think they are doing their best and they should be made to do it again.<p><i>But tell me, how would it have helped you if you yourself were absolutely certain (and correct) that Apple was misapplying its TOS and was in breach of contract?</i><p>Corporations can be fined for misbehaving.

For schools right now textbooks are really expensive and textbook management is expensive as well (a lot of bulk to move around and account for, etc.)  Since school districts have to pay for all this, lets do some rough numbers....<p>Lets assume you're talking about a high school, they have four grades, 9, 10, 11 & 12 and are on a semester system. How many classes does each student take a semester? 10? 7? (My high school was run like a college so my experience isn't typical. We took 10 classes each semester and had 2.5 textbooks per class (english classes often had 6-7 books)  Each class requires how many text books? 1.2? 2?<p>If we assume lower numbers for a typical high school, 4 grades, 1.2 text books per class, 2 semesters per year, 7 classes per semester and a textbook cost of $80 is 4 x 1.2 x 2 x 7 x 80 = $5,376 in text books to put one student thru the whole four years.<p>Alternatively, the school could buy one iPad, and with an average textbook cost of $15 and everything else the same the calculation is: 4 x 1.2 x 2 x 7 x 15 + $500 = $1,508.<p>We can assume in both cases, the iPad and the Texbooks last 3 years (6 semesters, and 6 different students) before having to be replaced.<p>To me, the iPad solution looks cheaper, and all the other benefits- less weight, more interactivity, etc, come for free.<p>Edit: Left out a term in the second calculation, so corrected, and using asterisks for multiplication resulted in bad formatting, so fixed.",1326997096

Said contract expired, Netflix offers $300 million to renew, and Starz rejects the offer under the premise that their content is worth more.<p>Now Starz, like HBO (eg. HBO Go), is planning to roll out their own streaming service--which I would say is both an attempt to protect their means of distribution as well as an effort to adopt to new models.<p>As an aside, I tried to use HBO Go a few weeks ago...and was prompted to enter the details of my cable tv service in order to gain access.

If someone is not comfortable with that, ok, I just don't thing people should be discouraged by that because in the end, it's not the politics that suffer but natives (current example: outage of tourism in Syria, and a few years ago, in Nepal).<p>Persepolis was great, check out other modern Iranian and Iranian/Kurdish productions, there's a bunch of awesome cinema there, to mention the most known ones: About Elly, Separation, Time of drunken horses, No One Knows About Persian Cats, Women without men, and lots of other.

This article, without even touching on annoying design and style choices, is bad. It contributes nothing to the discussion of copyright. It is four paragraphs long, and devoid of useful thought.<p>~<p>It's short enough, let's tear through it:<p><i>""over on hacker news, there are two articles in which the authors are justifying their decisions to pirate music and windows because their respective industries don't make it as easy to get hold of their content as the pirate bay does. as the first author argues ""because you are not offering a good service"" he is going to pirate his music and films from now on and ""the time has come for you to fuck off"", the second writes ""i am not buying any more software"" until microsoft ""address the service problem that is causing piracy"". ""</i><p>Okay, so, first paragraph is sloppy quoting of the articles mentioned this week at HN. The hackjob of quoting misses the flavor of the original articles, and skips some nuances. That would be fine--but it took the author an entire paragraph to sum up what could've been said in one line: ""Here and here are two articles causing discussion about piracy on Hacker News."" Done. Finished. Had they done that, I could've gotten through their miserable little post that much faster.<p><i>""
sorry what? yes, drm is broken. yes, copyright doesn't work very well. yes, pirating is easier. since when does that suddenly mean that you can decide that you are no longer going to pay for products that both legally and morally you are obliged to pay for, yet still use them? i am steering clear of the word 'steal' because many will argue that it is not 'stealing' under the strict definition of the word; the content creator still has the song, software etc. ""</i><p>The author says, in effect, ""suck it up, stop pirating.""<p>The author does so with some hilarious painful-to-read phrasing. I'm not asking for art, mind you, in all posts--I just prefer that the written word (especially when submitted to HN!) have something behind it more than mallspeak.<p>In addition to being worded like a petulant teenager angry about missing the last ship to the Pirate Bay, the author claims that there is a moral obligation to pay for material, but doesn't explain what that obligation is or from what it derives.<p>The author doesn't so much assail the idea of piracy as show a sort of slow-witted wonder that you can get copies of things without buying them. Drooling into the keyboard and blinking, it slowly dawns on the imbecile that people can do this. The author comes <i>dangerously</i> close to diverging onto a useful thought about the nature of stealing and how it applies to copyright infringement, but then manages at the last minute to pull ignorance from the jaws of victory and flits off to the next paragraph.<p><i>""
if you want to protest the crappy way these companies treat their customers, don't buy their stuff. but you can't have your cake and eat it. protest by not using or having it at all. they have something you want; even if you don't agree with their methods, it is still theirs to decide what to do with. all you are doing is supporting the industry in their drive to stamp out pirates; instead, support legal ways of obtaining this content through spotify and others. ""</i><p>The author makes several assertions again here: companies treat their customers badly, piracy isn't effective, piracy somehow supports the industry, companies can decide what they can do with their IP unconditionally, etc.<p>This is talking-point vomit, a pile of mealy-mouthed and poorly-articulated sayings lacking backing or explanation. This contributes nothing to the conversation, and serves only to underscore the intellectual laziness of the author.<p>These claims are all very interesting and exciting to debate, mind you, but that requires an attention span and maturity that the author seems to simply not have.<p><i>""
if there is no legal way for you to enjoy it, unfortunate though it is, tough.
write to them. email them. call them to protest. but don't decide to take the law into your own hands...it's not your decision. ""</i><p>At last, sweet release!<p>The author has finished the article with a stunted attempt at encouraging protest, and yet again manages to miss a wonderful opportunity to consider the role of piracy as peaceful protest. The author also makes some baseless assertions without provided reasoning in regards to ""taking the law into your own hands"" and its desirability--again, an interesting philosophical starting point lost on the moron penning the paragraph.<p>~<p>Look, I'm not going to launch into crazy copyright and anti-copyright discussion here, but for fuck's sake can we start posting articles on this topic that try to display critical thought?<p>This is insulting.",1326996277

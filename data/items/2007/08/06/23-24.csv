39935,comment,39927,39927,0,0,nostrademons,,,"A few that I know of:<p>#1 took the IP of his failed startup to China and tried starting another business in exactly the same area, but with Chinese programmers instead of American.  Last I heard it hadn't gone anywhere (for exactly the same reasons that the first failed), but money lasts 5 times as long in China.<p>#2 - a cofounder in the same startup - went to China and opened a school, along with consulting for numerous businesses there.  His new venture is doing great.<p>(#1 and #2 are both independently wealthy from previous startups, however.)<p>#3 ended up being hired by the business he tried to compete against.<p>#4 did some consulting work and then took a visiting professorship at a university.<p>#5 slunk back to the cube farm, then was laid off in the next recession and became a househusband.<p>#6 slunk back to the cube farm.<p>Something you should remember: many businesses (particularly ones that don't take outside funding) neither succeed nor fail, but limp along with enough revenues to pay a small staff but not enough to grow quickly.  You should be prepared for this possibility and know whether you would want to abandon the startup and go back to the cube farm, or stick it out in hopes of one day making a breakthrough.  For startups that are not in hot markets, you'll find that they're significantly more work than a regular job with not much more pay (though you do have more freedom).  I know at least 2 other entrepreneurs in this category.<p>As for the best way to manage the possibility of failure: keep your skills sharp, and make sure that you fail because of things you can't prevent rather than things you can.  Most big companies will eagerly hire a top-notch hacker who failed because there was no market for what he was building.  Not many will hire someone who had a top-notch market and yet sat on his ass all day instead of building something.",1186444401

Because I recently switched off my cable tv in hopes of being more productive, but my answer to your question would be ""pretty easily"".  Actually, now that I think about, the time when I was most susceptible was when I spent a lot of time surfing productivity blogs; those are rife with those kind of posts.  ",1186442673

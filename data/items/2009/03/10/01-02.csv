News to my bosses.  ;)  I've had a day job for the entire duration.<p>I started being consistently ramen profitable about 28 months after starting.  (Last October-ish.)  In February I hit my next milestone, which was ""sales > salary"".  I'm hoping to hit ""profits > salary"" sometime before the end of April.<p>I've only ever had one product.  I've tried making two others in the interim, but they got put on the back burner for a variety of reasons.  Someday.<p>Stuff of interest: I don't know what you find interesting, but my blog is in my profile if you want the whole story.

509358,comment,505321,506228,0,0,sho,,,"Good idea, but I see three problems:<p>1. Chicken and egg: Until such a feature is ubiquitous, labels can't rely on its presence, and won't release in a suitable format. Until there is demand, player manufacturers won't include it. And I don't see much independent consumer demand.<p>2. There is no one algorithm or processing technique which will give optimal results for all inputs. The process is still an art requiring a lot of skill and, well, taste. Mastering is still a real necessity. There's crude automated compression, sure, but for the real end product I don't think anyone wants that.<p>3. The sound is already mixed at the consumer end. For successful remastering (which is basically what you're doing on the fly) the separate tracks would be needed. For example, in an otherwise uncompressed track, a distorted electric guitar is pretty much naturally compressed. Drums are the opposite. Naively just compressing the whole thing will keep the guitar and lose the drums. I'm really oversimplifying here but hopefully you get the picture.<p>I do think such an approach could work, but you'd need to supply the mixable tracks, or relevant groups of them at least, and then supply mixing/compression instructions to the player. If the instructions were standardised with fairly predictable and consistent results, that could be a way to implement such a scheme.",1236647830

It was subtle, but if you have looked at Machiavelli's original political theory, you notice it has been grossly mischaracterized in today's society. If I were to sum up what Machiavellian means, in the traditional sense, I would say it is prudence, ability, effort, and fortunate circumstance.<p>In a previous post, pg revealed a situation where applying ideas created more ideas and this is perfect because it has nothing to do with theory, it has everything to do with authentic experience.

509350,comment,508918,509326,0,0,ams6110,,,"As a developer on the receiving end of ""stories"" I find that a few sentences on an index card are, in most cases, woefully inadequate at describing the desired functionality.  So what happens is you end up going back and forth to the PM with your questions, which is inefficient, OR you make assumptions to fill in the gaps, which sometimes works out well and sometimes does not.<p>On the other hand I've also had the unhappy experience of wading through dense, arcane specification documents written in stilted language (""the system shall...."" ad nauseum) that are ultimately not much better.<p>In the end I think what this illustrates is that writing a good, concise, clear, complete functional specification is not easy.  It requires a talented PM and no formulaic approach, whether it is agile or anything else, can get around that.",1236646875

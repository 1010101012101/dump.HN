9965806,comment,9961613,9961613,0,0,rabbyte,,,"Native emulation has been a goal of the web from the beginning. I can recall several efforts as far back as &#x27;96 to create websites to replace desktop apps and we arguably achieved that around 2005 with apps like Google Maps or Writely. Two years before the iPhone was released we were chasing the tail of &quot;native&quot;. The web vs native debate skips over the idea that these two worlds actually inform each other and are largely populated by the same developer community.<p>As an industry, I think people are starting to place more value on the comprehensibility of software over its capability and that&#x27;s where I think PPK hits home here. When you&#x27;re building to satisfy immediate needs it makes sense to eventually stop and revisit your implementation to make sure (1) those needs are still relevant and (2) your implementation adequately satisfies them. That&#x27;s what I see this as, not a call to stop chasing native, but a call for replacing the patchwork with comprehensible design. I think that&#x27;s perfectly reasonable and I would go so far as to say we should build it in as a cultural value to pause every 10 years to both celebrate what we&#x27;ve accomplished and refine the result.",1438134818

False positives will lead to personnel confusion, and false <i>negatives</i> will lead to dead swimmers.<p>This isn&#x27;t to mention that automation does encourage complacency.  One of the primary reasons for the recent Malaysia Air jet disappearances according to investigations is an excessive reliance upon automated systems to fly planes, and insufficient knowledge of flying without such tools.  I reckon a similar situation could be a real danger here as well (if not amplified considerably; most lifeguards (at least where I&#x27;ve lived) were usually highschool students doing it as an extracurricular/volunteer activity, summer job, etc., and teenagers aren&#x27;t exactly known for having an above-average attention span).",1438134354

9965777,comment,9957486,9957948,0,0,joeykrug,,,"One example of an app you&#x27;d want to run on ethereum is something like a prediction market (PM).  A PM is a pretty general financial market and can be used to speculate on things from &quot;Who will become the US President in 2016?&quot; to &quot;Will Russia invade Estonia by 2020?&quot; to &quot;Will American Pharoah win the Triple Crown?&quot;<p>Ethereum is useful for this because it allows for distributed custody of funds.  No one controls the funds stored in these contracts, so there&#x27;s no one to run away with and steal all the money, and, since it&#x27;s run on Ethereum, there&#x27;s no middleman taking 5-10% fees.  In fact, for the first time, we can have a truly global prediction market, and _anyone_ can create markets on it to boot!  This is just one app possible on ethereum, and it&#x27;s one I&#x27;m building - www.augur.net if you&#x27;re interested.<p>Ethereum&#x27;s basically a platform that allows you to create &quot;smart contracts&quot; (aka programs) that are practically guaranteed to execute the way you write them.  And multiple people can interact with the programs and it&#x27;ll still be executed the same way.  This is a bit abstract, but the main huge advantage this allows is: you can finally send money to some program, and the program will do exactly what it says it will, and no one else can modify the results or even touch your money.  Bitcoin allows you to send money around, Ethereum allows you to enter into complex contracts with money, and those contracts are always enforceable.<p>To take this into the real world, imagine you want to make a bitcoin prediction market.  Since you can&#x27;t run the complicated buy/sell machinery of a prediction market directly on bitcoin, you&#x27;re forced to take deposits from users, match their orders, and then do payouts accordingly after the event occurs.  You can run away with the funds at any time, and there&#x27;s nothing stopping you.  Sure, you could elect to use multisignature wallets or cold storage, but that didn&#x27;t stop MtGox from happening.  Heck, even InTrade, the largest prior prediction market had millions of dollars of funds embezzled by their later CEO.<p>Now with Ethereum, we can send funds to a contract, they&#x27;re stored there.  You can buy and sell and all orders go through the contract.  At the end payouts are done by the code in the contract, and no one can take the funds held in the contract.",1438134303

9965775,comment,9964850,9965467,0,0,mattzito,,,"> Phones and cloud services aren&#x27;t in competition, they&#x27;re complimentary services -- phones create demand for cloud services.<p>Sure, from the standpoint that devices create demand for computing services, which these days are delivered via the cloud.  But there&#x27;s a lot less of an inherent advantage that Microsoft has in that environment.<p>On top of that, the money to be made is a lot lower.  Let&#x27;s throw out a scenario here - Microsoft trades its OS dominance for a dominance in cloud computing.  They lose all of their OS revenue (unlikely to happen) in exchange for having a huge chunk of the cloud computing market (also unlikely to happen).<p>If we model this out - Amazon AWS in 2015 will make roughly $6b in revenue, which is about 10% of the total public cloud market in 2015 according to IDC   In 2018, this market is supposed to be 128b.  Let&#x27;s say that Microsoft in 2018 has 2x Amazon&#x27;s current market share, which would be a huge success by any measure, that gives them ~$24b in revenue.<p>Which is half of what they made in business software licensing in 2014.  <i>Half</i>.  They made 40 billion just on the business licensing end of their traditional software business.<p>I fully believe Microsoft will continue to live and innovate and potentially succeed in this brave new world, but it will do so at a huge long-term impact to its revenue and size.",1438134246

I can&#x27;t argue with the Ars article on batteries, although I wonder if it&#x27;s really worth using Li-Ion batteries for homes when lead-acid is super simple, and I think cheap, (I&#x27;m not sure if the acid&#x27;s recyclable, though).<p>The first linked article talks about storage, not generation - is it the correct link? If we can get solar into the $0.02 - $0.04 range we&#x27;ll have largely won the battle.<p>On shrinking wilderness, I&#x27;m not sure about some of the methodology in that paper. For land use in agriculture it seems to have tailored the timescale studied to support the theory that we&#x27;re using less land for agriculture, but even the selective charts show we&#x27;re almost at peak corn acreage and headed up-and-to-the-right. The argument about saying cubic yards of wood production per hectare of forest is going up was missing a timescale, and charting wood used per dollar of GDP doesn&#x27;t really tell us anything about how much wood is actually being used, it just makes a chart that looks like its heading in the right direction. I think the US may be seeing less land under agriculture, but I think a lot more food is being imported from Central & South America, and Asia, areas that were not discussed in relation to area under agriculture. I didn&#x27;t look up the reputation of thebreakthrough.org, but the paper read somewhat like a &quot;we&#x27;re doing fine - stop worrying&quot; study influenced by parties that don&#x27;t want rapid change.<p>There have been some major wins on the wilderness vs. non-wilderness front, though. Many waterways in North America is probably cleaner than it was 30 years ago, (think of the Great Lakes, and around NYC. I&#x27;m not sure about the Mississippi, Columbia, or Colorado river systems). Acid rain on the east coast & central Canada has largely been dealt with, and some species are even coming back to places they&#x27;ve been gone from for years, (I caught a salmon on vacation in BC last year for the first time in 20 years).",1438134063

Each region of uncertainty then becomes a subsystem. Put interfaces between the subsystems that need to be connected.

It&#x27;s a hobby of mine :)<p>> When I got my first PC, my choice was: MS-DOS 3.3. QuickBasic, Pascal, C or Assembler for writing programs.<p>Indeed, though those weren&#x27;t the only choices even back then.  Lots of different microcomputers, all with their unique dialects of BASIC, up until the late 80&#x27;s and early 90&#x27;s, when the diversity died off and IBM-compatibles became the norm.<p>Really, the current evolution in software is more just a resurrection of the diversity once strong in the realm of computers.  Back then, one would actually have to make conscious choices about CPU architecture of all things; nowadays (for better or worse), we seem to be resigned to the idea of big machines being x86(-64) and little machines being ARM or <i>maybe</i> MIPS.<p>Not to say that languages weren&#x27;t diverse back then, either.  You still had Lisp and FORTRAN and COBOL and Forth and C and assembly and PL/I and ALGOL and Pascal and Logo (turtle power!).  A little later there was C++ and Perl and Tcl to join them as some others faded out.<p>Basically, the evolution now is less about the <i>quantity</i> of platforms to develop for and more about the <i>accessibility</i> of those platforms.  Pretty much all the good ones are open-source, available on the internet, and have plenty of online documentation.  The free software and open source movements have been a boon to those seeking to get their foot in the door.<p>> unless something absolutely mind blowing comes up and replaces everything forever.<p>I suspect that &quot;something&quot; will either be artificially intelligent or pretty damn close to it.  Development time and effort will decrease substantially if a programmer can just tell his artificially-intelligent software maker what the program needs to do - in a natural language - and the software-maker goes and makes a program.  I suspect there will be a couple of stepping stones before that, including some existing stepping stones that we&#x27;ve already walked on.  One of them is LLVM, providing a common core that any language can use with relatively-few obstacles.  Another is the concept of programs that create other programs; languages like Ruby, Tcl, and Lisp facilitate this quite well, and it&#x27;s probably a matter of time before those and similar languages are used to do things like automatically generate HTML/CSS/JS for web apps (as one example of potential usefulness in the short term).  Natural language parsing by artificial electrical systems is getting better and better, too.",1438133374

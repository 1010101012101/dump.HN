When the software company I founded was at about $650,000 in annual revenue, I was convinced that it was time to bring in a seasoned leader who knew how to take the business to the next level because I, as a first-time entrepreneur, had certainly not done it before.<p>In retrospect, that mentality was a mistake.  The truth is that you understand the business better than anyone else and there is no magical skill or talent that someone else can bring to the table that will so fundamentally improve things.<p>Do not make the mistake of thinking that if you <i>transfer</i> responsibility to &quot;better&quot; executive that they can do a better job.  That person will bring their own strengths/weaknesses to the table.  They will need to rely on a team to make up for their handicaps just as you are looking to do.<p>In this situation, I recommend the following:<p>- First, clearly identify exactly what issues are vexing you.  If it seems like &quot;everything&quot; or &quot;things are just overwhelming&quot; then make a list of just the most important issues.<p>- Then pick 1 or 2 or 3 that you can actually focus on solving.  You can&#x27;t do more than that at once, but imagine how much impact fixing your top 3 issues will make on the business!  In fact, you should try to quantify how much money you are losing or missing out on by not resolving these issues to give yourself a sense of what you should budget to solve them<p>- Then block out or delegate everything else, and focus 100% of your creative energies on how you can resolve these issues.  Use any and all resources available to you, including friends, consultants, or even Hacker News ;-)  If you don&#x27;t even know where to begin on an issue, then find an expert for THAT ISSUE (which is different than finding a new CEO).<p>- Then keep at it, keep refining your ideas, listen to your intuition, and push through until you make progress.<p>I made the mistake of thinking other businesspeople were &quot;better&quot; than me or more talented than I am.  The truth is you just need to know what your strengths/weaknesses are.  Then lean on the team around you or new people to help you fill in the weaknesses.<p>Hope this helps,<p>Josh",1373767172

In the U.S. you cannot even sell weapons across state lines without a license. Many countries also restrict the sale of even low-level devices likely to be used for sabotage, e.g. molotov cocktails, and that may extend to marginal sabotage devices like spray paint as well. Burglary tools are another example of a restricted device that has some analogies.<p>Lots of what the &quot;security industry&quot; does would land them in jail in any other field, even if it were selling low-level burglary devices to car thieves.

You might get worse-than-linear for certain types of RAM issues (more swapping, etc), but this wouldn&#x27;t be the same as saying there&#x27;s an exponential slowdown, and it&#x27;s not a hard fact about the simulation algorithms themselves.<p>Anyway, the point isn&#x27;t that classical computers are just less powerful, the point is that they&#x27;re so fundamentally different that calculating quantum phenomena can become <i>actually</i> impossible (as in, process will not finish before the heat death of the universe) relatively quickly as the size of the problem increases.",1373766426

However, I don&#x27;t think suggestions like &quot;Call your Congressman&quot; are viable, and that&#x27;s what I often get.<p>If we could get all the productive people in the country to refuse to put up with this shit and go on strike, we could do something. If everyone in the NSA and the military had the scruples and moral principles of Snowden, we could end this shit overnight. But there is too little agreement.

Every day that I write, I remember them, and wish I had them around to improve my prose. But this is the Internet and we no longer have editors.<p>PC World deserves a eulogy and a better one than this from its archival Ziff-Davis. In those days, magazines created communities. Readers became part of a magazine&#x27;s world, identifying themselves, forming affinity groups, despite geographic isolation, and without barriers to participation. Something like Hacker News in that regard. The publisher, the editors, the writers, and the advertisers fostered the creation of the community, and the communities created by the computer magazines of the 1980s and 1990s created our technology culture as much, and maybe more, than any single individual or Silicon Valley company. Yes, we say Steve Jobs was a genius, but part of his genius was realizing he needed David Bunnell, the founder of PC World and a former radical political organizer, to create a magazine for the Mac if his new computer was going to succeed. The dirty secret of that time was that Steve Jobs paid Bunnell to publish MacWorld (and later, NeXTWORLD) and the Apple community arose from it.

For example, in the opening paragraph, you open with &quot;Make your AngularJS, EmberJS, or BackboneJS website Crawlable by Google&quot; and then after some picture-painting for the reader, you go in for the kill with &quot;Right now Google can&#x27;t see your website. You could change that in just a few minutes.&quot;<p>If you swap those two sentences, the entire package becomes a lot more persuasive. There&#x27;s a boatload of similar opportunities through the rest of the page that should be pretty easy to spot, too.<p>Congrats on finding your focus and pushing ahead!",1373763963

I see four items.<p>The first, dated four days ago (and the only I see one preceeding this), is a title making some sort of claim about Booz Hamilton based on a whois lookup. Not exactly a quality submission, but it has nothing to do with Iran or hacking.<p>The other three submissions are all about what seems to be some news he&#x27;s stumbled on about hacking/reverse engineering claims from Iran.<p>Considering this is &#x27;Hacker&#x27; news, you can understand why he might think we&#x27;d be interested in this. Of course, it would be better form for him to write up an article explaining the separation or link between these items rather than posting lots of direct evidence.<p>None of that means he should expect to have his privacy breached by a US intelligence agency, and frankly your support for that on the basis of such a flimsy characterisation is blood-chilling.<p>A lot of people seem to have become alarmed because they&#x27;ve seen persian text and heard that it&#x27;s about hacking. That&#x27;s equally chilling.<p>Is this all it takes?",1373763755

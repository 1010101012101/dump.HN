If you have a newer version of Word that does .docx files, you have to save as the older .doc files, because some recipients will complain that they can't open the newer ones. And if you're on the older one yourself, you have trouble opening stuff people send you. Whenever Word files go out to a distribution of more than two or so people including some external collaborators, I've always had problems. Afaict, Word on the Mac also behaves differently from Word on Windows, at least in terms of who reports back to me that they can't open a file I sent, and god help you if you try to embed media or use the reference manager.<p>Honestly OpenOffice users give me the fewest problems, because they seem to be able to at least <i>open</i> anything I send them, even if the formatting is a bit mangled, while a significant percentage of Word users report back with ""I couldn't open your file"" or ""your file seemed corrupt"" or something.",1298300265

I've worked pretty hard, and still only have a smattering of other languages.  I've never really had the chance or reason to develop fluency in anything other than my native tongue, so cherish your ability.  You probably can't - from the inside - realise quite what advantages it bestows.<p>And that's my second point.  Many of you are saying that you don't think it's significantly affected your ability to multi-task, but <i>you can't know.</i>  This is why science demands proper double-blind randomized trials.  You don't know what you would be like without your bilingualism, so you don't know how - or if - it's affected you.  Maybe without your bilingualism you'd be a lot worse at multi-tasking.  Or a lot better.  You can't tell.<p>I have various skills, and I believe that some have helped, and perhaps some have hindered, my programming, but I certainly can't tell.<p>See also <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2244178"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2244178</a> where there's a report that bilingualism seems to delay the onset of Alzheimer's.",1298300178

That being said, I'm not sure why I should care more about culture than my actual work. I obviously want a certain work climate (no annoying micro-management, smart and friendly co-workers etc.), but that should be possible in big companies in startups, no?<p>> What if the company needs to pivot and you are no longer working on whatever excited you about coming to work on day zero? Will you start looking for somewhere else?<p>Honestly: If it is a massive change for the worse, why wouldn't I? Example: I am interested in algorithms and low-level bit-fiddly stuff. I don't particularly care about HCI and web design. If I was to join a company that works on, say, databases and file systems, I would probably do it with the expectation to work on the kind of problems I find interesting.

Doesn&#x27;t mean I don&#x27;t think e.g. IS needs to be countered, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;ll get countered by snooping - on the contrary, it will fuel the paranoia of those that are intrigued by their cause.<p>To take a personal example: In my youth I was member of a marxist group. The knowledge that Norwegian intelligence services carried out extensive surveillance of the members of lots of left wing organizations (highly illegally, as it happens - but while the extent of their illegal surveillance was first &quot;discovered&quot; years later, everyone in the organisations in question knew about it; just that nobody believed them) did not deter me. On the contrary: It made me more certain my decision was correct: It was evidence of the oppression I was against.<p>The organisation in question was (and is) fully legal, participating in elections, and does not (and did not) advocate violence in any way, but I don&#x27;t believe the overall principle is different: If someone is considering a cause opposed by government, then surveillance will not stop most of them, but spur them on and prove to them that they can not trust their own government.",1431964549

If I understand you correctly, you claim that local transport options in Europe and the US cannot be compared. Why is that?<p>In some cases it can be, but that&#x27;s where the issues of density and context/surroundings really come into play.  In order for a transit line to be viable, you have to a critical mass of people willing to use it.  It&#x27;s inefficient to run trains and busses with no passengers, so schedules are reduced, which makes things less convenient for users.<p>In my experience, there actually ARE local public transit systems in the US.  Most of them use busses, but they exist.  Most people don&#x27;t use the public transit unless they have to, though, because cars are so much easier and more convenient.  And while more investment into transit could make it more attractive, there are still issues and limits on how much it would actually be used due to the generally fewer number of people with access to any one transit line, as well as the destinations available from the pickup spot.",1431964423

Smoother & faster. And the rendering quality is also superior to dynmap&#x27;s.<p>Dynamp is, however, dynamic. Overviewer is an offline renderer, basically. You need to cron-job it or whatever, so there are delays in the map updating. Dynmap, on the other hand, is a plugin to the server itself, so it updates whenever a chunk in the game updates. This is how it also is able to have player locations and chat and stuff.<p>But this also requires plugin support to use dynmap. Overviewer can easily work with hosted solutions. You can pull down a copy of the world from your hosted minecraft instance and run overviewer on it nightly, so you don&#x27;t have to take on hosting minecraft yourself.<p>However, if you are going the modded-minecraft route (FTB or whatever), dynamp is low-effort and since it uses the game engine itself to render has built-in support for all the crazy textures & blocks that mods add. Overviewer does not.<p>tl;dr: If you&#x27;re running vanilla Minecraft, use Overviewer. If you&#x27;re running modded Minecraft (FTB, Technic, etc...) use Dynmap.",1431963965

I don&#x27;t know your circumstances, but when I read a critique like this my first question is always &quot;where has the person travelled?&quot;. It&#x27;s very difficult to spend time in places devoid of capitalism and not notice the differences. Due to my past work, I travelled all over the globe to both established and emerging markets -- and work simply can&#x27;t explain the levels of disparity. What repeatedly made a difference was ownership. For example, the poverty in Addis Ababa is overwhelming. Once you get past that, the second thing you&#x27;ll likely notice is that the government has a tight grip over business there. There are no McDonalds, Starbucks, or any recognizable brands there. This is for the &quot;benefit of the people&quot;, but really is just there to protect government interests (the coffee place nearly has the exact same Starbucks logo). In one area where there were nice homes, a single individual owned the entire lot of them. Unlike the US where you might be able to acquire property or make free choices about a new business, your choices are restricted there. There is much talk in the US about the top 1%, but this defines the &quot;99%&quot; by limiting the sample size to only those living within capitalism. On a global scale, the top 1% is anyone making over $34k a year.",1431963817

A nation is more than place to make money, rather it is a <i>home</i> for an extended family.  Economic arguments quantify away the essence of a nation: a living space set aside for the well being of progeny.  Either a people is in control of its inheritance, or, its inheritance is being subsumed by another tribe.  When viewed in these terms, rather than flourishing since the second World War, the United States has in fact been on a path to dissolution.  And one can do better than a URL for proof of this; go to Southern California, open your eyes, and be honest.  There is a reason Southern California&#x27;s Anglo middle class paradise of 1880-1970 is now a squalid Latin American sweatshop; demographics is destiny.  Calcutta is Calcutta because Calcuttans live there.  Detroit is Detroit because Southern Blacks now live there.  Etc.<p>If this does not ring true to you, feel free to disagree with me, but please, try the alleged benefits of demographic substitution somewhere where economists will feel the pinch themselves.  Given the large number of Jewish economists I&#x27;ve read over the years, Israel would be a prime testbed (if the nation wasn&#x27;t currently sterilizing and exiling their Black Ethiopian populace).  Middle class gentile globalists could start by opening the floodgates to their own gated communities and HOAs before gleefully replacing their &quot;unwilling worker&quot; blue-collar cousins.<p>>If we&#x27;re going to talk about demographics, you should also consider the fact that the US is facing a shortage of younger workers relative to retirees<p>This thinking is completely backward, IMHO.  The economy serves the people, the people do not serve the economy.  The means is not the ends.  If a people cannot afford to have sufficient numbers of children, the problem is not with the people, its with the (usurious) economy.  The economy needs to be replaced, not the people.",1431963786

But my point was that an absolutist stance is simplistic. So let&#x27;s change it to government censorship: an absolute stance with no restrictions on freedom of speech now means that there is now no longer any confidential or secret information. No need for spies - senior government employees can just sell national secrets to the highest bidder, and if they&#x27;re found out, hey, speech is not restricted. They can&#x27;t lose their jobs - or even suffer reduced chance of advancement - because that would be seen as a punishment, a restriction of speech.

9564820,comment,9562684,9562684,0,0,Dewie3,,,"> Watching him reminded me of an oft-ignored piece of advice: Learn by doing what you love. Obsession is key when it comes to mastering programming (or anything). While it’s perfectly fine to choose this career path as just that—a career—it also takes a level of dedication and excitement that can’t be generated without a natural spark.<p>Or you could use a mixture of natural inclination, as well as trying your best to adapt to the situation and deal with it in a positive manner.<p>I suspect that the author&#x27;s approach is too reactive, and doesn&#x27;t work for anyone but those who happened to be lucky enough to stumble upon something that they love doing in their childhood or early adulthood, and then it happened to actually be employable. Not to mention, even if you loved programming <i>as a teenager</i> and/or <i>in university</i> and/or <i>on OSS</i>, that doesn&#x27;t mean that you will love programming in &quot;the industry&quot;[1], which might be a different experience then what you are used to. Then what are going to do? Rely on this reactive attitude of &quot;either I am naturally inclined to like this thing, or it isn&#x27;t for me at all&quot;? Well that might have been enough for you to learn the ropes and such, but it might be a crushing blow to find out that you don&#x27;t fall immediately <i>in love</i> with whatever programming you find in paid work, or the programming that you have to do for you physics research, or whatever else you find yourself needing programming for. Then what are you supposed to do? Go back to school for another 2-5 years, change profession, or maybe stop being so reactive and start to find pleasure in whatever things you might think is your natural kryptonite, but actually might be a more superficial disinclination which can be learned or unlearned.<p>Programmers are supposedly so passionate. Or at least supposedly a large subset of them. But for such a <i>passionate</i> group, they sure seem to often default to reactively being upset and cranky and cynical over whatever facet of their programming experience they don&#x27;t like.<p>[1] I use &quot;the industry&quot; as an example here purely because it tends to come later in the programming lives of <i>passionate programmrs</i>, not because it is necessarily terrible compared to other forms of programming. Indeed, I don&#x27;t have any industry experience yet myself, and such fears that &quot;You might like programming in university or whatever, but will you like it when you actually have to use it to support yourself?&quot; has been a worry of mine for some time now.",1431961257

5003552,comment,5003258,5003258,1,0,felipe,,,"This is an excellent concept that targets a real pain-point I faced many times, which is: How to properly lay-out or template emails without the pain of actually sending transactional emails through SMTP and looking at them in the client (Gmail, mobile, etc...). This also prevents designers and programmers to collaborate, so your concept would allow designers and marketeers to design and change email layouts independently from the programmer, which is another pain-point for non-developers.<p>Having said that, it seems that you expect the app to use your SMTP, and IMHO that's a deal-breaker. Once an app or company is already using a SMTP provider, changing to an unknown one (which could impact deliverability and so on) is a deal-breaker. However, if you provide a tool that somehow the marketing dept can change templates which then the developers can somehow fetch into the source codebase, now that would be (I think) a good value.<p>I am a software developer (not a designer nor marketeer) so I may not be the target user for this tool, but I think it would be valuable for developers too.",1357235871

Candidates of Party Z may split the vote in the primary, against a candidate from Party A who takes the plurality (say, 40%, or all non-gerried votes).  However, this challenger would lose to the winning Party Z candidate in the election.<p>In states with open primaries but no gerrymandering restrictions, the districts are generally designed such that the party out-of-power does not have the vote in any particular district to carry a plurality in the primary.  Generally, this is accomplished by gerrying all of the minority party's voters into a single district where that party has an obscence supermajority.",1357235656

Top universities are not going anywhere, nor is their prestige. If that were the case, why would MIT/Harvard/Stanford/Yale publish their courses in this manner? They wouldn't.<p>The reason top universities are not only willing to publicly release their courses, but <i>competing</i> with each other to do so, is simple. The mission of these universities is to educate. Publishing courses as MOOCs accomplishes enables that mission. It also has the added benefit of creating publicity for the school.<p>To say that MOOCs are ""disrupting higher education"" implies that the universities are commoditizing their education. They are not. They are commoditizing the <i>academic</i> portion of their education. In my experience at Yale, the academic portion of my education has accounted for no more than 10% of it. Academics are not what universities are in the business of teaching. That's why you can't replace a university education with a set of online courses.<p>My daily life consists of no more than 2 hours of class. Yet I wake up at 9 and go to bed at 12. That's 13/15 hours in the day NOT spent in class. During that time is when I'm reaping the benefits of a Yale education. They are largely intangible, but very obvious in retrospect. They are skills for navigating through life. Yale teaches you strong social skills, encourages you to step outside your comfort zone, introduces you to what can only be described as an absurd network of people, and how to manage all of that in the course of a day. I've learned more about myself the past three years than I ever could have through online courses. And THAT is why MOOCs will never disrupt the traditional higher education system.",1357235337

It makes sense to bring it out where we could potentially reuse it later.<p>This is just object orientation 101, and it preaches the flexibility that the OP is against.

Far easier (at the time) to tell the compiler in advance about signatures than to force it to compile everything twice to find them (which is, roughly speaking, what Java does, except the second ""compilation"" happens at run time).<p>ObjC is a truer OO, IMO, because it focuses more on objects and message passing rather than method calls. As Categories and optional protocols show, this provides a far more flexible approach.<p>The conditional compilation comment confuses me and makes me think you don't really understand what's happening under the hood. When you compile Java, you get byte code tat requires a VM. When you compile ObjC, you get native code. Now imagine dealing with an architecture as different as PowerPC and x86. All those differences were conditionally compiled into your VM. In ObjC, you need to deal with them yourself (and all the other positives and negatives that implies).",1357234246

Right now I doubt you're in a position to know for sure if you ever want kids or decent furniture or to live by yourself. You may even discover that you enjoy working and want to have a career past age 35, an age which probably seems much older from your vantage than mine.<p>I think the HN community in general tends to underrate the value of college in developing the kind of soft skills (project management, playing well with others, critical thinking, learning how to study something new, writing & presentation skills) that make a real difference in how good an employee/manager/co-founder can be. I would never hire anyone without at least a few years college experience - even if they kick ass at one or two things, they would probably not be as prepared to develop into new roles and skills.<p>Also, college gives you the opportunity to engage with subjects and people outside of your current interests/peers - whether or not that has a direct impact on your career/life, it will likely make you a more empathetic, tolerant and interesting human being.",1357232777

A work of art is created by definition to be beautiful. While a beautiful UI is awesome and definitely something to strive for, it is not the end goal.<p>2. A UI can be changed after its release. Unlike art, you can release a UI and then later change details that are important.<p>3. Most companies do not have the manpower or time to actually get to the place where the entire product is pixel-perfect. pg's mantra is: ""release early."" This means that not everything is going to be perfect and you have to decide what corners can be cut and which cannot. (You cannot simply state, I am going to cut NO corners).<p>4. A UI is likely to change. When you first release a UI you dont really know how it is going to be used. Therefore, as the OP suggests the improvement from 95%-98% really does seem like a pre-optimization.<p>That said, the UI should make the experience easier in that it aids the function. I would take it a little beyond that where you want something attractive to look at, but it doesnt necessarily need to be in the v1. As the UI matures over time beauty in design becomes a more important goal.",1357232568

9567669,comment,9566064,9566064,0,0,nickpsecurity,,,"One thing that bothers me about the article is that it shows a recurring problem: IT not knowing what it knows. The NoSQL movement didn&#x27;t notice that NonStop Architecture scaled linearly to thousands of cores with strong-consistency, five 9&#x27;s, and SQL support. In the mid-80&#x27;s. Instead of making a low-cost knockoff, like cluster movement did for NUMA&#x27;s, they ditched consistency altogether and launched NoSQL movement. Now, I see man who invented CAP theorem discuss it while referencing all kinds of NoSQL options to show us the tradeoffs. Yet, there&#x27;s Google services in production and tech such as FoundationDB doing strong consistency with distributed, high throughput and availability.<p><a href=""http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/11/22/foundationdb_fear_of_cap_theorem/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/11/22/foundationdb_fear_of...</a><p>So, why aren&#x27;t such techs mentioned in these discussions? I liked his explanation of the partitioning problem. Yet, he and NoSQL advocates seem unaware that numerous companies surmounted much of the problem with good design. We might turn CAP theorem into barely an issue if we can get the industry to put the amount of innovation into non-traditional, strong-consistency architectures as they did into weak-consistency architectures. There is hope: Google went from a famous, NoSQL player to inventing an amazing, strong-consistency RDBMS (F1). Let&#x27;s hope more follow.<p><a href=""https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en/us/pubs/archive/41344.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.c...</a>",1431997158

The cost of all social welfare programs was $529 Billion. The GDP came in at around 17 Trillion.<p>The US could afford it if we really wanted to. So what I&#x27;d like to hear are the counter-arguments.<p>- Is it inflationary? Prima facia, it has to be. But then it would also increase the flow of money and put more people to work in places that the $1,000 gets spent.<p>- Is it fair? If every American receives it, regardless of their wealth, then I don&#x27;t see how it would be unfair.<p>- Is it realistic politically? It seems that the US was pretty close to something along these lines in the 60&#x27;s[0] and Obama finally got universal health care through. Perhaps it is realistic enough to at least put a true, modern pilot program in place and convince ourselves one way or the other. It really seems better than the alternative: Status quo for the homeless and the poor.<p>A real value is that lower financial stress across the entire country would free parents to focus more on raising their kids. Many, many social problems subside when families do better.<p>So my question is, how can we construct a <i>valid</i> experiment to convince ourselves one way or the other that this will benefit society overall, and provide enough value to actually do it?<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.remappingdebate.org/article/guaranteed-income%E2%80%99s-moment-sun"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.remappingdebate.org/article/guaranteed-income%E2%...</a>",1431997048

Sorry that I didn&#x27;t express it clearly enough; I considered the safety issues to be rather obvious.<p>> Rust I understand provides some nice semantics for thread safety but these exist in Java as world.<p>How do you get Java to fail compiling if thread safety constraints are not met? I&#x27;d be interested to try it out!<p>One should definitely care about cache hit rate, because it significantly affects runtime performance. There are just 512 L1D cache lines per CPU core.<p>I/O is the bottleneck? It is becoming less so, one of the few areas where there&#x27;s actually some nice progress happening. PCIe SSDs are up to 1.5 - 2 GB/s (=up to 20 Gbps). More and more servers have 10 Gbps or 40 Gbps networking.<p>Sure, Java is faster when it can use JIT to prune excessive if-jungle, aggressively simplify and inline and adapt to running CPU. But memory layout control is where Java is rather weak. The problem is getting only worse, because the gap between CPU and memory performance is only widening year by year. Memory bandwidth is increasing slowly and latency hasn&#x27;t improved for a decade.<p>C++ is going to be always faster especially if specialized to certain machine and use case. C++ is also going to win by a large margin when there&#x27;s auto-vectorizable code or heavy use of SIMD-intrinsics. 10x is not unusual, if the problem maps well to AVX2 instruction set.",1431996764

Quite a bit.<p>Disk - the technologies used for disk isolation (save chroots) are very poor performance, and in some cases can cause resource contention between what would otherwise appear to be unrelated containers. As an exmaple, using AUFS with Node creates a situation where any containers running on the same file system can only run one at a time, regardless of the number of cores. It&#x27;s silly. Device mapper, on the other hand, is just plain slow (and buggy, when used on Ubuntu 14.4).<p>Network: The extra virtual interfaces, natting, and isolation all come with a performance penalty. For small payloads, this manifests as a few milliseconds of extra latency. For transferring large files, it can result in up to half of your throughput lost. Worse, if you have two docker containers side by side but due to your discovery mechanisms one container uses the host device to talk to the other container, you create what is known as assymetric TCP, which can cut your performance by a fifth or more. Try it out sometime, it&#x27;s entertainingly frustrating to figure out.<p>Security: My favorite. What&#x27;s the point of creating a container for your application if you&#x27;re going to include the entire OS (and typically not even bother to update it with security patches). A real simple DOS on docker boxes would be to get the process to fill the &quot;virtual&quot; disk with cruft. You&#x27;ll impact all running processes, the underlying OS (/var/lib/ is typically on the same device as /), and create such a singularly large file that it&#x27;s usually easier to drop the entire thing and re-pull images instead of trying to trim it down.<p>Sorry if I sound down on the tech, but I&#x27;ve been fighting to make this work for production, and all of these little niggles are driving me batty.",1431995875

I think I&#x27;d rather have good commit messages that explain the &quot;whys&quot; that went into the code.<p>Code typically isn&#x27;t rocket science. It&#x27;s the human knowledge that goes into it that&#x27;s irreplacable.<p>Example 1: OK, you&#x27;re using a third-party CSV parser instead of the one built into the standard library. <i>Why?</i> If your code is crap but well-documented, I can read what you were thinking: <i>&quot;Using non-standard CSV parser because the standard one chokes on files bigger than 2gb&quot;</i> At that point I can refactor your code, or perhaps see that this issue has been fixed in a newer version of the standard library. Or maybe I realize that you confused gigabits and gigabytes and you made a bad choice in the first place, and I realize I can safely remove this dependency. But if your code is tight but undocumented... I would have no idea <i>why</i> this third-party library is being used unless I do some painful trial-and-error that still might not definitively answer the <i>why.</i><p>Example 2: You inherit Mary&#x27;s code. It calculates commissions for our salespeople. The code is sloppy and convoluted, because the sales guys change the commission formulas every month... and these changes have been happening for over ten years, often on very short notice, often contradicting basic assumptions made when the software was originally architected. But Mary documented <i>every</i> change. Which is good, because the fucking sales guys sure don&#x27;t. Her code is literally the company&#x27;s only coherent record in the entire company of the commission process. Remove her comments and commit messages, and none of the code would make sense, even if it was tightened up into a sounder codebase of seven modules with 300 LoC each instead of ten modules with 500 LoC each.<p>So yeah. Totally fictional choice but I&#x27;ll take documentation every time. Code is just code, I can fix it.<p>(Both those examples are fictional, but I&#x27;ve been coding professionally for nearly twenty years and I&#x27;ve seen variations of them countless times...)",1431994164

For instance: Can&#x27;t compete due to OEM agreements with MS? Have to get an OEM to capitulate, or start your own OEM, or find another way to get your competing OS on machines. There is no specific example that will make the argument that competition is impossible go through.<p>Fine - but this argument doesn&#x27;t model reality, and this is where the relevance of evidence comes in: many times competition is theoretically possible but won&#x27;t occur since no one wants to risk a lot of capital and time and effort on what will likely be an unsuccessful venture.<p>So if an unregulated Microsoft manages to lean on their competitors enough that people don&#x27;t want to try competing anymore, then competition is still possible, but without regulation it won&#x27;t occur.",1431994068

The trick is to know when you should use it and when you should not.

Don&#x27;t worry about configuration management, containers, and all that stuff, just learn how to set up the system. So things you&#x27;ll have to do:<p>- Set up a `deployer` user account. (Actually I like to name these after the application they&#x27;re responsible for.)<p>- Install rbenv and your Ruby of choice.<p>- Install nginx or Apache.<p>- Install a Rails app server. I like Unicorn, but if you go with Phusion Passenger there&#x27;s not a separate process 
to manage---it just launches via your web server.<p>- Install your database and give it some initial contents.<p>- Add Capistrano to your Gemfile, write a cap script, get it working.<p>- Since you say this is a web crawler I assume background jobs are important. So if you&#x27;re using Resque or Sidekiq you&#x27;ll need to install Redis.<p>For bonus points:<p>- If you have cron jobs, use `whenever` so they get configured every time you run `cap`.<p>- Install SSL.<p>- Install fail2ban.<p>- Use unicorn instead of passenger.<p>- Use a process manager like god (which is ruby-based) to control unicorn and your background jobs. Btw if you do this, your cap tasks for restarting unicorn, delayed_job, etc. should change to just `sudo god restart myapp-unicorn`, not the direct commands.<p>- Use chef-solo (also ruby-based) so you don&#x27;t have to do it all by hand next time. :-) Tip: to save time, run this against a vagrant VM until you get the bugs out.<p>- Start playing with more bits of the AWS ecosystem, e.g. add an ELB. Run everything in a VPC instead of &quot;EC2 Classic&quot;. Use CloudFormation to launch instances and kick off Chef automatically (using chef-server instead of chef-solo)---or try out OpsWorks, but IMO it&#x27;s a bit beta.

Are we all hopelessly stupid, that we cannot learn to avoid this mistake?<p>Perhaps. But another problem is that argument from authority is almost never ""plain and simple"". There's no bright shining line between an argument from authority and an argument based on an overwhelming accumulation of evidence. At some point it comes down to a judgement call.<p>Suppose a mythical person named Graeme Paul (let's call him ""GP"" for short) arrived here on news.YC and submitted a one-sentence essay: ""Most of the smart programmers that I've met would rather work in Lisp than in Java."" My reaction to this would be straightforward: GP is a troll. A very boring troll.<p>Now let's suppose that GP's post is a bit longer: It begins with his autobiography, in which he talks about his young days as a programmer, and his first encounter with Lisp, and describes the various things he has built in both Lisp and Java. He then gives a detailed, prioritized breakdown of the design of the Java language, comparing Java's features with analogous features in two or three different varieties of Lisp. During this discussion, it becomes clear that GP understands the technical compromises, that he's seen the insides of many real-world Lisp and Java projects, and that he's a gifted explainer. Finally, GP wraps up by summarizing his personal discussions with the designers of Scheme, Java, Ruby, and C.<p>GP is no longer a troll. He's now making a serious and detailed argument, with many facets, that goes on for pages and pages. He may still be wrong -- history is replete with examples of obsessed experts who were wrong -- but he's got a much better argument.<p>Now let's suppose that, instead of typing all that information in one monolithic 193-page post, GP spread it out over several hundred blog posts and news.YC comments, posted over several years. At the end of that time, he comes along with a one-sentence post in some language-war thread: ""Most of the smart programmers that I've met would rather work in Lisp than in Java.""<p>Because this single sentence is a summary of a long-standing, well-established series of arguments from GP, I might (in the right context) mod it up. Then, no doubt, I would be accused of ""not judging this sentence on its merits alone"".<p>The puzzle question here is: Since GP's huge body of published work arguably establishes him as ""an authority"", is my deference to GP an ""argument from authority""? Well, if I've never read any of GP's work but I upmod him anyway because he's famous, the answer is ""yes"". If I've read GP's earlier work and know that it backs up his latest claim, the answer is ""no"". Can you, gentle reader, tell the difference between these two cases? Not unless you know <i>my</i> reputation, and/or ask <i>me</i> to provide up to a dozen pages of rationale and clarification.<p>And there's a huge grey area: If I've read GP's writings on Lisp, and he comes out with a statement about (e.g.) Ruby, how shall I value his expertise when weighing the credibility of his latest statement? It's a judgement call.",1208440721
166307,comment,166012,166012,0,0,yummyfajitas,,,"Subsidies are definitely part of the problem, since they make students less price sensitive.<p>Another part of the problem is that there is no incentive for cost control in the university.<p>I can give a great example of this, from my current university. I'm currently teaching a ""Quantitative Reasoning"" class right now. Basically, take Weeks 1-2 of Prob&Stat and expand it to fill a whole semester (half a semester, due to poor planning and miscommunication). Some of this is my fault, some of it not (2 syllabuses floating around, both of which I was told to ignore). Plus, my students are all art/history/literature majors, and just don't need it. Everyone in the room would be better off keeping their $4,000 and not sitting through my class.<p>So why is this abomination required? Because the department needs money (1) and requiring everyone to take our courses is a way to get money.<p>In principle, someone in the university should put their foot down and say ""this is nonsense, lets just require 1 less class and charge $4,000 less"". But there is no such person in the modern university system.<p>(1) I'm told some of our ""beat the Soviets through mathematics"" grants were finally cancelled. But I'm not sure about this one.",1208440702

166304,story,,,2,0,progg,"Ask YC: PHP or something else?",,"I am an avarage php developer,looking to develop an application (and startup around it) that would have larger number of users. Application would be database driven, so now I am stuck with the choice of either sticking with PHP and using framework like CakePHP that would help me speed up the development, or to try a new platform/language. Example would be Python/Django or Ruby/Rails. I am afraid that by using PHP, scaling issues might appear later on, and would hate if I hate to rewrite whole thing in something else. I know that it all depends on the coder, so I am not sure if it's worth diving into new technology or stick with what I already know.<p>What do you guys recommend?",1208440421

166301,comment,166219,166293,0,0,cellis,,,"This argument doesn't hold weight at all.<p><i>""eBay is almost irreplaceble because it's a marketplace""</i><p>Are you saying marketplaces can't be replaced any easier than social networks (particularly, social networks with suprisingly passionate users)?<p><i>""Any marketplace is difficult to replace because if it already works well is because is reaching a massive audience, even if they are not actively particapating in it. At eBay there already people who have their rating etc so it's hard to beat that.""</i><p>Ok, first off, the formal definition of what you describe is Network Effects - i.e. Metcalfes law. Facebook benefits from that just as well as eBay, and perhaps, as Paul said, even more so, because there is more trust. Secondly, a lot of the ""rating"" is artificially generated, comes from scammy behavior etc, so it doesn't hold much weight.<p><i>""Most people know eBay even if they never bought something off it""</i> ...<p>And most people know about facebook even if they've never used it.<p>I think anyone that underestimates Facebook does so at their own peril.",1208439840

166285,comment,164560,164560,0,0,cmm324,,,"Ugh.. when I worked for a local hospital, the software they used from companies such as Siemens and Medhost was poor.  Poor in that there were to many clicks to get to desired information, poor in that the interfaces were not designed with the user in mind, poor in that they required a difficult update and install process.  One of them would only print properly if a specific version of Adobe Acrobat Reader was installed.  The hospital spent hundreds of thousands...<p>Ultimately the break fix staff spent atleast a quarter of their time troubleshooting issues and patching workstations, not to mention server maintenance.  It seriously was a joke and very dissapointing.<p>I think there is a huge market out there for intuitive web applications for large industries.  I am game for any combination effort.

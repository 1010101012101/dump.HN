Going through school up through high school, I always had the impression that of my fellow classmates, the girls were the best in class. Pre-calculus was the highest math course my dinky high school offered, and there were a couple girls in there with me out of maybe eight students total. It was only when I came to college that I started seeing way more men in my CS and math classes, and lost the impression that guys were just apathetic about school. The only girls in my classes were Indian or Asian, and there weren&#x27;t many of them. One other white girl I knew told me she went into CS because she thought that was the right field for becoming a secretary. I&#x27;ve never had problems with guys harassing me because of my interests or jobs, for which I suppose I&#x27;m fortunate. I wish I knew why there were so few women in my college CS classes, and why I rarely meet other female programmers in my town now.",1382360396
6585144,comment,6584260,6584260,1,0,marcus_holmes,,,"yeah, I do see a future in it. Love coding in it, it solves all the problems I have without the learning cliff usually required.
I think the direction for Go is shown by the fact it doesn&#x27;t have a UI library, but has a really easy route to making web servers: it&#x27;s a language for writing servers in, and html/js is the UI.
The only other language I can see threatening this space is Rust, though obviously the corporate boys will carry on coding in Java and there&#x27;s always going to be a ton of old C/C++ code kicking around that needs maintaining.
But language choice is personal. I&#x27;m really enjoying coding in Go, but I get why others prefer other languages. Diversity is good, we get better results that way :)",1382360389

6585142,comment,6583580,6583580,2,0,keithgabryelski,,,"My observation is that a lot of interviews come down to &quot;stump the chump&quot; questions; a question that is meant to show a single issue the interviewee has under their belt and is used to gauge the entirety of the interviewer&#x27;s ability.  Math puzzles/logic puzzles are in the same category: they require domain knowledge that probably doesn&#x27;t translate to any job I&#x27;ve ever worked on.<p>That aside, one must have a way to measure the abilities of a candidate -- and asking the same set of questions to many people allows you to compare the answers as apples to apples.<p>I generally don&#x27;t restrict my people from asking any particular question, but I will ask them to consider what a failed answer really means for the specific job (questions are generally adjusted then).<p>As an aside, some questions of mine that aren&#x27;t specifically about coding:<p>* do you code outside of work (a love of coding translates to good coders)<p>* send me a link to some code you&#x27;ve written that you are proud of (let see what you got)<p>* tell me about a problem you had where your solution wasn&#x27;t correct (how have you dealt with failure).",1382360383

The apps are written with little focus on battery life. The drivers too. Microsoft doesn&#x27;t write their own drivers and then there&#x27;s firmware too. It&#x27;s the one area where Apple has really taken advantage of the vertical integration - they do everything from firmware to most apps people use.<p>But both Windows and Linux are more than capable to get this all sorted. Like Google showed with the Nexus 7 - focus is all that&#x27;s needed. It&#x27;s just harder for Microsoft considering everything they need to juggle.<p>Edit: Fun fact: Apple&#x27;s own Boot Camp drivers disable USB selective suspend on the 2013 Air!

That is obvious, she was the first programmer, by definition she did before anyone else (male or female).<p>Or saying that Brazil has lots of female programmers and people assume that women in suits are in IT... That one is beyond wrong.<p>If you see a woman in suit (common where I live, that is So Paulo), their most likely job (beside being a secretary) is being a lawyer (we have a obscene amount of lawyers anyway).<p>Every day I cross by lots of female lawyers, had lawyer GFs, have lots of lawyer female friends...<p>Now the average woman dislike IT, not because it is a thing of men, when I am talking about IT wit ha friend for example and a women is bothered by it (happened a couple times), or impressed by it (also happened a couple times), what they say to me is that IT deals with machines and that is too complicated. (when I was younger I tried to teach them and whatnot, and I became sad when they just said it was complicated and refused to learn, now I see is that they don&#x27;t want to bother).<p>I DID met some women working at IT, including had female co-workers... One interesting thing on them was that most were doing it for the money, because IT is well paid, women that suck at lawyering or other humananities end joining IT instead. I&#x27;ve met one women in IT that was in IT because she truly wanted to, her husband was a engineer, and she decided to have the same career as him, and work in IT as a hobby (she was very clear to our boss, that if work got in the way of taking care of her children she would quit because her husband money was enough... this was when the boss started to demand excessive overtime after badly created schedules)<p>Also by the way, when someone DO act sexist, is usually, women against women.<p>I have a degree in Game Design, on my campus there was also a course in Fashion Business (and several other design courses, and architecture).<p>My class had zero females.
The other class in my year had one, that quickly became infamous (because she openly exchanged sex for people doing homework for her, specially with dumb guys, then she PROMISED sex, had the guy do the homework, and then dumped him)<p>Yet, several women became friends with us, and thought of moving to our course (some actually did), and people that joined after my year also had a bunch of women (I think the record was 25%)<p>Those women (that were officially in our course, or were friends and hanged out with us) were frequently attacked by women in other courses.<p>Most common attacks:
&quot;You are fat and ugly and want to hang out with nerds and otakus to have sex&quot; (this was the most common, easily)
&quot;You are ugly and this is why you cannot work with fashion&quot; (this came from fashion business students)
&quot;You are not a woman, you want to be a boy&quot;
&quot;You are poor, not good enough for us&quot; (Fashion Design students usually drove to university with Audi, Mercedes, etc... that in Brazil are crazy expensive, reaching in the six figures easily, Game Design students usually went walking or using bus, and most struggled to pay the tuition, sometimes you would recognize a fashion student on the bus stop, and frequently their reaction was to get instantly deep red and hide behind other people...)<p>After university, I kept seeing this same sort of behavior. (ie: other women attack IT women for not being lawyer, or medic, or PR...) although not as much as they attack full-time mothers (or those that state they want to drop their careers to become full-time mothers).",1382360139

6585086,comment,6584628,6585007,2,0,kapowaz,,,"> No, the primary reason is that IDs prevent reuse.<p>Reuse of what, exactly? Selectors? Properties? My assertion is that if you need to re-use properties a lot then you should make use of a preprocessor framework and then use a combination of mixins or extends. Re-use of selectors is an unnecessary artefact of how OOCSS (and similar) suggest you should write your code.<p>> If you want to build a library of reusable components, IDs are obviously not what you want.<p>If you&#x27;re building components that could end up on any page entirely outside of your control, I agree. But: horses for courses. It still has valid uses, and avoiding it entirely isn&#x27;t necessary.<p>> Secondly, if you use IDs which were added for JavaScript or fragment links, you&#x27;ll introduce some coupling which really shouldn&#x27;t be there.<p>You&#x27;re looking at this backwards: IDs exist for many purposes, not just CSS. Selecting elements by ID in JavaScript, or using a fragment identifier to link to within a page are just two other examples of how they can be used, and not considering the other purposes of the attribute is part of the problem (see also CSS classes).<p>> Same thing with JavaScript. If you need a class, you should add a prefixed one (e.g. &quot;js-foo&quot;).<p>How does the developer benefit from writing the classname like this? Why is a prefixed classname any more informative to you than a selector that tells you a little about the context in which the element appears? I&#x27;ve actually come around to the view that if you&#x27;re using this class to select on any other criterion than the semantic purpose of the element is wrong, and it would be more appropriate to use a data attribute to contain the hooks for additional behaviour.",1382359709

All cryptographic keys used in the operation of the service have been zerofilled, and while no logs were produced (by design) during operation of the service, all records created incidental to the operation of the service have been deleted to the best of our ability.<p>Essentially, the service was created and operated under a certain understanding of current US law, and that understanding may not currently be valid.  As we are a US company and comply fully with US law, but wish to protect the privacy of our users, it is impossible for us to continue offering the CryptoSeal Privacy consumer VPN product.<p>Specifically, the Lavabit case, with filings released by Kevin Poulsen of Wired.com (<a href=""https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/801182-redacted-pleadings-exhibits-1-23.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/801182-redacted-plea...</a>) reveals a Government theory that if a pen register order is made on a provider, and the provider&#x27;s systems do not readily facilitate full monitoring of pen register information and delivery to the Government in realtime, the Government can compel production of cryptographic keys via a warrant to support a government-provided pen trap device.  Our system does not support recording any of the information commonly requested in a pen register order, and it would be technically infeasible for us to add this in a prompt manner.  The consequence, being forced to turn over cryptographic keys to our entire system on the strength of a pen register order, is unreasonable in our opinion, and likely unconstitutional, but until this matter is settled, we are unable to proceed with our service.<p>We encourage anyone interested in this issue to support Ladar Levison and Lavabit in their ongoing legal battle.  Donations can be made at <a href=""https://rally.org/lavabit"" rel=""nofollow"">https://rally.org/lavabit</a>  We believe Lavabit is an excellent test case for this issue.<p>We are actively investigating alternative technical ways to provide a consumer privacy VPN service in the future, in compliance with the law (even the Government&#x27;s current interpretation of pen register orders and compelled key disclosure) without compromising user privacy, but do not have an estimated release date at this time.<p>To our affected users: we are sincerely sorry for any inconvenience.  For any users with positive account balances at the time of this action, we will provide 1 year subscriptions to a non-US VPN service of mutual selection, as well as a refund of your service balance, and free service for 1 year if/when we relaunch a
consumer privacy VPN service.  Thank you for your support, and we hope this will ease the inconvenience of our service terminating.<p>For anyone operating a VPN, mail, or other communications provider in the US, we believe it would be prudent to evaluate whether a pen register order could be used to compel you to divulge SSL keys protecting message contents, and if so, to take appropriate action.&quot;",1382359617

Suspects will get CAPTCHA. (~0.01% false positives)<p>Visitor Reputation - we use crowd-sourcing to compile a list of suspected IPs. The list is updated in real time. Combined with other signals, this data allows us a better understanding of the incoming traffic.<p>Progressive Challenges - We check visitor&#x27;s ability to retain cookies, execute JS and so on. In this case, the browser-based bots were able to evade those defenses.

Among most of the stuff that got mentioned, the single biggest thing I couldn&#x27;t accept was the rigid structure of the course work. I was teaching computers to elementary kids and throughout the entire year of lessons there was nothing about what actually makes a computer work. When I approached the supervisor about this I was told &quot;As long as it fits the curriculum&quot;.

Instead, kids were spending 4-5 weeks typing for 40 minutes as their lesson.<p>This, in the end, was what did me in with teaching (aside from the bureaucratic and nepotistic BS). That in 2006 the biggest factors in exposing kids to computers was by having them play Dr. Seuss games and typing all day.

But I want to challenge the widely-held view that a long CSS file is necessarily bad. First of all, what does 4,000 lines mean in terms of actual document weight? And what is the weight of the gzipped file actually served? Repetition in selectors might look bad on the surface, but this is exactly the kind of thing that compresses well. Once actually served this file then ought to be cached well, and so the issue of document weight is potentially moot.<p>Obviously there are extremes beyond which it may no longer be sensible to serve something like this, but arguably at that point you ought to be noticing issues in your un-preprocessed source anyway.",1382358153

6584957,comment,6583580,6583580,75,0,tokenadult,,,"There are many discussions here on HN about company hiring procedures. Company hiring procedures and their effectiveness is a heavily researched topic, but most hiring managers and most job applicants haven&#x27;t looked up much of the research. After reading the blog post kindly submitted here and some of its comments, and then reading most of the comments here on HN that came in while I was asleep in my time zone, it looks like it&#x27;s time to recycle some electrons from a FAQ I&#x27;m building about company hiring procedures.<p>The review article by Frank L. Schmidt and John E. Hunter, &quot;The Validity and Utility of Selection Models in Personnel Psychology: Practical and Theoretical Implications of 85 Years of Research Findings,&quot;[1]  Psychological Bulletin, Vol. 124, No. 2, 262-274 sums up, current to 1998, a meta-analysis of much of the <i>huge</i> peer-reviewed professional literature on the industrial and organizational psychology devoted to business hiring procedures. There are many kinds of hiring criteria, such as in-person interviews, telephone interviews, resume reviews for job experience, checks for academic credentials, personality tests, and so on. There is much published study research on how job applicants perform after they are hired in a wide variety of occupations.[2]<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: If you are hiring for any kind of job in the United States, with its legal rules about hiring, prefer a work-sample test as your hiring procedure. If you are hiring in most other parts of the world, use a work-sample test in combination with a general mental ability test.<p>The overall summary of the industrial psychology research in reliable secondary sources is that two kinds of job screening procedures work reasonably well. One is a general mental ability (GMA) test (an IQ-like test, such as the Wonderlic personnel screening test). Another is a work-sample test, where the applicant does an actual task or group of tasks like what the applicant will do on the job if hired. (But the calculated validity of each of the two best kinds of procedures, standing alone, is only 0.54 for work sample tests and 0.51 for general mental ability tests.) Each of these kinds of tests has about the same validity in screening applicants for jobs, with the general mental ability test better predicting success for applicants who will be trained into a new job. Neither is perfect (both miss some good performers on the job, and select some bad performers on the job), but both are better than any other single-factor hiring procedure that has been tested in rigorous research, across a wide variety of occupations. So if you are hiring for your company, it&#x27;s a good idea to think about how to build a work-sample test into all of your hiring processes.<p>Because of a Supreme Court decision in the United States (the decision does not apply in other countries, which have different statutes about employment), it is legally risky to give job applicants general mental ability tests such as a straight-up IQ test (as was commonplace in my parents&#x27; generation) as a routine part of hiring procedures. The Griggs v. Duke Power, 401 U.S. 424 (1971) case[3] interpreted a federal statute about employment discrimination and held that a general intelligence test used in hiring that could have a &quot;disparate impact&quot; on applicants of some protected classes must &quot;bear a demonstrable relationship to successful performance of the jobs for which it was used.&quot; In other words, a company that wants to use a test like the Wonderlic, or like the SAT, or like the current WAIS or Stanford-Binet IQ tests, in a hiring procedure had best conduct a specific validation study of the test related to performance on the job in question. Some companies do the validation study, and use IQ-like tests in hiring. Other companies use IQ-like tests in hiring and hope that no one sues (which is not what I would advise any company). Note that a brain-teaser-type test used in a hiring procedure could be challenged as illegal if it can be shown to have disparate impact on some job applicants. A company defending a brain-teaser test for hiring would have to defend it by showing it is supported by a validation study demonstrating that the test is related to successful performance on the job. Such validation studies can be quite expensive. (Companies outside the United States are regulated by different laws. One other big difference between the United States and other countries is the relative ease with which workers may be fired in the United States, allowing companies to correct hiring mistakes by terminating the employment of the workers they hired mistakenly. The more legal protections a worker has from being fired, the more reluctant companies will be about hiring in the first place.)<p>The social background to the legal environment in the United States is explained in various books about hiring procedures,[4] and some of the social background appears to be changing in the most recent few decades, with the prospect for further changes.[5]<p>Previous discussion on HN pointed out that the Schmidt & Hunter (1998) article showed that multi-factor procedures work better than single-factor procedures, a summary of that article we can find in the current professional literature, for example &quot;Reasons for being selective when choosing personnel selection procedures&quot;[6] (2010) by Cornelius J. Knig, Ute-Christine Klehe, Matthias Berchtold, and Martin Kleinmann:<p>&quot;Choosing personnel selection procedures could be so simple: Grab your copy of Schmidt and Hunter (1998) and read their Table 1 (again). This should remind you to use a general mental ability (GMA) test in combination with an integrity test, a structured interview, a work sample test, and/or a conscientiousness measure.&quot;<p>But the 2010 article notes, looking at actual practice of companies around the world, &quot;However, this idea does not seem to capture what is actually happening in organizations, as practitioners worldwide often use procedures with low predictive validity and regularly ignore procedures that are more valid (e.g., Di Milia, 2004; Lievens & De Paepe, 2004; Ryan, McFarland, Baron, & Page, 1999; Scholarios & Lockyer, 1999; Schuler, Hell, Trapmann, Schaar, & Boramir, 2007; Taylor, Keelty, & McDonnell, 2002). For example, the highly valid work sample tests are hardly used in the US, and the potentially rather useless procedure of graphology (Dean, 1992; Neter & Ben-Shakhar, 1989) is applied somewhere between occasionally and often in France (Ryan et al., 1999). In Germany, the use of GMA tests is reported to be low and to be decreasing (i.e., only 30% of the companies surveyed by Schuler et al., 2007, now use them).&quot;<p>[1]<p><a href=""http://mavweb.mnsu.edu/howard/Schmidt%20and%20Hunter%201998%20Validity%20and%20Utility%20Psychological%20Bulletin.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mavweb.mnsu.edu/howard/Schmidt%20and%20Hunter%201998%...</a><p>[2]<p><a href=""http://www.siop.org/workplace/employment%20testing/testtypes.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.siop.org/workplace/employment%20testing/testtypes...</a><p>[3]<p><a href=""http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8655598674229196978&q=Griggs+Duke+Power&hl=en&as_sdt=2,24"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8655598674229196...</a><p>[4]<p><a href=""http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=SRv-GZkw6TEC"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=SRv-GZkw6TEC</a><p>[5]<p><a href=""http://intl-pss.sagepub.com/content/17/10/913.full"" rel=""nofollow"">http://intl-pss.sagepub.com/content/17/10/913.full</a><p><a href=""http://www.economics.harvard.edu/faculty/fryer/files/Fryer_Racial_Inequality.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.economics.harvard.edu/faculty/fryer/files/Fryer_R...</a><p>[6]<p><a href=""http://geb.uni-giessen.de/geb/volltexte/2012/8532/pdf/preprint_j.1468_2389.2010.00485.x.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://geb.uni-giessen.de/geb/volltexte/2012/8532/pdf/prepri...</a>",1382357868

6584878,comment,6581987,6584248,1,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"> Sure, there are some, but I believe predictions and discussion regarding those effects to frequently be greatly exaggerated or completely unrealistic.<p>You&#x27;re basically questioning the efficient market hypothesis. If a corporation or investor can save $50M in taxes by spending $45M rearranging their affairs, they&#x27;re making a $5M profit to do it. Which they tend to not want to leave on the table.<p>> Shareholders might say, &quot;Don&#x27;t give me an increase on paper. Give me a payment on my current holding, while I maintain that holding&quot;.<p>Again, you&#x27;re claiming that shareholders will want to act irrationally. There is mathematically no non-tax difference between issuing a dividend and using the same money to have a share buy-back combined with a stock split, except that the latter allows shareholders to choose whether they want more stock value or cash right now, which when you consider the tax implications really means choosing whether to pay any taxes right now.<p>> This is especially so if, as you say, shareholders are more reluctant to sell shares and trigger a larger personal tax event.<p>That doesn&#x27;t make any sense. If a shareholder wants cash then they can sell that portion of their shares and the tax event would be <i>smaller</i> than receiving a dividend in the same amount if capital gains and dividends are taxed at the same rate, because the capital gain would have the price originally paid for the shares deducted from the taxable income rather than taxing the full amount.<p>> The short is that each company is still competing for shareholders. Accruing cash well-beyond what the company can deploy to grow revenue is not in the interest of the company or its shareholders.<p>Then explain the multi-billion dollar cash hoards held by most large successful corporations.<p>> Companies aren&#x27;t just going to start doing things that are bad for them (e.g. making bad investments), simply to avoid taxation.<p>They don&#x27;t make <i>intentionally</i> bad investments. But they can make bad or less good investments than the real parties in interest (the actual owners of the capital) would do if the money was under their direct control -- just not so much worse that it&#x27;s worth losing half the money to the tax man.<p>> This is profit that is being distributed to shareholders, just as now. No one is coming to take the investors&#x27; previous wealth (as is often implied). These taxes are simply deducted from what is otherwise a &quot;windfall&quot;.<p>I&#x27;m not sure why that should make the investors want to pay it any more.<p>> If I have a million dollar gain on a thousand dollar investment, then sure I&#x27;m going to cash out at some point.<p>Not necessarily. You might just hold onto it until your kids inherit it, which is what so many of the people you most want to tax because they have so much money are doing.<p>> This, of course, is already happening on a regular basis.<p>But not as much as it would if there weren&#x27;t as many taxes on it.<p>> And, what else I&#x27;m going to do with it? Hold it on paper forever where it has zero value?<p>It has not zero value. You can take a loan against it and then deduct the interest on the loan from your taxes. Holding ownership of a company&#x27;s stock may allow you to control the company and e.g. give cushy jobs to yourself or your buddies, or build cool stuff and change the world, etc. These are not zero value things.",1382356895

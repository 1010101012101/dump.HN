2952476,comment,2940974,2948221,1,0,to3m,,,"""If you do want their work they'll have to redo it in turn, based on the latest set of changes."" - and this is exactly the problem that locking is trying to help solve. I don't see how you can state that contention isn't a failure, if people are then to have to redo work! These are real people, presumably working to some kind of deadline. They have better things to do (and their paymasters have better things to spend their money on) than spend time redoing changes that they've already done. (It sort of sounds like you don't think non-programmers would ever have the need to edit a file at the same time as anybody else might be editing it! Sadly that is not the case...)<p>As for using an external tool or process to manage the locking, perhaps one has to actually experience this approach in person to appreciate its limitations? Or maybe what's in my mind's eye is different from what's in yours? Anyway, I would not recommend doing this myself.",1314925167

Get that content online, now, in a convenient form that is cost competitive with Netflix and Hulu or at least Amazon Video on Demand.</i><p>I think this is the way you're going to see most of these networks going. Particularly subscription supported services like Starz/HBO/Showtime.  These services are actually already the least tied to the traditional cable model since they're pure subscription without ad revenues. They, frankly, would likely really prefer to stream you content via IP and not have to pay a distributor (cable operator or Netflix) their cut.   They have to go about it slowly and carefully however. Right now while us internet masses may be clamoring for streamed content they aren't going to risk their primary revenue methods (cable) until they can rely on their secondary revenue streams.<p>HBO-Go is the start of this, right now its very closely tied to the cable operators.

2952335,comment,2952101,2952101,12,0,zach,,,"This is the right move for Starz.  They should focus on moving onto the iPad and the app/channel stores for Apple TV and the next-gen Google TV.<p>Re-upping would only antagonize their existing content partners who they also have to renegotiate contracts with. Plus it is probably killing their subscriptions on traditional outlets (""Starz? Oh, no thanks, that's the one I get on Netflix"").  At least this way they can turn off the spigot and entice people to subscribe before Netflix is primarily cord-cutters anyway.<p>As for the way forward, licensing to Netflix is not exactly a forward-looking move -- Starz just a licensing middleman in this arrangement and they know it.  They need to control a branded and coherent channel, not be a movie broker.<p>Starz was valuable because of their mainstream movie content.  Despite comments about bittorrent, the major value of Starz on Netflix is about 8-year-old girls being able to watch Tangled on an Xbox 360 (again and again...).  It has been huge for rounding out Netflix's pitch as an alternative to rental.<p>But to hear Reed talk about it, he probably was negotiating with the expectation that they'd be parting ways (how could they fix the Sony thing?) and so Netflix may not have been offering as much as last time anyway.  I don't think the negotiations failing caught either side flat-footed.<p>I think these companies can focus better on their revenue when they're separated.  Netflix will have to overpay to get their first big chunk of studio newish-releases, but that's okay.  They'll have some different stuff and get creative and I bet we'll like the result.<p>Starz can figure out how to sell themselves to consumers without chopping themselves up.  How?  Well, every current Apple TV has 8GB of flash memory and Apple has put an App Store on every other platform they own, so you can see where that's going.  And Google has gone double-or-nothing on Google TV for that reason.  It sure seems like the Apple TV is the cable box of the future.  Is Starz well-positioned to become a subscription service on the Apple TV?  Sure.  But maybe not if people can go next door to the Netflix app and get Starz movies there too.<p>Seems like the right thing is happening here.  I like where this is going.",1314922064

Heh.<p>Fact is, $8/month for Netflix is all I can justify and I justify that largely based on TV reruns than movies. Add in Hulu (not Plus) and that's my limit.<p>Given all that if I could just get HBO Go without subscribing to cable, I'd gladly fork over maybe even $20/month.

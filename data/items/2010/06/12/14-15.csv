Thin took that ragel parser and added eventmachine to the mix which made it much faster the mongrel. Unicorn went a step further by leveraging the kernel in such a way that things got even faster. Macournoyer, creator of thin was working on thin-turbo, a rewrite of the thin backend in C but stopped a while back.

You can apply to Stanford and MIT with perfect grades and a perfect SAT score, and they'll still reject you! There are more people with perfect SAT scores than there are admission spots. To trim down the pool, the college has to look outside of schoolwork. That's where the extracurriculars come into play. In most cases, whether you have something to write on that list is determined by how hard-working you are, not by how smart you are. And once they see that you spent your time doing something great outside of school, the admissions people will forgive your less-than-stellar grades. An added benefit to the school that comes from choosing hard-working people over bookworms is that once the students graduate, the hard working people will go on to build great businesses and ... wait for it ... donate to the school!<p>Spend a few minutes putting yourself in the admission officer's spot and think about how you'd choose the next round of students.<p>Personally, I recommend focusing on your perseverance first, social smarts second, and book smarts third.<p>PS: I guarantee you that girl on the news getting fished out of the Indian Ocean right now will be attending Stanford when she turns 18.",1276354372

My second issue is that most job postings are by recruiters on tech boards. That means all these ""great"" sounding listings have no company name to go with it and you have to then deal with a recruiter who doesn't care where you work as long as he places you quickly and takes their cut.

The main thing that will help is SHREK:<p><i>Say who you are</i>: ""Hi I'm [name] calling from [company], we're a web agency nearby that specialize in X.""<p><i>Note you may have to repeat this step more than once as you will most likely get through to a secretary. If this is a totally cold call (you've not spoken to the person before, you don't know their name) you should make it sound confident and like there shouldn't be any reason not to put you through to how it is you need to speak to. If you don't know who you need to speak to, ask for a generic title, don't be afraid of asking too high (e.g. ""can I speak to your CTO?"")</i><p><i>Hook</i>: ""I've just been looking at your site / I spoke with someone last week / We met at a trade fair / I know X, who apparently is an ex-colleague of yours / We've just done a website for [a key competitor of theirs] and wondered if we could do something for you.""<p><i>Reason statement</i>: Why should they be interested? ""We have a new web design service we've aimed specifically at X""<p><i>Key questions</i>: If they sound interested, figure out how important this could be to them. ""How do you update your website currently? / How much is X costing you? Have you considered integrating your website with X?""<p>The above would be easier if you have a specific product, but if - like us - you're a service-based agency, you'll have to play it by ear a bit, or maybe create specific products for industry niches. I'm not a natural salesperson at all, but one of the first things we did when we started our company was to invest in a training day from an extremely good salesperson in our network. It's paid for itself many times over.<p>One of the hardest things is to keep motivation when you have a list of phone numbers in front of you. This is a game of numbers, sooner or later you'll call someone who is currently after exactly what you're selling. In order to do maintain enthusiasm, 'visualise success', such as what the potential new business would do for your company, for you personally and professionally.<p>Obviously there is a lot more to this.

1426017,comment,1425872,1425959,0,0,elblanco,,,"No, but it does have its uses. I've found it particularly helpful when communicating complicated technical decisions to non-technical management. They ""feel"" like it's a true technical document (even if it only superficially conveys what's actually happening) and it empowers them to make better decisions.<p>Amongst actual technical staff? I don't think I've ever even seen a UML diagram on display in my entire career outside of perhaps the occasional E-R Schema model.<p>Honestly, that gap is one that really <i>does</i> need to be addressed since technical staff pretty much work on whatever they want to work on, master design documents be damned. Perhaps some of it is that extant architecture methodologies are all top-down, where information concerning design and intent flow down, but there's no formal feedback loop, a bottom-up component, in-place for implementers to say ""well, that doesn't make sense, we're going to do it this way, change the design docs to reflect"". I think it's this lack of a formal approach from both directions that really cause a lot of large systems engineering and integration projects to end up with poor results.<p>Many ""technical"" UML users I've come in contact with tend to be a decade or more removed from the actual technology they are designing around...familiar only with feature and capability lists of the technology ecosystem they are working in. In management meetings they'll continue to pull out year old UML diagrams built in a vacuum to make a point, when all they have to do is talk to the most junior developer to see that the de facto picture is wildly different than in the docs.<p>In the end, all that really matters is that the system does what it's supposed to do, it doesn't matter as much <i>how</i> it actually does it. UML makes non-implementers think they are having some say in how things are to be built when it's very rarely the case.<p>Another interesting thing I've noticed is that as time has progressed, in order to become more useful, the UML spec has started to vacuum up other traditional diagramming techniques beyond just use cases event models. This is definitely an effort to make UML ""work"" for technical folks and not just decision makers. Unifying/Rationalizing higher level models with lower-level technical models is actually pretty hard and demonstrates a large number of problems with both sets of models pretty quickly, faster than cranking out half-baked code.<p>I will say though that I've started to see better models for communicating architecture to management recently. Archimate springs to mind: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ArchiMate"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ArchiMate</a><p>It leaves out lots of details that are irrelevant/dangerous for decision makers to see, while focusing them on the entire enterprise stack.

Their human-visible text is obviously too bulky to store a reasonable database of 500GB or 1TB, but no reason it couldn't support a more compact encoding.<p>(Alternately, you could use optical storage and hope redundancy and ECC will be enough. For example, if you want to store 500GB, you could take 20 Bluray 50GB drives, split it all into 25GB chunks, and then generate 25GB of ECC data, such as <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parchive"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parchive</a> files.

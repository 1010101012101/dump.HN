7693762,comment,7692620,7692620,1,0,jamesbrownuhh,,,"This article seems quite naive. Painting P2P traffic as something &quot;which Comcast cannot block&quot;  ignores both history and the reason why Netflix paid for direct peering with Comcast in the first place. It&#x27;s not that their traffic was being &quot;blocked&quot;, just that it was coming in on the same overloaded pipes as other general Internet traffic. While Comcast customers might not notice a web page taking a few milliseconds longer to load, they certainly notice the difference in video streaming quality, and hence why the new peering arrangement made a difference.<p>Shifting all the traffic to P2P most likely would send Netflix traffic back into the overloaded slow lanes again - and if anything makes it all the MORE likely to be further slowed down and deprioritised for reasons. Phrases like &quot;Internet traffic of a type often used for piracy&quot; are all that needs to be said to justify whatever further shaping, blocking, and other indignities could be applied to it.",1399195003

RSA key transport also transports a(n ephemeral) session key that is used for symmetric encryption and authentication of the payload and that can be used to compromise the connection if it can be predicted.<p>3. In a way, encrypting the session data is also done by generating an ephemeral &quot;key&quot; for each byte/block using the symmetric cipher as a CSPRNG (moreso with stream ciphers/modes than with &quot;real&quot; block modes), but you most certainly would not want to use that as an argument for using ECB in TLS.<p>4.

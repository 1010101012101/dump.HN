What type of marketing/market research have you done for your target demographic?  Do you have an advertising campaign set up to reach your target?  <p>You have to realize that the kind of people that would like to share restaurant experiences are probably not the same type of people who enjoy discovering the latest web 2.0 website just because it has been launched two weeks ago.",1179467337

Then try to do a second release within a week with a few little extra features that have been requested to show the community you listen to them.<p>Nice site, keep up the good work.",1179466337

Is it so hard to accept that ppl dont' give a rat's a$$ about ""blogging"" about stuffing themseves with food?<p>People like to talk about THEMSELVES. This is what drives social network sites.

However, could they possibly reduce the amount of waste generated?  Where is the rest of it going?<p>Center City also has a crew of workers to operate noisy, walk-behind, teal street sweepers.  I'm not sure if these actually pick up garbage, but at any rate it would be a delight to see them pull a tour of duty on Snyder Ave. instead of Market.",1364266793

5441125,comment,5441086,5441086,10,0,_delirium,,,"My hunch is that this says more about Yahoo than anything else, but without technical details it's hard to be sure. There's been good summarization tech that Yahoo hasn't implemented for at least a decade, despite having dozens of engineers who could be doing so. Did this startup they bought for $30m implement something another class above that yet? Or are they buying themselves up to the par they should've already been at?",1364266718
5441124,comment,5438797,5440849,4,0,archon,,,"> either position strikes me as irrational.<p>Right. Because they are both irrational. Fear isn't a rational thing. I think both tehwalrus's comment and mine are two very different responses to the same fear.<p>tehwalrus fears being surrounded by people who are ""armed to the teeth, legally."" I fear being surrounded by people who are armed to the teeth, illegally. tehwalrus would rather those people not be armed at all. I would rather have the ability to at least attempt to defend myself with comparable force.<p>Where we differ is in our assumptions. I assume that no law will ever make firearms magically inaccessible to criminals.<p>> The chances of being the victim of random violent in either country is not worth worrying about.<p>Yep. I realize, in the rational parts of my mind, that if I sold my guns tomorrow and never touched one again, I have a pretty high probability of living to a ripe old age without ever being a victim of violence. I don't want to put words in tehwalrus' mouth, but I think he probably realizes too that if he were to live in the States, the chance of one of those gun-carriers around him on a day to day basis going on a shooting spree is quite small.<p>But my point is that fear is immune to statistics. In my mind, owning guns for self-defense (and, on a side note, knowing when and how to use them legally) is the exact same thing as buying life insurance. Statistically, will I ever need life insurance? No. Otherwise insurance companies wouldn't make a profit. But there's always the chance. So in the same way that I want my family to be provided for in the event that I die unexpectedly, I want the ability to attempt to defend myself and the people I care about.<p>Would I prefer to live in a perfect world where nobody's afraid of violence? Absolutely. But unfortunately we don't live in such a place.",1364266706

For as much as I love HN, I think it does not stand to the standards of what it is: a meeting place for hackers.<p>When we work on the web, we focus on being semantic, conscious about the actual web in which one size does not fit all, usability and design. None of which HN has: tables, it doesn't work on mobile (and the links on the submission aren't clickable) and you can't undo your vote. I understand another hacker value is protoyping and MVP-thinking, but when you have a vibrant community a few years old, that's not the case.<p>Maybe the hacker thinking on HN is doing it yourself, maybe you can come up with a browser extension that fixes this stuff.<p>In the meanwhile, you can use ihackernews.com for when you're on the go.",1364263532

Yes, I have given my credit card number to its Play Store, but I have given that to like 15 other services on the internet who just charge me when appropriate. They have my personal emails, its machines read them and show me ads, which I block with adblock plus anyway. It is training its natural language processing algorithms by reading my emails, and not giving me a share of them. I'm fine with that. It's giving me a really unmatched email service for that cost, and I understand that. It is acting according to its privacy policy, which it is trying to unify across its products. I believe so far, except one or two occasions they have been pretty fair to it.",1364263257

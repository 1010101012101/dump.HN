Yet I'm about to enter my senior year to graduate with a Political Science degree, only having a minor in Art and in CS.<p>If you're like me (it sounds like you may be), you're smart. Just wait until you figure out that there are other ways to gratify your intellect than coding. Take a class that has nothing to do with any sciences. One that you want to, not one that you're forced to. You just may enjoy it :)<p>Personal experience: I was very far ahead of what I needed to do in order to graduate very early on (credits that came in from HS combined with taking 17-18 credits a semester, every semester). As a result, I would either wind up graduating a year early, or I could take random classes in whatever I thought would be interesting (without falling behind!). I chose the latter. Due to that, I'm in what I think is a pretty unique situation; I can graduate in the next year with an undergrad degree in three completely unrelated fields, if I wanted to.",1279478849

1526419,comment,1525770,1526257,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Yes.<p>There's a problem of scale with any centralized authority. While it's relatively easy to have total control over a population of a few thousand, span-of-control problems mean that multiple levels of managers must be involved the larger the populace.<p>Note that I am not saying that folks are more <i>oppressed</i> now than at any other time in history (aside from obvious examples). I am saying that the ability for a central authority to monitor and control each person's behavior has scaled enormously.<p>Every large enough organization experiences a tremendous degree of infidelity between the authority's wishes and how those wishes are actually carried out. Most folks look at some huge thing like, say North Korea, and think that there is one person completely in charge, and on paper it looks like that. But reality doesn't work like that at all. Instead central authorities in large systems constantly have to use persuasion, politics, and marketing tactics to get their wishes fulfilled. This was true with ancient Rome and much as today.<p>So there is a constant give-and-take between the ideals and plans of leaders and the zeitgeist of the ruled. This, along with regularly-changing leadership, allows organizations to learn and adapt. Effective organizations embrace this tension and provide a means for regularly changing course, sometimes in a dramatic way.<p>But what if leaders didn't have to worry about all those middle-level guys and discontent? What if you could have one central person/group that could monitor each person's actions minute-to-minute, applying various forms of non-lethal pain every time the person steps out of line? Don't like the food prices and want to go downtown to yell at the leaders? Well maybe we'll let you feel like you are on-fire for a few minutes and see how likely you are to try that again. Caesar doesn't have to worry about the Senate or governors in the provinces or the mob any more -- with computers and non-lethal population control, he can effectively manage hundreds of millions as easily as he could some bloke sitting in front of him in the same room.<p>The state-of-monitoring discussion is for another thread. The key point here is that monitoring and control becomes a lot more palatable if nobody is getting hurt, so by inventing lots of forms of non-lethally controlling folks, leaders can squeeze tighter and tighter. Never before in history has it been that way. When the United States passed prohibition, everybody nodded their heads and drank anyway. Over time, it was painfully obvious what a disaster prohibition was. It's not that way today. Back then, to enforce prohibition you had to have tens of thousands of cops and FBI agents who were true believers and willing to harm and kill people to enforce the law. Those people simply didn't exist. The people who passed prohibition had morals, righteous feelings, and a majority vote on their side, but they wanted the impossible from the population.<p>Today we're cutting way back on the systemic checks -- it only takes one true-believer in prohibition somewhere in the government to do some data mining of cell phone locations over time to easily find out where all the gin joints are. It only takes one or two guys to deploy some non-lethal force on those establishments to make them off-limits -- all without the nasty political fall-out of people harmed or killed -- or the practical requirement of actually having a big enough percentage of the population that supports enforcement (instead of just enactment)<p>We live in an incredible time in history. We're seeing this massive system of state control develop on a scale that would boggle the minds of folks just fifty years ago. I'm hoping for a century or two of Pax Romana before we end up with a Caligula -- but I wouldn't bet on it.",1279478813

1526410,comment,1526104,1526217,0,0,gruseom,,,"I agree with the thrust of your comment that vernacular is what it is and attempts to police it are foolish. Though there's no need to be rude. And ""he"" is not <i>a</i> vernacular (Muphry's Law?). But this case is a lot more subtle than you imply.<p>Generic singular ""he"" is an older usage that is slowly phasing out as society changes. When I find myself using ""he"" for this, I always notice that it doesn't quite feel right anymore. Of course most people who favor this usage point to its ""standard"" correctness (cf. this thread), but that's pointing to the past. What's interesting is that we're in a pluralistic stage where there are many competing alternatives -- generic ""he"", alternating ""he"" and ""she"", ""he or she"", singular ""they"" -- <i>none</i> of which quite feels right.<p>This is untenable in the long run because it forces you to think about which one to use. That's way too much runtime overhead, and it's not how language works. Vernacular is a don't-make-me-think thing. That's the real problem with sprout's suggestion in the GP, i.e. rewording to drop the generic singular altogether. It's a viable alternative, and I do it all the time, but it's also the most expensive.<p>There's no way this gap won't get filled. The only reason we haven't seen it yet is that fundamental language shifts are slow relative to a human lifespan.<p>The option I find most annoying is the ""sometimes use 'he' and sometimes use 'she'"" one, which is like solving a design problem in a function by offloading it entirely to the caller. Not only do you have to think about which one to use, you also have to reference-count to keep the two in balance over time. No way is that one going to survive. (I also find that people who do this tend to be annoying tsk-tsk types, though maybe that's a prejudice.) My money's on singular ""they"", because it's the simplest, it's truly generic, and -- amusingly contrary to all the pseudo-grammarians who freak out about it -- it has a long history in English.

The cost of basic survival has gone way down - but in the process, it's freed up a lot of disposable income, so people build bigger, better, and yet less efficient ways of doing things to soak up that extra money.<p>Health care's perhaps the biggest example.  A hundred years ago, millions of children died in infancy from things like measles, whooping cough, polio, etc.  Now this has been wiped out by vaccines that cost maybe a day's salary for a parent (and cost the manufacturer probably pennies to make).  Same with antibiotics.<p>The money all gets spent on the other end of life.  We now have the technology to keep patients who would've died within the hour alive for months in an ICU.

Assistentialism is easy to defend, hard to attack (""you mean you should NOT help them?""), and spreads very easily, but totally fails to help, most of the time.<p>A government shouldn't build hospitals for the poor, or schools for the poor in the same sense it shouldn't have buses with separate benches for black people (""affirmative action"" programs face the same problem). It a big problem of democracy as a form of government that it encourages ""for show"", high-visibility/low-impact, governing, and assistentialism and affirmative action fit the bill perfectly. Most rulers are not trying to help the poor, but to show that they are helping the poor.<p>Back where I com from, a few decades ago, there was a system of informal government called ""coronelism"". Affluent farmers or city politicians, called ""coronéis"", would build informal support  networks around themselves (paying for a bright poor kid's education here, paying for a poor woman's surgery there, etc), and make it so that for most poor people they were the only way into having access to basic services of civilization. It was a crooked incentives game, and they elected themselves like this while laundering taxpayer money  and sabotaging any sort of project that would provide real education, health care, etc, to the poor people, as a form of keeping control. The rest of the country needed to move forward a lot before this could be suplanted.<p>I feel most affirmative action programs work in the same way. You can't criticise hospitals or housing for poor people in the same way you can't criticise the ""coronel"" for putting that bright poor kid through college and making a lawyer/doctor/engineer out of him, but neither of these actions actually change anything in the scale of society in the long term.",1279477456

Every good or service is produced by someone and consumed by someone else.  If you don't have both parties, there's no transaction.<p>When you ""save"" money, it's essentially a claim check against someone else's income.  It's a way of recording that you contributed more than your fair share to the economy this time, so at some time in the future, you have the right to consume more than your fair share.<p>If <i>everybody</i> contributes more than their fair share, who's using up the excess?

In most of the places where black people live today outside africa their immigration was mainly based on slavery and subjugation, and this comes with a really heavy cultural baggage both for the black people themselves and for the rest of the local society. And racial slavery took a few centuries to fade away, which helped build a lot of other sociological prejudices and rituals around it. At least here in brazil this is pretty obvious. That's very different from jewish immigration worldwide (based on commerce and a looser form of persecution), mexican immigration in the united states (also marginalized, but far less), asian immigration, etc. You can't discount these factors.<p>I've never been to africa, so I can't say why (and if) this phenomenon happens there, but I think european imperialism and colonialsm might be a good place to start looking for a reason. Before you think I'm a liberal nut, if the structure of a society was built for a long time around foreign domination, most people living in it will adapt to it.

Otherwise, how else do we know we're progressing or improving or at least not sucking more.<p>I agree that metrics is hard to do and easy to game. That's why don't put a specific number or targets. And also don't tight metrics with employee performance. Put it on team's performance (still not perfect, but I'm sure it's better).<p>One example of metric that probably might have made sense is that if your shop is doing Agile (code review, code coverage, unit-test, # of bugs etc.) is to make sure that these numbers don't go down in every iteration. Make sure these numbers either stay the same or go up (in the case of improvements or new development). If the numbers go down for 2 consecutive iteration, someone or some team doesn't care about quality. Track improvements, not specific number.<p>Side note: I would suggest people to read Standish Group Chaos Report to understand how bad our industry was and how far have we improved over the years.",1279476162

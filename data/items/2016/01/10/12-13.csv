It holds information about HackerOne bug bounty programs, hacker forums, vendor bulletins, different exploits databases, metasploit modules and so on.<p>The most powerful feature is built-in dorks)<p>Like this:\nAll public Yahoo vulnerabilities:<p>https://vulners.com/search?query=type:hackerone%20team.name:yahoo<p>Or maybe SQL injections?:<p>https://vulners.com/search?query=type:hackerone%20sql%20injection<p>For linux users...

10875162,comment,10872359,10873184,0,0,ssharp,,,"One of the better explanations of a/b testing I&#x27;ve read is that there are three types of uses on your site: those who will covert no matter what, those who will not convert no matter what, and those who might convert. Testing is for that final group. Thinking in those terms, you have to consider if such a large percentage fits into that &quot;might&quot; group. I&#x27;ve never personally witnessed a 60% improvement at any volume I&#x27;d bother testing on and I&#x27;ve been doing tests for many years.<p>I also think a lot of the &quot;change the button&quot; tests or &quot;increased email sign up by x times&quot; are dubious. Unless the conversion is someone giving you money, then you still have steps to go before you see real business improvement. There are lots of ways I can minipulate my traffic to make certain funnel steps look better and more optimized, but the only thing I really care about is what&#x27;s coming out of the funnel. So all those extra email signups or button pushes mean nothing if the group who perform those actions on your b version still aren&#x27;t interested in an actual purchase.",1452430741

When we use these kinds of algorithms to optimize some wanted result, we are always applying some form of reinforcement learning [1]. Reinforcement learning always needs to balance exploration and exploitation of our current knowledge, and quotas are one socially justifiable way to increase exploration - and not get stuck in self-reinforcing local maximum with a positive feedback cycle.<p>So, even from a purely utilitarian point of view, a certain amount of reshuffling of the cards (eg with quotas, but not limited to those) can be useful.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning</a>",1452430588

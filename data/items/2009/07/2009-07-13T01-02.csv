It turned out that a $27k salary was enough that I could buy all the books and pizza that I wanted, and I had nice enough computers at work that I didn't feel the need to own more myself (4mb 386-20!).<p>I could still clearly remember my state of mind when I viewed other people as being ignorant about various things, but after basically <i>doubling my programming skills in the space of six months</i>, I realized how relative it all was.

You're not buddies, you're not a charitable institution, you're not the welfare office: you do X really really well in exchange for money.

Rather than groveling about ""economic necessity"" or coming up with a list of 15 reasons you're worth the additional money, just increase your prices, put a slash through the new price, and say it is on sale (at the old price) for two weeks so get while the getting is good.

700862,comment,700666,700666,0,0,netsp,,,"Interesting Point:<p><i>We lost the ability to effectively use CPC search marketing (google). When we had a free trial, it was easy to see which clicks were worth paying for. But with freemium, the conversion funnel was so long (average of nearly a year before the person needed more storage) that any attempt to optimize price per conversion was hopeless. (Try adjusting the shower temperature with a 12 month delay between knob and temperature change and see how it goes for you. In control theory parlance, this is known as introducing a delay in the feedback loop)</i><p>It's very interesting. Anyone used to CPC lives in a world of certainty. That kind of certainty has rarely existed in marketing. The problem with that kind of certainty is that taking out risks eventually takes out returns. If you are selling a dropshipped commodity good, margins drop (cpc bids go up, prices go down) to more or less 0.<p>Freemium on the other hand, slots conveniently into the old world of TV campaigns & billboards.

Here it's hard to charge anything at all, especially if you have any kind of competition. Once you have lots of users, you try to think if any of them might be willing to pay for something.<p>- To give out a Super Sample. Get free users, when a small percent will convert to paying members. This is Chris Anderson's 95%/5% freemium.

Competing on numbers is the same as competing on price, i.e. stupid.<p>OK, maybe that is a little harsh.<p>But if you reduce yourself to competing on numbers, any numbers, you'll always be at the mercy of the biggest fool in the industry, who will one-up your numbers.  Additionally, the customers you get because your numbers are momentarily the best are disproportionately pathological customers: they have no loyalty to you, they have loyalty to The Best Deal, and when you are no longer The Best Deal they will move to the guy who is.<p>This is the same problem that plagues webhosting at the low end.  $10 at our service buys you 1 GB of hard disk and 1 GB of bandwidth.  No, wait, $10 at our server buys you 2GB/1GB!

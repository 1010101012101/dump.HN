Also at university I had someone who, over three classes taken together, had graduated from ""rubs me the wrong way"" to ""nemesis.""  It turns out that he was also there on the same scholarship.<p>The university organized a dinner every year to introduce scholarship students to their patrons.  It was at the Ritz-Carlton and I remember feeling very, very underdressed.  Anyhow, it turned out that our 90-something patron was simultaneously sponsoring about two-dozen scholarship students, so rather than doing much talking I sipped a coke and just listened to the dinner table conversation.<p>Nemesis, in his oh-so-charming way, began bragging about a civil engineering project that he had been on (""As a sophomore -- really not something many people do, you realize"") remodeling an overpass near the school.  He was going into lots of irrelevant detail -- specs, etc.  Our patron made the requisite politely interested noises and, at one point, suggested that a particular implementation detail might be improved upon.  I recall it being something like the amount of reinforced concrete required.<p>Nemesis: ""I don't know how things were when you were still working, old-timer, but I'm absolutely positive that <i>blah blah blah</i>.<p>90-something guy: ""Oh, I guess it is possible that they've improved the formula since...""<p>Nemesis: ""Since when anyhow?<p>90-something guy: ""Since I invented reinforced concrete.""<p>The gentleman passed away a few years ago and, sure enough, that was quite prominent in his obituary.",1344214652

The person charged is a human rights and justice blogger who runs a site called CopBlock where for years he has posted videos of police brutality, lawlessness and thuggery. He is a thorn in the side of the police and they are highly aware of him and watch him closely looking for slip-ups.<p>In November 2011 he recorded a 24 second long call devoid of content where the person on the other end was a desk officer in a two-party consent state. This act of recording gave them probable cause for arrest, and he is in fact guilty of the ""crime"". This is a popular tactic for dealing with social justice advocates in authoritarian regimes: watch them closely and surely they will be guilty of something eventually.<p>As Cardinal Richelieu said, ""Qu'on me donne six lignes crites de la main du plus honnte homme, j'y trouverai de quoi le faire pendre.""

Create a new branch from the one I'm working on and check it out is a common operation; it gets a flag on an existing command. What logical, coherent process decides that in each case?<p><i>Branches have only one meaning in git!</i><p>Hence the ""forces end users to do so"". There are two very common ways people use branches: one is as a temporary place to do a quick bugfix, the other is as a long-lived place to do a major rewrite or refactoring. With respect to the history of the codebase, these have very different implications, but semantically are the same type of thing in git.<p>To pick on Subversion: when you had a long-lived branch in SVN, sooner or later you'd merge it back into the mainline... and then what happens? You want someone to be able to look at the repository and see that something major happened here and easily watch the progress, but you also want a way to say ""this is done and merged"". This required inventing a convention to indicate that -- in SVN, typically the finished branches would go in an ""attic"" directory.<p>In git you face the same problem: making a temporary branch, doing the work, merging and then deleting the branch is what you're supposed to do in git. But for those long-lived major branches, you need to invent a convention (commonly, tagging the merge point) to indicate that they're done.<p>I mentioned Mercurial because it has two different concepts for these things: the ephemeral deleted-once-it's-done line is a bookmark (which is pretty much exactly equivalent to a git branch, in that it's a named head that moves as you commit), and the long-lived major branch is... a branch. Which has additional semantics to indicate things like being finished.<p>This means that in Mercurial you don't have to invent and re-invent ad-hoc conventions to handle common development patterns, while in git you do.<p><i>Can't gitk do this?</i><p>Every time I say I want to see two branches side-by-side without invoking the VCS, someone says ""well, here's a tool that invokes the VCS to do that!"" Which shows a lack of reading comprehension.<p><i>Some folks need to branch differently than others.</i><p>Sure, but why isn't there a clearly-documented ""most projects will get along fine with this"" workflow? Or, rather, why are there dozens of them? We've had VCS tools for long enough that the best practices for common cases are out there.<p><i>The github workflow might be a little tricky, but as has been pointed out there are other workflows possible in git.</i><p>Oh, there are. But git + GitHub has been relentlessly hyped as an Oatmeal-ish fantasy of unicorns farting rainbows onto a field of lollipops, so that's how people actually end up using it, and so it's valid to mention that it's a more complex workflow for contributors since it is a very common case and becoming more common.",1344212228

4343125,comment,4341533,4342826,7,0,thaumaturgy,,,"OK. Your comment history up to this point hasn't been very trollish, so I'll assume you're actually trying to be straightforward here.<p>You seem to be making the claim that Groklaw is somehow worthy of scrutiny (which implies that they are somehow dangerous, or at least influential, but I'll get to that in a moment). You're also implying that Groklaw does not have a competitor.<p>In general, you're right that demanding transparency from politically influential organizations shouldn't require a burden of proof. However, I've seen no evidence that Groklaw is either politically influential or influential in matters of law. The principals behind Groklaw may be influential in their own professional rights, but Groklaw itself is not: Groklaw does not have a horse in this race. Do you think that the judge is reading Groklaw and thinking, ""Hmm, good point""? Or that the attorneys for either side are doing the same? Or that the jurors are, which is strictly forbidden? I seriously doubt that Groklaw's analyses are having any impact on the case.<p>You're also wrong that Groklaw doesn't have a competitor, at least where this case is concerned. Groklaw has been publicly at odds with Ars Technica's Joe Mullin, even (in at least one instance that I remember) poking a little fun at him for getting the outcome of this case so wrong.<p>And, just last year, Groklaw came quite close to voluntarily shutting down (<a href=""http://www.linux-magazine.com/Online/Blogs/Off-the-Beat-Bruce-Byfield-s-Blog/Eulogy-for-Groklaw"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.linux-magazine.com/Online/Blogs/Off-the-Beat-Bruc...</a>) entirely because the SCO vs. Linux (et al) cases, which Groklaw was created to discuss, were pretty much all settled. Any suspicions of nefarious purposes on Groklaw's part would have to explain why Groklaw was so willing to just shut down at that point.<p>I don't disagree that it would be nice if there were more sites doing in-depth legal analyses of technical cases targeted for a layman audience. But, the demand for that is pretty small, and so is the supply: I expect that there aren't very many legal professionals that are at the top of the game at law and technology, and possess the ability and desire to publish in-depth analyses of cases where they aren't making any money.<p>So now the ball's in your court. Why, specifically, should we be questioning Groklaw's motives?",1344211656

Given this definition realtime systems are not bucketed in such a way that they invite a false dichotomy. For instance on one end of the spectrum you would have hard realtime systems (e.g. a pacemakers) where missing a deadline means death of the patient or serious financial loss. On the other end of the spectrum you would have soft realtime systems (e.g. facebook) where missing a deadline of say displaying a web page in under a second would constitute a system failure (revenue/engagement decrease), but still be valuable (people will put up with slow page loads, look at reddit).",1344211396

I think there's a few reasons that contracts are popular.<p>Cost, a new Iphone 4S is ~400, with a contract you effectively get it for 40 up front. Sure, over the life of the 2 year contract it might work out cheaper to buy it up front but not everybody has 400 up front and they really have their heart set on the iphone. It's basically another form of ""buy now , pay later"".<p>Convenience , a monthly paid phone will always work as long as you remember to pay the bill. My days on prepaid phones were a hassle as I remember needing to make calls and having no credit, or being cut off in the middle of a call due to running out of credit. Having to wrestle with the automated payment line in order to make an important call is a real pain.<p>Culture, There is a perception (in the UK at least) that prepaid phones are for children and drug dealers while serious grown ups will have a monthly contract. I know a few women who would consider a guy who uses a prepaid phone as a ""bad sign"" if out on a date for example.",1344211246

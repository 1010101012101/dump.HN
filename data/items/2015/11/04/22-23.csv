Not only am I fairly certain that doesn&#x27;t work too well - see your &quot;adult enough&quot; argument - there&#x27;s also no way for Mozilla to know if it has any effect.<p>I&#x27;m looking more at something like the LLVM CoC[1], which specifies how exactly disagreement should be escalated, and how it&#x27;ll be handled.<p>To me, that&#x27;s a major point of a CoC - if you have a disagreement what proper behavior is, it&#x27;s incredibly difficult to handle at the peer level. You need an escalation path. As you say, and as I alluded to above - you need someone to enforce those standards.<p>What does a CoC achieve? It sets a tone for the community, spells out what is considered unacceptable, how you can ask for help with unacceptable behavior, and what the consequences of unacceptable behavior are. Or at least the kind of CoC I refer to.<p>I completely agree that a generic feel-good document does nothing.<p>[1] <a href=""http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2015-October/091218.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2015-October/091218...</a>",1446677952

At one time, I was on 8 or 9 presciption drugs and I spent 3.5 years in constant, excruciating, please-kill-me-now pain. I reached a point where the <i>only</i> thing I wanted was to hurt less and doctors were not offering me that. My pulmonologist told me &quot;People like you don&#x27;t get well. Symptom management is the name of the game.&quot;<p>So I began pursuing alternative treatments because doctors had no hope to give me. I did whatever reduced my pain, during a time when I was routinely hallucinating conversations with The Grim Reaper. And when I hallucinated that he peered down into my face, saw something he had not seen before and turned his black steed to leave, I ran screaming after him &quot;Take me with you!&quot; I knew the death watch was over and I would live. I also knew I faced a long, hard, torturous recovery. It was a journey I had no desire to make.<p>I think there are things worse than death. And I also very much fear two things: 1) That every minute put into researching heroics like artificial hearts is a minute taken away from researching something more humane and 2) the extremely high value we place on just making sure no one dies, and quality of life be damned, gives patients like me a very grim future, even if we get the best available care and do everything &quot;right&quot; (according to our doctors).<p>That answer is not intended as dramatics or as anything screechy. It is just honest commentary on my actual experiences that my views grow out of. Your question is a very reasonable one. I think my concerns are equally reasonable. I am aware few people will side with me on this. (Perhaps none, in fact.)",1446677764

Office politics sucks enough already, we don&#x27;t want to bring another element to the workplace to make matters worse for everyone. I don&#x27;t want to see the office turned into political front lines where parties form and people take sides especially in challenging and turbulent times when the political discussions heat up and get very nasty.<p>Also, I&#x27;d like to point that this fellow engineer comes across as bit pushy with his agenda (It&#x27;s very obvious that has one). He&#x27;s treating Twitter as a political organization where he&#x27;s using his position as a conduit to further his goals as an activist advocating for change which is in my opinion very troubling and unhealthy for any business.<p>Also, it is worrisome that he didn&#x27;t perform his duties as a diversity officer[?] efficiently as it seems to me that he was only concerned about his own people, African Americans. (What about other francophone Africans? Foreigners? People of other ethnicities and regions like MENA ..etc?) He didn&#x27;t seem impartial to me at all and all what he cared about was lobbying for his own group only and this is not really commendable. You don&#x27;t join a company and start lobbying for certain outside groups like that and expect a smooth sailing. If you&#x27;re turning the company into a political battle field, you should be ready to face the consequences of your actions.<p>This brings to another equally important point which is the apparent feud or problem with the VP of Engineering regarding recruitment decisions. This activist engineer was very ambitious and at the same time shortsighted in his plans to make political gains in the organization and not expect opponents to show resistance or experience friction throughout the process. He clearly wanted to influence the decision making process if not tow and subordinate the whole department to his department which in my opinion is very naive thing of him to do and clearly revealed his motives that what he&#x27;s after is more power in the organization and not reaching a more egalitarian system or environment.<p>It was all a power play for from the get go and he wasn&#x27;t very good at it because you don&#x27;t expect to encroach on someone&#x27;s turf and not face a backlash or pushback. Even the most level-headed and good tempered person would turn territorial in these situations of adversity and things get ugly that could lead to tensions and strenuous relations between department within the organization.<p>Finally, his quitting and cop out sealed it for me as to my assessment of his account because no activist worth his salt would bail out and leave the cause he&#x27;s fighting for like this. Change doesn&#x27;t happen overnight and you gotta invest heavily and believe truly in your cause to start seeing progress. So, maybe he&#x27;s more suited to work inside a political organization that&#x27;s aligned well with his worldview and affiliation where they favor more chip on the shoulder type but he&#x27;s certainly not a good material or asset and to have on your pro team or in your business.",1446676839

Sure, you can argue (and I would agree) that math is isolated from culture, and as such, a programmer&#x27;s race can have no impact on how well he or she implements bubble sort.<p>But software development is not just about CS theory. You&#x27;re selling a product to people, and thus you introduce the human factor. If say, Facebook one day realizes they need to appeal to female users more to promote growth, does it not make sense that having female team members would be useful? That if Apple sees China as a growth market having Chinese team members will help them better target that userbase?<p>Obviously, there is no binary tree that is more friendly to the Chinese market, or black, or gay markets etc. But you can definitely change the UI, or messaging, or features that better speak to a specific culture. When architecting a feature in Facebook, a hispanic engineer could suggest a family-focused feature since she knows that family is very important in her culture. That&#x27;s not to say a white male team of devs couldn&#x27;t do a great job of satisfying a Hispanic user, but that a more diverse team might do an even better job.<p>That&#x27;s a very business-centric take on the issue. Another, more noble side to it is that there&#x27;s very likely a lot of people from underrepresented minorities who could be high quality software devs but because of their socio-economic status they were discouraged from pursing that career.

What is HTTP offering you that is better than just using a socket?

HTTP requests are also supported pretty easily (more easily than socket stuff maybe) in most languages.<p>Then, using features from HTTP where they make sense can be nice (maybe some of the status codes or ETags are useful?), but throwing the whole nebulous REST framework in there without considering how well it matches the problem or how it adds to the complexity of the solution is not a good idea.",1446676512

Top Venues, and 3. &quot;general consumers/mainstream&quot;. Each of these has different goals and needs and probably will buy a different product if they buy a product in this space at all. So my take is that this may be less a hurdle with regard to marking marketing and more of one around product.<p>Because of the way money flows in the industry, it may be better to focus on meeting the needs of venues because they will collect money directly from the transaction <i>and</i> can dictate that your service be used for bookings. Event planners on the other hand are <i>paid</i> outside the booking transaction that you&#x27;re interested in and they have venue options that are unlikely to appear in your marketplace, e.g. churches, parks, etc.<p>Good luck.",1446676073

It is up to the browser to determine if a page is AMP-compliant (following the execution of JS of the AMP project itself, loaded with the page), and if it is not (because a publisher inserts non-compliant JS, for instance) then it will fail the pre-render and load as a typical page, negating the speed benefits that AMP purports.<p>AMP does support ads, with a built in amp-ad element[0] that works with most major ad networks.

Generally engines are the primary modification, as is the CAD systems that must accept extra data and pass it to the trains.  Things like hotbox detectors that can count trains axels, determine direction plus the switches and track occupation signals need to also be sent from the CAD (which already receives them in controlled territory) to the locomotive itself.<p>As a point, PTC works in both dark territory and controlled territory, because it focuses on the train itself (but it isn&#x27;t as reliable in dark territory).  Yes in controlled territory it has greater information but it doesn&#x27;t require every switch to be modified.  Even back in the late 90&#x27;s every controlled switch reported back its status to CAD extremely quickly and CAD could control the switches remotely.  Yes, dark territory is different, but PTC had some benefits even in dark territory.  It was the long term goal to have near zero dark territory where a switch, siding or other similar factor would be able to cause a collision.<p>And just as a point, even when a train leaves one CAD controlled territory (say Union Pacific territory) and enters another (say ran by BNSF) the CAD operators hand off control, much like air traffic control.  So the issue of interoperability is minimal as it already is in place in at least a fairly common form.

The technology is pretty solid, the implementations even by competing companies are reasonable as well. The issues are political and liability, but frankly the claims are totally exaggerated on the cost, this is more about limiting future liability and changing a very ingrained old school culture.  PTC helps to provide positive proof of negligence (or the lack thereof), which as you can imagine can generate potential liability for a railroad.  PTC is not overriding of a train operator in all circumstances, hence the liability.  And the train operator and general culture is VERY rooted, even more so than the automotive industry, which means moving these long timers off the ball takes way more than some  government deadline.<p>As for not sharing costs, that is complete crap.  The railroads are not developing the technology anyway, companies like GE and others have developed it and are continuing to develop it. Even interoperation between competing implementations is mostly moot. The railroads have to pay for the software, maintenance and on-going updates, but the development is coming from outside the railroads so that political BS claim is just that.<p>Not saying everything is perfect, but it frustrates me that after 15 years this isn&#x27;t done and implemented, its 10 years beyond when I thought at least 2 of the biggest railroads would have it deployed at least in some form.  Hell in 1998 GE had forms of it in test at 2 of the largest railroads in the country.",1446674888

1293715,comment,1293119,1293607,0,0,rhl,,,"Woo. Let's chill out a bit.<p>1. I actually do like Facebook, and am very impressed by what they are pulling off.<p>2. I learned about Ponzi schemes a while back in macro theory class, before they were mainstream and irremediably tainted by the vileness of Bernie Madoff. The story of Ponzi himself -- as I remember our macro professor telling it five years ago -- is pretty 'funny', or at least provided welcome distraction between two utility maximization derivations in econ class; he's supposed to have been a 16th century Venitian who ended up in the Venice lagoon once the bankers he was pulling his cash from realized what happened. I didn't think of it as a crime. All this to say that I never implied nor intended to imply that Facebook was committing any sort of fraud, immoral behavior or else.<p>3. What I mean by this derivative thing is quite simple -- imagine the movie Speed with a bomb that explodes, not when the speed goes under X mph, but when the bus's <i>acceleration</i> goes below X mph/h, forcing the bus to keep on accelerating, driving faster and faster and faster. Eventually you'll hit the physical speed limit of the bus, acceleration will converge to zero, and the bus will explode. That's a very silly metaphor for what I was trying to explain - being that, if indeed FB had to rely on an ever growing in-flow of first time ad buyers to keep the lights up, they are would be in as desperate a situation as was Mr Ponzi in 16th century Venice.<p>Just to cool everyone's mind -- I really don't think this will happen. The team is least extremely smart to have gotten where they are, and I trust Facebook to eventually find as ridiculously profitable a business model as AdSense, with high probability. As a user I do hope it will respect my privacy, and as an entrepreneur I do hope it will allow some cool new distribution models.",1272237906

1293711,comment,1293652,1293652,0,0,jerf,,,"Interestingly, this story actually helped me once. I was debugging an issue where some people in the multi-national company I work for (many offices) could connect to the server and some people could not, and it was thanks to this story that I seriously entertained the possibility that it had something to do with timing, due to the geographical distribution of the problem reports. Subsequent investigation revealed that for various uninteresting technical reasons, the server was setting a 200ms timeout on the SSL negotiation part of the connection, which closely matched the ping times of the participants, including the people who could sometimes connect and sometimes not. And I discovered this far faster by knowing I should be poking around on timing issues, rather than searching out something deeper.<p>(I am deliberately eliding other details not relevant to this aspect of the story.

1293709,comment,1293245,1293528,0,0,Daniel_Newby,,,"""He defines information based on the frequency of 'events'.  This means that both time and 'events' are more primal than his notion of 'information'.""<p>True, but what do you expect for a popular review of a book that itself is a popular review of some pretty abstract ideas.<p>The basic concept is not just that our universe can be described by statistical measures, but that the foundational laws seem to be <i>governed</i> by statistics.  At the small scale (individual particles), quantum mechanics basically says that the universe runs itself by rolling dice in very particular ways.  Events involving these particles seem to simply be the tangible embodiment of Shannon entropy.  Even at the everyday scale of refrigerators and gasoline engines, entropy calculations are the bread and butter of thermodynamics engineers.<p>It is a major open question in physics whether entropy and statistics are truly foundational, or whether they are simply the large scale average result of a fine-grained deterministic foundation.  The ""Copenhagen interpretation"" takes statistics to be fundamental, and by gosh the calculations sure work nice, but there is no evidence that it reflects a higher truth.<p>Re. the anthropic principle in physics, it is one approach to answering why certain laws of physics seem to be balanced on a knife edge between chaos on one side and stagnation on the other.  If we posit that universes can be created with nearly arbitrary physical laws, then naturally we find ourselves in one that is neither too chaotic nor too stagnant for our existence.  The creation of such a universe might be unlikely, but given enough opportunity it is inevitable.  This allows for bizarre physical laws without requiring magic or divine intervention.  (There are even evolutionary approaches, where events like black hole formation create a new universe similar to its parent.  That way if you find yourself in a part of the multiverse conducive to your kind of life, neighboring universes are likely to be very rich in friendly conditions.)<p>""And how could it be, if we need minds and language to discuss 'information' in the first place?""<p>If the evolutionary approach were true, universes of pure thought could potentially be created, where the very atoms were symbols grounded in some reality.  A mind there wouldn't pick up a pen to draw a symbol, it would just think it into existence.  Or such a parent universe could create a universe like ours, to test whether symbol processing is a necessary law of physics, or if it can spontaneously arise from semi-chaotic fundamental laws.",1272237486

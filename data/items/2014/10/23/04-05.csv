These are HYPOTHETICAL EXAMPLES used to illustrate mission critical applications.  And be careful about making assumptions about critical systems not running Windows.  You&#x27;d be surprised.  Sometimes vendors don&#x27;t have a choice.  If you are working under a contractual obligation to use Windows, well, that&#x27;s what you use.  For example, what do you think you might find in a huge array of military Command and Control centers?  Yup.<p>You also seem to be ignoring the fact that FTDI chips typically go on all kinds of embedded systems that are attached to a computer for tasks that have nothing to do with their mission critical nature.<p>For example, we built a dedicated FPGA-based target tracking system used in such places as White Sands Missile Test Range that was entirely self contained.  It has an FTDI-driven serial port for firmware updates and configuration.  Don&#x27;t assume that everything related to USB requires full time connectivity like a keyboard or a mouse.<p>Another example is an extremely high power LED system with over 1,500 W of LEDs (much more, but that&#x27;s all I can say).  FTDI-powered USB is used to control it in real time.  And, yes, a Windows application is at the other end.  That was the spec.  And, yes, it has error correction code and a dedicated communications protocol that ensures a certain degree of safety.  If that chip is a fake there is no way to know what other &quot;features&quot; it may have.<p>Again, the HN mob is quick to be judge, jury and executioner.  That&#x27;s to be expected.  Until most of the HN crowd has another decade or two under their belt emotion will drive a lot of the thought processes.  I get it.<p>If FTDI truly intended to cause harm, of course they deserve to be sued out of existence.  What kind of a moron would not agree with that.  If, on the other hand, the issues are a side effect of code that is so fine-tuned to their devices that bad clones fail, well, that&#x27;s not their fault.  I need to go dig-up the official FTDI position on this, everything else is bullshit and conjecture.",1414039204

Judging by your response, you took my comment a little too harshly.<p>I&#x27;m trying to point out that there is a very large number of companies where open sourcing on acquisition doesn&#x27;t make sense. And there&#x27;s also very serious financial risk to founders if they choose to adopt this idea. The way you&#x27;ve stated this suggestion, I&#x27;m afraid unsuspecting founders will adopt this policy and shoot themselves in the foot a few years down the line.<p>I draw a lot of this from personal experience. I just sold my company a few months back, I currently work at an open source company (which you&#x27;ve already mentioned as one of the &quot;model&quot; OSS companies), I have first hand experience with a company getting acquired that had this &quot;open source&quot; clause a few weeks back, and I&#x27;m also heavily involved in the due diligence process for many tier 1 VCs that look to invest in the infrastructure space.<p>Having been through all of that, I can say that my personal outcome would not have been possible had I had the &quot;open source&quot; clause for my company, and we would have needed to pivot hard. The company acquired with this clause lost a vast majority of its acquisition value because of this &quot;open source&quot; clause. It&#x27;s basically become a talent acq. And from doing due diligence/working at an OSS company, it&#x27;s become clear that most founders SEVERELY underestimate the challenges in building an OSS company. It&#x27;s a double edged sword.

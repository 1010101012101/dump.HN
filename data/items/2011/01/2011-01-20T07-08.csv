There exists a graph consisting of potential truth assignments on N unknowns in M clauses consisting of 7<i>M nodes, and <48M</i><i>2 edges.<p>2. Label each node uA,uB,uC,vA,vB,vC where u? is the unknown number, and v? is whether that unknown is true or false.<p>3. Edges exist between node I and node J if either nodes I and J share zero unknowns, OR both I and J share at least one variable AND all shared variables have the same value.<p>4. For there to be an assignment that causes the full statement to be correct, you must find an M-clique (a complete graph on M nodes within the 7</i>M node graph).<p>Solving part 4 is NPC.<p>His claim is, basically, that if you permute/partition the input (to construct the tables), you can construct a disconnected graph with far fewer edges (get rid of the first part of #3 above), then add links graphs in such a way that if you can find a path from a tier-1 node to a tier-2 node, ..., to a tier-M node, examining the labels is sufficient to solve the problem. The two nasty parts are finding an efficient permutation/partition step, then managing to properly link the disconnected graphs. As you say, the two steps that the author hand-waves.",1295510389

From a practical perspective, no real efficiency breakthrough. The fact that there are now two families of algorithms with good performance for the problem is an improvement, but the fact that one of them is theoretically polynomial doesn't seem to have led to dramatic speed gains.",1295509987

Dynamic recompilation would be faster than instruction-by-instruction interpretation, but full dynamic recompilation (with subroutine caching and all) would probably get pretty difficult to time (I could be wrong), and cycle accurate timing is a stated goal for bsnes (to the point where byuu had the enhancement chips like the CX4 decapped).<p>bsnes has taken the low-level route because a decent bit of the software for the SNES is really timing sensitive - even that black circle effect at the end of the level in Super Mario World is done by changing values between scanlines.

Also, the experience of cryptography is that once cracks start appearing in an algorithm the mathematicians start trying to wedge their chisels in and hammer those cracks into fractures, into holes, and eventually into whatever you call something which no longer resembles a crack so much it resembles absence-of-wall.<p>There are specific mechanisms by which this would happen, too.  A near miss on P=NP would mean funding for professors looking into refining it, and professional interest generally, would suddenly explode.  Nobody wants to fund or work on duds, but big contributions to this problem would make careers.<p>Not incidentally, while the government funds quite a bit of academic research, this <i>particular</i> branch of mathematics is of special interest to one type of government customer which has ways of getting funding for projects expedited if they are in the national interest... and it is virtually inconceivable that they would not find very, very strong national interest in the vicinity of this result.",1295507524

First, when a user first hits ""buy"", we do a pre-authorization of their card but hold off on settlement until later in the day after the deal is closed. We generally do this for a variety of reasons, but a primary reason is that if a user happens to earn that day's deal for free through our Me + 3 program, we don't want to have to charge their card back. Instead we wait to see who has earned a free deal and then process the cards.<p>A by-product of doing the pre-auth first and the settlement later, is that we can do server side validation (i.e. check for gamers) anytime through the day until the settlement occurs and we've reconciled the transaction. What does this mean? It means that today people who think they've ""found a loophole"" just haven't been told by us yet that they're violating the one purchase per person rule. We intentionally had that happen today because we expected people to game the system and didn't want to get into a game of cat and mouse all day. That 50-75% of the purchases were gamed is laughable.<p>The ""code hack"" Martin refers to changes things on the client side, but not our server side.

2122951,comment,2121727,2122883,0,0,RiderOfGiraffes,,,"I believe you to be mistaken.  Let me explain.<p>Proving that any single NPC problem is in P will be enough to prove that every NP problem is in P, and not just the NPC ones. Suppose A is is NP, B is in NPC, and further suppose that solving B is polynomial.  Reduce A to B (a polynomial operation because B is in NPC), solve B (a polynomial operation by assumption), and convert the solution back to a solution of A (a polynomial operation because B is in NPC), and that gives a polynomial solution of A.<p>Proving that any single NPC problem is <i>not</i> in P is enough to prove that <i>all</i> NPC problems are not in P.  It would will leave in question those problems in NP, but not NPC.  Currently it is generally believed, but not known, that factoring is such a problem.<p>Added in edit, to reply to your edit:<p><pre><code>    RoG> It would will leave in question those problems

    dejb> This is exactly my point. P = NPC doesn't imply

    dejb> is in NP we haven't shown that P = NP

Read my entire comment again.  In particular, the second paragraph.  In particular:<p><pre><code>    Proving that any single NPC problem is in P will be
    enough to prove that every NP problem is in P.
</code></pre>
More specifically, proving 3-SAT is in P will prove that every NP problem, not just the NPC problems, but <i>every</i> NP problem, is in P.  Including factoring.<p>Let me add a little more.<p><pre><code>   1. Suppose 3-SAT is in P.
   2. Let A be any problem in NP.
   3. 3-SAT is in NPC.
   4. Therefore A can be converted to A', an instance of 3-SAT.
   5. By (1), A', as an instance of 3-SAT, can be solved in polynomial time
   6. Hence A has been solved in polynomial time.
</code></pre>
Replace ""A"" with factoring, and thus we've shown that P=NPC implies that factorisation is in P.",1295507153

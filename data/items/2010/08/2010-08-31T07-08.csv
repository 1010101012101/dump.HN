1648760,comment,1648585,1648585,0,0,10ren,,,"I have to admit, I have been going on for years and years because I can see that it will work, no matter how much I hate it at a particular moment. I can't claim that this is the best approach, or even a good one, but that's what I'm doing: not quitting. I guess it's not really a <i>decision</i>. In the past, a free competitor caused me to quit - but that was a mistake, because mine was still valued, so I unquit that project (but I was uninspired, so I focussed on the next one - I guess inspiration is another factor).<p>You need information to make these decisions. I like Steve Blank's idea that your startup is a process for finding answers to questions, like <i>here's my idea, I think these people will need it - do they?</i> Try to get this information as early as possible - before version 1.0, before version 0.1, before any version, before any planning or design. Some questions will require a version 0.1 to find the answer.<p>So, try to formulate the specific questions, that if you had factual answers to them, it would be obvious to you whether to stick/pivot/quit. Then work at obtaining those facts (instead of at ""keep pushing forward"".) Some of them, by their nature, might take a long time or a lot of work to obtain; but because they are concrete, specific and factual, it's easier for you to decide whether it's worth finding the answer or not. Or, just by thinking in these terms, a brilliant short-cut for getting this information might come to you.  [Note: I haven't actually talked to customers, which his approach says to; but I have researched my questions in other ways, which was very revealing.]<p>Some startups also have engineering questions, is this technologically feasible, can I get this to work? A similar approach applies, where you try to solve the bare essence of the problem first; customers can't tell you about this aspect. [Note: I do this all the time; unfortunately the basic ""is it usable?"" question can require a substantial prototype - a lot of work]",1283241459

It's just about the way your brain is wired.  Good programmers have a specific something wrong with their brain that makes them ridiculously good at logic, and, sadly, not very good at much else.  We can overcome the ""everything else"" part through hard work, though we'll never be as good at it as you.

No case is made for why anyone else should care about that. I'm sorry if that sounds harsh, but no one gives a shit about your opinion about various events. Moreover, the site seems to do a bit of everything rather than focus on a clear topic, which is probably why you don't get many subscribers. People looking for movie reviews won't subscribe to your site because of the geeky articles. People looking for geeky articles won't follow you because they don't want to be spammed with your movie reviews. And neither of those two groups of people will be interested in your cat pictures.<p>You also appear to have a severe disdain for 3. Well, there, once again, this may sound harsh, but get real, dude. Cases where some undiscovered genius suddenly gets famous through no fault of his own are one in a billion. Almost every success comes with some amount of self-promotion. Post your articles on social news sites. Get feedback. Improve. Connect with the community. Relentlessly put your site out there, on Twitter, on Facebook, everywhere. Post comments on other people's blogs. Submit your articles to Slashdot. Keep at it until you get through. It might take months, or even years. If you don't actively do it, though, it will never happen.<p>You need to answer the following questions. If you can answer them satisfactorily, your blog readership will increase substantially:<p>1) Why should anyone care about my blog?<p>2) Who should care about my blog?<p>3) Will these people be annoyed by any part of my blog?<p>4) How am I promoting my blog to get to these people?<p>5) How am I connecting with these people as human beings rather than just readers?<p>Good luck!",1283241024

For instance, just because you can send over changes to the DOM, you can't necessarily reproduce the javascript side-effects, exactly. You can't just poll the state of the DOM because it doesn't reflect all of the state that lives in javascript closures that you can't even see.<p>One easier method, and probably what they did in this demo, is simply catch <i>any</i> user-generated event in browser A and re-emit it in browser B, thus letting the existing javascript code / browser logic do any actual DOM/state modification.<p>But what happens when each user triggers an DOM event at the same time? They end up getting applied in reverse order on the two browsers. In many cases this can cause the two browsers to fall out of sync.<p>Anyway, I love seeing WebSocket demos, and this is pretty fun.

Why would you use the term 'get a blog' repeatedly in your copy if 'start a blog' had 20x the search volume?<p>If your site includes embeddable widgets for users you probably give yourself some kind of back link. Why would you waste that link anchor text on just your domain 'ManageProject.ly' instead of a term you want to rank for, like 'Online Project Management'?<p>If you totally ignore SEO and call it 'bullshittery' then you can't complain when your site doesn't rank well.<p>Google primarily focuses around a site's authority.

They have a comic book design for the review.  They have better images than most of the reviews, which just recycle the same publicity kit, and they integrate them better.  They link to content readers will find quite compelling, such as ""Every Video Game Reference in the Scott Pilgrim Comics.""  A random newspaper reviewer in Kansas isn't chasing that stuff down.<p>#3: 1UP review of the video game.  Three words: ""query deserves diversity"", which is Google's way of saying ""Hey, maybe they actually didn't want a review of Scott Pilgrim the movie.  That query was ambiguous.  Maybe they meant the videogame instead.  In that case, we should surface a few results on the front page so they don't get frustrated.""  It isn't a particularly compelling review, but it is a less competitive niche and a noted brand.<p>#4: Internal Google callout for Google News results.  This is their sop to a dying industry which has worse problems than you ever will, for similar reasons which are exacerbated by their cost structure.  The current best ranked review from Google News is from the University of Dayton's school newspaper.  It is as good as one would expect.<p>#5: Wiki.  More pagerank than God.

I daily run into issues that I don't understand. That's what programming <i>is</i> for me, I'm afraid; rather like science. It's a sequence of monsters. The best we can do is to be tackling new monsters, not the same ones.<p>Of course, programming jobs do exist where you do the same thing over and over again. And there's a threshold of skill required before you can automate some classes of things; and you also need a clear understanding of the task, to see precisely which aspects are mechanical, and which aspects are configurable. It pretty quickly gets into compsci research. And sometimes it's not worth the effort (it can take a <i>lot</i> of effort.)<p>But if you've ever called a method twice, instead of writing the code twice, then you have done some of it.<p>I feel that your question ""start to make sense"" suggests your thinking is all-or-nothing. Does <i>no</i> aspect of programming make sense to you - or do some ""trivial"" aspects make sense but they ""don't count""? Does a print statement make sense to you, to some extent? Does a loop make sense to you? There's a continuum of mastery. If you only acknowledge perfect and complete mastery as ""mastery"", then you won't feel any satisfaction in mastery of one small bit of it.

The in-house engineers know what's going on, and what management wants ratified, but they're supposed to work with this consulting firm. The engineers at the consulting firm know that they're probably being asked to ratify some already-made decision, and their job is basically to find out what it is and recommend that. Early on, the in-house engineers just spill to the beans to the consulting firm's engineers, and both groups more or less take it easy for three months, short-circuiting the usual charade while management on both sides thinks that some sort of consulting dance is going on.",1283238726

1648687,comment,1648594,1648594,0,0,minouye,,,"I think it's a balance.  The content generation mills focus on generating keyword dense, SEO friendly articles at the expense of quality.  It sounds like you have generated vast amounts of quality content at the expense of any sort of marketing.  Keep in mind that 2000 articles is nearly 6 posts a day for an entire year.  If I assume each article took roughly 20 minutes to write, that is 666 hours or writing (coincidence I swear!).  Again, to balance that writing time out, let's say you devote a mere 2% of that writing time to marketing.  That would come to about 13 hours.  A 98/2 split seems fair enough to me, and I would imagine that 13 hours spent marketing your writings would result in significant and sustained traffic increases. If you feel that white-hat SEO isn't your thing (which I think is highly inadvisable), just spend that time sending emails or reaching out to friends.  If you write it, and you don't market it, they won't come.",1283238102

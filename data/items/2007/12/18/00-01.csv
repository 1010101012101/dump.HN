As with Microsoft, they do lots of things that are failures on their face but serve secondary purposes.<p>A free 411 service that is promoted in lots of odd places. Duh, they want to train a speech-to-text parser, and that's the best way to do it.<p>Gmail is much better than Yahoo Mail but lags behind, it was invite-only, etc. But they have a very valuable probe into people's mailing habits. Spam usually needs a link, so they can better detect and remove spam pages from their index. And via the invite map, they have a nice graph of connections and influences between people. I'll bet cash they've used email analysis to gauge the price of new keywords or even the ""buzz"" index of startups.<p>Free website analysis? Free wireless? Free ""web accelerators""?

Exercise in the sun and the open air is preferable.\n2) Eat a simple vegetarian diet with lots of colorful fruits and vegetables.\n3) Restrict calories, eat slightly less than needed. \n4) Fast once a week.\n5) Use the mind: converse, read, write.\n6) Find something useful to do, a reason to live. Victor Frankl's experience in the concentration camp comes to mind: a person with a strong purpose can endure much.\n7) Play music, sing, or at least listen to good music.\n8) Avoid contact with cats, because of Toxoplasma gondii, a parasite that gets into the brain of its hosts and affects it.<p>\nTo me, these all seem like common sense measures for good physical and mental health, maybe to you too, but I've been to nursing homes and hospitals where the patients are treated in the opposite way: kept sedentary and indoors, overfed greasy processed foods, relieved of responsibilities that give purpose, and fed an intellectual diet of TV.

Although, I don't think that you're going to hurt anything if you try herbal stuff.  But, the problem is, with the brain, once the damage is done, it's done, because the hardware/software is broken.   And, certainly, if you want a second or even third opinion, by all means, go ahead and get them.  Be sure you've gotten an MRI at some point, and seen a Neurologist.  There are a few diseases like heavy metal poisoning that can cause similar symptoms.  But again, even with those, once the damage is done, it's done, and there isn't much you can do when it's rea<p>About the only good thing about Alzheimer's is that the person really doesn't suffer much, because they forget what they are going through.  Although periods of agitation and frustration are common.  <p>The worst thing about Alzheimer's is it's effect on the family.  It's known as ""The long goodbye"" because it is such a slow, debilitating disease.  The family slowly sees the loved one disappear week after week.  It is heart wrenching.  <p>Keeping the patient as mentally active as possible has been proven to delay the progression of the disease.  Surrounding the patient with familiar objects that they've had around for years can be reassuring.  Some of the best dementia units in skilled nursing facilities that I've seen have an ""antique row"" or a hallway filled with antiques"" that the patients can wander back and forth in that often reassures them.  <p>But, probably the best thing that can be done for the patient as well as the family, is to sit around and talk about memories.  Talk about the good times, and tell stories about each other.  It helps the family to grieve and because the long term memories are the last to go, it helps give the patient a sense of the familiar, and that's usually reassuring.  <p>Hang in there, man.  It's tough.",1197936822

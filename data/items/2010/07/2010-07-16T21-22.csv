It was nothing out of the ordinary except the stream of cards just kept coming. By the end of the hour, he had sent in 470 contacts. We completed them fairly quickly, but out of curiosity we calculated exactly how much manhours we spent processing his cards.<p>19.93 HRs.<p>Arguably that's how much time he saved, because he didn't have to do everything on his own.

Interestingly, in the small number of cultures where it does exist, the men are always brothers -- presumably this is the only way to get the situation to work without the men killing each other and/or children which they suspect to not be theirs.<p>I haven't read Sex At Dawn, but human mating really has very little in common with bonobo mating.

COM combined with a rampant NIH disease and competing coding guidelines results in a pretty gnarly mess.<p>Ignoring for a moment the endless wars between those who are for one particular style or library and those against, and the slight differences in the amazing number of different string types (they number in the dozens at least), I think the worst of it comes from COM.  Rather than use language or library support, they reinvent <i>everything</i>.  Now, granted, in this case it lets them do some pretty nifty things (like instantiating objects on remote machines and invoking methods there as if they were native), but the way you end up doing everything with these opaque macros (that are, if you can find where they're defined, usually written unsafely, by the way) just seems too magical, and the idea of passing around GUIDs for fuck all is just crazy.  Too many times have I had a problem that, even in the debugger, was completely incomprehensible and unimaginable in traditional or UNIX C/C++, and after asking around and waiting for responses, amounted to ""oh, just take that magic incantation out of your header because it's fucking with your vtable and you don't need it"" or ""oh just rebuild everything because your old GUIDs aren't valid"" or something.<p>Most of my time is spent wandering around blindfolded in a room while angry hungarians pelt me with college-aged black boxes, to the point that I'd say no more than 4% of my time debugging has been spent actually fixing real problems with my own code that I might have made outside of this environment.<p>Ahhh, that felt good.

I have seen some similar issues in the Seattle area when moving from one part of the city to the next; the signal is at full strength, but the call suddenly drops, almost as if I'm crossing a boundary.  Now, I preface this by saying I know little to nothing about the cell phone network handles calls, but thinking about this made me wonder if it had anything to do with handing off the connection from one tower to the next.  Maybe it's better to have fewer, higher power towers to minimize hand-off than many low powered ones.  Of course, that's exactly what most people don't want: high powered cell towers blasting them with radiation.<p>But I have to wonder if this problem is exaggerated by the 3G connection maintained by the phone.  My dad used to have the same problem in NY (not the city), but he switched to edge and stopped dropping the calls. He just turns on 3G when he knows he wants to do some faster web browsing, which is rarely for him.  Maybe you could try turning off your 3G and see if it reduces your problem in LA?",1279315688

The problem is really with the rest of the world: if indeed the person is important, why haven't any historians or journalists ever written about him/her?

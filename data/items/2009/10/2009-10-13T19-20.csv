Specifically, applications that do interesting things with social graphs have to go beyond basically doing message passing.<p>I naturally look at things from a recommendations angle, but if you've got a new edge that enters the graph that may affect other edges that are connected to the end points.  Those may in turn affect the edges that are connected to those nodes and so on.  You want to avoid something that effectively becomes a breadth first traversal of the graph doing updates since that's well, slow, to put it mildly.<p>This is why large-scale graph algorithms like PageRank work on constantly regenerating static matrices rather than doing regeneration of the ranks dynamically, but that naturally is problematic when you're working on data sets where the most recent data is the most important and is being generated at very high rates.",1255463955

I would be more cautious if it is an opportunistic teaming than if you know your co-founder fairly well and have a good sense about his character. This also assumes that the contributions are equal.  50/50 is a bad idea just to achieve a sense of comity if one founder is in fact more of a contributor than the other.<p>If you do have doubts of any kind, then you can usually achieve formal voting control even if the equity interests are otherwise equal by using a simple voting agreement to assure this. In such a case, there is a delicate balance  between formal control mechanisms and the ""spirit of the deal,"" which you shouldn't violate lest you do damage to the important relationship you have with someone as important as a co-founder.",1255463782

Qwanz is a polling site, with one key feature: once you've answered a poll, it gives you some next steps you can take -- including political / media / business figures who can actually use the information.<p>For example, someone who voted in this poll (<a href=""http://www.qwanz.com/poll/245/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.qwanz.com/poll/245/</a>) about Olympia Snowe could then forward the results to Snowe's press secretary (or call their office directly).<p>Qwanz is a startup with a thesis, and the thesis is simple: people fill out polls because they care about issues. If they really care, they'll welcome the chance to make a bigger difference.<p>Your feedback is appreciated! We're in the very early stages, so HN's comments will play an important role in what Qwanz does next.<p>Here are some Qwanz polls on what Qwanz should be doing:<p><a href=""http://www.qwanz.com/poll/248"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.qwanz.com/poll/248</a><p><a href=""http://www.qwanz.com/poll/247"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.qwanz.com/poll/247</a>",1255463755

There are other ways to interpret the output. See, for example, ""Visualizing Higher Layer Features of a Deep Network."" by Erhan et al 2009:
<a href=""http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~lisa/publications/?page=publication&kind=single&ID=247"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~lisa/publications/?page=publica...</a><p>It is true, though, that more powerful models are less explainable. But in return you have more compact modeling and training via gradient descent. This is faar faster than the combinatorial optimization involved in ensembles of trees. (Trust me, I've implemented both.)<p><i>there isn't a way to cluster similar cases together to analyze what rules bind different decisions together</i><p>""PCA analysis of activations of the hidden layer. Could also do k-means clustering of activations of hidden layer.""<p>I concur. However, for 2-d or 3-d visualization, you should use the more recently developed t-SNE algorithm instead of PCA or other alternatives. t-SNE does waay better.
Software (in Matlab and Python) is available at:
<a href=""http://ict.ewi.tudelft.nl/~lvandermaaten/t-SNE.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ict.ewi.tudelft.nl/~lvandermaaten/t-SNE.html</a><p>Also, you should look at the JMLR paper (<a href=""http://ict.ewi.tudelft.nl/~lvandermaaten/t-SNE_files/vandermaaten08a.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ict.ewi.tudelft.nl/~lvandermaaten/t-SNE_files/vanderm...</a>) and supplemental material (<a href=""http://ict.ewi.tudelft.nl/~lvandermaaten/t-SNE_files/SupplementalMaterial.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ict.ewi.tudelft.nl/~lvandermaaten/t-SNE_files/Supplem...</a>), to see the visualizations produced by t-SNE and competing methods. This qualitative evaluation by looking at pictures speaks for itself.<p><i>Also, one cannot find the partial dependence of the output on a given input variable.</i><p>If your model assumes that the output is a non-linear combination of inputs, then yes, it is hard to express the output in terms of a linear decomposition. But that was your choice of modelling assumption, presumably because linear models are insufficiently powerful to fit the underlying variations.<p>""The random forest classifier looks interesting, I'll have to investigate that. Any suggestions for papers/tutorials?""<p>Random forests were developed by Leo Breiman (RIP).<p>""Ensemble methods in machine learning"" by Diettrich (2000) compares different tree ensemble methods. He concludes that boosting an ensemble of decision trees is better, except when the data are very noisy, in which randomized trees are better. (Boosting is when you focus on the examples that the model is currently doing the worst. Randomized instead works on random subsets of examples.) The main reason boosting is worse than randomized trees in the noisy case is because the AdaBoost exponential loss is sensitive to outliers. Which is to say, AdaBoost boosts the wrong loss function. Boosting an appropriate choice of loss function (perhaps a regularized log-loss) is probably superior to randomized trees in most circumstances.<p>""Improved boosting algorithms using confidence-rated predictions"" by Schapire and Singer (2000) is a great introduction to boosting.<p>Around the same time Llew Mason and Jerome Friedman  independently demonstrated that boosting is essentially fitting an additive model using gradient-based methods to select the features that have the steepest loss gradient. So you should follow up by looking at their work.",1255463656

Their partitioning leads to clean interfaces: command line options, file formats, or protocols, without which the parts could not be usefully combined.

  - browser plugins/toolbars
  - ajax circuit simulator
  - an AdSense-type widget to help engineering forums monetize their sites
</code></pre>
Finally, I think that each node in our category map needs a specialized UI. Since we have 1000's of categories there's endless room for improvement there. Top of the list are:<p><pre><code>  - power supply picker
  - capacitor picker
  - opamp picker
</code></pre>
Any other ideas???",1255460557

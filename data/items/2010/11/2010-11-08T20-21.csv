1883965,comment,1883286,1883517,0,0,pyre,,,"I think that it's much more readable due to familiarity more than anything else. The C syntax for the ternary operator was the one thing that it took me the longest time to get used to when learning to program. I usually just ignored it because it was too hard to remember what it did. That said, I can easily read it now, but I still feel that the Python syntax is more understandable.<p>Which is more readable:<p><pre><code>  > condition ? value1 : value2
</code></pre>
or<p><pre><code>  > value1 if condition else value2
</code></pre>
Maybe the latter is just more readable to me because I'm used to reading Perl all day long that looks like:<p><pre><code>  > die unless condition;
  > return true if condition;
  > return false
  >     if condition1 && condition2 && condition3;
</code></pre>
That said, I'm also used to reading:<p><pre><code>  > return condition1   ? value1
  >        : condition2 ? value2
  >        : condition3 ? value3
  >                     : value4;
</code></pre>
and I still find the Python ternary operator more readable:<p><pre><code>  > return value1 if condition1 else
  >        value2 if condition2 else
  >        value3 if condition3 else
  >        value4</code></pre>",1289249576

By having the client pay hourly you put the ""risk"" of the project on his shoulders, but you also limit yourself to earning <i>only</i> a hourly rate. Why is that bad? An experienced programmer might accomplish a task/project quickly due to having done similar projects and have an arsenal of code/examples/tools at his disposal. An experienced programmer might be able to get 20%-30%  markup on his hourly fee but he might finish the project five times as fast as another less experienced programmer might.<p>You won't be able to leverage your gray hairs and the time they save you as efficiently with an hourly fee.<p>If the project is well-defined you might be tempted to accept a fixed price and crank it out quickly  which will net you more money per hour. I'd advice holding of atleast a week even if you do it in a day or two or the customer will start questioning your price ;)<p>If the project/customer is  fast and loose with the spec and functionality (as most projects are) you're in dangerous terroritory where constant changes keeps eating away at your time.<p>If you can get a high hourly fee and the project is fuzzy, go for it, meetings and stuff like that will earn you a bunch anyways.<p>Another strategy is to split the project into discrete parts and charge a fixed price for each (negotiating each one), that way it's easier to define the scope of the project and it eliminates risk both ways. It also gives you and the customer have a chance to get to know each other before committing to the project and helps avoid being in the clutches of a psychopath customer.",1289249489

The biggest components of the manufacturing sector are things that most people probably don't immediately associate with manufacturing. For example, agricultural products are a huge component. As are primary industries like logging. Processed chemicals represent another big chunk. Most of the factory goods that fit the traditional definition of manufacturing are industrial equipment like earth-movers or electrical transformers. Note that these are all capital-intensive industries that are either protected by tariffs and subsides, or bulky, cost-sensitive goods that aren't as easy to build at a profit overseas.<p>On the other hand, the mass-market consumer product industries that most people think of as synonymous with manufacturing have been wiped out in the US.",1289249322

1883916,comment,1883679,1883679,0,0,TomOfTTB,,,"Interviewer: I've heard that there was a project where Microsoft started to integrate Haskell on .NET and then it was replaced with the F# project. Is that true? If it's true, why?<p>Don Syme: That's a small part of the sequence. The visional design of the .NET platform was very much expected to be a multilanguage platform from the start. Right back in 1998, just in fact as our research group in programming languages started at Microsoft and I joined the team and then other 10 of us joined the team, we were approached by a guy called James Plamondon, who started the project called Project 7, which was about getting 7 academic and 7 industrial programming languages on each side to target the .NET common language runtime and really check out if it was good enough, to see if design changes could be made early on in the design process of .NET to make sure it was good enough for a range of programming languages.<p>Some of those design changes were made, like tail calls were, for example, were added in the first version of .NET and that was a very interesting project because they gave a lot of way to our group and researchers at Microsoft to make connections between the academic programming world and .NET. We have seen that there are a lot of people working on .NET over the years, and also let our group work directly on .NET with regard to .NET Generics and other proposed extensions to .NET - we got these researchers engaged with the system.<p>We sort of knew there were opportunities to do new languages, but to contribute to existing languages like C# and also to do new languages in this kind of context. We talked a lot about doing a systems programming language of some kind, something that would effectively sit between C and C#, that you'd be able control memory usage and maybe get safety properties at the systems programming level.<p>We ended up not pursuing that, although people are still interested in doing ""managed"" systems languages, say languages you could drive a whole operating system in or write large portions of Windows in. Then, at the other end, we are interested in doing these expressive functional languages. Haskell .NET was something we looked at closely, we always had in mind to do NML as well, there is a project called SML.NET, which is a very good implementation of standard ML for .NET with a Harley optimizing compiler and the like. We learned a lot from that - a great project!<p>==== The paragraph below is the most relevant to the Question ====<p>I took what I learned from .NET Generics and saw that there was a chance to do a ML like language fitted very closely with .NET. During this time we had a go doing Haskell for .NET, we actually got a long way in doing that, but in the end there is quite a lot of dissonance between Haskell and .NET. The purity is one aspect of that so you are writing monadic code whenever you use the .NET libraries, which would be perhaps unusual, would lead you to writing more monadic code than you would like. Also, Haskell didn't have any tradition of adding object oriented extensions to Haskell.<p>====================================================<p>There was one project called O'Haskell, which was interesting, but there was something about Camel which had a tradition of taking a call language and then making extensions to it, changing it, experimenting it, but taking a core paradigm that works very well and then making it fit to a context. In a sense, in Haskell there are too many points where the model wasn't going to work in the context of .NET and you get too much dissonance across the interoperability boundary in particular - actually there are some serious challenges in making it run well at all. That was definitely an interesting project and I think a few other people have tried the Haskell .NET, but we didn't continue with the project.<p>Source: <a href=""http://www.infoq.com/interviews/F-Sharp-Don-Syme"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.infoq.com/interviews/F-Sharp-Don-Syme</a>",1289249067

LORAN is a wonderfully simple, rugged aid to maritime navigation, but it is no substitute for GPS.<p>Modern radio systems are so slick and mature that it is easy for us to imagine that they are a magical force akin to electronic telepathy, but they are reliant on simple electromagnetic radiation and highly susceptible to interference. Beyond the obvious issues of space weather, propagation and accidental interference, most radio systems are trivially easy to deliberately interfere with and we are now at a stage where intersatellite conflict could cause massive destruction.

By ""micro"" errors I mean some poorly drawn diagrams and some grammar errors that break my flow. I noticed that no editor is credited, and the book would be improved with an editor. Too many micro errors can hurt a books credibility (if they didn't take the time to polish the book can I really trust the content?).<p>On the other hand, I think the advice in this book is fantastic. Two examples of things discussed:<p>1) Deciding what type of market you are entering (existing, re-segmented, new) and the consequences of each market type.<p>2) Confirming your hypothesis before you try to scale.<p>Get past the micro errors. The content really is quite good. Or I <i>think</i> it's good. What the hell do I know.

This experiment proved that it was possible for one man to loose weight eating only junk food. I'm not a statistician, but I'm going to guess that a sample size of 1 is too small to generalize. There was also no competing hypothesis tested in this experiment. A trial was not done where the nutritional value of the food was tested.<p>Anyway, in my anecdotal experience, I've been able to go from 205 back to my college pole-vaulting weight of 185 by following a 40-30-30 ratio of calories from fats, carbs, and protein without ever worrying about total calories.

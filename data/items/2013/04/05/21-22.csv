5501339,comment,5500388,5500684,3,0,trhtrsh,,,"It has nothing to do with ""comfortable folks producing for the government"" and everything to do with coordinating production and consumption.\nIf everyone produces for 20 years and accumulates money, and there is no inflation for 20 years, and then they all try to retire and spend it, but there is no one to produce, since everyone wants to retire, you get hyperinflation chasing the small amount of available goods. Alternatively you inflate the currency for 20 years, to encourage people to consume their savings as a sustainable pace.<p>Remember: if you spend your inflationary money NOW on durable goods (canned food, wood, whatever), then you can trade those goods for inflated currency later, and not lose any value.<p>But, if you don't spend your money (maybe because there is nothing on the market worth buying), then inflation is the natural correction to bring the money supply into balance with the goods supply.",1365199184

Most people that aren't really into tech, as well as most people outside the age range of, say, 14-40, are completely unable to avoid accidentally installing browser toolbars. These are not dumb people. They know what toolbars are, how they get on their system, and what to look out for. Still, it happens. Because, oops.

5501131,comment,5499377,5500906,1,0,base698,,,"An argument you hear a lot, particuarly from Keynsian economists is: bitcoin is bad because it's deflationary like gold.<p>In the past when we were using gold, like during the Civil War, we couldn't pay soldiers so we went to greenbacks (paper money like today).  That allowed the soldiers to get paid so we could continue to fight the war.  Gold obviously has a physical practical limit that can be traded and transfered.  When a gram becomes worth so much it buys a house that makes other purchases of food and bills become impractical and people stop buying, and when building a billion dollar construction project moving it and protecting it has another set of problems and overhead.  Bitcoin does not have the division problem--a single coin can be divided into pieces 10^8 pieces as the code currently works.  That can also be changed in future versions to be divided even smaller.  Ie, when one bitcoin can buy a house, you can just pay 0.0000001 for your stick of gum.  So, we are then left with the argument, ""Oh My God people won't buy because of the psychology that 0.01 coin today that currently buys a pack of gum being able to buy a car in the future.""  But, that's almost true now with savings and stocks and people still spend their money today and go into debt.  Everyone knows if you save starting in your early 20s compounding interest it will be worth a ton more in 10 years, 20 years, etc.<p>Loans clearly have issues in a deflationary system.  If you loan someone $10 today and that's worth $100 tomorrow how do they ever have a chance to pay it back?  Payback would have to be on some growth rate where you owe ""less"" the longer the life of the loan with some interest built in.  Venture Capital also would have issues, but if the rate of return on investments is greater than growth of the currency price that wouldn't be an issue either and one would expect it to stabilize over time.<p>Inflation is built into the current model to encourage investment and prevent concentration of capital.  Clearly, given the wealth divide that isn't working (blame exploitation of 3rd world or robots).  The argument from the anarcho-libertarians and socialist-libertarians is to try something new.",1365197255

It is not so much a currency at the moment, it is more like an asset, like stocks, bonds, or gold.  If we assume bitcoin is an asset, we are not seeing deflation per se, we are seeing an increase in value.<p>A store of value that can be anonymously transferred and exchanged without significant costs has some inherit value in society.  The only problem with bitcoin, is that if we consider bitcoin to be an asset, than it's price is entirely determined by speculation and nothing else.  At least with gold, there are industrial/commercial uses for it that put a lower bound on the price.  Not so much with bitcoin.  Personally, I don't need an anonymous store of value, so if I am going to be speculating, I would rather do so with stocks of companies, as those are actually backed by the value of the company itself.  I may throw some money into bitcoin just for fun, but I wouldn't do it to use it as a currency.  My gut is telling me that most people jumping in are not interested in using it as a currency either.<p>Of course, this doesn't necessarily mean bitcoin won't become more like a currency in the future.

For example, there could be popular support for a ""Protecting Net Freedoms"" act and something good could be introduced. But the special interest lobbyists would likely get a large amount of edits in, and the ""provisions"" added for ""protecting (children|national security|the environment)"" and ""creating jobs"".<p>So at the end of the day, passing a ""Protecting Net Freedoms"" act would likely be worse than the status quo (which in the US is still quite good IMHO).",1326736686

3471640,comment,3470900,3470900,1,0,diwank,,,"tl;dr -<p>I think I fixed this problem in my app (iheartpy.com) using AIML. Caution: Still a work in progress.<p>The whoe thing -<p>I am a self-taught programmer. And I had been an extensive user of codeacademy myself. I realized this rather serious design flaw early on and tried to do something about it.<p>Initially, I tried to right my own engine based on JSON but midway I discovered AIML. It suited the task perfectly. So I downloaded pyAIML library [1]. It is surprisingly simple to get started with. I hacked around a bit and got a workable python app.<p>Finally using pyAIML + regexp, I ended up with a crude engine that takes something like this (in Python):<p><pre><code>      def foo(param1, param2)\n</code></pre>\nand spits out:<p><pre><code>      FUNCTION foo PARAMS param1 param2\n</code></pre>\nwhich can be easily manipulated and replied to by the pyAIML parser. It worked flawlessly. And moreover, designing lessons is as simple as creating an XML file.<p>Then I threw together a minimal UI and got it up and running on App Engine here:<p><pre><code>      iheartpy.com\n</code></pre>\nI used CodeMirror [2] for the editor. The focus of the UI was to be extremely minimal ( = blazing fast) and delightfully non-distracting ( = no post-to-facebook rubbish). This being a side-project, I thought I could easily get away with that. :)<p>Honestly, this is my first project and looks more like the work of a script-junkie at this point of time. The lessons are not done yet. I wasted a lot of time in trying to optimize my app for App Engine. And now I'm an 18 year-old who has a LOT of exams on his head and this unfinished project. It is kinda disheartening.<p>Anyway here's the github repo [3]. It is not very neat. Psst.. I added some LOLPython magic as well [4]!<p>Finally, I made something that is essentially an MVP. I'm new to both design and coding. Plus, I don't think I'm proficient enough in Python to teach people.<p>In short, I need help. Would be happy enough with some feedback, though. ;)<p>[1] <a href=""http://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyAIML"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyAIML</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://github.com/marijnh/CodeMirror2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/marijnh/CodeMirror2</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://github.com/creatorrr/IHeartPy"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/creatorrr/IHeartPy</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.dalkescientific.com/writings/diary/archive/2007/06/01/lolpython.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dalkescientific.com/writings/diary/archive/2007/0...</a>",1326736313
3471639,comment,3470900,3471339,1,0,tiptup,,,"Agree with you about Codecademy's assumption/expectation of a layperson's understanding is ambitious but your expectation of what needs to be explained kinda deviates from their aim. Yes, they should've expanded on some concepts but Codecademy should really concentrate on the 'what' and not the 'why' as that can be developed afterwards. Spending most teaching on the 'why' (like most adult learners would do) early on will put off some users off as they do not feel they are 'doing' much and quit/move onto something else.<p>It is obvious the users' background covers a wide spectrum so Codecademy would have to draw a line somewhere and say here's the pre-requisites prior to starting the intro coding course. They may need to provide this background knowledge via a pre-sessional/foundation/principles course (or pintpoint users where to go if they don't) covering the barebone basics of computer science and computing as a task.<p>Whether 'the hard way' is the best is really up to the learner - people learn in different styles so whatever gets their attention really. As a suggestion , Codecademy should provide a list of additional resources for eager learners who wants to understand the underlying concepts and/or provide links to other courses if this particular course is not useful for them.",1326736304

As much as I like to be cynical at times, I sincerely believe there are lot of good professors at these institutions who sincerely believe that education should be free.  Take for example MIT's push to have all their publications made open access, this was driven (in it's early stages) largely by Hal Abelson and a few other dedicated faculty/staff.<p>Top professors at top universities have a lot of clout, and despite the many issues there are with the current system of higher ed, I do believe that a lot of this work is sincerely driven by the ideals of good professors. Look at the interviews with Sebastian Thrun regarding the AI course, he clearly believes in finding a models of maximizing the quality to cost ratio for education.<p>Culturally I think places like Stanford, Harvard and MIT know well that many times you don't find your business model until you experiment, and if you want to be in charge of the future you have to be the one doing the experimenting.  I think the angle that sells this to admins is that if you're a leading university you want to be pushing these boundaries, and if you want to be a head of the curve you need to be.",1326735752

The books tells you to type things first; the explanation comes later.<p>In my experience, the most important part of learning to program is that you can do something fun, quickly.  If you enjoy the programming, you will continue with it, and then bother to learn the ""why""'s.  If you don't find it fun, why would you bother learning ""why""?<p>The Code Academy tutorial isn't perfect, but I do think it's a fun introduction.  Importantly, it's a fun introduction that require almost no set up.  I know it has limitations, but it is pretty awesome, and a much better path into Ruby than a lecture on object oriented programming.<p>Not to knock the lecture.  It's very important, in fact.

I really really wanted to learn, so I've tried going to local meetups designed to teach newbies to code and I've tried Codecademy.<p>The problem I found was this tendency to start with the terminal as the teaching tool. The terminal is a black and intimidating hole to a beginner. Sure, I happily typed in 2+2 and got 4 as a result, and I understood how to store variables and even if statements and while loops, but honestly, I found this to be too abstract. I didn't understand what the terminal was and how typing in 2+2 was supposed to help me build a website, which is why I wanted to learn to code to begin with. I got frustrated and quit learning to code for a while as a result.<p>But then I decided to try out the free Stanford CS106A course. I was hooked from the very first lecture. Instead of starting at the terminal, Stanford had me download Eclipse (which is less intimidating than the terminal) and they started with a fun ""Karel the Robot"" language. In the first assignment, my goal was to make Karel the Robot run around the grid and drop / pick up diamond 'beepers'. I LOVED it. The excitement I got from actually getting Karel to do what I wanted was exhilarating and far more rewarding than getting a pretty badge from Codecademy. I completed the course in about a month and am now learning Ruby, which I absolutely love.<p>My point is, people want to learn to program so they can build something, so starting off with concrete and fun projects (versus typing random stuff into a Terminal) is the way to go.",1326734296

I learned to read and speak and cook breakfast and ride a bike and program and everything else mainly by trying and failing.<p>(The bicycle is actually an interesting case, because we <i>try</i> to teach the happy-path with training wheels, though this essentially inverts the controls we're trying to learn.  It's a confidence-builder, not a skill-builder.)<p>Last year I took a class to learn a new skill.  The teacher was great: he was enthusiastic, and after each teaching point he got us to try it by saying ""Now let's go screw it up and learn!""  We spent a lot more time screwing it up than being lectured, thankfully.<p>I don't know much about ""Codecademy"", but based on this I would say it's not really going to help most people, but not because of these minor usability gripes.  The goal shouldn't be to create an 'intuitive tutorial'.  You're trying to teach people a new way of thinking.  The goal should be to provide an environment where the essence (type something, get result) is completely obvious, and where more information is always available upon request, and where they are encouraged to play around.  What I'm seeing is an environment where there's a right and a wrong.  It makes programming look like a 1980's MS-DOS adventure game but harder.",1326734107

It should be <i>spending less money on things</i>, not <i>spending more money on disposable things so you can technically say you don't own a lot</i>.",1326733238

Then they would attempt to identify the ringleaders and either fire them or harass them (to encourage them to quit). Is this a business tactic that you approve of?",1326733222

I'm personally in the 'I use Office in my day job and have some interest in the latest tech trends but no knowledge of how things work' segment.<p>Adding more expansive instructions should help as their current one/two-liner approach doesn't really explain anything for the absolute beginners. However, this can put some slightly more knowledgeable learners off by being too pedantic so Codecademy needs to find the right balance. Within their existing UI, they can probably do this via offering more 'Show Hints' per task like certain computer games where Hint 1 is the cryptic-ish hint, Hint 2 gives slightly more context and Hint 3 for really struggling learners. Users can then self-select how much help they need and don't feel like they are being spoonfed. If Codecademy is really targeting the absolute (but willing) beginners, they need to realise these users are unlikely to google for help as they are used to self-contained courses a la CBT courses in their day jobs.<p>Agree with imjared about the sweet badges - if they want to get the crowd (or maybe just me) going, they should start offering the options for users to buy some embroidered patches or 3D printed versions of the achievements!",1326733210

Your business model isn't proven, your product is likely conceptual, you're just going on the idea. Very high risk for a VC, so they'll want protection.<p>If we're talking about Series B or C, that's a whole different ballgame.",1326733200

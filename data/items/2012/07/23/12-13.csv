4280683,comment,4280315,4280315,1,0,mariusandra,,,"For me, the only thing missing in GIMP to be a viable competitor with Photoshop is support for layer styles.<p>I realize you can do almost all of the effects that Photoshop's layer styles offer, with some workarounds in GIMP, but it's not the same. The easiness of just ticking a few checkboxes, choosing either drop shadow or gradient overlay, playing with the parameters and seeing the result real time... plus then coming back to the dialog to tweak some parameters.... is so much better than the gimp way (applying a filter, clicking undo, writing down what you had  in the filter in case you need to rerun it with slightly different parameters, etc).<p>People without experience who wonder ""What's the big deal? You can do all the same things. Do you need some fancy interface to add bling-bling to your images?"" are missing the point. Making some of the more common operations as easy and as that saves a ton of time for example when creating web sites. For drop shadows in GIMP I have to move around two layers and re-run the filter if I need to change some parameters of the shadow. In Photoshop I just click the ""put a drop shadow on this layer"" checkbox. That's saving my time and letting me focus on what's essential.<p>Before GIMP gets support for these layer styles, it is, in essence, a fancy tool for cropping images. At least for me. Photoshop is used for the real work.<p>Plus, the plugins to convert Photoshop layers to CSS are additional time savers. For example CSS Hat: <a href=""http://csshat.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://csshat.com/</a> (I'm not affiliated).",1343048229

4280681,comment,4279961,4279961,31,0,nirvana,,,"Of all the government created monopolies, the cable monopolies are some of the worst.<p>If cable companies had to compete to keep business, they'd offer better service and treat their employees better. Southwest airlines is a good example of a company that has to keep costs low, but does this in part by treating their employees very well.<p>Notice that they charge ever higher and higher fees, in part because the municipalities are on the take here and get a cut of the fees, but also because the demand is inelastic.  If you live in Austin and you want cable, they have your business.<p>So, there's no reason to spend the money to have enough technicians to ensure they are able to do a good job and a timely one.<p>A big part of the reason this never improves is that everyone blames Time Warner.  TWC is just maximally allocating resources, which is what they should do. Namely, out of areas where they have a monopoly protected by the violence the city of austin will do to any other cable company that tries to compete.... and into areas where they have to compete for customers.<p>But you don't hear this issue at election time.  Why do people not hold their city council peeps accountable for imposing this overpriced monopoly on them?<p>My guess is that most don't realize it is a government created monopoly, and the ones who do, many think that there would be no cable if the city hadn't given those rights away as an incentive to install all the cable. (not the case... places where this doesn't happen, still get cable because it isn't that expensive to put in the cable.)",1343048179

Shouldn't they just remove that option entirely to streamline their flow, and ditch the ultra-rare customer who demands that? Sure, every customer wants a perfect experience super customized to their exact situation, but that's not how you run a business. Some of the biggest successes like Apple and McDonalds just pick some reasonable defaults, options, and cost per user levels and then that is that, no super advanced configuration, and the savings are huge. Just the lack of many different hardware configurations does wonders for Apple's software not running into problems and wonders for the hardware ordering cost savings (for the business).",1343048125

For DNS management, the Linode interface is fine if you have a handful of domains with simple configurations, but beyond that it's unwieldy IMHO.<p>I'd say the main reason to use a DNS hosting service is to consolidate your DNS management for all of your domains regardless of registrars or server hosting providers.  E.g., I personally have domains registered with 5 registrars and use two server providers.  And because they specialize in DNS, DNS hosting providers should have superior interfaces, APIs and support for DNS hosting compared to generalist hosting providers.<p>The SlickDNS interface has two features in particular that I haven't seen in any other DNS hosting service: automatic management of ""alias domains"" and mapping IP addresses to named servers.

Working backward from the numbers on solarbuzz that would mean that a residential scale system's price has dropped 25%.<p>And by cherry picking the prices for a residential scale installation (28.9 / 63.1 cents per kwh) he ignores the fact that industrial scale systems are much closer to parity.  The price for these systems is half of that 15.15 / 33.3. And these numbers have been declining.

4280587,comment,4279905,4279905,37,0,nirvana,,,"Having worked for Microsoft and Amazon, there is a reason that so many engineers go to work for Microsoft, or Google, after working at Amazon for awhile. It isn't just that they offer better benefits than Amazon.<p>I do not think this program will compensate for everything else when it comes to associates.  Associates are not respected by management.<p>Frankly, this is because Amazon does not respect employees. Full Stop.  (or suppliers, or anyone really.  They only treat customers well because it is profitable.  It is kinda funny that Zappos got bought by them, since Tony's ideology is the polar opposites of Bezos, but maybe Tony is just propagandizing the way Bezos makes himself out to be a visionary.)<p>Amazon is like the cult of scientology: It sounds really great on the way in, but well before you get to the verbal abuse, the death marches, denial of sleep and the beatings[1] you realize it was all a lie.<p>They do roll out the red carpet treatment in the early days for people that a manager insists need it.<p>But they operate on stack ranking, are completely political, anti-innovation, and really they are very much like a cult, with their own reality distortion field and magical sayings. ""Its day one!""<p>For contrast: Over the 25 years of my professional career, I have worked for a lot of startups. Many of them were poorly run, simply because the management was in well over their heads. There's a huge difference between management being well intentioned and over their heads and what I experienced at Amazon. Management at amazon is pathological, because Amazon is designed as a Lord of The Flies experiment, not a company.<p>I've also worked for Microsoft and a number of other big companies. Big companies have Big company suckage syndrome, and Microsoft has management problems. But again it is sorta like management ends up being a bit incompetent in areas where they shouldn't, not evil. Microsoft was also a little bit of a cult but a pretty mild one. Both companies practice the ""once you've turned your back on the cult you're unclean"" police though.<p>One important lie: ""If you don't like where you are at amazon, you can move to another department."" Despite getting an offer from the cutting edge part of AWS, my manager naturally blocked it because he was losing too many people (%60 of the team left by the time I left, because he was a total abusive asshole who knew nothing about computers, let a lone programming.) So, I resigned. (This was also after I'd tried to resolve the issue by going to HR, only to discover that HR told my manager everything I said, despite offering confidence, and thus he knew I wasn't going to lie to cover up his misdeeds.)<p>Just FYI, my manager at Amazon was a drug dealer who dealt to other amazon employees in the parking garage next to PacWest. He's had a wonderful career there because his boss is also incompetent, and the incompetence goes all the way to the top, and he's really effective at blaming others for his problems (like, you know, being a drug addict and forgetting to tell his team to do stuff.)<p>Incompetence is irritating. But that said, I had great experiences at a lot of companies, and at least perfectly fine ones at almost all the places I worked. I don't particularly like Microsoft, really, but I would never warn someone off working there.<p>Amazon is the only place I've ever taken the time to warn people against. Some people work there and do fine because they end up working for a manager who knows what a loop is. There are even largish groups like that (namely AWS). But that doesn't change the fact that there are whole divisions run by asshole bozos as well.<p>Amazon's crime is not in hiring an asshole bozo and putting him in charge of programmers. It is in letting him drive out %60 of his team and then promoting him. It is the culture that lets such a terrible person thrive. That culture is what makes Amazon a terrible place to work, because it is completely up to chance whether you will be treated decently or not.<p>[1] I wasn't beaten.  If I had been, I would have sued. Everything else is an accurate description of the experience.",1343046703

4280524,comment,4279490,4279490,1,0,lotides,,,"I guess I'll be the voice of opposition here. Unlike a lot of you, I live in Georgia and own guns. My family, friends and co-workers also own guns.<p>I currently only own a small 9mm handgun. I'm licensed to carry it concealed on me and do frequently. To get that license, I had to have a clean record, be signed off by a judge and have my fingerprints filed with the GBI and FBI from the local sheriffs office. I've been vetted similarly to what any police officer has gone through.<p>In the past I've owned a Bushmaster XM-15 E2S, a so-called AR-15 style ""assault weapon"" probably very similar to what was used in the shootings. I know a lot about weapons and the AR-15 platform in particular. To non gun owners, they do look like scary black military rifles but they're only semi-automatic (one round each time you pull the trigger) and are classified as ""varmint"" guns for civilians. That means it's illegal to hunt large game (like deer) with them a lot of places because they don't have the stopping power. The reason our military uses the same round (5.56 NATO/.223 civilian) is because they decided it was easier to give our troops a small round they can carry more of than train them all to be proficient marksmen.<p>To be truthful, your average deer hunting rifle has a lot more stopping power than an AR-15 and a skilled shooter can fire even a bolt-action rather rapidly. It's a misconception that the AR-15 platform is any more deadly just because of its appearance.<p>When politicians have tried to ban the AR-15 platform, they did it by picking out features at random and trying to regulate any weapon with those features. It's kind of a mess. For some reason they chose things like the handguard to pick on, which keeps that barrel from burning your hand after its been fired and the retractible stock which does nothing but allow you to adjust the rifle to be more comfortable for different shooters body types. It's about what you would expect when someone tries to regulate something they've made no attempt to understand.<p>I can argue about gun from a million different angles but it comes down to these things for me:<p> Every living thing on this planet has some form of defense. We as humans use tools. I don't see how you can possibly consider it smart to take away our only method of defense without providing an adequate alternative. The last time we called the police it took over 5 minutes for them to arrive and they aren't responsible for protecting individuals (Warren v. District of Columbia). That means you are responsible for yourself.<p> Criminals will always be able to access the things we ""ban"" (see: drugs, prostitution, et. al.) so any laws would only have an effect of disarming law-abiding citizens.<p> It's too late. We have as many guns in the U.S. as people. It would cost billions in law-enforcement work to even collect a fraction of those. It would also probably lead to a number of unnecessary violent encounters.<p> It's treating the symptom. Humanity will always have violence but if you really want to reduce these incidents we would work on the cause. We don't know a lot about the most recent incident yet but we do have huge issues with access to mental healthcare (and healthcare in general) in this country. We also have large problems with poverty and cultural issues.",1343045019

This creates two performance differences to images.<p>Firstly, the user will download the image data even if it isn't used on the page, an external image is only downloaded if it's element is present & visible.<p>Secondly & more importantly, browsers completely block rendering while CSS downloads (with the exception of Opera, which unblocks after about 3 seconds), CSS does not render progressively. A 10k CSS file with 60k of imagery will load slower than a 70k CSS file due to HTTP overhead, although it'll be perceived faster as the user sees things happening after 10k rather than looking at a blank screen until the full 70k has downloaded. Small numbers, but noticeable on flakey wi-fi and mobile connections.<p>In terms of image size, when you base64 encode an image you're using 8 bits of data to represent 6. Gzip deals with a lot of this, but it's still an extra ~10% per image. That's compared to separate images, with a sprite image you get further benefits by sharing a PNG palette and compression across all sprites.<p>Neither sprites or data uris are the ""correct solution"" in all situations, it should be considered on a case by case basis. Sprite Cow itself uses both techniques, the toolbar icons are in a sprite, some smaller tiling assets are data uris.",1343044863

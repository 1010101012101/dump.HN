You still have to worry about your systems, as Heroku has its own outages, not to mention the other pieces of your infrastructure like DBs, queues, etc.<p>2. Architecture flexibility goes way down, as vertical scaling isn&#x27;t a real option on Heroku (and a surprising number of problems can be easily solved in the short term by just throwing big iron at them).<p>3. The premium you pay on the hardware you&#x27;re using starts to add up, especially when you&#x27;re in the realm of &quot;let&#x27;s solve this problem in the short term by throwing machines at it.&quot;<p>Of course, that&#x27;s not to say you can&#x27;t use a hybrid approach of, say AWS + Heroku to solve some of these, but it&#x27;s a bigger hurdle to clear if you&#x27;ve outsourced all your systems work to Heroku from the beginning.

Not only do we use it, but it’s also used by plenty of other companies pushing even bigger scale. MySQL supports our need for ordering data requests, selecting certain ranges of data and row-level transactions. It has a hell of a lot more features, but we don’t need or use them. But, MySQL is a single box solution, hence the need to shard our data.

Material design is intended for Android native apps isn&#x27;t it?<p>Material Design aims to be a design language for any form factor, including the desktop. Some Google properties on the web have already started moving to a more &#x27;material-esque&#x27; design, like Photos or Drive. The reasoning is that some metaphors can be borrowed so there is a much familiarity as possible when discovering the same app on another form factor.
Material is not supposed to be uniquely Google branded but Google might have dropped the ball here when they decided to use it on their iOS apps as well. Their justification is that most many material elements have been used in iOS apps before,which is true, but they might have wanted to find a middle point instead (use the parts of material that feel native to iOS, ditch the rest).",1440021093

     allow for a more compact and logical structure to be presented to the api.
  * Built in support for compaction
  * Built-in versioning

Cons:<p><pre><code>  * couchdb versioning may not align with our notion of versioning
  * Requires a lot of space
  * Views instead of arbitrary queries
  * Performance not so predictable. (see how reads trigger version logic) (Colleague has had experience with this problem)

10088680,comment,10087484,10087484,0,0,coldtea,,,"Someone said in the comments that “the voices that cried the loudest about this were people at the top of the food chain”.<p>In reality I think those were just the voices that were heard more. Because obviously being at the top of the food chain gives them more visibility. Plenty of small-scale artists cried too, but nobody heard them or cared for.<p>Regardless of what people NOT in the music business will say, the thing, from all I’ve been able to gather, goes like this:<p>1) Album sales ―which before mp3s used to be a decent way for a small scale independent artist to make a living (shifting even 50.000 units was enough to live on as an independent artist in the eighties and early nineties)― have dried up.<p>Top acts sell this myth in their interviews that if you weren’t in the charts, or you barely made spot number 46 for example you might as well not exist. That, in IT terms, is like saying that 37 Signals is not a “real company” and only Google and Facebook are. Just because they were used to limos and champagne release parties doesn’t mean the thousands of artists outside top-100 didn’t make a living and create their art.<p>So, yeah, there WAS a huge, booming scene outside the “Billboard Top 100” (not to mention the UK and regional European scenes, and obviously elsewhere in the developed world), and those musicians could make a decent living too.<p>Mp3 and streaming have killed that for the most part (the “decent living”, not the scene part).<p>1.2) A small aside regarding this:<p>You’ll hear musicians tell horror stories about how the company took all their profits, and even charged them for recording costs, held their advance etc (e.g. the classic rant by Steve Albini). That was something that mostly happened to first-time stars and star-struck kids.<p>Musicians with some experience in the game, independent lower-volume selling acts etc, could always go to an independent label, have better contracts and a personal experience, etc. And of course those independent musicians also didn’t need 1.5 year in the studio to make an album, blowing most of their time (and advance money) on hookers and coke.<p>2) In the early days of mp3 (and still today) you heard people saying “piracy hasn’t harmed album sales, I buy more music now, since I can hear more stuff before I decide what to buy” etc.<p>Those people were either outliers or telling BS — the declining numbers of both CD and digital sales all this time disprove their claims.<p>3) There’s another suggestion often heard to “make money from playing live”.<p>First, for smaller bands (that weren’t the Rolling Stones or the Grateful Dead), live shows were a loss leader for album sales — and it’s not much better now. In fact, in most of the world, people — when adjusted for growing up — go to fewer live shows that they used to.<p>Second, while this might work for some, it’s a very american thing to assume that musicians exist to “play live”. In Europe there were lots of electronic musicians (not DJ/EDM style) having decent album sales that never cared for playing live.<p>There’s also the issue that a musician with 30.000 fans buying their albums around the world, might not have the required number of fans in any single town (apart from his hometown or some mega-city like NY) to hold concerts. And with the 30.000 fans becoming 2.000 people still buying his CD (and 28.000 just downloading it of somewhere) the artist is now screwed.<p>Then there’s the inane “sell merchandise” “solution”, as if a musician is just some merchant, and if one thing (selling music) doesn’t work, he’ll just pivot to selling some other stuff.<p>Not to mention that all those ideas are based on very US-centric perception, where all music that matters contains guitars and plays live, and all musicians are selling to 13 to 25 year old kids (because those are the primarily buyers of BS band merchandise — not 40 or 50 year old jazz, blues, electronica etc fans).<p>4) Streaming just made all of this worse.<p>5) I’m not saying we can go back in time. Or that we have some duty to provide musicians with a living if their business model doesn’t work.<p>I’m Just stating this, to recap: independent musicians that used to do well income-wise in the album days, are fucked up in the digital/streaming/piracy days.<p>That doesn’t stop them making music (especially since you can now create something from your home studio that used to take thousands upon thousands in studio time and you can release on your own on the internet), but it does stop them making a career in music, in the way musicians in the 70s, 80s and 90s used to.",1440020172

Improvements to human behaviours is notoriously hard, expensive, and time-consuming to replicate.<p>- We can rewrite many of our wealth creation recipes to make use of more specialised robots instead of flexible humans, which means robots won&#x27;t need to get close to general AI before this has significant effects on jobs.<p>- We are starting to see robots perform the most sophisticated human skills: visual recognition, acting on and producing language, and decision making under uncertainty. Granted, robots don&#x27;t do most of these things very well yet compared with humans, but I don&#x27;t see fundamental reasons for why the development will stop short of human abilities.<p>- Robots can work 24/7, won&#x27;t go on vacation, won&#x27;t quit on you, don&#x27;t play political games with the other robots, won&#x27;t sue you, don&#x27;t require food and bathrooms, and they&#x27;ll make fewer mistakes.<p>- If you&#x27;re mostly questioning the timing, I don&#x27;t have a particularly good answer, but given how I understand the state of things I believe we&#x27;re talking low single-digit decades rather than centuries for a significant proportion of people to look around and not find a job they could do better than a robot for a liveable wage (without government subsidies).

One example: Millikan measured the charge on an electron by an experiment with falling oil drops, and got an answer which we now know not to be quite right. It&#x27;s a little bit off because he had the incorrect value for the viscosity of air. It&#x27;s interesting to look at the history of measurements of the charge of an electron, after Millikan. If you plot them as a function of time, you find that one is a little bit bigger than Millikan&#x27;s, and the next one&#x27;s a little bit bigger than that, and the next one&#x27;s a little bit bigger than that, until finally they settle down to a number which is higher.<p>> Why didn&#x27;t they discover the new number was higher right away? It&#x27;s a thing that scientists are ashamed of—this history—because it&#x27;s apparent that people did things like this: When they got a number that was too high above Millikan&#x27;s, they thought something must be wrong—and they would look for and find a reason why something might be wrong. When they got a number close to Millikan&#x27;s value they didn&#x27;t look so hard. And so they eliminated the numbers that were too far off, and did other things like that...<p>[from &quot;Surely You&#x27;re Joking, Mr. Feynman!&quot; via Wikipedia–I know this isn&#x27;t exactly what you were talking about in your comment, but I thought it makes for an interesting discussion regardless]<p>Interesting paper on this here: <a href=""http://arxiv.org/pdf/physics/0508199v1.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/pdf/physics/0508199v1.pdf</a> and also another example here with the Hubble constant here: <a href=""http://www.pnas.org/content/101/1/8/F2.expansion.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pnas.org/content/101/1/8/F2.expansion.html</a><p>Even in Mullikan&#x27;s case, the paper I linked seems to suggest he <i>might</i> have intentionally omitted data that didn&#x27;t fit his narrative (I only know what I&#x27;ve read in that paper, so I wouldn&#x27;t like to make any stronger claims than that). Whether he was &#x27;right&#x27; to do that is an interesting question. Clearly the oil drop experiment was ground-breaking, and the results hugely important, but omitting inconvenient results is clearly a huge ethical violation. However, his intuition was correct, and he was observing a real effect, and the measurements he kept were good. So who can say? Science seems to be about asking the right questions as much as finding the right answers. Sometimes good science is just to get smart people talking about the &quot;right&quot; things, and the correct answers come later.<p>Perhaps peripheral, but another favourite example of mine is the Lennard-Jones potential for modelling e.g. noble gases. It has an attractive term and a repulsive term. The attractive term is distance to the power 6 and based on good physical reasoning; the repulsive term is distance to the power 12 and entirely arbitrary, just because it was easier to calculate since you&#x27;d already calculated the power 6 term. So, in a sense, it was completely made up. But it was still a useful tool because it helped people start asking the right questions, and exploring these systems, even if it was, in a sense, <i>wrong.</i>",1440018903
10088551,comment,10085698,10085698,0,0,joaorico,,,"I like this summary of the evidence that most published research is false[1]:<p>-&quot;One of the hottest topics in science has two main conclusions:<p><pre><code>  Most published research is false

  There is a reproducibility crisis in science
</code></pre>
The first claim is often stated in a slightly different way: that most results of scientific experiments do not replicate.&quot;<p>- [Ioannidis&#x27;] &quot;Paper: Why most published research findings are false.<p><pre><code>  Main idea: People use hypothesis testing to determine if specific scientific discoveries are significant. This significance calculation is used as a screening mechanism in the scientific literature. Under assumptions about the way people perform these tests and report them it is possible to construct a universe where most published findings are false positive results.

  Important drawback: The paper contains no real data, it is purely based on conjecture and simulation.&quot;
</code></pre>
- then it summarises in the same way 7 other papers, including the Many Labs results.<p>-&quot;I do think that the reviewed papers are important contributions because they draw attention to real concerns about the modern scientific process. Namely<p><pre><code>  We need more statistical literacy
  We need more computational literacy
  We need to require code be published
  We need mechanisms of peer review that deal with code
  We need a culture that doesn&#x27;t use reproducibility as a weapon
  We need increased transparency in review and evaluation of papers&quot;
</code></pre>
- the final paragraph:<p>&quot;The Many Labs results suggest that the hype about the failures of science are, at the very least, premature. I think an equally important idea is that science has pretty much always worked with some number of false positive and irreplicable studies. This was beautifully described by Jared Horvath in this blog post from the Economist.  I think the take home message is that regardless of the rate of false discoveries, the scientific process has led to amazing and life-altering discoveries.&quot;<p>[1] <a href=""http://simplystatistics.org/2013/12/16/a-summary-of-the-evidence-that-most-published-research-is-false/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://simplystatistics.org/2013/12/16/a-summary-of-the-evid...</a>",1440018876

It started with AWS support (and which I still use, but which is hard to buy from JungleDisk these days) and there originally were hints when they first added Rackspace support that they might continue to support arbitrary cloud storage backends and yet that never materialized. JD has nice sync engine and a good &quot;shared source&quot; deduped backup &quot;vault&quot; format. I just wish that JD would either Open Source their software or get back around to supporting more cloud backends. I get that Rackspace wants to focus on their own offerings, but I&#x27;d love to see the JungleDisk client get more capable, again.",1440018326

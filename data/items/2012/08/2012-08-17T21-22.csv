I think giving overwhelming weight to high karma old-timers would make HN more like them, which would be an improvement, right?<p>2. What about assigning karma not by your comments, but by the responses to them?<p>I figure karma-from-replies would shift the conversation to ""what should we be asking about this"", whereas karma-from-comments incents ""what can i say that the masses will like"".<p>Given commenting has a higher work threshold than voting, it might be ""manipulated"" less.  Gaming it would be more obvious.  And subjectively, posts that are questions seem to lead to higher quality discussion (more genuine?).

4398978,comment,4397498,4397498,2,0,ilaksh,,,">If you can lay out all the major screens and the design then thats worth its weight in gold. Design is also just about as hard to find as programming.<p>I am going to put myself out there by honestly saying that, as a programmer, I have never understood why people believe the above statement, and I disagree.  Please don't take this as a negative comment (I know people will, which is why most people would not write a comment like this).  I am just trying to understand.<p>I'm sorry, but I don't believe its worth its weight in gold.  Here is the starting point for my perspective:<p>1. An analyst, customer, boss, or someone who is not a programmer, describes in words what they want the software to do.  I take that description and spend a couple of days building a prototype web application.  I don't create the screens in Photoshop first because A) it will take longer and B) I'm not trying to create the ultimate user experience, I am trying to build functional software that we can start getting feedback and iterating on.<p>2. Analyst, customer, boss, designer, or someone who is not a programmer, looks at the prototype, may or may not acknowledge that the software now has the primary functionality requested, and starts criticizing the appearance or user experience.  Its actually easy for him to find flaws: its not very attractive (there was no time invested in making it attractive) and some use cases could involve fewer clicks.<p>2A. Here is the issue I have: it really seems to me that a significant portion of people believe at that point that the programmer was unable to conceive of an attractive design or shortcuts that would improve the user experience, and that is the context and justification for the entire field of design.<p>Anyway here is my experience: if you can't code, then you probably cannot actually create a better user experience than me.  If I am given time to work on a design, then I will optimize the user experience as much as possible given the features of the software platform and budget.  If there really aren't budget or time constraints then I can disregard the inner workings of the platform to some degree because I know I will have time to code whatever interface I can conceive of.<p>Maybe some designers can help me understand.",1345240087

Although I haven't been member that long, I've been lurking much longer, for a while I was afraid to really comment on any story as the attitude of some of the users on this site is to put it bluntly: elitist. It's these kinds of attitudes that causes arguments and the deterioration of a community. I rarely see people posting up new startups or web ideas they've come up with out of fear of ridicule any more.<p>To be honest I can come across as a cynical jerk, but unlike a lot of the people I see chastising other people in the comments, I'm at times cynical but never intentionally rude. There is a big difference between cynical and just plain rude. Pick any story on the homepage at any given time and people are nitpicking at peoples grammar and arguing something isn't right instead of contributing to the discussion.<p>Case in point all of this recent discussion about App.net. There appear to be two sides of the fence, one of those sides is hopeful that App.net will be successful and wishing Dalton Caldwell the best and the other side are making assumptions that it's going to fail and that people won't pay to use it, blah blah blah. This is the exact attitude the poster is talking about and I think all of the App.net submissions and comments are a great example of this ridiculous behaviour.<p>Etiquette aside, don't get me started on the submission quality. It feels like the homepage of HN is part interesting and beneficial submissions and the other half is comprised of articles; ""Hating on X programming language"", a blog post written by a Svbtle author (mostly Dustin Curtis), a Daring Fireball blog post, TechCrunch news article or submission of a Github repository for something built on-top of a programming language that I don't even know.",1345240071

In my relatively short time here, I've seen comments by certain top contributors being argued viciously(is that the word, English is not my first language sorry). People made good points and even attacked the top commenters points, quite a lot of which I felt was valid. Now on a purely egotistical basis if he/she wanted to superdownvote the entire thread nobody could possibly do anything to prevent it. Basically what I'm saying is that even they are humans.<p>I'd rather have a system where instead of simple up/down vote you have an elaborate system of 'Offtopic', 'Poor taste', 'Incorrect' as mentioned in a comment somewhere above. But also, I'd like to add positive halfs of these such as 'Insightful', and maybe one or two other labels. The idea being that they can select only one out of the total, and each label should secretly have different values. So maybe flagging a comment as Incorrect isn't as penalizing as putting one as Off-topic or Poor taste. Insightful may have different positive value as compared to maybe something labelled as 'Excellent advice' or something.<p>With a lot of options, I don't think newbies would actually click randomly on any button without knowing the meaning and context of each button.

I have no trouble keeping all 20+ source files of a project open at once, each with its own spacial position I can quickly return to. It's easy to expand a buffer just a little bit so I can look at function prototypes in a .h file while coding in another window. If I want to open another file, I just right-click it in the directory listing.<p>The command language is powerful enough to do what I want day-to-day. It's easy to apply an editor command across every open buffer, if you need to refactor for instance. Like emacs, you can write applications which run in Acme; we have a mail client, news reader, CD player, and IRC client (among others).<p>When it comes time to compile, I can execute a ""mk"" command from within Acme by simply typing ""mk"" anywhere and executing it with the middle mouse button--this isn't just for mk, you can do that with any command. It'll put the output in a new buffer, and if there are compilation errors, you just right-click on the filename:line-number (foo.c:42) and Acme instantly jumps you to that line of the file.<p>There are more cool things about Acme, but I can't sit here and type all day! It's basically what you get when you take the Unix concept ""It's all just text"" and make an editor out of it: text is content, text acts as commands, text is for searching.",1345239300

4398893,comment,4397390,4398234,4,0,jff,,,"There have been some great answers from others in this thread already. Here's my take on things:<p>1. As others pointed out, Plan 9 was not initially free. If you go back and look at the very oldest messages from the 9fans mailing list (<a href=""http://9fans.net/archive/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://9fans.net/archive/</a>, starts in 1993) you'll see lots of messages from people just trying to figure out how to get a license. At the same time, you could get Linux for free or very cheap.<p>2. Plan 9 is unfamiliar for new users. Face it: most people define ""intuitive"", ""powerful"", and ""useful"" as ""that thing I'm already used to"". Programming in Plan 9 is pretty similar to programming Unix, and the shell feels much the same, but you still need to learn new concepts and people don't like that.<p>3. Plan 9 is not Unix. People have, from the beginning, wanted to reshape Plan 9 in the image of the Unix/Linux environments they are familiar with, even when it doesn't make sense. They want Emacs or Vim, without having even tried Acme or sam. They want bash, ssh, X11, Firefox, and GNOME. Some of this software, like ssh, X11, and even Vim, have been ported or re-implemented because they're useful for interoperability with Unix or simply because somebody wanted it bad enough to do the port (Vim).<p>Those aren't the only reasons, but they're pretty substantial.<p>As for what the next kernel/OS should do, I'd say it's not enough to just exist and be good. You have to be used widely and have enough developers become familiar with it. If, for instance, some engineer at Facebook comes up with a nifty kernel <i>and</i> convinces them to start using it on all their servers, that kernel will probably be successful outside because there's suddenly a massive deployment of it.<p>Alternately, if you can get into a market that's less entrenched than the desktop, you may have a chance. We saw this to some extent with netbooks (some of the earliest ones shipped with Linux by default), we've definitely seen it with smartphones, and I have a feeling that we may see it in tablets. The problem with the desktop frequently comes down to: ""Why can't it run Firefox and open my Word documents?""",1345238670

So in that larger context I was working on this plan when working for a company that had a data center near the Columbia River and 'industry leading' PUE numbers.<p>Generally when the wind was blowing (and it blows a lot along the Columbia River Gorge) there is no need for additional cooling. When there is no air movement and the outside temperature is high, the demand for cooling increases requiring a more 'active' engagement (sorry but I can't be more specific than that).<p>So realistically I was looking to time shift the excess cooling capacity that was available during windy times to the times when there was little wind and excess heat. Compressing air has some advantages in that the amount of energy you can get out vs the amount you put in is comparatively efficient to battery power, and using / exploiting the cooling effect of the expanding air, and the kinetic energy of its expansion to generate electricity,  was actually more efficient than other methods. Maintenance burdens were also lower and municipal permitting was made easier by the lack of 'dangerous' chemicals or catalysts.<p>These advantages are perhaps uniquely suited to data centers. Of course I didn't get to actually build it because MDI wouldn't participate. That was too bad but certainly well within their rights.",1345238536

I agree, HN can be a lot less supportive and honest these days. When you share something you've created, the feedback can be brutal. Things have changed, you're right about that. The causes have been well-documented, whether in Paul Grahams comment, Giles Bowketts rant, or Joel Spolskys observations on building online communities with software.<p>I cant tell Hacker News what to do about its growth. Im not an expert by any means. And I cant really heal the hurt you must feel when you pour your heart and soul into creating something only to have people you care about say meh, or worse. Ive been there, and although I put a brave face on it, I hurt when people criticize things I take personally.<p>Its all very well and good to say, Dont take it personally. I dont take it personally when a client doesnt like a feature I suggest for them. Its a business, Im trying things for them, it isnt personal. But when I write essays or stories or share a little library of code, I am doing something very personal, and truth be told I crave some positive feedback, some signal that people are glad I tried even if it isnt for them.<p>What I wouldnt give for a few more Hey, great effort, it would have been even better if youd considered adding Foo comments and a lot fewer What good is it without Foo? questions.<p>So here I am sharing something about me, and this is very personal. I hope I am resonating with you, because if it helps you in any way, I can live with 1,000,000 downvotes from grumpy people.  And for me, that is one of the keys to being happy in a public forum. Seize on any bit of progress, no matter how small. If you like this letter, I can focus on that, I made you nod, or smile, or maybe feel a little better for a little while. That isnt a billion dollars from a startup, but it is damn satisfying to find out that someone, somewhere is a little bit happier for a time, and to think you helped.<p>And maybe you can find that from the things you are trying. Is there one person out there who is a little happier, who learned a little something, who is grateful for your work? That matters, and it matters more than ten or a hundred or a thousand nay-sayers. I can tell you flat out, I am grateful you wrote your message to Hacker News. It struck something in me. It is striking something in other people. It is making people think. It is making the world a teeny bit better. Thats something positive you did, some important measure of your worth. Thank you.<p>Maybe Hacker News will find a way back to where it came from. I dont know. But I can tell you, I decided a while back that I want to try to stick around even if it doesnt. I dont want to bail to the next little place the way I bailed from Reddit to HN. Time changes, and we must change with it. Unless it becomes actively poisonous, I want to try to grow and learn to be happy in spite of how it is not the way it was. There are still many wonderful things happening there, many wonderful people posting there, many excellent posts appearing there.<p>The trick for me at least is to learn how to filter out the crud without being upset. It is not easy, I think I have had trouble with negative feedback my whole life. But if there is one positive idea in a thread, isnt it worth sorting through and ignoring the dreck? And this is not a passive experiment, We can contribute the good ideas, we can lead by example. Im trying to be less argumentative. Im trying to be more thoughtful. Theres some value in that for myself. You may already be where Im trying to go, I dont know. But it seems worth trying. It seems worth sticking around and making a positive contribution. Who knows, you might make one person somewhere nod their head and think and be happy for a moment in time.<p>Thats a good thing, and I hope that whatever you do and wherever you go, you keep making things and saying things and trying to make the world a better place.<p>Sincerely,<p>Reginald Braithwaite.",1345238124

Hansen quotes Mr. Stabenow, who essentially suggests that child pornography laws are wrongly
concerned that the images goad the consumers to commit future crimes: People who watch
movies like Saw and Friday the 13th are being titillated by the act of torture and murder ... That
doesnt mean that theyre going to go out and commit torture and murder.  The analogy does
not hold water, principally because no one who watches Saw believes that the images of violence
are actually happening, where in child pornography images, real children are actually being
abused.  Furthermore, what is the point of any pornography if not to stoke the fires of sexual
desire.""",1345237295

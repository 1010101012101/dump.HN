I look at revenue, cash flow, and customer loyalty. Revenue for obvious reasons. Cash flow because it&#x27;s what they&#x27;re bringing in for real. Customer loyalty because it hints at what they can sustain and build on.<p>For sales people, it might be what they made in terms of compensation plan and customer loyalty in terms of what they can bring to the new company. One thing not mentioned in the article, but which I&#x27;ve witnessed, is that great sales people often bring their customers with them to a new company if they can. One recent example from people I know involved a guy who moved to a competitor with literally over a million in sales. He just fed his customers&#x27;s egos to get and keep their acquisitions then benefited when they sold their own companies on the change that mainly benefited him. Made a killing on this approach despite not even trying hard to get new customers lol. So, always worth remembering that this might happen if your product/service is interchangeable with others.",1443239649

There should be some sort of criteria where the effort required to invent something is taken into account. If it&#x27;s likely to come about merely as a result of playing in the space, then what does the public gain by issuing a patent?</i><p>One line of reasoning is that there are not enough people &quot;merely playing in some space&quot; to find more solutions to problems. This is not just theoretical. There is empirical evidence based on historical data that showed how the introduction of patent protection to previously ineligible arts influenced innovation. It finds there was more innovation in areas where previously protection was not available or where it was too easy for competitors to rip off your inventions. See <a href=""http://www.jstor.org/stable/4132712"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jstor.org/stable/4132712</a> for instance.<p><i>> If you patent can be constructed just by asking a simple question... </i><p>Many scientists, mathematicians and engineers will tell you that the best way to solve a difficult problem is by framing it correctly. Put another way, you have to first ask the right questions. The solution may become obvious then, but it may be very hard to first ask the <i>right</i> question. And hindsight is a very powerful bias. What may seem like a simple question today may not actually have been so before it was posed.<p>This is also one of the many problems with requiring effort as a criteria. Besides being difficult to quantify in general, how do you measure the effort required to formulate the right question? How do you quantify flashes of insight?

The value was equally due to the regulation <i>and</i> the fact that street hails are so convenient relative  to the other options. Just like property value is due equally do to the exclusive usage rights to it, and to utility of using the property itself (and I&#x27;d appreciate any feedback regarding how I can better communicate the dynamic in that analogy).<p>Therefore, it is well known that both a) regular property and b) medallions can lose value from either 1) governments not enforcing exclusivity or 2) legal alternatives becoming better. Governments never made any promise (either for property or medallions) that thy wouldn&#x27;t lose value from 2). (To extend the analogy further to the car dealership case, the manufacturer makes no promises about eg Chevy demand falling because public transit gets better.)<p>To be sure, it certainly does suck when you put all your net worth in one asset and it loses value, but it does not thereby follow that your rights were violated or that a promise was broken. Nor does it necessarily make sense for the government to spread out the losses from this, because, well, why stop there? Why not socialize the losses from tepid real estate markets for leveraged homeowners, or for leveraged investors in local industries when their foreign counterparts get better?<p>There isn&#x27;t a lot you can do about limiting investment downside risk beyond preventing people from having too much net worth in any one thing ... which maybe they should have done for medallions (or should start doing for homes, for that matter).",1443238711

What could be more obvious? How else would it work? . . .<p>>The Internet didn&#x27;t scale into an open, high-trust network of personal servers. It scaled into a low-trust network that we use as a better modem — to talk to walled-garden servers that are better AOLs. We wish it wasn&#x27;t this way. It is this way.<p>This is the problem Urbit aspires to solve: <i>Why does everything suck</i>? Why aren&#x27;t we living in the future we were promised in 1985, where everything is easy because all software plays nice together? Why do we have a planetary series of Rube Goldberg machines instead of the fun version of the Borg?<p>The answer is that we&#x27;ve been building everything on top of leaky abstraction, piling band-aids on top of band-aids instead of just starting with a stable foundation. Urbit&#x27;s solution is to replace every OS, file system, and communications protocol on Earth with a single application: Urbit.<p>The project is <i>meant</i> to be the biggest pain in the ass ever. It&#x27;s an attempt to fix everything that is wrong with computers by rebooting the entire information age.<p>The beauty is that it doesn&#x27;t all have to happen at once. Urbit can function like a kernel for all non-Urbit systems: They get to call Urbit to receive its super-reliable data, but it never makes system calls so they can&#x27;t inject side effects into the shiny new Urbit ecosystem. Over time, if Urbit works as intended, it will assimilate everything else.<p>Once you understand the stakes, Nock and Hoon no longer look like cruel jokes. It would be madness to expect coders to invest all that effort to learn &#x27;just another language.&#x27; It&#x27;s only pseudo-madness to make the same demands while promising that their code will still work a million years from now, because all computers will still be running Urbit.<p>Instead of caviling about details like how to pronounce the code when reading it aloud, let&#x27;s delve into the issues that really matter:<p>I. Does modern computing suffer from a leaky abstraction problem that needs to be solved?<p>II. If so, is the solution to build an overlay network that provides a global static functional namespace?<p>III. If so, is Urbit a viable implementation of that solution?<p>IV. If so, what is the likelihood of Urbit reaching the critical mass necessary for mass adoption?<p>The last question is the one that interests me the most. In order to overcome the massive inertia behind legacy computing, Urbit needs a killer app: Something that exploits the new system&#x27;s intrinsic advantages to accomplish feats that were previously impossible.<p>So... uh... Any suggestions?",1443237963

The H.323 vs SIP battle was fought a long time ago... for better or worse, SIP won. Any H.323 systems still in the wild can probably be considered &quot;legacy.&quot;<p>That being said, while H.323 has more &quot;batteries included,&quot; its call flow is accordingly more complex. SIP is not <i>too</i> bad, there is some subtlety to it, but the main issue is that you have to piece together dozens of RFCs for an interoperable system, not to speak of implementation-specific quirks.<p>XMPP is the more appropriate protocol in this context -- IM and group chat -- because it has had presence and ad-hoc messaging baked in from the start, including reasonably supported MUC. Ultimately, XMPP&#x27;s issues are similar to SIP&#x27;s -- the patchwork of XEPs is too unwieldy to work with. For an example, compare the multimedia bits (eg, Jingle) and the corresponding SIP session setup flow. The stigma of being a XML-based protocol designed in the 90&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t help, either.<p>The biggest reason SIP is sticking around, however, is that it has major buy-in from the telcos with IMS/4G. However, SIP is also a more appropriate protocol for traditional telephony. In that respect, comparing SIP and XMPP is a bit like comparing apples to oranges. With the appropriate extensions, one could behave like the other, but it wouldn&#x27;t be their strength.",1443237552

I&#x27;m not even sure what this feature is supposed to do?<p>As best I can gather, this ties signing to keybase.io (which is <i>anchored</i> in a GPG-key). But it&#x27;s unclear to me how this is an improvement for users. If you sign anything with a nacl sub-key, that can&#x27;t be verified with gpg? It&#x27;s not even clear if this will work off-line, when keybase is down, when keybase have revoked your account...?<p>> Technically, though, this is not a normal 2fa: the devices will share a secret with just each other.<p>This is <i>exactly</i> 2fa: two devices sharing a secret? Normally your idp and your TOTP app/token share a secret, now two of your devices share a secret?<p>I very much welcome someone hammering out a standard equivalent to GPG, but based on NaCL, that is: have a master key (off-line), have a private-sub-key (on-line, protected by smart card/pass phrase), enable further sub-keys -- and a companion tool (set) for verifying up the chain (like gpg2 --verify file.asc, but with file.asc being backed by a (device) sub-key, signed by the private key, signed by the &quot;master&quot; off-line key -- and allow for revoking &quot;from this key and down&quot; (eg: I lost my phone, revoke phone-key, my laptop got hacked, revoke my sub-key, and all device keys...)).<p>But I&#x27;m not sure if that is what keybase is trying to do?<p>I&#x27;m not even sure if it really makes sense to keep backwards comparability with GPG -- the main thing would probably be to be compatible with GPG agent and smartcards. For most everything else, I think a new standard would be a good thing. Perhaps with some kind of bridge, for easier transition (eg: nacl-gpg --verify file.asc, which gives similar output/return-codes to gpg, while file.asc can be signed by a &quot;nacl-key&quot; trusted by a gpg key. But the complexity would probably make for a less secure system until everyone could just move on to the new standard).",1443237471

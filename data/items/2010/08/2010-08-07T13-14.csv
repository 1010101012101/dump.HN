And if you do build something that was possible before, ie- Dropbox, then I suggest you use the building blocks to build an iteration that wasn't possible before.  Dropbox was started as a small project by Drew and eventually a YC funded company with a small 25k in capital.  It wouldn't have been possible to do Dropbox before AWS,etc. without spending a ton of up front Capex in hardware you may or may not use down the road.",1281189063

Reagan's NASA administrator (removed from his position before the Challenger disaster).

Assigning some police officers to admin work lowers their status, and in effect the status of your entire tribe.

But there are some: giving as a gift, getting signed by an author, the physical experience of having a real object, etc.<p>But electronic readers have a long way to go before they're useful for other types of books. A textbook or reference where you might constantly flip around the book would need better navigation or a way to use multiple synchronized displays to view a book.<p>Art / coffee table books need a better display and physical experience. In the future I can see something like a leather-cased super-sized iPad sitting on stuffy coffee tables, loaded with amazing visuals.<p>Kids books still need a cheaper, sturdier reader and color. Electronic readers can never replicate books with popups and textures, but the sound, video and interactivity they can offer could blow that away. I don't think electronic books can ever really replace coloring books for kids, but they should be able to replace workbooks.",1281187443

They are much more enjoyable to read.  Maybe it's just because I spend so much time on a computer, but it's nice to read something without a device attached.<p>A paper book is a real thing.  It's crafted.  E-books seem to have many more typos and bugs.  The only bugs in paper books are the kind with legs.  Paper books have a user interface that does exactly what you intend: turn the page, insert a bookmark, make a highlight if that's your thing.  With the kindle I always have to worry about if it thinks I mean what I think I mean when I press the back button.  E-books are based on software, and software's natural state is to suck.  I don't have to worry about my codices running out of power.<p>Also, devices are expensive.  I don't have to worry about most codices getting stolen if I take them out in public.  I have to be <i>careful</i> with my Kindle.  When we have cheap, disposable e-readers, paper books might be in danger, but until then I think they're fine.",1281187409

Or let other people support the lectures and answer upcomming questions.<p>I think that its a collosal waste of time and ressources to make great lecturers repeat the same lecture over and over and over again to a small, limited number of students, instead of letting them record a larger number of one-time lectures. My favourite example is Salman Khan. If he had to repeat a few chosen topics over and over, he would never had the chance of creating a body of work as large and comprehensive as his academy.<p>He said about that: ""With so little effort on my own part, I can empower an unlimited amount of people for all time. I can't imagine a better use of my time.""<p>By the way, in the recorded SICP lectures, there arent actually _that_ many interesting questions asked. If Abelson and Sussman thought your way and prefered live interaction just in order to be able to answer more questions, thousands of people during the last 25 years would have not been able to experience them _at all_. It is not fair to reduce great lecturers to mere question answerers, IMO the accompanying Q&A sessions always account for a very small part of the value of a lecture, i.e. just to fill a occasional gap.",1281187285

There are some idiosyncrasies here: &#x27;nil&#x27; is shorthand for the identity function (in this case, the two-argument, two-value identity function), and the use of keyword symbols is weird and potentially problematic, though I&#x27;ve never run into a problem with it in practice.<p>This is the map-reduce model of iteration -- obviously not with support for distributed computation, but nonetheless useful for programming in the small.

From time to time you need an upgraded something for some macros to be feasible.<p>E.g. it&#x27;s hard to &quot;macro your way&quot; into having first-class continuations, if they aren&#x27;t in the substrate.<p>That is to say, without the macro treating all of its arguments as a self-contained language.<p>You usually want the code which is in the macro forms to smoothly interoperate with outside code, such as make lexical references to surrounding bindings.<p>This is the fuzzy limit. Macros have to write stuff in some language, which is no longer macro-expandable. That language has to be reasonably expressive in its semantics for what the macros want to do.",1431042172

If you can&#x27;t interact and are given a fixed batch to learn from you can find trivial overfitted good predictive models (e.g. the identity model).<p>One way of reproducing this aspect of interactions is simply using standard ML techniques to prevent overfitting, such as cross validation.<p>There&#x27;s another aspect that&#x27;s more difficult to reproduce that is the &quot;online learning&quot; aspect of interactions.

In those cases we have to show that we can improve on those models.   We do that by discovering how some outcome of interest is spread (localized) in the data.   You can think of this as finding different local descriptions of a phenomena.  Many methods will fine the dominant description but miss more subtle variations - we find a more complete picture.<p>For example, if you&#x27;re looking at fraud (credit card, login etc) velocity-based measures may catch machine-assisted fraud but miss manual and more sophisticated fraud. Different kinds of fraud have different (local) descriptions.<p>From a data scientist workflow this means that you (1) select features. (2) create topological summaries.(3) find regions where fraud is localized (4) find underlying reasons why the fraud is being localized in these groups (5) use this information to build better models (exactly how you use this information is another long post).<p>It&#x27;s important to note that I didn&#x27;t have to think of the reasons for all of the different types of fraud ahead of time - the groupings and shape summary guide my feature search (to be fair this is usually an iterative process initial features --> shape localizations --> more/different features etc.).<p>I ansered a similar question as part of a kdnuggets interview.  I&#x27;ll excerpt it here:<p>Q3. What are the unique benefits of Topological Data Analysis (TDA) over other approaches?<p>Topology is the study and description of shape. In Big Data problems, shape arises because you have a notion of similarity or distance between data points. This can be something like Euclidean distance, correlations, a weighted graph distance or even something more esoteric. Shape is exploited in machine learning by bringing in some additional information such as “my data has well defined clusters or classes”; “this outcome is linear “; or “my signal is periodic”. Then you would use specialized tools to apply models based on this information.<p>Topology adds the ability to understand and describe the shape without imposing additional model information, which can be biased and misleading. This leads to a number of concrete benefits, such as predictive model improvement and a better understanding of your data.<p>This seems like a trivial point, but can be key to solving complex problems with a high degree of accuracy. A simple example of this comes from hospital predictive models. Hospitals want to measure how sick people are and collect a variety of clinical information (blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, breathing rate, oxygen levels etc.) or genetic information (gene expression levels). Typically, they fit a linear regression model that predicts how “sick” patients are. The underlying assumption is that there is a near linear relationship between symptoms and “sickness”.<p>One of Ayasdi’s academic collaborators took gene expression data for people at different stages of malaria. When examined using TDA, he found patients all lying on a circle sitting inside of a high dimensional space (~1000 features). While in retrospect the circle is obvious, your path from being healthy to sickness and back to healthy does not track up and down through the same set of symptoms, and yet nobody had thought to look for the circle.<p>Most real world data sets that I look at are larger and more complicated than this example and we find a variety of structures — cluster, flares, loops and higher dimensional structures — all appearing in a single data set. It is nearly impossible to guess or hypothesize the right structures ahead of time, and TDA is a tool to understand your data in an unbiased way, revealing its true complexity.<p>The complete interview is here:<p><a href=""http://www.ayasdi.com/blog/topology/kdnuggets-interview-anthony-bak-ayasdi-get-started-topology/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ayasdi.com/blog/topology/kdnuggets-interview-anth...</a>",1431041062

The parentheses are huge, though.  It enables &quot;Code is data&quot; and &quot;Data is code&quot; in a powerful way.<p>About Lisp, people always say &quot;Macros are great&quot; and &quot;Code is data&quot; and &quot;Data is code&quot;, but it&#x27;s hard to see what they mean without good examples.  I mean, you can write code that writes code in any language that has a `print` statement.  And <i>obviously</i> code is data, so what is that aside from some pseudo-philosophic BS?<p>There&#x27;s a lot of discussion in this thread about macros - so here&#x27;s an example of Code and Data Being One, for those that are unconvinced.  I hope it&#x27;ll shed some light.<p>I have a slang dictionary website.  It&#x27;s backed by a database now, but it used to be statically-generated HTML.  I represented the data as XML.  It looked something like this:<p><pre><code>    <Term term=&quot;slick&quot;>
      <PartOfSpeech pos=&quot;adj&quot;>
        <Definition>
          impressive.
        </Definition>
        <Definition>
          smart.
        </Definition>
      </PartOfSpeech>
    </Term>
</code></pre>
So then I needed an XML parser to parse the data.  Maybe it parsed the XML into a object model that the code would navigate and output the appropriate HTML.  Or maybe the code got callbacks according to node type and would output the appropriate HTML then.<p>XML is a pretty verbose format, so - this being a Lisp example - we could probably save some typing if we represented the data as an S-expression.  The above XML would become something like this:<p><pre><code>    (Term &quot;slick&quot;
      (PartOfSpeech &quot;adj&quot;
        (Definition
          &quot;impressive.&quot;
        )
        (Definition
          &quot;smart.&quot;
        )
      )
    )
</code></pre>
But that&#x27;s an idiosyncratic style.<p>So, let&#x27;s lowercase the node types, use hyphens rather than camelCase, and remove the unnecessary line breaks.  Now the data looks like this:<p><pre><code>    (term &quot;slick&quot;
      (part-of-speech &quot;adj&quot;
        (definition &quot;impressive.&quot;)
        (definition &quot;smart.&quot;)))
</code></pre>
Great.  We&#x27;ve got our data.<p>Now we need to write the Lisp code to convert that S-expression data into the appropriate HTML output.<p>We&#x27;ll need some Lisp functions to handle the nodes and their attributes (such as the definition text and part of speech) and write the HTML for them.  We could use an S-expression parser library to load the data, and then walk through it and call those functions.  But that&#x27;s not necessarily the best way.  We can simplify it by creating exactly 3 functions that take some arguments and output HTML: term, part-of-speech, and definition.<p>Since Lisp code is - like the data - also represented as S-expressions, once we&#x27;ve written those 3 functions, the data is literally executable Lisp code.",1431040480

But what I&#x27;m saying is that there are cases where it can legitimately not cause a bug.<p>The problem I have is this: this testing framework explicitly states the following:<p>> The quality of your tests can be gauged from the percentage of mutations killed<p>So, you write your tests to test that there is a consistent ordering, it changes the &quot;<&quot; to a &quot;>&quot;, finds that all tests still pass (because, as you said, you&#x27;re only testing if there is a consistent ordering, because that&#x27;s the only thing that matters in this case), and considers your tests lower-quality because of that.<p>This is a flaw most mutation testing - and, for that matter, test driven design - suffers.<p>For another flaw: there are many things that end up along the lines of a bunch of shortcut &quot;fast paths&quot; at the start, with a slow path at the end that does slow but exhaustive checking.<p>For example, if you&#x27;re checking that two objects are equal you may insert a check at the start to see if they are the same pointer, and if so return `true`. If you&#x27;re doing division in software you may check if you&#x27;re dividing by 1 instead of doing the computation. That sort of thing.<p>Any mutation that introduces false negatives into the shortcuts (but no false positives) won&#x27;t be flagged by mutation testing.",1431040424

For example, they can generate and manipulate declarations.  Say you&#x27;re working with abstract syntax trees (assembly trees in a CAD app might be another example).  These trees are built from nodes, where each node is of some class corresponding to a syntactic construct: if-statement, addition-expression, etc. etc.  There&#x27;s some functionality you want to have on every node class; a common example is a &quot;children&quot; method that gathers up all the node&#x27;s child slots into a set and returns it.  It is very convenient to have a &#x27;define-node-class&#x27; macro that automatically generates the &#x27;children&#x27; method, so that when you add a child slot, the method is updated automatically; there&#x27;s no need for manual effort to keep them in sync.<p>In this case, the macro is expanding to multiple top-level declarations: the class declaration along with the method declaration (probably, in practice, several methods).  Higher-order functions don&#x27;t begin to let you do stuff like this.",1431040380

Frondo said, &quot;The X doesn&#x27;t do Y, which is why they are still X.&quot; You say/interpret Frondo as saying, &quot;The X doesn&#x27;t do Y <i>because</i> they are X.&quot;<p>What&#x27;s the difference? Assume that a group of people have an expected group of behaviors. If they had a different set of behaviors, they could remove themselves from the group. But if they don&#x27;t have those other behaviors, they aren&#x27;t able to remove themselves from the group. Are they in the group because they are in the group (as you have been saying Frondo has been saying)? Or are they in the group because they don&#x27;t have a set of behaviors to remove themselves from the group (as I interpret Frondo as saying)?<p>In the context of poverty in the US, there are countless structural, cultural, behavioral, and just daily life practicalities of why rising above poverty is <i>very</i> difficult. While I don&#x27;t agree that the lack of political motivation and clout are <i>the</i> only or primary reasons for continued poverty, I do agree they are substantial contributing factors.",1431039676

9508973,comment,9506668,9508468,0,0,xnull6guest,,,"The problem is when there are confluences of conditions that systemically prevent someone (or their &#x27;class&#x27;) from having the mobility to exit their condition, even when they have enough merit to otherwise warrant it.<p>Take for example indentured servitude, or third world sweat shops. Sure, working for $0.28 a day in a (dangerous, unsanitary) factory is better than subsistence farming. But if this opportunity is enough to feed a family but not enough to lift the family from a condition whereby it can exit from needing to work in the factory, how is this so very different from perpetuated servitude?<p>Take serfs. While serfs were &#x27;bound to the land&#x27;, the condition of the serf was voluntary and mutually beneficial: Wikipedia reads &quot;Serfs who occupied a plot of land were required to work for the Lord of the Manor who owned that land, and in return were entitled to protection, justice and the right to exploit certain fields within the manor to maintain their own subsistence.&quot;<p>Certainly it was a better deal for the serf to labor underneath a lord than live in the wild - especially since all fertile lands had already been captured by lords. And indeed, you see the language and argumentation during the time period repeat a variant of your argument: both the serf and the lord benefit from the situation and therefore it is good. Similarly, whites made similar arguments about black slavery throughout the history of American slave trade.<p>But a situation where both parties have no benefit by changing their &#x27;local&#x27; stratety by small amounts represents a local Nash-like equilibria at the best - and not anything one could argue is a &#x27;global&#x27; optimum. And in fact, if one truly buys that markets are meritocratic, one should be willing to subsidize the equality of opportunity so that as many people start off on an even footing as possible.<p>In sum this is to say that, like Braess&#x27;s Paradox, locally rational decisions lead to local but not global maxima - whose gaps can be seen to be gigantic from history. When we discuss opportunities for labor, wealth and quality of life, this becomes an ethics question.<p>It is not so clear, at least to me, that the principle of trade (especially given its other major problems not covered here) should be prioritized over ethical considerations. Quandaries like this do lead us to ask what sorts of wages and opportunities are &#x27;fair&#x27;.",1431039640

9508970,comment,9508022,9508920,0,0,munificent,,,"> why do you specify a version range, and not just always specify a precise version?<p>To handle shared constraints.<p>Let&#x27;s say myapp uses foo and bar, which both use shared_thing. To solve this, we need to pick a single version of shared_thing that both foo and bar work with. If foo and bar have narrow-to-the-point-of-precise constraints like shared_thing 1.2.3+bug-fix, then it&#x27;s very likely that no version of shared_thing makes both foo and bar happy. The end result is no solution.<p>To accommodate that, packages are strongly encouraged to semantically version themselves. Then, when you depend on a package, you use as wide a range as you can. If foo wants shared_thing &quot;>=1.2.3 <2.0.0&quot; and bar wants &quot;>=1.3.0 <2.0.0&quot; then the solver can pick, say, 1.5.3, and both are happy.",1431039608

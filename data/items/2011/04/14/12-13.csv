Now the grooviest platform is built by many indie lib coders, the majority of whom open source.

I guess it's different for bigger/other projects, although the dozens of mailing lists I've been on over the years haven't shown many differences.<p>""but secondly if you contribute it upstream your patch becomes someone else's problem""<p>This, too, is vastly overstated. I have contributed dozens of patches over the years that were just left in bug trackers or tracs, or were ignored on mailing lists - sometimes because nobody cares, sometimes because people just like to hack on their own use cases instead of somebody else's problems, sometimes because its against the (usually unstated) 'philosophy' of the software.<p>Not to be negative, there are many useful open source projects, and I use many. But they're usually run by one or a few highly committed people.<p>I too have a bunch of projects in local repositories - I don't see any reason to open them up. A bunch of projects out there with no activity for 3 years looks quite bad too - once you start advertising your public repos, you have to keep up on them. The trade off is usually not worth it for me (for new projects, that is - I keep the ones I've worked on in the past on the web).",1302785611

We watched the gears turning and stopping to add up numbers, saw the complex mechanisms to handle carrying digits, and she asked me how this would work if it was binary and I just said ""much more simply"". Then she admitted that, even though she has been working as a developer and manager of developers for years, she never learned binary.<p>When we got home I got out a pad and pencil and got her to write down 0, then 1, then asked her, if you only had two digits, what would come next? Tentatively she wrote 1 0. THen I asked her to add 1 to it. We more or less carried on the way this transcript went, except instead of using aliens with two fingers I introduced AND, OR and XOR 'boxes' that 0s and 1s go in and come out. I hadn't planned any of this but by the end of it she was just about drawing the circuit diagram of a full adder with carry bit.<p>I'm sort of thrilled to see that what I was doing is precisely the socratic method.

No doubt there are countless happy PayPal clients out there as well, these are just issues some have run into that everyone should at least evaluate. <p>PayPals reporting is extremely limited.<p>Virtually impossible to use for serious businesses without extensive external code or a system to manage customer flow/cross/upsells.<p>You spend too much precious time on e-commerce tasks and way too little time on marketing and dev.\nFor business-to-business products, clients do not take you seriously as a potential supplier if PayPal is your main payment method.<p>PayPal has very strict rules about the orders they are willing to let through, so merchants end up with fewer orders going through/lost revenue. They are quite picky about declining certain credit and debit cards other services would otherwise accept.<p>I log into my PayPal account and what do I see? For my protection they have limited the ability of my account to withdraw or send money but most severely, they also disallowed the account to receive payments! Frantically, I go to MacGraPhotos buy page, click buy and see a message The seller cant receive payments at this time. At about the same time I get an email from a potential customer that says that he cant buy the bundle. In the server log I see other people trying buy the bundle and leaving. Lost sales. Not good. Not good at all. My PayPals page lists lots of things that I need to provide to PayPal regarding my personal identity and regarding the sales. Some requests are totally not relevant to the case or to our businessAnd, its totally impossible to directly talk to the people who actually decideI receive another email from PayPal. The subject was new: PayPal appeal deniedSo, now the money (most of which is not even ours but of our bundle members) is held for 6 months. Sure, they are making every effort to minimize any disruption to your business. Sure, no disruption at allNeedless to say, I didnt get any response not after 72 hours and not after a week. I called support again and was told that they wont respond me because my appeal was denied and they dont reopen casesI wont be using PayPal to sell anything from now. They have grown too big to be efficient and caring for their customers. Quick to make totally disruptive decisions and to dismiss legitimate businesses without really taking a look at what it isThey took the liberty to totally halt our business, to cause lots of lost sales and a major cash flow blow only because we got successful with one promotion, after being their customers for a long time.

If so, read on.<p>Most of the teachers I work with would prefer to use the curriculum provided by their district because that's what their colleagues are using. This isn't out of laziness, but because it's helpful to have someone else teaching the same stuff so you can bounce ideas off each other. Rather than selling to educators, you might actually have to sell to districts. But computer science is such a small part of most districts, buying a curriculum for two or three teachers is likely a low priority.<p>I'm not sure if you're targeting Middle Schools (which to me seems like a very small market. I can't think of a district near me that offers programming to Middle School students) or High Schools, but many High Schools only offer AP programming. This must be taught in Java and due to time constraints it must be taught to the test. That makes designing a curriculum very difficult and most teachers would be hesitant to look at game design.<p>That isn't to say there aren't markets for stuff like this. I was in the market for it three years ago. Plus what we do offer at Middle Schools (Word/Excel/Web Searching) could be dramatically improved.<p>I did put together an ebook for my class, but I deliberately stopped short of offering it as a pdf/epub.

2446483,comment,2442274,2442274,1,0,tytso,,,"One of the problems that I see is that perhaps ""Computer Science"" is too broad.  MIT has been mocked by some for having a ""humanities"" department, where Theater, Foreign Languages, Literature, etc., are all combined together, but given how complex the world has become in the world of computer science disciplines, I'd argue that a ""Computer Science"" degree is almost as broad.<p>Consider the different sorts of work that a CS undergraduate might pursue:  Alice could become a CPU architect, working at Intel or AMD on the next micro-archtecture for the next generation of x86_64 chips.   Bobby could work on creating a new secure PHP framework that makes security exposures much less likely.   Candice could on writing J2EE applets for Ford.   David could become a GUI engineer.   Elaine could be writing the engine for an amazing new MMORPG.   Frank could be working on new compiler optimizations for the Go language.  Gerald could be a product manager for an amazing new consumer electronic device that's actually not derivative of other products.  Hermione might be a webmaven who can create a website using Drupal, Wordpress, or what ever else is appropriate/demanded by her clients.  You get the idea.<p>All of these require radically different preparation for a successful career, and one interesting question is where should that preparation take place?   On the job?  At a trade school?   At an undergraduate CS program?<p>Some CS programs focus heavily on Java programming these days.  Others still have a very heavy Systems bias (although I lament that MIT is no longer requiring undergraduates to build a CPU out of TTL chips :-).   Some try to spread themselves super-thin, and have a peanut-butter coverage of all of these topics, and assume that if student needs to learn the intricacies of the Java standard libraries, they can do that on the job.  Others will assume the same about what Virtual Memory is.  (No kidding, I was sitting in 1st year introductory CS graduate class at MIT when a student raised her hand, and asked in lecture, ""I'm sorry, what is Virtual Memory?"".   My jaw dropped.)<p>Similarly I think there's going to be a huge variety in salaries based on both the very wide range of talent available --- both in terms of quality, and their scope of training/skills/experience.   If a company only wants the very best and brightest, asking for $100k/year even for a recent college graduate isn't insane.   I've done phone screens for people who have been out in the industry for years, and they flubbed amazingly basic questions --- so much so that I wondered how/why their previous employers had hired them.   My personal conclusion is that the market is extremely tight for certain classes of software engineers (for example, really good Linux Kernel engineers), and some companies react by hiring anyone they can get, and other companies react by holding the line, only hiring competent engineers, and paying more if that's what it takes.",1302782867

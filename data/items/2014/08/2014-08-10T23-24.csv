8161256,comment,8160571,8161162,3,0,davmre,,,"If you&#x27;d looked at the site, the authors actually do the exact comparison you suggest: <a href=""http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/redmond/projects/hyperlapse/supplementary/html/bike1_timelapse_after_stab.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/redmond/projects/hype...</a>\nIt&#x27;s better than a raw timelapse, but not (IMHO) nearly as good as their results.<p>From the paper intro:<p><pre><code>    Video stabilization algorithms could conceivably help create smoother\n    hyper-lapse videos. Although there has been significant recent\n    progress in video stabilization techniques (see Section 2),they do not\n    perform well on casually captured hyper-lapse videos. The dramatically\n    increased camera shake makes it difficult to track the motion between\n    successive frames. Also, since all methods operate on a\n    single-frame-in-single-frame-out basis, they would require dramatic\n    amounts of cropping. Applying the video stabilization before\n    decimating frames also does not work because the methods use\n    relatively short time windows, so the amount of smoothing is\n    insufficient to achieve smooth hyper-lapse results.\n</code></pre>\nAnd later on (section 7.1):<p><pre><code>    As mentioned in our introduction, we also experimented with\n    traditional video stabilization techniques, applying the stabilization\n    both before and after the naive time-lapse frame decimation step. We\n    tried several available algorithms, including the Warp Stabilizer in\n    Adobe After Effects, Deshaker 1, and the Bundled Camera Paths method\n    [Liu et al. 2013]. We found that they all produced very similar\n    looking results and that neither variant (stabilizing before or after\n    decimation) worked well, as demonstrated in our supplementary\n    material. We also tried a more sophisticated temporal coarse-to-fine\n    stabilization technique that stabilized the original video, then\n    subsampled the frames in time by a small amount, and then repeated\n    this process until the desired video length was reached. While this\n    approach worked better than the previous two approaches (see the\n    video), it still did not produce as smooth a path as the new technique\n    developed in this paper, and significant distortion and wobble\n    artifacts accumulated due to the repeated application of\n    stabilization.</code></pre>",1407715157

The A380 is just a very high-profile victim of it.<p>The problems are twofold:<p>1. Four-engine airliners, regardless of size, are losing, basically worldwide, to twin-engine airliners with better fuel consumption. This is why the A380 and 747-8 sales are sluggish. This is why the A340 buyback program exists (airlines can&#x27;t get rid of the planes since nobody else will buy them), etc.<p>2. The airline market as a whole is shifting away from the &quot;have a single massive international hub and send all flights there&quot; model -- only a few airlines can really support that, and not coincidentally they&#x27;re the only ones continuing to buy A380s. This is part of the reason why the 787 and the A350 are selling so well; they enable flights to and from secondary or tertiary hub cities for which there is plenty of demand, just not enough demand to fill daily super-jumbo aircraft. This is why the 787 and the A350 are such a big deal, and why Airbus doubled down and announced a revamp of the A330.<p>Boeing is facing the same problem with its 747-8; the passenger variant just isn&#x27;t selling, the only airline that&#x27;s taken delivery (Lufthansa) has announced it may retire them within 5-6 years of acquiring them, and rumor has it Boeing is only keeping the production line open to win the contract to replace the VC-25 (the modified 747 better known as &quot;Air Force One&quot;).",1407712818
8161139,comment,8160071,8160331,1,0,sparkie,,,"I&#x27;d argue that adding the parameter for the allocator is almost always what you want to do anyway - the idea of the caller allocating the memory to be filled in by the constructor completely violates the idea of encapsulation - and it basically assumes that the memory required by the object is contiguous, of known size, or that the caller knows the exact layout - usually not the case.<p>For example, if I gave you the following API and expected you to use the constructor (requiring pre-allocated list), how would you begin?<p><pre><code>    struct list_t;\n    int list_new(list_t*);\n    int list_add(list_t*, Object);\n    int list_free(list_t*);\n</code></pre>\nYou have no idea whether I&#x27;ve implemented a linked list, an array, vector, vlist, or anything else - you simply don&#x27;t know how to allocate the required memory.<p>A constructor taking a pointer to an already allocated object can serve one useful function though - it can be the equivalent of a copy constructor in plain C. You still need the second argument or return value for the new object though, so the above API example is unfit for purpose.<p>On the &quot;error monad&quot;, I wish you wouldn&#x27;t call it this, because it&#x27;s potentially scaring away people who don&#x27;t understand what a monad is, or think it is something complex. Error (or Either) in Haskell has nothing inherently to do with monads - it&#x27;s just a data type with two constructors, one to construct successful values, and another to construct errors. The example you gave, of using &quot;map&quot; has nothing to do with a monad either, but is just a plain Functor for the Error type. Sure, there exist an instance of Monad for Error/Either, and they&#x27;re extremely useful, but that&#x27;s not all there is - it shouldn&#x27;t be defined as &quot;error monad&quot;.<p>The real value of the Error/Either type comes from the fact that it&#x27;s a tagged union, where only one of the constructors can be inhabited at any time, and to find out which, you must pattern match over the possibilities, with the compiler warning you if you don&#x27;t do so exhaustively. Functional languages also don&#x27;t allow you to simply ignore result of a &quot;function call&quot;.<p>Attempts to simulate this like style E in the blog post fall short, because one can simply ignore the result or the &quot;errorCode&quot; and attempt to use the object instead - and the compiler won&#x27;t complain. It&#x27;s not that these languages don&#x27;t have monads or functors - it&#x27;s that they don&#x27;t have the unit type, tagged unions and (exhaustive) pattern matching. Monad and functor instances for Error are bonuses once these are in place.",1407712797

However, the complexity exposed by DataTables is, at least partly IMHO, justified by the reality of how complex it is to do tables, especially in web app mode where &quot;tables&quot; are often dynamic entries that look nothing like tables whatsoever. In this latter scenario DataTables actually really do shine, at least once one has spent enough time to settle on a dev-routine that works.",1407712063

I&#x27;m now in Melbourne, Australia, which is considered by Aussies to have cold winters but as a Canadian I just laugh whenever I hear that.<p>Apart from the weather I&#x27;d say that a more legitimate reason not to move to Vancouver is the insane cost of housing, the most expensive in North America.

Some things that you now have to pay for with machine labor compared to human labor below:<p>1. Up front payments: Parents and schools subsidized the manufacturing cost of human workers. With machine labor that cost is passed on to the buyer.<p>2. Energy: Employees feed themselves via their salary, or is often the case with subsidized food stamps. With machine labor the cost of energy falls entirely with the owner.<p>3. Replacement: If employees die or are otherwise unable to work do to catastrophic events, they can be replaced immediately with little on-boarding cost. If machines fail catastrophically the investment is lost(or needs to be backed up with insurance). Also, on-boarding the new machine requires specialized higher wage human labor.<p>4. Repair and modernization: As machines age they incure greater upkeep costs. They also become obsolete by newer machines. As employees age and become less capable of performing their duties, they can be let go, free of charge, for poor performance and replaced with a younger worker.<p>Much like was discovered with slavery and indentured servitude, ownership of labor and free labor can be fairly close in cost if you know how to really exploit workers effectively. Harvesting in agriculture is an interesting place to look at how competitive exploited human labor can be compared to machine automation.",1407711749

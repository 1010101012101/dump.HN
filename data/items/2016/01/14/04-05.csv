Even advanced kernels can and do fail, or generate erroneous geometry on what one would think is a common, or simple use case.<p>That said, we are getting really good at basic geometry now.  Those basic cases are much fewer and far between with most users just seeing robust operation now.  It&#x27;s taken many years for this to happen, marking time at the dawn of affordable solid modeling CAD in the mid 90&#x27;s.<p>Now, it&#x27;s about getting computers to do what people can do, and that&#x27;s infer intent as we do with our minds eye and analytic skill.

Which means my network would need something close to 256 different DHCP clients before having a problem.<p>I do have some flexibility at home because I run my own dhcpd on OpenBSD, rather than relying on something in a router. Which means extra flexibility. So I lock down the IP addresses anyway. E.g. I have entries like this in my dhcpd.conf file:<p><pre><code>        host foo {\n                hardware ethernet 00:1b:63:95:1c:4f;\n                fixed-address foo.example.com;\n                default-lease-time 3600;\n        }\n</code></pre>\nThat lets me define IP addresses in a single location (my zone file). I don&#x27;t need to configure devices individually. The DHCP server recognizes the MAC address and knows what IP address to give to what device.<p>It&#x27;s a little bit of hassle to set things up this way, but there are never problems even if devices are stupid about when they renew their leases.<p>That&#x27;s not to take anything away from your comments, it&#x27;s just a workaround that has worked for me.

It can find strength / weight combinations that are very difficult to arrive at via the standard analytic means.  That&#x27;s worth a lot in some contexts.<p>However, these structures do not map well to existing manufacturing.  They do map extremely well to additive manufacturing, of which ordinary 3D printing is a core component.<p>CAD continues to segment:<p>The very high end of CAD is serving the major vertical markets, and typically what happens there is tech like this will get licensed, reverse engineered, duplicated, whatever and integrated into a greater whole ecosystem that goes well beyond geometry create.<p>Middle, or ordinary CAD, is being used for all sorts of stuff, and people don&#x27;t mind a bit longer workflow, or missing out on some features.  They want an effective tool at a great price, and their access to manufacturing tends to be as mainstream as the CAD is.<p>On the low end, CAD is being used for maker / hobby tasks, and a whole lot of experimental type work.  This tech is something to come out of that, and it&#x27;s currently being supplied to the mid or mainstream CAD market by a vendor looking to move up and own more of the stack.<p>Whether that&#x27;s successful or not remains to be seen.  There is a lot of legacy data, operations, systems that just can&#x27;t be ripped out.

10899688,comment,10894424,10894424,0,0,wdrw,,,"I did a Vipassana retreat a few years ago. Definitely an incredible experience, and I could see directly measurable positive effects on my thinking, on how I made decisions, etc. afterwards (although the effect does wear off after a while if you don&#x27;t keep meditating regularly). However, I feel I must mention some negatives as well. First, the course emphasizes many times that it is purely secular, but towards the end it slides into the more religious aspects of Buddhism (reincarnation and even some explicitly anti-scientific ideas). I feel that this can turn off a lot of the more analytically-minded/secular/atheist people, which is a real shame because Vipassana still makes a lot of sense without these religious aspects. Secondly, towards the end of the course there&#x27;s real pressure in the lectures to accept Vipassana as the &quot;one true way&quot; to meditate, and I got a little bit of a cult-ish vibe from some of the returning students and especially from the volunteers. Not to the degree that it&#x27;s going to be a problem for most people, but I can see how a small minority of &quot;brainwash-susceptible&quot; individuals, especially in a vulnerable stage in life, may throw themselves 100% into Vipassana after a retreat, instead of critically thinking about this powerful experience afterwards. So my advice: definitely do it if you can, take it seriously and give it your 100%, but don&#x27;t turn off your critical thinking skills during the lectures or after the retreat. If you can do it, there&#x27;s lots to gain.",1452746701

If you don&#x27;t mind sharing a little more: How does it differ from AJ English?<p>In general, the &quot;feel&quot; of the channel is different, to the point where if AJ English had another name, you&#x27;d have no idea they&#x27;re related. More specifically, AJ English is a bit more general in its global coverage, whereas AJ Arabic focuses more on the region. The two channels are completely independent entities actually, and it seems to work well.<p>> Also, maybe 15 years ago I&#x27;d hear how AJ Arabic was the only real journalism in the Arab world and a force for democracy and reform. Was that your experience? Is it still?<p>Personally, I believe yes, it&#x27;s the only channel that actually cares about the Middle East. Granted, I&#x27;ve only been watching it for 8 years or so.<p>> Finally, how and how much does AJ Arabic serve Qatar&#x27;s rulers&#x27; interests? How much better or worse is it than the other government sponsored competitors<p>As with any other news channel, AJ Arabic has a clear agenda. Put briefly: anti-Israel, pro-Hamas, anti-Egyptian government, pro-Brotherhood, anti-Iran, anti-Syrian government. Even with their clear biases, I feel they do a good job showing both sides of the equation, especially in their discussion programs.<p>The other competitors in the region are Al Arabiya, BBC Arabic, and France 24 Arabic. Al Arabiya is sponsored by the Saudi government I believe, but is headquartered in the UAE. Similar to AJ, it is anti-Israel and anti-Iran/Syria, but the rest is the opposite. So as you can see they usually cover regional news differently. BBC Arabic and France 24 are pro-Israel and neutral when it comes to Iran.<p>> The best coverage I&#x27;ve found, in English, of the Middle East is Haaretz and the Jerusalem Post, both from Israel. [...] They cover important stories I don&#x27;t see in AJ English and cover other stories better - though I read all three anyway.<p>I have not read it to be honest. I might take a look at it when I get the chance. However I would be truly surprised if it was actually neutral.<p>The way I see it is that there simply is no neutral news source. For me however, I feel that AJ Arabic properly represents and covers the Arab/Muslim causes, and does so in a professional manner.",1452746680

The lawyers have benefited a lot, and the abstract details insurance companies have gathered, but refuse to disclose based on HIPAA grounds to their own customers about themselves and medical practitioners treating those same people is often ridiculous at best.",1452744306

It&#x27;s the most complex object we know of in the universe and it collects and processes input for decades. That&#x27;s a pretty vast amount of stored information from which to produce an answer to your question.<p>We wouldn&#x27;t expect a 3-year-old to provide the correct answer, but we would expect a 30-year-old. This is a big hint that the brain does in fact collect and store information for later use. This would be analogous to filling in the books in the Chinese Room. If there hasn&#x27;t been enough time for all the books to get filled in, we won&#x27;t expect the room to give correct answers.<p>In addition, if someone has never heard of Lord of the Rings, we would not expect to get a correct answer either. That page of that book in the Room would be blank.<p>As for which concepts rest on which, we have to be careful, when discussing consciousness, not to mistake grammar for reality.

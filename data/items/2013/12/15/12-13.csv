6909224,comment,6908305,6908972,5,0,Chattered,,,"The original article is about a potential mathematical revolution, where computer verified proof has gone mainstream. The stuff about using weaker axiom systems, or getting theorems without needing AC is interesting, but I&#x27;d argue it is not so relevant. More important are things like this:<p>&quot;The thing that’s so remarkable about this new foundation is that the fundamental concepts are much closer to where ordinary mathematicians do their work. In the usual foundation, Zermelo-Frankel set theory, it takes an enormous amount of work just to build up the basic concepts and theorems that mathematicians rely on every day. The result is that if you want a computer to check your proofs, you have to teach it all that theory first. Essentially, you have to give it the same education you got — except that you have to do it in a far more exacting way. As a result, the only people so far who have used computer proof systems are computer scientists who specialize in it, and it takes them many years of effort to check a single new theorem. Georges Gonthier, for example, spent a decade checking the four-color theorem.<p>But this approach circumvents all that labor. Not only that, but the language the computer understands is far closer to natural mathematical language.&quot;<p>I should point out that the Four-Colour Theorem was formalised in Coq, not a ZF-based proof assistant. But that aside, these are pretty big claims. I&#x27;d like to hear what sort of basic theory is being talked about, and how the proofs are closer to natural language. On the stackexchange thread, ek comments:<p>&quot;Anyone who has used Coq will tell you that the proofs that you produce often don&#x27;t end up looking much like equivalent plain-English proofs at all.&quot;<p>But this doesn&#x27;t strike me as fair. I&#x27;m a HOL Light user, and the de facto proof style is procedural. In that style, which I understand is preferred also in Coq, the user tells the machine how to compose an assortment of automated tools to break down and solve the problem, often performing computations to massage the goal into a suitable form. The scripts are usually completely unreadable, but that&#x27;s by design. Those who want a more readable style of formalised proof are encouraged to use &quot;declarative styles&quot;.<p>How do the claims made about HoTT&#x27;s readability factor in here?",1387112183

The big Question is, which one?<p>Keeping following in mind:<p>- She has 4/5 months free where she can learn 5 to 6 hours a day intensively<p>- After this period, she would like to work as a freelancer (based in Europe)<p>- She would like to freelance (or be a contractor) for more established/bigger companies, no interest in working for smaller startups<p>- Should be web programming<p>My thoughts are either Ruby or Javascript with the rise of Node.JS and frameworks like Meteor and Express.

6909187,comment,6907592,6907771,33,0,omegant,,,"Airline pilot here with experience in B737, MD 80 and Airbus A320, so I know the flight controls philosophy of each one and the main differences.<p>-First of all, it is what it seems, it´s an elementary piloting failure. Once you disconnect the Autopilot and/or auto-throttle you must be first of all flying the plane on it´s envelope then navigating and last combating an emergency (if there is one).<p>-Second, I´ve heard first hand how the basic piloting skills like a visual approach or manual flying are very scarce in several Asian countries, one of them is Korean. This is due to the initial and airline training philosophy, for example Chinese copilots are not allowed to take the controls for landing or take off EVER (they have eternal training periods that are useless as they have no skills at all to learn ) I´dont know if this is true for all companies but at least several big ones work like this. Opposite to this in European and American companies, flight officers do half of the take off and landings due for the day, the only difference between a captain and copilot is that the captain is the one who decides the big questions, but the copilot is required to have the same piloting skills. In this case they were two captains one of them an instructor.. No words.<p>-third, there is an American instructor who wrote at Pprune (a pilot forum) about how for Korean pilots (trained in Korea), the worst emergency they can suffer in a simulator is a visual approach. Even worst than losing both engines or total hydraulic failure. They are scared to death of visual flying. . He was fired from Asiana for failing to pass the annual exam to one of Asiana´s top pilots for failing a common visual approach. It seems that due to the problems with North K. it´s not possible to flight small airplanes and practice the basic skills. I can not find the article right now, I think it was erased shortly after being posted.<p>-Fourth, it´s common to do mistakes with the flight modes while on final approach, both with airbus and Boeing, there are several descend and ascend modes, speed modes, and auto-throttle modes. But basically is that if you are high you want to descend faster, if you are low, you want to reduce your descend or even climb (in case of obstacles ahead), and you want to keep your speed inside the restricted limits needed to flight with the flaps for landing (too fast and they bend, too slow and you crash). When a mistake happens is normal to disconnect the autopilot and/or auto-throttle and take over on manual. But of course you are aware of what´s happening, is like going with the cruise control on the car, disconnecting it and failing to brake at the next light.<p>-Fifth, there are differences between airbus and Boeing, an airbus would have done an automatic full throttle to recover the low speed. But this kind of automatic behavior has other costs, for example the Air France´s A330 that crashed in my opinion was due to an overconfidence in such automatic recover. The problem (and this is my opinion) is that the pilot flying thought that just pulling the stick the airplane would do the rest to recover whatever he thought was happening ( Once it was in to a deep stall, it was impossible for the computer to recognize what was happening).<p>I think that crashing in crystal clear weather on a big airport just because you don´t know how to flight manually is a problem that some companies and countries have with the flight instruction philosophy, no amount of technology is going to solve that. Now Airbus is trying to increase the manual training of the pilots just because this same reason. They just went too far automatizing the flight, but airplanes and computers fail, and when they do it while flying you just can not stop everything to solve the problem, you have to land the plane safely no matter what.",1387111154

The company that claims to hold the rights to the porn is &quot;The Archive AG&quot; and the company that claims to have determined the IP addresses of porn-consumers is &quot;itGuards, Inc&quot;. Normally the expert-witness should be somewhat independent of the plaintiff, but in this case the websites of both parties have been put on by the same user on the same shared webhost: wix.com (funny enough &quot;wix&quot; in German is a homophone of &quot;to jerk off&quot;).

So if a nice lawyer sends out 100&#x27;000 cease-and-desist letters at a flat-rate of $10000 in total, you&#x27;d only be allowed to &quot;fine&quot; the receivers $10 for the porn-movie + 10 cent + postage or so. And if the lawyer &quot;fines&quot; the receivers $100 per rights-violation, he technically would have to bill the rights-owner 10 million dollars, even if the cease-and-desist doesn&#x27;t have any merit, every single receiver would ignore it, and a judge would through the case out. Unfortunately there&#x27;s no way to force the lawyer or rights-owner to let anyone know about their contracts, but sadly this makes almost every &quot;Abmahnung&quot; an invalid one, even though no one can proove it.",1387109027

Secondary benefits are protection from gravel flying up in our face as well as comfort from noise and weather - especially at speed.<p>Protective gear goes a long way, a helmet can save your life, leather can save your legs and boots can save your feet.",1387109013

If you work in a famous company, people could guess your salary. If you work for yourself, many things are unknown about you which irritates people. On the other hand people do business and does not reveal income to avoid paying taxes.",1387108975

It is a way of managing uncertainty and saying something with a precision that is available at a given point of time.<p>> How many discoveries are being overridden by new discoveries coming from future ?<p>This is beauty/and USP of science. Every scientific proof is always open for scrutiny and revision in light of new data or discovery ( tenants of falsifiability kick in here). That is, it tries hard NOT to be dogmatic by being provisional. For example, science says that we are confident Higgs Boson exists &quot;accounting for one-in-a-million chance on the contrary&quot; ( 5-sigma).<p>Let me flip your argument on the converse; success rate at which we could make ground breaking theories [ like evolution, theory of relativity , uncertainty principle ] ( which is standing the test of time for extended period of time) using the scientific method is sheer staggering and amazing. The methodology has accelerated our progress and understanding by leaps and bounds which no alternate system has managed to do so, so far!<p>> The amount of data accessible to the people in the past is a lot more when compared to current.<p>I lost you completely here. Can you please elaborate and the rest of the paragraph. ( My belief: If you take 20 random guesses; one of them turned out to be true; it is more likely to be a coincidence than a mystical insight. If on the contrary, the Monte Carlo filter I routinely simulate might just be the most insightfully entity I have encountered  ).<p>> The division between religion/science is very small<p>Epistemologically they are apples and oranges! Falsifiability is not applicable to religion nor is it is provisional and routinely advocates absolute (and imho dogmatic) reasoning!",1387108905

It was a fascinating weekend and a great opportunity to explore many NewSpace ideas. Chris Boshuizen gave a remote talk on the Friday.

Nikunj is a family friend; I’m looking forward to picking his brain about this deal and his view of the market.

In addition, the company will have a higher payroll tax burden because of the higher salaries. (1) is somewhat justifiable as investing in your employees may garner loyalty/harder work which may raise the top-line, but (2) seems unlikely. There are a lot of credit card processing companies.<p>What happens if profits aren&#x27;t as good next year? Are they going to slash wages to previous levels (or lower)?

It has to be made first. No matter what, there will always be some kind of a delay in when you can watch the next X of Y, simply because we haven&#x27;t invented time travel yet.<p>And I absolutely agree that the broadcast model -- where you see the thing only if you&#x27;re at your TV at the right time -- is a thing of the past, but there&#x27;s no reason that means serialization (which is what I think you mean by linear) should go away.<p>> I think because of binging, better quality content is being created that is more complete and movie like.<p>I won&#x27;t argue, by any stretch, that scripted serialized storytelling (non-film) hasn&#x27;t gotten markedly better over the last few years, but this kicked off long before Netflix dumped an entire season of HoC into your lap and can largely be credited to the shows that really raised the bar, like The Wire, The Sopranos, Mad Men, Breaking Bad, etc. All of those were serialized. Netflix is a johnny come lately to this trend.<p>And there is actually value in having time to <i>digest</i> what you just watched. You&#x27;re more likely to think critically about it and less likely to just swallow it as some giant mass of stuff. The social aspect of being in sync with other people -- even people you <i>just met</i> -- can mean finding new ways to think about the story that you didn&#x27;t have before.<p>All the netflix model does is make it so our episodes of TV are impossibly long, and their impact on popular culture much much less.

We discussed the pre and post press conference, speculated the motivation in what pushed Nintendo to break its sacred code of not venturing into mobile games, and how their competitors will respond as a result of this deal. We also broke down the mechanics of this deal and Serkan offered his bullish perspective on Nintendo’s future as a gaming company. While dissecting the news, Serkan helped to close the understanding on how LINE’s curated games platform is not working against Kakao Talk from Korea which adopted the opposite model, and also discussed how SoftBank is a “Berkshire Hathaway” for technology investments with successful forays in gaming space with SuperCell and GungHo, not to mention their past investments from marketplaces to taxi apps all over the world.",1428986189

For example, use <stdint.h> to get sane and guaranteed-width integer types.<p><i>Use functional programming style wherever possible</i>. Function pointers combined with void pointers lets you emulate closures with explicit context binding--something that&#x27;s pretty powerful. Functions that map over collections and filter over collection structs are powerful.<p><i>Write a solid unit test macro framework</i>. In less than 200 lines of C you can setup a project that will let you easily add unit tests and make sure your code is working.<p><i>Hide platform-specific things behind functions and typedefs</i>. Writing a simple cross-platform binding to OS primitives like mutices and files and whatnot can save you a lot of trouble if you ever need to port, as can any of the libraries out there that provide such things. My friends and I have a pretty well-vetted one we like to use for these projects.<p><i>Spend time writing safe arithmetic routines</i>. Writing a routine that lets you do different-sized integer addition and multiplication while catching overflows is <i>invaluable</i> if you are ever parsing or writing binary formats.<p><i>Abandon your error handling</i>. C can be made very, very verbose if you continually check for errors. For example, consider how often you can actually recover from a failed malloc()--and then consider that Linux will just plain lie to you. So, don&#x27;t bother sprinkling all of your code with &quot;well, tell somebody we bombed out&quot; unless it is truly fixable in the context of the caller.<p><i>Consider macros for a DSL</i>. The simple macros in C are not amazing, but can be used with a little thinking to build things similar to Flask route annotations or Java Hibernate annotations.<p><i>Allocate memory all the time</i>. Don&#x27;t mess about with buffers which might get overfilled or cause you to chunk things...just accept that you&#x27;ll allocate frequently and trust in libc until you <i>know</i> you&#x27;ve got a problem.<p>Those aren&#x27;t so much libraries as just techniques, but I think that covers a lot of what helps write C code quickly.",1428984877

Those are bad people actively discriminating against people they deem unworthy.<p>That being said, I didn&#x27;t say we shouldn&#x27;t speak. I said we shouldn&#x27;t speak for others. This article wasn&#x27;t written as &quot;here&#x27;s how I feel when this happens&quot; it was &quot;here&#x27;s how women feel when you do this&quot;. Generalizing in this way is just as sexist as any of the issues she brings up, if not more so, but because she wraps her sexism in good intentions we ignore it.<p>It&#x27;s hard to qualify disliking certain adjectives as worse &quot;shit&quot; then anything else you have to go through as a professional. We&#x27;re specifically talking about microagressions here, not firing someone for not sleeping with you, not excluding women from events, etc. These are not major issues, they are small things that make some people uncomfortable.<p>I understand it can suck when a company&#x27;s culture doesn&#x27;t fit, I deal with a fair share of bad culture fit as I consultant for many companies. I&#x27;m a 20yo male bisexual who doesn&#x27;t drink or smoke. I just spent time with a company where the entire staff went to the bar and I wasn&#x27;t just invited, but pressured to go and I felt very outside when I had to repeatedly refuse. I had a different client make unwarranted comments about us cuddling and he brought up multiple times who would be the big spoon (I&#x27;m unsure if he knew my orientation, I suspect he did). I later had a very negative falling out with him, was it because I ignored his advances? Who knows. My point is that we&#x27;re all different and you&#x27;re extremely unlikely to mesh perfectly with every member of a group, but being successful often means putting aside these things and doing business regardless. It sucks, but it&#x27;s an issue that will always exist and isn&#x27;t exclusive to women. It&#x27;s not called work because it&#x27;s super fun, it&#x27;s called work because you put up with crap and all these &quot;microaggressions&quot; are on the level of all this other crap.<p>To your final disagreement about me saying that men feeling bad are stereotyping women&#x27;s needs/issues, imagine you take what I&#x27;ve just told you about me and imagine we&#x27;re hanging out one night and we&#x27;re quite close, so you want to share some story about your sexual exploits from the night before. You start to tell your story but then think &quot;well, he&#x27;s bisexual, I probably shouldn&#x27;t tell him this story because he&#x27;s confused about his sexuality and trying to figure himself out&quot;. That&#x27;s you stereotyping, obviously. It&#x27;s no different than saying &quot;she&#x27;s a women, I shouldn&#x27;t call this software sexy&quot;. If you knew me personally and I had said &quot;don&#x27;t talk about sex around me&quot; then you would have grounds to think that. Similarly if I&#x27;m working with a women and she says &quot;hey don&#x27;t call me a guy&quot; then I say okay and I don&#x27;t do that anymore. But by assuming she&#x27;d be offended, I&#x27;m stereotyping.<p>The goal of communication isn&#x27;t to make everyone feel great all the time, you shouldn&#x27;t err on the side of inclusion, you should err on the side of openness, so if you say something that makes someone feel bad or out of place, they can say &quot;hey bud, pls don&#x27;t&quot;. By shuttering communication and wildly speculating about what all people of any group dislike or are offended by, you&#x27;re belittling their individuality and overall moving communication in the wrong direction.",1428984395

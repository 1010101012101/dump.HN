Just look at how widely the attempts to employ Six Sigma have been.<p>That said, being able to measure something isn't sufficient; one also needs the control to modify the thing being measured in a way that has deterministic effects on the metrics.  GP's metrics have that feedback loop with respect to software, which pushes it towards engineering.  Process engineers have that feedback loop, even on business processes.  Your manager does not; most of their actions do not create deterministic results.",1344430763

Second, it attempts to not only target an individual as sexist, but often the male gender as a whole as being part of a ""misogynistic boys-club"", in turn implying that masculine identity itself is inherently wrong. Third, it undermines genuine gender equality - if people are concerned about their criticisms being perceived as sexist they will refrain from open and honest critique which is the hallmark of colleagues and equals. Fourth, it assumes (paternalistically) a gender role for women as ""poor persecuted girls"" who need protecting from criticism and attack. Consequently, sexual inequality is perpetuated - after all, if this same criticism had been targeted at a male journalist would we expect to see responses such as ""you're only picking on him because he's a man""?<p>There are plenty of genuine cases of sexism (against male, female, and other gender identities) which emerge out of the obsolescence of traditional social roles.

4355114,comment,4353389,4354343,3,0,_delirium,,,"There's a large area of legal philosophy around those kinds of questions. Pragmatism vs. formalism in judging is one split that's sometimes identified, with ""formalism"" being closer to a view that the law is a precise set of procedures that must be followed mechanically, and ""pragmatism"" closer to the view that the law is a set of principles that must be applied using common sense to reach equitable outcomes. Lots of other positions as well, around that ""what <i>is</i> law, anyway"" question.<p>There are someattempts to formalize something like the pragmatic view, too (oddly enough), in artificial intelligence ""legal argumentation"" systems, which try to model the back-and-forth of adversarial legal systems, determining when to bring up an argument, how to counter an argument, etc.",1344428047

If Apple replies positively, the login request is accepted and the user is allowed access to the system.<p>See how this doesn't work for Filevault?

4355095,comment,4354036,4354628,1,0,quonn,,,"I don't think this is the case.<p>Here is how I understand it:<p>FileVault 2 uses a generated secret key for encryption ; It uses a table that contains for each account the encrypted key, encrypted in turn with a key derived from each user password.
It also generates a ""backdoor"" key that can recover the encryption key which you can write down or if you want (!) store with Apple.
The issue described here is not related to the actual full-disk encryption and the reason why the password reset does not work when cold-booting is not related at all to missing network drivers (as described in the article.) Rather it shows that the encrypted disk can't possibly decrypted by just reseting you Apple ID, because - if you have not agreed - FileVault has _not_ stored the backdoor key on Apple servers and it can't be used to recover the encryption key.
Why does recovery work when the machine is sleeping? Well, because in that case the encryption key is stored in memory and _can_ be restored if the OS wishes to give it up. It is well known that full-disk encryption only really protects you if the machine has been fully shut down. A dedicated attacker can usually recover the key by removing the battery and cooling the RAM to keep it from losing data.<p>I agree that not being able to turn off the option is a bug that should be fixed, but the situation is not as bad as it may sound at first.<p>TL;DR: FileVault 2 is just as secure as everyone assumed and even Apple can not decrypt your disk if the computer has been shut down. If it is running Apple could always use a backdoor if they wanted and other attackers could always extract data from memory.",1344427687
4355094,comment,4354239,4354239,1,0,michaelochurch,,,"Here are the problems:<p>1. If you ""complete an exit"", even a mediocre one, your stock goes up in a major way. You'll have no problem getting funding off the bat (i.e. you don't have to tap savings) and the most qualified co-founders once you join Those Who Have Completed An Exit. You can play again, and you've established the ability to maintain an upper-middle-class lifestyle (even if you got chewed up by preferences, earnouts, and shit like that) indefinitely while being a career-long founder. Most people don't do another startup when they get to this point, though. They either become EIR, swing into a larger company as a mid-level executive, or move into VC wholesale. Once these people are at the the point where VCs will fund you on a handshake and let you take a $200k per year salary as CEO, they're generally no longer happy with $200k. They want the $500k per year jobs, and after working 90 hours per week to make the last startup work, they're not interested in trying that again. Long hours are a one-shot pistol for most people; you do a few months at 100 hours per week, only to discover that it takes a decade to regain the ability to do that again (and it becomes worse as you get older, because you're increasingly cognizant of the incompetence that follows from overwork).<p>That goal of ""completing exits"" is the source of a lot of this mediocrity. Now, many people think they can slap something mediocre and flip it, and then later be able to do something genuinely interesting once they've earned the respect and presumed competence associated with ""completing an exit"". (The East Coast counterpart is the person who thinks he'll work on Wall Street for 5 years and then support himself as a writer or philosopher for the rest of his life.) It rarely works out that way. Once people join ""The Club"" they lose all interestingness and ingenuity. The same thing happens to writers and artists; they start out poor but genuinely interesting, have a hit, get invited into the cocktail party scene, and become deathly boring. That's also why most of these Manhattan ""artistes"" produce pure shit (some intentionally, and one or two literally).<p>A lot of people start out with genuinely productive ambitions (write a great novel, build new technology) that seem to require social climbing, and they believe that as they rise, they'll encounter more connected, productive, and interesting people. Only the first of these (""connected"") turns out to be true; what they find, instead, is that they're surrounded by increasingly competent, effective and brazen parasites. After all, the U.S. upper class in 2012 and the French aristocracy in 1785 are possibly the most effective sets of parasites in world history.<p>2. High house prices, in addition to destroying culture, produce mediocrity. When that much of an area's wealth is tied up in real estate, it's a cultural disaster. They result in mediocre people (by causing a wealth transfer to the wrong sorts) mediocre ideas, and the wrong kind of aspirations. The aspiration is no longer doing something great and far reaching; it's being able to afford a fucking house. People tend to believe otherwise, because the most interesting places are expensive, but they're interesting <i>in spite of</i> the expensiveness and all else being equal, the expensive real estate is a negative. In the long term (decades) this leads to urban decay due to the sticky nature of house prices ($500,000 houses in dangerous slums). It happened once and, unchecked, it will happen again.<p>The solution is to have a saner policy toward new development (instead of giving a say to rich NIMBY fuckers who shouldn't really be listened to be cause they don't add anything to anything cultural; in fact, their interests should be deliberately trampled for fun and sport because they are useless assholes) but also to keep prices sane by setting up a culture test, and capping what people can spend on real estate (rent or purchase) based on their culture test scores, because <i>uncultured</i> money (think real estate new money) is the bane of everything good and societies must do everything possible to keep such barbarism out. There's good elitism and bad elitism, and culture testing is the good kind.",1344427687

6580474,story,,,1,0,getsplashing,"I just launched the first free MLM company.",,"I am proud to announce on a site that I have loved lurking in for months now that my new network marketing company, The Wave, is now open for beta. I&#x27;d like to start by saying that The Wave is the FIRST COMPLETELY FREE NETWORK MARKETING COMPANY with NO CATCHES.<p>I. What is The Wave?<p>I have been a network marketer for about three years now, and one thing that really bothers me whenever I introduce someone in to the realm of truly great possibilities is that they are skeptical, having to put their own money in to the system. It works, I&#x27;ve great had success in it, but some people are just not motivated enough.<p>I developed The Wave to do one thing -- make a fair system where people can make money PURELY BASED OFF OF THEIR DRIVE AND EFFORT. I feel like the real problem in the world right now is that people are stuck thinking that they HAVE to get a college degree, they HAVE to have these certifications to make money.<p>The Wave is a network that is all ad-based, but NOT the spammy ads that you see all over websites. Every user activates ONE TIME a day, and then will make money when his/her organization does the same for the day. The result? Building residual income.<p>II. How do I sign up?<p>You can sign up at http://www.getsplashing.com, (front page is being modified so please ignore any odd design flaws you see). If you are using an invite code when registering, feel free to enter it. If you don&#x27;t, it will start your own team. There is really no difference between the two, besides helping someone else out.<p>III. How do I work this thing!?<p>When you log in, you will see your account page. This shows your left and right side activations, how much money you have made for the day, if you are currently active, your referral code, your money for the week, and the most recent person that you have referred.<p>If you click the activate tab, you will be redirected to our activation page. Simply click the button, watch the video until it&#x27;s gray, and you&#x27;re donezo! You&#x27;ll be activated until the counter below runs to 0, and then you will need to reactivate to be credited for any other activations below you.<p>If you go to the settings page, you will see where you can change your e-mail, set new signups through your referral code to the left or right, and new features will be added soon.<p>IV. Cool, so how do I make money?<p>Making money is VERY simple. When someone signs up through your referral code, they essentially start their own network. Their referrals will thus start their own network, so on and so forth. Think of it as a bunch of branches on a tree. The great thing about The Wave is that you make money off of EVERYONE&#x27;S branch that is underneath you, EVERY time they activate.<p>Thing is, if you aren&#x27;t activated when someone else below you does, you won&#x27;t get credit for their activation on whichever side underneath you they are. In other words, stay active! It literally takes a minute a day.<p>V. Sweet, and how do I get paid?<p>The way our payouts work are simple. You make $0.01 every time someone on each side activates. Basically, you are building an income from nothing to something off of building your network. You might be thinking, &quot;Only $0.01? That&#x27;s pretty low.&quot; We are in betaright now, and the company is completely free. We are working on increasing it, but the point is you are BUILDING here.<p>As for getting paid out, we are finishing the billing panel now. You will be able to get paid through Paypal or Skrill. You need a minimum balance of $10.00, and you can request a payment at any time. It will take us a maximum of one week to deliver it to you. *Your paypal / skrill must be verified.<p>VI. CAN I BOT IT?!?!1/1/!?<p>No. We can tell, we will ban, we will not be nice. We have to keep our sponsors happy, and we can&#x27;t do that if you are using botnets, proxies, VPNs, etc. Therefore, do not bot or exploit in any way shape or form. We reward our users if they bring threatening exploits to our attention that we didn&#x27;t know about previously.<p>VII. Is there a limit?<p>Nope. No limit!<p>Sign up here: http://www.getsplashing.com
Like the facebook page here: https://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Wave/586915218036504<p>P.S. We have only been around for under two daysand have already received 64,000 site hits, 700 unique visits, with 250 active users.<p>Questions? Ask them below. Feel free to post your referral code here, I couldn&#x27;t care less.<p>MONEY & POWER TO THE PEOPLE!",1382288011

In the case of iOS, Apple had a fresh start so there was no need for inter-compatibility between mobile and desktop apps, so no transition layer was ever created. For PPC > Intel, they created Rosetta (an emulation layer that allowed the older apps to run) in order to smooth the transition, and make it somewhat transparent to the user. This was a win by all measures, users got a completely different underlying system that was faster and more power efficient, and they never had to think about it; that&#x27;s not to say it wasn&#x27;t slow, but it wasn&#x27;t something you had to think about.<p>Microsoft really should have taken the route Apple did, it&#x27;s the same OS on new hardware that needs an emulation layer to run old apps- and that&#x27;s alright until there&#x27;s native builds of the most common suite.

Which is the reason that I contributed a tiny bit to linuxbrew (reporting bugs and suggesting fixes).<p>1) You need the newest version (ffmpeg for example is something that is often out of date on linux distros, or what about the latest and greatest gcc or llvm, or...)
2) Your distro doesn&#x27;t have it as a package. Case in point, debian (wheezy) doesn&#x27;t have ag (the silver searcher). After getting some issues fixed on linuxbrew, I was able to do &quot;brew install ag&quot; on my debian an there it was, a fresh silver surfer.<p>So I don&#x27;t agree with most posters claiming or implying that homebrew for linux is useless.

This can range from people who need medication to avoid seeing and hearing things that aren&#x27;t there to people who need CBT to get out of a self-destructive rut to people who need cosmetic surgery to feel like their body fits their subjective gender. But the United States is full of systems where you need a diagnosis to do anything--bill insurance, prescribe medication, declare someone to have a disability so they can collect income without working. So DSM is a tool for psychologists and psychiatrists to put a code down on a form so the system will let them help people.<p>This is why there&#x27;s a stipulation that it&#x27;s only a mental illness if it prevents you from living a normal life. Lots of people have the symptoms of mental illness, just not to such a degree that it warrants intervention. Having compulsive rituals is perfectly normal--compulsively washing your hands until they bleed is not. A good mental health professional will know the difference and only provide a diagnosis when it&#x27;s necessary.

6580338,comment,6579615,6579615,6,0,clarry,,,"I think Mozilla is right to tread carefully and not commit to yet another format for a minor improvement.  In my opinion our web clients are bloated enough as is, and they&#x27;re only getting bigger.  Once you add support for a format and it gains mainstream traction on the web, it&#x27;ll be really hard to remove, and we&#x27;ll be stuck with software that has to support so many things for reasons that do not make sense in the near future.<p>As for the study, I have to admit I did not read it.  But the first thing to note is that computed metrics (SSIM, PSNR) are not reliable approximations of perceived quality.  Optimizing for either will produce a codec that pleases the computer, not the eye.  This is why the tuning of image and video codecs for psychovisual effects is such a laborious, manual process -- you have to have a human viewer to assess the quality.<p>In the long term I think it would be good if a new still-image format was derived from the intra portion of some reasonably advanced video codec, as they all beat JPEG handily.  This is essentially what WebP is, but if I recall correctly, Google didn&#x27;t really give VP8 the love it needed when they acquired On2.  Instead they rushed with a &quot;release early, release often&quot; mentality, presumably hoping the community would jump the boat first and do the grunt work for them later (this was during html5 video wars when some thought Theora sucks and others thought h.264 is too encumbered -- VP8 was Google&#x27;s resolution).  The details are shady but the curious should search for the debate around early VP8 (I think the x264 folk did some extensive notes).  Needless to say I think, VP8 (and WebP) wasn&#x27;t and isn&#x27;t the game changer Google would&#x27;ve hoped.<p>To avoid patents, a reasonable choice would IMHO be to look at Xiph.Org&#x27;s upcoming video codec Daala.  Curiously Mozilla has the right man in house since Monty moved from Red Hat to Mozilla like, almost like yesterday...  Daala however isn&#x27;t quite ready yet as the Xiph guys are busy researching out new ideas and unicorns.  But the results so far are very interesting to say the least; anyone interested should check out Monty&#x27;s demo pages.[1]<p>As others have said, JPEG is &quot;good enough&quot; for most of us, and even JPEG is used rather inefficiently, often with too high quality.  So there&#x27;s no compelling reason to push for a new format here-and-now.  Give it some time and commit once there&#x27;s something significant I say.  In the future we&#x27;ll thank ourselves for not having deployed all that junk over minor increments.<p>[1] <a href=""http://people.xiph.org/~xiphmont/demo/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://people.xiph.org/~xiphmont/demo/</a>",1382285768

Generally you get what you pay for - if you order a &quot;Genuine Apple iPhone OEM charger&quot; on eBay sent from Hong Kong for $3, I guarantee you it will be a low-quality fake. But a $15 charger from a brand-name manufacturer should be reasonable quality.<p>Fake chargers will copy the UL marks and labeling, so that doesn&#x27;t help you. Of course, if it says &quot;Designed by Abble&quot; or &quot;Designed by California&quot;, that&#x27;s a pretty good indication of non-quality :-) (I&#x27;ve seen both of those on fake iPhone chargers - it should say &quot;Designed by Apple in California&quot;.)<p>The one thing people notice from bad chargers is their touchscreens malfunction when plugged into the charger. Bad chargers let through enough electrical noise to overwhelm the very small signals that touchscreens create.<p>When you say your laptop gets a lot hotter at 110V, do you mean the charger or the laptop itself. Chargers are generally a bit more efficient at 240V than 110V, so I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if it is a bit hotter.

There is no well-funded transnational environmental authority that can make a reliable &#x27;alarm&#x27; about the potential of mass common-water oceanic die-offs (think &#x27;tragedy of the commons&#x27;); Greenpeace is more of an advocacy organization than a scientific or monitoring authority.<p>One thing we can indirectly empirically gauge is the size of these large garbage patches at sea simply via imaging. In fact NOAA has put together a fact sheet on this [2], although it is rather simplistic. What we can glean from this is the fact that they are real, quite large, and if you look at the map it looks as though the OP&#x27;s voyage passed through it at least once if not twice. Which would explain much of what he saw, but not necessarily the consistency (pervasiveness) of the dead zones observed..<p>Finally, just food for thought (er.. perhaps bad choice of words.. haha) that there is a sort of conflation in the article about the long-going decline of fish stocks and accumulation of garbage due to dumping and the more acute poisoning/death of fish stocks due to radioactive leakage from Fukushima in the areas off-coast Japan specifically. There is academic evidence [3] that large fish, specifically tuna, are acting as vector to transport large amounts of spoiled biomass as far afield as California. How much of the biomass die-off does this explain? I have absolutely no idea, but since both issues are quite concerning in their own right we should probably keep tabs on both..<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.dailykos.com/story/2013/07/30/1227489/-Mass-Aquatic-Die-Offs-in-FL-NOAA-Declares-2nd-Unusual-Mortality-Event-Since-April"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dailykos.com/story/2013/07/30/1227489/-Mass-Aquat...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://marinedebris.noaa.gov/info/pdf/patch.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://marinedebris.noaa.gov/info/pdf/patch.pdf</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.pnas.org/content/109/24/9483.short"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pnas.org/content/109/24/9483.short</a>",1382285687

You can&#x27;t put it into a white paper because of several reason&#x27;s like time, money, and test conducting. This is like that, its experience and years of wisdom that are talking. Maybe a state will fund a study which will cost 10 million bucks and 5 years to do statistical fish and trash sampling to confirm it later on but without doing such things in the immediate term such a keen observation has and should have the weight and impact it deserves, by that I mean not being brushed off as there is not data and &quot; I didn&#x27;t see fish either&quot;, its deeper than that and the approach should be constructing rather than deconstructing.",1382285514

If people are having lots of sex but don&#x27;t want kids, we might see that in booming contraceptive sales. If people are having lots of sex but not using contraception and not having kids, well  that would show up in wider culture too (e.g. gay dating sites would proliferate). Sex on a personal level is a very private thing for many people in many cultures, but trends can always been seen because there is always a commercial side.",1382284883

2626890,comment,2593812,2593873,1,0,gwern,,,"> IMHO living for centuries with the body of a 90 year old wouldn't be so bad. (Supposedly there's a point where the body stops getting any more frail.) And as long as you can keep mortality risk to a low enough level for long enough, it's just a matter of time before youthfulness-restoring tech comes along.<p>I'm sure you've seen <a href=""http://gravityandlevity.wordpress.com/2009/07/08/your-body-wasnt-built-to-last-a-lesson-from-human-mortality-rates/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gravityandlevity.wordpress.com/2009/07/08/your-body-w...</a> already, so you know you <i>can't</i> live for centuries with the body of a 90 year old because the decay and mortality is just too bad, fancy exosuits or no.<p>So this leads to the kind of odd thought experiment which runs more accurately like 'imagine you have the organs and general health of a 12 year old, but are weak and debilitated and functioning at a low level (though not getting any worse); would you still find life worth living today?'<p>I'd say the answer is yes. Elderly suicide is more frequent than among the middle-aged or younger, so life isn't <i>as</i> good (not a surprising claim), but suicide is still rare, so life is still somewhat good.",1307397554

Worked fine; I mostly wanted to listen to entire albums, which mapped well to folders.<p>Then I got a Mac, and pointed iTunes at my music without backing it up first (because, after all iTunes was an <i>MP3 player</i>, and why would it <i>write</i> to my MP3 collection?!).  Oops.  Later I found that there was some import option I shouldn't have checked, and iTunes happily moved all my MP3s from their well-sorted folder structure into ""Unknown Artist - Unknown Album - Unknown Title"".  Yay.<p>Even when I eventually got some software that would use a music database to figure out what tracks were, there were a distressing number of tracks that it couldn't identify (hundreds), and of the ones it could, it mostly did so in a very literal way, such that I have a lot of folders like ""Movie Soundtrack - Artist Name"" with a single track inside.<p>Could I fix all this?  Of course.  Eventually.  Can you tell I'm still, eight years later, extremely angry at iTunes?<p>Now I just listen to Pandora.  Screw it.",1307397493

2626871,comment,2626489,2626489,14,0,tptacek,,,"Marco had <i>two</i> arguments on Build & Analyze for why he wasn't overly concerned with Reading List.<p>First, he didn't expect RL to have defer-reading, readability, <i>and</i> sync. But, like everyone's saying, it does. Shit.<p>Second, the defer-reading market is theoretically <i>huge</i>. It's something everyone needs to do. A tiny percentage captured off that market is worth millions of dollars.<p>iP is currently the best synced defer-reading app around and probably will remain so even after Reading List is released.<p>But more importantly, how hard is it to come up with 2-3 killer features to further differentiate iP from Reading List for the tiny fraction of the market required to be successful?<p>I'm sure it's dismaying to see what he expected to be an afterthought feature showcased in the keynote, but I'm still with him on the dynamics of this market. Reading List is not going to be the final word in deferred reading.<p>For whatever it's worth, Marco is the one I feel bad for here. Most of these other applications were so clearly implicated by Apple's roadmap that it's hard for me to get too worked up about it.

2626864,comment,2625405,2625997,2,0,wbhart,,,"LLVM has almost no support for GC and it is about the biggest problem that just hits you in the face when you use it.<p>What I've been doing for my own experiments is very naive (and quite possibly broken). I've been implementing an interpreter with all GC done on the ""compile side"" of the Jit. What this means is that to allocate at runtime it reaches back around and calls functions which are pre-compiled into the interpreter codebase.<p>The interpreter itself uses linked lists extensively for its symbol table and to hold references to memory that it needs at compile time, and this is just hooked into by Jit compiled code at runtime, i.e. there's automatically an object associated with each allocation done at runtime because there is an object associated with it at compile time which is stored in the symbol table. Once a given object is out of scope, assuming no other object (which is still in the symbol table) holds a reference to it, the GC can then see the object can be cleaned up.<p>[And just writing this I know this sounds very much like nonsense. After all, once something is out of scope at compile time, what is to stop the GC cleaning it up before runtime? Indeed one has to be careful about this. In my case, the source code itself is connected with the symbol table. The source code is itself represented as a linked list and the symbols in it <i>are</i> the symbols in the symbol table. Until the source is relinquished, the part of the symbol table that is currently in scope is not relinquished. And of course the source is not relinquished until after it has been ""evaluated"", i.e. Jit compiled and executed.]<p>So far I haven't managed to trick it, and it is very efficient. But then again I'm using Boehm-Demers-Weiser which is possibly so conservative that nothing is actually getting cleaned up in the examples I am running. I simply don't know.<p>I do know that this is a technical kludge and (I think) I can see it isn't going to work for a compiler, only for an interpreter.",1307397249

It somehow refutes my claim? How exactly? Have you ever heard the phrase quasi-religious? Perhaps you should have some sympathy for someone with Andi's dearth of vocabulary. It adds nothing to his earlier comment and takes nothing away from it either.<p>You are making Andi out to be the unabomber, he does seem like a reasonable person - you are completely overreacting to all of his comments for some utterly bizarre reason. His comments are irrelevant to what we are talking about. Your whole basis of argument now is that Andi is some sort of certifiable nutcase. Time and again I've said his comments are not relevant, nor do they show anything of the sort, what has you so agitated about the one in the link you provided?<p>Even if you were somehow magically correct in delivering a devastating psychoanalysis of Andi, over the internet based on some comments, you can't argue with this: there is no forced binary choice to be made between living as luddites, and ignoring the cost of nuclear reactors for nature and future generations. But you continue to. Do you disagree with this statement? It's what I'm calling you out on, and you seem to have a massive problem with it.<p>What proof of principle solution? Your oil well suggestion is no solution to anything. Are you referring to something else perhaps?<p>I'm sure they have pulled and will continue to pull lots of useful materials out of the areas and people near e.g. Fukushima and Chernobyl that our past, current and future research will make useful for future generations: cancerous thyroid glands, contaminated milk, water and aquatic life with 2Sv of radiation in it, irradiated metal and farmland.<p>To demonstrate that there is a net cost of nuclear power to future generations: accept that nuclear plants are supported by tax breaks, and the cost of shutting down nuclear plants is so great that it cannot be undertaken by their owners and caretakers. This must be undertaken by the state taxpayer. After they have been shut down, the waste cannot be processed by current technology and must be stored and protected by the taxpayer. When the plants are no longer generating profit - the vain hope for the enterprise to benefit future generations is that someone invents some way of processing their waste. This is the same vain hope those had when they built these reactors in the the 50s/60s/70s. Sure, they produced power for a few decades - the waste however will cost taxpayer money for millennia.<p>I will repeat myself again, perhaps you may notice this time: there is no forced binary choice to be made between living as luddites, and ignoring the cost of nuclear reactors for nature and future generations.

It's clear that they want to own their entire ecosystem; they want to own the application delivery, they want to own the advertising delivered by it or associated with it, they want to own the hardware and peripherals, they want to own the social atmosphere associated with it, they want to own their customers' data storage ...<p>And that's fine, for Apple and for their customers. But, I can't imagine any reason why any developer in their right mind would see competing with all of that as anything more than a short-term prospect. If you're successful, Apple will eventually try to own you (either by buying you, or, more likely, rolling out a competing product leveraged by the rest of their ecosystem); if you're not successful, it might not be worth doing in the first place.<p>Short-term (say, 1 to 2 year) projects can make decent money, and I guess that's good enough for most people, but there's no point to trying to develop longer-term relationships with customers, or branding, or a market of your own.",1307396172

All companies are looking for value adds and providing a good/better/best/integrated/whatever version direct in the OS layer is a great way to do this. If you owned a platform, you would do the same thing where appropriate.<p>Smart businesses don't just build an app or a feature, they build a whole business and potentially even a whole platform. For example, look at Remember The Milk or Evernote. Sure, Apple can make their own cloud-synced todo list app. Great. But, RTM is on many different platforms, as is Evernote. They have thousands of customers that will keep using their app even though a system app might do the same thing.<p>My point is just because apple turns your feature into their feature doesn't mean you can't have a successful business. It just means you have to adapt and change. It's no different than if you were running a successful little coffee shop and Starbucks opens up across the street. You can whine that it isn't fair that Starbucks Megacorp Inc. just showed up next door stealing your thunder, or you can take care of your customers so that they don't go across the street.<p>In the end, business is competitive. You have no inherent right to build software or sell it on a given platform or in a given store. The fact that Apple, Google, Microsoft, HP, Amazon and so on make worldwide distribution for indie devs so easy is completely 100% incredible.<p>Just try and sell a physical copy your $0.99 todo list app or game at every Wal-Mart, Target, Best-Buy, Gamestop, Verizon/At&t/Sprint shop in the country then maybe you'll have an idea of just how good you have it.",1307395370

I daresay a lot of pirates (who currently contribute $0) will pay $25/year for their music to be legal... for legal or moral reasons. The potential loss of revenue will lie on the people who buy 1-2 CDs/year.

The addition of the Tweet API is another way to address a symptom of the underlying problem of not having a way back.<p>It is an interesting and significant difference, and I think the flexibility of Android's system is one of its great strengths. It's always been able to do what the Tweet API does, more flexibly, because app developers can just send focus to the user's preferred twitter client instead of having to write in the twitter functions they want, and don't need new functionality built in to the OS.<p>Certainly it requires a bit more sophisticated user (not that iOS users are dumb, just that you have to understand what's happening, and it could very easily be confusing to a naive (non-pejorative sense) user), but it's really a joy to use.<p>EDIT: I know I shouldn't care, but the systematic downvoting is really starting to get to me.",1307394512

She just isn't going to do that, because being as wrong as she was ought to (and will, eventually) get her tossed.<p>Being able to own up to your mistakes only works when you're trying really hard to be right.  That's the difference between the two forms of being wrong; one's a consequence of trying, and the other's the sin of political drudgery.<p>Either OP doesn't get that Palin's not trying very hard to be right so she can't realistically admit she was wrong, or he thinks that it's ok for her not to be devoted to the truth.",1307394155

I guess it's an open question for me whether this is a transcoding service or a music license.<p>Arguably, if I have a crappy MP3, and I pay Apple money, and they give me a version with a higher encoding rate, they have sold me the new bits for that song. Maybe the terms don't say that, but I think one could argue that I've paid for a copy of the song.<p>In fact, I think that the labels, in an effort to make us repurchase our records as tapes and our tapes as CDs and our CDs as files, have tried to tie the license to the format. So that seems to back the idea that this deal gives me a license for the AAC-formatted file. Whether I had one for the MP3 is irrelevant, right?<p>And would it be so bad if that's how the law sees it? This could actually be a boon for the recording industry. It could be win-win if pirates decide to do this: they start paying for music, they still get all the music they want, and they shift the distribution burden to BitTorrent and iTunes.",1307394029

914942,comment,914711,914711,0,0,human_v2,,,"It depends. I don't think a web interface will cut it. Professors will still need office hours or a chat interface. If this was actually the case, don't you think students could just as easily sit at home and read the book instead of going to class? At some point, the lack of teacher-student interaction is going to cause the quality of education to suffer. I imagine this would be unacceptable to universities that take their reputations seriously.",1257072885

914937,comment,914878,914896,0,0,mseebach,,,"Your visitors that can't spell their own email address is likely to screw your obfuscated address up as well. I've seen email in my outbound queue to whatever@domain.dot.tld and variations. I wouldn't be surprised if someone never realizes that AT is @ (in non-English speaking locales, @=at is not at all obvious. In the Nordic languages it's known as (elephant's) trunk-A. ) and gives up before the mail leaving the client.<p>reCaptcha Mailhide (<a href=""http://mailhide.recaptcha.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mailhide.recaptcha.net/</a>) is a good solution to this.<p>It hides your e-mail behind a CAPTCHA, but once it's solved it's an actual, well-formed address, that can be copied or clicked. Also, it's very clear if you've solved the CAPTCHA - it's no always clear if solved the ""riddle"" of an obfuscation correctly.",1257072576

I don't think I agree.  The fact of the matter is that as humans, we are essentially unable to reason about how beings with a different set of senses would think.  With respect to cosmology, we basically react to how light moves around and that forms the basis of our science (our other senses don't really come into the picture).  Its very difficult to think about an intelligence based on some other source of information and impossible to know what sort of data would be present (since we don't have access to the information).",1257072270

914928,comment,911858,914706,0,0,WalterBright,,,"You can do ""header"" files with D, too. They're called .di files and the compiler will even generate them automatically, or they can be built by hand.<p>The compile speed advantage D has over C/C++ is that in the latter the header files must be reparsed for every source file. In D, the header files only need to be reparsed once, and then it is looked at symbolically for the rest of the source modules.<p>D is also faster at compiling because the lexical grammar is designed to require little processing.",1257071806

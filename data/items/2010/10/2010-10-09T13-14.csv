Downvotes on reddit make this go double.  Even great content can get buried if it doesn't get noticed.<p>For instance,  there's a certain blog on a three letter domain name for which I'll sometimes see two or three posting on the front page at HN.

This sort of practice takes some of the chance and variation out.<p>An advanced method is to recognize the role of ""social proof"" in social media.

1774998,comment,1774156,1774586,0,0,aik,,,"Beautiful analysis, thank you.<p>To take your analysis one more step, I would like to break out the ""I"" component of your model a bit further.  The ""I"" could comprise of ""N"" (inner nature/general intelligence) and ""B"" behavior, as I believe behavior can fluctuate independently of inner nature/intelligence and so should perhaps not be grouped.<p>Most behavior (B) early on arises out of primary influences.  These influences are mostly people who one idolizes or looks up to, which depends some on one's inner nature (N).  For some, the family (F) is the main influence and role model, other times friends/peers (P) are, and other times other societal influences (movies, media, community, etc.) are the leading influencers.  Within schools, where a large part of a child's life is spent, teachers (T) are the primary influencers.<p>Given this, and given that influencing children is easier than influencing parents/adults/community/media, reeducating or focusing on teacher quality sounds like a good option.  The ""T"" improvement would then improve the ""B"", the ""B"" improve the ""P"" and ""F"", and life would be very hypothetically good.<p>S = ?F + ?P + ?B + ?T + ?N<p>So here I'm not saying that teachers are a primary fault for the problems, however my main point is that I do believe they can supply massive positive influence (just like the P and F can), which in most cases they aren't doing.  Perhaps this shows that the role of a teacher needs to be rethought from authoritative instructor focusing on knowledge transfer; to friend, mentor, care-taker, and personal guide to each individual in hopes of supplying inspiration.",1286631341

The fake accounts were made with a statistical model that generated plausible usernames,  real names,  profile pictures and everything -- it could even pair up the gender of the first name and of the picture...  most of the time.<p>Once she wrote a blog post she'd just set the sequencer and her posting would hit the front page in about two hours.

You really can't predict what the next request will be - the browser can reuse the connection for some other request at a whim.<p>And I'm sure there's some proxy around that will panic if it gets a response before getting a request.<p>> Keep-alive on pretty much implies that pipelining is ok.<p>Well, sure, in theory.  But since nearly every browser keeps it off (edit: doesn't pipeline requests), obviously a ton of servers are broken. Even Flickr was broken for many years with pipelining on (image downloads would abort randomly). Chrome is planning to eventually enable it with a bunch of heuristics; hopefully that will improve the situation.<p>Edit: ""Making HTTP Pipelining Usable on the Open Web"": <a href=""http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-nottingham-http-pipeline-00"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-nottingham-http-pipeline-00</a>",1286630658

As soon as it has done that it will look for more input.<p>Both sides can 'cheat', in other words, you don't actually need to look at the input requests when you're a server, and you don't actually need to wait for that first response to arrive before sending the next if your'e a client.<p>The socket layer doesn't care one bit, to it it is all data, and the application layer presumably would have a hard time telling when certain bytes were sent if it is not explicitly polling the other side of the connection while generating another answer or reading a new request.<p>So, typically the sequence on a keepalive connection looks like this:<p><pre><code>  request - answer - request - answer - request - answer - etc
</code></pre>
But you could do this: (the google bot situation):<p><pre><code>  request - request - request - answer - answer - answer - etc
</code></pre>
or even this (which is how my old webcam software worked):<p><pre><code>  request - answer - answer - answer - request - request - etc
</code></pre>
So as soon as you switch on keep-alive you give the other side the opportunity to start pipe-lining requests <i>or</i> answers.<p>The problem with the way the google bot works here is that they seem to log all the pipelined but as yet unanswered requests as 'failed' whereas they should only log the request that was next up for answering as failed.<p>The obvious solutions are either keep alive 'off' for google or speed things up to the point where it will simply work.",1286630633

Any student with a learning disability on record (including ADHD) is all but exempt from any standards set by the teacher.<p>Furthermore, teachers are encouraged to ""round up"" to look better for the school district. If a student fails a class, they will spend time in front of a computer for 3 weeks to make up the credit. If a student fails to have enough credits before graduation, they will still let you walk the stage and you can simply come back during the summer to sit in front of a computer.<p>There's no social stigma of failure in the school's culture anymore, and that also comes from the family life (the F from jamwt's post). The student could care less about grades because the parents don't care and they will just have them work at the shop after high school.<p>This carries on with the teachers. Tenure is a very dangerous asset that a teacher can have, and it keeps the bad teachers in. Students will come into my wife's English class without a basic knowledge of sentence structure and many other things that ought to have been known by this age, and the grade level below her shows videos for a very large amount of time. They will read 1/4 of Romeo and Juliet and just watch the rest on TV without any analysis of the material.<p>This is a social and political system in which individual failure has been discouraged, removed, and subsidized. While positive reinforcements (good grades, more money after graduation) can certainly help, the fact that the lack of hard work can be shrugged off so easily <i>has</i> to be a component of school under-performance.",1286629951

Just because every other guild host out there offers bulky flashy layouts does not mean that is what the market wants now. Any user of those sites you talk to now will tell you they are not happy with any of it and just use it because they are not aware of other options. We have done the research in that aspect.<p>However skinning is something we are working on now, we left it out till we had our own designer to offer base themes. Its top priority now. We always hoped to get a designer on board early but we were unable to do so we focused on features and quality.",1286629730

Why would I need a ""complex"" tool like this, when I can simply note down the most important questions on a piece of paper or in a simple text file? Yeah, I can collaborate with people remotely, but a simple skratchpad does the same job. For me, it feels like another way of procrastinating instead of simply getting the job done, as I have to deal with an interface (even if it is relatively simple) instead of just letting my ideas flow.",1286629728

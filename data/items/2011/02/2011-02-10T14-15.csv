These simply don't apply to some languages.<p>Dependency Injection is not one of these and actually has widespread applicability. Although the name always sounds wrong to me since it makes me think of dependency creep, one of the problems that it is intended to alleviate.<p>Design patterns have gained an ""enterprisey"" reputation because much of the time they are represented as if each one is a universal, language agnostic solution. They reek of cargo cult management.<p>Every language and/or ecosystem will have its own set of effective design patterns that will partially overlap with those of other ecosystems. Some communities care more about making names for the patterns, which could in itself be considered enterprisey.<p>Interestingly enough, the person that first told me about design patterns was a Python hacker.",1297349890

The managers enforce it by threatening to quit if they discover someone below them on the org chart is being paid more. Sure, some managers are replaceable so let them quit, but the organization has to weigh the cost of disrupting an entire branch of the org chart, and perhaps losing a talented manager, vs. just giving them the raise (plus pile more work on their plate to justify it)<p>Programmers can be managers too by volunteering to lead new initiatives that will require new staffing. The key to being seen as a an effective manager is to manage down (relate and motivate your direct reports) and manage up (relate your team status and exciting initiatives to your boss) To continue up the org chart you must volunteer to take on more responsibility at every opportunity until you don't go home at night at which point you have to ask is this really worth it?",1297349782

We do need some somewhat sensitive information to run our reverse auctions, like the amount of credit card receipts a company expects. We're going through the process of TRUSTe and BBB certification. It's not really much of a process, really, you pay ~$1000 they ask a few questions and you can put the seal on your site... As we know seeing what happens in the credit card processing business, there are many companies that have A+ ratings that treat their customers like crap. Until a few months ago, Ritz Carlton, Disney, and Wolfgang Puck had F ratings but Hamas had an A grade.
(see here: http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/business-bureau-ritz-carlton/story?id=12151154)<p>We're doing the TRUSTe certification, and they only asked a few cursory questions... but they present case studies with a significant bump in conversion rate (trustguard has a somewhat hilarious link on their site that says ""Trustguard increases conversion rate 60%).

Now I just need to get a copy of the actual ""Engineering a Compiler"" everyone has recommended I read. :-)<p>I've just started reading this book, (older edition), after reading many recommendations that it would be a good place to start for beginners. I find it is an enjoyable read, but I don't really feel like I'm learning how to write a compiler. Much of the text seems devoted to the experience of wrestling with the restrictions of the technology of the day, (e.g. compile times were 12-24 hours because they had to wait for tapes generated by one half of the compiler at one location to be couriered to another location to be finished). I find this fascinating, but it's not really helping me learn to write a compiler.

For data-driven applications or native apps that don't require advanced 3D animations, it does a very good job providing a native user experience and access to device APIs.  To describe how it works briefly, you write JavaScript code which maps to native APIs - that code is then included in a native app binary along with a JavaScript interpreter, and is interpreted at runtime on the device.  A better/longer explanation is here:<p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4217551/what-happens-to-javascript-code-after-app-is-compiled-using-titanium-mobile/4798547#4798547"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4217551/what-happens-to-j...</a><p>Titanium has been deployed in over 12,000 apps in the Android Market/App Store, more than any other cross-platform framework (that we know of), so many developers have found success using it.  That said, no technology is a silver bullet, so you'll need to take a look at your application and decide what is the right move for you.<p>If at some point while using Titanium, you discover you need more native functionality than we currently expose, it's easy to write a native extension (well, easy if you know Objective C and Java).

Feel free to reach out to me directly (community@appcelerator.com goes to my inbox) and I'd be happy to help out.<p>EDIT: We actually just demoed an AR app using the device camera, but the source isn't up yet (not sure why not, but it will be open source).

Reserve a set number for each person onthe planet and give it to them when they ask for them?  I don't think I could count all of the problems with that idea.  Hand them out some arbitrary number of some supply in a first come first serve manner?  I don't see how that would be an improvement.<p>The system needs people to generate blocks in order to provide the security of the system, but generating blocks has costs associated with it (hardware, electricity).  Why not reward those block generators that are providing the system's security with new coins for each block they generate, at least until the number of transactions per block grow to a point that block generators can charge transaction fees?<p>Block generators aren't just generating blocks for the fun of it...they want bitcoins so they can spend them, which means those bitcoins will go to others, who can then further spend them, etc.  Anyone can do it.  GPU mining is profitable for most who wish to make the investment.  There's no central authority choosing who gets to generate new blocks.  Each person chooses whether they want to generate blocks or not.<p>If you don't want to generate blocks, but still want bitcoins, then you offer goods/services for bitcoins.<p>So far no one has thought of any less arbitrary way to introduce bitcoins into the network while continuing to support the security of the network at the same time.<p>And the term ""proof-of-work"" is misleading.  They're generating blocks in such a way to deliberately make it difficult for someone else to attack the network by generating replacement blocks in an attempt to double-spend their bitcoins.  They're not doing these calculations as an attempt to prove they're not some malicious node.  Block generators do the work of creating a block, and if someone wants to double-spend their money, they have to generate that block and every single block that's been generated afterwards with <i>at least</i> the same total difficulty of the other blocks.  This can only theoretically be accomplished if they have more processing power than the entire bitcoin network, and even then it would take a long time to do unless they had <i>a lot more</i>.  Otherwise they just fall further and further behind as the bitcoin network block generators increase in power and the difficulty increases.  Contrary to the <i>opinions</i> of some, these calculations are not wasteful, but are a necessary part of the system's security.",1297346931

You commit changes to your git-branch and deployhq will ssh into your production server and update the code. Extra commands (e.g. rake db:migrate) can also be executed. It's basically like Capistrano but as-a-service, but easier to set up (and less versatile probably, but I haven't come across anything I couldn't do).<p>They're also working on Deliverhq, basically transactional email delivery like Sendgrid.",1297346630

Nokia came to the top because they offered quality dumbphones, not because they offered a completely different experience.<p>Now there's iPhones (which Nokia can't really do anything about), and Android phones (which Nokia can do better than anyone, if they really try), Windows Mobile (maybe) and burning platforms like Symbian (despite Qt rocking, or so I'm told).",1297346500

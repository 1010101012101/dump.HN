So he had to come up with ways of overcoming that problem.<p>The trackpoint performs very well for mixed typing and pointing tasks, since you switch between typing and pointing so often, and that adds up to a lot of time, and is a very common way of using computers. The mouse is still better for tasks that are mostly pointing and clicking, but it takes up some prime real-estate on your desk, and there are many situations where a mouse is impossible to use with a laptop.<p>He also made the observation that when the cursor moved above eye tracking speed, you tended to lose track of it. And also the observation that some of the time you needed to position it finely around a small area, and other times you needed to move it quickly across a large area.<p>So he came up with a pressure-to-speed &quot;transfer function&quot; that had a non-linear mapping from how hard you were pressing it to how fast the cursor moved.<p>The mapping had a plateau at &quot;predictable fine positioning speed&quot; (i.e. there was a wide range of light pressure that would map to moving the cursor at one exact slow predictable speed, so you could smoothly cruise the cursor around with a light touch at a speed that was good for exact positioning. Then after the plateau of light pressure, it sloped up smoothly until just below eye tracking speed, where there was another plateau, mapping a wide range of harder pressure to a fast-but-not-so-fast-that-you-lose-track-of-it speed, for coarse positioning without losing the cursor. And then above that there was a fast speed for quickly flicking the cursor to the other side of the screen.<p>They did lots of user studies and took lots of measurements and performed lots of experiments to determine the best parameters for the pressure-to-speed transfer function, and finally came up with one that was measurably good enough to make IBM happy and ship in products.<p>So after pooh-pooh-ing the name &quot;Joy Button&quot;, IBM finally settled on and trademarked the name &quot;Trackpoint.&quot; But one concession they made, was when they published a two page ad spread in Time Magazine with a close-up of the trackpoint, above the slogan &quot;So hot, we had to make it red!&quot;<p>Another crazy but brilliant innovation he developed was the Thinkpad 755CV [9] that you could remove the back of the LCD screen and lay it down on an overhead projector to project the video! Nobody probably remembers overhead projectors any more, but they were very popular at the time, and that feature could save you a lot of money, and you never had to reboot it three times just to get the video on the projector, like with modern laptops!<p>[9] <a href=""http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/Category:755CV"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/Category:755CV</a><p>He also made a prototype Thinkpad with TWO hot red trackpoints on the keyboard, which invitingly resembled a pair of nipples. It was very popular with everyone he tested it on, but unfortunately OS/2 had no idea how to cope with two pointing devices, so there wasn&#x27;t much use for it, besides being a wonderful ice breaker at parties.<p>I don&#x27;t know if his lab is the one that invented the butterfly keyboard, but it was another in a long line of wonderful innovative ideas that were coming out of IBM&#x27;s research labs and showing up in the Thinkpad at the time.<p>I learned about this stuff from the talks and demos he gave at his NPUC - New Paradigms for Using Computers [10] workshop that he produced at IBM Alameda Research Labs. [11] -- it was a really great free workshop, including free lunch, with people like Marvin Minsky and John McCarthy!<p>[10] <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC3SPFfKQMM"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC3SPFfKQMM</a><p>[11] <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10AB0yqxGEw"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10AB0yqxGEw</a><p>Ted Selker, not Edwin Selker, explains the theory and story behind the Trackpoint.

Or, an actual DBMS with MVCC with SSI, like a modern Postgres, would simply execute the read on its snapshot and thus force the reading transaction to precede the writing transaction in any equivalent serialized order (even though the read happened after the write in realtime), and only abort the transaction if that could lead to contradictions (cycles) in the dependency graph.",1429973403

Another thing is some of those RC bugs are security issues, which are handled by Security Team for stable and oldstable, so there is no reason for security issues to delay the release. When all these are considered, they may have not deemed further delaying the release worthwhile.<p>I would also like to hear the real reasons from a team member, though.",1429972990

What right do you have to begrudge others&#x27; success? Are you jealous? Do you give away all of your money? Based on your screen name it would seem that you have some connection to Marin County; one of the richest counties in the country. Unless you&#x27;re living under a bridge, that would imply that you have some money. How much did you send to Nepal today? How much did you send to Bay Area homeless shelters? How many hours have you volunteered? I&#x27;m willing to bet almost zero -- because you&#x27;d prefer to spend and criticize other people&#x27;s money. You&#x27;re the kind of person that would call for tax increases &quot;on the rich,&quot; while you yourself give not a single cent of your own money to charity. I don&#x27;t know a thing about you, nor would I want to, but based on your insensitive and ignorant comment, I think we can draw some fairly accurate conclusions.<p>Secondly, Everest and the Himalaya is not the domain of millionaires. There are some millionaires that go there, for sure, but most Everest expedition members are middle class people who have saved for years and years as well as trained for years and years for a shot at Everest. People like you would love to spend $80+K on a Tesla or spend $500K on a closet-sized Bay Area condo. These people choose to spend $45K on a potentially once in a lifetime climb.<p>Do you know a single person who has climbed or attempted Everest? Nearly certainly not. There are some fools and bad apples for sure -- but you find fools and bad apples at Whole Foods or the local Fair Trade Shade Grown Coffee Establishment, Inc. as well. Perhaps you ought to get out of your shell of bitterness and head to the Himalaya yourself. Perhaps you&#x27;d find the same joy that others seek, perhaps you&#x27;d understand that climbing a mountain isn&#x27;t any more narcissistic than creating a startup or even working at one.<p>Perhaps you might even find some spiritual comfort. Himalayan climbing, for many people, is probably the closest one can get to God (or the gods, etc.) while still being upon the Earth; to minimize or insult the climbers who seek that for themselves could be compared to criticizing Muslims over the Hadj. Every climber on Everest participates in a Puja before setting foot on the mountain, showing respect to the mountain. When was the last time you showed respect for anything? Who are you to minimize the goals and dreams of people just because you don&#x27;t like what you assume to be their motivation?<p>Now, let&#x27;s address the &quot;millionaires ought to send cash&quot; malarky. Have you ever heard of the Sir Edmund Hillary Foundation? Have you visited any of the dozens of schools, hospitals or community centers in the Khumbu region paid for by those millionaires you despise? How about the Himalayan Trust? The Alex Lowe Charitable Foundation? The Juniper Fund? The Sherpa Support Fund? The International Avalanche Nest Egg Fund? ..and countless others.<p>As far as those &quot;poor&quot; people that those evil millionaires exploit to climb the Himalaya. Do you know how much they&#x27;re paid? Do you know that many climbing Sherpas have made enough money to even start their own companies, open hotels and send their kids to good universities?  Sherpa aren&#x27;t considered &quot;highly paid&quot; by western standards, but they are extremely high paid by Nepali standards.<p>Perhaps spend a few minutes researching and reading something other than Outside magazine or the other sensationalist nonsense about Everest, perhaps you&#x27;d gain a deeper understanding of what actually happens over there. Better yet, buy a ticket and go see (and volunteer) for yourself. Maybe go read Alan Arnette&#x27;s blog and get educated about Everest from a source other than ones that are trying to sell clicks or copies.",1429971948

That is, the drives were left out of sync and booting from one of the drives wouldn&#x27;t work properly if the other failed. The thing that really concerned us wasn&#x27;t so much the specific details here but that this was essentially a <i>silent</i> failure in the upgrade process, combined with a potentially <i>catastrophic</i> failure in a basic system function as a result.<p>I think there is quite a big difference between the theory of updating a couple of sources files and running a couple of upgrade commands and the practice of manually checking things like basic RAID configuration and reinstalling missing bootloader updates. This time around, the fact that Jessie uses systemd made the discussion for whether to even try a dist-upgrade a very short one, because literally everyone in the room agreed that the probability of failures was too high for that strategy to be worth considering. The substantial discussions were more about migration to fresh machines relatively soon vs. sticking with 7 at least until we know the LTS situation.",1429971863

My hunch is that people&#x27;s criteria for finding a restaurant are more nuanced than simply &#x27;[finding] a place to eat&#x27;, or a place that serves food. They may want to find a place with Thai food that&#x27;s affordable, or an American restaurant with vegan options that rarely has a wait, or a pizza place open at 11pm within walking distance of   the job they&#x27;re walking home from.<p>Last, there are 26,000 restaurants in New York City. For people living in metropolitan areas, there are many options from which to choose. Fortunate people are not living in survival mode or using apps to seek minimum means of shelter (nod to Maslow and his hierarchy). The drivers in decision-making are more complex and could be a careful balance of any number of factors, such as convenience, speed, cost, acceptance, mood and so on.<p>Add in entertainment, parks, museums, music venues, activities, and so forth - and personalized local search becomes increasingly valuable.

In some ways, small housing shares similarities with minimum wage: just because the economy is such that without a legal minimum wage, adults would still be willing to work for $4, doesn&#x27;t mean we ought to allow it and let the market figure it out. People will get exploited. Similarly, the government needs to set building standards, including the minimum space a home ought to have, in my opinion (I just happen to think it can be quite small, if properly built, for certain people).

This is one of the main reasons why I enjoyed Guild Wars 2.<p>However I&#x27;d like to add that the scale-down isn&#x27;t at all that dramatic! I can kill a Moa or a bandit in Queensdale with 2-3 hits on my level 80 Mesmer (and he is a condition-based build), while it takes much more effort as a level 3 Thief.<p>Also the traits, and gear stats remain, to an extent; they are maybe scaled down but they are still present.<p>Furthermore, it also depends on the class you&#x27;re playing. If you&#x27;re a heavy-armour character with attack-centric stats you&#x27;ll easily 1-hit anything, but if you&#x27;re a healer engineer, you&#x27;ll need to invest more effort.",1429970583

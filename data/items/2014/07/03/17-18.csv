7984625,comment,7982848,7984161,7,0,btilly,,,"The difference between an employee and an investor is that the investor puts their eggs in many baskets, and an employee puts all of their eggs in one basket.  So investors get diversification of risk while employees do not.  Therefore consistently accepting low probability but potentially high return choices on average works out well for investors and not for employees.  And in fact investors push this way - their incentive is always to &quot;swing for the fences&quot; because their business model is based on the one or two investments that work out which pay for the failures.<p>If you are considering working for a startup, the value of your equity should not be a primary consideration.  Instead you should be so deciding because you enjoy the fact that the organization is small, you can have an impact, competence can result in rapid promotion, you have the opportunity to learn many skills.  If you want to be in it for THOSE reasons, then seriously consider it.<p>When you are in any negotiation you should make all decisions about equity from the point of view of never expecting it to be worth a dime - because it probably won&#x27;t be - but be ready to trade salary in excess of your actual needs for it because you recognize that the person on the other side is trying to reward you, and rewarding people like you with money makes the company less likely to succeed.<p>If you work from those principles, then you are likely to choose a job which is a good fit and where you have a good impact.  If you instead work from everything as a straightforward economic transaction then startups can&#x27;t consistently reward you like an established company will.<p>But I can see you jumping up and down about the potential payoff from equity.  If you are a person whose day to day life can be motivated by that, then go off and read <a href=""http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/2009/11/04/is-it-time-for-you-to-earn-or-to-learn/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/2009/11/04/is-it-time-for...</a> and decide whether you are ready to start your own company now, or want to gain skills before doing it in a bit.  Seriously, the difference between &quot;last founder&quot; and &quot;first employee&quot; is so huge that people who can derive their day to day motivation from equity should be founders.<p>(Obligatory disclaimer: I have worked for a number of startups, been paid out non-life changing amounts more than once, and have never tried being a founder.)",1404410380

The first would be the basic mechanism for creating the plugin, walking the node, and doing the text conversion, which would just be a function you could pass in. Then it would have a build step to make Chrome and FireFox extensions.<p>Or maybe you would want to pass in a series of regexp replacement pairs there, but even that is too limiting, I think.

7984615,comment,7982848,7984161,1,0,tomp,,,"The risk profiles and the investment profiles of most investors are completely different from those of most employees, so there is no way that equity has (proportionally) the same value for employees and investors.<p>Besides what other comments already mentioned (liquidation preferences and portfolio diversification), one must also take into account that (1) investor&#x27;s equity is safe, while the employee&#x27;s isn&#x27;t (if you&#x27;re fired before the vesting begins), and (2) investors have much more say at influencing the company&#x27;s future (via more board seats and more voting rights). Also, most employees have much less capital than investors, so the monetary equivalent of the NPV of equity would be much more meaningful to them than to the investors (given that most people are risk-averse).<p>All in all, as an employee, I would value equity between 4-10 times less than the investors would.",1404410286
7984614,comment,7982848,7984161,2,0,cgriswald,,,"Okay, so let&#x27;s look at it as an investment.<p>Take an established company. If you invest in this company and it has problems, not only could your investment vanish, but you may also be out of a job. There&#x27;s a lot of risk there for you as an employee that isn&#x27;t there for the average investor. To me it seems the thing to do is accept the options but cash them as soon as possible while still being smart about it.<p>Take a startup. You have the same problem as above, but the startup is much, much more likely to fail and those failures are likely to be more catastrophic. If you&#x27;re not comfortable with that level of risk you just shouldn&#x27;t do it at all.  If you are, then I think you have to take the same approach as with the established company: sell as soon as you are able to sell.<p>And this is, in fact, what my ex and I did. She worked for a startup. She received options when she started and as bonuses. We were given a few liquidation opportunities (stocks sold to private investors through the company) but otherwise were not allowed to sell while she still worked there. During those opportunities we sold the maximum we were allowed to sell (which was always some percentage of our holdings).<p>This got our money out of the high risk investment and doing other things. In the long run, the company ended up going public and we could have done much better by holding out, but we still did quite well and reducing our risk at the time was the smart move.<p>I am not a financial advisor, this is not advice, blah blah blah...",1404410281

7984605,comment,7978410,7984016,2,0,bachmeier,,,"&quot;I guess my biggest concern is the viability of pursuing a PhD in economics without having a previous degree in econ.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s hard to say without knowing more about your background, but many have done it before. A degree in econ is useful but by no means necessary.<p>You should probably worry more about your math training (have you taken real analysis or another course with real proofs?) than your econ training. I had three calculus classes and linear algebra. The first week of classes the professors were talking about quasiconcavity and the Bellman equation. I was lost. I worked 80-90 hours a week the first year in order to catch up.<p>&quot;Also, it seems to me that the general market for energy economists is very strong, and will remain that way for quite some time. Do you think that&#x27;s accurate?&quot;<p>I have no specific data, but yeah, the market for economists in most fields is strong. Our program is not highly ranked, yet almost all of our PhD&#x27;s are able to get tenure track jobs with reasonable teaching loads. To my knowledge environmental/energy policy is a hot field right now, particularly if you can bring in grants.<p>&quot;as far as I can tell economics is the field that most closely aligns with this in the context of energy and the environment&quot;<p>You should also consider PhD programs in agricultural economics or environmental economics. Highly-ranked economics programs often have a theoretical/mathematical focus that doesn&#x27;t fit with what you want to do.

A flood of Mexican and Canadian immigrants enter the country to become the new middle and lower classes.

These cash-rich Americans take advantage of the fact that local prices elsewhere can&#x27;t change to compensate for their newfound wealth.

In 1916, Henry Ford owned 58% of the stock of Ford Motor Co. The Dodge brothers owned 10%. The remainder was owned by five other individuals. Beginning in 1908, Ford Motor paid a regular annual dividend of $1.2 million. Between 1911 and 1915 Ford Motor also regularly paid huge “special dividends,” totaling over $40 million. In 1916, Henry Ford announced that the company would stop paying special dividends. Instead, the firm’s financial resources would be devoted to expanding its business. Ford also continued the company’s policy of lowering prices, while improving quality. The Dodge brothers sued, asking the court to order Ford Motor to resume paying the special dividends and to enjoin the proposed expansion of the firm’s operations. At trial, Ford testified to his belief that the company made too much money and had an obligation to benefit the public and the firm’s workers and customers.<p>The plaintiff Dodge brothers contended an improper altruism towards his workers and customers motivated Ford.

So E1 = probability of a sale where your type of stock does not get screwed * cash value of your stock in this deal. E1 is by all accounts and all advice incredibly low.<p>Now let&#x27;s look at E2 which will be the expectation value of a payout from investing your salary difference between a high paying corporate job and a startup. Let&#x27;s set this number at a safe value of $50,000/year. Invest $50k a year for 10 years in some safe stock and bond mutual funds and I bet E2 and much higher than E1.

(Again, the HN forum is an example of that conflict - being a largely business-oriented forum; surveillance technology sells... Even DuckDuckGo, a favorite startup in this community, has filters to protect us.)

If you are an ISP, and you don&#x27;t want to be liable for infringments, you have to take things down after receiving a DMCA takedown notice. The end.<p>You can put it back up after the user has followed the right procedure to challenge and assume liability themselves. I admit I&#x27;m not sure exactly what procedure the DMCA outlines for this.<p>I think what ISP&#x27;s _could_ do is facilitate user&#x27;s filing challenges more easily. But they&#x27;ve got to take it down after receiving a takedown request, that&#x27;s pretty much what the law says (or else the ISP can be sued for the copyright infringement too).<p>Theoretically you can sue someone for issuing a takedown request in bad faith.

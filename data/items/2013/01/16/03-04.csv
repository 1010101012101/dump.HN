The example is referred to as a counter example.<p>[THE CONTEXT]<p>The most reasonable interpretation of the previous commenter which I could identify was:<p>""When the public pays for knowledge to be created, it should be that the public owns the knowledge it paid for...[but it is expect that] the public that paid for it, [must] pay more and more [to use it].""<p>To restate this in the counterexample language<p>(1) 'All [things which the public pays for] are [things which the public owns]'<p>(2) 'All [things which the public owns] are [things which the public should be able to freely access and use]'<p>Which combine to produce the claim<p>(3) 'All [things which the public pays for] are [things which the public should be able to freely access and use]'<p>with ""knowledge"" being one of the things which the public pays for and so ""knowledge"" being one of the things which the people should be able to freely access and use.<p>[MY ARGUMENT]<p>In order to demonstrate the flaw in this claim as just presented#, I brought up nuclear weapons as a counter example. It is an instance of something which the public pays for but of which the public shouldn't have free access to and use of.<p>[MY POINT]<p>In order to maintain the truth of the claim the previous commenter must show that my example is not a counter example by arguing that the public should have access to/use of nuclear weapons.<p>Alternatively, they can agree that the claim as presented is false, and then perhaps provide a different argument for the conclusion that 'the public should get use of the knowledge created.'<p>---<p>I hope this clarifies the point which I am trying to make. Regretfully, the hyperbolic inclusion of nuclear weapons plays a key role my argument and so I did not remove it.<p>---<p># I acknowledge that my interpretation of the claim may not have been what the author intended. Statement (1) seems to be strongly implied by the author, but (2) is inferred. The role of the questions in my original reply was to draw out a precise explanation of what ownership entails. But certainly in the case of ""knowledge"" the person want to be able to access and use the knowledge.",1358308397

Wikipedia has fairly straightforward summaries of the history of both groups.<p>Consider this very modern-sounding quote:<p>>> <i>""For who that has understanding will suppose that the first, and second, and third day, and the evening and the morning, existed without a sun, and moon, and stars? and that the first day was, as it were, also without a sky?  And who is so foolish as to suppose that God, after the manner of a husbandman, planted a paradise in Eden, towards the east, and placed in it a tree of life, visible and palpable, so that one tasting of the fruit by the bodily teeth obtained life? and again, that one was a partaker of good and evil by masticating what was taken from the tree?  And if God is said to walk in the paradise in the evening, and Adam to hide himself under a tree, I do not suppose that anyone doubts that these things figuratively indicate certain mysteries, the history having taken place in appearance, and not literally.""</i><p>That was written by Origen of Alexandria, probably around 250 AD (part of <a href=""http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf04.vi.v.v.ii.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf04.vi.v.v.ii.html</a> ).

A prosecutor who does not think that the crime is serious enough to warrant 16 years can still offer a lower plea bargain. In Aaron's case, they may have offered 1 year in jail, making it so that by asserting his right to trial, he would be doubling his sentence to 2 years in the worst case.<p>> <i>Your solution would either require them to choose which charges to pursue and which charges to drop forever. That's fine in cases like Aaron's, but that's not something you want when you're dealing with a rapist or a murderer.</i><p>Of course I know about double jeopardy. They have to choose which charges to pursue and which to drop forever <i>sometime</i>. The problem as it stands is that charges are piled on in a shotgun approach, making it very hard for the defendant to concentrate on what they're actually fighting, and ballooning court costs. And shouldn't rapists and murders be getting charged with <i>rape</i> and <i>murder</i>, respectively? We certainly don't want punishment of rapists and murderers to rely on whether they also happened to be disturbing the peace at the time. And yeah, I'll give you that all-or-nothing is a bit harsh, which is why I said something else about being acquitted on the majority of counts would result in complete acquittal. Create a mechanism so that the prosecution <i>wants</i> to make pretty sure you're guilty of something before accusing you of it.<p>> <i>Most criminals are actually guilty; making the prosecution pay for every defense would increase the costs of the criminal justice system 1000fold</i><p>So then in the name of economics, guilty criminals don't actually have a right to a trial?

I do see it being more palatable if it only applies to non-guilty outcomes, but with the following caveats: limits increased to 2x what the prosecution spends, and the money is loaned out by the government as the case progresses and is then owed by the defendant in the event of a guilty verdict.

Retention and understanding are also dependent on how <i>well</i> you read, i.e. how deeply you focus and digest information. Plenty of people read hundreds of books each year, but read so quickly that nothing sticks. It's only when they read a title that feeds into some deep-rooted emotional issue or agrees with already-established biases that they claim ""genuis! mind-shattering!"" and so on. Could have been the case here, and I think that's the spirit behind saying ""you aren't reading enough"". It isn't always a question of volume, but rather whether or not you're actually <i>reading</i>.",1358305778

That breaks referential transparency.\n</code></pre>\nYou are right, I don't know much about the syntax of clojure, but the Scheme version works as I'd expect.  Yes, the eval calls return different results, but then again, we'd expect to compute a different output for <i>different</i> inputs.<p>What I tried to show is that calling (swapargs (swapargs '(a b c))) will always return the original list, that is, demonstrates referential transparency.  In the case of '(modulo a b), result of evaluation returns a the same result when repeatedly given the same a, b inputs.<p>The point of the macro was exchanging the second and third elements of the input list.  Naturally for the modulo operation, the order of the inputs is significant, and exchanging the operands will give the ""opposite"" remainder as the result.<p>In your example the two calls to (eval ...) are <i>not</i> identical and the ""different results"" are perfectly correct, without implications for referential transparency.<p>Don't know what kind of applications you might have in mind, but of course, no PL is optimum in all domains.  For the kinds of programs I've tackled, Lisp/Scheme has been a good fit.  Or maybe it has to do with the way my brain works just as much as the purposes I am applying the language to.

I now see that the problem is much bigger than that.<p>I think the important point that is easy to miss is that we are in the very early stages of a major social revolution, probably the biggest in human history. Institutions like the Catholic church or the NYT and the MSM (today) are what communicate and sustain the culture (whether you agreed with them or not). This is what the internet has broken. It takes time for new institutions to form but that is the process that is underway right now and that process will probably take decades.",1237744683

(all because of you, writing that recursive article...)<p>You make a very interesting point there (more than in this article, in fact, imho). My thought on it is that there is a spectrum of techniques to ""engage"" groups of people and elicit desired behaviour. Some of them work, and some of them don't. Some of them are towards the Dark Side, and some of them closer to the Light Side.<p>I think it's incorrect to suppose that only the techniques on the Dark Side work. Light Side techniques work too, but differently. And Dark Side techniques have a cost too, which is not always obvious. Raelians may be very good at generating agreement and coordinated behaviour, but what creativity do they have? The brainwashing ensures that there is little original, individual thought left.<p>For example, the technique used by your synagogue seems like a good technique, not unethical, but very effective.<p>I haven't given it too much thought, but I suspect that a good way to draw the line is to examine whether a technique merely <i>encourages</i> or whether it <i>coerces</i>.<p>Finally, do we ""atheist/libertarian/technophile/sf-fan/early-adopter/programmer/etc"" fail at organising ourselves?

My day job is advising large organizations how to run their teams like startups. I've written several web applications as startups in the past but never seemed to make it past the first stage. I've also consulted with a few startups and know their pains.<p>I also like bunnies and puppies and long walks in the park.<p>(grin)<p>Good luck to you, my friend. I've been actively seeking a cofounder for about a year. I'm not sure what the magic formula is. Perhaps it might be best to get out there, set up shop, and do some networking for a month or two.<p>As to hiring and percentage ownership and such, put your checkbook away. If you're serious about a startup, go 50-50 with whomever you hook up with. Startups are inherently risky. You need another brain that's in this struggle with you 100%, not some schmuck looking for a paycheck. Don't get me wrong -- there are great employees out there. But what you need is technical <i>vision</i>, not just technical execution. You don't know what you don't know. And employees aren't going to fix that.<p>Having said all of that, you come at this in a severe disadvantage -- you've already had a successful business. That means you're not as hungry as the average person. The next startup I'm in, I have to make it work or go back to consulting. You can always hang out for another year and see how things go. At some point, your ""runway"" can be too long. I really believe you can have too much money for this sort of thing. I'd also think about a three-person team just to balance it out and prevent deadlocks. I can't overemphasize how critical people selection are to team performance. It's critical enough in any kind of business endeavor, but in startups? Having the right folks that mix the right way is gold -- literally.<p>Hope that helps you.

Reactions to Facebook changes, and results, have actually been quite different.<p>The first big outcry was about the introduction of newsfeeds.  People were upset because Facebook sprang it on them by surprise, and suddenly information was being shared in new ways that people weren't used to, hadn't expected, and had no control over.  In the long run, newsfeeds turned out to be one of Facebook's most useful and visionary features, but they <i>did</i> make two mistakes:
1. Surprising people, causing them to realize after the fact that they'd shared information in ways they hadn't intended
2. Providing no control.  Facebook's success owes a lot to the way it offers people very granular control over their privacy and sharing.<p>Facebook fixed #2 by adding granular privacy controls for newsfeeds, and #1 just naturally fixed itself once people figured out the new system.<p>A couple of later episodes of ""everyone whines"" were different: Facebook made a big mistake, everyone complained, and Facebook backed down completely, thus quieting the criticism:<p>1. ""Beacon"", which let partners' web sites post to people's feeds (for example, you buy a book at Amazon and it appears on your feed).  Facebook pulled Beacon.  They later began reintroducing some of the more useful aspects of Beacon in limited ways, with better user control, and this has been useful.<p>2. The change to Terms of Service a few months ago.  Huge outcry, Facebook admitted their error, backed out the changes, and started work on a new terms of service to fix problems in public view with public comment.<p>Another case, and probably the one you're thinking of, was last year's profile redesign.  That time, Facebook did things right: They informed people early, and opened a group where they posted weekly mock-ups of what they were thinking and asked for comments in a managed way, and responded to the previous week's comments.  The process went for several months, and I followed it and could see how it improved the design significantly.<p>When the new design came out, some people did indeed object vocally.  But a lot of other people (me included) saw the value of it because we'd been included during the design process, and because the new design really did have a lot of advantages, which we could articulate.  This outcry took a different path than previous ones: Facebook did not have to make any changes, and instead, proponents of the new design eventually converted most of the opponents.<p>When Pages were overhauled recently in the same way as the Profile redesign from last year, there was no major outcry.<p>And now we come to this new Facebook redesign: It really is AWFUL.  They threw away all that they learned last time.  They took out most of the advantages of last year's redesign, eliminated many of the most useful features, and actually went back even further, effectively eliminating the newsfeed.  They did not include users in the redesign process, and they did not give previews or warning.<p>Your analysis is much too simplistic, and misses almost everything significant about the differences between these episodes of Facebook changes followed by objections from users, and therefore misses all of the factors that make each episode <i>different</i> from some of the others.",1237741312

187150,comment,187133,187133,0,0,reitzensteinm,,,"This could be good from the entreprenuer's point of view, but would it work for the investors? VCs want to hit home runs so they want to pour loads of cash in and take a big stake. If they minimize (optimize) funding to align with startup's expenditure, they will presumably give up equity - their profit - for cash, which they have loads of. They'll also have more overhang - unless they overcommit and invest in more companies like seats on an airline, which might result in a run on their capital!<p>From the startup's perspective, there's also the risk of the VC changing their mind with a ""we're withdrawing the rest of your funding - sue us if you want, but the lawsuit will last longer than your company can stay in business"", which would suck.<p>I'm thinking in terms of a deal, say, $1m guaranteed funding, withdraw cash as you like, equity will be priced at 5% + 1% per $100k (so the option on $1m is quite expensive). Is there another way it could be structured that would make more sense?",1210553094

- Windows Mobile (various flavours thereof)
- Android (No real hardware yet available)
- Non-Native development (J2ME et al.)<p>The best way to get started would be to download an SDK for one of these environments. They all come with emulators, so you can start playing around with writing apps without any investment in hardware.<p>I'm not from the USA, but I've spent most of my working life in the mobile industry so I believe I know what I'm talking about. In the USA, only certain places have GSM networks. This includes most of the major cities, San Fran, New York, Atlanta, LA, etc. Pretty much any Smart Phone you can buy is a GSM phone. There are a few exceptions, some of the older Palm phones were CDMA, but Palm is essentially dead now. Before you buy a new phone, just make sure your current network is a GSM network. While I understand it isn't a terribly common thing to do in the US, most developers will buy development phones unlocked direct from the manufacturer (or a reseller) and put a SIM they already own in it. In the UK, you are pretty much drowing in SIM cards. Both Orange and O2 give away pay as you talk SIM cards on a regular basis online, and I tend to grab as many as I can on each occasion, since they tend to get deactivated after a while because they sit in various of my phones not getting topped up.<p>As for what phone to buy, wanting GPS limits you a little. I'd recommend the Nokia N95 8GB as a good start. It's a Symbian S60 phone with built in GPS and WiFi.",1210552933

187143,comment,187132,187132,0,0,webwright,,,"FWIW, with RescueTime you can create whitelists of the sites you DO want to track.  Every other site will come through as ""non-whitelisted site"" (the site info never hits our servers).  You can set goals like ""spend less than 1h surfing news"" and have RescueTime SMS you when you break them.<p>But there's no solution out there that your lack of discipline won't conquer.<p>One good hack is to set it up so that you either starve or are publicly shamed when you procrastinate.  So, you could quit your job (thus putting starvation on the line!).  Or you could embed a RescueTime graph on your blog and invite people to hassle you about how you spend your time. ;-)",1210552727

187132,story,,,44,52,bobp,"Ask YC: How do you avoid wasting too much time online?",,"I spend too much time browsing the web and it's hurting my productivity. There are so many interesting sites online -- hacker news, blogs, friendfeed, facebook, nytimes, etc -- and it's hard for me resist checking them on a daily basis, often multiple times a day. This stuff is really interesting and often useful, especially for an entrepreneurial hacker, and that makes it easy to justify spending so much time to ""stay on top of things"". However, the opportunity cost of not coding for an hour is huge compared to the benefit of reading yet another ""20 things every startup founder should know"" article. I need to find a way to break this bad habit. Just being aware of it apparently isn't enough.<p>I tried 8aweek. It didn't work for me. I've conditioned myself to reflexively press the ""10 more minutes"" button when the ""your break time is up"" popup comes up. Plus, at home I use Safari, and 8aweek doesn't work on Safari. (I avoided RescueTime -- the privacy implications are too creepy for me. Maybe I would use it if it had the option for only data collection. Also, I <i>know</i> I have a time wasting problem -- I don't need RescueTime to tell me that.)<p>The best solution I've found so far is to go somewhere where I don't have an internet connection at all, but it's not always practical.<p>If you have the same problem, how do you deal with it?

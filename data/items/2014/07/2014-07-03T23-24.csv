P.\n  Martin, a math-loving executive at Canadian Tire, decided to analyze almost\n  every piece of information his company had collected from credit-card\n  transactions the previous year. Canadian Tire’s stores sold electronics,\n  sporting equipment, kitchen supplies and automotive goods and issued a credit\n  card that could be used almost anywhere. Martin could often see precisely what\n  cardholders were purchasing, and he discovered that the brands we buy are the\n  windows into our souls — or at least into our willingness to make good on our\n  debts. His data indicated, for instance, that people who bought cheap, generic\n  automotive oil were much more likely to miss a credit-card payment than someone\n  who got the expensive, name-brand stuff. People who bought carbon-monoxide\n  monitors for their homes or those little felt pads that stop chair legs from\n  scratching the floor almost never missed payments. Anyone who purchased a\n  chrome-skull car accessory or a “Mega Thruster Exhaust System” was pretty likely\n  to miss paying his bill eventually.\n  \n  Martin’s measurements were so precise that he could tell you the “riskiest”\n  drinking establishment in Canada — Sharx Pool Bar in Montreal, where 47 percent\n  of the patrons who used their Canadian Tire card missed four payments over 12\n  months. He could also tell you the “safest” products — premium birdseed and a\n  device called a “snow roof rake” that homeowners use to remove high-up\n  snowdrifts so they don’t fall on pedestrians.\n</code></pre>\n<a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/17/magazine/17credit-t.html?pagewanted=all"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/17/magazine/17credit-t.html?p...</a>",1404431409

With this ebook you go from zero to a little application in the Firefox Marketplace.<p>https://leanpub.com/quickguidefirefoxosdevelopment/<p>I created this to give away at hackathons and hack days because the Mozilla docs were spread all over the developer hub, mdn and the wiki so it was hard for new developers to find what they needed.<p>The guide has been quite successful and has about 8.000 readers right now counting the Portuguese and English versions. I am currently finishing a new book that is focused on teaching game development for Firefox OS, this will also be free and open source. There is a hotsite at leanpub about it: https://leanpub.com/buildinggamesforfirefoxos/ you can register to receive the updates about the release.<p>For those that would like what other books related to this new platform are available on the web I created a site devoted to Firefox OS books at http://firefoxosbooks.org<p>We at the Mozilla Community believe that the Web is an important public resource that should be protected and evolved. Firefox OS is a step in bringing the powers and freedoms of the Web to the mobile ecosystem. It has a huge potential and I could go for hours about why it matters. I hope this book will help people curious about developing for the platform.<p>Cheers",1404431357

Also you avoided addressed why a service would act against their own users in such a way, even if the perceived risk is small.

It&#x27;s a specific tactic with a specific objective: to force the person you&#x27;re talking to to admit that a thesis they had believed up to that point is false, by making them prove it false for themselves. But to use this method successfully, you have to pick your targets: you don&#x27;t use it unless you already know, in advance, that step 3 can be reached, which means you already know, in advance, that the person will <i>not</i> be able to head you off during the process. That knowledge is what makes you smarter than the other person.<p>It&#x27;s worth noting, btw, that most of what we know about Socrates, and practically all of what we know about how he used this method, comes from Plato&#x27;s dialogues, which portray Socrates as having a very high success rate with his method. We don&#x27;t know how accurately Plato represented that aspect of things; the real Socrates might not have been as consistently successful at using the method as the character Socrates in the dialogues. My comments are really about the character Socrates; they are only about the real Socrates to the extent that the character accurately represents what he did and how well he did it.",1404431250

I&#x27;ve heard from individuals supposedly familiar with payments systems in stores and payment processing that many big chains have a level 3 credit card processing system in place for consumer purchases.<p>One part of level 3 processing is a line item list of what was purchased. So if it is true that there are stores using a payment system that routinely transmits level 3 information for consumer purchases then it would follow that the credit card processor does currently have the information on exactly what you are buying from those particular stores (not just the merchant and the total amount).<p>I just did a quick minute or two of web searching and didn&#x27;t see a trustworthy looking link describing the practice of level 3 card processing for consumer purchases.

An obvious exception are radio telescopes which do passive tracking, but will check their pointing on a bright source periodically.<p>Second, the sky is very bright and variable in the infrared, so the dominant source of noise is from the sky. For this reason, you take an image on source followed shortly by an image off source to use to subtract the background sky from the on-source image. As the infrared sky can vary quite quickly, you want to sample the background quite often. If there is a &quot;blank&quot; patch of sky near enough to your target, this is accomplished by &quot;chopping&quot; the secondary mirror back and forth between the source and the off position. This occurs at frequencies on the order of 1Hz, so exposures are less than a second. If you have to move further to find &quot;blank&quot; sky, it is accomplished by &quot;nodding&quot; the telescope, i.e. moving the primary to the off position. This takes a bit longer and may only be done every ~30s.<p>Because there is active guiding, there is no issue co-adding an arbitrarily large number of these images, and observations can actually be several hours long. And, because the background sky varies fairly rapidly, stacking short exposures (with the background subtracted) will actually give better noise performance than taking long exposures.",1404430359

If I really want to hear that one old song, I can pull it up on youtube without having to build a library.  My music tastes are easily satisfied with Creative Commons music or free streaming, even without subscribing.  There is such a surplus of music available with how cheap it has gotten to produce.  Music labels are in big trouble as they have to compete with hobbyists.  They&#x27;re being marginalized both in the production and distribution end.<p>But I don&#x27;t see that same level of hobbyist quality TV.  The business has changed a lot of TV, but only in distribution, not the production.  Red vs Blue was a decade ago and little has built on that model since.  Maybe Dr Horrible&#x27;s Sing-Along-Blog could be considered a hobby project, but it was done by big name stars.  The only real hobby video we have now is just game-streaming and sketch comedy skits.",1404429214

The same person with the same car can go to the same location twice for an oil change & get two different prices.<p>I know because I&#x27;ve had it happen to me. The price differed by a few dollars, but still. Take it one step further & any shop that&#x27;s established will have tools built specific to them where they can charge whatever they want on a sliding scale. Go to STS Tire in a nice, fancy area. Ask for a quote on a particular service. Note the price. Ask for the same work to be done in an impoverished area & ask for the same work to be done. The price will be radically different, especially if the shop owner isn&#x27;t greedy.<p>I think you&#x27;re on to something, I just think it would take a substantial amount of work but figuring out how to do that in the most efficient way to collect all those data points makes everything easier.

I can’t figure out any logical reason to block people from accessing (and paying!) for your apps and content if they happen to be elsewhere.<p>To give you an example why this makes sense:<p>One of our apps uses local dialin numbers to allow our customers to make cheap calls to foreign countries.<p>Since we do not have local dialin numbers in every single country, we limit the access to those countries.<p>If we didn&#x27;t limit the access the app would either be useless to some customers, or useless AND very expensive (if for example a US customer routed via German dialin number to his destination)<p>So to me, this is a feature, you often just don&#x27;t have the information about the technical or regulatory reasons why an app is restricted.",1391878649
7201696,comment,7196494,7201532,1,0,FooBarWidget,,,"OpenBSD only has a small number of precompiled packages, and usually extremely outdated. If you want to get <i>anything</i> useful you have to compile ports. As for the question of whether Linux being widespread is due to marketing or quality: that is completely irrelevant. The fact that Linux <i>is</i> more widespread is all that matters. We don&#x27;t live in a theoretical world where only theoretical technical superiority is the only thing that matters.<p>You are right, no management and administration tool is more superior than the Unix command line. The thing is, Puma&#x27;s Unix command line tooling is almost nonexistant. <i>All</i> of Passenger&#x27;s management and administration tools are command line tools.<p>You are also correct in that you don&#x27;t need fancy software to do things for you when you can do all that stuff yourself. It&#x27;s a bit like saying that Docker has no added value because you can setup LXC yourself. But it&#x27;s not hard to imagine why so many people do find value in Docker.<p>As for spam: yes you are right, there have been times in the past when we were overly eager with promotion. I apologize for that, and we&#x27;ve since adjusted our strategy.<p>Having said that, our claims have always only been based on facts. For example: how do I find out what requests my Puma processes are currently handling, and how long they&#x27;ve been active? Where are the tools to query that information?",1391878637

The point of a company soliciting user feedback is for them to gather information about what people who use their product want, so that they can make better decisions.

If you shut down example.com and they go out and buy example.net and point it back to their website, the registrar would be obliged to do the same thing with example.net, would they not?<p>Moreover, the ability to get another name is kind of the point: Evaluate the two possible alternatives. On one hand, say it&#x27;s easy to disseminate the new name (or your IP address) to everyone you may want to communicate with. Then taking away the domain name is ineffective to prevent the alleged misconduct, so there is no reason to do it. On the other hand, suppose that it&#x27;s difficult to let everyone know the new name. That presents the other problem: A million people come to example.com and you have a platform where you can tell them what&#x27;s going on and why the accusations against you are false; replace example.com with a page of unproven allegations against you and now your audience has no way to hear your side of the story because they don&#x27;t know where to find you.<p>> If I was renting to you, and found out you were cooking and distributing meth in the house, I would evict you. That would not mean you could never live in a house again, just that you can&#x27;t do your crime on my property.<p>I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re distinguishing between what you&#x27;re <i>allowed</i> to do and what the law <i>obliges</i> you to do. If you evict someone because you don&#x27;t want to rent to a meth cook then that&#x27;s all well and good, they can go live somewhere else and rent from someone else. But if the law prohibits anyone from renting to someone thought to be a meth cook then where is an accused meth cook supposed to live?",1391878438

Good products have friendly, warm, inviting copy.<p>You could spin it around by turning it to 11, and call it something like &quot;Speedsums for assholes&quot;. Then you could insult the user at every opportunity you get, using over the top curses in a tongue in cheek manner (&quot;4 seconds to solve that? My guinea pig did better!&quot;). If it&#x27;s clear that it&#x27;s meant in a satirical way, it&#x27;d be less shocking. However, this is much harder to pull off in a way that is funny and stays funny over time.<p>So either make a product with clean, friendly copy - or make one that does the &quot;evil coach&quot; to the maximum.

Like markdown it uses simple, semantic tags to create a plain text file that can be transformed into something more complex such as HTML, saving the compiler the job of managing complex code.<p>It is designed as an intermediary language but it is hoped it can be a publishing language in its own right.<p>It can handle any type of book, from simple novels to very complex textbooks. Although similar to markdown it has a number of features to cope with the specific demands of book publishing:<p>1. The table of contents is compiled automatically using a simple, intuitive method;<p>2. No footnotes or endnotes;<p>3. Structural components unique to books are included e.g. scene breaks and page breaks;<p>4. Complex elements are included e.g. tables, links, images and indexes;<p>5. The final file is just a zip file; the manuscript is a plain text file.<p>UBook is a not-for-profit, open project designed to solve a problem. It simplifies the production of ebooks, and focuses on a universal method of doing so. It is at a pre-release stage, and I would welcome any insights you have to offer.<p>If you have an interest in ePublishing, web languages, HTML, markdown etc. please do check it out.",1391878346

If you can protect yourself from exposure to it when you&#x27;re vulnerable, then you should consider doing so.<p>For instance, Japan has long copyright terms. Copyright extends to the end of the life of the author plus fifty years. But the EU has ludicrous copyright terms that are at least 20 years longer. Copyright in the USA is permanent (technically, the congress has to comply with Disney&#x27;s lobbying every 20 years to keep extending it, but the vote is unanimous). So there&#x27;s a lot of material .jp servers and apps might want to offer you that&#x27;s illegal in the EU or USA.<p>Even worse than that, the USA has a patent system where in app purchase is covered by dozens of patents, online backup or storage is covered by thousands of patents, basic common UI elements are almost all patented, and so on. You can&#x27;t write even a trivial app without either infringing or buying millions of dollars in licenses. App authors just have to be comfortable with infringing and accepting effectively unlimited liability.<p>Well, okay, I guess it is silly and crazy, but it&#x27;s not the fault of Google or app publishers.

And more, that anyone not willing to listen is not a friend.<p>The sad part is that without the drama, they wouldn&#x27;t really know how to connect to others. To someone who enjoys the notion of seeming supportive, compassionate, these ne&#x27;er-do-wells offer a unique opportunity to give constantly - one gives time, attention, advice, support, and it just disappears down a deep, dark well.<p>This is where &quot;assistance&quot; crosses over into &quot;enablement&quot;. The most compassionate thing you can do is cut such a person off, and force them to deal with their drama on their own. They may feel isolated at first, alone, friendless. They will feel helpless and unable to solve their problems. But that feeling of helplessness <i>is</i> their primary problem - and it&#x27;s not true. The human mind, every human mind, is powerful. In the depths of their despair, they can and will discover their agency in this world, and more often than not will emerge from their isolation with a newfound strength with which they may be able to <i>participate</i> in a relationship, rather than just <i>consume</i> the goodwill of others.<p>It may seem like self-serving advice, as listening to someone endlessly speak of their fears, doubts, injustices, etc is frustrating and annoying. But it is far worse for them - you only endure it on occasion, but this litany of negativity is <i>constantly</i> rolling around in their head. The real motivation of talking to you is that talking to you will get the words out of their head and make them stop. They aren&#x27;t looking for advice, just the chance of a brief respite from the incessantly negative thinking. This is the same way in which drug users start using the drugs just to get a brief respite from the pain of not doing the drug. And the solution is the same: stop using, go through the horrible pain of withdrawal, and claim your dignity as human being. Then rejoice together, as real friends do.",1391877128

Without defined goals, a review is pointless.<p>The last time I worked as a permanent employee, yearly appraisals were built out of three factors:<p>a) Performance against defined goals.<p>b) Helping the company meet its social programme.<p>c) Moving the company forward.<p>... with the last two undefined. People could go into their appraisal with all their defined goals met, only to be told they&#x27;d only got 1/3 of what was needed.<p>Just before I left they changed it again to stress they wanted everyone to go above and beyond, so simply meeting your objectives would in future get a &quot;progressing&quot; result, which was below average. There was, literally, no way to guarantee a favourable result without playing politics.<p>That said, however, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d like the solution where the system just works better. My ideal solution would be to have no annual goals or targets at all (which is the position I&#x27;m in currently as a contractor).<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s an understatement to say that my opinion is that metrics are amongst the most evil things ever invented in the corporate world, and frequently the root of all trouble.<p>In case that seems a hyperbolic statement, I&#x27;m thinking for example of the sub-prime issues which almost brought down the world financial systems and was in my opinion caused by the needs of some managers to put sales figures above ethics to make their yearly targets.",1391875579

Being a manuscript from Mexico, it wouldn&#x27;t be surprising if it had eluded many researchers, who often have an European-centric background. In Brazil there are also manuscripts in the native&#x27;s, non-written language (tupi) codified by catholic priests dating back to XVI, but those are better understood because the language was kept alive up to the late XIX.

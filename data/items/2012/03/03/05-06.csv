As someone who works in this space (building hospitals) we see a lot of trending movement to the iPad, though I question the longevity of PDFs.<p>We have a software suite for the construction industry, which has modules for inspection requests, punch-lists, occupancy planning (healthcare), room completion (healthcare), room readiness (healthcare) etc.<p>We also have a service around providing custom reports... however, we find that the need for dynamic data trumps the ability to simply view the latest plan digitally, i.e. we provide the ability to run a dynamic report on all inspections scheduled, performed, outstanding, etc... As well as the need to run a report that would ""Show me all the rooms that have a Medication Dispensation Unit, on level two and assigned to unit Med Surge"" - which outputs a colorized visio (or ZUI iPad floorplan).<p>The future is in granularity of reporting, rather than just blanket display, and I think this is a great step. Especially if you have many trades begining to use it. There is no reason the trades can't run multiple apps for specific purposes.<p>Although, I am not sure I agree with one number in the article; ""For $1MM in construction, you can have as much as $3,500 in printing"" -- I am only skeptical as I work on projects in the hundreds of millions (1.5B, 850MM, 800MM 100MM are the budgets for my (personally) active projects) I dont see them spending 3MM on printing for the 850MM project... but I might just not be privy to the numbers from every trade.<p>Here is an example of a dynamic room category report for an active project here in SF. We colorize the rooms based on type/use to familiarize the org with the spaces <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/2DRah.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/2DRah.jpg</a> - We do a great deal more with the data and reports, this is just an example of many that the orgs use. Hospital transition planning is very complex, and costly. The vitals of the facility change a lot through the life of the project. The issue with educating THOUSANDS of people in prep for opening day such that they can SAFELY receive their first patient is critical.<p>Being able to very quickly synthesize and summarize vast amounts of information makes for a better, more successful project and a better, more educated and prepared staff.<p>Remember that while there are hundreds of people on a project team, there are thousands of people on the facility staff who are expected to move into the facility day-one and not cause fatal mistakes.<p>A project I am doing in Texas is 1.5MM square feet and dynamic, item-level granularity reporting is going to be key in the smooth success of the project.<p>I would love to see what PlanGrid can offer such large projects - and while I am a full proponent of the iPad in the field, in an industry where cost is king, I'd like to better understand how they convince construction companies of the ROI - esp. when tools and materials walk of the job all the time.<p>I think that Plangrid should talk to the designers (not just architects) as well; RTKL, Mazzetti, TEECOM, RLS, SMWM, SFM, etc...<p>If PlanGrid (love the name) wants to talk to me - my email is in my profile.",1330752072

It will let people remember important events and moments in there lives. It will trigger one of the strongest human emotions. So I don't like to think of my app as a photo app, it provides a token, a window into someone's past. Do you see what I am saying? It will be a very tough app to make, and will only work if I do it right. But that is my goal, and hopefully I can achieve it.",1330751524

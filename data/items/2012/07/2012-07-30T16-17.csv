Denmark invested heavily in wind. It created one of the biggest windmill companies in the world.<p>It did all the right things. Took it to the stock market allowed normal people to invest in it, created lots of new jobs and the stock surged in the early zeros.<p>Today stock is struggling and most of the jobs have been outsourced to other countries much less expensive to produce in.<p>The windmill technology in itself is not hi-tech but ""low-tech"" so there isn't even som IP that the Danes benefit from.<p>The only customers worth talking about is countries and there is no revolution in efficiency happening.<p>My guess is that wind will be surpassed by other more beneficial technologies.<p>So the lesson: Alternative energy as we know it right now is far from being a solution to the problems we have.

This is not an original idea but I wonder if it gets enough notice. I would argue this problem is worse in the West (at least this seems to be in line with my own experience).<p>It doesn't take much to put together the pieces. With increasing affluence, parents were given a greater opportunity to protect their children from the realities of life. It is clear that children are not always capable of facing real life challenges. However, the age for just when they are ready for many of them, seemed to gradually shift further and further. (Something that was no doubt encouraged by the longer periods of time required to complete the education for many vocations.)<p>Until we arrive at the present day. Teenagers are more or less assumed to be parasites on society, incapable of true contribution to it. Until, that is, they are magically transformed at the arbitrarily chosen 18 year mark into full fledged members of society.<p>I would argue that all this impacts how we teach kids in schools today. Instead of introducing them to truely independently useful skills, there is an uspoken rule that they aren't actually capable of anything useful just yet. Instead we play pretend, teach them some ideas that might one day lead to something useful, and expect they'll be satisfied with the experience. Highschools often cram kids' heads full of mundane method after mundane method, with little explanation as to how they work or why they are relevant. There is a litany of seemingly random factoids to be memorised. Abstract thinking is a lofty skill reserved for the adults and we needn't waste our time trying to evoke anything of the sort with these kids.<p>So yes, in a way I think our expectations of what our kids are capable of, do need to change. Not only on a superficial level where we just get them to work harder within the existing broken system. But a new approach is required where their full potential can be challenged.<p>It's easy to make such grandiose sweeping statements of course, but I maintain one of the keys is not stopping short with purely theoretical methods but extending them to practical realities. Yes, that is more challenging. Let's stop assuming that the challenge is out of grasp for these young people.",1343666467

You know, for histograms and stuff like that.  So you make the largest bucket max_int or 999 in this easy scenario, and the number of buckets precisely 1/3 the number of buckets or 333 in this easy case, and postgres database will figure out the number of the bucket to stick your sample into, which coincidentally happens to numerically match 1/3 the sample.<p>Its possible Oracle has a function similar to width_bucket from postgres, but I have no idea because a Oracle license costs about 10 times the value of my house so I can't afford it, probably because they pay people to reimplement /.<p>Another fun way to attack this problem would be to go all trig on them and try to convince them its impossible to divide by 3 because you can't trisect an angle using classical greek construction techniques.

I think it just opened my mind to more avenues of attacking problems.<p>After hallucinating to a point where your thoughts influence your vision, you have a different relationship with perception. It's not something easily explained to people that have not gone through a similar same experience.<p>When on any sort of hallucinogen I never though I could solve math problems or computer problems.  Quite the opposite really, I was almost useless at the computer and getting simple things like running winamp's screensaver seemed like a chore. The mind is easily distracted and literally thinks at speeds that is above average.  I remember playing Dead or Alive and being able to literally see the game moving in slow motion and completely kicking the computers ass.  Under normal circumstances I was never as good.<p>The whole idea being, experiencing a different reality opens the mind to a whole different set of possibilities.  Things like what is a memory?

It bugs me in any case that yum wasn't warning you that it had already installed `cabal-install`.<p>It is probably something very simple but would be much easier to figure out in real time, e.g. on the #haskell irc channel which generally handles such difficulties promptly. E.g. does a look at `ghc-pkg list` and `ghc-pkg check` suggest that something was broken?<p>(By the way, the comparison with Ruby and Python and Perl and Node is not that great; cabal is as much, or more, like `make` than `gem`, managing compilation, linking etc.; one uses it all the time locally where distribution is not in question; it looks like that is the aspect that you are bumping into.)",1343665975

4313093,comment,4312731,4312731,102,0,reustle,,,"Copying the text just incase FB decides they don't like it<p>---<p>Hey everyone, we're going to be deleting our Facebook page in the next couple of weeks, but we wanted to explain why before we do. A couple months ago, when we were preparing to launch the new Limited Run, we started to experiment with Facebook ads. Unfortunately, while testing their ad system, we noticed some very strange things. Facebook was charging us for clicks, yet we could only verify about 20% of them actually showing up on our site. At first, we thought it was our analytics service. We tried signing up for a handful of other big name companies, and still, we couldn't verify more than 15-20% of clicks. So we did what any good developers would do. We built our own analytic software. Here's what we found: on about 80% of the clicks Facebook was charging us for, JavaScript wasn't on. And if the person clicking the ad doesn't have JavaScript, it's very difficult for an analytics service to verify the click. What's important here is that in all of our years of experience, only about 1-2% of people coming to us have JavaScript disabled, not 80% like these clicks coming from Facebook. So we did what any good developers would do. We built a page logger. Any time a page was loaded, we'd keep track of it. You know what we found? The 80% of clicks we were paying for were from bots. That's correct. Bots were loading pages and driving up our advertising costs. So we tried contacting Facebook about this. Unfortunately, they wouldn't reply. Do we know who the bots belong too? No. Are we accusing Facebook of using bots to drive up advertising revenue. No. Is it strange? Yes. But let's move on, because who the bots belong to isn't provable.<p>While we were testing Facebook ads, we were also trying to get Facebook to let us change our name, because we're not Limited Pressing anymore. We contacted them on many occasions about this. Finally, we got a call from someone at Facebook. They said they would allow us to change our name. NICE! But only if we agreed to spend $2000 or more in advertising a month. That's correct. Facebook was holding our name hostage. So we did what any good hardcore kids would do. We cursed that piece of shit out! Damn we were so pissed. We still are. This is why we need to delete this page and move away from Facebook. They're scumbags and we just don't have the patience for scumbags.<p>Thanks to everyone who has supported this page and liked our posts. We really appreciate it.

Critically analyzing a piece of literature is similar to deconstruction a programming puzzle. It involves finding patterns & relations between characters and events. It involves summarizing and breaking your ideas in sections.<p>Even for something as ridiculously subjective as art, you can still have a formalized course. Ask students to set a goals or make a proposal of what they want to accomplish, then grade them on how well they accomplished that.<p>> Back in college I remember some of the humanities profs were known to be liberal and others were conservative.<p>In my American college (certainly a mediocre school, not a fancy shmancy Ivy League) I had most professors behave rationally. Even the super liberal feminist professors graded fairly those that wrote  well research and well-thought out paper. So that is mostly about bad professors than it is necessarily about some fundamental flaw in the subjects.<p>On anther level I agree.

I'm leaving it for the use of the term ""lying culture"", which I think is real and is a useful summary term.<p>Negotiating such circumstances continues to be a struggle, for me.  To the extent my opinion has any value, though, I would recommend being on the lookout for becoming part of or involved with a ""lying culture"" and getting out of such circumstances as soon as possible.<p>As I stated, in my case I compensated.  For me, that seemed to end up being a self-destructive approach.<p>Several bad personal circumstances perhaps kept me more ""trapped"" than I might otherwise have been -- if it was not just personal weakness.  Regardless, from that perspective, my recommendation is to walk away.  The sooner you do so, the less it's going to cost you.  And you won't be further empowering those who are shoveling the shit.<p>--<p>I started a longer comment, but I'm going to reduce it to the phrase I used within it:  A lying culture.<p>A lying culture is corrosive, and it is particularly damaging to those who don't lie and aren't interested in the priorities such a culture tends to emphasize.  (Personal power, control, and exploitation.)<p>I've managed to negotiate some such cultures, in good part by finding and connecting with the decent sub-population within them.  Sometimes that included winning the trust of somewhat disengaged employees over to my cause.<p>However, negotiating such a culture for a time does not equate with long term success.  I think, in retrospect, it is better to get out.  Personal connections can mask, but not counteract, the larger influences.<p>It is also worth keeping a keen ear tuned to if and when your work culture starts turning into a lying culture.<p>Those ""stay the course"", ""engagement"", et al. memos can be one canary, and if you're paying attention, you'll observe some of the brightest employees -- where their personal investments and risks aren't too high -- jumping ship soon after the scent of such a change begins wafting around.<p>It is, I think, not just about personal opportunity.

When they hear ""FWIW, Poland and the USA get very similar results from their K-12 systems"" they can say ""Oh good for Poland. This used to be a communist country and now it is as good as US in Education"" or they can also say ""Holy crap. America is now on par with an Eastern European country that was ruled by communists just couple of decades ago, how sad, we could do some much better"".<p>Now, note, I don't endorse this binary view. I want all the countries to have good education, especially my country.<p>Also, I grew up in Eastern Europe and can also say that my high-school education there emphasized math, physics, literature and English (or other foreign language) a lot more than my American high-school (I also went to an American high-school for a one year btw, so I can compare a bit). I came to US in the 10th grade and was taking math courses along with high-school seniors and tutoring them. I was only above average at home in those subjects.<p>Overall, what I think works well for US high-schools:<p>* Kids have a choice already to specialize because they can each take an individualized curriculum. Some took more literature and English some took more physics. That's great.<p>* Frequent and objective testing. A lot of objective testing and quizzes. Keeps you on pace.<p>* More approachable and more informal teachers. Teachers that care seem to be really good. Yeah there are the ones that don't. But I noticed in my other high school even teachers that cared acted pretty un-approachable and just showed their care by signing you up for math and physics contests (Olympiads) we call them.<p>What doesn't work well for US high-schools:<p>* Too many what I see pointless after-school activities, too much emphasis on sports. Are all these kids going to become professional athletes. So why are they spending all afternoons bumping into each other at high speeds and getting injured.<p>* Social scene is fucked up and detracts from learning. Because there are so many activities and so much individualized choice on what classes to take. People form cliques and end up being not very approachable. There isn't a group of people you get to know and spend your whole day and years with. There was just less drama and mental effort spent on who is friends with whom and who cheated on whom.<p>* Too much emphasis on passive media aids (video) for teaching. There was a lot of ""here watch this video kids"".<p>* Too much emphasis on group projects. On a certain meta level they are great because it teaches everyone how group function and don't function. How to take advantage of others and how others get to take advantage of you. There were very few times when groups are evenly matched and everyone puts a fair share of work and end up with a great result.<p>What doesn't work well for East European high-schools:<p>* Corruption to the core. Everyone cheats. Teachers take bribes. Principles take bigger bribes. Kids cheat from each other. Those that don't cheat get left behind because those that cheat make the exams and test look like a piece of cake, so those get harder and harder (""Oh so it looks like everyone in this 10th grade knows about derivatives so well. Let's bring on the double integrals then!"")",1343664626

Your four years at an employer doesn't necessarily show me any of these things, at least not without a ton of hard, specific questions from me -- indeed, I think that that's what Ben was trying to drive at in his interview at Steve.  In my experience, it also happens to be true that top software engineers have learned quite a bit from a computer science education (especially when coupled with several years of practice), and when I find bright people who have dropped out of school or studied other disciplines and ask them tough, direct technical questions, I often find that they have wild misconceptions about the way computers actually work.<p>Now, you might very well be the exception to that rule, but the cost of a mis-hire is so astronomically high to me that you can expect that if I ever interviewed you, I would expect you to greatly outperform a top new computer science graduate -- and I would interview accordingly.

4312976,comment,4312480,4312480,5,0,nirvana,,,"I'm tired of ""Stocks are gambling"" nonsense like this.  Some companies are valued on the fundamentals.  In fact the best investment in the world right now is AAPL, which trades generally between 12-14 times its trailing EPS.   This recent ""miss"" was a ""bad earnings quarter"" and even then it grew at %20 year over year. (The lowest in the past 4 quarters by far).... but if Apple was a company that only and always grew at %20 year over year, then ""on the fundamentals"" Apple should be trading at 20 times EPS.<p>This makes Apple a screaming deal.  There are other good stocks out there, and if <i>you</i> decide to trade on the fundamentals, you can make great returns.  Its not very difficult.<p>The thing is, part of the reasons it is so easy is that almost the whole world has convinced themselves that its impossible and instead doesn't invest or puts their money into index funds.",1343664244

The script tells you to install XCode 4.1 because it doesn't work with 4.2... but XCode is up to 4.4 now, and I know 4.3 works because that's what I have installed! It also advises you to install ""latest stable"" but has references to 1.9.2 in several places... it is, overall, a mess.",1343664240

Most of these bots are ad scrapers/landing page scrapers run by people gathering and stealing the ads/landing pages of their competition. Facebook has known about the problem for a while (years), and have gone so far as to ban some accounts that the scrapers were running out of, but lately it seems the scrapers have been given free reign.<p>This is not a case of Facebook using bots to deliberately drive up ad spending. It's merely scummy internet marketers at work, with Facebook failing to detect and prevent them. The phenomenon is mostly present in the US 18-30 male demographic (where all the dating ads are, and where creatives can make or break you).",1343664211

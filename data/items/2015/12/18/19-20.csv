I mean, one of his posts pulls out the old libertarian canard of &quot;every potentially harmful product will be effectively countered by competitors taking the equal and opposite opportunity to sell good honest consumer-friendly protection&quot; by speculating that a market solution to smells designed to induce customers to over-eat could be rival entrepreneurs selling a nose-attachment[1]! And as far as I can tell, he&#x27;s actually not trying to parody his own argument.\nIf that&#x27;s one of the <i>best</i> objections he can raise to an example in Akerlof and Shiller&#x27;s book it must be remarkably good by the standards of popular economics texts.<p>[1]Perhaps the only reason America doesn&#x27;t have a penchant for nose attachments and no obesity problem is because the market isn&#x27;t free enough!",1450468713

I think often acts of sexism are not intentional and are deeply engrained in us. Here is an example that happened to me last night. I walked into a small startup pitch event, approached a group of older men and said hi. They barely reacted to me. Not 30 seconds later a man of my age (who I happen to know) walks in and this group of men all turned and shook his hand. To be clear they did not previously know each other. I don&#x27;t for a second think that any of these men saw me and thought to themselves &quot;She&#x27;s a woman, I&#x27;m not going to bother saying hello or introducing myself&quot; I just think that on instinct they saw a man and decided to introduce themselves. This happens all the time to women. I can&#x27;t count the number of times men have skipped over shaking my hand. It&#x27;s a small thing, it&#x27;s more than likely not intentional, but it is a bit sexist. Sexism isn&#x27;t always a big evil act, it can be a lot of small things that add up to make it harder for women to succeed.",1450468663

10760581,comment,10759781,10760509,0,0,cmurf,,,"The argument in the book under discussion is that the natural balance of supply and demand is favoring the seller, who is exploiting the buyer in ways the buy isn&#x27;t aware of, and is complex and fast enough that a regulatory paradigm can&#x27;t mitigate.<p>A &quot;free market&quot; is an attempt to simulate a perfect market, which is a theoretical construct that doesn&#x27;t exist. One of the things it requires is perfect information among all parties in the buy and sell process. Courts and property rights are one way of trying to simulate that perfect market, and thereby create a free market. But this isn&#x27;t actually working well enough, is the book&#x27;s argument, there&#x27;s still an imbalance that favors exploiters, i.e. the free market isn&#x27;t providing enough information for buyers to make properly informed decisions rather than manipulated ones.",1450468602

10760568,comment,10729266,10730223,0,0,lomnakkus,,,"> It can allow you to edit code faster, make changes faster, refactor faster, because rather than editing at the &quot;text-level&quot; abstraction, you&#x27;re editing at the &quot;code-level&quot; abstraction.<p>I explicitly stated that I at least don&#x27;t <i>perceive</i> editing (keystroke) speed as a limiting factor, so I&#x27;m not sure what you&#x27;re trying to say. My perceptions may obviously be wrong, but I think this places the burden of proof on those claiming an improvement.<p>My point (or contention, if you will) is that the power gained through local refactoring like this (moving a bunch of parenthesized code around quickly) is absolutely negligable in the grand scheme of things.<p>> By itself it&#x27;s not that useful, but combine it with type awareness, semantic awareness, you have an expert system, not just a code editor.<p>That&#x27;s really the crux isn&#x27;t it? I can only say that I haven&#x27;t seen anything even close to <i>this</i> yet even from AST-only editors, and we&#x27;ve been promised it for <i>sooooo</i> many years.<p>As of now IntelliJ IDEA/Eclipse can do <i>far</i> more advanced refactorings at the press of a few buttons... and some of these refactorings are <i>actually</i> non-trivial -- as opposed to just doing a block-select and moving code.<p>Granted, I&#x27;m sure they have a <i>lot</i> of code to achieve that, but I&#x27;d wager that the actual <i>parsing</i> from text->AST is a <i>very</i> minor portion of the refactoring code. I&#x27;m pretty sure the most difficult bit of that refactoring code is the bit that guarantees that the refactor <i>preserves semantics</i>.<p>EDIT: What I&#x27;m saying is basically this: I think it&#x27;s naïve to think that the AST is the big problem when doing IDE/editor-supported refactoring.",1450468495

We get candidates (HFT) with a CS degree from MIT or something, with 15+ years of industry C++ experience as a senior software engineer, who can&#x27;t explain the difference between a list and a vector (or when to use each), or give even a ballpark estimate for search/insert/remove times for a basic BST. At the same time, there are candidates who are technically good at coding, but terrible problem solvers. We do use whiteboards for the interview, but more as a conversation starter for the algorithmic design, and don&#x27;t expect compile-able code. In fact, when I interviewed here a year ago, I didn&#x27;t touch the whiteboard, and we just talked about the design, tradeoffs, wrinkles/edge cases, etc.<p>It is usually a pretty organic process. If we get into it and question their coding ability, we might ask a few basic questions, like how do you declare an array or vector in C++. Do you use std::algorithm? Then possibly into C++14 territory. It depends on the position. On the other hand, if they breeze through some basic coding questions, it quickly turns into a discussion and feeling the candidate out in terms of fit.

A T5 at Google, Facebook, or Apple is likely earning much more than this as their stock from 4 years ago is vesting at a much higher price than it was granted at.<p>150k guaranteed comp, 25k bonus, 75k vesting equity is low for the companies w/ equity run-ups in the past several years, in my opinion.

Worse, you have to remember to break the language paradigm <i>everywhere</i> you need to.<p>In C++, you&#x27;d just wipe it with zeroes in the destructor, and use RAII to make sure it&#x27;s freed when you don&#x27;t need it any more.  In Java, you have to explicitly overwrite it on your way out of the block (maybe with a &quot;finally&quot; clause).  But in Haskell, you can&#x27;t overwrite it (yeah, you actually can, but still...)",1450468149

Also see what people in other countries share and their news. the problem that Letfeed is solving is the reaching of every opinion and voice, letfeed&#x27;s most important value is to break the walls between the people who are in the same country and let them connect fast. what you want to say, just say it and it will reach to a lot of people so no need for searching for people to follow because they will come to you when you open your country area in a random way or you can searching them ..<p>Site link : www.letfeed.com",1450467648

That means loading from its original place in the original format without any previous transformations. This is in contrast to the traditional approach of database systems that the data has to be loaded first into a database.<p>This paper describes a way how unprocessed unindexed data can be efficiently used to answer queries using a database system. The novelty of this approach is mostly that they build a index on the fly that can be reused later and examining the idea of directly using the raw files. For efficient loading of CSV files which is also mentioned in the NoDB paper, I think those details are better described in a later paper from TU München[1] that examines this aspect in more detail.<p>HDT for RDF or Parquet[2] and ORCFiles[3] in the Big Data space, are (binary) formats where the data is already processed and stored in a more efficient format than plain old text CSV files. Creating these files can already be compared to just loading the data into a database. The only difference that format used for data storage is open and can be used by many systems. So its a completely different setting.<p>Still its an interesting thought to make databases aware of the indexed information in those file formats besides CSV so that these can also be directly used without loading.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol6/p1702-muehlbauer.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol6/p1702-muehlbauer.pdf</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://github.com/Parquet/parquet-format"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/Parquet/parquet-format</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+ORC"" rel=""nofollow"">https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageMan...</a>",1450467380

10760451,comment,10759164,10760016,0,0,louthy,,,"This [1] might help &#x27;get it&#x27; with regards to monads.  Very easy to digest.<p>You mention LINQ and the List abstraction.  Yes IEnumerable<T> is a monad (LINQ isn&#x27;t in itself - it [the grammar] is the equivalent of &#x27;do&#x27; notation in Haskell).  Monads are simply &#x27;wrapper types&#x27; that follow a couple of rules:<p>1. You must be able to construct one from the un-wrapped value (return in Haskell, new List<T>(...) in C#)<p>2. It must implement the bind function.<p>If you understand &#x27;map&#x27; (or Select in LINQ) then bind is very similar, except instead of returning a mapped version of the wrapped value, it returns a mapped version of the wrapped value, <i>re-wrapped</i>.<p>So in C# parlance (because I assume from your comment you use this daily):<p><pre><code>    IEnumerable<R> Map<T, R>(this IEnumerable<T> self, Func<T, R> mapper)\n    {\n        foreach(var x in self)\n        {\n            yield return mapper(x);\n        }\n    }\n\n\n    IEnumerable<R> Bind<T, R>(this IEnumerable<T> self, Func<T, IEnumerable<R>> binder)\n    {\n        foreach(var x in self)\n        {\n            foreach(var y in binder(x))\n            {\n                yield return y;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre>\nYou may recognise that as SelectMany in LINQ. Select and SelectMany are special case function names in C# that allow the formation of LINQ expressions:<p><pre><code>    var res = from x in list\n              select x + 1;\n</code></pre>\nEquates to:<p><pre><code>    var res = list.Select( x => x + 1);\n</code></pre>\nAnd:<p><pre><code>    var res = from x in list1\n              from y in list2\n              select x + y;\n</code></pre>\nEquates to:<p><pre><code>    var res = list1.SelectMany(x => list2.Select(y => x + y));\n</code></pre>\nThe result is a &#x27;flattened&#x27; IEnumerable<T> - and that&#x27;s why this is also known as flat-map.<p>It&#x27;s been a while since I&#x27;ve done any Haskell, so forgive me if I get some of the syntax wrong here.  But the LINQ statement above translates very similarly:<p><pre><code>    do x <- list1\n       y <- list2\n       return x + y\n</code></pre>\n<i>(I know there&#x27;s a list comprehension syntax in Haskell, but I assume this is still right, Haskellers?)</i><p>The syntax is saying &#x27;get the value out of its wrapper (the list) for me, so I can use it as-is (the add operation), then put the result back in a new wrapper&#x27;.<p>So why do we do all of this?  It&#x27;s so you can write the functions once that behave on the wrapped types, whether they&#x27;re integers, strings or any type.  The monad concept allows you to create a &#x27;chain&#x27; of behaviour that from the outside is opaque, but internally it&#x27;s operating on the raw wrapped values, as-is; and that makes all of the existing functions available.  This is one of the key benefits.<p>A good analogy is to call them &#x27;programmable semi-colons&#x27;, because what makes each monad type what it is, is the behaviour of bind and return.  So a list monad (as seen above) knows how to iterate the collection - so you don&#x27;t have to write a for loop every time, an option monad knows when to not invoke the bind function if it&#x27;s in a None state - so you don&#x27;t have to test it yourself with an &#x27;if&#x27; every time, the state monad knows how to propagate state changes - so you don&#x27;t have to have extra context arguments on every function down the hierarchy, etc.<p>They remove boilerplate and capture common patterns.  That is the other key benefit.  At its core is an abstract idea, and I think that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s sometimes quite hard to grasp; but it&#x27;s just a design pattern.  Forget the category theory side of it, you don&#x27;t need to know any of that to use use them or write new ones.<p>If you&#x27;re more used to C# than Haskell, then you may want to check out my &#x27;C# functional language extensions&#x27; library [2] that has C# implementations of the following monads:<p>Option<p>Either<p>State<p>Reader<p>Writer<p>And a few others, but that should be enough to get started.  It may help you get your head around it in a language you&#x27;re more familiar with?<p>[1] <a href=""http://adit.io/posts/2013-04-17-functors,_applicatives,_and_monads_in_pictures.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://adit.io/posts/2013-04-17-functors,_applicatives,_and_...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://github.com/louthy/language-ext"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/louthy/language-ext</a>",1450467338

What if the way I experience blue and yellow is opposite from the way you do, so that if my mind was somehow &quot;swapped&quot; with yours the sky and the ocean would appear yellow and canaries and cheddar cheese would look blue? Is there any way to know?<p>Regardless of your answers to the above questions, the very fact that we can <i>ask</i> that question intelligibly demonstrates that we intuitively understand that I experience the world subjectively and so do you.

I don&#x27;t know what they offer datacenter staff, but in many areas, recruiters are pretty adamant about people moving.<p>From my experience, say, the North Carolina scene, you&#x27;re lucky if you are going to get $120-ish with ten years of experience.  There&#x27;s some give or take, but includes large companies and banks.  You can do a little better at something like a Cisco if you are willing to trade quality of work.  Most big companies as well as startups are paying new grads somewhere in the low-high 60s or maybe 50s depending on where. I don&#x27;t have hard data, but it&#x27;s no where near $130k.<p>Data from cost of living comparison sites that some companies use indicates that these companies hiring someone in the bay area may pay those people 20% more for cost of living at most.<p>Startups pay substantially less on average, with senior level personnel getting around $100k, maybe $120k if you&#x27;re excellent and the startup is well funded - but this is 10 years of experience kind of stuff. I have unfortunately had to turn down some great folks because they wanted north of that - and they were worth it.  I&#x27;ve also seen companies where their maximum pay tier tops out at 135 for what amounts to principle engineer level positions.  (I&#x27;d assume a fellow at IBM would do better, but they are uncommon and few have a chance of surviving the machine to get there).<p>Conversely, really senior level software development positions at basically-exit-ready startups in CA aren&#x27;t going to be much better than 40-50% better than the above.  Some of these can be obtained remotely - sometimes.<p>What the article states as common for Google and Facebook are absolutely not the norm, and I&#x27;m not really sure how achievable that is for most people even there.<p>It&#x27;s great if Google/Facebook can allow to pay people that, definitely.  I just wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s even remotely common and does not translate.<p>I&#x27;ve heard some ancedotal completely crazy numbers from hedge funds that most people would hate working for elsewhere, but nothing nearing the numbers in this article.<p>I don&#x27;t really have hard data on the New York software scene or Texas, but .. again, this isn&#x27;t normal.  HN may be more of a microcosm than expected if most people do feel this is normal.<p>To put it in perspective, this is still amazingly high compared to a lot of other positions and you&#x27;d still have it really good.",1450467192

It&#x27;s all a pretense. These are stooges of the Indian National Congress who spread misinformation among the Indian public. They used divide and rule policy to divide communities among religious lines and then used the minorities for votebanks. India tolerated them for almost 60 years. This is the first time India elected a party apart from Congress with such a huge majority. So the liberal crowd is not really &quot;large&quot;. They are few and on the payroll of Indian National Congress (because it was the INC which gave them the honors).<p>India during the rule of Indian National Congress was effectively put under a National Emergency under Prime Minister Indira Gandhi during the 70s (Read more about it here: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Emergency_(India)"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Emergency_(India)</a>). The entire Media was censored, the democratically elected Opposition leaders thrown behind bars (with some who were even sent to gallows but narrowly missed it, some even died) and a mass-sterilization campaign was carried about by them on the Indian public. Can you imagine the Government barging into your house and sterilizing you forcibly so you can never pro-create? None of these so called &quot;liberals&quot; returned their awards and honors during that time. Not even when the same Indian National Congress committed genocide of the Sikhs in 1984 riots (Read about it here: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1984_anti-Sikh_riots"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1984_anti-Sikh_riots</a>).

Where was this &quot;liberal&quot; crowd then?<p>However, only after 18 months of BJP coming to power, with Narendra Modi at the helm, they started this drama of &quot;Intolerant India&quot; all because the Bihar (Indian state) elections was underway. As soon as the election was over, they disappeared. Do you hear about any of these so called &quot;liberals&quot; giving away honors now? Nope. Why did this movement suddenly die out? Has India which was intolerant for these so called &quot;liberals&quot; for past 18 months suddenly become tolerant after the elections?<p>But things are changing now. We have a really strong Prime Minister who is focused on development and bettering India&#x27;s infrastructure. We have normally stayed away from participating in Wars and always took a neutral stand. However, for the first time, India has taken a stand against ISIS by declaring that it is willing to fight under the UN flag (Read here: <a href=""http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/India-ready-for-operation-against-ISIS-if-UN-adopts-resolution-Manohar-Parrikar/articleshow/50199721.cms"" rel=""nofollow"">http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/India-ready-for-ope...</a>).

I get the feeling they were pointing this out to argue that &quot;we&quot; (modern day Americans) don&#x27;t really need to feel responsible.  &quot;Everybody does it, so it must be okay.&quot;<p>I don&#x27;t know what the answer is to the question of what actions I (and &quot;we&quot;) should take because of my responsibility (and our shared responsibility).  I do know that the responsibility I feel is greater the more tightly I am tied to a society or community.  I don&#x27;t feel much responsibility at all for homo sapiens&#x27; eradication of Neanderthals (assuming that&#x27;s what happened).  The actions happened too long ago and the &quot;society&quot; is too loose (homo sapiens).   I do feel some responsibility for what my country&#x27;s recent forebears have done; I feel a tie as an American and 100 or 200 years in the past is just a handful of generations.<p>For me it seems the minimum is to identify myself as an &quot;environmentalist&quot;.  Many (most?) of the objections to proper care of the environment come from people who argue against it because doing so will lessen business profits by a little bit.  Even assuming it&#x27;s true that it will lessen profits, seems like we need to devote more of our resources to preserving the environment.  At a minimum, that should mean that businesses in our society should have to accept somewhat lesser profits (perhaps by being taxed) in exchange for better preservation of the environment.<p>Also, I have no problem with businesses that affect the environment negatively bearing much more of the cost to replace past harms.  In the past, and even now, we&#x27;ve allowed businesses to pollute our environment (air, water, land) without them paying for the damage they&#x27;ve caused.

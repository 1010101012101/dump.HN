216426,comment,216358,216358,0,0,LPTS,,,"What a crappy interviewer.  The first question reveals the interviewer doesn't know Hofstadter from a hole in the ground.<p>Such a shame a great mind like Hofstadter is subjected to these awful questions.  Here's an idea.  If you haven't read Hofstadter's GEB and I Am a Strange Loop, don't try to interview him about it.  Especially don't open with a question that reveals this in the first breath Hofstadter responds with.<p>I love Bill Moyers, don't get me wrong here, but this reminds me a little of Bill Moyers talking to Joseph Campbell.  Campbell was so much more evolved in his understanding then Moyers, that Moyers (who is excellent) seemed like a dog trying to understand a card trick.  The interviewer seems like that.<p>It's well worth reading anyway, because Hofstadter is so damn brilliant.",1213318275
216425,story,,,18,27,codeforfood,"How can a teenager get a programming job over the summer?",,"I am a high school senior who is very talented at programming (at least if I say so myself). In my junior year I was a USACO finalist, so I know my way around algorithms. I know how to program in Java, Python, C++. I have successfully wrote a website in Django in the past. I am now looking for a job for the summer. I have looked at Rent A Coder but it seems inefficient: most of the time is spent on hunting down a manageable project and discussing the problem with the bidder, who usually don't even understand the problem! Does anyone have any tips on how to find a job? I am not looking for high pay, but it should be interesting.",1213318194

216422,comment,216417,216417,0,0,gnaritas,,,"Of course it's a hoax, and anyone laying down any sort of estimate about when AI will pass the Turing test is full of it.  We don't even know what intelligence is yet, so it's impossible to truthfully estimate when we'll be able to duplicate it.<p>When we do finally figure out what intelligence is and the first batch of AI machines starts coming out, it won't be human like at all, that's too hard and pointless, it'll be cars that can drive and other non human like things that are actually helpful.  It'll take years after that before we get it to the level of faking human behavior.",1213317866
216421,comment,216082,216082,0,0,jon_dahl,,,"Some of the calculations here are fine, but it leaves out by far the most important cost of contracting: dead time. If you're a contractor and you work 2000 hours/year (50 weeks) for five straight years, you've got a sweet gig. Most consultants work 3 months on, 3 weeks off, 6 months on, 1 month off, etc. So don't forget to factor this in.<p>I recommend not relying too much on calculations: the market sets your price, not a calculation. If your peers charge $100/hour, it doesn't really matter if your spreadsheet tells you to charge $70 or $150.<p>Also, what's with the reference to price fixing at the end? Have people really gotten in trouble for announcing their consulting rate? That would seem extremely odd to me. Most contract designers or developers have a standard rate, and don't keep it a secret.",1213317597

Claims to have developed a humanoid robot with an IQ of 130, which, I would imagine by definition would pass the turing test. I thought the best estimates said we are at least a couple decades away from being able to pass the Turing Test? Just wondered if anyone knew what was behind this.

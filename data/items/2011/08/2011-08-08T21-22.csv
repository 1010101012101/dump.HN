2861758,comment,2860646,2861185,2,0,9oliYQjP,,,"I'm a bit nostalgic but I think IE3 was huge. I was still in high school but I remember staying up all night so that I could download it the moment it was available. Up until IE3 was released, Netscape Navigator was virtually unchallenged. It was only a few months, but Netscape Navigator's big new feature was Javascript. IE3 came out with JScript support only a few months later and nullified much of Netscape Navigator's advantage there. It matched Navigator's support for plugins and HTML frames, which was important because a lot of sites were taking advantage of HTML frames at the time.  If I remember correctly, it even loaded pages a lot faster than Netscape Navigator. Netmeeting and Windows Media Player also eventually came bundled with IE3 which provided a tiny glimpse of what a future web could offer, even if our paltry 14.4k and 28.8k modems couldn't deliver at the time.<p>Also, ActiveX gets a bad wrap but mostly because of the lack of forethought that went into security and the fact that ActiveX was Windows-only. The underlying goal being able to add functionality to the browser using a ""real"" programming language was just ahead of its time. For what it's worth, ActiveX was a response to Java applets which attempted a similar goal but ultimately failed because of a lack of performance (i.e., people hate Java applets because they're slow). I don't remember ActiveX suffering from the same performance issues.",1312840739

2861732,comment,2861256,2861622,3,0,jerf,,,"""Which can be fixed either by increasing revenue or decreasing spending.""<p>That's actually not quite true. A truer statement would be that for a <i>given constant level</i> of spending deficit, it can be closed by either increasing revenue or decreasing spending. But you can't assume a constant level of deficit, because time progresses and politicians adjust based on their income and outflows. (Not necessarily in a good way, but they are looking.)<p>Try to put yourself more in a physics frame of mind than a political one. It's the difference between statics and dynamics. Solving the budget problem with a static snapshot of a dynamic process isn't going to work. With the track record that our politicians have, just handing them more money isn't going to solve the problem if they're just going to spend even more of it. A static-forces model of the political appropriations process fails to predict reality, the model where politicians dynamically increase their spending even more than revenue does historically fares better.<p>(... yes, I know it is odd to approach politics from the point of view of building models to predict reality and seeing which ones successfully, no sarcasm at all, I see hardly anyone take this approach. But there are in fact enough hard facts out there to have some success with this approach, if you can learn to take your science-trained sensibilities and look at the political world. Political science need not be an oxymoron, though I suspect an actual study of political science wouldn't look much like what is currently called that.)",1312840127

2861727,comment,2854695,2860407,2,0,anonymoushn,,,"Thanks.  I enjoyed reading this and found it sufficiently detailed that I could understand it despite being previously unfamiliar with some of it.<p>I don't quite understand why this solution is preferable to a solution which simply evaluates S(P_j) for each j and returns the minimum in O(n^2) time.  I'm also not sure why I would prefer it to a solution that is faster.<p>One O(n lg n) solution requires that we convert the ""Minimum sum of distances at a house for houses on lattice points in 2-space under the square metric"" problem to an equivalent ""Minimum sum of distances at a house for houses on lattice points in 2-space under the taxicab metric"" problem, at which point we can consider the two dimensions independently.  With some trickery we can find the sum of distances to other houses for all houses in the 1-dimensional version of the problem in linear time plus the amount of time required to sort the houses.<p>To do this, we begin at the house with the lowest coordinate and calculate its sum of distances.  From the the sum of distances for one house, we can calculate the sum of distances for the next house in constant time: S(P_j) = S(P_j-1) + |P_j - P_j-1|(j) - |P_j - P_j-1|(n-j).  This is not the most compact form and is an abuse of the notation considering that it refers only to the 1-dimensional problem, but I think it conveys its meaning well: Once the houses are sorted, the sum of distances for a house other than the first is the sum of distances for the previous house plus the distance between them for each house with a lower coordinate than this house, minus the distance between them for each house with a higher coordinate than this house.  The phrasing of that is not quite right for houses that have the same coordinate, but that doesn't particularly matter since the distance between them will be 0.<p>After that we can calculate S(P_j) as the the sum of distances for P_j along one dimension and along the other.  Finally, since we've calculated the sum of distances for each house, we can just print the least of these.  We could also solve the problem in linear time if we were willing to use radix sort, but we probably wouldn't want to do that.",1312840017

The Democrats want a big government, which takes in a lot of taxes and provides a lot of services to everybody. The Republicans want a small government, which takes in minimalist taxes and provides minimalist services. (I'm not interested in debating the relative merits of these two ideologies today.) And this isn't just the parties' ideologues, either -- the same ideological split genuinely exists in the US public (contrast to many other countries where the ""big government"" types seem to have largely won the argument).<p>Either party could easily balance the budget on its own, given unlimited power. However, because of the way the US political system just <i>happens</i> to work, it's very hard to do anything without getting at least some of the other guys on board.<p>The Republicans have for many years had a ""starve the beast"" strategy, figuring that if you keep on cutting taxes then eventually the Democrats will have to agree to cut spending as well. In recent years the Democrats have invented the opposite ""gorge the beast"" strategy, in which you figure that if you keep on increasing spending then eventually you'll be able to pressure the Republicans into agreeing to tax increases. And the poor beast being starved at one and and gorged at the other starts to... wait, no, this analogy is breaking down.<p>What's the solution? There really isn't one. The ideological split in the American public is real and it isn't going away any time soon, and folks need to stop proposing ""solutions"" which basically just come down to ""all we need is for the other side to come over and agree with us and it'll all be rosy."" That's not gonna happen.<p>But perhaps the first step is to acknowledge that this ideological split is genuine, and real, and does <i>actually</i> reflect the ideological split within the US population. Perhaps we can compromise, but first we have to acknowledge precisely what it is we're compromising about.<p>edit: Wow, I can't believe this got modded down.

I must not be communicating my point well, so I apologize.<p><i>If you meet someone who is quick on the uptake, who learns quickly; and contrast them with someone a bit slow; what are you to call that quality of them if not intelligence?</i><p>I would call that ""quick uptake"" and ""a bit slow.""  That's it.  Einstein learned to talk at 5.  So he was stupid?  This is a poor way to define intelligence.<p>When Dr. Kay says IQ, he also means this ""innate cleverness.""  And my response is that if two people lift weights, one has to work at it more than the other, but both can lift the same weight, which one is stronger?  Neither.  They're equally strong.  Mental acuity is very much like physical strength: it is what you make it.  So,  I say, it makes no sense to define a predisposition to mental acuity, since that is impossible to define, is easily misunderstood and doesn't reflect the end reality.  I'm not switching terms on this: it's a useless, and potentially harmful, distinction.<p><i>And I still think that if you use the words as Kay meant them, you would not disagree with him.</i><p>I think that knowledge is a basis for intelligence but not as important as Dr. Kay asserts. For me, knowledge, in-and-of-itself is only the vertices upon which to build the graph of true understanding.  How that graph is built is fascinating and I think deserves more examination, which is why we can't leave it a single term called ""outlook,"" in my opinion.  But that's just my opinion; I'm not trying to win points or arguments.<p>Further, Dr. Kay's goal was not to give a lecture on intelligence, but to get the audience to think harder about what they value.  Which is incredibly important and is just one of the reasons he's a hero of mine.",1312838351

14363,comment,14253,14253,0,0,zaidf,,,"My humble advice...<p>1. Take this demo OFF now! People are going to develop a SUPER BAD bias of your product that will be hard to overcome even in the future should you improve the UI.<p>2. Hire or partner with a UI designer who knows usability and design!<p>3. I'll hypothesize that most people that visit your site will leave without any clear idea of what your product is.",1176939739

(Or get access) <p>(3)  How do I use it?<p>(3)  What can it do for me?<p>Here's what happens when I visit the site:<p>(1)  What is Juwo?  After scrolling up and down trying to make sense of the page, I gave up and just started reading from the top.  After the first two sections I still am not quite sure what it actually is.  I feel I have to try to piece it together from all the little clues in the text.<p>(2)  How do I get it?  As far as I can tell, there is nothing to get.  I can't find a download area or login box anywhere.  Halfway down the page I see some demos, but I can't tell if that's the actual software or what.<p>(3)  How do I use it?  This question is answered, although I had to scroll down to find it and I don't really understand the explanation because I don't know what Juwo is (1) and don't know how to get it (2).<p>(4)  What can it do for me?  This question isn't important for me, but it is for some people.  A lot of the page is devoted to talking about how the product can help me, however because (1) and (2) haven't been answered, I feel like I'm wasting my time.<p>\n",1176938664

The harsh reality is that the vast majority of people won't make it through the first paragraph.<p>I don't have all the answers ... but try making better use of headlines, images/diagrams, or a quick demo. Somebody should be able to visit your site and quickly know what it is and the basics of how it's used. Juwo sounds like a cool idea, but I don't get that as soon as I hit the homepage.<p>Some examples of homepages that I like that do a good job of conveying the idea/service in less than 20 seconds (I have no affiliation with any of these):\n<a href=""http://writewith.com/"">http://writewith.com/</a>\n<a href=""http://basecamphq.com/"">http://basecamphq.com/</a>\n",1176938390
14357,comment,14308,14308,0,0,danielha,,,"Well, no one would pick the former choice because it's essentially an actual customer base versus stray eyeballs.<p>But keep in mind that web apps and advertisements are different beasts when it comes to frequency versus reach. For a web app, site, or service - of course you're going to want frequency. When it comes to advertising, the prevailing choice isn't as distinct. I'd contend that reach would have a greater chance of finding potential customers. Frequency can be seen as a nagging effect on deaf ears and blind eyes (the uninterested).",1176938274

Sounds to me like a great way to get people to try out your product absolutely risk free and with 2 user accounts being less than 5% of their user base they really have nothing to lose.<p>Will we see more of this in the multi user arena?",1176938070

14351,comment,14253,14281,0,0,Goladus,,,"I wasn't at the startup school either, but in my experience people don't want to have to scroll down just to find things.  People will scroll down to follow something they've already started, such as a comment thread, an essay, or a list of topics.  They also will scroll down to read a list of blog entries, preferably in chronological order.  (Otherwise they'll prefer to follow links to particular articles)<p>But if there is a variety of different types of content on the page, there should at least be a table of contents to do the scrolling for you.",1176937798

I attend one of the top schools where you're weeded out of the system very quickly unless you devote a lot of time to studying.<p>At least in my school, it's either you're all in (spending 50+ hours a week in and out of class), you barely get by (spending only time in class and minimal time out), or you get kicked out very quickly (spending only the time you have in classes).<p>I find myself coming up with mediocre grades and only mediocre startup work, when trying to do both :\",1176937725

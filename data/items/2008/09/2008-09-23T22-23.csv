I'm saying that it's unfortunate timing for them that a lot of the people who dipped their toes in specifically because they didn't have to commit to Disqus may very well jump ship now.<p>Basically, they gave their users an option to leave if something better came along.  If ID integrates with WP.com and everybody ends up having an ID account, that would probably be the ""something better"" that would push people over to ID.",1222210383

Inevitably, some of Apple's apps have been written but aren't yet released to the public. If Apple is planning to release, say, an official accounting app for the phone, they not only have an incentive to stifle <i>your</i> accounting app for the phone, but they also have an incentive to avoid tipping off the market too early by <i>publicly</i> rejecting your accounting app for the phone.<p>Fortunately, I'm not a soulless lawyer, so I'm also free to point out that this argument isn't so much a <i>defense</i> as an <i>explanation</i>, to opine that this sucks, and to observe that Apple's control-freak nature has now officially gone overboard. Of course, Microsoft acted like this for years, and it didn't hurt them much, so I guess it's not surprising that a company would try it again...",1222209403

If this doesn't describe your workload you would probably have to change this to support concurrent execution of multiple versions for people who have a session established<p>Approach 2)<p>Using any mainstream hardware load balancer (or presumably a similarly featureful free/open software LB), configure it to point at N+1 machines in a cluster. Administratively remove machines from the new session pool one at a time (virtual machines can make this flexible and easy to roll back). Once the established sessions have expired or been forced out, upgrade the software and roll them back in.<p>One neat aspect of this approach is if you have an ""oh shit"" hockey stick scaling issue, you can watch it happen on one machine before deploying it to every machine in your cluster. Also good for A/B testing, as mentioned in recent articles here.",1222208586

Now they are being turned into weapons by US politicians .... again. This is a huge, massive trend in US politics: seizing control of power points in the financial system and squeezing them as part of proxy wars against people, countries or classes of businesses they don&#x27;t like (see Operation Choke Point).<p>As someone in Europe, I don&#x27;t see this as Russia becoming communist.

7705241,comment,7703960,7704616,1,0,Silhouette,,,"I sometimes wish more states would build state-controlled basic financial infrastructure and cut out the established financial services companies from the low end of the market -- whether that is the big card companies or the big banks or the big insurers or the big mortgage lenders. These financial services organisations make staggering amounts of money for providing services that almost everyone depends on to function in society, yet with very little real accountability and rarely serving the little guy well, and with a long track record of fighting against any state-led efforts to improve the situation on either count. I&#x27;m not generally a fan of over-centralising government and infrastructure, but in this case I suspect there are now strong arguments for providing basic state-run financial services that look much the arguments for having currency and the lender of last resort run by the state and not for private profit.<p>The use of card payment schemes as a mechanism for sanctions in this case demonstrates external political influence. Maybe in this specific case some would agree with that, given Russia&#x27;s recent track record. But just imagine the response if Russia could do the same to the US or the major economies of Western Europe. Or consider a more ethically dubious example, like the UK invoking terrorism legislation to freeze assets when Iceland was in financial difficulty not so long ago. More than the political influence, these measures demonstrate the rather arbitrary nature of the services these big companies provide, or don&#x27;t provide, particularly across borders. For any first world national economy in the 21st century to remain vulnerable to some big commercial interest getting upset and taking the ball home, whatever the underlying reason, seems unwise on the part of the corresponding government.",1399391842

I still don&#x27;t know how I feel about it. And yes, for some reason I feel like I have  some sort of ownership simply because I found it early. An interesting case study of the human psyche all around.<p>2) At the very least I think it&#x27;s a great example that while we very often find ourselves lost within the HN bubble, we need to remember that (hubris aside) what we do everyday, even if it&#x27;s just a side project we did for fun one evening, has the potential to change the world in an instant. Exciting and scary at the same time (and depressing when you realize you haven&#x27;t tapped into this potential yet).<p>3) It definitely pissed me off to hear of friends paying for the game when I could have just sent them the link to Gabriele&#x27;s github. (Note that I haven&#x27;t found any versions where you have to pay to download, I&#x27;m assuming these people made some kind of in-app purchase)<p>4) While definitely in the extreme minority, I now have a couple curious friends who upon inspecting the original github link found the repository, and now are very interested in learning to code. I think we underestimate the power of showing people the &quot;behind the curtain&quot; stuff so to speak.<p>5) My absolute favorite observation is the amount of people who &quot;hate math&quot; or &quot;just aren&#x27;t good at math&quot; who love this game.

Arguably, they’re going to continue to patch XP for non-paying extended support customers depending on the severity of the exploit and especially if it affects IE.  We probably won’t see anything patched outside of serious  IE vulnerabilities or maybe a conficker-type vulnerability that can be exploited remotely. Serious vulnerabilities like privilege escalation that crop occasionally will remain unpatched.<p>What does this extended support mean for web developers? IE8 on XP is alive and well apparently. This is a five year old browser with a poor feature set compared to modern browsers.  I remember watching my remaining IE6 traffic disappear almost completely in a 12 month span about three years ago only to be replaced with IE8.  Is IE8 the new IE6? Maybe, but whats for certain is that this kind of extended support is just going to make the problem worse.<p>Of course, the larger question is why aren’t we all using EMET, which thwarts this, and other, vulnerabilities without patching?  I tested it in my environment, and Sophos refused to let IE run when EMET was running.  Sophos support had no resolution. If third-party AV companies can’t work with first-party utilities, what hope is there of Joe User or Joe Corporate Admin rolling this stuff out and expecting it to work without major issues?<p>The protections EMET offers are pretty impressive.  I wonder why these protections aren’t enabled by default.  This would be a good differentiator for Windows9.  I could see a business friendly version of Windows with less focus on the Modern mobile-like UI and a return to the full features of the Start menu.  Now, imagine it with EMET on by default with an option for admins to disable it via a whitelist.  One can dream.",1399389776

As someone who has been on the &quot;Threes! was there first!!!!&quot; train since 2048 took shape, I think I agree with both parties. Threes! is a polished game that people can pay $2.99 for in the App Store and enjoy. 2048 is a free web game that&#x27;s insanely approachable (it&#x27;s free) and people &quot;get it&quot; immediately. They both provide immense value.<p>I see where the Threes! devs are coming from because, well, a lot of people called <i>their</i> game a 2048 clone, and I&#x27;m sure it sucks to see people playing a similar game instead of buying yours.<p>I also see where Gabriele comes from. The guy just wanted to make a game! He wasn&#x27;t trying to steal anything from anyone, he made a lot of people very happy and he has nothing to be ashamed of, or worried about.<p>To be honest, I think if you take the intersection of 2048 players and people who would pay $2.99 for Threes!, you&#x27;d end up with a pretty small group.<p>I think everybody won here.",1399389708

That way, it would be a simple reduction:<p><pre><code>    function get_path($data, $path) {\n      return array_reduce(\n        $path,\n        function($result, $index) {\n          return (is_array($result) && isset($result[$index]))? $result[$index] : NULL;\n        },\n        $data);\n    }\n</code></pre>\nUnfortunately PHP&#x27;s function namespace is separate from its value namespace. We can&#x27;t define &quot;get_path&quot; using a couple of combinators :(<p>Also, requiring &#x27;strings without slashes&#x27; is a pretty bad idea in PHP in particular, since it&#x27;s meant for Web programming.

Since it doesn&#x27;t really matter where you split, but rather that you consistently split at the same spot, I think it can work by splitting on &quot;You&#x27;ve got item!&quot; text or other things like that. For instance, the first split of the Ocarina of Time escape could be split as soon as it displays part of the map for the zora river. The bottle split could be hit when you hold the bottle over your head, it could match part of the blue text box displayed over your hand since this exact spot on the screen would look the same for all N64 versions of the game. One of the key features of the auto split program would have to be that the image matching program wouldn&#x27;t be so strict as to require pixel perfect matches, but also would be strict enough that it wouldn&#x27;t pick up any false positives.",1399389222

7704854,comment,7703658,7704061,2,0,KMag,,,"A common way of expressing what Afforess said is that simple passwords with effective rate limiting offer &quot;brittle&quot; security.  As long as everything works perfectly, it&#x27;s safe.  However, there are many failure modes that rapidly degrade to trivially having access to all accounts.  One would prefer to have defense in depth, such that failure of one part of the system would yield a system in which it&#x27;s easier, but not trivial, for an attacker to access accounts.<p>Using a modern Key Derivation Function (KDF) such a Scrypt along with allowing more complex passwords would in many cases prevent attackers from accessing those accounts that used more complex passwords (or force the attackers to change the passwords on the accounts, risking discovery when the owners next try to log in).  Enforcing minimum password complexity would dramatically increase the percentage of accounts that couldn&#x27;t be bruit forced if hashes were stolen.<p>Hopefully the answers to security questions aren&#x27;t kept in the same database as the password hashes, since they&#x27;re nearly password equivalent.  Even if the security question answers are hashed, 99.9% of the answers can be easily bruit forced.  I grew up on g1SUIt2FJr1IHI Street and my first grade teacher was Mrs. IvwiYZ4Oar9uZg.  Last year my dog was named AuiwVvMSPNTWbgy and this year I renamed him to dBuSHCTJDuSdAUu, but few people are so lucky.  Also, when calling up my bank for help, it sure sounds like the phone operator can read my secret question answers off of the screen.  In any case, an attacker takes some risk of discovery by resetting someone&#x27;s password and hopefully banks all watch for spikes in rate of password resets, but secret question answers are nearly password-equivalent and seem to almost always be stored in plain text.  The secret questions answers are the keys to the kingdom and the amount of code that has access to them needs to really be minimized and audited extremely well.",1399388448

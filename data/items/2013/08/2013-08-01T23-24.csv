In fact I can refute every one of them. The problem is that there hasn&#x27;t been a concerted effort to define a software patent. Hardware patents are easier to define. They are that thing you build according to a patent claim. Software is neither a material thing nor a concept. It actually runs in a computer and more or less controls it. It is an invention. But the boundaries of the claim are difficult to discern. Most of that is because software patents are a few decades old whereas hardware patents are more than a hundred years old. Hardware patents have run through their paces and &quot;debugged&quot; so to speak of glitches in the system. Hell, all software is new.

The sequester has had very little/no effect on our work, if anything our projects and budgets are expanding.<p>I also have met many people that work at or formerly worked at places like SAIC, Booz etc. that hated every minute of it and described it exactly as you did, so YMMV. Also, the line of work I and my company are in is slightly &quot;unique&quot;, so we may be somewhat insulated from the problems facing contracting at the moment. Regardless, it isn&#x27;t all horrible out there, and I would much sooner switch to another contracting position or move somewhere completely different than ever take a government position again.",1375400911

JavaEE has progressed immensely and while the cool kids aren&#x27;t using it, annotation-based development has led to the same sort of &quot;convention-over-configuration&quot; style programming and a lot of code generation from a fairly small amount of code.  You don&#x27;t have to generate 10 classes and interfaces for each EntityBean (EJB1 and EJB2) anymore.<p>- &quot;... tools like Ant&quot; - Managing dependencies in Java can be a real headache, so you want to specify a tool-chain that has dependency management.  Say something like &quot;Ant+Ivy&quot; or &quot;Maven&quot;.  For integration with Hudson/Jenkins, Maven is superior but either will work.<p>- &quot;OO Architecture&quot; needs to be melded with an MVC/MVP pattern for big projects.  These architectural patterns help immensely with testing and code management (plus watch for package tangle in Sonar).<p>- What&#x27;s the rest of your tool-chain?  You left a lot of holes and it&#x27;s not clear from your ad which technologies you use and which you <i>want</i> to use.  For comparison, here is my toolchain (I could give you more detail but not here):<p><pre><code>  - JavaEE
  - WildFly
  - PostgreSQL
  - CouchDB
  - Maven
  - Jenkins
  - Sonar
  - Nexus
  - Vagrant
  - Ansible
  - JUnit and plugins (XmlUnit, DBUnit, etc)
  - Selenium2 (on the grid server and managed by Jenkins)

Almost none of that would have been possible for me without at least a significant portion of the above skills. Chemistry comes in lowest, but it was still somewhat useful for the cancer stuff. And a tiny change in what jobs I had would have made the chemistry highly relevant (say, computational chemistry - tons of that going on around the beltway where I lived for a number of years). From here I can go most anywhere - finance quant jobs at 250K+, machine learning/big data, more computer vision, or what have you. You can .... write some more rails apps. If you are really good, sure, write the next rails, but I would say your options are far more limited than mine.<p>It&#x27;s up to you and what you want to do, and what kind of potential you want to have available to you. University is not for learning a trade (by and large, medical school nonwithstanding); it&#x27;s an opportunity to take in a lot of subjects at a depth you will never achieve on the job or part time (unless you have an ~170 IQ).<p>I&#x27;m sure people will post counterexamples to the above, and surely they exist; I argue simply that education == opportunity. If you have any kind of mind, 5 years of writing yet another rails app will start to bore you to tears. So, the question is, what will keep you from being bored? Inventing a new social app or such? Maybe school is less relevant. Taking on difficult intellectual challenges? It&#x27;s pretty darn hard (not impossible, just very hard) to make your way without a strong math/science foundation. Also of note is how many people change their careers. Burn out in writing sw is pretty high. What skills will you have if in 5-10 years you want to be management, that CFO job starts to seem very interesting, and so on?<p>In short, I found my education exceptionally useful. You won&#x27;t even be able to get an interview for many jobs, not because of snobbery (as is often claimed), but because there is no way you have the background to jump in and read original research in a new topic and deal with the math and algorithms in a sophisticated way.

Currently we have a few PhD&#x27;s, few ex-googler&#x27;s, some tech book authors, couple of ex-linkedin, ex-microsofties, and stanfords, and a bunch of startup vets like Trulia and dealer.com. Heck we even have the guy who wrote the Java testing framework TestNG ( <a href=""http://www.testng.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.testng.org</a> ) and the guy who wrote Mailinator ( <a href=""http://mailinator.blogspot.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mailinator.blogspot.com</a> ). And we&#x27;re only up to 7 people.  But we want an 8th and maybe a 9th.<p>Job Description:  
Someone we want to work with. Someone who will make us smarter and better and, in return, someone we can make smarter and better too. Someone who will help us make our company and its products great.<p>Our technology includes: 
Java. Thousands of threads (Mailinator guy keeps adding more, TestNG guy keeps removing them). Tons of data, tremendous data analysis, fuzzy logic, machine learning, natural language processing. We use Mongo and we&#x27;re having no problems with it - because we&#x27;re careful. We treat every  superfluous database access and every unnecessary network call like its a small insult to our users. And gosh darn it, we love our users.<p>Simply, we are building a product that fetches and analyzes massive amounts of data to improve our user&#x27;s lives (see the website for a more specific description, or better yet, email me)<p>Job Requirements: 
You know Java (or at least you&#x27;re willing to learn it) - but hands-down you know some computer language cold.  You know it well enough to hate parts of it but yet probably understand why they&#x27;re there.  You get why algorithms are important and know when to implement them and sometimes, when its better to just do it the easy way. You understand that startups experiment a lot - and consequently discover amazing things occasionally, but throw away code far more often.<p>The static credentials on your resume are great but honestly, its the dynamic stuff we&#x27;re more interested in.<p>You&#x27;ve done stuff. You&#x27;re proud of the stuff you&#x27;ve done. You can show us - heck, you can&#x27;t wait to show us. It might be an iphone app, or an open source project, or a thread-safe cache-invalidation scheme, or a javascript game, or maybe you launched a startup. Either which way - you built something - start to finish. You can deliver.<p>The interview:<p>We love solving problems  and every interview question we ask is based on something we&#x27;ve actually had to code.  So we sometimes get rather excited to find a smart person willing to solve a problem a new way with us on a whiteboard. You should think this way too - you don&#x27;t rate interviews as being easy or hard - you rate them as being boring or fun. And we definitely shoot for fun.  Right answers aren&#x27;t the point - finding a good attack vector on the problem is.<p>Our CTO&#x27;s take on getting your resume Silicon Valley ready:  <a href=""http://paultyma.blogspot.com/2012/05/how-to-get-your-resume-silicon-valley.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://paultyma.blogspot.com/2012/05/how-to-get-your-resume-...</a>",1375399881

The UNIX philosophy of having many small, text-based tools and chaining them together represents a common platform, but its also a least common denominator platform.<p>As long as we allow that glass ceiling to remain, the best our tools will ever do is push it incrementally higher, one tiny step at a time. If we want to make big leaps, were going to have to sacrifice some of that generality so we can use more powerful but specific tools. Unfortunately, that means that any new programming language wanting to take on the established standards needs not only a compiler/interpreter, but also the rest of the ecosystem: a comprehensive tool chain, ample library coverage, documentation and training resources, and so on. It is also, almost inevitably, going to need some standardised way of bridging the gap to todays established languages for interoperability and backward compatibility purposes.<p>This is why I think the view that programming languages should be designed optimally for humans is short-sighted, and I suspect most of the big success stories in the coming years will be languages that <i>were</i> designed with clean semantics and easy parsing in mind.

They include all the spectrum from the former left wing guerrillas, communists, european-style socialists, etc.<p>Partido Nacional / &quot;Blancos&quot; - Right wing - more akin to Republicans, but pretty centrist overall. Hit very hard by corruption when they formed government.<p>Partido Colorado - Right wing - akin to Republicans, include most extreme right wing types. Their government led to the military dictatorship.<p>Partido Independiente - tries to be moderate left wing.<p>There are an estimate 180.000 consumers of marijuana in my country, about 5% of the population.<p>Edit: one of the main criticisms was about self cultivated marijuana, which was finally contemplated in the bill.<p>President Mujica (a very colorful character) said this:<p>&quot;We are not going to say that weed is good. What happens is, consumers don&#x27;t give a damn about our advice, but we won&#x27;t leave them stranded because of that. And they like the adventure of buying from the drug dealer around here and there, because it is illegal. And while it&#x27;s clandestine, you can smell marijuana around in many places&quot;<p>&quot;Nosotros nos vamos a decir que la maruja es buena. Lo que pasa es que los que consumen no dan bola a los consejos y no por ello hay que dejarlos en banda. Y estn atrs de la aventura de comprarle al narcotraficante por aqu y por all porque es clandestino. Y  aunque es clandestino el olor se siente por muchas partes&quot;",1375399613

They don&#x27;t give a shit about how many hours you work, they care about how much necessary work you get done.<p>There&#x27;s a trade-off to make here obviously, sometimes it&#x27;s worth it. Some tasks can still be done if you are operating at 50% of your abilities, but if running a startup and parenting were that easy our world would be quite different.<p>I won&#x27;t speculate on the specific situation you talk about because I don&#x27;t know the details and you do. I&#x27;ll give you the benefit of the doubt.<p>That said, your post rubbed me the wrong way because it&#x27;s too much like the common geek macho bullshit that&#x27;s too common in this community. You can&#x27;t bully your brain into working better just with a self-help pep talk full of bland aphorisms and completely ignorant of modern knowledge about health and productivity. And you might want to avoid the comparisons to athletics - elite athletes talk about and track their rest obsessively. They don&#x27;t show up to a tryout injured and defensively complain when it&#x27;s pointed out.",1375399085

From my experience, this is not the case at all.  If you read any math textbook, generally the last problems in a section are the most difficult to understand and answer, unless you&#x27;ve mastered all the concepts in that section.  Pure Computer Science is harder than pure math in many ways; 1) because unless you master all the concepts in a section, you won&#x27;t get too far, and 2) computer science in general, but specifically this textbook is geared toward people who have already somewhat mastered mathematics, so all or most of the problems will be like the last problems of a section in a math textbook.<p>&quot;If it comes easy, then you&#x27;re not doing it right.&quot;",1375398697

I thought learning the ins and outs of how a computer worked was a big thrill. I always wanted to know how a bunch of transistors could turn into a complex processor. How networking worked. Most of my classes are still relevant to me today. Being able to understand data structure. The laws behind optimizing branching logic. Everything I took was either very helpful in becoming a well balanced programmer, or was so interesting that I didn&#x27;t care if it was relevant or not. It worries me that there&#x27;s a trend of people just wanting to know the basics of what they need to know to build apps, and not the fundamentals of computing.",1375398293

For example, if you get rid of reasonable royalty damages and force patent holders to prove actual damages, it&#x27;ll become very hard for trolls to go forward with a suit.<p>The alternative I favor is adding an element to infringement that requires some evidence of copying, reverse-engineering, or appropriation. Since the plaintiff has to plead the elements of a suit up front, this will shift the fact-intensive part of the litigation over to the plaintiff unless they can offer some evidence of bad conduct by the defendant.<p>This changes the nature of a patent completely, but I think not in a bad way. If your patent is really worthwhile, independent invention should be negligibly probable.",1375398191

After several weeks on the job, and having gone through rigorous training, Bob was starting to feel uneasy with the work requirements and amount of details he knew. Bob had a TopSecret clearance however, and couldn&#x27;t tell anyone - not even his wife. After a few more weeks, he decided to try his luck at another employer. Bob was damn good too, one of the best in his field - he was guaranteed a job anywhere for competitive pay.<p>Except word got out about Bob&#x27;s employer - and specifically the subsystems Bob was responsible for implementing. After the negative press, the NSA didn&#x27;t renew Bob&#x27;s company&#x27;s contract which forced said company to let Bob go. That&#x27;s okay, Bob thought, he had enough experience in the field, right? Everywhere Bob looked was disgusted at his previous job and the moral choices his superiors&#x27; superiors made.

We have an AKA field where the patient can be called what ever the want, characters and numbers allowed. This is not stuck into medical image dicom headers but appears on the information system which is used when talking to patients or browsing records. Dicom files area transmitted across hospital, out information system data isn&#x27;t but does transmit reports with a limited amount of patient data on them.

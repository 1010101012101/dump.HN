However, calling it a &quot;third-party extension&quot; is pedantic. It&#x27;s listed on the official mercurial web site, and using extensions is much more a part of every day usage of mercurial than using extensions in git, for example.",1394636336

7385943,comment,7385297,7385297,1,0,tatalegma,,,"Pretty good, thanks for sharing. I&#x27;m learning angular and this was really useful to me.<p>One comment I have is I don&#x27;t agree with some of the advice about integration testing. Integration testing shouldn&#x27;t mock anything (except maybe truly external 3rd party stuff like analytics). If your app is interacting with your own internal services, for example to do user authentication, you should interact with a real instance of that service, not a mocked one. This way you don&#x27;t run into the situation where the interaction between the angular code and the authentication service is broken, but your tests think everything is fine.<p>I used to unit test extensively, and I still do, but I now prefer integration tests as my primary form of testing. It&#x27;s more important to me to know that major features that span across modules/service layers are working. Most of the time the low level testing isn&#x27;t as necessary if I know that things are working at the higher level.<p>I think mocking in integration tests is a cop out. First, it&#x27;s by definition not an integration test (but I hate those conversations or blog posts where people haggle over the definitions of &quot;unit test&quot;, &quot;acceptance test&quot;, &quot;integration test&quot;, &quot;smoke test&quot;, etc). Second, you should take the time to set up an actual environment that mirrors production as closely as possible, and run integration tests in that environment. This means running integration tests against services deployed to real servers that hit real databases.",1394636314

The point is that you want developers A and B to work on code bases that are as close to each other as possible, so that any problem in the interaction between these developers&#x27; work is caught early. Your project doesn&#x27;t need to be completed in a day or two, you just need to accept that you have a dev branch which isn&#x27;t always in a shippable state (which I think is usually unproblematic).",1394636298

No security person working at Microsoft would tell you they were confident that outsiders weren&#x27;t holding severe, exploitable vulnerabilities back.<p>NSA, meanwhile, is as competent at sourcing vulnerabilities as any organization on the planet. They have internal research teams that generate them that are presumably competitive with any private research team, and they apparently purchase vulnerabilities like everyone else ---  not from Microsoft, but from research teams that sell vulnerabilities.<p>Microsoft gives pre-release information about vulnerabilities to lots of different organizations; for instance, the IDS and network security vendors get pre-release info to create signatures.

That &quot;SF&quot; isn&#x27;t necessarily more NIMBYistic than sub-regions of other cities that have had &quot;high&quot; (say, 15,000 residents/sq mi or more) density for an extended period of time.  If those other areas had experienced a similar historical accident of municipal lines (ie, only those parts of a Chicago that have exceeded 15,000+ residents per square mile since the 1950s were considered &quot;Chicago&quot;), the thesis is that SF and those sub regions wouldn&#x27;t show <i>on average</i> dramatically different levels of opposition to new development.<p>I guess another phrase this thesis is that SF&#x27;s apparant NIMBYism is a misleading artifact of what you describe as a &quot;historical accident of municipal lines.&quot;<p>This distortion, of course, can make SF look good as well as bad.  You can pump SF up by talking about the ratio of <desirableculturalfactor>:Resident compared to Houston, or Chicago, or LA, conveniently ignoring the fact that in Chicago, the residential suburbs are counted, whereas in SF, they aren&#x27;t.  My guess is that this ratio in LA or Chicago&#x27;s densest 48 square miles would look quite similar to SF.  Or, alternatively, you can make SF look bad by excluding the sort of developments that favor the burbs (such as percentage of households with children - when a family moves from SF to Redwood City, SF &quot;loses&quot; a family - in many areas, this would just be considered a move within the region).<p>Good or bad, my thesis is that these differences are largely an artifact of how the borders are drawn, rather than innate cultural differences between SF and other metropolitan areas.  I don&#x27;t doubt that these cultural difference exist (and they may in fact be driven by the fact that the electorate in SF isn&#x27;t diluted by the votes in the surrounding areas), but I think they may be greatly overstated.",1394635341

7385784,comment,7384818,7385266,9,0,aspensmonster,,,"Well, I&#x27;d love to be doing work on the hardware side of things. I&#x27;d love to even intern --despite the fact that I&#x27;m graduating-- at a company like Freescale or Intel or Qualcomm or Cisco or AMD. As long as I could continue to pay the bills --and feed the student loan monster-- I&#x27;d continue to live as a student. I&#x27;d consider it a fair trade-off while I was grinding for XP in a field that, for all intents and purposes, can&#x27;t really be done in your garage any more. Yes, we can all play with 7400 chips and build radios and probe away at some cheap electronic gizmo, but nobody is going to be fabricating 45nm, 6-layer, N-core, superscalar, pipelined, cached, billion-transistor count CPU semiconductors in their basement labs. And nothing but years of experience at the interface of design, verification, and fabrication will ever produce a skilled engineer in those fields that understands all of the delicate interdependencies of that technological pipeline. It should go without saying at this point that no, I don&#x27;t have any meaningful experience in the current state-of-the-art of semiconductor design, verification, or fabrication and I honestly don&#x27;t see how it&#x27;s reasonable to expect me to.<p>Of course, while I&#x27;ve never had a <i>professional</i> software engineering gig <i>either</i>, I <i>do</i> have previous experience with development and other paid jobs in supporting roles like systems administration. I sometimes think that it&#x27;s simply a consequence of the barrier to entry being so relatively low. Do you have a computer (or even access to one that you can install software on) and access to the net? Congratulations. You have everything you need to start learning about concepts and tools that are immediately applicable and relevant to the field. And they&#x27;re Free as in Freedom to boot! So long as you have the time, you have all you need to get to a point where your horns aren&#x27;t entirely green and the spaces behind your ears aren&#x27;t entirely soaked. With guidance from more senior devs, you&#x27;ll get to their level too in no time at all.<p>But it seems no matter what I do, it&#x27;s always the software guys that are interested in talking. They&#x27;re so interested, it seems, that I don&#x27;t even have to go to them. They&#x27;ll come to me. Which is honestly shocking, given that I still consider myself a very sophomoric developer. By contrast, even getting the hardware folks to <i>show up</i> seems impossible. There was a recent STEM job fair at my university (Texas State) that really ought to have been billed as the Computer Science job fair. Sure, Freescale and National Instruments were there, but there weren&#x27;t any members from their hardware or verification teams. It was all software and IT. Samsung was there, but I honestly don&#x27;t know why. I didn&#x27;t need a hard copy of the job description that was printed from the online job site. Apple was there, but they were only looking for at-home tech support. Intel wasn&#x27;t even there. AMD wasn&#x27;t even there. NVIDIA wasn&#x27;t even there. Cisco wasn&#x27;t even there. And those are all companies with established offices in the Austin area.<p>My heart may be in hardware, but I still love software. And guess who&#x27;s hiring. And guess who&#x27;s got student loans to pay off :D<p>tl;dr: Yes, I&#x27;d say the problem does exist. And perhaps the reason why web apps are so dominant and &quot;infrastructural elements&quot; so maligned is that the barriers to entry are so different in each field, and the corresponding willingness to train in each field seemingly reversed.",1394634516

Exactly the kind of trendy abuse of a word to signal self-entitled and undeserved superiority.  To get paged emergently doesn&#x27;t describe the process of getting paged for an urgent issue, since the action of paging is different from the issue (how was the page button pressed?).

Now you have the same problems the OP is discussing - your git pull will merge the upstream branch in, which you don&#x27;t want (if you are like the OP). The only solution to this is to fast forward to upstream and re-do the merge (hopefully faster this time, especially if you&#x27;re using rerere!), which is basically what the OP is suggesting.<p>Also, it seems to me that the OP&#x27;s point is more &quot;why using pull with the default options is considered harmful&quot;, and I think it&#x27;s worth noting that the &quot;correct&quot; workflow you&#x27;re advocating doesn&#x27;t seem to be the one &quot;advocated&quot; by those defaults. You&#x27;re saying &quot;you shouldn&#x27;t be merging upstream in, you should be merging your branch into upstream&quot;, but git pull&#x27;s default behavior is precisely &quot;merge upstream in&quot;.

Patients are already given bracelets with bar codes. But there are many reasons why they may not have used bracelets with their system: It may have felt too intrusive a way to greet patients. The backend system already maps patients to rooms and providers are used to thinking this way. Providers are also accustomed to confirming ID verbally with patient and always using the bracelet to be absolutely certain when dispensing meds or starting a procedure. Finally, in an emergent situation the bed can be surrounded by providers, and asking everyone to step back to scan a bracelet just to look something up in Glass would not be okay.<p>2. If this use of &quot;emergent&quot; makes you bristle, then stay away from hospitals because all healthcare providers and especially ED providers use the term this way.

For example, the first line of the Anglo-Saxon poem Beowulf is &quot;Hwaet! We Gardena in geardagum&quot;.  &quot;Hwaet&quot; is the word that became &quot;what&quot; in modern English, and was (given that when the poem was written people tended to spell relatively phonetically) presumably pronounced.  According to <a href=""http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&search=what&searchmode=none"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&searc...</a> it&#x27;s from a Proto-Germanic form *khwat.<p>I don&#x27;t know when or why the &quot;h&quot; and the &quot;w&quot; got swapped around, though.  Certainly, when people pronounce the &quot;h&quot; it it&#x27;s more like &quot;h-wot&quot; than &quot;w-hot&quot;.  Actually, perhaps even more like &quot;f-wot&quot;.<p>I guess the question is still open as to whether the people who pronounce the &quot;h&quot; today are continuing an unbroken tradition that goes back to the Anglo-Saxons (and the majority who don&#x27;t are using a simplified form), or whether the &quot;h&quot; dropped out of use sometime after the spelling was fixed, and modern speakers are re-introducing it.<p>I can say, though, that it&#x27;s generally regarded as &quot;better&quot; to pronounce the &quot;h&quot; by a lot of English people, and it&#x27;s also strongly pronounced in certain Scottish accents.  (Some friends from &quot;posh&quot; parts of Edinburgh definitely pronounce it, and also say something like &quot;Wed&#x27;n&#x27;sday&quot; pronouncing the &quot;d&quot;.)<p>(Aside: I&#x27;ve read that the &quot;what!&quot; at the start of the poem was a use of the word as something similar to &quot;ah!&quot; or &quot;lo!&quot; or some other relatively meaningless poetical interjection.  This gives a wonderful historical context to P.G. Wodehouse&#x27;s characters greeting each other with a &quot;what, what, what, old thing!&quot;.

It&#x27;s best to view the current Silicon Valley euphoria as a testbed for new technologies and labor processes and as an incubation chamber for the next generation working class. All the awesome stuff the writer wants will happen in the next decade or two, and most of the technologies and technologists involved will have their roots in the present frothy period.<p>It&#x27;s also best to think comparatively: sure, maybe some capital is being allocated stupidly [2]. But lets compare to the second half of the 20th century and its great technological achievements. Technological development was uniformly directed toward the goals of state-building and war-waging. Given a choice between better sexting apps and barbarism, it&#x27;s not even a real choice. One is clearly a significantly negative-sum game, and the other is neutral to mildly positive. We only ended up ahead after the 20th century through a combination of good luck and technology&#x27;s tendency to adapt across domains and be used in novel ways.<p>[1] A minority of the start ups that actually exist, but let&#x27;s grant it for the sake of argument.<p>[2] The article makes this entirely about the allocation of labor, even going so far as to imply it&#x27;s character defects that cause workers to go work on stupid things instead of meaningful things. But fuck that noise: capital is the driving force here. I&#x27;ve never met an engineer who would prefer working on sexting apps to working on deep, fundamental problems. But our present system rewards capital for pursuing short-term profits at the expense of long-term economic growth. If you want that to change, fix the system.

3013540,comment,3013196,3013398,11,0,dspillett,,,"Windows and MacOS use different techniques when approximating a font to the pixel grid of the screen.<p>The Mac obeys the font, applying smoothing via anti-aliasing along the way, with no extra consideration given to the pixel grid.<p>Windows tries to snap things to the pixel grid. For most ""medium"" sized text this produces a sharper lighter look. For small text or (in your case) typefaces with light strokes to start with, if tends to make things look too light and a bit blurry instead.<p>These two pages give (respectively) an example of where the difference is clear to see and a description of the different processes:

<a href=""http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/06/font-rendering-respecting-the-pixel-grid.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/06/font-rendering-resp...</a><p>At higher resolutions Apple's way would definitely be better (you get a result closer to what the font designer indented). For low resolutions (like the 96dots-per-logial-inch Windows usually assumes on screen) the Windows way often produces much clearer text if you are not using font-smoothing in either case. Once you add font-smoothing techniques into the mix (they use slightly different sup-pixel mapping methods) it all gets a bit arbitrary, varying from typeface to typeface (and by size, the sub-pixel differences mean some colours are more affected in certain typefaces, and opinions vary from person to person too) as to which way around looks better.<p>The answer? Aside from just putting up with it (and testing your output on both types of font-renderer if you need/want to use typefaces away from the ""standard"" set) and arguing about which is technically the better mix of methods, the only real solution is probably to wait for nice high resolution screens that will make it a moot point. Unfortunately they are likely to be a long time coming, scaling the sort of DPI an iPhone4 boasts to 20""+ screens is likely to be much more expensive than the market will bare ATM.<p><i>lt;dr:</i> MS and Apple render fonts differently. The difference is often not significant, but it is often enough that unless you use the de-facto ""standard"" set of typefaces you need to test on both systems to ensure your output isn't blurry or otherwise difficult to read on one or the other system.",1316440720

I for one am glad that we didn't have this kind of disaster back then -- Microsoft has always recognized and capitalized on its bread and butter: Windows and Office. These two are the workhorses, the crown jewels in the Microsoft empire, and almost everything else that Microsoft does is centered on strengthening the positions of these two cash cows. Splitting these into a separate entity would have been utterly ridiculous.<p>Again, Windows and Office are and always have been the lifeblood of Microsoft.

I recall reading in <i>Cryptonomicon</i> two pages of some strange event before realizing he was showing us a different view of the Hindenburg disaster. I can't think of any example in <i>Anathem</i> where it wasn't immediately clear to me what he was trying to show.<p>On the other hand, if Stephenson has a fault as a writer, it's the way he writes books' endings. The ends of <i>Snow Crash</i> or <i>Diamond Age</i> were just a mess. He skirted that in <i>Cryptonomicon</i> by just not really having an ending. I confess to not having been able to make it to the end of <i>The Baroque Cycle</i>, so I can't say. But then <i>Anathem</i> had a real, if rather out-of-left-field, ending.<p>So I think that while he may be trending toward greater accessibility, he's also trending to writing better endings.",1316440512

It simply is not a good of a book as the Baroque Cycle volumes or Cryptinomicon.  I actually did not like Anathem all that much, as it felt too contrived.<p>That said, Reamde is a fun read.  I suppose it could be put into the book category of Thriller as the article suggests.  I'd give it a 3/5 stars, as in, I liked it, but won't bother reading it again.  Which is how I feel about most decent thrillers.  But then again, it appears that it will have an actual climactic ending to the story/book, which Stephenson has failed to do many times as his other books just peter out without ending properly (Snow Crash, Cryptinomicon, etc).<p>It <i>is</i> more accessible.  It is a thriller, and could be easily sold as airport pulp.  There's a few descriptions of unix commands that various hackers are taking that would be skipped in a normal thriller, which does make it a Stephenson book.  But, I am glad that Stephenson is experimenting with writing styles.  Why would I want to read the same book over and over, just with different characters (which is all too common for writers)?",1316440387

3013528,comment,3013211,3013471,3,0,elliottcarlson,,,"The thing about Stephenson is that he takes a lot of time to do proper research in to his topics, and with his parents both being in academia (fathers side is electrical engineering with physics, and mothers side is biochemistry) he has excellent knowledge sources as well as learned how to do proper research (this is what he explained at a book signing for the Boroque Cycle's first book), and it shows in all his work.<p>The problem, as I see it with Stephenson, is that he goes in to such detail that he always needs to build up the world in such a depth that it can make the opening to his books long winded. Any time I have recommended a Stephenson book (and I've read them all, and recommend them all) I warn people to get past page 100, because that's when you will get sucked in to the story. His writing style can be a little unsettling until you get used to it (IMHO), but once you are in there you won't want to put the book down.<p>As for recommendations - Cryptonomicon, Snowcrash, Diamond Age are all great - the later two are far easier reading but still show the great depths of knowledge and research put in to the books.

3013481,comment,3011981,3012568,1,0,japhyr,,,"I agree that good planning software would offer the ability to tie into a curated bank of resources.  The ones I have seen are spotty, and understandably so.  Wikipedia works, in part, because there can only be one article about any given topic.  But in a bank of lessons, you'd have to allow multiple lessons about the same topic, if they approach the teaching in a different way.  Curating such a bank is an interesting problem, and I have not seen it done well yet.  I would argue it has to be free to be done well - any such bank that sits behind a paywall would not build enough lessons to be complete, and it would not reach enough people to make education better overall.<p>Tying in to a bank of resources is not a requirement, though.  You have to think in terms of unit planning, rather than just lesson planning.  A unit might consist of three investigations.  So on the first page or screen, a teacher gives a title, unit description, and one-sentence description of the three investigations.  In a word processor, the teacher has to copy those descriptions onto separate pages to describe each investigation in more detail.  Planning software would do that automatically for you, so changing the description of the investigation in one place would change it everywhere in the unit plans.<p>I am still trying to decide how I feel about the role of non-profit and for-profit organizations in education.  People should definitely be paid for their work.  So a team should be able to propose a solid solution to this issue, gather funding from public resources, and make the final product available to everyone while paying themselves a fair market rate.",1316439747

Hopefully the delays have no major effect on the device itself and the time that we've all spent waiting will be worthwhile. Guess we'll just have to wait and see.",1316438729

Spend a few years playing with some fun tech, don't have to worry too much about profits/long-term viability - just keep enough cash to operate, and exit with a nice chunk of change and move on to the next.<p>On the other hand, it's a VERY risky strategy -- it doesn't  necessarily build a fundamentally strong business (it certainly might though) and if the exit doesn't happen (or doesn't happen quickly enough), the company could very easily vanish with nothing left to show for itself.<p>I personally prefer the more fundamentally sound approach - build something great, viable, and long-term successful.  Maybe you exit with a huge acquisition.  Maybe you exit with an IPO.  Maybe you don't exit and reap profits for years to come.  But that doesn't mean that the flipping approach doesn't have the potential to reward or should be avoided (heck plenty of people are doing it and making a ton of money).<p>I'd say the key points to consider are these:<p>1.  Do _you_ believe this is something that one of the large corporate/whoevers will want to buy in a few years?  Or do you think that's an excuse for a lack of a viable business model?<p>2.  Do you like the project?  Regardless of exist, it'll be your home for a few years, so you should enjoy the work and make sure it will help your long-term aspirations beyond the next few years.<p>3.  Since the goal is a flip, that means that equity is key.  Will you have enough equity to reap the benefits?  If the flip doesn't happen, will you be paid enough to make the time spent worthwhile?<p>Just consider all angles and make sure your interests are looked-after.

10957261,comment,10950449,10950449,0,0,mortdeus,,,"Yep. My flytrap won&#x27;t trigger its petals until you poke it twice with a toothpick in the same general area. I think it does this for numerous reasons.<p>1. If the petals close and they don&#x27;t actually capture anything, they take hours to open back up.<p>2. If they do close on something, (for example a fly or a spider I happen to come across) they will stay closed for days digesting whatever is trapped inside. The traps themselves don&#x27;t actually survive this process. They wilt away and new petals grow to replace the old after a month or so.<p>Speaking strictly from a natural selection point of view it make sense that a plant that has evolved to derive it&#x27;s nutrients from carnivorism really has no chance at surviving  if something as simple as a leaf, a seed, the wind, or any other poor nutrient provider could trigger it to close on said object (or not on said object). Either way, a plant that is in such need of nutrients can&#x27;t really optimally survive if it closes at every opportunity it might have food in it&#x27;s trap to catch.<p>Natural selection seems to suggest that a venus flytrap that is more precarious about when to trigger it&#x27;s trap is the far more optimal survivalist when it comes to these plants.<p>I should also point out that calling them a flytrap is kinda lame considering their trap mechanism is not really all that fast enough to trap most flies. Atleast not in my observations. Although I have discovered that they get lucky from time to time, their trap mechanism is also apparently evolutionarily optimized to avoid most bugs that just land, chill for a minute, and fly away. Bugs they wouldn&#x27;t likely catch. They would rather wait for a caterpillar, spider, beetle, etc to cross their path.<p>My pitcher plant is the real fly catcher. It uses the old fashioned, &quot;oh hey thats a nice smelling hole. I wonder what  yummy things are down there for me and my maggot babies to eat. Dooo da doo da... eh... <i>feets sticks to pitcher plant&#x27;s trap</i> oh no... AHHH! HELP! SOMEBODY HALP MEEEE!... HELLO?! Isn&#x27;t there anybody out there!?<p>,,,<p>ohhhh pooo. Well at least it still smells wonderful down here.&quot; technique.",1453525099

No, I have a life, really.<p>We know quite a bit about electromagnetism.  There probably is lots of undiscovered fundamental physics. However, we wouldn&#x27;t necessarily need to discover new physics in order to do cool stuff like float something on the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field.  The breadth of phenomena which electromagnetism covers is huge, and many people spend a whole career working with just that one force.  It might just be that we haven&#x27;t thought of the right way to use it yet.<p>The difficulty with floating something on the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field is actually less about the strength of the field, than it is about its gradient. Because the Earth is so big, for the field to change by a few percent takes many miles of distance This is assuming we are talking about the average field as a whole, and not any anomalies which distort it, because if you are using a distortion of the field, whatever is distorting the field, like a magnet, is really what you will be pushing against.<p>Because force = energy divided by distance, and the strength of the earth&#x27;s magnetic field is essentially a energy density, if even a weak field changed over a small distance, an appreciable force could be generated on an object which interacted with that high gradient field.<p>But since the Earth&#x27;s field changes very slowly over distance, most of the ways of interacting with the field (like using an electromagnet such as in an electric motor) won&#x27;t give us very much force. Instead, we would have to use some other means which depended less upon the field gradient.  Some of these other effects would be e.g. the Hall effect, or an E x B drift.",1453523634

I&#x27;ve been saying this forever, based largely on personal experience living in countries where average portions aren&#x27;t grotesquely oversize, and where the chemistry of a typical meal is healthier and more natural.<p>I spent the first six years of my life in the USSR, where my formative attitudes about food were formed: received cultural wisdom was that you should be grateful for food and clean up your plate, both as a social grace and out of larger moral considerations. This stayed with me, but unfortunately is a disaster when applied in the US, where everything is enormous. Accordingly, I&#x27;m prone to overeat, since almost all eating out in the US is overeating by global standards. I&#x27;m not obese per se, but weight control has always been a struggle.<p>On the other hand, I lived in Yerevan, Armenia for nearly two years 2012-2014. Within about half a year of arriving, I lost nearly 30 lbs, eating an average diet and having no exercise regime whatsoever. There was no gym membership and no morning jog. I did nothing special to lose weight, it just happened. The amount of walking involved in everyday life surely helped, but it wasn&#x27;t extraordinary; the inner centre of Yerevan is small, not on the scale of a European capital. I just ate a lot less, it turns out. It was a fairly rich diet, too, with lots of dough, bread, meat and carbs--just less.<p>Of course, I promptly gained the weight back a few months after returning to the US.",1453523546

I didn&#x27;t mean to imply that LQG researchers had no interest in proving their framework to be compatible with Yang-Mills theory: that&#x27;s obviously an essential test of any realistic theory of gravity! My intent was to share my impression that they generally weren&#x27;t expecting Yang-Mills to appear &quot;automatically&quot; as a necessary component of the LQG formalism (much less for a specific group structure and matter content to be required by it). That&#x27;s in contrast to string theory, which <i>does</i> seem to fairly inevitably generate not just quantum gravity but also gauge theory by one mechanism or another. (And for a while, many or most string theorists were optimistic that a unique preferred background would turn up within a few years, too.)<p>I guess I&#x27;d say that string theorists I&#x27;ve known just don&#x27;t think about LQG folks much. I&#x27;ve seen skepticism and some level of hostility, too, when there was an LQG talk in the department. But even then it usually came with a baseline level of professional respect. (Maybe I wouldn&#x27;t say that so readily if I&#x27;d ever met Lubos Motl. There are always a <i>few</i> trolls, right?)<p>As you point out, quite a few LQG proponents talk about string theory rather a lot, and some even publish articles in which LQG proponent characters argue circles around straw man string theorist caricatures. (I read this one when it came out, as I recall. It made some good points, but it didn&#x27;t go out of its way to portray the string theorist character as a decent human being, and the tone overall was just so damned <i>smug</i>.)",1453523435

Guy (5 years experience) made a deployment job using a plugin without reading (or asking me) anything about it FOR THE PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT. Took hours to find out he thought the field does one thing but it&#x27;s purpose nowhere near. A couple of minutes reading upfront would have spared 3-4 hours of unnecessary work and frustration for him.<p>Example 3: Guy (10 years experience) wants to write an XML parser which deals with unicode. Randomly(!) putting encode() and decode() calls and cursing that accented characters doesn&#x27;t appear correctly. I explained to him how he should approached the problem and he succeeded at the and. I&#x27;m not sure he could have made the program work correctly or if he did, he was not able to know WHY.<p>Example 4: Guy (10 years experience) comes to me asking help about locale switching in Python. I never used that part of the standard library, so I just opened up the Python documentation and worked out the solution in 5-10 minutes (he sitting next to me). He did not even looked up the documentation for the function he was calling. I&#x27;m pretty sure he wasted more than 10 minutes trying to solve the problem...<p>I had an &quot;AHA&quot; moment when I realized if I read upfront much more (documentation, manual, any kind of help page) about the topic I&#x27;m about to use, I can finish much-much faster and understand the problem from the first moment much more deeply.<p>I started learning Python by reading the whole tutorial [0] upfront and learning Django by reading everything in the documentation, like I was learning for an exam.

The Standard Model in particular is based on a not-very-elegant collection of symmetries and particles: SU(3)xSU(2)xU(1), with a weird (but miraculously self-consistent) grab bag of matter particles that inexplicably shows up copied three times.<p>Extending the underlying quantum mechanical formalism of QFT to be consistent with general relativity would be <i>fantastic</i>, no matter how it&#x27;s done. But it&#x27;s entirely possible that you&#x27;d still be left with an equally broad framework, and that the Standard Model would look just as weird and arbitrary as it does today. My impression is that something like this is the goal of most loop quantum gravity researchers, and proudly so: they&#x27;re trying to solve one incredibly hard and incredibly important problem, so why borrow trouble by muddying the waters with more complications?<p>The ideal &quot;theory of everything&quot;, if such a thing turns out to exist for our universe, would not just be a framework, but would also tell you the unique set of specific details that describes our universe: something that looks like our familiar Standard Model under ordinary conditions. As I said, I don&#x27;t have the impression that most LQG researchers have ever considered that to be a likely outcome of their work: it&#x27;s just not the business that they&#x27;re in (perhaps by deliberate choice).<p>String theory has at various times in its history aspired to be precisely such a &quot;theory of everything.&quot; (I&#x27;m not sure what fraction of folks in the field today would still claim that as a realistic expectation.) Because so many details of string theory are dynamical variables rather than God-given constants of nature, there&#x27;s at least the possibility that there is a unique &quot;lowest energy state&quot; of all those variables that might turn out to be equivalent to the Standard Model. (Even almost philosophical questions like &quot;How many dimensions of space do we perceive?&quot; could in principle have a unique stable answer within string theory.)<p>Now, in practice, the way we generally analyze string theory today does <i>not</i> point us toward a unique answer, but rather something like 10^500 equally valid answers. Maybe there&#x27;s some deeper principle that will select a unique one of those as &quot;truth&quot; (which we&#x27;d then eagerly compare against the Standard Model as a test of the theory). I&#x27;ve done a bit of work looking at such possibilities, and mostly my conclusion is &quot;this is ridiculously complicated&quot;. Or maybe string theory is also merely a &quot;framework&quot; in the same sense that quantum field theory is. (But a very nice framework: one that <i>does</i> unify quantum mechanics and gravity in an elegant way, along with whatever approved collection of symmetries and matter you happen to stick in as its background.)",1453522205

I&#x27;m still not seeing where production is the problem. If production was the limiting factor, they would be running the factories 24/7 instead of shutting them down.<p>But if we can produce so many cars, why are cars still expensive? Shouldn&#x27;t the ability to create massive supply drive the price down a lot?<p>There are plenty of people that want new cars. And are willing to pay for them. It&#x27;s not like we have more cars than people actually want. It just costs a lot to make a car. And that cost includes fixed costs like the factory itself. But factories wouldn&#x27;t be closing down if other costs weren&#x27;t also very large.<p>Yes in theory we could make millions more cars than we do. But not for free. It would require buying more materials, hiring more workers, building new production lines, etc. Those costs must be greater than the expected return for selling another car. Otherwise they would already be doing it.",1453522064

The reason is that the second stage is going much, much faster than the first stage, so it&#x27;s a completely different problem to bring it back.<p>Blue Origins is not trying to get into orbit, and therefore is nowhere close to dealing with the issues that would confront a return of the Falcon 9 second stage.  Quite the opposite; from a speed perspective, the Blue Origins rocket is more like an easy version of the already-recoverable Falcon 9 first stage (although as Bezos notes, some of the balancing issues may be harder by virtue of having a smaller moment arm).",1453521869

Apologies for the long post, however hope it is helpful for someone in similar situation. I can relate to many things that he has faced and feel incredibly lucky to not have faced some things that he had to.<p>I grew up in a small town in a poor family in India as eldest of four siblings. Our monthly budget was 20 dollars and things were really tight. However my dad worked really hard 16 hours every day and made sure that my studies do not get hindered. He told me every single day that with hard work I can achieve anything that I can dream of.<p>I got into IIT Bombay (one of the most prestigious colleges in India). However it was obvious to me, that I need to get a decent paying job right after school to support siblings and my dad who couldn&#x27;t do 16 hours any more.<p>It took my the next 8 years working for others, to save enough to pay for the studies and marriage of me and my siblings and to help my dad retire.<p>During these 8 years, I built and ran the biggest social network to come of of India. Apart from this also built something which is now the Twilio of India. I was also the part of the team which built the current mobile offering at LinkedIn.<p>If I had financial stability, I would have started working on mine own ventures 3 years into my career. But it took 5 more years. As soon as I had financial stability, I quit LinkedIn (with 2.5 years of stock unvested) to start a company.<p>I started a company, where we had incredible opportunities. We built something like Slack for consumers around the same time as Slack. However, being on H1 visa, I was a minority stake holder in the company. And it is a bad situation to be in, if your traction is not already proven. It made sense to exit the company, so we sold it to Dropbox in an acqui-hire.<p>Dropbox treated me really well. I met some of the smartest people I have ever met over there and it can be a great place to work for many people. However, I soon realized that it wasn&#x27;t a good fit for me. Such companies are very top driven, there is little creative freedom, and most of the work is cleaning up the tangled code developed over 7-8 years. So I quit Dropbox after an year.<p>Now I am in a job that gives me more creative freedom and I am pretty happy on that front. Meanwhile, I have been sole advisor for a few companies over the past 2-3 years and they are all profitable and didn&#x27;t need to raise any money. The entrepreneur in me, keeps me raring to go and start another company. However, because I am on H1 visa, I do not want build another company with minority stake at formation (USCIS rules). To fix this, I would need to get a Green Card. However if you are from India, it will take you 8-10 years to get a Green Card in EB-2.<p>So the next steps are either move from US, or find a way to get a Green Card on EB-1.

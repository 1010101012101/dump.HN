601259,comment,600953,600953,0,0,JustAGeek,,,"""Growing a Business"" by Paul Hawken - hands down one of the best books on starting a business I have read.
Don't let yourself be scared away by the release date 1988, the advice in there is timeless.
Lots of the author's advice can still be found in other books on that topic.

The first person to call himself an anarchist was Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, whose most famous line is ""property is theft"". The first international was made up primarily of communists, led by Marx, and anarchists, led by Bakunin. Bakunin and the anarchists split from the international because they thought Marx's ideas would lead to totalitarianism. Bakunin's famous line is (paraphrasing):<p>""freedom without socialism is privilege and injustice, socialism without freedom is slavery and brutality""<p>Democratic may be the opposite of what you think of as anarchism, but what you think of as anarchism has no basis in history. You should probably choose a different word.<p>The anarchists who fought against Franco in the Spanish civil war, and who for a brief moment actually implemented anarchism in the real world, were explicitly anarcho-syndicalists.",1241895535

601256,comment,601041,601128,0,0,dgallagher,,,"Good question.  Note by ""entrepreneurial endeavors"" I meant start-ups, and not mom/pop ""home businesses.""  Companies which plan to scale to a reasonable size (20-1000+ employees), essentially.<p>I've come to that perception from economic classes I took in college, and from general observation of start-ups.  This is a good article which elaborates on entrepreneurial differences between the U.S. and Europe, citing economic, government, and social differences, among other things:<p><a href=""http://www.economist.com/specialreports/displaystory.cfm?story_id=13216037"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.economist.com/specialreports/displaystory.cfm?sto...</a><p>Noteworthy quote:  ""And far fewer start-ups in those countries become big businesses. Janez Potocnik, the EU commissioner for science and research, points out that only 5% of European companies created from scratch since 1980 have made it into the list of the 1,000 biggest EU companies by market capitalisation. The equivalent figure for America is 22%.""<p>It's not that doing a start-up in Europe means you're doomed.  There's just less of them which make it big.<p>Also, ""Europe"" encompasses a bunch of different nations with different attitudes and laws.  The U.K. is much different than Finland, or Denmark, etc...  So bunching them all together as I did isn't entirely fair.<p>If you look at one of the charts in the article, Denmark/Sweden/Finland all in-line with the U.S. when it comes to venture capital.  If you look at Europe as a whole at the bottom of the chart, averaging all nations together, you see a much different picture.",1241895382

Some of the questions he fields are kind of sad, and Chomsky is quite civil to the kids that basically want him to refute his own positions. If, on the other hand, you listen to his debate with Richard Perl, for example, you hear his opponent, clearly a public intellectual and a capable debater, take positions like: ""we were right to blockade, bomb and terrorize. It is and was in the national interest."" Does this help with perspective?

Look at a few examples from the music business: Microsoft discontinued support for their music download service. Walmart did the same thing to their DRM laden music. Now anyone that purchased music with DRM from those two is sol if their computer/OS goes down and they need to reinstall. since they cannot authenticate to the DRM servers the music stops.<p>Solution to the music: use providers that do not want to cripple you. (Amazon MP3 download is the way I have been getting all my music.)<p>Solution to the E-Book: You could probably strip out the drm from the kindle protected books. It is probably against the law in some countries though.",1241892144

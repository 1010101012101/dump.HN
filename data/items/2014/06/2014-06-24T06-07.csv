It turns out that the when the GFC hit the startup I was working for went under. So did a lot of places and I had trouble finding work. Now I have more family commitments I am a working peon for a small digital marketing company.... but there are days I wish I was back doing that kind of work again.<p>> If you are an Australian company you may want to be careful with this. A contractor is not necessarily a contractor in Australia, there are some strange guidelines as to when a contractor may actually become an employee.<p>Yeah this really only works if the contractor is working for a non-australian company. Then they are liable for their own super / tax / etc. Its a bit of a hassle, but a good tax accountant will get it sorted and reduce your liability at the same time. Contractor gets to write off their home (where they do the work), their tech, and more. Government hasn&#x27;t really cracked down on it, because its an export business and your helping the economy.<p>>I worked in Brisbane for 12 years and that sounds about right. Although the need for Linux admins seems to be increasing so there is some interesting salaries being offered.<p>Unfortunately not as much as I would like... seems between a lot of &quot;cloud first&quot; outsourcing and the fact that linux / unix roles tend to be in HQ (i.e. in Sydney or Melbourne for aussie companies) the linux roles tend to be limited.<p>On the other hand PHP/Web/.Net developers with linux knowledge is in demand. (Quite strange the .Net developer with linux server experience, but just check seek.com.au and you will find them).<p>Brisbane is and it appears always will be a MS town. 80% of systems roles are Windows/Cisco/VMware focused. Smaller guys tend to be more Linux / Mac OS based, but then you end up with hybrid roles where your also 15 other roles.",1403593081

7936499,comment,7935872,7936143,6,0,nmrm,,,"You make some good points, but many of your objections are shallow.<p>> It starts with colleges should be more than job training centers, then ends with trying to create an accreditation process to prove value to external entities (of which I assume employers are a big part?).<p>It is absolutely consistent to realize that a degree is not <i>about</i> job training, but should probably produce <i>employable</i> graduates. Ensuring the quality of the program is important for both. Many universities/colleges are &quot;not about job training&quot;, but all of them are accredited.<p>I think the point is to ensure quality rather than demonstrate value; the main reason he identifies for not attending the smaller public schools in his area is quality. Similarly for existing online schools, which definitely <i>are</i> about job training.<p>> It mentions the high cost of education, then describes how his current options are lacking because the number of classes in each major is limited.<p>I don&#x27;t think this is inconsistent (which seems to be what you&#x27;re implying), but agree that the author probably has a poor understanding of how such things work. See threads below.<p>> He talks about how administrators are unnecessary, then suggests a similarly labor intensive accreditation system that requires experts, committees and other logistics that requires significant manpower and time/energy.<p>Well, you actually answer this below. Lots of those &quot;administrative&quot; costs are <i>not</i> about necessary things like accreditation and instruction (sports, fancy facilities, libraries, etc.).<p>Some of these (e.g. libraries) are necessary (for serious students). However, this approach could externalize many such costs. Most public universities open these facilities -- esp. their libraries -- to the public (sometimes for a small fee). That doesn&#x27;t make the cost problem for the sector go away, but it does provide an affordable education for those who cannot afford the mainstream option.<p>> however his solution doesn&#x27;t seem to solve many of the challenges he mentions.<p>I don&#x27;t think this is intended as a complete solution. I think it&#x27;s intended to solve one specific problem standing in the way of a whole variety of solutions (that is, quality assurance and associated reputation).<p>> He finds it unconscionable that adjunct faculty don&#x27;t make enough money, then hopes to solve it with a free market - where honestly the things he values might not be the things many others value.<p>This is a fair and important criticism. I think the author of the post should think deeply. I imagine there are two answers. First, his approach seems to genuinely value rigor. This can go a long way toward resolving negative perceptions (one major road-block for these sorts of approaches). Second, there might be enough similar people that this sort of project could become feasible.<p>> He wants rigor - then critiques current accreditation processes that largely does what he suggests.<p>I didn&#x27;t see any critique of the current accreditation process. It&#x27;s fair to ask why he isn&#x27;t using one of those. I assume there are two reasons. First, many probably have a strong bias toward brick and mortar institutions. Second, I am sure many are &quot;rubber stamp&quot; committees (e.g. consider the dubious curricula of various &quot;accredited!&quot; online CS degree programs).<p>> Each of the major MOOCs already are trying to accredite/build reputation/be rigorous. What OP is essentially doing is describing the idea of Udacity, Coursera, etc without the technical backend, the users to attract such a marketplace, connections, support, or actually being able to do a MOOC.<p>Well, no. His model is actually very different.<p>The M in the MOOC model is important. Star lecturers, hundreds of students, several TAs and little or no cost to the student has been the model thus far. There are many reasons this model probably doesn&#x27;t scale to an entire degree program. Quality of assessment is one reason.<p>His model seems to call for something more intimate and more hands-on, with the instructor paid exclusively through student tuition. This seems both more sustainable and more likely to produce quality students (imho).<p><i>edit: cleaned up some grammar.

I agree with the OP&#x27;s sentiment regarding the real world value of some of the Products (and relating investments) out there, but this was not the driving force behind the Project I&#x27;m working on. I recently moved to the Valley because one of my family members was given a certain amount of time to live. This has been hard on the family, especially considering how many we&#x27;ve lost over the past 4-5 years. Spending a large amount of time in hospitals and observing how medical technology works from an Engineering perspective has led me to some realizations (or at least hypothesis). I believe that there are opportunities in the health and healthcare industries from a technology standpoint. And I&#x27;m not implying monetary opportunities, I&#x27;m talking about opportunities to build something that can actually save lives. My Project is focused on building the technical foundation for a next-generation Emergency Room. Even without a background in medicine, it is apparent to me (likely from my background) that a large amount of inefficiencies exist relating to the interoperability of today&#x27;s medical technology. The solution to this problem will represent a new approach towards utilizing medical technology, more specifically, medical data. The goal is to provide capabilities that greatly increase the awareness and effectiveness of medical staff operating  a modern day Emergency Room. I&#x27;m currently communicating with medical staff from a few different Hospitals here in CA in an attempt to build a stronger Team. I&#x27;m also looking for Developers.

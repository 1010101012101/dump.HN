It's basically the same exact model as Hollywood with different players.<p>In addition, if the only distribution model is online streaming at 0.99, you'd need to sell 10M views to just break even.  Yes, this can be achieved for a single hit, but for every single one to break even is similar to the current model.<p>One of the key things with the internet and technology is that:
 1)  Technology has enabled talented artists, filmmakers, and musicians to produce high quality content at a reasonable costs.  Take a look at all the quality production that is around on the internet.
 2)  The internet has enable low cost distribution and discovery service.  This means that we can increase the number of distribution channels for much lower cost than the existing model.<p>Because of these two facts, this enables smaller productions (you don't need $10M revenue if your cost is $30k) and more niche audience.  Think of all the long-tail movies that do not get made because the target audience is too small; these would become economically feasible with internet distribution.<p>The indie film industry follows this similar model.  A lot of indie films are low budget films made by students and budding stars.  These films and talent are then discovered by the big budget studios and brought into that fold.  (Think of the indie film community similar to the open source community in tech.)  They are often looked down upon by the big budget studios and the community is looking for that one opportunity to break big.  They have as much distaste for the Hollywood model as the tech industry does.  There is a huge opportunity in bringing them into the fold of the startup industry to counter Hollywood.  Provide them a clear path of success without giving up much of their rights or stake and they'll surely jump at the new approach.<p>Lastly, the internet is a great talent discovery.  Look at the number of mega stars that have been found on YouTube and other websites.  The problem is that once someone becomes ""Internet Famous"", how do you turn them into ""Real Life Famous"".  People like Justin Bieber have no choice but to fall into the hands of the existing production model.<p>Provide your consumers (in this case the movie production and the movie consumers) with a better product and all else will follow.<p>tl;dr -<p>1)  Embrace the Indie Film industry -- they are desperately looking for a partner in taking on big studios.  They have already been in this fight for years, that we have only recently just joined.<p>2)  Use technology to assist in discovery.",1327269441

3497831,comment,3497470,3497470,4,0,bcantrill,,,"I think that the ""death to Powerpoint"" point is too absolutist, because it may guide one towards talks that value entertainment over content. In particular, I tend to give highly technical presentations; it is essential that my slides themselves contain sufficient content to convey the core of my meaning. (It should also be said that I am an infamously fast talker -- having slides behind me can be a kind of solace to those who may be feeling as if under aerial bombardment.) The emphatic point to make, though, is this:  don't read your slides to your audience -- ever.  Instead, your spoken narrative should be just that:  a narrative that, over the course of a minute or two, winds its way through the bullet points on the slide.  Especially if your content is highly technical, this narrative is an opportunity for the less formal (and arguably, more engaging) story that surrounds your work.  Reveal your humanity:  don't be afraid to disclose pain, agony, excitement, euphoria or disappointment -- if the audience empathizes with you, they will naturally engage with your content. In short, use your narrative to put flesh and blood on the skeleton of your slide, and you will have a presentation that is compelling yet still rich in technical content.",1327269281

Any disruption to Hollywoods market space must center on finding a new distribution and marketing model that can attract the current content producers. Only by separating those two entities can you really disrupt the space.<p>Right now the people who distribute the content are also the ones who own the rights to it. That is why you have seen such a move towards limiting the rights given to consumers of the media. There was a time when a movie house bought the  reel of film and played it as much as their hearts desired. they actually made money off the tickets. That was then shifted to have the theaters pay a portion of each ticket sold to view the movie , removing the ownership right of the    theater. Now the theaters don't own the movies, make no money off tickets, and are dependent on the studios for all the marketing. If you as a theater owner tried to buck the trend they would just stop giving you the privilege of screening their films and your out of buisness.<p>There is a great symbiotic relationship between theaters and studios that just making new content won't disrupt. If you want to ""kill hollywood"" you need to focus on that problem first, once content delivery and distribution are separated you will open the market for a new generation of content companies.",1327269013

I've heard rumors that even part of the scripting is algorithmic these days (component based).""</i><p>There's nothing that sophisticated at work, I assure you. Hollywood has ""creative executives"" who read the scripts agents send them, and then evaluate those scripts by hand. Some are better at this job than others. Some are legitimately good at it. (Full disclosure: I held this job for 5 or so years of my career; I'd say that I was ok at it).<p>Scripting is done the old-fashioned way, as well, by humans using specialized word processing software (Final Draft for screenplays and teleplays, Scrivener for novels). This software helps writers sort through some of the elements they've been using, i.e., by saving character names and locations, and returning those names when called. And the programs have templates and auto-formatting. But nothing that actually does the writing for you. Not yet, at any rate. (Full disclosure: my brother is a screenwriter, and he's pretty good at it).<p>The challenge is that Hollywood does not have a halfway decent way of predicting or forecasting what will succeed and what won't. It <i>is</i> possible to judge good work from bad work, and to coach writers in improving their work. And there are ""rules"" of story structure, plotting, and so forth. But these are just structural. Very few people have any sort of gift for making calls about what will, or will not, succeed at the box office or on TV. Sometimes legitimately great material fails, and often legitimately atrocious garbage succeeds wildly. It tends to be a crapshoot.<p>I would suggest that, if we're interested in disrupting Hollywood, we stop focusing on a hypothetical, universal audience, and start focusing on niches. We have the technology <i>now</i> to deliver content to those most interested in seeing it. Netflix, Amazon, etc., do a very good job with collaborative filtering. The future of the content distribution business starts with interest-based segmentation, IMO. The sooner we move away from people's best guesses as to what will work for whom, the more readily we can adapt to the delivery methods already at our fingertips.",1327268924

Some other things that work for me (you'll have to take my experience as given);<p>- Make sure you know what you're talking about. Perhaps an obvious point but the confidence you have in the subject will carry you through more than anything. If it's your field of expertise, hopefully no problem but if you're in a position of giving a talk about something you're not an expert in, it's worth investing time and researching the topic well beforehand, preparing for questions you might be asked. At the same time, if you don't know the answer to a question, be honest ""I don't know but I'll get back to you when I do.""<p>- Talk to yourself beforehand. Run through the talk a couple of times in private, preferably standing not sitting but mumbling is good enough - no need for full volume. Helps to get a clear idea of what you're going to say and what the main points are. It also helps avoid those moments where you suddenly run out of words - your arguments are always on the tip of your tongue.<p>- Less is more. Few people can concentrate on listening to someone for more than 45 minutes and the more complex the topic, the harder it will be to follow.

It may occur either in retaliation or without provocation. In narrower definitions that are commonly used in psychology and other social and behavioral sciences, aggression involves an intention to cause harm, even if only as a means to an end. It has alternatively been defined as acts intended to increase relative social dominance.</i><p>Not exactly an endearing definition.  Dictionary.com has even less flattering definitions.<p>Passive (or passiveness) isn't the the antonym of aggression.

But I'm not sure if it'll make a big dent on Hollywood.<p>Why do some movies do well and others don't?  There are a lot of reasons.  But if we were to simplify, there are 2 things that matter more than the rest.<p>1. The buzz factor.<p>Reason why studios pay $20 million to a well known celebrity is because they know it will generate the buzz and create expectations.<p>2. The story and the experience.<p>Once the movie is released, and the first wave of viewers go and watch it, then it all depends on how good their experience was - for the buzz to sustain.<p>To beat Hollywood, you have to become better than them at telling good stories well, and creating buzz that lasts to make money out of it.<p>You absolutely have to become good at monetizing the buzz.  Only selling the movies for 99 cents is a bad monetization plan.  You will never be able to fund a movie like Avatar.  And if you can't do that, you'll never be able to take on Hollywood.<p>If I were to develop a plan to beat Hollywood, it would center around creating buzz.  How to use the new media to generate buzz.<p>Maybe create a new incentivized market... a whacky idea like: the first hundred thousand people who watch a movie can share in its profits.",1327268601

That would make making a profit incredibly difficult. It just isn't realistic.<p>Instead, I think a price closer to renting a movie on demand would work better with a bargain price for each view after that. Perhaps $2.99 or $3.99 for the first view and $.99 for each view after that. And then maybe when the viewer gets up to a certain view count, each view after that is free. This way, you can gain a profit with less viewers while also instilling loyalty in repeat viewers who are most likely to spread the word.",1327268591

Capitalism and the modern metropolis is the perfect environment for sociopaths to thrive, and research on sociopathy shows it is increasing in the West.<p>The simple fact of the matter is that when a sociopath is discovered, the discoverer will avoid the sociopath but WILL NOT WARN OTHERS due to fear of retaliation.<p>Fear keeps the sheep in check, and allows sociopaths to move from one sucker to the next. Each sociopath may only get to exploit a given mark (Mark1) two, three, or five times, but then that sociopath moves on to the next mark, and a new sociopath takes advantage of Mark1.<p>In this way sociopaths in our anonymous, private society run amok and their evolutionary strategy is highly successful. Sociopaths are found in large proportions among those who worked their way to wealth - ruthlessness and a willingness to exploit is highly lucrative in our private culture that has no accountability.<p>Dr. Martha Stout in <i>The Sociopath Next Door</i> gives the example of a sociopath who lied and blackmailed her way into a position as a clinical psychologist in a mental hospital despite having no qualifications.<p>Colleagues and patients became aware of the sociopath on multiple occasions, but when they would complain to the administration they hit a stonewall because the forward-looking sociopath had sexually blackmailed key individuals.<p>The sociopath worked as a psychologist for 14 years before a wealthy and connected patient was exploited and harmed by her, upon which time the wealthy patient's father threatened the hospital with a public lawsuit if they did not pay him.<p>The hospital administration paid a settlement to the wealthy client and fired the sociopath, but did not report the sociopath to ANYONE, including its own staff. The sociopath then simply went and worked at another hospital.<p>Over and over again in our society the pattern of the sociopath is that when they are discovered they simply move on to the next sucker.<p>This did not happen in traditional cultures. Dr. Martha Stout explains how in Inuit culture sociopaths would be ritualistically murdered by a group of men in the tribe. In 19th century America, if a sociopath scammed some people in a town, those people would capture and lynch the sociopath even if they did not engage in strictly illegal behaviour.<p>This selection pressure prevented the proliferation of sociopaths, but now our society rewards sociopaths and has no protective mechanisms. More often than not, sociopaths use their lack of conscience as a business advantage and rise quickly in organizations through charm, blackmail, politics, and ruthlessness.<p>We live in the age of the sociopath. Bad people are not punished but rather rewarded at every turn.

The mechanisms for such abuse should never even be created in a free country.<p>We might not have <i>Triumph of the Will</i>, but modern political machines are propagandists unrivalled in the history of humanity. For example, for several years in the early 2000s, as the most recent Iraq War was building momentum, about half of the US population thought the Hussein regime was responsible for the 9/11 attacks. That support was used to justify a war that has cost hundreds of thousands of lives and taken a staggering amount of time and money out of Western governments that could have been spent on far more constructive purposes.<p>> In fact a fundamental difference between America 2012 and Germany 1938 (among many) is that we have massive amounts of people vocally and publicly against the laws our politicians are pushing and the state of the country.<p>And the really scary thing in all of this is that you have massive amounts more who are openly complying and think it's all being done for their safety and well-being.

That's what's wrong with ""uhhs,"" you tend to say ""uhh"" more than you normally would in conversation.<p>I had a professor who was a fantastic presenter and would pause frequently and for about 5-10 seconds to allow what he just said to ""sink in.""  Then he'd smile and continue.  Don't be afraid to do that.  It's natural to pause and think about what you are going to say, even if you are giving a prepared speech.",1327266309

The nicer suburbs cost even more than living in the cities. Maybe you can find a cheap place in Fruitvale or Richmond. If those seem too scary check out what it would cost to live in Alameda and take the ferry. That said, I found everything in the east bay to be a major headache if you have to do any sort of dual duty between the valley and SF.

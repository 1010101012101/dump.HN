5213340,comment,5212313,5212313,15,0,cletus,,,"As an Australian (now an NYC resident), I am no stranger to the price gouging that Australians have had to suffer although I must say that how it is now is much, much better than it was 10-20 years ago.<p>First, it's worth noting that US prices don't include sales tax. Australian prices include a 10% GST.<p>Second, international companies will end up doing their accounting in one currency. For tech companies unsurprisingly this is US dollars. Transactions in foreign currencies get converted to USD. Companies hedge themselves against FX risk by locking in exchange rates and giving themselves a buffer so they don't need to change prices every day. Ergo, things in foreign currencies will always cost a little bit more.<p>So if a Macbook Air costs US$999 and A$1099 (hypothetical, the Apple store is down so I can't check what the actual price is) then that's about right (given A$1 = ~US$1.04).<p>That all being said, high prices in Australia largely come from it being a small market and, more importantly, consumers putting up with it.<p>Books are the worst example of this. UK companies get the distribution rights for Australia. Australian copyright law largely protects them from imports (although this was relaxed by the previous Howard government in a 1am Senate vote). Yet what costs $10 in the US will cost $25 in Australia.<p>The Dell E6x00 laptops routinely cost <$!000 in the US but cost ~$2.5k in Australia for no readily apparent reason (it's been a year or two since I looked at this so it may have changed).<p>The ""waterbed effect"" seems to play a part too. The US is a large single market so has a lot of purchasing power compared to pretty much any other market. I've thought that cameras are cheaper in the US (than Europe or Australia) for this reason more than anything else.<p>To give an Australian corollary to this: Dan Murphy, the largest alcohol retailer owned by one of the two supermarket conglomerates (Woolworths), is killing smaller competitors because their purchasing power is so large they can often sell things (at a profit) for less than non-chain stores can buy them wholesale.<p>For software in the era of digital distribution there's no justification for Adobe's prices here. It's the same software in the same language. Perhaps they needed different TOS/EULAs for Australia (or at least have them reviewed to make sure they are compliant with Australian law). That's about it.<p>One thing to be thankful for is the ACCC in Australia actually has teeth and through the Trade Practices Act and Corporations Act has a lot of power. The FTC in comparison seems to be a partisan paper tiger in comparison.",1360767564

5213327,comment,5212313,5213193,7,0,wtvanhest,,,"""Ripped off"" is really the wrong term for the pricing discrepancy created by having different places to buy the software within one market.  The better term is ""price discrimination"".<p>Business users of everything are less price sensitive so intelligent sellers of services, software, hardware etc. attempt to capitalize on them through price discrimination.<p>In this case, Adobe (or distributors) are aware that businesses would rather not have someone shopping around for software when they could be doing something else more productive so they would pay more.  The seller is able to capture the surplus.   This is a good article that at least early on focuses on inconvenience as the mechanism for price discrimination:  <a href=""https://www.rca.org/page.aspx?pid=2995"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.rca.org/page.aspx?pid=2995</a><p>Because of the comment before your's, I am not sure whether Adobe is using price discrimination against Australian customers but pharmaceutical companies do price discriminate based on geographic location.  (There is also a mention of this in the article above).<p>Effective price discrimination is a way to extract the correct price from various customers and ignores costs.<p>If a customer nets value by purchasing a product, the product is priced fairly to them.  Different users of the same product get different values, so every seller should try to figure out a way to get price as close to the value gained for each purchase for each customer.<p>The effect of price discrimination is higher profits for the seller, but it also spreads the cost of R&D more fairly based on value received by buyers.  Theoretically PD should drive increased innovation long term.",1360767436

Also, if you're worried about being paid, use the site's escrow system (Guru has one, I believe Freelancer does as well).  Your employer pays into the escrow, you complete the project, you request that they release the escrow to you, you get paid.  If they don't release the escrow, you can get (usually free) dispute resolution services through the site.  This has saved me from a shady employer at least once.<p>Your hourly rate very much depends upon your skills.  Start bidding high, and see if you get any catches.  There are people on these sites making $100 / hr., but these people have a lot of history and are well-known.  Don't expect to make the higher rates when you're just starting out, and remember you're often bidding against people in third-world countries.  At the same time, remember that you'll be taxed as self-employed, so make sure your rate includes the amount you're likely to pay in taxes in your country, and make sure you save that percentage back since you're likely going to owe big time when you file your income tax.<p>Getting projects is a challenge; mostly it's about projecting a professional appearance through your proposals.  Make sure your English and grammar are top notch.  Justify why you are the best person for the job.  Tell the employer what you'll do to build their project.  Split the project into milestones (each with payment attached).  Essentially you should be writing a highly customized cover letter in every proposal.",1360767399

These are first world cities where traffic signs were removed and streets designed along the shared space philosophy. The now dated analysis (I don't know of recent numbers) says that they are safer now than before this change.<p>There are a few reasons for why it can work. One is the idea that drivers on a well delimited road become complacent. If it's a road designed for cars, then drivers go faster, believe they have priority, and pay less attention to non-drivers.<p>You can't just get rid of signs and expect things to work, because signs are the only signifier. For example, the curb is a physical indicator of the boundary between the place for cars and the place for non-cars. Also, if there are more non-drivers often near the streets (cyclists, walkers, people sitting at a cafe table) then drivers will be more attuned to events which are currently rather low.<p>It also depends on a relatively slow speed. That video for Saigon shows that the traffic is about that of a jog. At that speed, it's easy for drivers to slow down, and easily within the normal reaction time for humans.<p>If you go this route then you can't have broad, open, clear avenues since that encourages drivers to go a lot faster, which makes things more dangerous.",1360766960

There's been some complaints about WebKit refusing to do the latter, which surely is a contributing factor to Opera's decision.<p>Without this common API, you'd have no chance in implementing the same features independently.

The first says ""There has been an extraordinary high number of boat accidents, people ending up in the water and general confusion since many are not used to the complex canal traffic code where imaginary lines mark lanes that you are not supposed to cross.""<p>Boats are definitely a problem. That WPI report I posted describes many of the problems with boats in Venice, including how they have ""the literal ability to destroy the city"" through wake damage, with pictures of what some of that that damage looks like and damage. Yet only 3% of boat traffic follow the posted speed limits.<p>(And I know that that report doesn't go into the full details. Wake damage also increases the amount of rotting in the buildings, because submerged wood and dry wood rot at a slower rate than wood which is both wet and exposed to air, which the wake in Venice exacerbates.)<p>My question to you was, how do you compare car traffic to boat traffic? Your response seems to be that you base it on the number of deaths or dangerous accidents. I thought surely that ""destroy the city"" quote would help you understand that you have an incomplete understanding of the issues.<p>BTW, if deaths and dangerous accidents were the key factors to ""clogged"" traffic, then NYC's traffic congestion could be solved with a 5mph speed limit.<p>You wrote ""Most of the boats you will ever see are the bus boats, or gondolas"". The traffic counts from that WPI report says that gondolas ""represent a tiny portion of overall boat traffic in Venice"" - except around the tourist area of La Piazza San Marco. It gives a breakdown. Gondole ""account for 4% of the traffic in Venice"" and ""turismo boats account for only 40% of the total traffic."" 44%+4% < 50%.<p>The majority of boat traffic, though just barely a majority, were service, merchant, and sport boats. (I checked. The vaporetti are classified as turismo boats for purposes of this analysis.)<p>So the reason that vaporetti and gondole are most of what you saw would be because you were a tourist, in the tourist areas, where the boat traffic more caters to you and people like you.<p>Doesn't all this suggest that you don't understand the traffic issues in Venice enough to be able to make a comparison with ""swarming"" car traffic?",1360765714

It turns out, for simple scalar (non-list) signal (reactive) values, the best thing to do was to simply recompute. However, for non-scalar signals (lists and sets), life gets much more complicated: it makes no sense to rebuild an entire UI table whenever one row is added or removed, and so we want change notifications that tell us what elements have been added and removed. However, I've changed my mind since: it is actually not bad to redo an entire table just to add or remove a row, as long as you can reuse the old row objects for persisting element. If my UI get's too big, I can create sub-components that memoize renderings unaffected by the change (basically partial aggregation).<p>Now how does that relate to theList.toMultiSet example? Well, the implementation of toMultiSet could be reduced to partially aggregated pieces very easily (many computations can actually), which could then be recombined in much the same way as rendering my UI! Yes, the solution that decrements/increments the count on a specific insertion/deletion is going to be ""better"", but a tree of partially aggregated memoizations works more often in general; its easier to do with minimal effort on behalf of the programmer.<p>I still need to understand their work better, but I approached my work from a direction opposite of algorithms (FRP signals, imperative constraints). I have a lot of catching up to do.<p>[1] <a href=""http://lampwww.epfl.ch/~mcdirmid/papers/mcdirmid06turing.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lampwww.epfl.ch/~mcdirmid/papers/mcdirmid06turing.pdf</a>",1360765454

So users share spreadsheets as they would any other Excel spreadsheet.<p>As far as the origin of spreadsheets that Bloomberg helps create, they usually fall into one of two categories:<p>- There is a gallery of great complex examples that have already been created and designed (probably initially for one client / company) that are available to launch from within the Bloomberg Terminal w/ screenshots, descriptions, etc. They can be searched and when a user finds one they like, it is downloaded and opened in Excel, allowing them to further customize it.<p>- The user contacts the Analytics desk (chat/phone) and is either trying to integrate live market data into an existing spreadsheet or needs to build something complicated from scratch and does not know how to go about doing it. The team specializing in Excel spreadsheet builds takes over and works with the person to build what they need.

Microsoft included a NIC in the XBOX at launch. It was baked-in; this was not an add-on. Sony had to step up and compete by offering the PlayStation Network Adapter, initially as an add-on. Also, Microsoft launched XBOX Live approximately 4 years ahead of PlayStation Network... <i>4 years!</i><p>Before that time, Sony essentially relied on game developers and publishers to support networked gameplay via a server infrastructure that was not controlled or offered as a subscription service by Sony. That service did not occur until Sony offered PlayStation Network.<p>2. Microsoft included a hard disk (a console industry first) in the XBOX, for storing downloadable content.<p>These are two examples of why it is not entirely correct to say that Microsoft achieved success solely by financial ability alone.<p>It was Microsoft that had the vision to launch with a unified, subscription-based gaming service with XBOX Live and a hard disk for storing additional content. They ultimately delivered a superlative networked gaming experience out of the gate, particularly with the quintessential launch title, <i>Halo: Combat Evolved.</i><p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_leader"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_leader</a>",1360764974

'The people getting into Ycombinator are Harvard/etc.. grads, why do I think I can compete'.  These are illusions to some degree, but definitely kept me from making a move up to this point.<p>Thanks for this advice, I'll definitely follow up.",1360764679

One day about 2 years ago, I saw an ad somewhere, that I could buy a bundle of both pieces of software for 800USD (I think it was). Seems fair, I thought and went to buy it online in Adobe's shop. But as a European, I was forced to the store of my country (Denmark) and the price was at least double. I tried buying from the us shop (since no physical delivery was needed), but was rejected for using a Danish credit card.<p>I still don't own Photoshop and Lightroom and Adobe is out 800 USD.",1360764677

This is a multi-billion a year industry that has stagnated and seen no innovation or development in 30 years.</i><p>Yesterday I had run into a discussion about blind programmers, and what technology they use.  Rather than using TTS I think I would (were I blind, I'm not) use a braille terminal instead.  Out of curiosity (or perhaps procrastination), I starting looking around at those, and they didn't seem much advanced, and very expensive.<p>I was thinking that instead of having the the braille ""display"" below the keyboard, I'd really rather have a small wireless version that I can pop in my mouth and read with my tongue.  That way I could still touch-type on a regular keyboard.  I think that would make me much more productive than constantly having to move my hands back and forth.  Maybe use Bluetooth with Serial Port Profile, and then it would be easy to connect it to phones and PCs.",1360764640

5213093,comment,5211625,5211830,11,0,michaelochurch,,,"<i>The only validation that matters for the success of your startup is validation from your customers. And the list of things customers want is endless. Reporters, investors, bloggers, commenters on HN are second order at best, and most of the time don't really matter. There's no fixed pie you're competing for in startups.</i><p>There's VC-istan and then there's the ideal of the customer-focused, lifestyle-business. I think you're conflating the two, which is not unreasonable because almost everyone does.<p>VC-istan is a system in which most people can't really play. You don't just decide to be a Founder and get sit-down pitches with Peter Thiel. You can't even get a real reason for a rejection (much less a decent chance at a timely acceptance) until you know people. It's an introduction-based guild system. That's probably inevitable and not the primary evil. The primary evil is that most of these VC-istan companies use ""be a real founder some day"" as a carrot they dangle in front of clueless 22-year-olds, who fail to realize that as subordinate engineers, they're getting absolutely no progress toward what they were promised.<p>VC-istan is a postmodern corporation, but it's effectively one company. The VCs talk to each other in all kinds of inappropriate ways, and they decide as a group whether you're hot (or not). If you're hot, you get the resources to hire 10 engineers. Or 25. If you're either lucky or a really good judge and hire good ones, you have a shot at something big.<p>""Founder"" is just a mid-level PM position in VC-istan. If you're playing the VC-istan career game, you end up caring more about investors and press than customers. Why? Because you're a selfish careerist (you have to be) and your investors will continue to have influence over your success or failure at your next venture. Your customers won't.<p>VC-istan, for businesses, is get-big-or-die. You're competing for scarce resources, whether they be ""eyeballs"" or investor attention, because if you aren't growing at 100% per year, you're ""walking dead"", which means yesterday's dogshit. The postmodern corporation of VC-istan treats companies themselves as disposable (which isn't right or wrong, just a different approach).<p>What you're describing, where customers are king, is a different world: slow-growing businesses that are often decried as ""lifestyle businesses"", but actually comprise the silent majority of new economic activity. These firms might define success as growth at 20% per year instead of 150%. These businesses don't turn into billion-dollar concerns quickly, and they're hard to sell, but if you don't mind being there for 10+ years, they're probably a better option. You're not going to have to sell your soul to remain ""in"" with the VCs and cool kids, and you can set up shop in a low-COL location like Madison or Portland.<p>The difficulty in starting lifestyle businesses is that you have to put personal savings on the line, and our generation (as a whole) neither has that nor is likely to get there-- ever. You put a lot more on the line when you start one of those than you do when you take a check from a VC.<p>Additionally, the danger, and it's what gives VCs power, is that your lifestyle business ends up having to compete with a VC-funded machine-gunner.",1360764609

This has nothing to do with open source, and everything to do with human nature.

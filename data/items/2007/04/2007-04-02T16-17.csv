The same guy who insists that you never need a multiple-column primary key.<p>I currently work for a company (yeah, yeah; the startup is gonna be next year, once I graduate) that produces software for health care agencies. We're writing the next version of our app in Rails, but the problem is that a significant number of our customers need to be able to use the app out in the boonies. Out where if they're lucky, they have _analog_ cell phone service.<p>There is a real need for offline capability for webapps; you just don't see it when you keep your eyes on 37Signals-type apps.",1175533169

He's written a code snippet or two of ""Lisp in Python"" -- unpythonic code that mimics the way Lisp does it, because he likes Lisp.<p>See: <a href=""http://www.prescod.net/python/IsPythonLisp.html"">http://www.prescod.net/python/IsPythonLisp.html</a>",1175532805

8245,comment,8123,8123,0,0,erdos2,,,"I mentioned the discovery of a hypergeometric combinatorial enumeration formula with a useful decomposition that could be used to find a limit probability distribution for the objects I was enumerating. I edited out the following: Richard Stanley had previously derived a rational generating function for enumerating the almost-injective functions, however, I could find no obvious way to manipulate this to obtain the limit probability distribution, nor did it suggest the decomposition of a non-machine summable formula into machine summable, asymptotically significant and non-machine-summable, asymptotically insignificant parts. The two-term formula was obtained by classifying the almost-injective functions using a regular grammar; the closed term arose from a sub-language closed under concatenation. Computer experiments suggest that a class of enumeration problems arising from regular monoids have closed form hypergeometric enumeration formulas. <p>Finding an algorithm for computing closed forms of indefinite binomial coefficient sums was an open problem in Knuth's Art of Programming; it was solved by Wilf and Zeilberger. In the example I considered, there is no closed form solution; however there is a way of finding a  decomposition of the sum with good properties. Finding the asymptotically significant term required an idea: the point is that the algorithms I used don't help you find this. One of those algorithms I used was due to R. W. Gosper, a legendary hacker.",1175532366
8244,comment,7754,8234,0,0,zaidf,,,"A HUGE chunk of motivation for a startup comes from working on YOUR thing knowing YOU own bulk of it. As soon as it is a corporation-powered thing you are an employee before anything and for me that is a huge turn-off. <p>What's wrong with the current model? If a company <i>really</i> likes smething after 3 months of YComb deveopment, it can grab that company for few mil and build on it however it wants.",1175532239

8233,comment,227,227,0,0,erdos2,,,"David Sternberg writes in his book, ""How to Complete and Survive a Doctoral Dissertation,"" that the right reason to pursue a doctorate is a deep interest in your discipline, along with the intention to work professionally in it upon completion. I recommend this book to anyone having first or second thoughts about pursuing a Ph.D.<p>
Social isolation helps if your intention is to get work done. In the words of the poet:<p>  ""Startups must be pursued for their own sake<p>   and never to impress potential mates.""<p>

6569839,comment,6569792,6569792,34,0,sillysaurus2,,,"Growing up, I declined to participate in the educational system (primarily to avoid harassment at school) and instead spent all of my time learning to program video games at home.  So I would sleep through class, go home, and try to write Pong.  My academic performance was nonexistent, but I came out of it with a career.  I was wondering, was anyone else&#x27;s childhood experience similar?<p>Highschool felt at best a dungeon, and at worst a torture chamber.  That was primarily due to my mindset. I didn&#x27;t really know how the world worked, and it seemed to me like the system had been designed for the purpose of dragging me down to the level of the brutes around me.  But unfortunately the experience killed my interest in wanting to strive to attend a good (or any) university, which I now deeply regret.  Not due to loss of credentials, but rather due to missing out on the social experience of uni.<p>If it were explained to me that the reason I was in school was because an industrialized society needs a place to put children for 8 hours each day so their parents can work, it would&#x27;ve made so much more sense than trying to believe the lie that we were there to learn.  It felt so obvious that we weren&#x27;t there to learn anything substantial.  By learning to program video games I&#x27;d gotten a taste of the amount of effort real learning took, and memorizing historical dates or doing trivial math problems definitely wasn&#x27;t any effort.  So maybe one solution to &quot;How do we cultivate the desire to learn?&quot; is to relax on the idea that school is even supposed to be a place for kids to learn.",1382072229

</code></pre>
It&#x27;s not exactly that there were people who knew they wouldn&#x27;t find any remaining WMD programs, and went ahead anyhow. It&#x27;s that strong incentives were set up to find evidence that there were WMDs in Iraq, so the evidence presented was weighted much more heavily towards that which found evidence of WMDs or attempts by Saddam to make or buy WMDs.<p>This was written shortly after the invasion, about how the Bush administration didn&#x27;t like the intelligence it was getting from the CIA, so it set up its own Office of Special Plans, specifically tasked to find evidence of WMDs in Iraq and ties to Al Qaeda:<p><a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2003/05/12/030512fa_fact"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2003/05/12/030512fa_fact</a><p>Well, when the entire purpose of your organization is to find evidence of a particular fact, you will probably find such evidence. That doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s true; just that enough dedicated people can find evidence for it. And since you can never conclusively provide evidence of the absence of a WMD program, especially since Saddam wasn&#x27;t always fully cooperative with inspectors, it was fairly easy to get carried away providing evidence that he had or was developing WMDs, without paying sufficient attention to any counter intelligence.<p>And of course there&#x27;s the Downing Street Memo, from July 2002 (nearly a year before the invasion) that reveals that the decision to invade was a fait accompli and the main point of the intelligence and inspections after that point that were just used to provide better political support for the invasion:<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downing_Street_memo"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downing_Street_memo</a><p>Also, not that the didn&#x27;t have to plant evidence of WMDs in Iraq after the invasion; people found out that there were no WMDs, found out about the Downing Street Memo, and yawned. The media didn&#x27;t care; the US media barely reported on the Downing Street Memo. The public and politicians didn&#x27;t care; after September 11th, there were still enough people who thought that &quot;something had to be done&quot;, and people who thought that Saddam had ties to Al Qaeda, that there was very little political push against the war.<p>That&#x27;s what gets me the most about this; how very apathetic the American public and American politicians have been about the mass slaughter of Iraqis (including thousands of civilians), torture, indefinite detention without trial in Guantanamo, extrajudicial assassination on US citizens, and so on and so forth. It&#x27;s chilling to think that so few people care.",1382071946

Yes, in many cases it can be easy to forget if the documentation is not woven in well enough.<p>> All public APIs should have documentation, even if you believe it&#x27;s obvious what they do.<p>As a note part of the function of such documentation is to establish standards for what is acceptable in terms of expected input and output handling.  What this means is that if documentation defines the code contract, then the first thing you look at when debugging is the API&#x27;s documentation.  Then, if it matches what you are doing, you might dig deeper.<p>What this gives you is not debugging by comments (something K&R rightly hated) but asking which side the violation of code contract is on.  If the documentation doesn&#x27;t match what you are doing with it, then the violation is on your side.  If it does, then the violation may be on the API&#x27;s side.  The goal here is to define where changes can most productively be made.<p>>  Because there&#x27;s other code in the wild that relies on the behavior that you promised.<p>That&#x27;s exactly right.  More specifically the API documentation is the promise.<p>> If you&#x27;re changing it so often that updating the damn comment is an issue you either document implementation details that don&#x27;t belong in API documentation or your API is unstable crap and nobody should be using it.<p>The thing is it took us a long time to get our documentation approach right in LedgerSMB.  It was a struggle that really only I think reached something I am happy with 5 years into the project.  A lot of our public SQL API&#x27;s are not documented actually, because they are dynamically discovered at run-time and are minimalistic (and consequently the developer contracts far more vague than the API conventions, so it isn&#x27;t always clear what belongs in the documentation since it is all dynamically looked up anyway), but our Perl code is very well documented and I am very happy with that.<p>For the SQL though, it&#x27;s written with documentation generation scripts in mind and therefore the question is what you can document on top of what is already there in the system catalogs.",1382070386

Hundreds of thousands of files on our shared drive were overwritten, about 2 TB worth of files.  Office documents, PDFs, and Adobe documents like PSD and INDD were encrypted.  JPEGs were altered but still viewable.  All files increased in size by a few hundred bytes.<p>Pull-only backups were the savior here, although because we didn&#x27;t notice until the next day, the pulled backups on that system were also overwritten with encrypted/corrupt files.  Luckily we had VSS versioning on the pull-only backup location. There was a close call in that the 2 TB or so of &quot;new&quot; data ended up pushing VSS over quota and we almost lost our good versions of the files that way.  If not for the VSS versions, we would&#x27;ve had to resort to cold backups which would&#x27;ve been a bit older.

The fact they were up until recently relatively undetectable adds another eerie dynamic to the situation. It highlights the aged old problem of people not pro-actively backing up their data offline until it&#x27;s too late. Go out and buy a couple of cheap 1tb external drives and back your data up now and keep doing it, there are even tools and drives that handle this automatically for you.<p>While ransomware isn&#x27;t anything new, the fact that the authors of such software are using currencies like Bitcoin make it that extra bit harder to track and stop these people from extorting data. I sense a new wave of ransomware is about to hit the scene now that Ars have revealed specifics about potentially making millions a year from such a racket. It&#x27;s hard informing people about these things without encouraging others to go and try writing their own ransomware and expect Bitcoin as payment.<p>This really worries me.",1382069092

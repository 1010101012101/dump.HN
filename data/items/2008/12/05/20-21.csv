I think it was 37Signals that referred to this as ""the tyranny of the client.""<p>I've always performed better when I had wide latitude, but this is difficult to pull off in ""the real world.""  In college and especially grad school, I could get out of all kinds of exams and assignments by suggesting a different project to a professor.  They'd get interested and say ""sure, do that instead.""<p>Thing is, it really didn't cost them anything.  Giving a student an ""A"" even though he didn't do the assigned homework is, of course, very different from cutting a programmer a check even though he didn't complete the assigned project.<p>In general, I'd figure employers are looking for the 10X productivity, whereas investors are looking for the creativity.<p>You have to live an edgier life to get to be creative.

And on it went.  In a couple of days to a week, we basically had the front end of the application prototyped.  Since it was back in the 'two tier' days all we had to do was hook it up to the database.

So when I said ""obvious solution"" I should perhaps have added ""within the parameters of the existing culture"".<p>I sympathize with your values, but the idea that you can change a corporate culture to make it recognize productivity in a more rational way is a fantasy.

No more concocting weird and wonderful tea's and juices to help get the Kratom down (and stay down!), all of this is a thing of the past.<p>In addition to the appealing aspect of no longer needing your recipe book alongside your Kratom Powder, Kratom pills have many other advantages; you can cast aside your trusty weighing scales and your handy measuring spoons. Kratom capsules are sold pre-dosed, which makes administering the product a whole lot more simplified and efficient. There is no unease of taking too much or too little, you can be sure that you are consuming just the right dose knowing the exact weight content of each individual capsule. Superb!",1310456708

Look, I'm not going to convince anyone of this point of view with a few hastily typed-out paragraphs on Hacker News. No-one can do that. It's something that rings true or false depending on your experience. My experience is that most uses of C++'s features beyond the rudimentary lead to software that takes forever to build, forever to run and forever to maintain, all of which are unacceptable and inexcucable. I started out in my pre-career as an enthusiastic C++ supporter who knew most of the tricks and dark corners of the language; template metaprogramming was (and still is) easy as pie for me. But every experience I've had since then has pushed me in the opposite direction, away from immature self-indulgent cleverness. Nowadays I mostly use C or a very C-like subset of C++.",1310456516

They know that investors make big money, while they earn less and less each year (after inflation).<p>The Western economic system (that developed in northern Europe from the 1500s on and then went to North America, Australia, etc with the English colonization) is build on mutual trusting relationships (a high degree of Social Capital, see eg books F.

2753850,comment,2752538,2753124,1,0,Sandman,,,"I can see your point, but think of it this way: No amount of security can protect against human stupidity. If I accidentally download and run an unknown application, and it asks for root privileges and I grant them, then if anything bad happens, I really can't blame the system. The system did exactly what it was supposed to do, it required the user to confirm the operation by entering the root username and password and if I did that then I explicitly granted this process to run as root. Same goes for surfing under an administrator account on Windows. Most malware these days is not successful because of their ingenious design (although there are such examples) but because they employed a successful social engineering tactic.\nI do agree that we should strive to create more secure systems, but I think that you can only go so far with that. In the end, users need to be educated not to grant root privileges to strange apps they just downloaded from the web or open weird-looking attachments they receive in their e-mail (even if the message seems to be coming from their friends).\nMy point is that people should have the same amount of healthy cautiosness when surfing the web or handling unknown data storage as they generally have in their day-to-day lives.",1310455052

I had access to draft technical documentation on it about .. oh .. early 2009.<p>I don't think it's breaking any NDA to discuss the overall aspects of the consortium's goals.<p>Basically what they are trying to do is produce a global network of secure digital content distribution servers. Under their model, all digital content retailers actually sell access to this single global commercial content delivery infrastructure.<p>However, it remains unclear to me under the proposed model:\n a) Who will pay for the servers\n b) Which devices will or will not be supported, and how media transcoding (to support differing device capabilities) will be handled\n c) Who the user complains to if they can't get access to the content they paid for\n d) What value retailers would add in such a scenario - indeed, how they would 'compete' with each other given very little control and thus capability for unique product offering<p>Like many dreamy consortia, I see this one as dead in the water. The technical problems are significant, and there is a general lack of impetus to actually get out there are solve the problems.<p>A DRM industry for plain media (consume only, non-interactive) that dreams of securing global distribution is, in my view, destined to self-flagellate until it is but a poor faded memory in the distant mists of time.<p>On the other hand, DRM <i>can</i> enable good consumer experience: I really like Steam, for example. I recently bought my first Mac and many of the games I'd purchased on PC instantly became available in my library. After just logging in, I could download them for the new platform and play away instantly... even though I'd changed countries and gaming platforms. This is what DRM <i>should</i> be doing: empowering people to mobility and choice through connected media. Steam just does so many things right: content discovery, supporting smaller and independent content developers, social elements.<p>I think the entire DRM industry should look up to Steam for a successful example of the future.

It would be much better if apps could just run HTML and Javascript instead, and still be integrated like native apps are now.<p>- Every web app that is deployed now is not guaranteed to work X days into the future. In fact, it often breaks. We need better guarantees for this.<p>- Browsers are incompatible in subtle and not-so-subtle ways.<p>- It is way too complicated to write a web-browser. The number of abstraction-levels combined is too large. Security problems are therefore unavoidable.<p>- On the front-end, React is a suboptimal solution because it requires O(N) time and energy for simple O(1) updates. We need smarter incremental computation techniques.<p>- The primitives for the web (HTML+Javascript) have been created for novices, instead of for developers.

And they got very rich data with it (although the difference in body fat didn&#x27;t reach significance, others such as waist circumference did).<p>But imagine that they were doing a different study. Something like a cohort, longitudinal and distributed: studying various corporations which use standing desks during a long, long time (a decade?). This would imply many different people collecting data in different context and different times (and, effectively, bothering even more people). Building labs or ensuring similar equipment across the different sites would be very expensive and laborious - not to mention error-prone! Just imagine the overhead of getting body composition indicators - even something simple as asking people to measure their waist, but during a decade across N sites.<p>In this kind of large study, a seemingly simplistic but nonetheless standardized (and, in a way, normalized) indicator such as BMI is an extremely helpful tool. Imagine you want to do an analysis not by weight, but by by &quot;obesity&quot; ranges, or check if &quot;obesity&quot; status changed: getting body composition is nearly impossible, but using the BMI pre-established ranges (lean, normal, overweight, obese) will actually be feasible (you just need height and weight!). And yes, although a bodybuilder will be considered overweight or obese by BMI, remember this is a study with a large enough <i>n</i> - edge cases will eventually average each other and BMI will hold true for the sample.

Office&#x27;s server portion and Sharepoint is all .Net so expect them to move it to ASP.Net 5 at some point.",1442570708

You might know him more appropriately as The Wolf of Wall Street, and its doesn&#x27;t matter what your opinion of the guy is - he has a natural talent for sales.<p>As you will note from his material, that there are 3 types of people, those that don&#x27;t want the product, those that are unsure if they want it, and those that want the product. Sales is about converting those &quot;unsures&#x27;&quot; to sure wants.<p>I would recommend giving the book &quot;The Wolf of Wall Street&quot; a read.\nHis course &quot;Straight Line System&quot; is pretty pricey, but if you have the money or the means, I would recommend this course over any other:\n<a href=""http://jordanbelfort.com/sales-order/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jordanbelfort.com/sales-order/</a>",1442570577

I expect it, it doesn&#x27;t put me off buying.<p>So it&#x27;s a bad objection to the system, because once everyone&#x27;s using it, it becomes the norm. Yes, there will be a dip in conversions to begin with as consumers are scared by the new page, but it will recover. Some people&#x27;s implementation sucks, but that&#x27;s a different matter.",1442570518

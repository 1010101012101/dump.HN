8783858,comment,8781768,8781768,0,0,tuke,,,"What was it like? It was horrible. My experience was very lucky, but it was horrendous to see all of one&#x27;s friends losing their jobs and scrambling. People who did get new jobs frequently took shitty jobs that set their careers back a few years. If you did manage to get something new in 2001 you were frequently locked in for some years.<p>I have been continuously employed or have had substantial contracting since 1999 (almost all regular employment, except for no more than a total of 12 months of various freelance).<p>I can only guess why, but it is probably some combination of:<p>1. When the layoffs came, I was in the non-laid-off remnant, probably because I always situated myself to know how everything worked, soup-to-nuts: code, databases, servers, etc.<p>2. Constant re-education, and willingness to use languages and tools I considered to have technical deficits (e.g., ColdFusion).<p>3. Constant teaching. Was always teaching Java or, later, Ruby in the evenings. Stayed sharp.<p>4. Constant networking. Very important -> I networked both at the tech level and at the business level. Keeping in touch with VPs of marketing and business development meant that when their cohort was looking for devs, the business-side VPs would think of me. Techie-to-techie referrals were nil.<p>5. Maturity. Was recruited into an executive position in 2002 perhaps because of attitude + tech skills.",1419267582

How could you not see the potential for VR? It <i>seems</i> so obvious, I have difficulty explaining it. It&#x27;s like trying to explain vision to the blind. What sort of culture differences there must be to make communicating this idea so difficult.<p>At the same time, a lot of VR enthusiasts bug the hell out of me, too. They have their pet project and they think that&#x27;s the <i>only</i> thing worth doing in VR. It&#x27;s going on in this very thread right now: strong opinions on what is and is not VR and any dissent otherwise is foolhardy.<p>People who talk about &quot;oh, augmented reality is the only way the hardware is going to make it, VR isn&#x27;t enough.&quot; Or the folks who insist that &quot;only a PC-based platform will work, thus it is doomed, because the PC is doomed&quot; or &quot;only a smartphone-based platform will work, thus PC-based work is doomed.&quot; Or &quot;you should be working on virtual tourism apps, that&#x27;s the only thing people are going to want to buy, hardcore games are too small of a market to worry about.&quot;<p>That might be even worse than the visionless naysayer problem, because the complete skeptic is most likely only so because he is ignorant, whereas these guys are quickly becoming a new form of religious zealot. I&#x27;m still waiting for the doom of the (PC|console|mobile|casual|hardcore|client|server|centralized|decentralized|what have you) market that has been predicted ever since I can remember. And regardless of what will be the <i>most</i> popular, why should one ever preclude the other? The market is vast and diverse! Work on what you want! Failure to find a market is not proof of the lack of a market.<p>I&#x27;m actively working in VR right now. We talk about &quot;the community&quot;, but there is no community. There&#x27;s very little interpersonal support. I think everyone has a fear that, unless they are the first to market with a killer app, then they are doomed to languish in obscurity and aren&#x27;t going to make anything important. Maybe it&#x27;s because everyone thinks it&#x27;s going to be like the smartphone app market gold rush. If you don&#x27;t get in early, there will be no money for you.<p>And it&#x27;s a good point, if you forget that the bulk of the app market is junk. Of course the 200th compass app isn&#x27;t going to make any money. Yes, Flappy Bird shouldn&#x27;t have been such a runaway success. But it was just another Pet Rock, and that lack of predictability in the market should be a sign that the consumers <i>aren&#x27;t</i> completely jaded yet and <i>are</i> looking for novel experiences. Who would have predicted the success of WhatsApp, which got started long <i>after</i> everyone declared the gold rush dead?<p>What I see is that the majority of the VR developers right now are going down much the same road of style over substance, cranking out a ton of apps versus spending time on a quality app. Part of that is timeline: we&#x27;ve only just now reached a point where anyone could have had enough time to develop something meaningful. But I fear that part of it is just the way we&#x27;ve trained developers to act, with all of the cheesehead &quot;growth hacking&quot; and &quot;SEO&quot; emphasis over solid art and engineering.<p>And I know, I&#x27;m engaging in criticism when complaining about criticism. But come on, you have to be able to see the difference. Let&#x27;s make a real community of <i>developers</i>, not petulant children all trying to one-up each other.

While the need to protect sensitive sources and methods precludes us from sharing all of this information, our conclusion is based, in part, on the following:<p>* Technical analysis of the data deletion malware used in this attack revealed links to other malware that the FBI knows North Korean actors previously developed. For example, there were similarities in specific lines of code, encryption algorithms, data deletion methods, and compromised networks.\n* The FBI also observed significant overlap between the infrastructure used in this attack and other malicious cyber activity the U.S. government has previously linked directly to North Korea. For example, the FBI discovered that several Internet protocol (IP) addresses associated with known North Korean infrastructure communicated with IP addresses that were hardcoded into the data deletion malware used in this attack.\n* Separately, the tools used in the SPE attack have similarities to a cyber attack in March of last year against South Korean banks and media outlets, which was carried out by North Korea.&quot;<p>As you will note, all of these are circumstantial and none is conclusive. Hackers can reuse malware developed by others, and it is possible to fake identifying information to make it appear as if it is the work of North Koreans.<p>Many security experts are not convinced just from the publicly available information, but the feeling is that the conclusion must be based on unreleased info, perhaps human or signals intelligence.<p>So at this point, for Americans at least, it&#x27;s based on how much you trust your government to tell the truth. It&#x27;s telling to see the amount of scepticism here. I&#x27;m South Korean, and we may be more willing to blame North Koreans not because we have access to conclusive evidence but because we have been following related news more here. While the international audience seems surprised that such a supposedly technically backward country could be behind the hacking, South Korea has already experienced a couple of major attacks that were blamed on North Korean hacking units, later described by defectors who allegedly worked in such a unit based in China. We also have been reading about how unhappy North Korea was about The Interview long before the hacking. Again, this is all circumstantial evidence, but it makes it easier for us to accept the FBI&#x27;s conclusion.<p>In the end, what you choose to believe is based on your worldview.",1419266024

First of all, I&#x27;m not into suing potential employers; it tends to burn bridges, waste money, and just make things worse overall.<p>Secondly, go prove it.  I mean, I&#x27;ve applied for hundreds of jobs over the years, and most of them either never answer, or interview me then decline to offer, or sometimes put me on hold and a few months later ask me to come fill a different position. Who am I to conclude that it&#x27;s all about age?<p>There are so many factors involved that isolating age as <i>the</i> main reason for being passed over is difficult if not impossible.  Of course, companies sometimes do settle out of court just to avoid the expense and bad press associated with defending themselves, but that just feeds the lawsuit beast and I&#x27;m really against frivolous lawsuits and the horrific effect they&#x27;ve had on our society.<p>Thirdly, why would I, at my current stage in life, want to be an employee of a company run by and full of 20-somethings who are young enough to be my sons (or, occasionally, daughters ;)?  I have been there, and I find myself cringing to watch Junior say and do silly things.  The father in me tells me to let him go ahead and make his mistakes because that&#x27;s part of growing up.  The politician in me tells me to keep my mouth shut and look for something better.<p>Nope, although I&#x27;m quite fortunate right now to have a work-from-home full time job designing and writing web apps and mobile apps for a living, if I found myself out of work I&#x27;d probably try to start my own consulting business or otherwise try to make it free-lancing and partnering with other app writers and designers rather than go and try to be a code monkey at a 20-something start-up.  Or try to start my own start-up, for that matter.<p>The 20-somethings (except for a few cool, mature-beyond-their-years ones) don&#x27;t relate to me, because they&#x27;re young and inexperienced.  I can relate to them, however, but I have already been through that awkward phase of life and have little interest in reliving it!<p>Frankly I&#x27;m surprised that so many 40-somethings and 50-somethings really want to work in such an environment.  A friend of mine in SV complains about his manager who is half his age, who said &quot;convert this script from Python to Java; it shouldn&#x27;t take you more than half an hour&quot; and in fact it took my friend two weeks.  Come on, if it takes half an hour then do it yourself, hotshot.

Control VR intrigues me but my gut feeling is it&#x27;ll be a while before their products are available on the market (see Myo band for example, it took a while for them to fulfill the orders and the product still has some issues based on the last hackathon I attended)[2]. Regardless, it&#x27;s an exciting area (bit niche) but hopefully there will be a solution soon.<p>[1]<a href=""http://www.breqlabs.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.breqlabs.com</a><p>[2]<a href=""http://www.betakit.com/team-raisins-wins-sportshack-2014-torontos-first-sports-wearables-hackathon/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.betakit.com/team-raisins-wins-sportshack-2014-tor...</a>",1419264245

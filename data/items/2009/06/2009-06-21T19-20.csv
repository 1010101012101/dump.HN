The system will be gamed to maximize cashflow from US tax dollars to crony corporations. That's the rationale behind Medicare today and that's the rationale behind downsizing the military and hiring back the soldiers we just downsized as mercenaries. That's the rationale behind corn ethanol subsidies.<p>So drug prices (to the government) go up, but drug prices (to the consumer) drop to some arbitrary low level. What do you think will happen then? People will use more prescription drugs. Now the cost to society is even higher, because the inflated subsidies (which in more honest terms might be called ""kickbacks"") by the government combined with the total lack of spending discipline on the part of the consumer result in an even higher increase to the tax burden and the federal deficit. Which must be dealt with in some way (taxation or inflation) that makes us all a bit poorer.<p>It is a fallacy to assume that individuals make perfectly rational economic decisions on behalf of themselves, but it's closer to the truth than supposing that <i>governments</i> make perfectly rational economic decisions on behalf of the people at large.",1245614271

667688,comment,667411,667411,0,0,iamelgringo,,,"Mr. Freidman discounts a little too quickly the incredible changes and advances in technology in the past 60 years.  If you consider per capita technology spending in the last 60 years, I suspect there might be a suprising correlation to health care spending.<p>In 1946, oxygen administration was considered ""advanced"".  Penicillin and sulfa antibiotics were just begining regular use in World War II.  Before that people died from infections like pneumonia very frequently.  Diseases like polio, smallpox, measles, tetanus, mumps, were devastating and crippling diseases.  We rarely see those any more.  Advances in microbioligy and pharmacology have greatly reduced morbidity and mortality.  It's harder than it used to be to die from an infectuous disease in a country with modern healthcare.<p>But, people in the US now have a cultural expectation that medicine can dramatically fix or cure a lot of diseases, like we did with microbial diseases.  But, the diseases that we are left with tend to be chronic and a lot harder to cure: heart disease, diabetes, cancer.  Low hanging fruit are easiest to pick.<p>15 years ago, when I started my nursing career the state of the art in emergency heart attack treatment was a $1000 single dose of a clot busting medication.  1 out of 20 people bled to death from that cure.  So, $300,000 emergency heart catheterization and angioplasty was developed to limit the 5% mortality rate.<p>One of the big focuses in the US medicine is technological innovation and critical care, because that's what our insurance pays for.  The focus in many other developed nations is primary care, prevention and cost effective treatments.<p>Also, other areas of technological innovation benefit from exponential decrease in costs because of Moore's law.  Medical and biological technology have the inherit limitation of the human body.  That's going to influence cost structures dramatically in comparison to other technologies.",1245612445

We're using a combination of plain-English descriptions of the various codes and some predictive modeling to try to get you to the right code.  We can't guarantee anything there, but we're hoping we can narrow it down to a small subset and give you a pretty good idea of what your out-of-pocket is going to be.",1245611175

Those considerations are indeed weighed... all in a context of how much it costs! If you can't understand it in an emotional arena like health care, consider buying a house. Price isn't the only concern. How much you like it factors in to your final decision. But if you don't consider price <i>at all</i>, you're going to make a very bad decision by any measure, both conventional (you're going to run out of money) and economic utility.<p>""Yes, I by drugs at Costco because they are cheaper, but that is because Costco has negotiating advantage, not me.""<p>Time for some 5 Whys: <i>Why</i> does Costco have a negotiating advantage? Because they are big? Well, <i>why</i> are they big? You can dance around all you like, but you're going to have to come back to ""Because they have you and many other people as customers, and Costco can aggregate <i>your</i> bargaining power together."" If Costco screws up and alienates enough customers, they will have no more bargaining power. This is a critical aspect of economic theory. Your conception of Costco as a sort of platonic ideal of a large company, with this fact disconnected from the input of the rest of the economy, is very wrong. Costco's bargaining power is an effect, not just a cause.<p>I commend to you a lot of time with a textbook: <a href=""http://www.daviddfriedman.com/Academic/Price_Theory/PThy_ToC.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.daviddfriedman.com/Academic/Price_Theory/PThy_ToC...</a><p>And I remind, it is not necessarily because ""economic theory"" must be right... it is because it is objectively true that you don't understand it.

This is such utter crap that it is hard to believe that an open minded economist would utter it. Health purchases are not rationally economic. They are made on other considerations like trust in the doctor and increasingly on patient evaluations of treatment options. If you have a kid with a high fever, you dont start googling for the best price.</i><p>You could reasonably compress ""rational economic decisions"" to be ones considering two factors: price and quality. It sounds like you're arguing that people are often willing to pay a lot for high quality healthcare. I think you're correct that people seek high quality healthcare, especially for their children, but I disagree that this implies the consumer isn't making a rational economic decision. The economic term you're looking for is elasticity. It sounds like you're claiming that demand for high-quality healthcare is inelastic. Inelasticity is a well-understood concept, not one that destroys economic analysis.<p>My impression is that people are cost-conscious when purchasing healthcare. I myself have shopped around for various services. A friend of mine shopped between services in Panama and India for surrogate pregnancy services, and cost was a factor. I've heard that there is a lot of traffic across the Mexico-USA border, and the Canada-USA border, of people seeking cheaper prices. My decisions to purchase from online pharmacies have been driven by price comparisons, and online pharmacies are very popular so I doubt I'm unusual.<p>These things indicate that cost is a factor at least for some people, when considering healthcare expenditures. I think that Milton Friedman's perception of cost-conscious health consumers was correct.",1245610820

That's mainly how WWII was so positive for the U.S. economy: we were selling to the allies for several years before we got directly involved.

Your goal is to make $100,000 a year and you are willing to use any legitimate means to get there.  Should you attempt to program better, such that your bosses reward your increased productivity every year with a 4% raise instead of a 2% raise?  No, that is poor strategy.  First, your bosses are likely incapable of measuring the delta between you at present and you after improving skills.  Second, you could likely get the same amount of <i>perceived</i> improvement for far less work just by improving your communication/political skills and getting the credit for the work you are <i>already</i> doing.  Third, even if you're successful, you're going to spend the next six years of your life working to achieve something you could in about an afternoon: apply for new job, negotiate aggressively on salary.<p>I don't like sounding mercenary: you can apply this to almost anything else you value.  Want to spend more time with your kids?  Being a better programmer will <i>probably</i> not get you home any faster at night, or get you more days off.  Want to have your job have more impact on the lives of poor immigrants in your community?  Process improvements in programming at your insurance agency are not likely to get you there.  etc, etc",1310146893

It's incredibly silly when people ""count"" lines of code like this. If you want to talk about lines of code in any kind of practical way, the code you're referring to really needs to be at least somewhat sanely formatted according to the conventions of whatever language you're in. Otherwise, any given sample of code can be in {1,2,3,...,# of characters in program} lines of code. You should just count characters (which is the more appropriate thing to do when you're trying to write a compressed program anyway). A metric of lines of code = ceil(characters/80) is weird because a) it's relatively arbitrary (in that it has nothing to do with languages but with the conventions of terminals), and b) it goes against the more common understanding of ""lines of code"".<p>/rant<p>I think compressed (edit: golfed - new word of the day :) code in general is pretty cool, though.",1310146059

2743270,comment,2742050,2742620,12,0,ugh,,,"The supply situation of the ISS is quite interesting.<p>Soyuz[1], the Russian spacecraft, will continue bringing and returning people to and from the ISS (three each  seven is a typical Space Shuttle crew). Two Soyuz will continue to be permanently docked to the ISS (they will, of course, be regularly switched out whenever a new Soyuz flies to the ISS) and serve as lifeboats for the ISSs crew of six. They are actually the limiting factor for the crew size  an evacuation of everyone on the ISS has to be possible at all times.<p>Soyuz will be the only spacecraft that can return something to Earth after the Shuttle retires. Since its designed to fly people and not cargo its certainly easy to imagine that Soyuz is far from ideal for this job  forget bringing back any big experiments.<p>Progress[2] is the unmanned cargo version of Soyuz. It will continue bringing cargo to the ISS. (Two to three tons per flight. The shuttle could bring about 25 tons to low earth orbit.) Its, just like Soyuz, a very capable and reliable work horse. (It was the only spacecraft bringing cargo to the ISS when the Shuttles were grounded between 2003 and 2005.)<p>There are two other and newer cargo spacecraft: The European Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV[3]) and the Japanese H-II Transfer Vehicle (HTV[4]). The ATV automatically (like its name indicates) docks to the Russian part of the ISS and can bring up more than seven tons of cargo. It can also boost the station into a higher orbit (as is regularly necessary). The second ATV Johannes Kepler only recently successfully finished its mission, was filled with trash, undocked and burned up in the atmosphere.<p>The HTV can bring about six tons of cargo to the ISS. It has a pressurized and an unpressurized cargo section (meaning anything thats supposed to be attached somewhere outside the ISS doesnt have to go through and fit through the airlock, it can be brought to the ISS in the unpressurized cargo section). It has no complicated automated approach system like the ATV, it is simply grappled by the Canadian robot arm (well, its more a crane than a robot, really[5]) and attached to the American part of the ISS. Since its docking to the American part of the station, the docking hatch is large enough to accommodate International Standard Payload Racks[6] which are used everywhere in the non-Russian part of the ISS. The ATV cant bring those racks to the ISS since it docks to the Russian part of the station (and their hatches are too small). The HTV also only recently successfully finished its second mission and burned up in the atmosphere.<p>Thats the current situation, I will leave it to someone else to explain what the future might hold (SpaceXs Dragon spacecraft, for example). Bringing cargo back from the ISS is the only real problem, there will only be Soyuz after the Shuttle retires.<p>The ISS can currently also not be extended, well, at least not the non-Russion part. Bringing up all the modules was a job the Shuttle was perfectly suited for. Thats no problem since the ISS is done. They actually managed to pretty much complete it, even looking at the original plans. Heck, even the Cupola[7] made it.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soyuz_(spacecraft)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soyuz_(spacecraft)</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progress_spacecraft"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progress_spacecraft</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_Transfer_Vehicle"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_Transfer_Vehicle</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-II_Transfer_Vehicle"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-II_Transfer_Vehicle</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadarm2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadarm2</a><p>[6] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Standard_Payload_Rack"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Standard_Payload_...</a><p>[7] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cupola_(ISS_module)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cupola_(ISS_module)</a>",1310145318

3610532,comment,3610129,3610129,20,0,rweba,,,"(1) I object to the use of the term ""stole"" - there is no indication that the Forbes blogger did anything unethical. She gave links and full attribution to the NYT article and therefore helped to promote it. YES, the quotes from it are more extensive and lengthy than you would normally see but on the other hand it IS a NINE page article so I am pretty sure the excerpts still falls under Fair Use.<p>(2) The article in question is a feature article in the NYT Sunday magazine which is where they put the long in-depth articles which took months to investigate. These are meant to be Pulitzer Prize level pieces that will get people talking and make a big splash in the news cycle. This explains both the length and the title. There is NO WAY the NYT Sunday Magazine is going to lead with a sensationalist headline like How Target Figured Out A Teen Girl Was Pregnant Before Her Father Did. That smacks of The National Enquirer or something. The title they actually used (How Companies Learn Your Secrets) is not THAT bad either - it got me to click on it when I saw it.<p>(3) Most importantly, I don't see how Facebook Likes can be the sole metric of an article's ""success."" This weeks NYT Sunday Magazine is just officially coming out today. This is a front page article. Lots of people are going to be reading,talking and emailing it all week. And when they do they are going to send the link to the source and NYT will get the credit.<p>(4) Lastly,  - no evidence is given that the TITLE was the SOLE reason why the Forbes post went viral. It is an interesting topic and the Forbes blogger adequately summarized it, making the post very ""shareable."" The promotion and SEO strategies of Forbes may also have helped.<p>So in summary the Forbes blog and the NYT magazine are very different types of publications and it looks like they both succeeded in what they were trying to do.",1329688105

To my pleasant surprise that is the central topic of the discussion.<p>Many have argued for prolonging the life span of humans to the point of immortality. Its a thought provoking idea to entertain. One comment ponders rhetorically, wouldn't it be nice to have Einstein and Tesla around.<p>Not only am I ok with right to die, I absolutely covet it. Not just for myself but the entire society.  I am not so sure about ""right to life"", though it might seem such a  no-brainer,<p>Though we use the word ""right"" they are often privileges and the important question to think over is who gets to exercise the privileges. That is never uniform, it always comes down to who has the wherewithal to secure that privilege. It is this that causes me to worry.<p>Sure it would be great to have Socrates and Einstein with us if they chose to, we don't know if they would have. Many assholes would, but more seriously, one can conjecture that the dictators who were not defeated but died naturally would probably choose to live. World history would be a lot different. Would authoritarian regimes live longer ? Difficult to answer.<p>Then there is the question of ideas. Ideas, both good and bad, they often die not because better ideas replace them, but because their champions die. I don't know whether this is an argument in favor of or against prolonging life, but the need to discuss it will only become more urgent over the years.",1329687884

If I find an interesting academic paper that I think HN might like, just submitting it by itself rarely goes anywhere, because there isn't space to explain why I think it's of interest to HN. Oddly enough it actually stands a better chance on Reddit, because you have about one sentence worth of space in the submission title to explain it. On HN, it's better if you reblog the paper with a one- or two-paragraph blurb, catchy title, and then submit that instead of the original paper. People will then complain that you submitted blogspam instead of the original, <i>but</i> most of the time they'll upvote it more than they would've upvoted the original despite the complaints.",1329687841

In my effort to try to figure out how to claim my income, aka ""do the right thing"", I submitted a 1099-MISC form, which apparently was a grave error.  Since then, I've been trying to convince the IRS that I submitted the form in error, all the while with them sending me increasing bills for taxes and penalties on income I didn't actually received.  I just got another letter last week.<p>As it turns out, what I should have done was nothing.  Instead of trying to figure out the proper, ""by the book"" procedure, I would have been much better off if I had either A) done nothing or B) just reported it as some kind of supplemental income on my 1040 or whatever.<p>The lesson I learned is that strict rules and procedures in any system that largely involves humans can usually be ignored, at least on the first pass.

Whether it is an increase of 100 to 1000 sales or 1000 to 100000 it does not matter as a 10x increase in sales is not seen without some kind of justification. What PRNDL Development Studios was able to do with the resources available, at the time, supports our initial belief that using social media does have a direct relation to interest, and ultimately demand, for a product or service. Social Media was the only changed variable from November (as well as previous months in 2010 and 2011) to December 2011/January 2012. Even the expected growth in sales from the holiday season does not account for the growth we have experienced (expected growth in sales for '10-'11 was about 3x, but only lasted a week into January '11). The thing about social media and marketing is that word travels fast on the web. If PRNDL was able to get just one of our ""105"" followers to buy or RT one of our tweets then their followers also see it and could do likewise. It turns into a chain reaction, so the initial user base is not even a concern as long as you have engaging users who are interested in your product. If you wanted to be realistic in your charge that our follower and like counts are too small to matter, you should actually use the sum of all of our followers and friends list to those who like us on facebook to consider if it could have a factor on revenue.<p>We are only encouraging other businesses to pursue social media ventures.

People usually have to schedule appointments with their hair salon - that is not maximum convenience, it's maximum value. There are more banks outside of Walmart than inside of Walmart, and that will continue to be the case. Walmart is an extremely small part of the US furniture market. And so on.<p>Walmart wanted to take over the gasoline fill-up market. What could be more convenient? Instead, gas stations have thrived living near Walmart, because convenience doesn't always maximize value. Gas stations draw people with gasoline, and make money on in-store purchases; that model didn't work for Walmart, because gasoline doesn't draw people to spend an hour shopping at Walmart, so the value-add was non-existent.<p>The notion of extreme convenience fails as often as it succeeds in my opinion. It's why Walmart doesn't own every category. It's why GameStop exists. Specialization can just as easily trump maximum convenience, you have to offer enough of a value proposition. It's why Starbucks and Apple Stores exist; it's also why dollar stores are thriving.

You're assuming in this comment the value-type vs. object-type dichotomy that's used in, e.g., C#. That's one way to go, but I'm not sold that it's the best way. Deciding whether you want something to be storable inline in arrays or not when you define a type is kind of a strange thing. Maybe sometimes you do and sometimes you don't. So the bigger question is really if that's the best way to go about the matter.<p>It seems that in dynamically typed languages, you either need to have two kinds of objects (value types vs. object types), or two kinds of storage slots (e.g. arrays that hold values inline vs. arrays that hold references to heap-allocated values). The boxing aspect is really only part of that since you can't get the shared-reference behavior unless the storage is heap-allocated, regardless of whether there's a box header or not.<p>So yeah, it's a complicated issue.",1329685647

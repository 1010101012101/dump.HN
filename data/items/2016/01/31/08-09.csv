11005798,comment,11001693,11001693,0,0,tikwidd,,,"I use PowerBuilder (of Sybase) at my job. We have a database centric stack mainly built with stored procedures and PowerBuilder works pretty well (PowerBuilder datawindows just represent a SELECT query or point to a stored procedure). It&#x27;s very legacy. The syntax is similar to BASIC, with some SQL database querying built in as a kind of DSL. The built-in string and array libraries are particularly bad.<p>The Powerbuilder IDE rebuilds the object you&#x27;re working on whenever you save, so if there are any errors you can&#x27;t save the file from within the IDE. You can&#x27;t view or edit a script and its ancestor at the same time. When source control is switched on, you can&#x27;t save a file without checking it out first - but you can&#x27;t check it out without closing it and discarding any changes you made. I usually have Notepad++ open alongside PowerBuilder at all times.",1454230774

Quoting from the article:<p>> &quot;The job of the watch is to do more and more things on your wrist so that you don’t need to pick up your phone as often.&quot;<p>> &quot;The job of the phone is to do more and more things such that maybe you don’t need your iPad, and it should be always trying and striving to do that.&quot;<p>> &quot;The job of the iPad should be to be so powerful and capable that you never need a notebook. Like, why do I need a notebook? I can add a keyboard! I can do all these things!&quot;<p>> &quot;The job of the notebook is to make it so you never need a desktop, right? It’s been doing this for a decade.&quot;<p>> &quot;[The job of the Mac] is to challenge what we think a computer can do, and do things that no computer has ever done before—[it should] be more and more powerful and capable so that we need a desktop because of its capabilities.&quot;<p>I can relate to what Phil Schiller is saying. For me, the Apple Watch become more useful once I stopped having the phone in my hand all the time.<p>Nowadays I either leave the phone on my desk or leave it in my pocket and accomplish basic tasks on the Watch. Checking OmniFocus, checking Fantastical, calling Uber, answering calls, making quick iMessage reply, turn-by-turn navigation, etc. You could say these tasks are boring and could be done on a phone. But the point is that I can do it on my wrist without picking up the phone, which, sometimes, very convenience to have both of my hands free.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://fortune.com/2015/12/04/schiller-apple-theory/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fortune.com/2015/12/04/schiller-apple-theory/</a>",1454230717

11005791,story,,,2,2,gamuni,"I'm working on an open source app that will allow checking sports bets for value",,"In order to gain experience of development in Meteor rapidly, I&#x27;m building two open source projects related to gambling. The first one will do what the title says. I have a plan mapped out for it and I&#x27;ve done more than 30% of the work. But I need to hear other people out: what checks do you want for your bets? I&#x27;m talking about the type of checks that would desconsider a bet in your eyes; I know from my own experience that sometimes it&#x27;s hard to let go of them. But when you want to bet and the app will tell you &quot;no&quot; and offer valid reasons, maybe you&#x27;ll actually listen. Here’s an example with the two most basic checks I can think about:<p>- First thing, to get it out of the way and not have the user influenced by the subsequent tasks, ask for a percentage based probability on how often will the event occur. For example: do you want to bet that Real Madrid will win instead of drawing or losing in their next match? How often do you think that would happen? 85%. OK, let’s go to step 2.\n- Input the odds, calculate the bookmaker margin, compare it with the averages for that event and so on. The checks will get more complicated as it goes on. I have a certain flow in mind.<p>The interface is beautiful and it allows for events with any number of outcomes and odds expressed in these formats: fractional, decimal and moneyline. For this reason it will also be helpful to people that bet on things like 1x2 and horse races, not just for handicappers.",1454230494

It seems that you are blocking all threads at one rendez-vous point and that seems too radical, though. Also, &quot;underthreads&quot; could result in a unbalanced system where one thread does most of the work while others are waiting. Automatic ways to distribute code among tasks exist in synchronous language (I don&#x27;t think synchronous languages necessarily sacrifice performance).<p>It seems you did a lot of work on the parser and compiler. You also use synchronized variable which seems a little odd: you say that &quot;[...] the programmer doesn’t\nhave to worry about the order in which a synchronized variable is written to by\nthe different threads.&quot;. Do different threads really want to write the same variable during one timestep?<p>You mention Esterel and synchronous languages.\nI am not sure Esterel (or Quartz[1]) is the most widely used implementation. I would bet on Scade, a child of Lustre, but I am not sure.\nAs you say they support a way to distribute code among execution units and Signal[2] in particular is designed to make it easy and efficiently compilable.<p>In Signal, you define processes and map them to different  execution units through a &quot;RunOn&quot; directives. The Signal compiler then statically compute the order by which I/O and computations are executed on each concurrent thread (posix threads and fifos or MPI). There is also a lot to say about logical clocks which allow to transmit only the necessary information to synchronize distributed code.\nThe result is very little scheduling code: only signal/wake instructions surrounding sequential code with nested &quot;if&quot; blocks for clocks (activation condition).<p>So while you did a lot of work for this language, I fail to see where your approach is beneficial compared to older ones. I mean, existing languages surely could be improved, but what could convince a user to switch to this one? (a hard question, sorry).<p>[1] <a href=""https://es.cs.uni-kl.de/publications/datarsg/Schn09.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://es.cs.uni-kl.de/publications/datarsg/Schn09.pdf</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIGNAL_(programming_language)"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIGNAL_(programming_language)</a>",1454227504

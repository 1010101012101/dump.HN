502705,comment,501696,502368,0,0,froo,,,"The majority of cost of any TV/Film project goes into equipment and salary realistically.<p>The way I figure it, the minimum number of people you need in any traditional production is essentially the cast and base operators (which could also be cast members if multi-skilled)<p>However if you go into 3D animation, this number can actually go down - to the point where you have a content production team around the size of a small startup.<p>The model I'm looking at could be described as a digital aniation studio, a ""mini pixar"" if you will, that uses open source software (Blender, Cinelerra) and homebrew motion capture (both facial and performance) to get performance across in a quick manner and using a significantly smaller team. I'm also looking at leveraging EC2 for rendering instead of investing in purchasing multiple servers for a render farm.<p>The model isn't scalable across the entire film/tv industry of course, but I figure it could work for a couple studios and this is what I'm working on trying to prove right now.",1236156463
502704,comment,501844,501844,0,0,jeroen,,,"The problem to be solved was ""it was in the interest of the lender to keep mortgage holders owing as much as possible for as long as possible"".<p>The broker solved that by having his customers pay him a one time fee, which aligns their interests: now they both want the loan to be paid off as soon as possible. It saves the customer money and the broker time.<p>And then Cringely changes the one time fee to a monthly payment, which seems to me like going back to square one. Home-Account is motivated to improve your situation just enough to keep you a happy customer, but also to keep you as a customer for as long as possible.",1236156383

Most journal sites give the googlebot open access to index their content, so it is a great way to find things instead of pubmed, which only searches abstracts.</i><p>That's called web spamming or spamdexing via cloaking.  I find it incredibly frustrating because they point you to what you want, but then you're often stuck.  Do you really want to pay $30-$50 for a paper that may or may not have what you want?  And Google is complicit in this, it's not just the publishers.  They know it's advertising, so they charge them for it, but the results are not presented as paid ads.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spamdexing"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spamdexing</a><p><a href=""http://www.webreference.com/authoring/search_engines/cloaking/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.webreference.com/authoring/search_engines/cloakin...</a>",1236156381

502692,comment,501696,502551,0,0,menloparkbum,,,"Having made a video that was sold on DVD and been a TA for a university course, I'm pessimistic that any university lecturer would bother with the extra work to make the videos good. I had no idea before I did it, but video editing is hugely time consuming. I'm guessing to make a really good video lecture you'd have to spend about 10-20 hours per lecture. Hours prepping the slides, the room, coordinating 2 camera guys, syncing audio after the fact, editing the video, etc.<p>sketerpot's comments are great, but I'm a pessimist. With current tools it would take too much work from the lecturer to make truly good videos. My point was that at a bare minimum if you somehow could make what's appearing on the board visible in the video, you'd at least make the experience as useful as being in the class. As it stands now, you're better off just listening to the audio.<p>However, there's a lot of room for technical innovation. Software to help automate the production work needed to make good lecture videos would be a cool startup idea.",1236155514

Two of the legal ones, I believe, are the porn picture sets. They are used to promote pay porn content and I will give the uploader the benefit of the doubt here. The other one is someone's collection of recipe for Indian food. I'm similarly assuming that his collection of recipes is not copyrighted, but 15.9MB of recipes is a lot of personal recipes.<p>Look: I am not in favor of the current system of IP. I think it is ridiculous to artificially add some constraint of scarcity when the marginal cost of duplication has fallen to zero. But we're reasonable here, we're not in court. We don't need to defend TPB using legalistic arguments. We can just be happy that a group of high powered lawyers turned out to be completely incompetent.",1236155277
502687,comment,501696,502434,0,0,menloparkbum,,,"<i>I wonder if the entertainment industry is headed to a model comparable to venture capitalism.</i><p>Isn't it like this already? Shows like 30 Rock and The Late Show are created by production companies owned by Tina Fey and David Letterman. The shows are jointly owned by the production companies and the star's production companies. Even smaller potatoes productions are owned by production companies, not the networks. I.e. all that crap like ""Rob and Big"" on MTV is joint owned by MTV and a production company owned by some random dudes.<p>The finance and ownership issues relating to TV and Film are probably more sophisticated than high-tech venture capital.",1236154958

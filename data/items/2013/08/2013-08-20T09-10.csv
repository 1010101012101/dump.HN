Lectures are as effective as many other methods, but not more so. There are indications that lecturing is less effective, even for imparting information, than certain methods, notably unsupervised reading. (In fact unsupervised reading may have the edge over all face-to-face teaching methods for factual mastery).&quot; (In case this sounds overly positive about lecturing, note that the author considers factual transfer to be lecturing&#x27;s strongest feature)<p>It&#x27;s only a broad review of what was considered fairly obvious research conclusions, he specifically says that he&#x27;s not writing to present new evidence just to note that despite the evidence no change in behaviour has occurred, and as I say, it was written 30 years ago, but I&#x27;m not aware of anything more recent overturning these results.<p>It&#x27;s not clear but I believe his source for this particular claim is the Bligh book which is cited explicitly elsewhere in the text, which summarizes hundreds of studies comparing the effectiveness of lecturing with other techniques in his book &quot;What&#x27;s the use of lectures&quot;.<p>(Amusing aside: The review snippet of Bligh&#x27;s book on Google books is as follows: &quot;A large portion of this book is dedicated to presenting research on why and how lectures fail. You really have to wade through a lot of material to get to any help in putting a lecture together&quot;.

Of course it doesn&#x27;t help that the Space Shuttle and therefore the ISS were hopelessly cost inefficient, but even without the shuttle tax space exploration is still very costly.<p>This is why SpaceX&#x27;s plans for substantially reusable launch vehicles is so exciting. They have a credible roadmap towards cutting launch costs by a factor of ten or more. We&#x27;re in one of those situations where yes, we could spend more billions on space exploration right now, but there&#x27;s a very real chance that if we maintain current space spending for just a few years those extra billions could buy us a huge amount more.

You never hear &quot;NodeJS has HTTPish module&quot;, nor do you read documentation of that module&#x27;s concepts and behaviour. Those are defined in the spec, and the __fill_in_with_any_language__ HTTP module just implements those definitions.<p>- Optimizations, simplifications, corrections should be done in the spec, whenever the you find them at implementation-time.<p>But until now there has not been <i>ONE</i> HTTP server that grasps and handles the HTTP specs in their whole. So then, I find it hilarious to read that about optimizations when neither of us have the whole picture.<p>That said, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s Node.js to blame here (albeit they do have weird views of standards: <a href=""https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/4850"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/4850</a>) but HTTP itself because the spec&#x27;s abstraction levels have been far away from the implementations&#x27; reach.

Here is a link that explains it very well: <a href=""http://www.helloerik.com/bootstrap-3-grid-introduction"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.helloerik.com/bootstrap-3-grid-introduction</a><p>I have used the release candidates for my own personal website and it has been a pretty good experience. However I liked the result I got with Bootstrap 2 more.<p>To say it upfront: I am not a web developer. I am doing something completely different professionally. But maybe that makes my experience with Bootstrap kinda interesting :)<p>I had the main problem with the mobile first grid system. It changed quite a lot when compared to Bootstrap 2. I made a product page for my new app and I wanted to show thumbnails. When using the built in thumbnail class wierd things happen when you resize the window: The actual size of the thumbnail changes and it gets distorted as a result.<p>Also the new grid system has the effect - at least in my case - that when resizing the window, the overall width of the columns that contain my text expand even though I made the window smaller. And then when I make the window even smaller the columns containing my text are becoming less wide. I think this is because of the fluid layout.<p>Personally I do not like fluid websites at all. Maybe I should not have used bootstrap then but I had some experience with it What I liked about the non fluid grid system in Bootstrap 2 was that your website looked more or less the same on desktop and on mobile. On mobile the first thing you would see is a scaled down version of your website with the structure in tact. If you wanted to see the details you would have to zoom in. Now Bootstrap tries to be smart and transforms columns to rows This is obviously good if you want a fluid website.<p>When I had to do it again I would not use bootstrap again. Instead I would look for something that has a grid system like boostrap 2.",1376990609

Creating a huge lazy sequence that propagated through multiple call-layers was absolutely evil. Also, options, although strict, are troublesome across more than a couple of lines of code given the way they crash. In general, only use option if failure is expected, otherwise null is your friend!<p>For simple programs that do not need to be debugged, laziness is great, you can write some very concise code. Once you are debugging however, you want to expose as much control flow as possible to break and step through. I say this from writing 10s of thousands of Scala code in a fairly complicated context (Scala compiler + Eclipse) with non-trivial control flow (mostly event driven).",1376990422

Apparently international wire transfers aren&#x27;t very popular in Japans o they&#x27;re all processed manually, which doesn&#x27;t scale to what MtGox are doing.",1376989332

The very first step is to cut the circuit like you say, but there are a few things you overlooked.<p>Much of the video is concerned with instructing responders how to cut around components that may remain electrified such as the converter and capacitors which, in Tesla&#x27;s own words, present a &quot;serious hazard of shock&quot; because &quot;they can release up to 400 volts in just an instant.&quot;<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntK3rvVl2Qw"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntK3rvVl2Qw</a>",1376989217

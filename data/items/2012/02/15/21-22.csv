3596258,comment,3596128,3596128,9,0,eli,,,"> Q: What if all root name serves would stop answering queries?<p>> A: Now you are stretching it. How likely is that? The diversity in the system will prevent that from happening. But let's treat it as a hypothetical case: In that hypothetical case the Internet will not suddenly grind to a halt. If absolutely nothing is done to correct the situation every hour about 2% of all queries will not be answered, 2% at the end of the first hour, 4% at the end of the second hour and so forth until 48h after the root name servers stop answering queries no DNS names can be resolved anymore. However it is even more hypothetical to assume that nothing will be done to correct this hypothetical situation.<p>> Even in the hypothetically hypothetical case that the root name server operators would do nothing to correct the situation, the IANA, TLD operators, ISPs and others would have the motivation and the means to take corrective action.<p>> Again: this is very hypothetical. DNS failures outside the root name servers are much more likely. Name service for the vast majority of top-level domains is very much less redundant than that of the root name servers. Whole top-level domains and major corporations have been unreachable for significant amounts of time because of DNS failures. Name service for the root zone has always been available.<p><a href=""http://www.isoc.org/briefings/020/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.isoc.org/briefings/020/</a>",1329342640

To have any effect other than to make sys admins dehydrate anon have to keep the attack up long enough to have the caches empty (if they are indeed configured to flush even if they cannot connect to the root. They may not) and there are several layer deep caching (your isp is but one. Your local computer may also have one).<p>But assuming they can keep it running long enough for the DNS service to die(and they may very well, that flaw is pretty smart though they have to use the actual ip of the vulnerable DNS servers, which means that it can be filtered if the admins are smart enough)?

You have one guy who can go tell other people to do certain tasks.<p>Depends on the architecture, actually.  What you're describing is a lot like the Cell processor design.  For x86-based processors, it's much less organized than that, because each core is, for all intents and purposes, effectively an independent processor.<p>The best analogy for multithreaded programming I've come up with is a(take a drink) car factory.  Each core is a generalized assembly line that is capable of producing any part, but it takes time to switch to a different task.  The end goal is a car, which means that you can have one core working on the transmission, one core working on the interior parts, one on the exhaust, and one working on the motor.  If you can balance them out, you can have all of them finish around the same time.  But if you're trying to actually make a car, you're going to end up with some overhead to finish the entire thing.  There is some overhead where the body is made, and all the parts that were produced by the other lines are actually put into the car.<p>Compared to a single-assembly line factory, it's possible to make cars much faster with multiple lines.  But there will always be some percentage of time that you cannot split across multiple cores.",1329342300

For example, an Android app you install requires SMS permission.

So, you install a third party SMS client thinking you'll use it to send SMSes, but the app can send SMSes on its own, without you even seeing them.

Your users will likely never look at it (unless you are building something for JS developers) and the compression should really only be a step in your deploy (save, compress, run tests, deploy to server). So theoretically no one should ever look at the compressed files. That being said if you have a lot of JS it can really improve load times of sites but thats about it.<p>As for the 2 options you listed, there are 2 benefits of option 1 over 2 (given that no one is ever going to look at the compressed files). First, some JS compressors do a better job when they have all the files together as one large file. Second, consolidating them all down to 1 file significantly decreases the number of requests the client has to make to your server. This reason alone will probably have a bigger impact on your sites performance than compressing the files alone so I would definitely recommend you look into it.",1329340424

The most we could claim was that we could mitigate the disadvantages sufficiently wellfor example, by flying everyone out to California to present to investors at our Mountain View office. But we did worry that the Boston groups were losing out. Boston just doesnt have the startup culture that the Valley does. It has more startup culture than anywhere else, but the gap between number 1 and number 2 is huge; nothing makes that clearer than alternating between them.""",1329340005

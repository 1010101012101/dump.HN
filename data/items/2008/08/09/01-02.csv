If someone asks what I was doing in 2000, I'll tell them; and in the context of the (first) dot-com bubble and in a forum where VCs are discussed frequently, I don't think there's anything inappropriate about snickering at an idiotic VC who cold-called an undergraduate with no business experience solely on the basis of media reports saying that said undergraduate had done something in the ""hot"" area du jour.<p><i>I'd seriously never link to that thread again.</i><p>I only added the link to that thread because without that context anyone who arrived at news.yc in the past year would have no way to understand the joke.",1218246921

I'm not saying that their ubiquity makes them a good idea. I'm asking why nobody has gotten around to starting a company that avoids using them, and then gotten lots of great developers who work for less money because their freedom is maximized. If I found out that every landlord in my city enforced that rule, I would work hundred-hour weeks raising the money to buy an apartment that didn't enforce the rule, knowing I could charge a huge premium and get lots of residents.<p>As I've said in other contexts, most complaints about a purely capitalist system can be boiled down to a business plan -- and if nobody has done it, and you won't do it, what does that say about your complaint?",1218244855

Subtract pain if you have good or opportunistic connections; subtract pain if you are a superb salesman; also subtract pain if you have experience in this exact product field before.<p>Case 2, the pain is in attracting the initial set of customers.

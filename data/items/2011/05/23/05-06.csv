I spent hours exploring and building and chatting but never found any joy in it. It is an ugly, hollow and seedy world.<p>The Minecraft comparison is a good one. There is a world with purpose: to survive and ultimately control nature. It perfectly indulges our most primal instincts.<p>In contrast, everyone is a god in Second Life and the world is empty. For some reason, this ultimate power is used to recreate the most mundane and tasteless aspects of reality:<p>- Consumerism -- SL citizens <i>love</i> buying clothes, furniture and other useless junk even when they can create anything themselves.<p>- Lame commercial ""theme parks"" like McDonalds Island etc. Even the ones that should be interesting, like NASA, fail to either educate or entertain since the medium of static 3D models is generally terrible at both.<p>- And of course, vice: kinky sex, gambling, pyramid schemes, and spam. These things made up most of the metaverse, last time I was in it.<p>By far, the most interesting thing about SL was the elaborate and imaginative attacks on the world e.g. self-replicating objects, and the equally elaborate countermeasures used to fight back.<p>I guess the lesson is that a virtual world needs to find a balance between innate meaning and open ended creativity. SL is one extreme, the other being MMOs that involve too much carrot-chasing to interest most people.",1306129313

If the AUD fell back down to 80c US it's unlikely it would hurt the government, and might even help it. It would depend on other factors...<p>If the AUD falls then presumably we'll sell even more iron ore.<p>However, the high exchange rate is one factor in discouraging the RBA from raising interest rates (they don't want to encourage <i>more</i> capital inflows to take advantage of our already high interest rates). At the same time, the increase in the exchange rate has done a lot to combat inflation (imports cost less), but has distorted the price basket somewhat (foodstuffs cost a lot more compared to TVs now, for example). If inflation was higher then interest rate increases would be more likely.<p>But.. a high exchange rate helps protect the Australian housing market from foreign real-estate speculation, as it is relatively a lot more expensive.<p>But.. a lower exchange rate would help the tourism industry, which is a big employer of groups of people who have been unable to take advantage of the mining boom.<p>Conclusion: it's a brave person who predicts the political fortunes of a government based on exchange rate movement.",1306128568

2575050,comment,2574795,2574795,2,0,ChuckMcM,,,"As others have pointed out, the article's title is linkbait. The actual article says:<p>1) Second life lets people design levels.<p>2) This gets very expensive in bandwidth a high draw levels.<p>3) This makes it 'unplayable.' (aka a failure)<p>Clearly its not the case that its unplayable since a lot of people play it. Also the geometry / texture issue is huge when moving from place to place, but manageable when you're in one area. Thirdly the big draw for second life seems to be weird sex acts which are probably mostly mental anyway.<p>It is one of the few attempts at creating a Metaverse. As the author points out there is a tremendous asset management problem if you try to stream everything from the server. It could be improved.<p>Given modern disk drives I'm sure you could cache locally pretty much everywhere you went with some lookaside cache code to invalidate local copies when meta-data indicated an update. The author alludes to something like that by asking for a better architecture.<p>Now it would have been a bit more interesting if it was written from the perspective of ""this is what it does well, this is what doesn't work for me"" and then go on to speculate or do the math on how one might improve it.<p>I was looking that the NoSQL dB space as a metaverse management plane. It could work although everyones view of the world would only converge, not instantly be the same. You could use something like MongoDB, it would be read-mostly for geometry. Back when I designed a castle building MMO (never shipped sadly) the textures were fixed (all clients had them) but you could paint them on different geometries. It reduced the bandwidth requirements to sending around vertices and a texture vector (id, origin, u and v vectors). It would be fun to code something up like that with the Unreal engine.",1306128213

Here's an example from my personal life:<p>I like to rock climb on the weekends. Two of my favorite climbing destinations (I like them both for different reasons) have wildly different characteristics.<p>One is a top-roping area managed by the State Park Service and the management plan and local rock quality conspire to force you to utilize specific pre-planned routes. There are well-maintained trails and a parking lot up top. This is insanely convenient as you can just walk up, clip into anchors at the top of the crag, drop a rope, and you're in business. The convenience factor makes this a really great spot if you're taking out a group of inexperienced folks for their first time climbing. That's convenience.<p>The second area (in another state park) has no anchors of any kind. Parking is at the bottom a couple miles from the crag and to get to any of the climbs you're looking at a 45 minute hike uphill weighed down with a bunch of gear. The rock is also a lot taller here so toproping isn't an option, everything has to be lead from the ground up, on gear, with no pre-placed protection available. In non-climber terms this means you have to hang your ass out on the line and risk taking a fall on every climb you do there. You are totally free to pick any section of rock that suits your fancy, but this also means you have to be able to assess risk and know what you're about. That's freedom.",1306127755

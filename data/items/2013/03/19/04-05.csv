5399054,comment,5398407,5398407,5,0,lotyrin,,,"I think the Drupal community needs to get a really solid grip on what Drupal is (CMS) and how it compares to alternatives, and make sure they aren't leading people astray. There's this attitude that Drupal is some end-all solution to any web problem, when simply put, it's just a collection of many solutions to even greater (and growing) number of problems surrounding content.<p>If you want to capitalize on Drupal, your project needs to be well inside that problem set and you should have a tier of users that can and will learn arcane rituals and minutiae such as which of the five modules for X doesn't suck -- people who are going to be more productive doing so than if you were to have them writing code. These shouldn't be developers, these should be that class of person that is content to spend months complicating together a single spreadsheet, it's that same kind of work.<p>I've been doing Drupal full time for several years and I often say that if you're working on a Drupal project and you're in a code editor, you're probably doing something wrong. Most of the time, either there's a module for whatever you're doing, or you shouldn't have used Drupal.<p>Drupal agencies seem to sell Drupal as if it were bespoke development: hourly rates, design from scratch and lofty goals -- until it gets handed to a site builder ""developer"" who weeps because module X doesn't have support for module Y yet and fixing that properly exceeds the budget and their own skill set.<p>The Drupal service industry has to realize that Drupal and contrib is an IKEA and they should seek to serve clients as interior decorators do, not as carpenters - although I suspect it won't be quite as lucrative for them under that model, as well as many egos in the way.<p>Actual developers do exist in the ecosystem, but their time is best spent increasing the breadth and quality of the catalog of solutions for site builders, not cleaning up messes and creating endless one-off cludges on an over-promised project.<p>I've not yet had my conviction broken that there is a market for CMS, but whether Drupal is a suitable implementation of CMS, whether agencies can sell CMS properly, and whether I want to do this anymore are big questions for me right now.",1363669177

Los Angeles in particular turned into a free-for-all, with estimates of up to 1000 operating in LA county at one point, much to the chagrin of the NorCal MMJ community that has been pushing for legalization. Indeed, all the legal and industry advisers at Oakland's Oaksterdam University (of which I am a graduate) predicted in advance that the LA dispensary gold rush was on a collision course with the LA county authorities, which is exactly what happened. And while the feds conducted investigations up here in Norther California,  it's worth bearing in mind that they didn't actually shut anything down - Oaksterdam university is still taking students, major dispensaries like Harborside remain open and so on. If you look at the record of small dispensaries shut down in Northern California (where I live and pay more attention) you'll see that in almost every case it involved weapons charges or non-payment of taxes.<p><i>This administration has been one of the most aggressively anti-drug-law-reform administrations in the history of the war on drugs.</i><p>Yeah, just look at the abolition of the crack sentencing disparity.<p><i>The President has publicly (and falsely) stated that it is up to Congress to legalize marijuana.</i><p>This is correct.

Now when Lenovo is gone, their Precision series is probably the closest one to take advantage of this.<p>I would hope for the same, the only problem is that there has been some worrying tendencies in the Dell camp as well.<p>Look at the old Latitude series which was geared towards business [1]. It was solid, good keyboard, not a bundle of plastic etc. The design was new back in 2008 and now look what they turned it into [2]. It looks like a horrible mix between their all too plastic XPS series and the old Latitude. Also, doesn't it also look fat with those stupid rounded edges?<p>Honestly, the best laptop I know of out there is the Dell Latitude 2XXX series [3]. That although ridden with plastic, a not so good keyboard and a slow CPU, it is built like a brick (like IBM/Lenovo used to make them). I am quite confident I could render someone unconscious with it and still be able to continue working using it afterwards.<p>I need to upgrade my old Latitude within this year and I am desperate to find a good candidate, having considered the T420 I now dread the T421.

5399021,comment,5398309,5398896,3,0,AnthonyMouse,,,">as regards the definition of ""cyber threat information"", I'll only say again: this is a narrower, more specific definition of online security threats than in any other piece of online security legislation I've ever read.<p>I don't think the definition is particularly abominable. The issue is that given the level of immunity provided if something is classified as ""cyber threat information,"" there is going to be a huge incentive to shovel the whole wide world into those words, so anything that even resembles breadth is going to be abused. For example, if you should provide ""cyber threat information"" constituting all of the traffic that passes over your network to someone so that they can monitor it for threats of the kind envisioned by the statute (or whatever), there you go. And now they have it and can do what you please with it, not limited to the original purpose.<p>>Regarding the ""protected entities"" and ""individuals"", should this issue come before a court, the court won't have to look far to see the intent of the language, since the House Select Committee on Intelligence published a FAQ that states directly that the intent of that language is to prevent ISPs from sharing information about one of its individual customers.<p>Legislative history generally isn't binding on courts.

For one, you can distribute a patch to people who do not have to do any ""labor"" to get the same effect as the hardware mod.  You can't distribute a hardware mod to others.  Also, with software I feel there is an implicit trust agreement.  Photoshop is just a different series of 1s and 0s than GIMP and both are just a different sequence of 1s and 0s than what exists on the empty, fragmented parts of your hard drive.  However as a society we have agreed to pay for our copy of these binary sequences and this is the entire software market.  We've also, mostly, agreed not to give the software we buy away to everyone else just because it's technologically possible.<p>However I don't think the same social contract exists for hardware.  It might be part of the hacker spirit but hardware modifications are encouraged and often celebrated.  People who make their BMWs drive faster than they should or make Blu Ray lasers into lightsabers are applauded in a much different way than software pirates.

My beef is with organizations who are dishonest about what the bill contains.<p>So, for instance, when it comes to ""intellectual property"" enforcement, an issue brought up directly by the site we're commenting on, IPR protection was removed from the <i>2012</i> CISPA bill before it was voted on. The term ""intellectual property"" occurs in the (incorrect) callout of the bill text on this site.<p>Next, as regards the definition of ""cyber threat information"", I'll only say again: this is a narrower, more specific definition of online security threats than in any other piece of online security legislation I've ever read. The intent of that language seems straightforward to me. And the <i>explicit exemption</i> of consumer terms of service and licensing is unprecedented, which makes it all the more jarring to see the bill compared to SOPA.<p>Regarding the ""protected entities"" and ""individuals"", should this issue come before a court, the court won't have to look far to see the intent of the language, since the House Select Committee on Intelligence published a FAQ that states directly that the intent of that language is <i>to prevent ISPs from sharing information about one of its individual customers</i>.<p>If you want to lay out a comprehensive case against CISPA, or even a few selected valid ones, I'd welcome the input.

On a typical day, I ate 3-4 normal breakfasts throughout the morning (a bagel w/ cream cheese, a smoothie, 2 or 3 eggs and toast, maybe a bowl of oatmeal).  Dinners were typically a massive serving of lasagna or similar pasta.  Lots of snacks throughout the day.  The only days where I would say that I easily got enough calories were when I gave in to the temptation of a fast-food hamburger and milkshake.

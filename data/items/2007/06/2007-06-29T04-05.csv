31538,comment,31523,31523,0,0,Readmore,,,"I think co-founders can both help and hurt you depending on how focused they are. If you are very focused on your startup and working the long hours to make it happen it can be rough when you can't fully depend on your co-founders to get as much done as you expect. It's great to have someone else who believes in your project, especially if they can do things you aren't good at. However, it can create an extra tension when you have to be dependant on someone else getting their work done before you can move on to your next milestone. Just my 2 cents.",1183091749

I think this is a buried lede; free sites aren't just paid sites with lower costs, they have different (and sometimes better) characteristics than their paid counterparts:<p>1.) Easier to signup - no need to force users to drag out their credit cards<p>2.) Enhanced anonymity - no need to tie an account to a real person<p>3.) Simpler operation - the site owner doesn't have to worry that the users are ripping him off/subverting his business model<p>4.) Lower expectations - how much can a user complain if he's getting something for free?

31536,comment,31523,31523,0,0,jmtame,,,"I think it depends on your personality.<p>I really have a difficult time settling on equity, because I have absolutely no faith in ""business"" co-founders.  I really see no purpose until a product is well-developed.  You could probably call this a Mark-Zuckerberg'ism ;)<p>So I have to negotiate the equity with a technical co-founder, but when times come where they don't want to keep up with you, then what?  So it all depends on if you can find a strong co-founder or not.  If you can, I'd say go for it.<p>Otherwise, I don't think it's that bad to develop something solo until you can attract some attention.  I plan on doing that when I get back to school.",1183090821

31533,comment,31523,31523,0,0,fireandfury,,,"An alternate for the question would be: What advantages are there for having a co-founder?<p>Mostly I'd like to read people's opinions and not particularly argue for one side. In my opinion, the right answer depends completely on what type of person you are. Although historically, it seems multiple co-founders are much more prevalent. ",1183090379

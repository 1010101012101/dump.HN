991379,comment,990567,991102,0,0,iigs,,,"I mean it mostly theoretically: In my case I work at a company with a multiple billion dollar market cap, several thousand employees, and I have 4-digits in stock/options (and lately that's been a generous estimate).<p>I was the ~100th employee, so to some extent I feel allegiance, but I'm also salaried well below market rate for my skillset (part of that going to work early for a company thing).<p>Also, regarding per-hour: The salaried people are often the ones ""getting screwed""! I grabbed my work-life balance by the horns, but some of my coworkers were not as fortunate, and they rightly make the argument that if they were paid by the hour they'd be making 50-100% more per year than their salaried rate. One of the sweetest stories I know in this regard is a guy who went from helpdesk to system administration -- he refused to take the official title change so that he could stay salaried. He'd have to take a 30-40% pay cut to switch.<p>As it goes, I'd prefer to have even _more_ fine grained control over my destiny: If I could work 80% as much and make 70-80% of the salary, I'd think long and hard about it. A lot of other people might not want to make that choice. A coworker of mine would rather be on a half-time program with reduced or no benefits (and is brilliant enough to merit the inconvenience to the organization). We can't do that because of the inflexibility of the business world, but collectivism would play directly against that goal.",1260611434

991374,comment,991012,991294,0,0,dan_the_welder,,,"In my experience there are plenty of police that don't even <i>know</i> the law. I used to carry around a copy of the the Florida statues, the same version that the police have in the trunk of their cruisers which they could refer to if they actually gave a shit and did not just want to harass cyclists because they are having a bad day.<p>They make stuff up all the time. It's shameful. Before you get all ""Oh, you must be one of those jerks!"". I would like to say that by not getting pissed off you can spontaneously create a relationship with a law enforcement officer and actually get them on your side.<p>This actually takes a tremendous amount of self control, which we are not capable of at all times, since we are all fallible humans. However in most cases law enforcement works for us, we pay their salaries to protect us (sometimes from ourselves) not to abuse us.<p>The circumstance of being a non-citizen at the border is of course different but in a larger sense is the same. If you anger your neighbor enough times then they will seek a remedy through a higher authority.<p>The solution is using the law. Every time government agents abuse their authority they must be sued, if there is to be law then it must be the tool we all use. If there was abuse of authority in this case then there is a legal remedy to be sought.<p>I don't want to live in a police state. I have some personal responsibility, as does everyone else, in preventing that from happening.",1260610636

However, this requires server-side implementation, so it's not very useful for clients who are trying to protect their own browsing.<p>One option (albeit a performance-degrading one) would be to implement the same quantization in a local proxy.

991356,comment,990523,990523,0,0,yters,,,"I think the real reason we have so much neuroticism in our culture is that we don't believe there is an accessible realm of objective, real value.  We think that everything we find pleasure and meaning in is merely physical, thus doomed to elimination.  However, we yearn for unchanging meaning, and can never find satisfaction in these transient distractions.<p>Seems that instead of focusing on things like therapy and medication, we should try to find an absolute source of meaning that actually satisfies us.  Something like a more reason based approach to dealing with neuroticism, identifying the actual root and trying to find its solution, would be much more effective.  But, I've never heard of such a thing.  Instead, it's all about regulating ourselves and trying to become normal, though since no one is normal there doesn't seem to be such a thing.",1260609137

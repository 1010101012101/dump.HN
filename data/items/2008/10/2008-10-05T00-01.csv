You have photoshop and like it, and apparently don't mind paying for it.  Slamming competing software when it is blindingly obvious that you have no intention of using it is basically just knee-jerk jealousy.",1223168100
323750,comment,323724,323724,0,0,131072,,,"That article is a little garbled. What it seems to be saying is that Apple is going to CNC machine MacBook cases from a solid block instead of stamping (or maybe even hydroforming) them. This seems like an incomplete part of the story, since it would be near-impossible to CNC machine aluminum to the very thin dimensions they currently have with their stamped cases. It would also be very difficult to machine a block with the dimensions of a MacBook so that the innards are hollow, reducing the number of seams and fasteners. A great deal of scrap would be produced in the form of aluminum chips, which do not recycle well because the high surface area means there is a lot of aluminum oxide to deal with.<p>Water jets and laser cutters are in common usage and one or other has probably been used to cut the blanks or trim the finished case parts since the titanium powerbook. They are also excellent for parts like the bezel on the front of the MBP screen. They are not generally used to carve 3D shapes - that is done by a CNC mill, which resembles a big drill bit that can move in three dimensions if you haven't seen one. To stamp a MBP case would take seconds - CNC machining one from solid might keep a 7-figure machine occupied for several minutes. Water jets and lasers generally blow a hole right through whatever they are pointed at, limiting their usage to cutting flat sheets or trimming the edges from stamped parts.<p>If this article is true, I think we are more likely to see more elaborate internal bracing or complex case designs from Apple. The innards of a MBP are fairly prosaic and complex machining could be used to improve airflow and allow components to be packed closer together. Aluminum could also be strategically placed in more complex shapes to help conduct heat out of the case. But when you manufacture parts by the million, casting the parts then finish-machining them may be more efficient, since the need to tie up expensive machines is reduced. Perhaps this is a strategy to get out of the 'just like every other laptop but with OSX' trap and maintain their competitive advantage in 'design' now that their competitors are starting to lift their game.<p>Also, aircraft-grade aluminum doesn't really mean anything. There are many different grades with different purposes, many of which are in common use in all kinds of relatively mundane applications. No doubt the current MacBook Pros are made from 'aircraft grade aluminum', but coke cans probably are too.<p>It sounds like some juicy info has unfortunately been filtered through one or two levels of people who aren't familiar with machine tool jargon. It would be very interesting to hear more details.<p>If you want to play with these machines yourself, check out emachineshop.com - a cool startup if ever there was one.",1223167779

It may seem necessary - but it isn't fair to the boy! You are placing a life handicap in his path if you deprive him of education. In this age, education is becoming more and more essential for success and prestige in all walks of life, including farming.<p>Should you feel that your own education was neg- lected, through no fault of yours, then you naturally will want your children to enjoy the benefits of a real education - to have some things you may have missed.<p>With the help of a Case Kerosene Tractor it is possible for one man to do more work in a given time, than a good man and an industrious boy, together, working with horses. By investing in a Case Tractor and Oxxx Detour Plow and Harrow outfit now, your boy can get his schooling without interruption, and the Spring work will not suffer by his absence.<p>Keep the boy in school - and let a Case Kerosene Tractor take his place in the field. You'll never regret either investment.''",1223165236

I wonder if Fred Gibson (architect and Lisp hacker who hangs out here) would have a comment on this.<p>I like Alexander quite a bit, except for his tendency to intellectual cultishness. The 4-volume set he recently came out with (after 30 years) has a lot of good stuff in it, but it's marred by gobs of insufferable nonsense about being the greatest this-or-that of the last 1600 years. Like most gurus, the man doesn't need an entourage of epigones. What he needs is an editor.<p>Edit: there's another thing that bugs me about Alexander (though I really am a fan). It's that the photos of his actual buildings I've seen don't seem to live up to the genius of the things he says <i>about</i> how to make buildings. That incongruity gives me pause. Of course, one wouldn't expect him to make grand or immodest buildings in any way (that would be even more incongruous). Perhaps one has to experience them in person.",1223165174

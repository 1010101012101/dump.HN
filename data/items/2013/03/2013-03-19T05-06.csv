Plus, the lifespan of a dog is ~7 times shorter than the lifespan of a man, which will give them at least 7 generations more to adapt.<p>Obviously there has been some adaptation to the change of diet, and it is also obvious that this diet was not letal to human (or nobody would have adopt it), but this does not implies that it is optimal for human consumption. Most people in my region are not lactose intolerant... but do you know what? I threw up every time that my mother had me drink a glass of milk because it was ""healthy"" and good for my bones.

Then you can rank them in order I suppose.  It is obviously a ludicrous endeavor on reflection.  It's like the Douglas Adams joke that the answer to life, the universe and everything is 42.  When science actually makes progress on the brain, I'm sure biologists of the future will look on IQ  like we look on phrenology.<p>Thirdly, these social science studies of twins mentioned were done by Thomas J. Bouchard, Jr.  He's someone who writes op-eds for the Wall Street Journal - I guess Nature and Science are too full and his work crowded into there.<p>The second edition of the Mismeasure of Man by Stephen Jay Gould is a good book on this topic.<p>There was a hysterical conservative reaction to Gould's book just as there was a hysterical progressive reaction to the Bell Curve.

I think incorporation is too premature. All you guys have is an idea. Its the product that you build that actually matters. While it's a good idea for you guys to come to a basic agreement as to how you guys will divide equity/responsibilities in the future, it is too premature for any contracts to get signed now. For all you know, a year from know the product/idea/team could have imploded; not incorporating means you guys would not have any paperwork to deal with (nor wasted money).<p>First, build a minimum viable product, then launch it, then see what traction you guys are getting, while iterating. If you guys think you have something, then start a company.<p>2. I am also very concerned because it sounds like you guys also have school to deal with (you seem to have several more years to go), which will make it very difficult for you guys to commit to making your product a success. Postponing college is an option for the 18 year old (taking a few years off), but if the 18 year old takes a leave of absence from college or otherwise postpones college while you still stay in high school, you guys will run into issues where you're contributing less than the other. I honestly think it will be nearly impossible to juggle school and work while also out-competing people who do not have school to worry about. As you can see, there are a whole host of issues you guys need to think through. Or maybe you've skipped a few grades and I don't know it.<p>3. A guy you met on the internet (and have never/barely worked with, and have barely interacted with, and have never met face-to-face, and otherwise don't really know personally) is not a potential co-founder. What if it turns out that he's really flaky/lazy/abrasive/rude/generally bad? He is an unknown quantity. It also complicates things quite extensively because you guys have probably never had to manage someone (club leadership does not count). You are better off hiring him as a contractor for now (and in the process gauge his skills and his communication skills and also in the process improve your own project management skills).<p>If you do go ahead with incorporation:<p>1. Get parents involved (see if your parents know or are friends with any lawyers who are familiar with incorporation or equity issues).<p>I am not intimately familiar with how equity is dealt with for minors, but I would wildly guess that a parent of the 14 year old would have to sign all legal documents for that 14 year old and also hold board seats/other contractually significant positions. However, a trust or custodial account might be able to be set up for the 14 year old. I am not sure about this.",1363672016

Millions of people who are locked out of the ""real"" economy in one way or another start using BTC to buy wireless minutes, or electricity, or nights in capsule motels; whatever fungible commodity the prepaid service provider can get a good deal on. Those BTC are perhaps transferred back into TND, ISK, CHF or some other local currency, or kept as an offshore BTC fund.<p>Connoisseurs of global financial crime will recognize that this is basically a souped up internet speed version of the Peso Exchange that doesn't rely on shipping goods to overseas locations.<p>Now if a player with enough legitimate cover were to run this playbook, they could do it as a branded card and basically own the public perception of prepaid card good for all kinds of things that can get paid for by the internet...<p>Not to say that there aren't issues with this model, and this is not a game one could get into with less than 30 Million USD in liquid assets.

Blame the person for being oversensitive and blowing things out of proportion. Then other defensive reactions ranging from yelling to ostracizing the female from the group follow.

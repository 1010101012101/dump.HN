It was for a <i>segment</i> of the wireless spectrum to be auctioned off with the restriction that it be open to any device that meets certain specifications.  The big-4 wireless carriers can keep their allotted bands; this is a new part of the electromagnetic spectrum that is scheduled to be auctioned off shortly anyway.<p>If the wireless spectrum is OURS (as in, the U.S. peoples'), it makes sense that we can restrict its usage in whatever way would benefit the people most.  It also makes sense that one such way would be to restrict its usage so that the buyer cannot restrict other firms' usage of it.<p>It's essentially an easement.  You know what an easement is, right: the owner of the property sells off certain rights and restrictions to a third-party.  For example, power companies will buy an easement to run high-tension lines over a field.  Wealthy individuals will sell an easement stating that their land will become conservation land after their death, and the owner will be prohibited from developing certain areas.  In this case, the government is giving an easement for open-access to the general public, and selling off the remaining rights to that portion the EM spectrum to the highest bidder.<p>There is no economic reason why this chunk would sell for higher than the existing telecoms' slices.  Its usage rights are restricted: generally, an easement lowers the value of the remaining property rights, since you can do less with it.  Also, if you read the article, you'll notice that it's being <i>auctioned</i> off, which means the government isn't setting a price, it's selling it to the highest bidder, who will presumably be responsible for developing the network and putting up cell towers.<p>Actually, if I had a few billion dollars in funding and a plan for putting up cell towers more cheaply than the established carriers, I'd buy it.  This could be a game-changer on the same order as Intel's invention of the microprocessor.  Before Intel, the minicomputer field was much like the wireless field, with many vertically-integrated carriers stifling innovation.  Because Intel (and Microsoft) decided to focus only on one area and relentlessly lower costs, letting others innovate in the app sphere, the PC market exploded.  We all know how it worked out for Intel and Microsoft...<p>Even if the government doesn't grant this easement, a savvy investor should swoop in and make that portion of the spectrum open-access anyway.  There's potentially a <i>massive</i> market there.  Too bad I don't have a billion dollars...",1181491097

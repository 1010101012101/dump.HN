People don&#x27;t like the unpleasantness and turmoil of disagreeable ideas and people with those ideas, and so the solution is not to burst the comfortable down-pillow bubble of their existence, but to pad it further by &quot;eliminating&quot; &quot;negativity&quot;. Even better considering who gets to decide what constitutes &quot;negativity&quot;. Fantastic job, guys. Bravo.<p>Edit: There are some salient points here about downvoting and how it&#x27;s affected the community, and I am extremely interested in how &quot;to turn more moderation power over to the community&quot; is going to compound the problem of incentivizing positive-only feedback, id est if and how this &quot;community moderation&quot; mechanism will couple with downvoting to make disagreeing even more hazardous.",1428091173

It&#x27;s your proof. You may have written a proof in the paper, but that was just a practice run. It&#x27;s the one you wrote in the code that is the real proof, because there is little garaunteeing that seasoned software developers write code that matches the spec, say nothing about&quot; amateur&quot; programmers in the sciences.<p>Now, that does not preclude innovation. People still invent new mathematical notation systems. It&#x27;s usually with the express purpose of solving problems that can&#x27;t easily or at all be stolved in current systems. It is the bleeding edge of the science of math. But physicists are still expected to use the math their colleagues will understand, or spend a lot of time explaining their new system (QM anyone?).<p>There is, of course, the issue that math is significantly less rigorous and specific than code. Math doesn&#x27;t compile and doesn&#x27;t run. Or rather, it gets compiled and ran by people. Part of avoiding new, arbitrary notations is so that your work is accessible for verification. That gives running code, especially coffee with a comprehensive set of unit tests, a distinct advantage over math. But that doesn&#x27;t obviate the bed for verification.<p>If you are using any nontrivial piece of custom software in your science, it needs to be scrutinized just as much as the rest of the math in your paper--if not more so, since it does the actual work.<p>The first reviewer is almost certainly right. If they can&#x27;t understand your code, then they aren&#x27;t the equivalent of lay-users complaining about open source software. First of all, it is still an issue of much debate whether or not releasing source code to user&#x27;s for software products is necessary. If you are writing code for your science, you have an absolute duty to open source that code (even if in a non-extendable way, we still need to see the code). You wouldn&#x27;t make a claim without providing the math. And you wouldn&#x27;t provide math other people couldn&#x27;t understand, arguing &quot;some math is better than no math&quot;.<p>I don&#x27;t think that standard should be R, or that it necessarily has to always be the same thing. It can adapt over time. But until you manage to release a few papers on how Julia improves over R, in explicit detail... &quot;when in Rome, do as the Romans.&quot;",1428090356

Most of the students have never programmed before, although some have created incredibly complex machinations in Minecraft or other creative building games.
I try to approach the course as not an introduction to programming but as an introduction to the idea that computers can be more than just consumption devices.
There are usually around 6 students in the class (with a much longer wait-list) and invariably there is at least one student who doesn&#x27;t want to write code.

It&#x27;s way too easy to write it off a the driver made a mistake and never have an investigation into the root cause.<p>However we HAVE seen that it&#x27;s possible to hack into a car, there are multiple news articles showing people taking over control of cars remotely and killing the breaks, shutting off the engine, pushing down the accelerator, etc.<p>Also I don&#x27;t buy the &quot;Safety&quot; argument it&#x27;s way to easy to scream &quot;Think of the children&quot; to kill off an argument.

Rust strings are valid unicode, but many filesystems don&#x27;t have such strict requirements[0]. Again Rust returns an Option to makes that evident although there&#x27;s a &quot;to_string_lossy&quot; method which will simply replace invalid sequences with U+FFFD if you don&#x27;t really care<p>The Rust philosophy is generally to expose these issues upfront and force the developer to consider them (and either handle or explicitly ignore them). It is indubitably less convenient than e.g. Python 3&#x27;s `PurePath(app_path).name` returning an str, but you&#x27;ll have had to decide what happens in case of failure.<p>Paths are really a good example of something which looks simple, should be simple, and is actually anything but simple for historical and technical reasons, especially in a cross-platform context.<p>[0]<p>* Unix paths are the most troublesome: they&#x27;re arbitrary bags of (non-NUL) bytes, they don&#x27;t have to be in a known encoding, they don&#x27;t have to be in <i>any</i> encoding.<p>* Windows paths are not guaranteed to be Unicode either: they&#x27;re UTF-16 code units aka UCS2 + surrogates, and the surrogates may be unpaired, leading to invalid Unicode.<p>* OSX paths are guaranteed to be valid Unicode.",1428089329

Of that trade deficit, only 1.5 billion or so is to Germany, which is nothing in a 4 trillion economy. I am not sure whether there will be such a cascading effect from leaving the EU. Sure, if Greece defaults on its debts to other EU states, then those states may need to default on their debt themselves, but the market already knows that there is a big chance that Greece will default on its debts or that they need to be forgiven, and Greece is a small country. Even in the worst case when many of the insolvent states exit the EU, the vast majority of German export will still remain. For sure Germany has more to lose if the EU turns into total chaos scenario, but even if there is a big cascading effect it&#x27;s hard to imagine that, so most of Germany&#x27;s export will remain even in the face of several states leaving the EU. That&#x27;s why I think that the life of the average German will not be impacted nearly as much as the life of the average Greek.<p>You&#x27;re right though that this discussion of who will hurt more is irrelevant.

Quite often you can literally copy templates over into new project.<p>* usage of real promises allows you to use chai async tests without looking back at framework, instead of relying on right timing of firing $apply() (and making sure to not call it twice!)<p>* not relying on dirty-checking, and instead use setters/getters quite often forces you to think and isolate model code from glue.<p>* describing state via html (as it is proposed with ui.router - very popular component) can not be easily migrated at all, since most of frameworks define state in code and/or configs. This is paradigm shift.<p>While I agree, the bigger framework, harder it gets to write portable code, but angular in practice tends to make it even harder in my experience.",1428088030

Will you have death by lethal injection, hanging, or being set on fire? I&#x27;d pick the first. Being an advocate of the &quot;capitalistic welfare state&quot; (as I am) is a similar sort of choice.<p>Why is this? I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s just intellectual cop-out. I think the problem is that economics and all the other complex systems issues that hide behind politics are things that human beings are just not well-equipped to understand. We&#x27;re bad at economics and social planning for the same reason we are bad at understanding the genome holistically. We just can&#x27;t &quot;grok&quot; stuff like that.<p>I sometimes wonder if this isn&#x27;t a neurological barrier. After all, how often in human evolution did we confront the need to understand parallel auto-adaptive systems with tangled webs of causality, multiple positive and negative feedback loops, and chaotic behavior? This may require neurological hardware that we just don&#x27;t have, so we try to muddle through by applying linear reductionism. It doesn&#x27;t work very well, but it&#x27;s the only cognitive tool we have for decomposing a system that remotely works at all.<p>The free-ish market with a welfare state is a mess of hacks we&#x27;ve come up with through historical experimentation that seems to offer the benefits of certain classes of systems while mitigating their downsides.

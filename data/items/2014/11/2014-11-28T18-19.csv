8671803,comment,8671420,8671420,0,0,jandrewrogers,,,"There is an important reason that Apple rarely acquires products even if they have difficulty producing a similar product themselves: design continuity.<p>Apple places an enormous amount of value on this, often more than having the best possible product at the moment. A mature, wildly popular non-Apple product has its own institutional design continuity. This impedance mismatch can be dealt with in one of two ways, either by letting the discontinuity stay in the product mix, which leads to fragmented user experience across product lines, or to break the design continuity of the acquired product, which alienates the users that made the product so valuable in the first place.<p>A company like Tesla may have a strong focus on good design and design continuity just like Apple but by blending those two companies you create an obvious design <i>dis</i>-continuity in the joined organization which goes against their nature.<p>If you were not going to blend the companies, like the article suggests, what would be the purpose then? To create an investment company that has a portfolio of design focused companies that never interact with each other? That is not their business domain. And by Apple returning cash to investors, they are allowing investors to do exactly that. I can take my Apple dividend check and buy Tesla stock if I want to.<p>I think Tim Cook has shown surprising discipline with the cash stockpile Apple has. Apple knows exactly who they are and is not trying to be something outside of that.",1417201106

It&#x27;s a band-aid for sure but it&#x27;s better than this, no?<p>Also I see the minimum wage as harmful in this situation - you can tell yourself and the world that an hours worth of human time is <i>always</i> worth at least x USD, but it will never make it true.  Policymakers do not set minimum wages with someone struggling to get off the streets in mind, but rather with someone in an altogether much less dire situation, and in doing so they raise the barrier too high.

Why buy a car company?<p>Twitter is actually similar- yes, it&#x27;s a tech company, but it&#x27;s not a company that makes a product and sells it, it&#x27;s an online advertising play.  This is, again, not Apple&#x27;s business model.  Same thing with Pinterist.<p>Buying Beats gives apple two products that fit its business model:  The headphones are hardware that is sold at a nice markup.  The audio services is a value add that increases the value of the hardware Apple already sells.<p>I don&#x27;t see Pinterest or Twitter increasing the value of the iPhone over where it is now (with Twitter and Pinterest already integrated to iOS).<p>So, what could Apple buy that fits its business model and adds value to the company?<p>I think the producers of key ARM IP, and ASICs would be good choices.  I think Apple&#x27;s at a point where it might make sense to, rather than paying Samsung a premium, control its own fab.  So, I&#x27;d look at buying TSMC, or even Intel. (though not sure Intel is cheap enough yet.)  Less radically, I&#x27;d buy Imagination (The people who make the GPU cores Apple uses) and, in fact, if it were me, I&#x27;d buy ARM itself.

8671777,comment,8670312,8670312,0,0,jfarmer,,,"The author of the article buried the lede, which is in the last paragraph:<p>> <i>So the tension around types comes from the fact that if you want to program in a style that turns effects into explicit things that get passed around, sophisticated higher-order functions are necessary to keep your code reasonably clean. And sophisticated higher-order functions tend to have fancy complicated types. To make programming with them palatable, you either need to have a correspondingly fancy type system or punt on types entirely.</i><p>I think the author is right when he says &quot;To explain the why of monads, we have to first explain the why of the functional style of programming.&quot;  However, he says one of the &quot;defining characteristics&quot; of the functional style is that &quot;[f]ancy type systems are important.&quot;  The net effect of the article is to give the impression that monads exist because one needs a &quot;fancy type system&quot; to program with pure functions â as if it were the &quot;fanciness&quot; that mattered.<p>We don&#x27;t have to look hard to understand the &quot;why&quot; of monads.  They were introduced in the paper <i>Monads for Functional Programming</i> by Philip Wadler (<a href=""http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/papers/marktoberdorf/baastad.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/papers/marktoberdorf/ba...</a>) and he spells out the motivations very clearly!<p>Here was one key to my understanding monads. In a purely functional language you want everything to be referentially transparent.  That is, every expression should be able to be substituted for its value no matter where it appears.  At the very least, you&#x27;ll want the ability to denote which parts of your program are referentially transparent and which aren&#x27;t.<p>This can be expressed as utopian vision: in a purely functional language we&#x27;d like everything â <i>everything</i> â to be a value.  And if you want expressions involving functions to be referentially transparent you&#x27;re going to need pure functions.<p>We now need some way of translating code with side effects into code that returns a value. One reasonable abstraction is to say that the &quot;value&quot; is not the work itself â once the work is done it&#x27;s out of the bag, after all â but rather the &quot;value&quot; is the machine which can perform that work.",1417200717

Couldn&#x27;t attacker X just mimic a fake browser window, simulate a bank&#x27;s login screen (address bar et al), and steal login info? Phishing does the exact same thing, but the URL is always cunningly disguised as the real URL. For example: http://bankofamerica.com.87654321.com/login.do. With an exact replica of the Operating System, as-well, as a browser mockup, it can be quite possible to mimic the real URL, so all the user sees is http://bankofamerica.com/login.do. 

    When fullscreen got launched, obviously the Mozilla team did their homework. Firstly, the user knows very well they&#x27;re entering fullscreen mode (via a very well placed message). As-well as this, the user always has to &quot;click&quot;, or otherwise activate Fullscreen through a button. Click-jacking, however is out of the question with Fullscreen. (I&#x27;ve tried it). You can&#x27;t fire-up Fullscreen by emulating a click. So with this in mind, Chromeless Windows should adapt the same pattern.</code></pre>",1417200510

On that exchange, market capitalization is measured and is a proxy for everything going on with public companies. What you are talking about in 1) and 2) is some non-existent market on which total equity and debt with vastly different characteristics is valued on one shot. What exchange do you have in mind here? The only time you fully measure all the effects to calculate the enterprise value is when you are buying the company outright. There are several practical reasons why you donât measure and trade on the enterprise value of the listed companies. To list a few<p>1.On the equity side you only know the prices of outstanding shares, how will you value the non-traded shares and options? There is no simple measure to assign the control premium on a single company much less the entire stock market. This doesnât include debt that might convert to equity on different schedules.<p>2.On the debt side, debt can be convertible to equity, have different seniority, payment schedule, liquidity and risk profiles. What does a consolidated number tell you? Not to mention off-balance sheet commitments and the fact that debt for some sectors like a financial company might not make any sense. What does the enterprise value of Bank of America even mean?<p>3.Even valuing cash has problems if you are like a US tech company with billions abroad that might be subject to myriad tax rules.<p>Finally with 3) you talked about private companies, at that point you probably need to look at SOE in China as well.

They went after Samsung, convinced them through some kind of deal to pay up (which may have even been in <i>Samsung&#x27;s favor</i> - think Windows discounts or whatever) and then showed all the other companies &quot;look who we got to pay up for <i>infringing on our patents</i>. If big ol&#x27; Samsung paid up - do you really want to risk taking you to Court?&quot; It was a classic patent troll move.<p>But people (including Congress,etc) tend to give them a break because they not an NPE, and are also a &quot;big tech company&quot; that &quot;invents stuff&quot;, regardless of whether these patents from which they make billions a year by harassing Android OEMs using <i>open source software</i> are <i>COMPLETE SHIT</i>. They were so useless, Microsoft agreed to <i>pay B&N</i>  $300 million to stop the lawsuit and settle with them, because they were about to invalidate some of their most &quot;valuable&quot; patents they were using to threaten others.<p>It was the same with Apple&#x27;s patent war. Apple has lost most of the lawsuits it started throughout the world, because the  <i>the patents it was using to scare others into paying them were crap</i>. But people gave them the benefit of the doubt because they are &quot;an innovative company&quot; or something, so using crap patents to rent-seek or ban other competitors&#x27; products from the market must be ok then.<p>My point is the patents should be judged at face value, whether they are valuable or crap. It shouldn&#x27;t matter if it&#x27;s a big company using them or even an NPE (which could actually be a university that just researches technology). The value of the patent should matter much more than who&#x27;s owning it.<p>This is also why I don&#x27;t buy the whole &quot;new Microsoft&quot; PR facelift thing.

Some of the abstractions haskellers use are significantly more abstract than what you typically see in mainstream languages.  Sure, it will be more difficult for a newcomer to comprehend.

Otherwise they&#x27;ll just ignore you.<p>Here, for example, you&#x27;ll note the pitch is that it&#x27;s easy to improve one&#x27;s brain, of great appeal to nerds. And it&#x27;s backed up with high-tech science, a great draw to we technical people.<p>As a long-time meditator, I could happily talk about how it has improved my ability to make software. Deep awareness of my sensations and subtle reactions has made me very good at understanding exactly what parts of user interfaces work and what don&#x27;t. The increased patience and focus is great for dealing with complex software. The greater self-awareness has helped me avoid things like gold-plating and architecture astronautics because I&#x27;m better at sorting out my motivations. I&#x27;m way better at noticing when I&#x27;m really too tired to be coding, so I create a lot fewer bugs. Et cetera, et cetera. If somebody starts because of that, great.<p>But knowing a lot of other meditators, I think the reason people start is relatively unimportant. As with almost anything deep (e.g., fitness, science, math), serious study and practice change you more deeply than you intend. More deeply than you can even understand when you start. For example, many people take martial arts classes because they crave the power to beat people up. But we don&#x27;t have a problem with karate students roving in packs and attacking people because long study teaches them self-control, teaches them the limits of violence, the proper use of power. Similarly, even if people start meditating in pursuit of self-enhancement, they can&#x27;t help but be changed more deeply.<p>We start with people where they are.",1417197648

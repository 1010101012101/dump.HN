The headings are self-explanatory<p>2-sign up for a free account should be slightly distinguished from other screen shots<p>3-it would be nice if the user is taken straight to home page rather than selecting the package first<p>4-rather than medium sized screen-shots, it would be great if you can add a demo",1220273284

Only something did happen -  <i>post comment</i> button is below the fold, but the login/register layer appears above the fold. I found it after clicked 5 or 6 times, giving in, and scrolling up to hit the site id for home.<p>This is in webkit, btw.",1220273177

Why not shift to gradual engagement - let me play with the app, enter a few invoices, add a few clients etc. and then when I want to save my work have me sign up & make an informed choice about package.",1220272446

Something pops up and they have to figure out what it is. Now you can make the user read the message, or you can make the window scannable by sticking actions on button labels. Reading the buttons is much faster than reading the sentence above. Sure, you're gonna save like 2 seconds of the user's time, but these 2 seconds are going to be multiplied by thousands in the course of the user using the app or OS. Little touches like this help make a good product.",1220271337

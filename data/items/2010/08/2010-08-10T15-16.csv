It's also a difficult one to answer but I'll try.<p>More than a few people should pass because that's what the Board of Regents, the college president, the Governor, the Legislature, and society at large want and they pay my salary.  This isn't a flippant statement.  In my state one of the Board of Regents wants my pay to be dependent upon how many people pass my class.  Every year the president of the college sends a report to the Department of Mathematics and asks what we are doing to improve the passing rate.<p>The state wants three things,<p>1. we must accept anyone who applies
2. we should pass almost everyone who takes our classes
3. everyone who passes should 'know' the material<p>You can have any two of these things but not all three.  I have a lot of pressure from the administration and so my perception of what skills it takes to pass has been a decreasing function for the past 10 years.<p>Almost all of my colleagues give point based on things that a well trained chimp can do.  They give points for attendance.  They give points for turning in homework.  (The homework doesn't have to be correct to get the points.)  My colleagues try their hardest to give students enough points so that they can reach the magical 70% thresh hold.  Some have lowered this magical thresh hold to 60%.<p>What it means to pass a class is a level of achievement that most people in the class can reasonably achieve.  It has nothing to do with knowledge, skills, or anything that really matters in terms of learning.  Will 70% of the students pass with this grading scheme, with these assignments, with this level of work and effort?  If the answer is yes then you've got a good idea of what it means to pass a class.<p>This has bad, long term consequences for society writ large.  I'm aware of this and I try the best I can to reach as many students as possible.<p>I definitely don't teach my students as if I was in the audience.

If we moved healthcare and other benefits onto the employee, you'd be paying that money as extra salary, or else they're getting effectively less compensation.  If we went with a libertarian model, you'd just be paying higher wages so that your employees could buy their current stuff and also hire their own police and fire companies (and you'd need to pay for your business's protection).<p>That's not to say you couldn't trim some fat with other methods, but the only real ways to eliminate paying that 33% involve cutting your employees' standards of living.

1591745,comment,1590713,1590713,0,0,elasticdog,,,"I'd advise putting your vim directory (or ALL of your dotfiles) under version control. To keep things clean, the first thing you should do is install Tim Pope's pathogen plugin which allows you to install each plugin in its own self-contained directory under ~/.vim/bundle/plugin-name/, and it will autoload everything for you.<p><pre><code>  $ cd ~/.vim/
  $ git init
  $ mkdir {autoload,bundle}
  $ wget -O autoload/pathogen.vim http://www.vim.org/scripts/download_script.php?src_id=12116
  $ git add autoload/pathogen.vim
  $ git commit -m 'add pathogen.vim plugin'
  </code></pre>
Then, you can just extract each plugin under that bundle directory, or if they're managed by the same version control software you're using, you can use something like git submodules to track the plugins automatically. Add this to the top of your ~/.vimrc file:<p><pre><code>  filetype off
  call pathogen#runtime_append_all_bundles()
  filetype plugin indent on</code></pre>
...and you're off to the races. Let's say you want to add NERD_tree:<p><pre><code>  $ git submodule add http://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree.git bundle/nerdtree
  $ git submodule init
  $ git commit -m 'add nerd tree plugin as submodule'
</code></pre>
From then on, you'll be able to track upstream changes to the plugin, and everything is self-contained so you don't have to worry about copying all the files into /doc, /ftplugin, /syntax, etc. The one thing you'll want to do is generate all of the help docs after you have your plugins installed by loading up vim and running:<p><pre><code>  :call pathogen#helptags()
</code></pre>
The list of what I use goes a little something like this:<p>@ pathogen - to cleanly organize all of your plugins<p>@ bufexplorer - to explore your open buffers<p>@ command-t - a better fuzzy finder for opening files<p>@ endwise - add proper end statements for ruby code<p>@ fugitive - fantastic git wrapper<p>@ matchit - jump to matching brackets or logical statements<p>@ nerdtree - navigate and manipulate files<p>@ pastie - post code to pastie.org<p>@ repeat - adds the ability to repeat functions with .<p>@ speeddating - Ctrl-A/Ctrl-X manipulate dates properly<p>@ surround - alter stuff that surrounds text like quotes and html tags<p>@ taglist - helpful source code browser<p>Beyond that, I have a bunch of syntax files for various languages and file formats.<p>Realistically though, if you're just starting out. Learn how to use the editor first, then if you notice certain use cases that you don't have with built-in features (and there are a TON), then start looking for plugins to make your life easier. There's a lot you can do with custom settings and functions in your ~/.vimrc file too, so it will take time (years) to build up what works best for you. Be patient, it's worth it!<p>If you're curious, you can always find gems by looking through other people's configs: <a href=""http://github.com/elasticdog/dotfiles"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/elasticdog/dotfiles</a>",1281453689

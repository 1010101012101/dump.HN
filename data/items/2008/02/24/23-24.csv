122771,comment,122106,122510,0,0,npk,,,"How can one do relevant science without the support that comes from a research institution?  Research professor (I clump lab researchers into the professor term) is certainly a new thing.  So is ""big money"" science (a consequence of WWII.)  As a result of the research prof and ""big money"" science, the days of ben franklin and his kite are long dead. (ben franklin was a great scientist.)<p>Academia is setup to provide support for scientists: it provides smart people to talk to.  It provides money to pay the bills and run research labs.  Where else can I receive this support?<p>One path is to take a 6 year detour, build a startup that pays me $30M, and then run my own research program.  Honestly, that seems even harder than two postdocs.",1203897473

While PI's can't always fire you gracefully, they have many ways to make you <i>wish</i> they had fired you.<p>So, ultimately, if your startup-company moonlighting starts to eat too much into graduate research time, you're going to have to fish or cut bait: Either keep your adviser happy, or take the necessary leave of absence.<p>Note that (most) graduate advisers are not evil people. I suspect that many of them will quite happily grant you six months off to pursue your startup-company dreams... <i>if</i> the timing is right (hint: don't ask until just <i>after</i> the <i>Nature</i> article is submitted) and after they explain to you that your publication record and your graduation time will be set back by a year or more. Oh, and you probably won't be given the plum projects ever again, since your adviser knows that you have one eye on the door... those are the breaks of the game.<p>One very special caution: Your adviser may try to enlist your help in <i>his</i> startup company. <i>Be very wary of this situation,</i> or of any potential adviser with a history of this. You want your adviser to be unambiguously focused on helping you graduate and get a better-paying job... or as unambiguously as possible, anyway.",1203897280

It doesn't even work that well for filtering out teenagers any more with the advent of prepaid gift cards (and before that they could just ask the 'rents to stump up the cash anyway).<p>I say that paid barriers don't do that much good or bad themselves based on the fact that on MeFi they seem to have been an asset whereas on, say, Something Awful they seem to've just turned the place into an echo chamber, and on Kuro5hin all it's done is drive the site further into stagnation.

But there are a number of success stories.<p>Perfect example: the search for extra solar planets.  Twenty years ago, Geoff Marcy, a prof at a teaching school, SF state, begged for telescope time.  Now he's a prof at UC Berkeley, and (I think) PI of a roughly trillion-dollar space mission.<p>Marcy is a multiple-sigma deviation.  His success is rare.  Careers in academic science have a very poor risk-adjusted payoff, worst than startups.  Would I rather be the guy who pioneered planet finding or one of the google guys?  Don't know. :)",1203896376

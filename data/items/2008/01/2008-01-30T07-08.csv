I wouldn't go into companynamesucks.com and the like though - there's no end to the number of such domains that people can come up with if they really want to hurt you. A better use of your time and money would be to make sure you don't give customers a reason to say you suck...",1201678631

I generally prefer medium-long names. Scheme's call-with-current-continuation is too long. Arc's ccc is too short. Ruby's callcc is just right.",1201677516

The better you get, the more specialized your skillset has to become to continue winning, and the less applicable it becomes to other things.<p>Regardless, I think there's something to be said for competing at a high level. It provides more than just entertainment, as some skills <i>do</i> translate if you let them: The confidence you gain by knowing you have what it takes to be among the best at something. An attitude that refuses to settle for less. And a deep appreciation for what hard work and deliberate practice can accomplish.",1337579983

4001478,comment,4001169,4001169,2,0,throwaway_87,,,"I was enjoying the Facebook dissenter's comment until I reached the last word.  It sort of defeated whatever persuasive import he had gained up to that point.<p>What's interesting is the blogger feels the need to engage such a comment.  And he's certainly not the only one.  If it's not a fad, if the quoted comment is way off the mark, if Facebook is all the great things we are told it is, then why is he arguing against a comment like this?  No need to argue with fools, right?<p>But is anyone really sure what the heck Facebook is?  It's a web developer's wet dream is what it is.  Beyond that, who knows?<p>The arguments will continue, as they should.  The jury is still out, though some investors have already reaped hundreds of millions from curious advertisers while we're deciding.  They'll have cashed out long before we come to a final decision.<p>My personal opinion is that human communication through the internet, including photos and video, and achieving global internet connectedness of everyone, not just nerds, is definitely not a fad.  Nor is is it something new.  We've all been working toward this for many years.  But doing it all, even the most personal parts, through Mark Zuckerberg's website?  As in the ""I think I will fuck them in the ear"" Mark Zuckerberg.  I'm just not sure I can call this a practice that is going to continue indefinitely, as other alternatives arise.  There are better ways to do this sort of internet-enabled sharing and commmunication.  To think they will never be made as user-friendly as Facebook seems to be ignoring inevitable forward progress.<p>Historically, Facebook may stand as the first proof we had that we could all coordinate with our friends to exchange contact information and photos in one central repository.  Now that we have everyone's email address, it will be easy to coordinate and move the party elsewhere when the right alternative appears.",1337579439

Perhaps many users are in for a rude awakening after they have been given enough time to evaluate their lives and relationships pre/post Facebook.

The ability to reach the masses quickly, especially with the help of friends, is godsend. As a user I have good and bad days.

4001445,comment,4001099,4001099,23,0,robomartin,,,"A general comment about playing Chess.  I've been playing since I was a kid.  I like the game.  Well, sort of.  I've probably logged nearly 10K games on the playchess server.  One day, while having a conversation about Chess with another (older) engineer he made a comment that really stuck in my mind, he said:  ""All you accomplish by playing a lot of Chess is to become a better Chess player"".<p>His comment had a point to it.  The conversation took place while we were waiting for the results of FEA for a fluid-based thermal management system.  Each run took 18 hours.  It had been running overnight and we were about to get results.  While we waited I fired-up a quick game of Chess and we started to talk about the subject once I was done.<p>His point was that, unless your goal is to become a world champion and somehow earn a living out of playing Chess the game can very easily become a huge waste of time.  You don't learn anything more than playing Chess.  It is false to assume that good Chess players are really smart people.  Yes, they might have the ability to achieve deep concentration and focus on the game.  One would be surprised to learn just how bad some really good Chess players are about other things in life.<p>I thought about this on-and-off for months.  Nearly every time I thought about playing Chess his words played back in my head.  My conclusion was to accept that he was right:  There was no point to playing Chess beyond a level of entertainment.<p>In order to become truly competitive in Chess you have to become a human database.  You need to study openings, endings, all sorts of mid-game permutations.  You need to study your opponents' games and know how to counter some of their moves or approaches.  In other words, you need to turn a fun game into a job.  That, to me, turns a fun game into an ugly job.  I have no interest in being that person.<p>This point got driven home as I taught my kids to play.  I started one of them off when he was six.  This was prior to my ""revelation"".  Very soon he was winning local tournaments right and left.<p>As I understood what was happening I pulled him back a bit from this rather serious engagement with the game.  To some extent he had already learned a lot of what the game has to offer: Considering your options; Patience; Planning; Concentration; Goals; Making choices; etc.  His time would be far better invested on such topics as programming, music, even building cool things with Legos.<p>You can learn the basic real-world-usable lessons of Chess within six to twelve months of playing the game.  Anything beyond that is just playing more Chess with no further lessons that apply to other aspects of your life.<p>I admire GM's at the levels seen in these championships.  Good for them. It is their chosen profession and they excel at it.  However, I am no-longer in awe of their mental abilities.  What they have to become in order to play at these levels is, to me, the absolute opposite of what the game felt like when I was a kid.  It was very cool to solve problems as they were presented and ""fight the battle"".  It isn't cool to play against a database --or have to become one.",1337578650
4001444,comment,4000720,4000720,8,0,pdonis,,,"One thing that struck me as odd was that the author apparently is not an experienced programmer, but she tried to learn Python from the tutorials designed for experienced programmers; she saw that there was a list of tutorials for non-programmers, but she ""didn't look at any of those"". Why not?<p>One possible answer is that the term ""programming"" means something somewhat different to the author than it does to, for example, me. When I look at the Python tutorial topics, even those for non-programmers, I see stuff that looks like programming: loops, conditionals, generators, etc. But the author apparently saw a lot of stuff that didn't seem to have much to do with what she was interested in: getting the computer to do something cool. Processing apparently gave her an easier way to do that.<p>To me, getting the computer to do something cool, in and of itself, is not necessarily ""programming"". For example, the beginner's tutorial for Processing that the author links to tells you to type the following into the editor: ""ellipse(50, 50, 80, 80);"". This, of course, draws an ellipse. Cool! But this, to me, isn't ""programming""; it's just invoking a magic incantation to get the computer to draw an ellipse. ""Programming"" is what the person did who wrote the code that interprets that line you typed and figures out what to draw and where.<p>It's quite possible that this is just me; maybe most people are OK with using the word ""programming"" to describe something that doesn't seem like programming to me. But word choice aside, I am <i>not</i> trying to say that only what I call ""programming"" is worth doing. I think the point is more that maybe ""programming"" is too narrow a term to describe what many people are trying to do when they want to get the computer to do something cool.",1337578598

Most die in the third world. The remainder come from low socioeconomic backgrounds. Cuts that to about 100. Of those 100, few are located in places like Silicon Valley. Now you are around 10.

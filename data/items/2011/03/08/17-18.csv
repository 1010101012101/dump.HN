A lot of high scalable apps could benefit form this.<p>Imagine twitter serving timelines directly from Redis caches to users.<p>But it is mcuh more in the ""computational"" side than ""storage"" side IMHO.

Momentum is a moving target. I'd be blown away if there was another source control tool in history who's userbase has grown as quickly as gits has in the last few years. As for important, I don't really think any of my tools are 'important'. They just let me get important shit done.<p>Also, I don't even know what ""Git's UI"" is, but I'm sure you're right about it sucking. I do take for granted my level of comfort using CLI for source control.<p>I'd be curious about the details of your data loss bug. Most git data loss is user error (though I'll admit the ridiculously obtuse commands and concepts make these very easy to accomplish when learning the tool)",1299607165

I like the simplicity but the UI does leave much to be desired.  Needs a little polish to take it away from the standard output from Rails (aka looks too Railsy, if such terminology usage exists).  I'd try picking one market segment initially to design towards (one underserved by the current event app market) and go more in that direction to establish a beachhead.<p>Homepage, consider an easier to read font.  The background color of the center content area doesn't match the white background.  Make the facebook like way more prominent!   Make the support/feedback also more prominent!  Perhaps don't show the app quite yet, but illustrate the steps to convey the message more clearly than a block of text.<p>Consider teasing functionality and increasing investment of users time by creating the first panel of the event before getting hit with the reg page.<p>Consider making the reg a modal window.<p>At login/reg screens, until mass audience is registered, make it smaller component to the right.<p>The password match can be ajaxed without the page reload needing to take effect.<p>Consider date entry as a calendar control<p>Consider adding end date to the date options.  Duration won't be needed if end date is there.  I would actually use this tool for proposing dates for our annual weekend trips.  But no end date makes that very difficult.<p>Invite entry screen is too cumbersome for the lazy (like me) to use.  Consider integration with Gmail or Fb.<p>A word on the logo is to take it out of that box, leave it on the background and make the stroke around the words thicker and white.  Try to soften the entire interface up so that less harsh box structures exist.  There is great opportunities to do something fun and interesting with the center -- so try it out.",1299607125

2301831,comment,2300836,2301315,0,0,lukeschlather,,,"Everyone's being a little cagey about what Turing Completeness really means, in layman's terms, because I think the assumption is that if you're here, you should already have a deep understanding of it.<p>So no, as others have said, you are completely off base as to what the significance of being Turing complete is. What Turing complete means is that given an infinite amount of memory and time, a language can simulate anything that is computable. (I won't get into what computable means, for that you will need to read and reread the relevant Wikipedia articles, along with a good book on Theory of Computation and probably a good one on Abstract Algebra.)<p>But the real significance of this is that you cannot write a program that can tell you meaningful facts about the behavior of an arbitrary Turing machine. For any program you write to determine the behavior of HTML + CSS, I could write a piece of HTML + CSS that your program will be unable to say anything about.<p>However, this particular proof actually only shows HTML + CSS is equivalent to a Linear Bounded Automaton, which unlike a Turing Machine can be predicted. And strictly speaking, even if you have a Turing-machine-equivalent language like C++, you can theoretically make some predictions about programs provided you can bound its memory, i.e., on a machine with less than 4 GB of memory, it is equivalent to a Linear Bounded Automaton. Now, of course actually writing a second program to do this may be impossible to do before the heat death of the universe, because Linear Bounded Automatons are still very powerful computing objects.",1299606966

The kernel is not being effectively audited, and as a result OSes such as Android end up being shipped with kernel bugs. What this means is that any app you run can bounce out into kernel space through one of these vulnerabilities and back into root userland to take over your phone (incidentally kernel bugs no doubt exist on iOS too, but we're talking about Linux here).<p>In 2009 there were 110 Linux kernel vulns released. Think about it - that's an average of about two a week. This is your phone, your TV, your in-car entertainment system.<p>Finding these bugs isn't hard. Go and download the source tree and search through for strcpy, then trace it back to the function and see where it's used. Then try the same for kfree, kmalloc and vmalloc.<p>You don't even have to download the code for this.

Recursive 3-way merges are much much better at resolving conflicts.  Finally, SVN has some issues with merging a branch multiple times.

I've used it for years (by choice, and I'm a GitHub user), but have never been a power user.<p>I'm annoyed at how the very most basic workflows in Git seem awkward, like I'm working against the tool instead of with it.  The simplest example is: I have a hacked-up tree, but I know changes have been made upstream, and I want to pull those changes:<p>$ git pull\nUpdating 73f91c3..0ee9fa8\nerror: Entry 'README' not uptodate. Cannot merge.<p>It's complaining because I've modified README locally, which was also modified remotely.  Every other reasonable version control system I've ever used will happily merge the upstream changes with my not-yet-committed local changes.  But Git refuses.  This is annoying.<p>What I have to do now is commit my hacked-up, non-compiling, possibly-swear-word-containing in-progress changes.  I really dislike this.  To me, ""commit"" means ""take a finished bit of work and add it to the global history.""  I <i>really</i> dislike having to commit something that is extremely unfinished just because I wanted to integrate some upstream changes.<p>So what I usually do in this situation is ""git stash"", ""git pull"", ""git stash apply.""  This works ok for the ""pull"" case.  But what if I have multiple sets of locally-hacked-up changes?  Like suppose I was working on one change when I realized that there's something else I should really fix first.  ""git stash"" quickly becomes limiting, since you can't name the individual changes, so you get this list of changes that you don't know what they are or what branch/commit they were based on.  In other VCS's like Perforce, you can have multiple sets of independent changes in your working tree.  Not possible with Git AFAIK.<p>Anyway, I'll probably keep using Git, but I'm not as enamored with it as I once was.  I used to figure this was all just porcelain issues that would be refined over time, but it doesn't seem to be getting any better.",1299605865

Look around your house or office and consider how many devices like TVs, dvd players, DVRs, broadband routers, access control devices, industrial control systems and the like run linux and have a usb port. Many of these will have a broad range of usb device drivers built into the kernel (even if they're not used) and often use a network port or wireless chip by design. Very few of these will have reasonable update policies, and even fewer of them will move to a new kernel or backport a vulnerable driver. Many rely on custom drivers that would need to be tested all over again to qualify a new kernel and have busy and relatively inexperienced staff on them.<p>The ability to use these devices as sniffers, network backdoors and MITM attackers is very much there. Most of the time devices like this are more less invisible, very few consumers will be watching their network traffic.

We do have a list of ""if this breaks, contact this guy.""  What we don't have (in response to your first point) is a demand that those people be available Sunday night.<p>3. We have a known rollback procedure.  It does not work if we do a irreversible schema change <i>and</i> the problem's not caught until 20 hours later.  We couldn't just throw out 20 hours of data.<p>4. We actually do a lot of testing.  Beginning on Wednesday, we deploy to our early leak accounts.  We steadily increase that through the week.  The problem with this particular bug is that you could use Kiln lightly (most of our test accounts are not large accounts) without hitting this problem at all.  Even the full QA test suite did not trigger the problem.  That happened because Kiln was designed to keep working in the case of a FogBugz communication failure until it couldn't, which was directly proportional to how much you used Kiln.  The real problem here, which has been fixed, is that Kiln should <i>not</i> attempt to hide a problem communicating with FogBugz.<p>5. We don't do release in the middle of the day.  We do them at 10 PM.  I have no idea where you got that.<p>There's a lot we can improve.  We need to make sure Kiln not talking to FogBugz, which can bring down Kiln, hard-fails, instead of trying to continue.  We need to make sure that all hands are on-deck when people are going to work, as you noted, which is vastly easier to do midweek than Sunday night.  And we probably ought to add more automated testing to the integration points.  But I think you're painting a somewhat unfair picture of the current situation.",1299604463

This is a questionnaire with key questions (i.e. ""What's the goal of your project?"") that we've put together.<p>3) We quickly review the project and send the prospect an estimate of how much it will cost to develop and an estimated timeline. We make sure to make the prospect know the quote and timeline is based on the ideal that it doesn't includes revisions. Something like: Each revision will extend the delivery date by XX days.<p>5) If the prospect accepts we send them a contract and ask for a 50% payment before we do any work. If they are not comfortable with that, or the project is too big, we ask for 25% and then setup several payment deadlines as the project moves forward.<p>6) After the retainer has been paid, we send the (now) client a new questionnaire, called ""Client Worksheet"". Here we get specific to get to know the client better.<p>6) Once we receive payment, we make some research on the project and provide some wireframes along with simple explanations on how we think the goal can be achieved.<p>7) After the client is happy with the final wireframe and signs it off, we proceed to design the mockups. We already know what he likes so usually a couple of revisions is good enough to get final approval.<p>8) Once the design has been approved we start coding. Most of the ""how will it work"" has been already discussed through the wireframes, so it's pretty easy at this point.<p>9) Testing, final payment and launch :-)<p>Hope this helps!",1299604191

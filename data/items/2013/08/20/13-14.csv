Just the fear of the knowledge that one is being comprehensively watched, and what &quot;they&quot; might have. This fear is enough to alter behavior, to conform.<p>Again, at what stage can we describe the US and UK, and their co-conspirators as fascist, police state, oppressive, and so on?<p>Or, do we have micro targeted oppression?

There&#x27;s a free 2008ish audio podcast series of lectures about their history.<p>You could consider that Mosaddegh was doomed to fall, given that, the only question is who gets his job, and Pahlavi, at least initially, looked &quot;better&quot; than the previous Qajar Turks or any of the other competitors, we knew that at least some of the Qajar in the past were completely nuts, whereas Pahlavi didn&#x27;t start going nuts until later.  Perhaps he literally developed a severe mental illness in the 60s as some suspect, which would explain a lot about his behavior.  Anyway, its one of those monday morning quarterbacking things where in retrospect everyone involved might have done better going back to the Qajar dynasty, but of course predictions are difficult, especially about the future.  Currently, looking back to 1970, he looked like an epic disaster in 1970, insert lots of whining about decisions made in 1950, but in 1950 he didn&#x27;t look so bad.<p>One big problem with talking Iranian politics is all of it resonates to present day fights, so the only people talking about it almost by definition have an economic or religious or nationalistic axe to grind, so discerning the truth (if any) is kind of hard when almost no one says anything but PR.  Its a political confuseopoly.  Whats better, coke or pepsi, well, good luck figuring that out from TV commercials and astroturfing.<p>My opinion based on some study, it seems Iran is relatively cursed with poor leaders on average.  I&#x27;m talking about centuries not last month timescale.  Once in awhile they&#x27;ll have a (poor) leader who resonates (at least superficially, temporarily) with some western-ish values, or once in a while they&#x27;ll have a (poor) leader who anti-resonates with us when they nationalize their oil wells, etc, but the common theme seems to be be relatively poor at government leading to turmoil and general misery of everyone involved.  Which is probably how they ended up ruled by Turks for so long, and other imperialist issues.<p>Its a pity, aside from the politics and the extremists 99% of the country and people are pretty cool with a nice enough culture and interesting history.

6243581,comment,6242569,6243416,3,0,FedRegister,,,"The main point I was trying to make is that, if you don&#x27;t own a computer of your own and you are trying to leak something, an internet cafe or other public terminal that sees use by several people might be an effective way of hiding that you sent something.  If you don&#x27;t own a computer of your own you have no trusted place you can go to generate a PGP key, to set its passphrase securely, to encrypt email before you use the public terminal, to decrypt what you retrieved from the public terminal on your home machine (so your passphrase can&#x27;t be keylogged or your key cannot be copied), and so forth.  If you use a mass-market operating system (Windows, Mac OS X) you might have a computer that you own but cannot trust in any way.  That&#x27;s where opening a &quot;throwaway&quot; email address and sending something unencrypted is a viable use case.  If you muck it up by trying to encrypt using PGP then possession of the key is persuasive (but not conclusive) evidence that you are the one that sent the email, and quickly becomes conclusive evidence if even the most basic automated surveillance techniques are used on that untrusted machine.<p>>One could argue that GnuPG is actually safer on a public terminal than generic online email access, because if you keep your keys on a USB stick, it&#x27;s another critical piece of data that would have to get collected separately before the captured input data was of any use (this could be automated, but it&#x27;d be much harder than just running a keylogger, especially if one undertakes avoidance techniques).<p>One would be wrong.  If an adversary is keeping a copy of every file that is opened on a USB stick (which would be trivial to add as an &quot;update&quot;, &quot;patch&quot;, or &quot;option&quot; to, say, an on-demand antivirus scanner) then it&#x27;s game over.<p>>If one accesses an ordinary email service, the log would look like &quot;gmail.comcookiecapermypassword&quot;, which obviously contains all information necessary to access an account. As long as the private key is not automatically copied by the terminal, you can simply change your passphrase after each usage of a public terminal and it simply won&#x27;t matter if someone stole your input or not.<p>If they have your key from the previous step then changing your passphrase does absolutely &quot;jack&quot; and &quot;shit&quot;.  Where are you going to change this passphrase anyway that&#x27;s on a computer owned/trusted by you if you don&#x27;t own a computer or don&#x27;t want to tie that key back to your home machine and identity?<p>>The only issue is that in the real world, most terminals do not have GnuPG installed. We should be using taking this opportunity to try to change that, while public interest is on the topic.<p>Then you&#x27;ll have backdoored copies of GnuPG installed on these machines that will offer you no security.",1377005692

No one will say this publicly, and Cameron and team are still hyping 60fps in general while not committing to anything. But there are fears that if shot at 60fps, theres no clean way to play the movie at 24fps in some theaters an easier transition for 48fps but even untested in 48 given that that issue helped derail the move to SMPTE DCP for The Hobbit release. And fear that current playback gear cant do 450Mb/s at 60fps. Gear manufacturers say they can do 500Mb/s, but the studios in reality have to settle for less, due to the bit-rate bottlenecks in various systems.<p>Never thought about that but yes it makes sense that the conversion from 48fps to 24fps is easy whereas the one from 60fps to 24fps seems impossible or cumbersome. If this is delaying the 60fps age, then I&#x27;m really sad about it :(",1377004208

It is not a revelation that plaintext email can technically be looked at by people beyond the sender and recipient.  And it&#x27;s not clear what in any reported stories would specifically relate to Groklaw&#x27;s use of email.<p>What it seems to come down to is the general fear that the NSA COULD, from a technical perspective, be reading specific unencrypted emails.  But before the recent news stories, did PJ (or anyone else) really send and receive emails thinking &quot;there is no way the NSA, or anyone else, can see this email&quot;?<p>As far as chilling effects go, the knowledge that a multi-billion dollar signals intelligence agency is technically capable of reading an unencrypted email seems pretty mild.  Is free speech and free communication really so fragile that it rests on the idea that casual communication you make no special effort to protect is totally out of the reach of large police or intelligence organizations?",1377003811

Only the upper tiers have influence and the utter richest minority are likely to get what they want.<p>In both the US and where I am in Australia, the two major parties are barely different and doubly so in regards to this whole issue. A vote is not going to mean a great deal.<p>But a vote that can make some difference is voting with our wallets. Can very conscious purchasing decisions made by more and more people remove some of the influence held by the very richest on our planet? Is that too dreamy?<p>Where possible, I try to avoid purchasing from the biggest brand in any category, but there&#x27;d be a lot, lot more I could do about this. If we imagine the typical food pyramid, but fill it with brands and apply it to every product and category showing the richest and most influential at one end and the delightful smallfry at the other, could we help motivate people to make better decisions about where they spend their money? Or even where they earn it? Earn a fraction less to work for a smaller supplier perhaps.<p>Apps, surveys, social media, gamification - these are all things that might help people make more careful decisions. Ride a bike, grow food or buy from independent greengrocers at least, seek out furniture that&#x27;s locally made, etc.<p>Give me a site/app that asks me about my life and rates my efforts or motivates me to make a better choice in everything I do.

Thanks to migpwr for pointing out that facebook was just an example of the generational gap, not the point of why facebook is good or bad.<p>2. The generational age issue has never been more salient than it is now since the periods between meaningful technological changes are shortening significantly.<p>3. I'm over 30 and writing/building companies based on these technologies but I'm doing so as more of an outsider than an insider like before.",1182358473

29580,comment,29578,29578,0,0,mxh,,,"The 2nd-to-last paragraph is what caught my attention ... <i>if</i> the legislation discussed passed, and <i>if</i> it were extended to other private partnerships, that seems like it would eat into the mgmt. fees of most VCs.<p>And that would seem likely to reduce the number of VC firms, at least.  (Less profit = less motivation to enter the business.)  It's very speculative, but interesting.",1182358105
29579,comment,29527,29542,0,0,nostrademons,,,"The class of 2007 absolutely will get bored with Facebook - I know many members of it that got bored with MySpace before it, and LiveJournal before that, and Xanga before <i>that</i>.<p>But in the process, they will have explored every feature of it, added dozens of third-party apps, started using it in ways the developers never intended, and possibly created a few competitors. <p>The point of the article, as I understood it, was to not let ""But it'll be obsolete in five years!"" be a reason to keep you from learning something new.  Of course it'll be obsolete in five years.  Chances are, your job will be too, and we'll all be using some website or technology or whatever that hasn't been invented yet.<p>FWIW, I have a FaceBook account, a MySpace, 2 Livejournals, 3 PlanWorlds (that's an Amherst-only social network), 2 Bloggers, a DeadJournal, a GreatestJournal, a uJournal, and a Plog.  I don't use all of them regularly, but I do keep up with a good half-dozen or so of them.",1182358044

29574,comment,29527,29565,0,0,abstractbill,,,"The point I took away from the article is this:  There are things I have enough experience of that I will never do them (installing Vista was the example from the article).  But there <i>may</i> be things that I would learn along the way if I did install Vista that would be useful to me in some random venture.",1182357524

29571,comment,29516,29516,0,0,maxklein,,,"Well, I'm sure this is useful in some manner. However, I've never even seen a hurricane, and a hurricane has never affected my life. So I'll leave the commentary for those people whose cat has been raped by a hurricane...",1182356283
29570,comment,29516,29560,0,0,wensing,,,"Great idea!  Have you seen www.surfline.com?  Maybe we could advertise there once we get the Pacific going (which wouldn't be a colossal amount of work with the systems we have in place...). ",1182356200
29569,comment,29335,29557,0,0,palish,,,"<i>Great</i> info, <i>great</i> detail.  Thanks so much for your time.  I've never even considered looping through recursion.  The construct-a-new-world vs modify-the-current-world situation was exactly the problem I was thinking of.  And you followed it up with a paper, if I wanted to learn more.  It's hard to emphasize how perfect stuff like this is for a newcomer to Lisp.  There should be more snippets like this.  You should write a tutorial somewhere.",1182356118

29567,comment,29480,29480,0,0,create_account,,,"Great point about since VCs don't give you an outright ""no"", you should take that opportunity to go back to them with a revised idea.<p>Too many people (me included) tend to never go back.",1182355971

I've taken out the buttons and added short instructions (""Click a picture to vote!"").<p>Is the Social News link noticeable?  I'm wondering if the social news page should be the home page, because that's probably more useful and would get more traffic.",1182355282

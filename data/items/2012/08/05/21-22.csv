4342795,comment,4342617,4342738,1,0,gkuan,,,"Hmm, that may be true. There are certainly a lot of recent locked handsets one can only buy in a post-paid package in the US. In my experience, however, post-paid overage rates can be quite substantial too (plus any so-called ""cramming""). Some of the carriers have been pushing prepaid unlimited plans (some including data, throttled after certain thresholds of course) at pretty attractive price points (usually advertised in terms of a price inclusive of all taxes and fees unlike post-paid). It has worked out well for me so far (crossing fingers). There is also the phenomenon where in Asian and European countries people pay the full unsubsidized cost of the latest and greatest phone AND for a post-paid plan. Just curious, what other inflexibilities have you encountered?",1344203957

He wanted to write it as if it was part of that package, and as such it would re-use the original version of that code. So he went ""out of his way"" to help Oracle and this is how they've repaid him.<p>I understand that the circumstances of an ex-employee contributing to an open source codebase and wanting to do things right by not unnecessarily duplicating code might be too much for your average jury, but it should be made clear to those who can understand that this is utterly appalling behaviour by Oracle, rather than a case of a sloppy Google employee getting away with a small amount of IP theft.",1344203706

Making something that is usable & simple is still hard work. But the actual processes behind tickets is fairly straightforward.<p>I've built a system for the planning and seating of VIP hospitality packages that has been used for Beijing & London as well as the last Rugby World cup. Admittedly my ticket app is only for a select group of clients & users, so I haven't needed to scale anywhere near to the same degree as LOCOG, but I have done so with other sites in the past and the scaling techniques are the same.<p>That said, with the benefit of hindsight, I think the ideal way to have done ticket resale, would have been for people to register interest in events, possibly taking payment information in advance. Any inventory released back to LOCOG could have then been randomly offered to people who'd registered interest. There would be some element of first-in first served, but you're always going to get that with oversubscribed events.",1344203693

As soon as you get to a mach number where a parachute can deploy stably (about mach 1.8 and below) you deploy it to stabilise the thing, and of course the drag is much greater than entry body alone.<p>>> Another thing is the crane mechanism, which is to protect the rover from the debris kicked up from the rocket motors.

The reasons include:<p>-Having rovers drive off from on top of things is difficult, it puts the CoG of the lander right up and if you have to drive off a sloped ramp having landed on a slope, the ramp can be really very sloped.<p>-Rocket forces nearer the ground can be quite an interesting control problem, in terms of the forces generated when you're near the ground and where all the exhaust goes.<p>-Having rocket fuel tanks landing on spikey rocks has the potential to really ruin your day.<p>-Knowing when to turn the rocket engines off (i.e. successfully detecting landing) is actually quite a hard problem. It's a very noisy problem, and getting it wrong was what destroyed Mars Polar Lander (i.e. it thought it landed when it was still up in the air, and so fell out of the sky).

4342641,comment,4342274,4342474,11,0,jengel,,,"I am not a hardware guy, so I'll shy away from ignorantly answering the question about hardware significance.  My limited understanding, however, is that equipment that operates in the higher frequency ranges is exotic and currently quite expensive.  That's why you primarily only see satellites utilizing the >6 GHz range (RADAR and microwave backhaul links being two other applications in the higher frequency range [1]).  One of the problems in the higher-frequency range is increased attenuation due to oxygen and water absorption [2].<p>Why would the military interested in higher-frequency communications?  I can think of a couple of reasons of the top of my head:<p>1) There has been significant pressure over the last couple of years from Congress (lobbied by commercial carriers) to reallocate spectrum from the federal government and to auction it to commercial carriers [3].  With increasingly advanced communications systems and waveforms being deployed in the military which require significantly more bandwidth, that means they have to do more with less.  Shannon's law tells us that higher frequencies are capable of more bandwidth than the lower frequencies, which means high-frequency RF could transfer a lot more information than low-frequency RF systems [4].  This is important given the military's push towards buzzwords like ""sensor fusion"".<p>2) High-frequency communications systems are point-to-point rather than broadcasting over a wide area.  Think of how light propagates from a laser pointer versus a light bulb.  Low-frequency broadcasts, such as TV stations, propagate over a wide area of land from a single antenna.  High-frequency microwave communications, such as the white cylindrical drums you see on cell towers, are directional and require the communication antennas to more or less be pointing directly at each other.  There are three advantages of these point-to-point antennas: A) higher bandwidth, as discussed earlier, B) much lower likelihood of detection by your enemy, since your communications are targeted rather than broadcasted, and C) lower probability of interception by your enemy, because they would have to place an antenna directly in the path between your two links in order to capture your signal.<p>3) RADAR systems can be significantly more accurate in the higher frequencies, allowing more precise targeting and identification of targets.  This has major applications both within and outside the military.  The Doppler Radars are an example of a non-military application that provides weather information about the US [5].  The more accurate they can make the RADARS, the better they can distinguish between cloud formations and therefore provide more accurate weather predictions.<p>(Disclosure: I was previously involved in the battles between commercial carriers and US Federal Government regarding reallocation of spectrum.

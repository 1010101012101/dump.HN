Shannon did a lot of amazing work before the seminal 1948 paper. As an example, here are his M.Sc. and Ph.D. thesis:<p><i>A symbolic analysis of relay and switching circuits</i>: <a href=""http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/11173"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/11173</a><p><i>An algebra for theoretical genetics</i>: <a href=""http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/11174"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/11174</a><p>Shannon was quite a unique thinker. I would dare to say that very few people had such tremendous impact on the world via abstract thinking. He single-handedly enabled the digital revolution. And though a lot is known about his contributions, less is known about his personality, interests and style. Thus, I believe the submitted article is indeed quite an interesting read, despite the fact that it's not about the mathematical theory of communication.",1249905598

752628,comment,752499,752499,0,0,jacquesm,,,"FTA: ""Your servers and desktops don’t reach out into the great beyond and allocate more memory or CPU cycles from “the cloud” when necessary. That would require an entirely new operating system model that simply doesn’t exist at the moment regardless of the haphazard slapping of “cloud” tags onto operating systems and products that is happening right now.""<p>That already happens though, sure there is a lot of 'mislabelling' (read marketing) going on. But thin client applications that use the cloud for the 'heavy lifting' exist and will be more common as the cloud services expand to accomodate this model.<p>Right now you can pretty much get storage on demand through SAAS from any number of vendors.<p>You could have a front-end to your application running on a local machine and a backend of 100's of cpus 'in the cloud'. A cloud hosted renderfarm is a good example of this.<p>It's not simple yet, and it usually involves a bunch of pieces of custom software (though MPI does a pretty good job of talking to the cloud for stuff like this).<p>The reasons why it will take a while for Carrs' vision to become reality is not that it is hard to allocate compute, storage and memory 'in the cloud'. It's just that applications in general for regular users do not need such heavy resources, and secondly that plenty of data can not be allowed off-site because of privacy concerns and security.<p>Another reason, and maybe this is the biggest, is that cloud services are simply too expensive for what you can get if you spend the money on servers and bandwidth directly. It only really makes economical sense if you need large numbers of machines for a very short period.",1249905544

There's been far more work put into the recommendations engine than the graph DB and the beginnings of the engine predate the DB.  The original prototypes worked with our Store class, which is the DB abstraction that the engine sees, and were purely in-memory and then there were a number of things that I swapped in to replace the storage layer, eventually settling on our own DB.<p>That said, I do have one big blog post half-written on ""the problems of sparse data"" that I'll eventually roll out.",1249902402

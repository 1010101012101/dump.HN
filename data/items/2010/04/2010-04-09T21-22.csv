I'm simply voicing my opinion just like you are. It's all good.<p>On to your points. If I was upset at my phone's browser (and believe me, my phone's browser shouldn't even be <i>called</i> a browser) I would just look for a better phone, one with a browser I liked. Same with the DVD player. I don't think that's what we're talking about here though. It's more like your DVD player vendor was saying ""you can circumvent the FBI warnings, but only if you do it while singing the alphabet backwards""... well, if I cared about the FBI warnings that much and had the time to spare and otherwise enjoyed that DVD player, I'd just do it the way they wanted. I just have better (from my perspective, of course) things to worry about than ""HEY, they should let me remove those warnings while singing <i>anything I want</i>!""...<p>To get back to specifics and away from stupid analogies: It is true that I'd prefer to write an iPhone app in Ruby than in Objective-C. I just don't think that my preference is Apple's problem. They're just doing fine without me, after all. This could come back to bite them, but then again it might not. So I'm perfectly happy to agree to disagree here.<p>So to reiterate. I don't think this is not significant, just that it is not significant to me. I didn't mean for my comment to be taken literally as a ""no, you should all stop caring"", even if I came across that way.<p>Cheers.",1270850356

They arbitrarily had closed off their harbors and borders (no native 3rd party iPhone apps) but then saw the opportunity to make a lot of money and opened the doors.  (iPhone SDK and App Store.)<p>We should not be surprised when a totalitarian state employs arbitrary coercive actions in its own interest, and this is not the first such maneuver by a closed source company.   We should be in the mindset of people doing business in a totalitarian state.  We should be aware that there is an iron hand under that velvet glove and that equitable treatment under that regime is motivated by that regime's self interest, not by a principle like the rule of law.<p>Open Source = The Rule of Law?

I make enough that I am well above the 50K referenced in the article, but by the time I deduct interest on my home loan, I'm much closer. I don't pay any federal income tax. I get back everything that is withheld, and even more than that. I get what is called the ""Additional child tax credit"" which basically means that whatever portion of the Child Tax Credit is left over after wiping out the taxes I owed, I get back as a credit which ads to my refund. This more than compensates for any state income tax and property taxes.<p>It does not, however, come anywhere near compensating for FICA and Medicare, which are real taxes, plain and simple, and of the worst kind: In my age group, I will never see the benefit of these dollars which they steal from me today. Anything I would have paid in federal tax is dwarfed by it. There are no deductions, no exemptions. Even if I get the paltry SSI checks when I retire, the dollar will have lost so much value that the benefit is a mere trifle compared to the taxation that ""funded"" it. The only good thing I can say about FICA and Medicare is that they are a flat tax, or even a regressive tax since the highest earners do not pay it on all their income.<p>It also does not compensate for sales taxes, nor for all the gas tax I pay, the cigar luxury tax (75% here in MN, and that's on top of the SCHIP taxes), and thousands of other hidden taxes contained in the prices of the products that I and my family consumes.<p>And to use this fact as an excuse to tax middle to low-income families even more - shameful.",1270849208

Most of the time, they took a usable photograph. The pro news photographers said, 'But you can't expect an untrained person to take good photographs!' And they insisted that the papers stop sending out camera-armed news reporters.<p>The thing with that, though, was that if you John Random Reporter couldn't take pictures of near-equivalent quality to a John Pro Photographer, the papers would stop doing it. But they didn't. If the photographers' point was true, they had nothing to worry about. But they knew they did indeed have something to worry about. The truth was that the amateurs could come close enough to equalling the pros that the trade off versus cost savings was worth it.<p>There is a parallel here with closed versus open systems. We howl, 'You can't do that!! Closed systems canot possibly equal the innovation and development of open!!' And if that's the case, we have nothing to worry about. Quite possibly, though, that is not the case. The insistence on closed that seems so anathema to much of the history of software development may in fact be a good thing for the end user, and our howls of outrage nothing more than being called on something that is no longer true.<p>That sense of threat would at least explain the inordinate number of HN stories on this topic.",1270848094

Now, I would never consider myself a ""unique or beautiful little"" anything, but I do strive for excellence and I think most good developers/DBAs/any other position that requires any creativity also do that.  This does mean that <i>the good ones</i> are not cogs where you can easily substitute one of us for another.  I would be reluctant to work for any company that wanted to treat me as a replaceable cog.  While I have done it in the past and would do it again in the future if I had to, I think and hope I am long past the point where I would have to work for a company like that again.<p>As for the adaptation, I agree to a degree.  Starting any new job involves adaptation.  With that said, what kind of adaptation the company expect plays a large role in how interested I would be in the job.  A company that expects me to adapt because they are on the bleeding edge of tech, or wants me to work with something that is both new to me and interesting will find me quite eager.  One that expects me to adapt because they are using say SQL Server 6.5 on Windows NT will not find me so eager.<p>If a company is hiring commodity coders to create yet more basic CRUD apps, then the company holds all the cards and can be very picky.  If a company is looking for truly good, experienced developers/DBAs/engineers that are capable of working independently and substantial new projects, then the company is no longer looking for a cog in the machine and they are more likely to find a good candidate by remembering that fact and acting accordingly.",1270847535

7483819,comment,7479478,7480196,1,0,pault,,,"Personal anecdote: I grew up in Seattle, and I was terrified of earthquakes for my whole childhood.  Every time my apartment building would sway at night it would jolt me out of my sleep in a cold sweat.  I did a few semesters at a design school on the waterfront that was built on top of a landfill which is predicted to liquify during a large earthquake and swallow the first 1-2 floors of the structures there.  One day, while walking to class, I stopped to talk to a construction crew fixing cracks in the viaduct and they told me the entire waterfront sinks approximately 1 inch every year and requires constant repair to the infrastructure there.  I&#x27;ve since moved to the atlantic coast and plan to avoid the pacific rim for the rest of my life. :)",1395957586

It&#x27;s just decluttering, and relegating that important function to one of many miniscule, <i>unlabelled</i> icons. It&#x27;s not &quot;performing too well&quot; by rendering links in the same colour as body text, and making the search function look like a header: it&#x27;s just making them subtly less obvious, which matters when your users are in the hundreds of millions and some of them really aren&#x27;t that savvy. \n(Possibly it matters even more with casual users who are web-savvy, in that you&#x27;re missing an opportunity to <i>encourage</i> them to search by prominently positioning the sort of medium white box that makes them think about searching)<p>Whatever is cleanest and most elegant is not necessarily the most user-friendly design, never mind the optimal design from the point of view of user engagement.",1395957550

Possible recovery actions include (copied from NFSN):<p>* You provide a scanned copy of a government-issued photo ID.\n* You provide a scanned copy of a statement showing both the most recent deposit and a name and address matching one of your accounts.\n* You complete SMS verification. (SMS must be previously configured.)\n* You complete 2-factor verification. (2-factor auth must be previously configured.)\n* You correctly answer your security question. (Security question and answer must be previously configured, below.)\n* You use an ssh key to create a file with a specific name on one of your sites hosted here.

Manufacturers are tight-lipped about how they&#x27;re using the FPGAs, but it appears to be for ultra-rapid reconfiguration of analog circuit topologies without the load time delays that result from a traditional microcontroller > D/A converter arrangement. There are also field-programmable analog arrays on the market, but I have yet to see one in a commercial product and it seems like they have some way to go before being economical for audio synthesis applications.<p>I love FPGAs although I don&#x27;t know much about how to et started with programming them.

And Ford changed the equation with the Model T, by making an affordable, readily available car - thereby jump-starting the car economy worldwide.<p>We CAN do the same thing with housing. By eliminating the speculative incentives on housing (as is done in Germany) through capital gains taxation, and through multiple non-residence ownership taxation, we can address some of the market structures that diminish affordability. And on the other side we can create growth opportunities, through zoning primarily - such as a reduction in the required number of parking spaces per residence unit - and through a reduction in average square footage (which has been growing in America over the last 30 years) --<p><a href=""http://www.census.gov/const/C25Ann/sftotalmedavgsqft.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.census.gov/const/C25Ann/sftotalmedavgsqft.pdf</a><p>And while this is just a start.

7483713,comment,7480857,7482625,3,0,jandrewrogers,,,"What makes spatial indexing different than other areas of computer science is that its fundamental operands are interval types (like hypercubes). Almost all other areas of computer science focus on solutions that only work on point-like data and so many idioms and intuitions computer scientists use are not actually valid when dealing with spatial representations. Data types that require no less than two integers to describe break the assumptions of computer science developed for data types that require one integer to describe.<p>Oddly, there are almost no people working on the computer science of spatial representations and indexing. That was how I became involved in the first place; I needed solutions to specific problems for which no active research was being done in academia (and I was talking to people like Samet at the time). And to this day, academics <i>still</i> aren&#x27;t doing any interesting work on spatial structures.<p>The algorithms are not classified, just not published. There are a couple patents out there on spatial sieves -- I am the inventor on the first practical one -- but more sophisticated and advanced variants exist that will probably never be patented. Widmayer (respected CS academic) was the first to propose this approach to the problem of generalized interval indexing but a useful algorithm was not discovered until my work in 2007.<p>The point indexing algorithm family I mentioned has never been patented or published anywhere but was based on the development of a novel theoretical CS construct that allows the expression of polymorphic space-filling curves. These are essentially adaptive to the information theoretic properties of the high-dimensionality data set but still embarrassingly parallel and distributable. I don&#x27;t think these are being used in production anywhere (yet) but they&#x27;ve been around for several years. Very cool but the number of people that grok them can be counted on one hand.<p>All modern research on computing with spatial representations is being done at one of a few companies, which is why nothing is published. People like me, and I haven&#x27;t done the pure research in years, don&#x27;t have time to generate hundreds of pages of fairly deep content. Consequently, learning advanced spatial indexing is fairly prohibitive; you have to figure it out yourself, which is far from easy, or be at one of the handful of places where they are using it.",1395956617

I can recognize reminders of it in old stories of first white people settling to North America, exploring wagon routes to west or exploring Klondike. Even more recent climpses can be seen in todays light reality series like &#x27;extreme makeover&#x27;, &#x27;undercover boss&#x27; where good hearted people are working 2-3 jobs just to provide their family and kids.<p>Should we all then try to reach &#x27;Sisu mode&#x27;, my answer is no or only when really needed. As in that Wiki article famous Finnish rock singer compares Sisu and adrenaline, I partly agree with him. Adrenaline is not Sisu, but probably when you are in &#x27;Sisu mode&#x27; adrenaline is pumping full.

For all I know he may have changed his mind since prop 8 was passed over 5 years ago - lots of other Californians have, if opinion polls are to be believed. He wrote a blog post in 2012 defending his right to keep personal opinions and professional life separate, so chances are that he was still against gay marriage then and now, but I really don&#x27;t know what his specific views are just from the fact of his having made a donation. Even if he has not, it seems to me that he&#x27;s still entitled to hold a personal opinion that gay marriage is a bad idea as long as he doesn&#x27;t promote or promulgate that belief in the workplace or in the Mozilla foundation&#x27;s policies.<p>I did read Hampton Catlin&#x27;s call for a boycott, but while trying to learn more about the issue I also read blogs from LGBT people at Mozilla who already work with Eich and say they&#x27;re fine with him as CEO.

Last I checked, the FPGA vendors will not open their toolchains up, and not even document the bitstream formats.  They will claim NDA, proprietary, etc.  This has the massive side effect that you are stuck with their bloated, slow, crappy toolchains.  If this were open, I guarantee hackers would be inventing all kinds of interesting ways to convert their software into FPGA bits.<p>2. FPGAs are VERY hard to write and debug.  You have to write your design in an HDL language (either VHDL or Verilog), and you have to use a software simulator to prototype the design on first (and of course these tools are either quite pricy or if free they are usually limited or hard to use).  Then you can synthesize the design and download it into the FPGA for running.<p>The next problem is debugging your design.  The entire internal state of the FPGA is only accessible through slow scan, unless you dedicate a portion of your design to &quot;monitors&quot;, which tap the traffic and store their values into internal RAMs.  So you may have to respin the design just to get more monitors to debug where the issue is.<p>3. FPGA compilation is SLOW.  When I used them professionally a few years ago, a Virtex5 could take multiple hours to resynthesize/place & route a medium-sized design.  I believe that Virtex7 they are advertising could take over a day to respin if you change your design.<p>4. Most new machines already have a built-in graphics with a GPU that can be utilized as a general-purpose GPU.  No one ships FPGAs in any conventional computer.",1395956090

Or is there some sort of &quot;engagement longevity&quot; which might show a better timeline keeps people visiting more often over a longer period of time?<p>The other possible approach would be to see what could be done to make events and profile pages more appealing to spend time on.  There may not be a way to do that if the timeline satisfies people, but it would be worth investigating.",1395955880

Throw in talk of the Great Recession and how dare these companies perpetrate such outrages when these hard working less-compensated engineers were barely hanging onto their houses with some sob stories with real faces, and testimony from compensation experts that yes, if so-and-so in the Valley got their &quot;fair&quot; compensation that is 150% of their current level, then whosit in Podunk, Middle America would get at least a 15% bump as the overall scale goes up everywhere.

So all sorts of visas get snarled up for a year or two, tying up various projects, driving up costs of this even more.<p>There are some interesting PR angles that Apple and Google can engage in to nip this sort of trial-by-heart-tugs, but I bet they will get control on the media image and quash this whole affair in the mainstream news media well before it gets to that stage. If they can limit any fallout litigation and the media coverage especially to just within the industry itself and not let it seep out into severe regulatory sanctions or public consciousness, then the cost-benefit of the cartel will work out fine.

7483470,comment,7480582,7483321,1,0,Snail_Commando,,,"> I&#x27;d like to point out, however, that there several thriving biotech incubators around the country. Surely the demand must be coming from somewhere when tenants must be found to pay the bills. Indeed, I think the startups that enter an incubator space are well aware of the rent prices, and do so to to take advantage of the certified lab space provided which is impractical to build on one&#x27;s own.<p>Yep, I was <i>just</i> about to update my answer with the following:<p>--[I want to emphasize that there isn&#x27;t inherently wrong with co-working spaces. They just aren&#x27;t in the same class as [YC, 500s, Techstars]<p>Also, I read up on Harlem, they claim that they are providing laboratory space. That&#x27;s a pretty solid value add. So I can understand why they may be wary of losing their investment in capital.<p>I didn&#x27;t consider this, but there is an argument to be made that things are different in more capital intensive industries. Unlike software, the incubator model may be more palatable in these industries.<p>Still, I think they should hypothetically re-price equity demands compared to software equity demands, not charge per unit. Just demand more equity.<p>Charging entrepreneurs is still bad signaling and can lead to adverse selection (if you market yourself as being equivalent to [YC 500s Techstars])--<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------<p>> A takeway from all this, for me, is that I&#x27;m wondering what one could do to make a biotech-focused YC a workable model. Unfortunately, the (comparatively) glacial pace of biotech startups dampens a lot of enthusiasm.<p>Honestly, I think it&#x27;s a bit early for the YC model in biotech. Too many subsets of the market are just too capital intensive, time expensive, and subject to regulatory burden.<p>However, with exciting technologies like CRISPR and high throughput sequencing starting to come on to the scene, genetic engineering and DNA derived technologies may be much more viable as a low capital cost subset of the market. Also, DNA looks suspiciously like software embedded on extremely high density storage tape to me... :)",1395954353

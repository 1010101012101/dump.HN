714262,comment,712974,713572,0,0,ralphb,,,"This comments seems a little bit shortsighted. Where do you stop? Is it okay if you write your own interface to the hardware drivers, bypassing DirectX/OpenGL? Or do you also have to write your own drivers to the graphics and sound? Your own operating system? Design your own hardware? There's no such thing as an ""all-in"" app.<p>All of those things have certainly been done on the demoscene. In the demoscene, size-limited competitions have implicit convections, unwritten rules if you will, to ensure that everybody competes on fair terms. For 4kb intros it is currently accepted (if not encouraged) to use the DirectX/OpenGL APIs. It is also considered acceptable to use the font-writing API's, and some groups exploit this to generate vector graphics out of obscure font symbols.<p>For sound, it's expected that you either write your own software synthesizer (or collaborate with somebody who has written one), or use the MIDI APIs. For 1kb intros, MIDI API sounds are expected. There was a big controversy in 2008, when the 4kb intro Texas (<a href=""http://pouet.net/prod.php?which=51448"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pouet.net/prod.php?which=51448</a>) won the 4kb competition at NVScene. Many people considered its use of samples from mp3s included with the Windows operating system cheating, since it went outside the bounds of what is considered acceptable use of the OS resources.<p>So there are some implicit conventions about what you can and cannot do, and if you want to compete fairly and impress your fellow sceners, you should follow them.<p>Of course, most demoscene parties feature the wild demo competitions, where pretty much anything goes. Demosceners always reward hard work and clever hacks, so if you want to impress, create a demo on your self-built hardware and enter into this competition. You will have a fair chance at one of the prizes.",1248087496
714261,comment,713378,713378,0,0,tetha,,,"Being a pretty rational person, for me it always helps to focus on emotions and understand what the source of this emotion is, Why do I feel this? What is the reason? Does it make sense? Once you grok why your soul tells you things, you can react to them in appropiate ways, because you know the deep reason behind it.<p>This has helped me a lot with the fear of doing mistakes during development, because I understood that I hesitate to develop things, because often, I just lost interest. Since I understood this, I looked around for lightweight direction management and found something and use it. And even more, whenever this fear of mistakes crops up again, I usually can recognize the pattern (simply stopping to program, not beginning to type with some vi open, getting tired) and re-reason why this is not entirely true.<p>This has helped me to overcome some long growing dislike of completely dark areas, as there was always the fear of some danger jumping at one from the darkness. Understanding that usually nothing will be there and furthermore, beginning to train martial arts has helped with this (training MA does help a lot with respect to confidence)<p>This has and is helping me a lot understanding why I have problems at interacting with groups of people. It appears that I fear rejection very much, and thus, I usually want to see a persons reaction precisely whenever I interact with them. In a group of people with more then 3 persons, this just does not work, as it is just too much information to cope. I am working on this, though.<p>So, overall, I would say that meditating about ones feelings and the reasons why those feelings occur is good way to understand the feelings and the underlying problem, and given that, one will find how to handle this feeling and how to get this feeling out of the way for your daily work (or, you will understand that it is impossible to get out of the way. Talk with your boss then, and hope he will understand your reasoning).",1248087482

I'm really optimistic about our future, and thinking a little bit about how we got here.<p>We offer a couple services to newspapers -- especially small, weekly newspapers -- to help them get their advertisement management out of a filing cabinet on onto the computer.  Our first effort seems like it was pretty far removed; we wanted to build a community for artists to share and trade supplies and materials on a super-local scale.  It probably would've been a lot of fun to make, but a lot of trouble to drum up interest and make money off of.<p>However, as we dig deeper into the newspaper industry, it seems like we have to answer a lot of the same questions, especially regarding the nature of local advertising and the incentive for small, local businesses to advertise on the web.<p>Are you, as an entrepreneur, attracted to the same problems over and over again?

714249,comment,713959,714239,0,0,alexandros,,,"First author of HTTP 1.1 is Roy Fielding, same guy who defined REST. In fact, http 1.1 was designed largely to make HTTP restful. As such, you'd be surprise how far HTTP goes towards RESTfulness. For instance the spec defines idempotency and satfety of methods. Ergo, servers may produce valid requests and responses but still fail when it comes to being valid http if their internal operation does not conform to the operation semantics. Look up the google web accelerator fiasco to see how things can go terribly wrong.",1248086506

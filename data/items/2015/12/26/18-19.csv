It runs, it switches between emacs, Firefox and a good console just fine.  It&#x27;s infinitely more work to get Windows or an OS X box to the same level of functionality, because neither of them properly supports all of these key features: POSIX; a Common Lisp tiling window manager (which means I always have a REPL a slime-connect away); native X11.<p>I literally <i>never</i> miss Windows or OS X.",1451156381

Calling it a &quot;firewall failure&quot; makes it sound ridiculous, and I agree that it shades everything under a nefarious tone. But since campaigns are chock full of lawyers, they might be using it in a legal sense, referring to a &quot;Chinese wall&quot; [1] that prevents certain communications to avoid conflict of interests. Unless access logs show that the Sanders campaign decided to suck up everything, it&#x27;s hard to argue that the DNC didn&#x27;t massively overreact here.<p>Whatever the case, what confuses me are the suggestions that these sorts of breaches are common and that they have been for some time. What the hell are these software vendors doing? Access control is nothing new. And while getting it right isn&#x27;t always easy, there&#x27;s no reason for you to continuously get it wrong, either.

10794813,comment,10791712,10794654,0,0,maaku,,,"We are delving into the realm of philosophy of the mind, and even epistemology, but what makes you think even human beings have what you call &quot;agency&quot; (which I think you are using as a stand-in for free-will)?<p>Common-sensical free-will is a nonsensical concept. We don&#x27;t make decisions based on a roll of the dice[0]. We decide to do things for <i>reasons</i>, because <i>justifications</i>. We come up with a list of options, we weight those options by how well we predict they will fulfill our goals, and we take the action which bubbles to the top. Free will, which again is what I think you are calling agency, is merely what it feels like from the inside to make a choice based on a fully deterministic utility calculation. You can program a computer to do the same.<p>Now the difference is that our value system is hideously complex and highly interconnected, and the vast majority of it is not accessible to conscious introspection. When we say &quot;I chose that because it felt right&quot; we are saying &quot;my insanely complex value system, which I have little insight into, assigned highest weight to that option.&quot;<p>A program, on the other hand, can be written with a very simple and straightforward goal system: maximize advertising revenue; maximize account value; maximize paperclip production. It has agency, as the word is typically used, to accomplish those goals.<p>Such a program would be simple-minded, but not stupid. It would be highly intelligent about how it goes about accomplishing its goals, but it would never question <i>why</i> it is working towards those goals and whether it should pick new goals. That&#x27;s not part of its program, nor something which it would choose to do as it is trivial to show that changing to new goals leads to not working towards the old goals.<p>Now with all that out of the way, can you see how it can be said that the behavior of the simple program is restricted to those actions which it best feels accomplish its simple goals? Certainly the program could be wrong on occasion, but it will always take actions which it thinks will best achieve its goals with the limited information and processing power available to it.<p>[0] unless we previously committed to physically rolling dice and accepting the outcome, in which case how did we choose to do that?",1451155637

The problem is that there are a bunch of cost and performance multipliers that are easy to overlook.<p>1. Only a portion of the rocket is reusable, you still pay full price for the upper stage.<p>2. The part that is reusable has to be built better to survive multiple uses and needs to have extra equipment for recovery, so it&#x27;s more expensive.<p>3. The performance of the reusable pieces is compromised due to the extra weight of the fuel and equipment for recovery.<p>4. There are still refurbishment costs after every flight, presumably we will know soon how significant these are.<p>5. You lose economies of scale in making the boosters since you make fewer of them.<p>Overall I would expect that with all of these together you&#x27;ll see maybe a 30% total cost reduction.

I think symbolic AI still holds some merit when thinking about how  to interact with traditional physical interfaces, no? There seems to be a complement in the methods when considering a full stack thinking and acting approach, but perhaps I&#x27;m being naive.<p>For example, if I&#x27;m a robot in the world, it would be easy for me to access interface knowledge, and how I could interact with it to complete my task, without needing to reason what the interface does or is. This gives me a basic understanding or knowledge base. Now if there is a higher level method of thinking that produces ingenuity, and as a result a more efficient method for solving a known problem, then I assert more modern techniques can be used to adjust older symbolic representations.<p>I&#x27;m just imagining how an android/autonomous agent would need to operate in the real world, perhaps akin to how we might perceive and function within it, a posse ad esse.<p>Also I use &#x27;agents&#x27; because I <i>am</i> going back through older research and it seems to fit the description of the entities involved (software, hardware, robots, devices, people). I don&#x27;t see any reason for some of the vocabulary or terms to have fallen out of favor.<p>In a world of autonomous intelligent multi-agent systems, there is a market for knowledge representation about the world, how to complete tasks, as well as higher level thinking/reasoning functions, et cetera.",1451155074

Common perception is that founder CEO&#x27;s call all the shots like some third world dictator whose word is law and cannot even be questioned.   Well, appearances can be deceiving.  I went from undergrad to CEO of a startup that my best friend and I founded.  I very much had a boss: our lead investor who settled in as Chairman of the Board and unleashed his domineering personality to run rampant on our weekly management calls.  I had an extreme amount of pressure from him to hit deadlines and hold ourselves accountable to our excel projections (which, like most early startup projections, were pretty useless to begin with).  Over time, as success bought some freedom from the board and investors, a few of our most important anchor clients filled their role instead.  I would spend months feeling like a certain VP or SVP at a make-or-break client for us was basically calling the shots in large areas of my life.  In hindsight what we were lacking was real mentorship, management guidance, and similar help, (unfortunately) none of which were included with capital from our investors.  We figured it out as we went along while taking flack from all sides.  Only later when we were acquired and I had a &#x27;&#x27;normal&#x27;&#x27; boss with a &#x27;&#x27;normal&#x27;&#x27; p&l, career oriented direct reports, etc, did I realize how different it is, in some ways worse but in some ways much better.  It was a heck of a lot more predictable and less stressful.  I didn&#x27;t have to pull any rabbits out of hats I just had to wander over to the rabbit cage and feed them.

What political parties typically put in their voter databases are people who&#x27;ve voted in their primary in N consecutive elections, typically N=2 or 3.

You can try this yourself, ideally with an Arduino and LED+button, or some other hard real-time capable system. But even with an ordinary PC, you can do an approximate test. First disable compositing to reduce latency. Be sure your monitor is in native resolution to avoid scaler latency. Using xterm (note that VTE based terminal emulators have a 40fps frame rate cap which unnecessarily increases latency), clear the terminal with control-L so you are not misled by scrolling, and compare &quot;sleep 0.05&quot; and &quot;sleep 0&quot;. 50ms seems like a reasonable conservative estimate for the remaining total latency of your keyboard and display, so you are comparing approx. 100ms vs 50ms latency, and the difference is very obvious.<p>And in the case of audio, humans are even more latency sensitive. Musicians generally aim for <20ms latency with soft-synths.<p>100ms is not an acceptable &quot;instant&quot; latency goal, especially as latency is cumulative and there&#x27;s likely to be a lot more latency in the chain that&#x27;s out of your control.",1451153339

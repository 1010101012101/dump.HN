1032443,comment,1032359,1032359,0,0,tom_pinckney,,,"My personal experience building two startup consumer websites has been that ORMs have been a mistake. Perhaps in enterprise environments where you have a large IT staff and want to isolate DB specifics and the whole data access layer ORMs may make sense. But for a nimble startup with a small number of talented programmers I think ORMs hurt more than they help for a couple of key reasons:<p>1) performance matters immensely to user experience and I can hand write much better SQL than any ORM I have seen can generate. Additionally I find it easier to predict how well my SQL will perform than to predict how the SQL generated by my ORM will perform.<p>2) I will likely never switch databases during the lifetime of my company and so switching SQL dialects is not a problem I face.<p>3) There is an impedance mismatch between tabular data stored in databases and object graphs that most ORMs represent.<p>4) The specifics of every ORM I've tried always left something to be desired. Hibernate was wicked complicated. Django didn't support multiple databases, SQLAlchemy was error-prone. I'm sure these specifics will get fixed over time, but for me they've just provided further disincentive.",1262703331

1032433,comment,1032209,1032209,0,0,grellas,,,"A highly informative overview of current FIDE ratings may be found here: <a href=""http://www.chessbase.com/newsdetail.asp?newsid=6027"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.chessbase.com/newsdetail.asp?newsid=6027</a>. Basically, this is a system by which chess grandmasters get rated based on their tournament play over a lengthy period.<p>The top chess players of recent years (post-Kasparov) are the trio of Kramnik (Russia), Topalov (Bulgaria), and Anand (India), with Anand being the current world champion and with Topalov scheduled to play him for the title in the very near future. Each of these guys has been at the top of his field for at least a decade and Magnus Carlsen has done nothing as yet to displace them from the very top. Even when it comes to the FIDE ratings, all these players are neck and neck (Carlsen: 2810; Topalov: 2801; Anand: 2790; Kramnik: 2788).<p>What is <i>amazing</i> here is not the absolute ratings but the prodigious nature of Carlsen's ascendancy to the highest rating in the world, which can be seen by comparing the following graphs showing the ratings progress from 2001-2010 for each of these players:<p>Carlsen: <a href=""http://ratings.fide.com/id.phtml?event=1503014"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ratings.fide.com/id.phtml?event=1503014</a>;
Topalov: <a href=""http://ratings.fide.com/id.phtml?event=2900084"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ratings.fide.com/id.phtml?event=2900084</a>;
Anand: <a href=""http://ratings.fide.com/id.phtml?event=5000017"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ratings.fide.com/id.phtml?event=5000017</a>;
Kramnik: <a href=""http://ratings.fide.com/id.phtml?event=4101588"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ratings.fide.com/id.phtml?event=4101588</a>.<p>As the graphs show, Topalov, Anand, and Kramnik have each had a 2700 or greater ranking (more or less without fail) for each of the years from 2000 through 2010. They are the old guard who have dominated the game for years. They have significant variations in their play (for example, Kramnik is super-methodical and cautious, preferring to grind his opponents slowly while opting for drawish variations in his manner of play while Topolav is a tremendous risk-taker who frequently likes to bust up the positions with wild variations and super-aggressive tactics) but the chess world has lived with this for some time now and there is nothing new here.<p>In contrast, Carlsen has moved in a virtually unbroken upward line from about a 2000 FIDE rating in year 2001 (when he was 10 years old) to his current 2810 rating in year 2010 (he is now 19). Thus, he represents the child prodigy coming into maturity as a breath of fresh air to the chess world - though he is not the world champion, for him, it is all potential future greatness and this has stirred tremendous excitement. It doesn't hurt that Carlsen is likable and is being mentored by Kasparov, who is perhaps the greatest grandmaster of modern times.",1262702906

I don't agree with their decision, but it is something they're aware of.<p>EDIT: There is a way to subclass models.Model and not have it be an abstract or real model (I don't remember at the moment) and you could, in that subclass, do a force_insert or force_update based on the PK status so that everything in your project inheriting from that subclass would have that behavior.<p>basically:<p><pre><code>  def save(self, *args, **kwargs):
      if self.pk:
          kwargs['force_update'] = True
          kwargs['force_insert'] = False

          kwargs['force_update'] = False
      super(MyModelBase, self).save(*args, **kwargs)

So, one can modify that behavior if they want to without having to patch too much - maybe someone can comment on subclassing models.Model while not having Django consider it a model (I think I got it from the Pro Django book if someone has it available).<p>EDIT2: modified the code to make sure that force_insert and force_update couldn't both be True.",1262702365

If one were going to set up a spam/phishing operation then the first thing would be to choose a domain like xyzcorp-messages.com. I'm sure that the blacklists look at domain age and prior performance too. Anything marked spam from a brand new domain, which appears to be a phishing domain, that has no history of not spamming associated with its ownership is surely going to pop into a blacklist faster.<p>You have some evidence experience to back up your suggestion?",1262701303

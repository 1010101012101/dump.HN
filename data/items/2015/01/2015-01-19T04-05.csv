HTTPS makes that challenging.<p>But specifically about your point, when one audits an HTTP/1.0 client, should one also audit the TCP/IP stack in the kernel?  I don&#x27;t think most researchers/engineers would, and would (for sake of practicality) instead trust the underlying systems.  Eventually, TLS will be thrown into that &quot;underlying systems&quot; bin.  That time is not likely at hand; there are still too many shortcomings of TLS and its surrounding infrastructure.  As evidenced at least by the OP.  But when the time does come, writing an HTTPS client in a weekend will be just as practical, since you&#x27;ll trust the software libraries/kernel to handle TLS.

You don&#x27;t use Hadoop to process 2GB of data, but you don&#x27;t build Googlebot using bash and wget. There is a scale past which it makes sense to use the Big Data toolbox. The point is that most people never get there. Your crawler is never going to be Googlebot.<p>> Is wget able to check whether a previously failed page exists on disk [in some kind of index] before making any new HTTP requests? It sounds like this would try fetching every failed URL until it reaches the point where it left off before the restart. If it&#x27;s not possible to maintain an index of unfetchable URLs and reasons for the failures then this would be one reason why wget wouldn&#x27;t work in place of software designed for the task of crawling (as opposed to just fetching).<p>It really depends what you&#x27;re trying to do here. If the reason you&#x27;re restarting the crawler is because e.g. your internet connection flapped while it was running or some server was temporarily giving spurious HTTP errors then you <i>want</i> the failed URLs to be retried. If you&#x27;re only restarting the crawler because you had to pause it momentarily and you want to carry on from where you left off then you can easily record what the last URL you tried was and strip all of the previous ones from the list before restarting.<p>But I think what you&#x27;re really running into is that we ended up talking about wget and wget isn&#x27;t really designed in the Unix tradition. The recursive mode in particular doesn&#x27;t compose well. It should be at least two separate programs, one that fetches via HTTP and one that parses HTML. Then you can see the easy solution to that class of problems: When you fetch a URL you write the URL and the retrieval status to a file which you can parse later to do the things you&#x27;re referring to.<p>> If you&#x27;re trying to saturate your connection with multiple wget instances, how do you make sure that you&#x27;re not fetching more than one page from a single server at once (being a friendly crawler)? Or how would you honor robots.txt&#x27;s Crawl-delay with multiple instances?<p>Give each process a FIFO to read URLs from. Then you choose which FIFO to add a URL to based on the address so that all URLs with the same address are assigned to the same process.",1421641248

In a restaurant I&#x27;d be more worried about a waiter not washing their hands after visiting bathroom  (the fact that there are placards saying they ABSOLUTELY MUST DO IT everywhere is kind of unnerving - if they insist on it so much is it the case that one reminder at the start of the employment is not enough?) than about the quiet dog under the table on the other end of the room. 
 There are also things like poorly trained dog doing &quot;what the dogs do&quot; in the airplane, and the owner not thinking about dog&#x27;s needs on a 5-hour flight. There are also sanitary and other concerns - e.g. in some places, it is clearly not appropriate to come with animals (most of these places, though, are not exactly open to public either). But I see no problem for a well-behaved dog (or other like animal, of course bengal tigers require an exception here) to accompany its owner to a restaurant or similar establishment - provided they don&#x27;t smell offensively, shed, make loud noise or otherwise disturb people. Of course, the responsibility should be on the owner and if the companion pet misbehaves or makes trouble, they both should be out, but as a consequence of a problem, not as a pre-determined conclusion.<p>Our family has pets and I have witnessed how many establishments view pets negatively - e.g. renting with a pet is a constant problem since many landlords, both private and corporate, want nothing to do with it.

8910245,comment,8909350,8909350,0,0,curiouscats,,,"It is sad how we allow rude people to get away with selfish behavior and make life for difficult for everyone else.  Doing so encourages rude people to be even more selfish and we get the kind of behavior you see discussed in the article.<p>Addressing the issues directly is often challenging.  That is my guess on why we allow degenerate behavior to impose costs on others until it reaches epidemic proportions when we finally attempt to address it.<p>It also encourages people to isolate themselves in enclaves where people that share certain expectations of behavior can shut out others and deal with those that are at least somewhat considerate of whatever behaviors the group cares about.<p>Allowing the rudest people to abuse society degrades the public square and tears at the benefits that can strengthen the social contract.  Sadly it seems to be a pretty dominate trait in our society these last few decades and it seems likely to just keep getting worse.  Hopefully I am wrong.",1421640143

There is no way to be perfectly certain.<p>That said one can apply an Occam&#x27;s calculus using whatever information and reasoning you do trust. I personally trust that, whomever the #GOP was, they were motivated by SONY&#x27;s role in developing &quot;the movie of terrorism&quot;. This seems to me to be consistent with what the group published and with their &#x27;Christmas surprise&#x27; showing collaboration between the State Department and SONY on the development of the movie related to its diplomatic value - something I don&#x27;t think the NSA or allies would do. So I think the group had NK sympathies in mind. Granted, this doesn&#x27;t rule out attribution to other states or hacktivists who hold these sympathies.",1421640079

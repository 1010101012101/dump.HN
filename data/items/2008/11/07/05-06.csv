356476,comment,356067,356410,0,0,Timothee,,,"Hold on a second: HD means a resolution of at least 1280x720. Anything lower than that is at best SD (720x480) but most probably less.\nI understand we're talking about online videos where the quality and resolution is clearly lower than what's done in the broadcast industry but the terms used should still mean the same thing.<p>So, overall, very few video sites out there are encoding in HD and especially not YouTube.<p>What DarkShikari is saying is that h.264 is the codec used to encode the video. h.264 can be used for videos for mobile to HD.\nHD is referring to the pixel resolution of the video. Both are completely independent.<p>I suppose that by ""not really based in reality"", you mean that most people doing HD are using h.264. That's true but that was not your question.",1226035814
356474,comment,356067,356410,0,0,DarkShikari,,,"What you said isn't true either--and I can confirm it, because two weekends ago I met with the guy who wrote the Youtube video encoder ;)<p>Youtube has no ""HD video""; the ""High Quality"" mode just sends you to the H.264 video, which isn't there for the primary purpose of being ""Higher Quality""--its in iPhone-compatible Baseline Profile, for the purpose of being compatible for mobile devices, in particular phones and such that they intend to provide support for.  If Google was really aiming at ""higher quality"" they would have chosen full-on High Profile H.264, but they intentionally chose Baseline for mobile compatibility.  Apparently storage was at enough of a premium that they explicitly chose not to have two formats available, and just chose the most compatible option.<p>The resolution chosen for the H.264 encoder is different <i>because its meant to be targeted at the iPhone</i>.  Again, the ""higher quality"" mode is a secondary feature; the real purpose is to target mobile devices.<p>Edit: Also, reading your post, what you said makes no sense--""they're encoding HD videos at higher resolution"", well, obviously, that's what HD means.  Are you sure you didn't mean to say ""they're encoding H.264 videos at higher resolution""?",1226035304

356465,comment,356324,356324,0,0,stillmotion,,,"Your problem is, you're thinking up ideas everyone else has thought up. I find when I'm demotivated, I'm really working on something I know will fail. If you don't believe in your product, you're going to fall short of any motivation very early into development.<p>Here's the tip, work small, but think big.<p>Focus on a niche, not the entire world. A dating site is nice and all, but, you've got eharmony.com, match.com, singles.com, and you're real big competitor, plentyoffish.com. A social network is nice and all, but you've got Facebook.<p>It sounds like your taste exceeds your skills. I know the feeling, and trust me it's the worst thing in the world. But if you want success, channel that frustration and make it work for you. Learn the fundamentals, and just try and try and try. Before you know it, you've gotten better. And as time progresses, you've become the best in your industry.<p>So three things. ONE: Be innovative. TWO: Be small. THREE: Hustle your face off.<p>--EDIT--<p>Oh yeah, another thing. Don't get caught up in the little things. If you really want to be an entrepreneur FOCUS ON THE BIG PICTURE. If you like programming, but feel like you're getting lost in all the fiddly bits, then find a framework or language that doesn't cost you time. If you like designing, but feel like you're wasting your time trying to figure out where elements go, find a great design and understand what makes it great. Look to others to show you the way so that you understand the bottom line. Time == motivation. Motivation == success. Success == Awesomeness.",1226034115

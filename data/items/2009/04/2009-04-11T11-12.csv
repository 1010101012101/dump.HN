The lawyer representing PG or his company would almost certainly insist on prepping him beforehand by reviewing with him, page by page, each of the documents the other side might ask him about. (Failure to prep a witness for deposition can result in the other side's playing a video for the jury, consisting of damaging sound bites harvested from the witness's testimony.)<p>The lawyer's prep of PG will likely include at least a glance at, and perhaps a discussion of, each of the EtherPad snapshot drafts for each of the documents in 'the PG collection.'<p>Imagine what a time sink that could turn into.",1239450466

This concentration of power has led to all sorts of power-crazed idiots getting involved to push their viewpoints and crowd out their opponents.<p>To add insult to injury they make all their money from providing eyeballs to advertisers leading to the same race to the bottom you see happening online.",1239449609

The size of X depends primarily on expected returns. That's how investing works. So if you assume that X is constant for any particular country, you're implying that returns are independent of how many good founders are available. I think that's not a reasonable assumption to make.",1239449214

If the US is able to attract successful startups the additional cost will be more than made up for in additional taxes.<p>Second, pg's proposal seems to be a more targeted version the of E-1/2 visa with the additional benefit of shifting some of the administrative burden onto the shoulders of investors. So it's probably less work for the INS than the existing E-1/2 process.<p>Sounds like a pretty good deal for the US tax payer.",1239448226

So would this be the result of voice training, or more just a side-effect of being surrounded by only men at work for twenty years? <p>I think it's more than just tone of voice and body language though. For example, while I have no doubt there are many college women who subscribe to the WSJ, I have yet to actually meet one. ",1191080282

And in true Web2.0 fashion, Usync allows you to vote on the best example. <p>Also, learning occurs in a series of steps, so, at Usynk, we start with the basic examples and move on to the more advanced ones as time passes by. Users decide what set of examples are relevant/informative for that particular step and users also decide when we are ready to move to the next step. The ones with maximum votes are selected as winner for that particular step. <p>What could be a better place than Hacker News to announce the site.Please contribute your code (which you agree to give away for free) and a demo.",1191079736

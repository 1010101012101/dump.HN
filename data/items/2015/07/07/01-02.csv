That&#x27;s not enough to generate a lot of variety on anything other than very common word combinations.  Strings of prepositions and articles are the most likely inflection points where you&#x27;ll commonly see two distinct phrases glued together.<p>If I get the whole strip run into the corpus, that&#x27;ll kick Calvin up to something more like 80-90K words, which will help with the variety a good bit, and the other characters will have more of a shot of current Calvin-like variety, but it&#x27;s still a relatively small training set.<p>By comparison I&#x27;ve done some markov model experiments based on multi-million word corpora and that gets a lot farther into the territory of regularly producing satisfyingly weird disjunctures.",1436234198
9843228,comment,9843190,9843190,0,0,DigitalSea,,,"I think the community have gone beyond the point where an apology from Ellen Pao will be sufficient enough to quell the dissatisfaction users have with Reddit. The only solution I can see is Pao stepping down or being replaced, followed by some actual management policies and ways of keeping the community happen (acknowledging them would be a good start).<p>The site has been on a downhill slope for a while now and as shown, this isn&#x27;t a localised incident, a lot of people are not only angry about the handling of Victoria&#x27;s dismissal, but how the site is being run. Why now? Why is Ellen Pao only apologising for years worth of mismanagement of Reddit after the community took a stand? This goes beyond what just happened, this has been a long time in the making. It comes across as a forced apology because before all of this blackout controversy, they were doing nothing. The community was being ignored, mods were running rampant shadowbanning and removing threads, mad with power. And ironically mods want better tools and more power? The promotion of krispykrackers just goes to show how out-of-touch Reddit has become with its users.<p>It&#x27;s great that they&#x27;re acknowledging there are issues and that they will do better, but I think it is too late. Maybe I am wrong, but I just can&#x27;t see things getting better or if they do, staying better for long. I have moved over to voat.co and when it comes back online, my 8 year old Reddit account will be nothing more than an effigy to a site that was once great. I personally have nothing against Ellen, the whole problem with Reddit goes well beyond her and members of the community also share in the blame. The centralised approach Reddit takes to management is its downfall and if they&#x27;re not careful, we could see what happened to Digg when they messed over power users happen to Reddit as well (evident by the influx of users over at voat.co).",1436234150

The results have just been published in PLOS ONE. This is the first study to examine data on the entire Jewish Polish population that immigrated to Israel before and after World War II, using the population-wide official database of the National Insurance Institute of Israel. &quot;Holocaust survivors not only suffered grave psychosocial trauma but also famine, malnutrition, and lack of hygienic and medical facilities, leading us to believe these damaged their later health and reduced life expectancy. Surprisingly, our findings teach us of the strength and resilience of the human spirit&quot;, said the leading professor of this research, Prof. Avi Sagi-Schwartz, from the Dept. of Psychology and the Head of the Center for the Study of Child Development at Haifa University.<p>...<p>One possible explanation for these findings might be the “Posttraumatic Growth” phenomenon, according to which the traumatic, life-threatening experiences Holocaust survivors had to face, which engendered high levels of psychological distress, could have also served as potential stimuli for developing personal and inter-personal skills, gaining new insights and a deeper meaning to life. All of these could have eventually contributed to the survivors’ longevity. “The results of this research give us hope and teach us quite a bit about the resilience of the human spirit when faced with brutal and traumatic events”, concluded Prof. Sagi-Schwartz.<p>Read more: <a href=""http://www.universityherald.com/articles/4078/20130731/male-holocaust-survivors-longer-life-expectancy.htm#ixzz3fAJRl2ut"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.universityherald.com/articles/4078/20130731/male-...</a>",1436233156

The monkeys in turn tolerate and largely ignore the wolves, although they take flight if they observe feral dogs, which sometimes prey on them. Within the troops, the wolves enjoy much higher success in capturing rodents than usual, perhaps because the monkeys&#x27; activities flush out the rodents, or because the presence of numerous larger animals makes it harder for rodents to spot a threat.[32]</i>&quot;<p>According to another website, in 2008 there was thought to be as few as 500 of the species remaining.<p>It is also well known that this species regurgitates food for the pups in order to supplement their supply of milk, and other females will assist in providing milk when necessary.<p>To me, this all adds up pretty clearly. A species about to go extinct, that primarily feeds on rodents, that uses other species to increase the likelihood of success of feeding, but still has trouble feeding itself. They adapt by forming an alliance (or at the very least being much less likely to attack).<p>This <i>could</i> be an example of how domestication formed, or, domestication could have developed from a completely separate process. The only thing that is clear is that this is an almost-extinct species that uses another species in order to improve its chances of eating.",1436231402

Modern art came about because of the rise of the bourgeoisie, meaning, people of different classes could commission works, artists had more freedom in what they chose to depict, sell, create, etc, instead of being limited to being commissioned by the church or by nobility.<p>But you are getting into a debate that hasn&#x27;t really been resolved in modern art either, this has been a debate in the concept of kitsch and collage, dada, Greenberg, photography, etc.<p>If you want to dance around the question linguistically, that&#x27;s all fine and good, but there are people in the world who believe that art must be sold and there are people in the world who find value in it other than the fact that it sells. You&#x27;ve got the past  and the contemporary interpretations of art conflated with the trends of culture. Plus, these circles weave and web together, people derive influence and inspiration from all sorts of places, art comes to mean different things depending on who is listening, who is speaking/painting/etc.<p>I mean, there is obviously either a rigid definition for Art which has no form in language and is thus inexpressible for all eternity despite the various shapes it may manifest as, or art is something else. No, just kidding, I have no idea what I&#x27;m patring on about.",1436230883

Sadly now they&#x27;ve taken to playing menacing background music during stories like when they interviewed some drug addict in Afghanistan who claimed to be ex Taliban and did everything including slowing down his laugh so it sounded as evil as possible. It&#x27;s bordering on propagandatainment lately.<p>There was also a questionable story by Vice about the Nigerian military fighting militants recently and the supposedly embedded reporter made zero mention that the entire crew in the attacking helicopters they filmed in were not Nigerian. Hey why do the gunners and pilots have white arms? Are they mercenaries? British pilots? South African? Who knows Vice never bothered to tell us.",1436230830

A program on the ABC called Q&A invited a person suspected of terrorism onto the program.  That in itself isn&#x27;t fascinating (at least to me).<p>The Australian Prime Minister has threatened one of the countries News Sources (ie. the ABC who aired the show), this includes a change of leadership of ABC - and as the ABC is government funded, almost certainly funding cuts.  The government has clearly threatened a media outlet - not for being prejudiced, but for allowing a view to be expressed.<p>It&#x27;s fascinating people think an interview between Stalin and Wells is a W-T-F.  What better way to understand differing views than to sit down and talk.  I really don&#x27;t understand the notion that suppressing an argument will make it go away.

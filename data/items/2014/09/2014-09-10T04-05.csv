8294998,comment,8287700,8289630,1,0,moca,,,"I have worked with Internet services for many years. I think we have missed quite some opportunity to build great web app platform.<p>For example, we could package web apps in .apk/.jar package, so they can run like native apps without worrying about missing a resource during offline. JS engine can have more freedom optimizing the code and cache the result.<p>There is no need to install web app like Chrome Web Store does. All we need is bookmarking and implicit app cache (with smart caching policy). Most people don&#x27;t use more than 100 apps on regular basis, so 1GB app cache is enough for most people. One major mistake with installable web apps like Chrome Web Store is they often come with security permissions, which defeats major value of web, security and privacy.<p>Offline can be done with smart API design. For example, browser can let web apps create cache files that sit next to cached .apk and share the same lifespan, then web apps can use sqlite to work with such files for storage. It is essentially the same model as Android/iOS native apps. All these can be done without any app install or security permission. The only risk would be you will lose data if an app is purged during offline, therefore it doesn&#x27;t have chance to sync the state back to server. If you really about data loss, browser can support pinned apps, so they never get purged by caching policy. That pretty much solves the fundamental problem with web app model.<p>PS: the usability of JavaScript, web APIs and performance are separate issues. That would also need to solved.",1410325179

8294989,comment,8292029,8294809,2,0,bane,,,"> Neither. For one, it&#x27;s obvious that any such products needs at least 1-2 years to design, manufacture prototypes, etc. Second, we&#x27;ve seen several previous exposes of how Apple developed new stuff (iPad was in the labs for 7-8 years, the iPhone the same, etc, and there have been galleries of the tons of prototypes they checked published). So, I was basically just stating the obvious.<p>Good, so then you must agree that Samsung couldn&#x27;t possibly have just slapped together a design and manufactured hundreds of thousands of watches in a few months. Even Samsung must take time to bring a product to market. If you truly believe Samsung just craps out devices, then you&#x27;re also claiming they&#x27;re among the most efficient design, production and marketing organizations on the planet. Nobody would even come close.<p>> Well, people already had a uncanillity similar experience to Android watches 5 or so years ago, by strapping an iPod mini to a wrist strap.<p>Can you link to what you&#x27;re talking about?<p>> It&#x27;s a watch that talks to a smartphone and has a computer screen, so of course its similar in that, but that&#x27;s inevitable.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s inevitable or obvious at all. Given the instructions &quot;go make a smart watch&quot; I can think of half a dozen completely different ideas right off the bat, none of which are what smart watches look like or how they work -- I never would have required tethering at all for example. I personally think cramming down the pinch and swipe smartphone metaphor into a device that size is not a good solution, I think all of the competitors (except pebble) failed in that respect.<p>It&#x27;s like if somebody told you to &quot;make me a device that will transport me distances using an engine&quot;. While you could have come up with anything from a boat to a train to rocket propelled rollerskates, instead you and your competitor both &quot;independently&quot; arrive at solutions which are basically different trim levels of this year&#x27;s Toyota Camry, except one has a stick shift.<p>Odds of that happening are close enough to zero to be effectively the same. So either Samsung has the best industrial espionage team on the planet (doubtful) or Apple just waited for the competition to jump first and then just followed the trendlines and produced a really polished as hell version of what they were fumbling around with (likely).<p>In fact, Apple could have copied and refined the Pebble instead and knocked it out of the park. By so blatantly copying what&#x27;s going on in Android land, it leads to too many unfavorable comparisons. They could have completely broken away from that path Samsung has set and gone with a smaller, sleeker, more elegant device. By refining the Samsung template, Apple just leads itself to comparisons, even if the final product is super polished. Basically, if Apple was going to make a car, they needed to make a Tesla or an Ariel Atom, not a top spec Camry (with a stick shift).<p>> The Samsung version is sub par in every way.<p>On this we can completely agree. I&#x27;m not impressed with the Android smart watches at all. I don&#x27;t see a good use for them, they&#x27;re overpriced, underspec&#x27;d and don&#x27;t provide me with anything I wouldn&#x27;t rather just do with my phone (and in fact require my phone to be nearby anyway).<p>That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m so disappointed with Apple&#x27;s offering, even though it&#x27;s just the Android watch polished to the n-th degree. In the end the whole direction is just a &quot;meh&quot; idea to me.<p>Imagine instead an Apple polish to a pebble style watch, no tethering required, all the watch faces and notifications and canned responses, week-long battery life, none of this swipe and nub nonsense, <i>beautiful</i> Apple design (Pebble watches all look like something I would have loved when I was 12, but not 40) and flawless execution.<p>Apple&#x27;s refinement of Samsung&#x27;s ideas aren&#x27;t even particularly tasteful. Imagine if the interface looked like this instead <a href=""http://www.theverge.com/2014/3/7/5477768/gabor-balogh-circular-smartwatch-concept"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theverge.com/2014/3/7/5477768/gabor-balogh-circul...</a> or this <a href=""https://dribbble.com/shots/1197072-My-iWatch-Concept-Overview"" rel=""nofollow"">https://dribbble.com/shots/1197072-My-iWatch-Concept-Overvie...</a><p>Or used a pixel qi display so you could use it equally well indoors or outdoors.<p>Or a long thin screen <a href=""http://www.tuvie.com/wp-content/uploads/nissan-nismo-smartwatch-concept2.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tuvie.com/wp-content/uploads/nissan-nismo-smartwa...</a><p>Or hell like the Samsung Gear Fit <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro1sRmxu4BM"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro1sRmxu4BM</a><p>What you&#x27;re failing to understand is that I&#x27;m not saying Apple copying Samsung is bad because they copied Samsung (who gets credit isn&#x27;t important), it&#x27;s bad because, given a possible universe of ideas they could have followed instead, they copied a crappy design idea and then polished that turd until it shined.

My sample size (5 or 6?) is small, but I&#x27;ve found the Waterloo folks to be solid.<p>Just to touch on some comments:<p>> 1) UoW has a really low requirement for entry, of my class many students went to study at UoW most of them had average to below average grade, compared to Oxbridge UoW has a joke of an entry requirement, I later learned they have a very high dropout rate after first year - which explains things, but I think is disingenuous to their students. School should be a place of learning not a lab for natural selection.<p>Getting solid results with weak students makes this all the more impressive.<p>> 4) UoW has really bad reputation in the academical world and ppl doing basic research ( look up UoW ranking )<p>This is very elitist.  Not everyone needs to graduate from a top tier research institution.  Many top liberal arts colleges are weak in research too.<p>> 6) Universities historically should have weak ties with industries. The reason for this is independence. I know for a fact that UoW has strong ties with microsoft in the past and used to push .NET stuff on their students ! how do you expect a university to be intellectually honest if they are attached to a corporation ?<p>Most professional schools have strong ties with industry.  Any senior partner at McKinsey (or Goldman) can get a meeting with the dean of any business school in America.  This is a technical program, not philosophy or art history.  Most engineering students welcome industry ties, and the job prospects that come with it.",1410324943

But the meat of the parser is in ./common/arg_parse.c, with the header for it in ./include/common/arg_parse.h. If you want to throw it into your own project you&#x27;ll want to take a quick look through the ./arg_parse.c and modify it to suit your project (The help text specifically is for my program, so you&#x27;ll want to rewrite the text in that part).<p>You can see an &#x27;example&#x27; usage in the same repo. The files listed below parse the arguments into a single struct with few flags inside, and also look for filenames in the arguments to load into the emulator:<p><pre><code>    ./cmips/args.c\n    ./cmips/args.h\n    ./cmips/args.x\n</code></pre>\n./cmips/args.x is a xmacro header. It mostly just contains the contents of the struct arg array for this program, but it&#x27;s also used to create enum entries which index the struct arg array. The &#x27;parse_args&#x27; function is fairly similar to what you&#x27;d do with getopt, just with the &#x27;arg_parser&#x27; function instead.<p>The argument parser code could probably be improved. Just looking back at it, it&#x27;s got a bit to much logic going on in that single function, it could probably be split up a bit.

I have spent a good deal of time this week researching what I could, but I can very well be wrong.<p>I&#x27;m not arguing that anyone, including Wesley, should have lost valid interests in the code they developed. Please consider the following scenarios:<p>1) Contributor was clear to license his contributions free end clear under the LGPL. They contributed them to a project that was a priori in violation of said license. If they were unaware of the conflicted project status and were led to believe it was valid LGPL, they should have sought correcting actions as a soon as they were made aware.<p>1.a) If they knew that contributing their code would directly create a violation of the LGPL, they shouldn&#x27;t have contributed. If they knew and did it anyway, they are party to violating the license.<p>2) Contributor code is encumbered and isn&#x27;t free to be licensed under the LGPL. Depending on circumstances, just because you type the keys doesn&#x27;t mean you&#x27;re completely clear of another entities interest in the work. In this case not only is the project encumbered but so is the contribution. It&#x27;s unknown what the validity of any license would be in this case.<p>A case could be made that the trigger to this recent mess, Wesley&#x27;s DMCA notice, is scenario #1. That the contributors were just recently made aware that the project they contributed to was violating the LGPL. They would be right to seek redress for the violation of the license. This is the process working like it&#x27;s supposed to.<p>It could also be that we&#x27;re seeing cases of #1.a (or if skeptical #2). Certain contributors weren&#x27;t just submitting patches to an email list. They were also the ones accepting pull requests to the main repo. It would stand to reason that they would be aware of the status of the main project. It&#x27;s a legal nightmare.<p>In _any_ of the three scenarios, the status of the project as a whole is still infringing. It&#x27;s so encumbered that it can&#x27;t be distributed and individual rights owners who are being violated should seek remedy. This doesn&#x27;t take the rights away from anyone. If they have found their rights to be violated, they should speak to an attorney.<p>Addedum to 1.a &quot;You can&#x27;t violate your own license.&quot; The contributor could have dual-licensed the code under the LGPL,  but then contributed it to the project under some other, unspecified license. That would be ok depending on the terms of the other license, but it&#x27;s not documented and impossible to verify. Also, we have contributors stating that their LGPL licensed code being violated, which discounts this possibility.",1410322904

Houses in the neighborhoods we were shopping regularly went for more than list, with competing bids. We finally found a house, at the very top of our price range, and put an offer in for it just a few hours after it first listed - for list price. The seller&#x27;s agent was furious! She really wanted to drag it out to the weekend and get a bidding war, which we absolutely could not afford. But what were they going to do... turn down a list price offer? Why not just sell it at a higher price, then?<p>We still have that house, 12 years later. It&#x27;s finally worth what we paid for it again. Sigh.",1410322364

Instead, as pointed out, the aura is granted to celebrities in all domains, appearing and leaving, and unlike Rembrandt, there&#x27;s no museum to view them 400 hours or years after fading from the scene.<p>The shame is there is no value to assign if a thing can&#x27;t persist.  How do we preserve our artifacts that will tell who we were to people 100 years from now?  Those living today can&#x27;t know what will be important, or called valuable, a century down the road, and we should not try to decide ahead of time because we can&#x27;t.<p>IOW our self-evaluation of contemporary culture is hampered by impossibility of seeing what is invisible.

Keynesianism has had control of the economy for the last 5 years atleast, and look at the result. Yet, you say it will work. I say it can only create bubbles. Bring on the attacks. 
And yes, I agree with matterhorn that government directed economic activity is essentially malinvestment. It is production that is important; most government activity has been focussed on spending/debt.
EDIT: No socialist controlled economy? Which world are you living in? India,my country has strict labour laws for about 85% of the businesses, including all in manufacturing, textiles etc. You cannot make a profit without offering workers a fair wage as decided by them & the GOVERNMENT first. Have you heard of autorickshaw pricing here? Who controls the prices? Customers? No, rickshaw unions, & the GOVERNMENT. So, all investment into autorickshaws, clean cars is distorted by these disincentives. That is one of about a million examples.
 The only place where there is no intervention (or less intervention) here is IT, which is why you see so much progress in IT. Have you been to Vietnam? Sri Lanka? I have, and I know business owners and I do know workers as well in these nations. No more ad hominems please.",1362369136

The fun part (gameplay, game balance, story-telling, level creation) all happen near the end. In fact, they happen so close to the end that games often don't finish. They will have one third great story, two thirds great levels, and the rest is just rushed and crap.<p>The reason for this is the tools we made -- game engine for rendering & AI, level editors, resource packers, art post processors, etc, this is how the game really is put together. You don't make a game, you make a series of tools that help other people (game designers, artists, writers, AI scriptors) make a game. Now it is a blast making a work of collaborative art -- because writing and art are awesome -- but making a tool for a game is VERY similar to making an office suite or a complex website. It is all just data and interfaces. All the same usability/complexity tradeoffs apply.<p>I guess what I'm saying is the author's attitude made sense to me, and I know for sure that I'm not not at risk for burnout -- I love this shit. I love making games, but really it is because I love to program. Stories and art and gameplay are all bonuses, but if I didn't love the code it would still be terrible. That makes me wonder if coding is for everyone. I would love for it to be, but I'm really not sure.<p>Lastly, I recently taught someone to code from the ground up and the biggest single lesson was this: You will spend most of your day not knowing the answer. You will think and think and wonder and wonder. Is there even an answer to find? Is rails just too slow or are my queries crap? Can the iOS animation engine handle what you are doing or did you just add too many quartz-level effects and that is why it is super slow? You won't know the answer, you will doubt yourself, but over time you will actually become comfortable with not knowing. And even then, you will still be surprised (and pleased) when you figure it out. It is unending and I think it takes a special someone to enjoy that sort of life.<p>tl;dr Changing your life isn't always the answer.

I don't think anyone would really argue that point.<p>There are, though, some questions that suggest themselves,  a few of which have even already appeared in this thread:<p>* Is there some kind of morality involved in electing not to work, if the option is available but not required?<p>* Do we want to work towards establishing a society where leisure is the default, guaranteed state?<p>* If we do want to work towards that state, what then does it mean to live a good life?<p>* If we don't want to work towards that state, what is our justification for inflicting toil upon future generations?<p>* If we manage to eliminate all non-creative jobs (stocking, cooking, manufacturing, etc.), what do we do with all those folks? Is it reasonable to ask them to retrain?<p>Some of the great questions of life, while perhaps not unsolvable, are neatly sidestepped in one's pursuit of the lower levels of Maslowe's hierarchy; being unable to make rent has more than once gotten me out of a funk caused by a girl, for example.<p>If leisure becomes the default (which job trends would tend to suggest), it becomes a lot harder to punt on these existential issues--you don't get the shelter of the daily grind or shitty retail job to protect you.",1362368431

(3 words)<p>Now, we can qualify bison(1), by stating that they are bullied by another group of bison, which I'll call bison(2). We can rewrite ""who are bullied by bison(2)"" as ""bison(2) bully"" (similar to rewriting ""food that is liked by me"" as ""food I like"")  so we get:<p>> Bison(1) who are bullied by bison(2) bully, bison(0).<p>> Buffalo(1) buffalo(2) buffalo buffalo buffalo(0). (5 words)<p>We can modify bison(2) in the same way we modified bison(1), by stating that they are bullied by yet another group of bison, called bison(3):<p>> Bison(1) bison(2) bison(3) bully bully bully bison(0).<p>> Buffalo(1) buffalo(2) buffalo(3) buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo(0). (7 words)<p>And so on...<p>> Buffalo(1) buffalo(2) buffalo(3) buffalo(4) buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo(0). (9 words)<p>> Buffalo(1) buffalo(2) buffalo(3) buffalo(4) buffalo(5) buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo(0). (11 words)<p>So that gives us sentences of lengths 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, ... words.  We can add a word to each sentence by just adding the qualifier ""Buffalo"" (meaning ""from the city of Buffalo"") before buffalo(0).  This gives us sentences of lengths 4, 6, 8, ...:<p>> Bison(1) bully bison(0) from the city of Buffalo.<p>> Buffalo(1) buffalo Buffalo buffalo(0).  (4 words)<p>> Buffalo(1) buffalo(2) buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo(0). (6 words)<p>> Buffalo(1) buffalo(2) buffalo(3) buffalo buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo(0).  (8 words)<p>So now we just need the sentences of lengths 1 and 2, which we can do by using the imperative.  I.e. we give the general instruction ""Bully."" or the more specific instruction ""Bully bison."":<p>> Buffalo. (1 word)<p>> Buffalo buffalo.

5316360,comment,5315815,5315815,3,0,graycat,,,"At least in the US, the history of rail and high speed rail is clear:  Even if you build it for free, during operations it fails (A) to show a profit or (B) to pass the laws on 'cost/benefit' analysis on the needed subsidies.  So, in simple terms, in the US, passenger trains are non-starters.<p>Or, at one time the US had one heck of a passenger train system:  Could get a train from tiny town A and travel to tiny town B for nearly any two tiny towns A and B in the country.  But as soon as the Model T came out, people rushed to buy them and use them in place of the trains, in spite of the fact that the roads were awful.<p>Since then the cars and roads have gotten much better.  For short trips, train technology is not much better than 100 years ago when it started losing out to the Model T and has no chance now.<p>For long trips, we have airplanes.<p>Look, we could have 'high speed' ships to cross the Atlantic, too.  And the last of the great Atlantic ships were fantastic.  Alas, people didn't like them, needed all the luxury just to put up with the uncomfortable aspects of travel by ship, and, really, were eager just to get where they were going.  So, when Boeing sold their 707 jets for crossing the Atlantic, the 707 jets quickly 'sunk' essentially all the passenger ships.<p>The Boeing 707 had some serious 'engineering-economic' advantages:  (A) It was much lighter than a ship, no doubt much lighter per person carried so that are moving much less dead weight across the Atlantic.  (B) It could make a round trip while a ship was at dock loading.  (C) Net, per month, a Boeing 707 could carry enough passengers across the Atlantic to compete with a ship, for less money and much less time per passenger.  That sank the ship.<p>For another detail, look at the map in the OP:  The trains go long distances, commonly across a whole state, without stopping.  E.g., in Tennessee, the trains stop in Nashville and Memphis, but between Memphis and Kentucky is about 100 miles that the trains bypass.  So, for all those people bypassed, how will the train serve them?  Yes, I saw the plan of a 'tram' that catches up with the high speed, non-stop train, 'couples up' side by side, does a transfer of people and baggage, 'decouples', and slows down.  Still I expect that mostly the plan would be that people in the 100 miles from Memphis to Kentucky would have to drive a car, ride a bus, or take a slow train to reach Memphis.  Now we are back to the old problems of handling luggage and making connections:  That's why the train terminals were so big -- to have space for people waiting for connecting trains.  Besides, passenger trains are vulnerable to Big Sis at the DHS and her TSA gang.  A lot of people would rather walk than face the TSA; to drive a car 1000 miles to avoid the TSA is a great pleasure.<p>Net, for short to medium distances, say, 1000 miles or less, just drive a car and, then, have all the luggage in the car during the trip, all under own control for the whole trip, and have the car at the destination.  For longer trips, take a plane as now.<p>Heck, there's a chance that modern blimps -- lighter than air craft -- could beat passenger trains.<p>Yes, I know:  Maybe there are some lawyers who want to live in Manhattan, have their offices near Grand Central, take a fast moving train to DC, take a cab to Capitol Hill for the day, and reverse the process and be home for dinner early in the evening.  Fine for people earning big bucks with an office near a train station and wanting to work at another office near another train station at most only a few hundred miles away.  Sorry 'bout those people.  For all the rest of us, we shouldn't pay subsidies for those few big bucks lawyers.  Besides, have they heard of video conferencing?<p>My main objection to passenger trains is that they want to use publicity efforts such as the OP to build political support to tax people to pay subsidies for the trains.  That is, the effort is to get into my checkbook.  No thanks.<p>If they want to build the trains with capital raised privately, fine with me.  If they wanted to proceed with private capital, then we wouldn't see publicity efforts such as the OP.",1362366788

Remember everything that is encrypted needs to be decrypted and depending on the complexity of the encryption algorithm being used, it could end up causing more problems than it would likely solve. I often forget my usernames for various services so being able to be sent my username without having to reset my password or anything is very helpful.<p>A properly built web application should throttle dictionary attacks out-of-the-box and safeguard against these kinds of common username and common password list attacks which are very inefficient. Plus, if the attack is originating via a login form you're not really protecting anyone because the username and password are being sent as plaintext to the server and would be encrypted anyway. Throttling and banning rapid login attempts is the only way to efficiently go in this instance.<p>The only benefit I could see is if someone were to gain access to your database and dump out all of the rows of your users table, then encrypted usernames might make sense (but still not in a way) because you'd most likely have identifiable unencrypted information still in the database like names, locations and email addresses. If you were to encrypt everything, you're crazy.<p>You would then run into problems if you were running a forum for example and wanted to show the usernames of users online or the username of someone who authored a thread.

However, the idea often proffered that you solve this by making people with jobs work less is silly. First, at the limit spreading the work around over more people still results in the same outcome. Second, it also assumes that the real problem is a shortage of jobs when the problem is actually a shortage of people capable of doing jobs where it makes economic sense to employ a person.<p>The problem is that we have a (figurative) glut of job openings for neurosurgeons and a severe shortage of neurosurgeons. The answer not to make the existing neurosurgeons work fewer hours; they are serving a valuable, irreplaceable (in an availability sense) function every hour they work. You can't give a lawyer, janitor, and accountant a crash course in neurosurgery, split the job between them, and expect a comparable result in the aggregate even though you created more jobs. At some point we will have to come to terms with the idea of decoupling a job from a decent life in the same way that jobs are being decoupled from economic growth.<p>The limit of this scenario is interesting as a hypothetical. When we get to the point where only 5% of the population is employable and they are all employed with very valuable skills that are in extremely short supply by definition, how are those people treated once the vast majority of the population depends on their continued work while 95% of the population no longer needs to work and is not usefully employable in any case? Can the 95% not working force the 5% to work long hours because there is a desperate need for their skills and talents which are not easily replaceable?

So the controller pattern makes a lot of sense there.<p>The author is spot on about how some architectural oddities like one-method-classes come from Java's lack of functions as first class objects.",1362366284

In the mainstream view, these labor efficiencies make goods cheaper, which leaves consumers with more disposable incomewhich they invest or spend on more stuff, leading to more hiring to fulfill demand. By contrast, the no-growthers would do things differently; they would use those efficiencies to shorten the workweek, so that most people would stay employed and bring home a reasonable salary. If new technology continued to drive productivity gains, citizens in a nongrowing economy would actually work less and less over time as they divvied up the shrinking workload.""",1362366231

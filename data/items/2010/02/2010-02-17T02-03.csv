Have a look at those posts. One from March 14th says outright that it's not being used as a blog:
DONT FOLLOW ME
I AM NOT A REAL TUMBLE BLOG<p>That guy has an active blog on Tumblr as Tumbledore. He clearly was using that account as an alternative dashboard, which is legit, but certainly doesn't need a special domain. I could see being put out a little bit about losing the domain, but his histrionic proclamations of oppression are a severe over-reaction. They have the smell of self-entitled internet personality.<p>I have little doubt that Tumblr exhibited more diligence in investigating this matter than was due Tumbledore for taking back a domain on their service. That domain a) had only been used as a convenience account, not for publishing anything, and b) that only in the distant past. Add to that c) it was occupying a subdomain that matches the trademark of another customer whom had requested it, and d) they gave him a reasonable opportunity to appeal. 72 hours does seem unnecessarily brief, but in this case it's immaterial.",1266375533

The majority of my friends are Catholic (well, ex-Catholics), and to hear them talk about church almost pains me.  I could not believe when they said people would show up at their door demanding tithes/money, some of the requirements for attending church, etc.  To be honest, hearing all about how Catholicism operates, I'd probably have been an ex-Catholic myself.<p>I'm a protestant Christian though, and the root of my belief has always been that we are ""justified by faith"" in the midst of our depraved, imperfect nature (see Romans 3:23-24 and Galatians 2:16).  My faith is not a set of demands that I am obligated to perform to get into Heaven, nor does it operate out of fear of Hell and punishment.  It's a faith that is rooted in a love for Christ, knowing that I can <i>never</i> do enough good deeds to justify myself before a perfect God.<p>When you know that by faith - simply believing - you are justified, clean, and in God's grace, there is no basis for fear.<p>It's an awesome concept, but if you were to examine the New Testament, you'd conclude that Christ didn't come to instill fear (or condemn) the world, but to save the world (John 3:17).<p>If you're really curious, check out ""Classic Christianity"" by Bob George or the latter parts of ""Mere Christianity"" by CS Lewis.

Blogs are full of windbags and echo-chamberism; after a certain point, you'll just waste your time reading them. I've kind of exhausted what I can read from my local Borders just sitting in the cafe, unfortunately, and it gets fairly expensive to buy niche stuff.<p>2. New languages, new application domains, new concepts. This could mean ""closer to the hardware,"" or ""further from the hardware."" They both have uses. I have a lengthy list of languages I want to get around to learning...but have no compelling immediate use for, which is a strong discouraging factor. Hence application domains - if you're doing coding for small embedded processors, you're forced down to a few language options. If you're doing web apps, another set of options. If you're doing compilers, a third set of options. Et cetera. Find the app that lets you learn the language.<p>3. Cycling between ""research"" coding(a tool, algorithm or data structure that might do something cool and useful) and ""production"" coding(bang out the app). If I did only the latter, I probably wouldn't learn anything! But the former lets me lay down a strategy for ""this time, I'll be more efficient by doing x...."" and then I try it and find out if x worked.<p>I would also note that commercial programming work is likely to limit your growth unless you're working at a hardcore tech company.

I've implemented mergesort several times, almost always expressed in terms of writing to/from pipes of data (that under the hood eventually wound up going to disk I/O in some way).  Those solutions will not suffer from any form of this bug for the simple reason that you never access anything by index.<p>The curious might wonder why I felt a need to implement such a well-known algorithm myself.  Well in addition to the times I did it for fun, one time I had a large dataset to process that had already broken the database, and the computer I had to process it with didn't have enough disk space for the whole dataset.

It's clear that ""the reason why I'm not using Lua,"" which is what I talked about, is not the same as a discussion of ""the reason why Lua isn't talked about.""<p>But I think I can weave my first comment into a comment on the second: The amount of discussion is dependent on the scale of useful projects. Bloggers, as a rule, try to fit everything into sound-bites. The big, complex projects where Lua gets used successfully are not easy to sound-bite, and the (hypothetical) average programmer can't relate to them; instead, blogs focus disproportionately on ""tiny code-snippet hack"" cases: take, for example, the ""reddit in n lines of foo"" meme. Those things are not particularly useful or informative, but they drive a lot of programmer traffic because they're just interesting enough to get attention without being difficult.<p>A project like Sqlite fits in great in the ""code-snippet"" case. It fills a certain application need - persistent storage and queries - and has lots of bindings so you can use it from most languages. It reuses well-known concepts from SQL databases, even if the actual implementation is different. So it's easy to talk about, and it's easy to include by default for a broad subset of projects.<p>Lua, being a ""full"" language, has some unique concepts and syntax, and an integration process requiring a little bit of thought and effort, which makes people feel uncomfortable. The benefits aren't immediately obvious. They'd need a bigger push to habitually include it in _most_ projects. So it fails the code-snippet test.<p>Rails is another good example. ""Look at how easy it is to get a useful webapp running!"" That was the original draw. It worked because, as it happened, when it came out, programmers were desperate for exactly that kind of solution. The people who bought into this soon generated additional waves of hype, because they realized that Ruby was more expressive than Java/C++/etc. that they had been using before, so you got a lot of ""Why Ruby is better than x"" follow-on posts from people who had never seen a dynamic-typed language in their life.<p>It is a case of ""stupid gimmicks,"" of course. Sqlite would still be useful without using SQL query syntax, and Ruby would still be useful without Rails, But I think that's the kind of thing Lua needs to gain hype. A Lua-based project that, within a specific application domain, makes it easy to create cool, useful hacks.<p>(L√ñVE seems like a pretty good example for this, honestly.)",1266372514

Therefore, ethical behavior is quite valuable, from wheresoever it comes.<p>It's true, there are some highly ethical religious people, and some highly dogmatic and unthinking atheists.",1266372055

On existential issues (the only legitimate grounds of disagreement between science and religion), Science and Religion are equal. They are equally uncertain, although many people can't understand that. Both have a mountain of faith-based assumptions about things we cannot EVER determine empirically.<p>Faith, after all, is being certain of what one cannot see.</i><p>By your argument you should personally be equally uncertain about whether gravity works on the surface of Pluto and whether I am a giant octopus.  After all you are unable to travel to Pluto, and you are unable to track me down and verify that it was not a giant octopus who wrote these words.  In your words, both are claims about things that you ""<i>cannot empirically experience</i> nor <i>empirically reproduce</i>.""<p>Yet despite your inability to empirically experience or empirically reproduce either gravity on Pluto or any data pertaining to my octopus-hood, I confidently assert that you do not find your uncertainty on those two issues to be even remotely equivalent.<p>Why not?  Because you have established mental models of how the universe work that make it difficult to believe that gravity doesn't work on Pluto and make it difficult to believe that there are giant octopuses posting on HN.  Yet this is exactly the type of certainty that you say you'd call BS on in others.  And if you met someone who strongly believed that I am a giant octopus, and expected you to accept it, I'm sure you'd be rather flabbergasted.<p>Science is nothing less or more than the distillation of the successes of several centuries of work on producing and testing better mental models of how parts of the universe exist.  Mental models exactly like the ones you used to tackle the data points I gave you.  (In fact every part of the mental model you'd use on the Pluto question, including belief in the existence of Pluto, came out of that scientific process.)<p>Please think about this example carefully.  Then try to apply modern mental models of the universe to questions such as whether people get possessed by demons, water can turn into wine, and people can come back from the dead.  You should find that those questions all look far more like the giant octopus claim than gravity on Pluto.<p>Whether or not this list of dubious factual claims in the Bible changes your belief system any, I think it is sufficient to make concrete why it is not just BS for people with a strong science background to look at a concrete religious tradition (Christianity in this case) and dispute specific claims that religion makes.  Even though it involves reasoning about events that you ""<i>cannot empirically experience</i> nor <i>empirically reproduce</i>"".<p>And once someone has disputed the basic facts of the central story, what grounds are left to accept the other beliefs of the religion?",1266372034

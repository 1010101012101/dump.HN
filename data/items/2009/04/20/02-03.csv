It is an opportunity to demonstrate both interest and competence.<p>My first job ever was as telephone order entry operator at a store that sold office supplies.  At one point in the interview the interviewer walked me to the floor, past the section that was doing drop shipping.  Then she started to explain to me what drop shipping was -- ""It is when we take the order on behalf of the supplier and then the supplier ships it from their location directly to the customer's door, without the merchandise entering our physical control at any point.""<p>I mentioned ""Well, strictly speaking, you don't deliver it to the door.  You deliver it to anywhere on the first floor or anywhere accessible by dolly if there is an elevator provided, for an extra charge of $35, with exceptions noted in the catalog.""<p>That got me some googly eyes.<p>""Its on your website.  I made it my business to know your business.""<p>As soon as I said that I realized that a) that was probably the best line I had ever delivered in my life and b) that job was <i>so</i> mine.  And it was.  There is a reason they put ""attention to detail"" in the solicitation.  (Incidentally, you can totally hack this.  Learn five interesting facts about the opposite party, and steer the conversation such that you're able to use one or two of them.  I certainly didn't memorize <i>everything</i> about the company prior to my job interview.)",1240196216

Sometimes it feels like you're just guessing how hard to shoot and other times it feels like you could throw anything up and you know you're going to get close.<p>I don't think people do a very good job and explaining why players object to these studies.<p>Because rightly or wrongly the player feels like at different moments there are different probabilities that they will make the shot based on all sorts of things. It's not just a fixed probability you carry with you at all times.<p>Using season averaged statistics is useful and tells one story but it does not tell this story because it can't be measured.

What I have in mind is a number that (1) nobody has influence over, (2) can be measured objectively, (3) is observable to everybody, and (4) is impossible to predict.<p>For example, I could tell my friend that I'll do his laundry for a month if Barack Obama's speech tomorrow contains an even number of words, and he'll do my laundry otherwise. This would appear to be truly random, but what if I secretly am friends with Barack Obama and can rig it in advance?<p>Is there some easy, practical way of producing a number whose randomness a large number of mutually distrustful parties can agree on?

The servers are big, hot, and not clockspeed competitive with tier-1 x86 hardware costing 1/10th the price.""<p>I find it interesting to see comparisons based on clock speed becoming common again. Different architectures behave differently and SPARC performs differenty (read ""better most of the time"") than x86 at the same clock. I thought people learned that from the PowerPC Macs. I find this supremely ironic coming from a person nicknamed ""iigs"".

570074,comment,569338,569874,0,0,olefoo,,,"Jails are actually very efficient, and well understood and have been tested extensively by the freebsd project. User Mode Linux or handbuilt chroot 'jails' under linux are less efficient (binaries have to be in the chroot and cannot be run from the host filesystem). User Mode Linux is effectively a kernel and userland running under a users UID; it's one of the least efficient forms of virtualisation. Both of these solutions would fall under the class of pseudo-virtualisation, since they depend on a host filesystem and processor, and usually it's less easy to partition memory and harder to guarantee process isolation.<p>Xen, VMWare and Parallels are all examples of para-virtualisation, where multiple OS's share the underlying hardware, but have their own resource limits in terms of disk and memory access. And the hypervisor exists to manage the timesharing and access control, but the guest OS's are executing directly on the hardware.<p>From a hosting company point of view, jails on a BSD system are the most tractable and resource efficient, followed closely by any of the paravirtualisation solutions. UML as a hosting solution is kind of cheesy (it's great for networking simulations though). From a customer standpoint, a paravirtualisation solution offers more flexibility and power.",1240194029

I've been stuck doing it ever since, because of my hacker mindset, but also because of the social scene. Imho, Swing is actually much better for hackers... plenty of women, it's full of other hackers, everyone's a bit geeky, and many folks are hyper-creative and artsy. It's also easy to learn but hard to master... lots of challenge when you get really into it.<p>I must note that the vast majority of people have many misconceptions about swing dancing. What you saw in the fad bears little resemblance to what's done today. No one really plays Cherry Poppin Daddies or other similar  pseudo-swing punk music. Lots of swing DJs are true music geeks, and play swing, soul, blues, and R&B at dances. Real swing dancing is much more about having feeling and jazz musicality than it is about acrobatics. Think of it as tap dancing with a partner. The acrobatics are definitely still around, but are basically restricted to performance. Yes, Swing is not as seductive as Salsa, but the emotion is definitely there.<p>Great example of what good swing looks like:\n<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3rlvBQ7nUE"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3rlvBQ7nUE</a>\n<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0u0YWCY0sZI"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0u0YWCY0sZI</a><p>In the Bay Area, check out:\n<a href=""http://920special.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://920special.com/</a>\n<a href=""http://www.redwoodcityswing.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.redwoodcityswing.com/</a><p>In Boston, check out:\n<a href=""http://www.havetodance.com/calendar.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.havetodance.com/calendar.html</a><p>In NYC, check out:\n<a href=""http://www.yehoodi.com/frimfram/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.yehoodi.com/frimfram/</a><p>There's also a very different family of dance in the swing umbrella, West Coast Swing: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_coast_swing"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_coast_swing</a>",1240193381

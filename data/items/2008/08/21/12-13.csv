282593,comment,281310,282508,0,0,yelsgib,,,"What does ""subjective"" mean? This question is not so straightforward as you (may) think. This is a microcosm of my point.<p>What is value? How do we determine the relative values of our life decisions descriptively? How do we do so prescriptively?<p>My claim is not that my understanding of the subjects is great - it's that your understanding of them (from what you've said in the comments) is shallow. Subjects do not exist independent of semantics - math and economics are only ""useful"" if we can transform our observations into their abstractions and vice versa (1 apple and 1 apple -> 1 + 1 = 2 -> 2 apples).<p>Philosophy can give us tools for performing those transformations. It's very difficult to say what is of value in life (is a family of value? food? shelter? what are their relative worths?) and so is correspondingly difficult to use our abstract tools (math, economics, game theory) on the components of our observation (money, time, etc.)<p>I'm not saying that chapter 23 is great, but I can motivate its use in -normal people's- lives. Normal people can't understand game theory, but that doesn't mean that they -should- or that they -need to- in order to survive or think about how they want to structure their lives.<p>My real point is just that it seems very arrogant to me to assert that some hack Yale professors ideas validate your ""prejudices"" re: philosophy. It's better to say honestly that you don't understand philosophy. Maybe you don't want to. That's fine. I don't care. My point is that you shouldn't rail against it if you don't understand it. No one cares about your personal preferences, so you conflate them with moral high-ground and assert them in a public sphere.<p>Good luck with everything :)",1219322705

282582,comment,282095,282494,0,0,aaronblohowiak,,,"I see your number one as reiterating what I was saying, not disagreeing.<p>A personal code of conduct is not ""a load of crap.""  It has a limited but useful role in framing and shaping behavior.  Like any system of guidance, it exists to provide the default and usual path. Each programming language culture has its own code of conduct, encouraging some behavior and discouraging other behavior, that stems from the culture's principals.  Of course, there are exceptions and we should be vigilant in knowing what justifies an exception.  However, just because there are exceptions does not mean that learning the code of conduct of a language is useless or that documents thereof are loads of crap.<p>What do you mean, ""you'll be a better person""?<p>I never said that refraining from swearing was a core principal, in fact it is far from a core principal.  I find cursing with abandon to be a petty indulgence and unbecoming.  However, being raised to appreciate why things are inappropriate is better than not passing along our cultural heritage of propriety and respect.<p>I understand that it is more popular to refrain from instilling a strong sense of what is appropriate and inappropriate in children these days because of the influences of moral relativism.  I believe this is a disservice and negligent parenting.  I do not presume that <i>my</i> sense of right and wrong should be the sense that others must accept. Nor do I believe that my views on what constitutes correct behavior at such a fine level of granularity as word choice make me superior to anyone else in any absolute sense.<p>Within the context of word choice, being more precise, informative and salient <i>is better</i> than talking about excrement, fornication or damnation.",1219321783

427873,comment,427740,427814,0,0,axod,,,"Yeah you may be right, I just couldn't work out how I'm supposed to use it... One finger, two thumbs, 2 fingers? With the iPhone i use 1 finger and can type pretty fast, but with the G1 it was just really hard to hit the right key, and you actually have to press pretty hard which slowed me down a lot.<p>How long did it take you to get used to it? Does it always take so much effort to register a keypress, or does that 'loosen up'.. :/",1231584877

427868,comment,427740,427769,0,0,swombat,,,"That's the feeling I got too. Criticising something as different as the iPhone keyboard (which I'm using to type this) when you haven't tried it is very unconvincing and possibly slightly dishonest both with yourself a d with your readers.",1231584207

They are A) profitable, B) run off Flickr, C) in a replicable space (e.g. not hard to copy), and D) still winning.<p>They win because they were first, and because they are cooler than the others.",1231584173

427865,comment,427740,427807,0,0,swombat,,,"The funny thing about the Apple iPhone keyboard, in that respect, is it actually does work just as well as a blackberry keyboard (and this is within the first week of usage...). I find that I can type just as fast on my iphone as I could on my blackberry.. In fact, I'm typing this on my iPhone, as it happens.<p>The iphone keyboard is a fantastic piece of design. I honestly believe that those who think of it as inferior just haven't tried using it for a few days. I actually think of the on-screen keyboard as one of the iPhone's key features, and the lack of it would discourage me from buying another phone.",1231583976
427864,comment,426859,426859,0,0,ahoyhere,,,"Palm has never been as cool as Apple.<p>Palm hardware has always been ""organization pr0n,"" which only appeals to a small subset.<p>The iPhone is seen as cool; it is the most desirable phone. People are bending over backwards to afford one (the most iPhone growth over the past 2 quarters has been in low-middle and low class income groups). Apple paved the way with iPods.<p>I think Palm will have a very hard time selling the Pre to people outside the geeky / careering groups where orgpr0n still appeals.<p>Even if the user experience is better, the market hasn't been conditioned fr it.",1231583906

427857,comment,427743,427743,0,0,trapper,,,"Off the top of my head things you could try:<p>1. Go to a paul chek, nasm or shirley sharman practitioner. They will check out your posture. Ignore anything they say about the one true way [edit - I mean the research is inconclusive - either may work, but all will claim their way is correct].<p>2. If you already have bad posture you need to correct it. Some good [alternative] ways:<p>- overhead lifting and overhead shrugs<p>- heavy front squat holds (just the hold, not the squat)<p>- go look at at mike robertson or gray cook for corrective exercises<p>3. If you haven't already tried, go to an ART practitioner. It's very sore but effective for a lot of people.",1231582963

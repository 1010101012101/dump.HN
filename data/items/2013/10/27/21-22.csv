It was printed with support material that peeled off a little too strongly, exfoliating the back surface. The orientation is kind of tricky as there&#x27;s a lip/groove interface between the front and back of the case which needs to be cosmetically clean to ensure a snug fit, so the only way to get that to work well is to print it with the back down, but there&#x27;s a &#x27;hood&#x27; over the ethernet connector that disallows printing directly onto the back.

Its very expensive for the cellular industry to increase capacity by building new towers.

Certainly we wouldn&#x27;t expect a large differential impact on share prices, and so only a small portion of Amazon&#x27;s excessive wealth can be explained by the Fed&#x27;s actions.<p>Furthermore, it&#x27;s very hard to separate the direct effect of low interest rates, from improvements in the economy in general.  You cite the current price of stocks as an example, but the Fed has had low interest rates since the financial crisis, so you to explain why now in particular is a bubble caused by low interest rates.<p>On the final point, I am correct about the mechanics of which stocks benefit the most.  Suppose instead of high risk stocks, low risk stocks, and bonds, we had apples, oranges and mandarins.<p>When the Fed buys lots of mandarins, it creates excessive demand for mandarins, and so the price increases.  This causes people who were buying mandarins to buy oranges and apples, instead but the total demand for mandarins has still risen.  We would expected the biggest price increases to be in mandarins, then oranges, and then apples.<p>Similarly the biggest price change is in the bond market (which the Fed effectively has complete control over), and then in low risk stocks, and then high risk stocks.<p>The effect you observe - people being driven from the low-risk to high risk markets by low interest rates - is ignoring the initial price increase that caused this shift.",1382910940

When it started out, it was an awful lot of fun. Of course, the paying customers got shafted every now and then, and after a while we began to take their complaints seriously. We began to feel as if we really were responsible for the successful, error-free perfect use of these machines. I don&#x27;t think we are. I think we&#x27;re responsible for stretching them, setting them off in new directions, and keeping fun in the house. I hope the field of computer science never loses its sense of fun.

The medieval european church forbade cousin marriage for centuries out to something like third cousin. This broke up the clans and arguably made cohesive western nations possible. Today in much of the non-western world first cousin marriage is still normal. I believe <i>most</i> arab marriages are to first cousins.

It wasn&#x27;t because at that time it was important to us that even monsters like Himmler - personally responsible for overseeing Holocaust, and actually coming up with the idea itself - were given a chance of defense in a trial. Because that was the decision made by the USA President (among other leaders) at that time at the Yalta Conference. You expected me to come on real terms with your cheap excuse?

And learn a bit about the Loser/Clueless/Sociopath theory of management - I ended up working for a bona fide sociopath, as it turned out...<p>I too quasi-capped my invoices on this hell of a project - I lowered my rate for certain types of tasks, given they were mostly data entry like stuff, so it seemed logical and at that point, I was psychologically mired in the whole thing.  Somehow this website I was hired to build turned into my being the entire IT staff for a enterprise B2B startup.  As in everything - sysadmin to QA to CTO.<p>I finally snapped out of it when a) the CEO lied to a customer about the data we were selling - blatant negotiation in bad faith and the customer was going to sue (and mostly definitely win) and B) it became apparent how they were playing 3 card monte with the invoices and lying to all the salesguys and me about cash flow issues while they paid off the loans their OTHER company had made to fund the startup.<p>So everyone working for this company quit.  It took us 6+ months to get paid back because the CEO&#x27;s wife then went and started pulling crap, reinterpreting contracts and claiming people were not owed so much money...<p>I too, like lots of contractors, have a commitment to the job and professionalism that you exhibited - I am certainly not faulting you for that.  But you have to realize some clients will consciously take advantage of that - read up on manipulative people and how to deal with them.  A good book is &quot;In Sheep&#x27;s Clothing&quot; by George Simon.<p>Then I suggest some deep soul searching / psychoanalysis to figure out what your blinds spots were and why - it was all a valuable lesson for me and I suppose it would have happened someday.  I can say it was ultimately useful. But 4 years of hell is a long time to waste.<p>So I hope you can find the silver lining in all this and I wish you luck.",1382909484
6623661,comment,6619776,6619776,1,0,avenger123,,,"First of all, the question you need to ask yourself is what type of leverage do you have in this situation and what type of relationship do you want to keep with this company you are at.<p>In terms of leverage, if you stop and quit right now, what will happen to the project? Are you on the critical path? This does give you some leverage.<p>Also, what level of documentation do you have with regards to getting paid? Based on your statements, you have met with management and have had verbal discussions. I would suggest doing these things via email. Do not just leave it to verbal communication for obvious reasons.<p>At this point, you need to build your case for yourself to prove that the company owes you money and you have not been paid. This is not so much that you would sue but that if you do go down that path you have evidence.<p>The next step would be to write an email to management stating:<p>1) The work you have done and how much you are owed. \n2) A deadline expecting to get paid (lets say a week). \n3) What will happen if the deadline is past and payment hasn&#x27;t been made.<p>Be prepared for a couple of scenarios in this case. The company ignores your email and the deadline is past. You need to walk away. How nasty do you want to be is also a considering. You can backup your work and remove it from source control and hold the company for ransom until you get paid (I know someone that did this and they got paid pretty quick). If you don&#x27;t want to go down that road, quit and look at suing the company with the expectation that you may not recover your wages.<p>The other scenario is that the company does pay you. In this case, take the money and find another job pronto. There is no reason to work for a company like this.<p>The other thing I want to add to this is that it is not your company and not your problem that the client is not paying the company. Don&#x27;t make it your problem.<p>The most important thing is that you need to stop working without getting paid. If you feel the company is going to screw you over, just quit and spend that time looking for another job. Your payback with the company can be that you spread the word in the area that they a deadbeat company and everyone should stay away.",1382909482

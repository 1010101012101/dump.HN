I think the writer was very sincere and it is true that advances in science via exploration can lead to many indirect improvements. Technology that may be developed to make, say, Mars more habitable could help on Earth as well. It is not because, as you say, he does not &quot;give a crap about starving children.&quot; The author notes correctly that much of the problem of starving children is political; it has to do with regimes and unstable governments. It is not simply there is not enough food or technology on Earth to feed children.<p>The world is more than is dreamt of in your web forum browsing.",1421809188

I&#x27;ve got a hickok machine that you look up the grid bias in the chart and can receive a reading in ... micromhos? Ok that implies conductance but that&#x27;s a strange unit.  I&#x27;m not sure these are &quot;instruments.&quot;<p>My treasure is a machine from soviet russia, it actually uses a signal generator to feed the grid, and measures transconductance in mA/V.  It&#x27;s got a bunch of power supplies, VTVM and microampere meter whose smallest scale resolves some nanoamperes, so I trust its methodology.  It&#x27;s nice to find the actual current passed by a rectifier tube instead of setting a meter bias knob to read out the &#x27;strength&#x27; on a unitless 0-100 scale.<p>But I never figured out how to intereperet the &quot;?&quot; on the emission testers.<p>My tube fap shrine won&#x27;t be complete until I get a Tek 575 though.",1421809169

Though of course, avoiding any single instance of exclusionary language likely would not be hard.)<p>I note that my way of approaching these sorts of things might be harmful, with all the extra qualifiers everywhere, and a few other things like that.\nHowever, I didn&#x27;t really feel comfortable not responding at all, because I felt accused of saying something that I felt I had not said, and which I did not understand how it might follow from what I had said.\nI hope that I have not engaged in moving any goalposts, or similar harmful rhetorical-ish stuff.\nHowever, I feel I might have done so (though I am not sure exactly where), so I apologize if I have.",1421809122

That we could\ndo anything with such a problem is a bit\namazing.<p>That we can apply non-linear optimization\nto a problem in discrete or combinatorial\noptimization, that is, 0-1, is curious,\nin this case powerful, and, thus,\ngenerally welcome.<p>That we are making good progress with\nLagrange multipliers without\ntaking any derivatives, e.g., as in\nthe Kuhn-Tucker conditions,\nis also\ncurious -- so, this is not your\nfather&#x27;s Lagrange multipliers.<p>And I proved Everett&#x27;s theorem:  That&#x27;s\na famous result, and quite useful,\nmuch more useful than difficult to prove,\nin\na wide range of resource allocation problems.\nAnd Everett is a famous guy, a physics\nPh.D. under J. Wheeler (one of the\nmain guys in relativity theory, in the world)\nat Princeton\nand the first guy to expound on the\n<i>many worlds</i> (parallel universes)\ninterpretation of quantum\nmechanics.  Everett thought that his\nresult was worth publishing, and what\nI wrote is more general and more powerful.<p>Simulated annealing is famous;\nthat some non-linear duality theory\nand Lagrangian relaxation totally blew\naway simulated annealing on an impressive\npractical problem should also be of\ninterest.<p>That it is possible to get better\nperformance using <i>central cutting planes</i>\nis actually not very well known.<p>Also I covered the mathematics\nin essentially full detail (everything\nimportant and not obvious, proved)\nstarting with next to nothing, \ngave a description of an <i>algorithm</i>\nthat is ready to code (it&#x27;s basically\njust what I did code from successfully)\nand also\nthe impressive computational experience,\nall in just that one post.<p>Simulated\nannealing is rarely described so\ncarefully, and it doesn&#x27;t provide bounds\non optimality, that is, we don&#x27;t know\nwhen to stop.<p>As I illustrated, my work\nprovides bounds which commonly in practice\nprovide a good stopping criterion.<p>Simulated annealing is sometimes regarded\nas part of computer science; well, my post\nshows something that sometimes is better\nand from applied mathematics.<p>Actually, the mathematics for such\noptimization problems is a well-developed\nand deep field; try to do much in\noptimization, and really should consider\nsome of the mathematics, e.g., what\nI posted.<p>Oh, by the way, my Ph.D. is in\nstochastic optimal control, and\nI&#x27;ve published peer-reviewed original\nresearch on non-linear optimization,\ne.g., some deep details about the\nKuhn-Tucker conditions.\nMy professors included some of the\nbest people in the world in optimization.\nThe Chair of my Ph.D. orals committee\nis a Member, US National Academy of\nEngineering and was a student of\nA.

The employee might be glaringly at fault, but if the employer does not follow process (or even fails to document that) then a ruling can go against them.<p>Claims are very common here; there are various law outfits which just specialise in this area (e.g. the 0800 SACKED toll free number).",1421808720

There is much fault to be found in Victorian values, but those values and Queen Victoria herself did much to free the British empire from rule by British despots.  Victoria&#x27;s rule, and the values she promulgated, paved the way for the Commonwealth of today. Even though Britain typically acted with rapacious greed in exploiting its colonies, somehow most of them achieved independence peacefully and, in most cases, are today better off than neighboring countries that were not a part of the empire. Victorian values are largely to thank for this implausible bit of history.",1421808711

Hours are my side of the bargain, and in return for hours I get paid cash.<p>I think its a form of dishonesty to gloss over this and wave your hands around and say hours don&#x27;t matter, just come in when you want and do your best and if you perform well you won&#x27;t be fired. When I hear this I think the employer doesn&#x27;t expect you to have anything else in your life other than your job, and that what they really want is _all_ your hours in exchange for your salary.<p>I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s necessarily bad, just say so and be upfront about it.<p>Having no holiday policy also artificially creates a grey area, or a point of conflict between an employee or employer. If I were a cynical old bastard I would suggest that the no holiday policy is actually so that holidays don&#x27;t accrue from year to year. In my experience young engineers don&#x27;t really take holidays and if you don&#x27;t force them out of the office they end up with months and months of leave saved up.",1421808120

As the tube ages, the cathode coating will wear out and emission will drop.  The cathode coating wears out through normal use the same way an incandescent lamp wears out: at normal temperatures, it will evaporate and get deposited somewhere else in the tube.  Emission testing is far from perfect, but it&#x27;s a good first test to figure out e.g. which tube is a dud.<p>I have a hard time caring because I never buy NOS tubes (same reason I don&#x27;t buy CA3280s).",1421807861

You should look at criminology more before making some of the crazy claims you&#x27;re making. Yes, more crime happens in urban environments; criminology is pretty clear on this. But what you originally did was point to a largely non-urban area and claim it as a counterpoint to places that have dense urban locations.<p><i>you have a 0.00001% chance of getting murdered in Italy and a 0.00005% chance of getting murdered in the US.</i><p>Presenting the statistics this way? Yes, you really do need to study criminology a bit more to understand why this is a bad way to present data. In Honduras, you have a 0.0009% chances of getting murdered (per year). Still sounds tiny, yet that country is the murder capital of the world and very much not safe to live in.<p>It&#x27;s also worth noting that I never said that crime was directly proportional to population.<p>Edit: the other side of the 0.00005% argument is: if you&#x27;re making the argument that it&#x27;s really rare to die from guns, then why bother with the &#x27;if only X had a gun&#x27; argument?

But you can probably expect the following:<p>1) You will need to boot a 3.8+ kernel, which is definitely possible but probably not available as a 10.04 package (unless someone has backported it).<p>2) Docker has a few userland dependencies as well. Most of them are extremely stable (tar, iptables, ip). But the lxc userland scripts have changed a lot in the last couple years. Docker is known to work with version 0.8, and that version might not be available in Ubuntu 10.04.<p>In short, I expect that docker will not work out of the box on a vanilla 10.04 system, but it can be made to work with a fairly small amount of customization.<p>If you&#x27;re interested in trying it out, feel free to join the #docker IRC channel on Freenode.

In addition to to being able to have multiple people each entirely responsible for a single lease, we (Australia) have a <i>very</i> generous &quot;student allowance&quot; scheme for most students. This guarantees us students a fortnightly income that is almost certainly at least whatever we would be paying in rent + utilities.<p>My situation is such an example. I live with three other students and one adorable puppy in an expensive city (Brisbane, Queensland - Numbeo.com estimates Brisbane&#x27;s living costs as ~87% of NYC&#x27;s). We live just ~5km or ~3 miles from either of the two local universities, and just above 2km or ~1.5 miles from the CBD. Rent is not cheap in our area.<p>Yet we had no insurmountable problems obtaining a lease. Rental applications are competitive in this area, so we did have to apply for <i>a lot</i> of leases - but credit concerns were never a problem. Despite being employed for maybe just 12 hours a week each, money is not in question - there are four people each entirely responsible for the rent who are guaranteed social benefits that amount to at least enough for their share.<p>Unemployed Australians also receive similar social benefits provided they keep applying for jobs.",1379116542

But that was not to be -- natural selection reacted to these new measures by choosing the tiny minority of bacteria that proved resistant to antibiotics, and we now face bacterial strains that are completely resistant to any available remedies (MRSA, tuberculosis and others).<p>In the same way, natural selection will react by these new measures by choosing the tiny minority of people that prove resistant to education and gender equality, and we will face human strains that are completely resistant to any available remedies.<p>In case anyone thinks this is some kind of veiled racist rant, I personally think the resistant strain will turn out to be white people of European descent. The reason? We can and do rationalize anything to ourselves -- for example, that environmental projects will save either us or the planet, in the face of uncontrolled population growth.<p>See, in the Population Paradox, it&#x27;s not the people who get it that are the problem -- it&#x27;s the people who don&#x27;t, who can&#x27;t, get it. And history proves that there&#x27;s no political solution that doesn&#x27;t turn out to be much worse than the problem itself.<p>&quot;We have met the enemy, and he is us.&quot; -- Pogo<p>More here: <a href=""http://arachnoid.com/evolution"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arachnoid.com/evolution</a>",1379116054

So in one patch you include an improvement to the allocator that has this obscure race condition but otherwise makes the allocator work much faster.  Then in another patch you increase the maximum size of the proc table (under the pretense of supporting some big-iron system that practically no one outside of some HPC centers own) so that filling it up will force a kernel page allocation.  So then you can force the exploit to occur on any system with both patches installed simply by allocating all the physical ram and then creating a ton of do-nothing processes that max out the proc table.<p>If you are an organization like the NSA you could even have the submissions come from what appear to be completely independent developers.<p>It is kind of the exploit version of &quot;parallel construction.&quot;  You know the exploit you want to put into the kernel, you just need to come up with reasonable sounding explanations for every little patch that ultimately gets you to the end goal.",1379115608

If you want to contribute to less air pollution: wear a jacket and a hat on cold days, and wear a thin t-shirt and shorts on warm ones; this is simple advice that will cause you to not keep messing with thermostats to feel comfortable, using less electricity and gas. In contrast, the &quot;simplest&quot; advice to &quot;use less fuel&quot; is going to cause you to sit there cold and sad while you try to force yourself to not mess with the thermostat; maybe you figure out the jacket thing, maybe you don&#x27;t: it wasn&#x27;t really useful advice, and it required willpower. If I want to burn more calories than I metabolize, I can either force myself to be hungry all the time (which might have negative ramifications), or I can eat foods that are more likely to provide bioavailable energy over longer periods of time that are less likely to turn rapidly into fat due to resulting insulin spikes: I will then be less hungry, and I will eat less without even realizing it <- that&#x27;s &quot;more complex&quot;, sure, but it is in another way &quot;much easier&quot;, as changing what you eat can be easier than insisting that you have to eat less and go without something your body is demanding.",1379114876

Part of the reason minimum wage jobs are so awful is if they weren&#x27;t, they would not be worth the money.<p>3) People think of minimum wage as a redistribution of wealth from evil corporate employers and rich consumers to the poor and needy. Notwithstanding who is evil and who is good, that is basically the effect. You can accomplish the same thing in a much simpler, market-friendly fashion: pay the poor for working. A minor version of this program exists--the earned income tax credit. It does the same thing as minimum wage--redistribution of wealth--without the overhead, without reducing workers&#x27; negotiating power, and without pricing new low-skill workers out. It can be done in a fashion that greatly reduces the welfare trap. For a while, this idea had broad bipartisan support, from Milton Friedman and Paul Krugman among others.<p>But now economists argue about minimum wage because it&#x27;s an attractive <i>political</i> issue. Famously, Paul Krugman&#x27;s opinion on minimum wage changes depending on who is president.<p>Bleh. Imagine if climate scientists or evolutionary biologists made political compromises. Worse yet, imagine if they started believing their own compromises.<p>4) Surveys are not of particularly high interest when it comes to discussing economics.

The web can serve up both types of data: document-based (e.g. Wikipedia) and application-based (e.g. Gmail). Being able to have a core toolchain of three inter-related languages that can communicate with each other that you can use as required should be the final goal. For instance, if you&#x27;re writing a web application, you could only use CSS/JS, and if you needed to write a very simple blog, you could use all three, or just HTML and CSS.<p>Having more options never hurt anyone. Better JIT of JavaScript code would break pure JS open, allowing full apps to be written without language fragmentation. Those who will still require stylesheets can use them as they wish.

I didn&#x27;t say that CPM ads don&#x27;t work; I said that CPM ads don&#x27;t work <i>on websites</i>. They work in non-interactive media, because you are focused on <i>looking</i>, instead of on <i>interacting</i>. Your brain isn&#x27;t put into an active <i>searching/hunting/gathering</i> tunnel-vision mode. You aren&#x27;t thinking &quot;is this paragraph worth tweeting.&quot; You&#x27;re just passively consuming, and so your passive consumption can be paused to deliver a word from our sponsor.<p>> The best ads work when you don&#x27;t even realize they are an advertisement.<p>To me, Reddit&#x27;s ads are excellent because they are precisely the opposite of that: they are clearly ads, they clearly sell me something, I can clearly tell what it is, it&#x27;s definitely something I want, and if I click it, I know I&#x27;ll get it, quickly and cleanly. And <i>because</i> all those things are true, the ads can afford to be subtle and pretty, instead of harsh and eyecatching. Sometimes it&#x27;s just a link to another subreddit, and what they&#x27;re &quot;selling&quot; is more (loss-leading) free membership. Sometimes it&#x27;s something that costs money. It&#x27;s always something relevant.<p>And the thing is, CPC ads usually <i>are</i> relevant, because it&#x27;s very easy to tell <i>as the site-owner</i> when they&#x27;re &quot;working&quot; on a page, and to split-test different ad-providers to find out whose ads get clicked <i>more</i> (and thereby find out what ads people actually enjoy clicking.) In fact, you have to do this with CPC ads--because irrelevant ads won&#x27;t get clicked, and so you won&#x27;t be making any money! This doesn&#x27;t apply to CPM ads, and so CPM ads are generally irrelevant; there&#x27;s no feedback loop in place to <i>make</i> them relevant. They&#x27;re not <i>incentivized</i> to be relevant. And yes, if I could, I&#x27;d block them as a &quot;revenue source for websites&quot;--because without the (stupid) option of CPM, advertisers would just switch to offering CPC all the time (it&#x27;s not like they want to suddenly lose 90% of their placements and go out of business either), and the quality of ads on the internet would improve <i>immesurably</i>.<p>And, <i>having done that</i>, advertising on the Internet becomes as simple as &quot;Do you click on ads? Here are some ads, then.&quot; The incentives of that make <i>everyone</i> -- the user, the site-owner, and the advertiser -- much happier.<p>(And no, I&#x27;m not using &quot;CPM&quot; to also refer to <i>brand-associated sponsorship/PR</i> like HN; that&#x27;s fine, and works everywhere, because it works gradually instead of needing to hook you away from the content you&#x27;re consuming. Instead, I&#x27;m using CPM to refer specifically to creatives that <i>could</i> be CPC, but aren&#x27;t. Those, and those only, are what create the misaligned incentives for sites to run horrible ads their users have absolutely no interest in.)",1379113468

They don't have access to state funds, or any government programs that only work through states (though many government programs working through states do make a point of including DC, not all do).  Also, they lose out on a lot of corruption not having senators at all.  Senators regularly ship large amount of pork back to their state.  No senators, no pork.<p>A large city in your average state can get away with a lot more corruption and mismanagement than DC could.  They'd have state government, certain national programs, and national representatives to fall back on.  DC gets none of that.",1262620586

1030495,comment,1030290,1030392,0,0,patio11,,,"Thomas is the security consultant, I sell bingo cards to 60 year old women, take with appropriate grains of salt: the timing attack is impractical against almost all Django installations, and is difficult to exploit Internet-wide in an automated fashion (like, e.g., you can do for Wordpress vulnerabilities).<p>However, the impact is probably <i>severe</i> if your installation is vulnerable (i.e. if the bad guy can get sufficiently local access to your site over the network, and if you allow him sufficient rejected attempts).  This can happen in plausible circumstances.  For example, if you host on Slicehost and the bad guy is sufficiently motivated to pay $20 a month and buy himself a slice in your data center, congratulations, it is highly likely you are vulnerable to timing attacks in this manner.  (This vulnerability is by no means unique to Slicehost, I'm just using this as a practical example of how a dedicated adversary can plausibly exploit a common deployment scenario.)<p>If you're vulnerable, the bad guy can compromise signatures given a long enough time.  I am not a Django guy but I am a Rails guy, and one common pattern we have is to store things in the session where the session is serialized into the cookie.  For example, we might store the authenticated user_id there.  (I do.)  The signing is what keeps someone from swapping out user_id = 12387 (their freebie account) for user_id = 1 (my all-powerful admin account) and convincing the system that the user logged into their browser is me.  If you can forge a signature, free admin for you.<p>Given that this vulnerability has catastrophic consequences for vulnerable users and you probably encourage coding practices which make users vulnerable to it, I'd put it pretty high on my list of things to fix prior to release.  But again, I am not the security guy.",1262620436

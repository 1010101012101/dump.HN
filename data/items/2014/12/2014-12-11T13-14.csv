You can even offer it via a contract where people are permitted to do some things with it and not others.

If you want something that behaves like modern copyright, then you can sell copies of your work with appropriate contracts.

So, my guess is that OS X (host) doesn&#x27;t know anything about whether what is being written on the VM is a small file or not. There are two possibilities: 1) either the OS X activity monitor is actually measuring disk+cache when it says &quot;disk writes&quot; or 2) disk writes really are happening as fast as shown in the graphs. My bet is the later. What saves things here is the usage of the RAM disk on the guest, since at least that is a clean mechanism for really only using RAM instead of disk - and that carries through from the guest to the host.",1418306042

Putting in effort does not equate &quot;getting compensated&quot; and it should not.<p>If they can&#x27;t find a way to be compensated, they should find other work to do. Just as if I can disrupt an industry with some new cool gimmick, and thus put potentially thousands, if not millions of people out of work, why shouldn&#x27;t I? Why should we play protectionism?<p>Why should we try to build things like DRM just to protect something which itself has little to no intristic value? As if we acknowledged that yes -- &quot;the industry is vulnerable in this new world we live in, but actually adapting to the reality would mean billions, if not trillions of lost revenue, we should rather fight tooth and nail to <i>protect</i> it.&quot; I see no sense in this.<p>Yes, it is a race to the bottom. In the end it just means that goods and monetary compensation gets distributed differently. Obviously, those who right now benefit from the said compensation fight tooth and nail to keep their position, but as I do not -- and I say this as a person who spends considerable amount of money on actual physical CDs (along with misc. merchandise) still, most of which I do download illegally before bying and will keep doing so -- I see this as counterproductive.<p>I suppose some people see this first and foremost as an argument about whether or not one should get compensated for the work they do or not.

Perhaps you were considering some sort of FCIQMC approximation to the path integral, but it&#x27;s not entirely obvious to me how this would work.<p>As for how DFT would work for this... It should work quite well for qualitative predictions. Actually, DFT does remarkably well for metals and functionals like asymptotically corrected PBE0 are providing remarkable physical insight. While I wouldn&#x27;t trust the numbers that come from any DFT simulation to three decimal points, I&#x27;d certainly trust the physics that&#x27;s captured.<p>That being said, metallic hydrogen should be a strongly multireference system, so I&#x27;d be interested in seeing how a green&#x27;s function approach based in many-body perturbation theory (see GF2 from Zgid at U Michigan) would do, as it doesn&#x27;t struggle with issues of references while still giving you coupled cluster level accuracy.",1418305932

Rust is effectively all the tools and best practices of C++11, except without the burden of twenty years of backwards compability (not to mention the albatross of being an almost-but-not-quite superset of C), and as a result it can design the entire language around these best practices and optimize them for ergonomics (Rust&#x27;s boxed pointer is much easier to use than std::unique_ptr, especially since Rust defaults to move semantics), for safety (Rust&#x27;s borrowed references are amazing when all you&#x27;re used to is the use-after-free-for-all that is C++ references), and for speed (Rust&#x27;s Rc smart pointer is faster than C++&#x27;s std::shared_ptr, because knowledge of ownership allows Rust to <i>safely</i> use non-atomic operations to bump the refcount).",1418305784

New musicians (i.e. people who haven&#x27;t really played an instrument before) can jump directly into playing notes and chords in a way that far less intimidating than most physical instruments, but still build intuition around chord types, pitches, harmonies, relationships, etc.. It&#x27;s a foot in the door to no longer feeling like making music is beyond you, and encourages you to play/enjoy the process. When you hit the app&#x27;s limits of griddedness, that&#x27;s when you take that intuition and excitement to other instruments.<p>2. Proficient/comfortable musicians can pick up Fiddlewax Blue to create new sounds and progressions than they would otherwise explore on their main instrument. For example, a lot of people play the guitar, but spend so much time learning a few chords that they can feel boxed in. When you have a larger palette of chords and scales, you can find new melodies and riffs, then translate those back to your main instrument.",1418305630

It&#x27;s not as if the poor would be without transport even if only Uber was available. Let&#x27;s allow private companies to provide what transportation they can. The existence of these companies does not stop the city from offering alternative solutions for various market segments, or offering a subsidy to entice companies to meet those needs.</i><p>The presence of unliscensed (as a livery service) operators in a city has two possible negative effects on the transport options for the community.<p>1. The &quot;creaming off&quot; of some high-value trips makes it less economical to have cars in the area to serve other needs (like bringing groceries home from the supermarket with good selection and low prices rather than buying all food from a corner bodega).<p>2. It&#x27;s well and good to suggest that the city step in to provide subsidized transportation (directly or via an agent), but without the licensing and taxation revenue, that money now has to come from general funds whereas, before Uber, it was provided without hitting the general funds of the city.<p>3. There is a public good provided by &quot;must transport&quot; laws that most livery services operate under. That relates to #1, so I won&#x27;t call it a third point.<p>For the record, I agree with you that the current taxi system is antiquated and if we were to design an idealized system from scratch, it might look closer to Uber/Lyft than the current system, but I don&#x27;t agree with &quot;screw the laws; they&#x27;re stupid anyway, so let Uber do whatever they want&quot; approach that many pro-Uber advocates seem to advance (of course, not in so many words).",1418305624

No, not really - that C code has to be really vetted, just like unsafe code in Rust has to be really vetted.<p>I guess we might - eventually - be able to formally verify a language implementation, thus really <i>proving</i> that a language is safe (that goes for those managed languages, too).

Alternatively, you can use the ATS language, where you can <i>prove</i> that unsafe usage of pointers etc. really is being used in a safe way.<p>> You can&#x27;t isolate unsafe memory access.<p>Sure you can - owned and borrowed pointers in Rust are represented as raw pointers at runtime.

The enthalpy differences between phases are so small that changes of only a few meV per proton can make a noticeable difference to the phase diagram<p>so that&#x27;s some physics.

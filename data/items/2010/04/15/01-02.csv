But the gist of the rant is that he keeps doing the same repetitive, mundane tasks over and over again, merely to shuffle data from one part of the system to another and convert between representations on the way.<p>Like when you have a database, a server application and an AJAX web page, you may have four to five different representations of the same data (DB table, server language object, JSON, Javascript object and finally HTML) and need a whole bunch of code just to move data from A to B and convert between representations.<p>It's not just a language problem. It's just as much a problem of impedance mismatch between different systems, protocols and data formats. Various frameworks attempt to reduce the tediousness, but tend to come with issues of their own.<p>PG has something on this too:<p>""Of course the ultimate in brevity is to have the program already written for you, and merely to call it. And this brings us to what I think will be an increasingly important feature of programming languages: library functions.""<p>""I think a lot of the advances that happen in programming languages in the next fifty years will have to do with library functions. I think future programming languages will have libraries that are as carefully designed as the core language.""<p><a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/popular.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/popular.html</a><p>Whether the common case is made simple by the language, libraries, frameworks or standardization (we may need all of them) ultimately does not matter much to the developer, only that you can handle conceptually trivial everyday tasks with the minimum of fuss.<p>We have a long way to go before this becomes a reality.",1271296582

1266715,comment,1266627,1266627,0,0,jasonlbaptiste,,,"This makes a ton of sense and finding an organic idea is often what I tell people to do when they're thinking about a startup.  Few reasons:<p>- Doing a startup is like an iron man competition.  When there's something you want to see built, there's that extra incentive to keep going.  If you don't finish, you don't get the thing that you wanted.  Steve Jobs said it best in his interview at D5 with BillG.  Any sane person would give up, but if you really want to see what you're building exist in the world, you'll keep going.<p>- Usually the organic idea stems from some kind of domain expertise ie- If you used to work in the fashion sector, you recognize severely broken things that are amazingly obvious from spending so much time there.  If you didn't work in the Fashion industry you would have no clue these things exist.<p>- You'll be able to find co-founders more easily.  If you've spent time in a certain sector with a problem you're trying to solve, odds are a) you know people in that space really well b) they therefore know that vertical well c) they will recognize the problem as well.<p>Don't make something people want, but make something you want.  Odds are there will be a good amount of other people like you out there.  My first startup was a non organic idea.  We were trying to make SaaS for PR professionals because it seemed like a good opportunity.  Honest truth? I was never a PR professional and didn't really give two shits if PR professionals had good software.  I could live if that itch wasn't scratched.  Ironically, this failure spawned what is an Organic startup that i'm currently working on with Cloudomatic by helping SaaS developers get distribution.  Life works in funny ways.",1271296447

Because India has it own reactor tech, it has a stronger hand when negotiating with GE/France/Russia to buy reactors. For instance, they can ask for technology transfer and license to manufacture too instead of just a reactor.<p>So Ogg Theora wins even if it dies, because it kept the Free video codec idea alive until a big backer such as Google emerged for the idea.<p>Thanks for all the work, Ogg!",1271295903

Learn one small thing at a time and build upon it, you will be amazed at how much more productive and quick you will become from understanding simple commands.<p>- Start using Vim/Emacs. Doesn't really matter which one, the gains from using a powerful editor will (in the long run) pay for them selves.<p>These editors combined with the command line have shown the greatest gains in my productivity.<p>Now that said learning the editor will be up hill for a good chunk of the time until it clicks, so it may make sense to use something like geddit in the mean time.<p>There is no magic bullet with any sort of Development.

1266701,comment,1266575,1266670,0,0,bphogan,,,"Honestly I think there are many benefits to Linux especially if your plan is to work on Python or Ruby development. If you're looking to do C# stuff, Windows is gonna be better. When it comes to a lot of open-source languages, Windows is kind of an afterthought, and while it often works, the non-Windows solutions end up being faster, and more likely what you see when you deploy your apps. It can help greatly if your dev platform mimicks your production platform, but it's not necessary.<p>I just taught a day long Ruby / Rails class in Feb and we had Windows users mostly, with some Mac and Linux folks too, but we all deployed to Heroku.com without issues.<p>My advice is to use what makes you productive now. Learn many things, but learn them one at a time or you'll frustrate yourself. Switch from Windows to Linux when Windows starts slowing you down if that makes you more comfortable.<p>Programming should be fun. :)",1271295761

I'm not exaggerating; after spending the past year or so developing on Ubuntu, I don't know how I managed to get <i>anything</i> done before.<p>The Windows command line is minimally usable (I have to right-click on the window frame to pull up a context menu that provides select/copy/paste functionality?

SSH requires a clunky third-party tool like PuTTY or a Posix emulator like Cygwin.<p>Native support for open source database servers like MySQL, Postgres, and SQLite is dodgy at best and requires bolted-on interfaces. More exotic, innovative database systems are generally out of the question altogether.<p>Some programming languages, like Python, are reasonably cross-platform (though in the case of Python you're still stuck with a choice between using the crappy Windows command line or the slightly-less-crappy IDLE IDE built in non-native Tkinter), while others are much harder to get working.<p>Java is fully cross-platform and has IDEs that work as well on Windows as any platform, but there's no particular reason to develop Java on Windows rather than another OS.<p>It's true that installing Cygwin makes a lot of the deficiencies of Windows go away - but that's by emulating a Posix environment such as you'd find natively on Linux or OSX, which is kind of the point about Posix being generally a much better platform for programming than Windows.",1271295100

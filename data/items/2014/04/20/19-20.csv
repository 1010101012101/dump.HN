There&#x27;s very little to get excited about and very little to get annoyed about.  It really does just work.

7618245,comment,7616910,7617154,1,0,akg_67,,,"NASUNI <a href=""http://www.nasuni.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nasuni.com</a> started out with the same idea but now has become much bigger focused on enterprise market. As a Storage Product Manager managing a Storage Virtualization software product over a decade ago, I researched this idea. Also, my first startup was addressing similar problem - consolidation of unused storage space within a geographically dispersed enterprise. Both happened before &quot;cloud&quot; term became popular and S3 wasn&#x27;t even a service.<p>Technically, it is a difficult problem to solve if the product need to be software based, simple, transparent and targeted at consumer market so that user can install on their laptops/workstations. The product will need to sit in the middle and capture every operation between OS and DropBox, GDrive, and OneDrive etc. It is not a trivial problem to solve.<p>A solution that uses a target storage device on a network which in the background sync with different online storage service providers is a better alternative and that is what NASUNI and a few others pursued. But now you are in consumer/SMB storage hardware business. Another better solution option is for users to only install one piece of software (ex: OwnCloud) which uploads to one cloud and then sync with other services in the background. Overall, my impression is that online storage providers offer very little support for such services that try to consolidate storage from different service providers.<p>On business side, it will be very difficult to make money of people who want to consolidate &quot;free&quot; space from different services. Such people are inherently cheap and wouldn&#x27;t pay for your service either. So this will lead you to target SMB/enterprise market where typical mindset is to use one service like S3, Box, or Dropbox. So your value proposition has to change from distributed and large online storage system to redundancy, disaster recover, data access and data protection. Such solutions still have the single point of failure - your service. You will need to somehow need to be overcome.<p>Overall, I believe it is a good idea in principle, figuring out a business model, distribution and customer discovery may be a larger challenge.",1398023493

If you move the origin slightly closer to that station, it then figures correctly.<p>At any rate, with Google you can tell it to favour fewer transfers, Citymapper has no such option as far as I can see.<p>[1] <a href=""http://bit.ly/RC5tO5"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/RC5tO5</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://bit.ly/1hfqEu3"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/1hfqEu3</a>",1398023290

And the &quot;tens of thousands of years&quot; is grossly overstated, at least if you apply the metric that after 600 years it&#x27;ll be no more radioactive than the ore from which it was mined.<p>The Chernobyl RBMK design is criminal, and literally so in the US, where Edward Teller made sure reactors with positive void coefficients were outlawed (one reason we don&#x27;t do CANDU, although the proposed Advanced CANDU reactor addresses this).

And revenue sharing is a possibility? Also, the percentages seem very low. What are the investments typically like?<p>On the UK version, investments are usually something like £80,000 for 30% of the business. Often it ends up with two of the Dragons sharing the investment. Candidates say they are looking for £X for Y%, and they are only allowed to take the offer if they get the full amount, but it often ends up coming at a much higher percentage share.<p>One thing that has been pointed out several times in UK media however is the number of contracts that fall through, and actually the often poor support that those who get funded receive from the Dragons.

When I got engaged, put it on the left hand with the pointing out (to show that I was engaged). When we got married, it pointed in.  We spent $50 to replace the glass center with a synthetic emerald. I get more questions and comments on it than a diamond would (questions about culture, symbolism, etc). I personally don&#x27;t like diamonds for various reasons, neither does my sister who got a blue sapphire or something like that. So I agree, women don&#x27;t care as much about diamonds.  Some want them since they are culturally programmed to, some like the storybook feeling of having a diamond, some get diamonds since that is what the men think they want.",1398022932

When Stalin was speaking, there were people actually dying of starvation, millions of severely undernourished people, and huge structural problems with food production. In the UK today, most people have copious amounts of food, a lot actually goes to <i>waste</i> every day, and while some people might find it hard to put food on the table, it&#x27;s within the means of private charity to help them without the government having to intervene. The reported increase in the problem seems a bit dubious to me, e.g. here is an actual food bank founder speaking:<p><i>Consider again the views of Robin Aitken of the Oxford Food Bank, a former BBC journalist who now collects unsold fresh food from supermarkets and distributes them to charities in Oxford. He says: ‘Some people like to believe that there has been this enormous upsurge in food poverty. My point is that there have always been poor people in this country. You could have gone back ten, 20, 50 years and there would be people who don’t get enough food. ‘The fact is that food banks are a new phenomenon. Now we have got up to 500. If you provide a service, people use it.’ Significantly, he believes that people suffered greater hardship in the recessions of the Seventies and Eighties than today, when food banks didn’t exist.</i>",1398021864

Any sort of mathematical modeling you do is going to involve linear algebra at some point.<p>I have argued that almost all numerical mathematics, in some form, can be modeled as a linear algebra problem. Google&#x27;s original page rank algorithm is linear algebra. Remember that Netflix challenge? All linear algebra. Optimisation? Linear algebra. Want to do any engineering of a system? Behind the scenes it is all linear algebra as every single numerical technique for solving PDEs, that I am aware of, can be thought of in a linear algebra sense. Fluid modeling is all linear algebra. A lot of the machine learning I&#x27;ve seen is just linear algebra. I would also that almost every simulation running on the world&#x27;s supercomputers involves linear algebra.<p>Do you absolutely need linear algebra to do this things? No. Just like I don&#x27;t need to understand how my car works to drive it. But having an understanding how these systems operate can really help you use them in a more logical way.",1398021217

Find a problem that requires the mathematics you want to learn, and learn it with the persistent contextual understanding that you are trying to do something more than just tinker with definitions. Do this for one application and repeat as desired.<p>My view is that when this is done, you learn to focus on the things that matter over the things that are used to fill empty space in courses (calculus courses come to mind as a specifically abhorrent example of this). You get better at seeing the forest over the trees.<p>The problem is this avoids the OP&#x27;s question (and this ensuing discussion about the OP&#x27;s questions and the purported answers), since you can&#x27;t organize a single class around it.

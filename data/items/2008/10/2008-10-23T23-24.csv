It describes how the two opposing forces, socialism and capitalism, battle it our on the world scene, and how the pendulum swings back and forth between the two.<p>It is made by PBS, and has a homepage here: <a href=""http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/commandingheights/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/commandingheights/</a><p>As far as I can tell it does not try to depict one ideology as better than the other, merely to explain these ideas, and how they have shaped the world. The six hours of video will take you through the rise and fall of fascism, the fall of the soviet union, the depression of the 70's, the Asian meltdown in the 90's and much more. And most importantly: It will give an excellent insight into why these things happened, what economic and ideological ideas lay behind, what it meant for the world economy, and how it is all intertwined. In short it describes why globalisation and world economy is as it is today.<p>It has interviews with Gorbachew, Bill Clinton, Milton Friedmann, Lech Walesa, Friedrich Hayek,  Margaret Thatcher, Jeffrey Sachs, and just about everyone else worth mentioning that has shaped globalisation.<p>It'll basically teach you the history off globalisation, and do so in an engaging way.<p>And no I don't have fringe economic views, even though I'm an economist by training ;-)",1224806156

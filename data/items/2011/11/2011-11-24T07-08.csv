And the cutoff is around $100k in income. A large portion are white-collar office workers at the upper-end of their companies' pay scales, or not even that upper end for technology firms, and people with no degrees aren't commonly found there (take a look at the top 500 employees at Boeing, Exxon, or Goldman Sachs, for example).",1322121590

Outsider? No chance. Why allow every peasant to add stuff, right?.<p>I derive this assumption from your statement that his contribution, effort and attitude was ""wrong"", ""minimal"", and ""poisonous"". I don't see any of that. I see a rant following a genuine effort to contribute, a contribution worth considering, and an attitude that started off with the best intent but got punched down in the process. Who wouldn't turn sour after such an experience? It's called cause and effect. Of couse you'll be pissed if something as ludicrous as this happens to you.<p>Unless you're so caught up in your little world of the 'inner circle' that you don't tolerate outsiders. Unfortunately, that's not how the world works. That's also not how Wikipedia is supposed to work, I hope. That doesn't sound like the spirit that Wikipedia tries to portray at all. It sounds like the exact opposite.<p>On your ""consensus"" argument: since when is a 7-6 vote a consensus? That's a nearly even split. Please.",1322121188

</i><p>But there are also clearly defined rules for how to participate in Wikipedia, which you just disregarded as rules made ""such that only the elite who have busted their chops should be able to [contribute]"". You see, if you write an article without any sources or references, badly formated, without interlinks etc, it's really of no help to us -- getting it into shape (i.e. formatting, finding sources) will take more time than rewriting it from scratch. We can create crappy articles about not notable subjects ourselves, thank you. Do you also think that Linus Torvalds is wrong with rejecting patchs which do not meet guidelines? Do you think it's unfair to make people read and care about Linux guidelines? Do you think it will make  Linux a dead community?",1322119439

Something's not working.<p>I've been in the Bay Area going on my second year now and I'm wondering how common it is to come out here and eventually get turned off by the whole scene, in general.<p>Back in the beginning, I grew up as a huge nerd in the Southeast - it was always my thing. I could hide away in my bedroom and hack, as the world around me held down mostly non-technical lifestyles. When I emerged, I had a product of my own creation, mostly untainted by the scene's societal norms, that everyone around me thought was really 'neat', since they had no idea how it worked or, for the few technical people I knew, were interested in learning about it and/or were happy to teach me more. In my off time, I could resume doing non-technical things and 'blend in' and, when I was ready to again, retire to my bedroom and begin being a hacker again.<p>My Bay Area experience has, overall, proven to be a mostly disenchanting departure from this.<p>Everyone here is into tech.
There is no way 'hiding away and making an iPhone app' is your unique thing.
The instant you show your work to anyone else, you almost certainly encounter one or more of:<p>-a pissing contest<p>-criticism of implementation details or features, language choice, etc<p>-comparison to someone/something else far more prolific and a subsequent lack of being impressed<p>-or, if you've found a non-technical person to demo to, a lack of interest simply because it's not a world-changing tech like Facebook or Twitter, which is down the street<p>Don't get me wrong. I'm not making crap, here, nor am I a new kid on the block. I've worked at Google, Apple, and Microsoft and am currently one of two engineers at a small company you may well have seen in TechCrunch a few times.<p>But is it normal to be so dejected by this area that you're turned off to lots of things, entirely? And is that necessarily a bad thing or an implicit professional/personal failure, of sorts?<p>I can appreciate the fact the Bay Area is fast-paced, meritocratic, high stress, all of that. Those are good things!<p>But, operating in the Bay Area is quickly draining the love of the game from me. In fact, I often find myself considering moving somewhere slightly-but-not-mostly technical, like Austin or Charlotte (hey, I have a thing for the South, too).<p>Anyone else experience this roadblock? Any tips or suggestions? I'm young and an open book and you'll have my eternal gratitude.",1322119409

It's also not OK to sue parents for singing Happy Birthday to their child in a 20 secs YouTube video. I also don't think it's OK to sue anybody for singing a song, unless he does it for commercial purposes. It's also not OK to demand tens of thousands of dollars for a single song you downloaded illegally. Or to sue children or grandmas.<p>Another problem is that <i>sharing</i> is in human nature.

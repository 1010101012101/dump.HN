I&#x27;d like to save 9 months worth of expenses or about $60k+.<p>What are the best tactics and strategies that other Self Employed Software Contractors use to save cash, especially on their taxes?<p>Some friends have advised setting up a company, and in the past I knew someone who set up an S or C corp and paid a wage, while the remaining profit was sent out as a dividend.  But what do others do?<p>I know a 3rd option would be to use what ever funds I earn and try to leverage that, so if you have any ideas there that might be an interesting option as well.<p>Right now on prosper.com i&#x27;m able to get a 15% average return, and in the stock market I have been doing 20% year over year in my IRA, but these are not good tools to get ready for starting a company.<p>One option I have thought about would be to &#x27;start&#x27; the company now, and then push all of the cash into it, and then later just work on what ever project that company would later produce.<p>Thoughts?",1380689966

6480714,comment,6480631,6480631,6,0,fusiongyro,,,"The Lisp machine operating system was written in Lisp. In fact, it was Lisp all the way down to the microcode, or at least, it would present the microcode in Emacs as if it were Lisp, and you could modify it there. The Lisp machine OS was similar to other OSes of the age, more capable in many ways.<p>A modern OS is a huge amount of work. It&#x27;s so vast, your choice of language isn&#x27;t going to make or break you. Moving a mountain with a tablespoon should proceed three times faster than with a teaspoon. You&#x27;re still looking at an eternity if you&#x27;re the only guy.<p>For this reason, your best bet is to narrow in. Decide what it is you want to write an OS for. Do you want to explore novel user experiences? C# is probably fine for that. You don&#x27;t need to write the whole OS there, just the &quot;shell&quot; and the window manager. You can do that now, and not spend any time dealing with drivers. Do you want to experiment with microkernel or exokernel architecture? You&#x27;ll be breaking new ground. Is C# OK for that? What you&#x27;re really asking is, what are the limitations of C# that you&#x27;ll run into? The GC pause is one, another is dealing with raw bytes and making it perform. If make the CLR self-hosting, you&#x27;re going to find performance problems like crazy. If you make fixing that your mission, you could be a hero like the PyPy guys, and everything gets better, or you might just be throwing away a lot of work.<p>I happen to think a lot of interesting problems would benefit from a high-level approach. Security is a declarative process. You want to say what you want secured and not how. Only one system I know of has ever used Prolog for this (MeeGo, IIRC?) but it was probably a perfect fit. There are lots of opportunities for this kind of thing in OSes and they&#x27;re never really exploited. If your whole kernel is C and you want to add a declarative security module, well, you&#x27;ll be writing C. You can surely accomplish the same tasks in C as C#, but if it&#x27;s a pain in the ass you&#x27;ll either wind up with a weaker or more limited version in C, or you&#x27;ll spend more time writing and polishing it. But the world is ripe for a few people to take the unpopular tradeoff and see how well it works out, rather than taking their predecessor&#x27;s word for it.<p>To sum up, they&#x27;re not suitable for the whole job from start to finish. However, if you tried it, you&#x27;d make some interesting stuff, and learn a lot, maybe even make things better for other people. Take a crack at it. Worst thing that could happen is you fail. :)",1380689947

The analysis he links to on the profitability of mining is based on litecoin, he claims it&#x27;s the same, but it&#x27;s simply not.<p>Quick calculations on bare avalon chips with a 100k investment gives a current ROI of <i>4 days</i>, this does not account for risk, does not account for setting up the chips, etc etc etc. However, it is indicative of the idea that the pursuit would be &quot;unprofitable&quot; is pretty insane.<p>The 90+ bitcoin mining accounts giving you the ability to game the system is even worse, it&#x27;s like he doesn&#x27;t have the faintest idea of how bitcoin mining even works.

That was entertaining - and repetitive.  Challenges remain ahead of me in the form of Belgarath and Fionnghal, but unless some exciting new aspect to the gameplay emerges during those challenges, I don&#x27;t think I would pay for an extension to the single player game.  If I&#x27;d watched someone else play the game instead of playing it myself, I don&#x27;t think I would now spend the $1 to $4 I would have otherwise been willing to spend.<p>My disinterest in paying for an extension to the single player game means I don&#x27;t have any reason to consider paying for unlockable wizards, custom spells, or forums and betas.<p>OK - I wrote the above before trying the multiplayer game.  Having now tried the multiplayer game, I found that to be much more fun, and much less predictable.  Would I consider paying something now?  Maybe.

As a result I&#x27;d noticed in the past that he prefers engaging with other adults in conversation over kids his age.<p>Yesterday was his first PTA meeting and the feedback from his teacher seemed to confirm it too.

The rest of his class was more fascinated with the talk about firecrackers.<p>Her nuanced point was that our son tends to get ahead of ideas and actions by engaging in a to-and-fro conversation about the logic/explanation behind them, thus at times preventing him from enjoying or taking in the idea or action itself or talking with other kids his age.<p>One of her suggestions was to &quot;explain less&quot; and let our son figure out things on his own (easier said than done, because he&#x27;s extremely inquisitive and persistent).<p>The larger point I&#x27;m trying to make is that high vocabulary can also act as a barrier in kids engaging with others their age.

The alternative to this is having a way to specify that the note should remain offline (in localstorage or somesuch) and never touch the server.<p>- Ability to take the app offline and have it work mostly the same (without search of course)/<p>- Web clipping (see the Evernote web clipper) with image rehosting<p>- Markdown support<p>- Desktop client<p>- Client side plugins (these make the rest of the above much easier), ideally written in something like JS or Python.<p>- Full-featured API<p>I really just want something where I can feel like I&#x27;m in control.

Methamphetamine use has a high association with depression and suicide as well as serious heart disease, amphetamine psychosis, anxiety, and violent behaviors. Methamphetamine also has a very high addiction risk.[12]
Unlike cocaine and amphetamine, methamphetamine is directly neurotoxic to midbrain dopamine neurons.[27] Moreover, methamphetamine use is associated with an increased risk of Parkinson&#x27;s disease due to the fact that uncontrolled dopamine effluxion is neurotoxic.[11][28] Long-term dopamine upregulation occurring as a result of methamphetamine abuse can also cause neurotoxicity, which is believed to be responsible for causing persisting cognitive deficits, such as memory loss, impaired attention, and decreased executive function. Similar to the neurotoxic effects on the dopamine system, methamphetamine can also result in neurotoxicity to serotonergic neurons.[29]",1380688972

If it begins to cost more to mine Bitcoin than it is worth (considering all costs into consideration), more people will start exchanging fiat into Bitcoin and fewer people will mine. This will reduce the mining difficulty while increasing the BTC/USD rates.<p>2. You got to be kidding. The fastest US supercomputer is about 18 peta flops. The world&#x27;s fastest is about 35 peta flops. The Bitcoin network difficulty crossed 12,000 petaflops or around that range, depending on how you calculate it.<p>3. The first mover advantage is a disadvantage because you might think of a situation where some legal entity in some country might think of outlawing Bitcoin without ever figuring out how to enforce it?<p>4.

I could go really in-depth here, but Microsoft is really bad at Art and Politics, which I would argue were the keys to the iPhones success.<p>3) The iPhone is a triumph for a number of reasons, but I tend to think the social conventions the iPhone destroyed were the most interesting part. I mean, I was working at AT&T when the iPhone dropped.<p>Before the iPhone:<p>* Everything was free phone at the low end and $199 at the top end<p>* Apps were pre-loaded onto phones<p>* Carriers drove handset manufacturers choice of OS<p>* No one ever waited for a phone<p>* Manufacturers did not care about UI/UX<p>* Phones sold on spec sheets<p>After the iPhone:<p>* Most people forget that the iPhone launched at a price point of $499 with no subsidy. They failed but this was Apple&#x27;s attempt to kill free phones, and they (sort of) did.<p>* App store (year 2)<p>* Manufacturers drove handset sales to Operators (and outside of operators)<p>* People line up for phones all the time<p>* Everyone cares about UI/UX<p>* Phones sell by Operating System (And UI/UX)<p>I could go on and on. There are so many things that changed because of design decisions by Cupertino.<p>No, Danger could not have done the iPhone. Not because of technical limitations, but because of politics.

I wouldn&#x27;t start with 15-20 minutes either - you won&#x27;t be able to maintain it, your muscles in your mouth will get tired.<p>You need to rinse after with a roughly half-water, half-hydrogen peroxide mix - after spitting the oil into your toilet (into sink could cause clogging issues) - and swish it around in your mouth for 10-15 seconds, through your teeth, etc.. This will help whiten your teeth too - most toothpaste companies add a bit of hydrogen peroxide to the toothpaste for this effect.<p>Spit isn&#x27;t as dense as oil, and so it won&#x27;t create as much pressure when being squeezed through your gums - which will loosen out anything stuck in your gums, that floss could otherwise get, and instead of floss jamming in say a piece of meat in further, the swishing and suction that occurs from a &#x27;tight&#x27; vacuum in your mouth helps pull the stuck material away.<p>You don&#x27;t have to swish for 15-20 minutes either, even a few minutes will do similar - though 15-20 minutes has added benefits, mainly related to the blood flow with your tongue, and the muscles in your mouth / throat, etc..

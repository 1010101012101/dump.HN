So he explained his future-to-be-communicated-to-encrypted contacts how his encryption method works so that they could decrypt it one they get the apparently obfuscated looking message. The Navajo Indians had a native language which was not close to any widely spoken language. This advantage and the small area where this language was spoken (only their part in America where they live) made them a perfect target for the US cryptographic division during the Second World War. They could communicate via radio with each other (e.g. between ships of the same battle-group) and the opposing forces would not understand what they are saying. The low degree of resemblance with other languages would have only left the opponents with the option to capture one Navajo alive and threat him into translating for you.

But when you <i>are</i> operating on the same node, asynchronous message passing is sometimes an awkward and less performant solution. It's strictly weaker than synchronous message passing, which means you never have any assurance that the other process received your message. Message passing can also be less performant than properly protected usage of shared memory, which transactional memory allows.<p>Erlang's popularity for concurrent programming probably comes down to the fact that <i>anything</i> is better than manually managed locks and until recently there weren't any widely-used industrial languages that used synchronous message passing or transactional memory. I don't think it's any coincidence, though, that the designers of more recent concurrent languages like Go and Clojure have not followed the Erlang model.",1322738204

I have many NXT 2.0 kits and also a nice environment for hardware production with the arduino platform (with everything even an oscilloscope). Usually, the Legos are used for the younger kids, and if they are more attracted to building stuff than programming then they fork into the open hardware tracks.\nMy advice is to work through projects. Just how real life works, and what the kids find more interesting: there is a problem to solve or an specification on what they want to build, and from that you and them sit down, organize your thoughts, make the design, and then build it, test it, improve it. They love it, it works very well, and keeps you doing very very interesting stuff always with something different. A completely hands on experience, and they learn by doing.\nAs for which arduino kit you would use, anyone will do it. But when they are just starting with arduino, maybe it's better to keep it simple (but always as a part of solving a problem, not doing it to ""learn how to turn a LED on""). The best thing is to locate a store and work always with them, so look at what kits they have and choose from there. That's how I do it here in Germany, and worked very well.\nIf you yourself have no experience on arduino or open hardware, I recommend you to choose some book to build little projects from it, so your choice of the kit will be dictated by the kit used on the book.\nAnyway, congrats for the teaching!",1322737794

Your dollar now buys more than it did before. <i>Taxation</i> is zero-sum. Your dollar that you would have spent literally gets taken from you to be spent somewhere else. No wealth is created. Similarly, no wealth is lost when people evade tax - but we do have less for the government to spend obviously.<p>Also, at a large scale &quot;the customers&quot; are the same as &quot;society.&quot;<p>Externalities are an important topic but what are those externalities?

Biographies of scientists were not part of curriculum either. It&#x27;s really the culture. Parents did care about kids&#x27; academic performance, a lot. The whole society advocated studying hard with the right approach (whether it&#x27;s really right is debatable). Even state media devote significant time to STEM related news and documentaries.

6870458,comment,6870019,6870019,2,0,vezzy-fnord,,,"<i>One of the biggest reasons for that lack of interest is that students have been turned off to the subjects as they move from kindergarten to high school. Many are being taught by teachers who have no particular expertise in the subjects. They are following outdated curriculums and textbooks. They become convinced they’re “no good at math,” that math and science are only for nerds, and fall behind.<p>That’s because the American system of teaching these subjects is broken. For all the reform campaigns over the years, most schools continue to teach math and science in an off-putting way that appeals only to the most fervent students. The mathematical sequence has changed little since the Sputnik era: arithmetic, pre-algebra, algebra, geometry, trigonometry and, for only 17 percent of students, calculus. Science is generally limited to the familiar trinity of biology, chemistry, physics and, occasionally, earth science.</i><p>These two paragraphs capture the essence of the issue.<p>In fact, forgive me for bringing up the topic of compulsory schooling and deliberately defective education again, but I think I might have an interesting tidbit to share on this, which paints a rather ugly picture of the whole situation.<p>An excerpt from Charlotte Iserbyt&#x27;s <i>the deliberate dumbing down of america</i> (Revised and Abridged Edition [2011], Ch 2: The Turning of the Tides, p. 31, c. 1928):<p>-------------------<p>&quot;1928: A deliberate math &quot;dumb down&quot; was seriously discussed in 1928. A teacher named O.A. Nelson, John Dewey, Edward Thorndike (who conducted early behavioral psychology experiments on chickens), and other Council on Foreign Relations members attended a Progressive Education Association meeting in 1928 at which O. A. Nelson was informed that the purpose of &quot;new math&quot; was to dumb down students. Nelson revealed in a later interview with Young Parents Alert that the Progressive Education Association was a communist front. According to the National Educator (July 1979):<p>Mr. O. A. Nelson, retired educator, has supplied the vitally important documentation needed to support the link-up between the textbooks and the Council on Foreign Relations. His letter was first printed in &quot;Young Parents Alert&quot; (Lake Elmo, Minnesota). His story is self-explanatory.<p>I know from personal experience what I am talking about. In December 1928, I was asked to talk to the American Association for the Advancement of Science. On December 27th, naïve and inexperienced, I agreed. I had done some special work in teaching functional physics in high school. That was to be my topic. The next day, the 28th, a Dr. Ziegler asked me if I would attend a special educational meeting in his room after the AAAS meeting. We met from 10 o&#x27;clock [p.m.] until after 2:30 a.m.<p>We were 13 at the meeting. Two things caused Dr. Ziegler, who was chairman of the Educational Committee of the Council of Foreign Relations, to ask me to attend… my talk on the teaching of functional physics in high school, and the fact that I was a member of a group known as the Progressive Educators of America, which was nothing but a Communist front. I thought the word &quot;progressive&quot; meant progress for better schools.<p>Eleven of those attending the meeting were leaders in education. Drs. John Dewey and Edward Thorndike, from Columbia University, were there, and the others were of equal rank. I checked later and found that ALL were paid members of the Communist Party of Russia. I was classified as a member of the Party, but I did not know it at the time.<p>The sole work of the group was to destroy our schools! We spent one hour and forty-five minutes discussing the so-called &quot;Modern Math.&quot; At one point I objected because there was too much memory work, and math is reasoning; not memory. Dr. Ziegler turned to me and said,<p>&quot;Nelson, wake up! That is what we want… a math that the pupils cannot apply to life situations when they get out of school!&quot;<p>That math was not introduced until much later, as those present thought it was too radical a change. A milder course by Dr. Beckner was substituted but it was also worthless, as far as understanding math was concerned. The radical change was introduced in 1952. It was the one we are using now. So, if pupils come out of high school now, not knowing any math, don&#x27;t blame them. The results are supposed to be worthless.&quot;<p>------------------",1386525470

So effectively, out of towners pay the tax when they get a hotel room.

6870428,comment,6870078,6870249,11,0,bmelton,,,"I upvoted you, but I think I disagree largely with the sentiment you expressed.  As one of those wacky libertarians, I&#x27;d like to defend (what I think is) the default liberty-oriented position.  Disclaimer, the following is a series of value judgements, and not necessarily steeped in fact.<p>The argument isn&#x27;t necessarily one based on &#x27;more&#x27; vs. &#x27;less&#x27; government, but &#x27;Constitutionally prescribed&#x27; government size.  The Constitution speaks of a small federal government, whose purpose it is to defend the rights of individuals from potentially abusive state governments.  The Constitution places a higher value on individual liberty than efficiency of government.  We see this reflected in separation of powers, an adversarial Congress, limited terms of office, etc., etc.<p>For many, we see the Constitution as the central governing document of our nation.  We don&#x27;t see it as perfect, in any sense, and we will readily admit to its flaws and faults.  Some of us (self included) will even concede that we aren&#x27;t adept enough at examining social policy to be able to say assertively that a Nordic model of government wouldn&#x27;t be objectively &quot;better&quot; at granting citizens the liberties they desire.  What we can say, fairly definitively, is that we can&#x27;t have a Nordic model of government with the Constitution as it exists.<p>That isn&#x27;t necessarily horrible, or untenable.  We can get there from here.  We can ratify, amend, and hell, even rewrite the Constution, using Constitutionally prescribed measures.  There are, as I stated, <i>many</i> faults with the Constitution, but this is where it excels.  Where public sentiment changes broadly enough that there is a clear consensus, it should be easy to ratify the Constitution to get us where we need to be.  Where we don&#x27;t have a clear consensus, it should be very hard -- and indeed it is.<p>The faults we see with the existing government are generally the faults we see where they have deviated from adhering to the Constitution.  The Constitution prescribes transparency in law-making, and to that end, we have a generally open Congress, whereupon we can interact with our legislators and make our opinions known.  However, to circumvent that, the president has recently been exercising &quot;Executive Order&quot;, and/or delegation to agencies, who have lawmaking authority, but without the same degree of transparency has.  If the FDA decides that they want to impose a regulation, for example, they can do so without the passage of a law, despite the fact that the regulation may have _de_ _facto_ authority as a law.<p>Similarly, executive order bypasses this process.  That isn&#x27;t to suggest it is inherently evil, as we&#x27;ve seen it used for both good and ill, and with varying effectiveness.  Regardless, it circumvents (IMO) Constitutionally prescribed law-making procedures.<p>I think that most people, left, right, center or fringe, that the bill of rights, <i>generally</i>, should be treated as sacrosanct, especially where those provisions relate to the first amendment, religious exercise, etc..  People disagree on others, and that&#x27;s fine -- where there&#x27;s a clear consensus, it should be easy for the second amendment to be repealed.  There isn&#x27;t, so it hasn&#x27;t been, so the government has taken half-measures (again, IMO) in an attempt to side-step the bill of rights in lieu of ratification, to appease their political base.  The other, major flaw, is that people&#x27;s beliefs are fungible.  They believe that freedom of speech is sacrosanct, and would point to the first amendment as evidence of that, but so often, they would turn around and suggest that the second amendment is outdated, or relegate its provisions to &#x27;muskets&#x27;, without similarly acknowledging that first amendments should then not be applicable to digital media, telephones, or whatever other implements did not exist in the late 1700s.<p>As pertaining to capitalism, our stance is that true capitalism hasn&#x27;t ever really been tried -- almost as certainly as we&#x27;ve had capitalism, we&#x27;ve just as readily had crony capitalism.  In tech, we can readily speak to the abusive power of patents, and we all know for how long they&#x27;ve stifled innovation, been used to discourage new competitors and free market competition.  Why we aren&#x27;t all able to agree that <i>most</i> regulations imposed by government are done to similar effect is always slightly baffling to me, because they absolutely are.  An early entrant to a new market is often able to transfer some of their economic might into political sway, making it harder and harder for new entrants to take either from them, widening the income disparity as well as the ability to narrow it using the free market.<p>That isn&#x27;t to suggest that we shouldn&#x27;t all act more communally -- we absolutely should, and it should be encouraged at every step, though never forced.  I recently co-established a 501c3 charity to help mitigate the out-of-pocket spending that our teachers often undergo so that they can ensure their children have supplies.  They&#x27;re already underpaid, more often than not, and on average, they spend, out of pocket, up to $2000 a year on supplies that aren&#x27;t being provided by parents or the school systems.  In researching this, I&#x27;ve found what seems to be common advice that &quot;the government is required to provide supplies, so you shouldn&#x27;t buy any of them,&quot; and while that&#x27;s said, I&#x27;m able to see both sides of this argument -- if the government is taxing us, and that taxes goes towards the foundation and operation of schools, then we&#x27;ve already paid our part, and weren&#x27;t given much of a say in the matter.  Contrarily though, I&#x27;d want to encourage more voluntaryism in ensuring that teachers aren&#x27;t operating at a loss in order to educate our children; we should free them from as many burdens as we&#x27;re able to enable them to be more effective at educating, which is their job, not procurement.<p>So, what&#x27;s the answer?  Clearly, we should be more communally minded, but many feel that since that communality has been mandated, and that their contributions to society have already been forcibly taken, that they <i>are</i> contributing, whether they like it or not.<p>Probably, the answer is somewhere in the middle, and I don&#x27;t claim to know where it is.  I agree that we don&#x27;t currently have it, and our politicians (on both sides) pandering to their political bases isn&#x27;t actually making us any progress.  I don&#x27;t know that necessarily a reversion to a smaller government gets us there either, nor do I know that a Nordic model does -- both have worked in isolated instances, but I haven&#x27;t seen anything convincing that either would work well for us, here, with the people that we have.  So, to the libertarian, what we&#x27;re left with, generally speaking, is the Constitution... the rule book for how the nation is supposed to run, and it isn&#x27;t being followed, and things are poopy.  If we want to change the rules, the Constitution lets us, but instead, politicians on all sides are just cheating instead, and that <i>clearly</i> isn&#x27;t working.",1386524969

There are <i>many</i> reasons why certain buildings are not allowed to operate as hotels - just a few off my head:<p>- Bedbugs. They&#x27;re at pandemic levels in NYC, and the more volume of people moving in/out of a place the more likely you are to get them. Hotels are required to mitigate the bedbug threat with a level of thoroughness that simply is impossible unless the building owner is aware that there&#x27;s a hotel operating under their roof. I would be mighty pissed if I found a AirBnb in my building, as that <i>dramatically</i> raises everyone&#x27;s risk of infestation.<p>- Noise. Particularly in neighborhoods like mine that are restaurant and bar districts, where a large part of the attraction of the location is the ability to stumble home directly from an innumerable number of bars. Temporary residents have no incentive to keep things reasonable. Whenever this point is brought up you get a few anecdotal stories about &quot;the British family that was sooooo quiet&quot;, but no mention of the rest of the time where we&#x27;d have to put up with the noise.<p>- Security. I live in a small pre-war building with 20 units. I&#x27;ve met literally every one of my neighbors. This building isn&#x27;t Fort Knox - once you&#x27;re inside the main door it doesn&#x27;t take Harry Houdini to break into any one apartment. Real hotels have security cameras, personnel on-site, and much more elaborate locks on doors... we do not.<p>These are real risks and real harm happening to neighbors of guys like this. His actions have a negative impact. While calling him a sociopath might be a tad extreme, it certainly isn&#x27;t completely without merit.<p>None of these problems are unsolvable - but they are unsolvable unless the hoteling party is operating in the open.

Special relativity is about movement and how that causes length contractions, time dilations and a change of mass of the moving object. General relativity is about how mass (even at rest) dilates spacetime. So general relativity is about black holes and worm holes and how space itself maybe &quot;moves&quot;. There is no speed limit on how fast a region of space itself can move in relation to another region, thus it is ok that the universe expands at a speed where two regions are &quot;moving&quot; away from each other faster than the speed of light.<p>So if you could move space itself you could implement FTL travel, because this is not movement at all in the sense of special relativity. Some scientists say one could do that if you could create matter with a negative energy density, whatever that might mean.

I am on record here on HN as having participated in the Take Back the Fourth protest in Minneapolis about overreaching NSA surveillance. I was not afraid to go out in public in view of TV cameras and the police (the protest location was a plaza across the street from the headquarters of the Minneapolis police deparment, and I saw officers with cameras overlooking the protest location) to indicate that I think governmental surveillance, if it occurs at all, should be according to law, and strictly limited by law.<p>That said, I don&#x27;t treat Snowden as a hero, and I hope no one else in the United States emulates him, ever. He would have done a lot more good for humankind by increasing the NSA&#x27;s ability to conduct surveillance in China and in Russia (the two countries that have protected him so far) and in central Asia in general. And what has most struck me as I have conversations with American adults of approximately my age (birth years in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s) who remember more history is that they are mostly very eager to see Snowden prosecuted to the full extent of the law, which would probably mean spending the rest of his life in prison.<p>Yes, people choose where they work. And some people remember not to stab their co-workers in the back when they go to work. I have never chosen to work for NSA, and I would be glad to see NSA have more effective oversight from Congress and a more limited role in data-gathering. But the United States (like every other country in the world) needs some intelligence-gathering capabilities, and I seem to be joined in my daily activities by a lot of Americans who think that Snowden didn&#x27;t help anyone by revealing official secrets and that he has a very misguided set of priorities about which governments to oppose. My morale decreases to know that anyone who was contracting for NSA wasn&#x27;t checked out well enough to detect that tendency to treachery in advance.<p>The day the news broke that Edward Snowden had left Hong Kong, I was out of town at a soccer tournament with my daughter. The parents of her teammates, mostly younger than I am, heard me announce that news, and when one parent asked, what Snowden&#x27;s destination was, another said, &quot;Gitmo?&quot; with a smile that indicated that he thought Snowden belongs there. I find that reaction quite commonplace among Americans I know.<p>AFTER EDIT: I see the downvotes indicating disagreement are already coming here, and that is not a surprise here on Hacker News, but do we have strong evidence that the general opinion of the American public is united in supporting the HN community view of Snowden&#x27;s conduct as an NSA contractor? That&#x27;s one factual question worthy of factual discussion here, whether you agree with my opinion or not.<p>AFTER FURTHER EDITS: I appreciate the replies to my comment, practicing free speech to help me understand other people&#x27;s perspectives. I would say that it&#x27;s quite possible to be a genuine whistleblower without disclosing the degree of operational information that Snowden disclosed. And it is possible--it has been done--to decry current NSA practice and still stay in the United States, as some NSA officials have done in the last few years. I&#x27;ll check the polling data kindly shared in one reply. I&#x27;ll note that Americans my age and older (well above the modal or median age of HN participants) have multiple sources of information through which to form opinions on this issue, and don&#x27;t rely solely on governmental statements or influence from political leaders to make up our minds on these issues.",1386522754

I mean, kids are naturally inquisitive. Given the right nurturing, kids should love STEM. Heck, they should be obsessed with STEM because STEM subjects are full of wonders. Yet, what do kids nowadays think cool? Having access to alcohol and drugs is cool. Bullying people who take studying seriously is cool. Sports jockeys who think nothing is important other than their games with another high school are cool. When hearing people enthusiastically talk about technology, making a face as if he just ate s*&^t is cool (just like the stupid and weak Jesse did in the finale of Breaking Bad when Walt explained what &quot;exothermal&quot; meant). Whining about STEM are being too &quot;hard&quot;, too &quot;boring&quot;, too &quot;irrelevant&quot;, too &quot;nerdy&quot; is cool... And tell me the parents didn&#x27;t have very bad influence to the kids.<p>I find this phenomenon puzzling. STEM is foundation of the modern civilization. And it is Europeans and Americans, after all, who have largely advanced modern science, technology, engineering, and math in the past hundreds of years. I can tell fascinating stories about the great minds and great achievements for weeks. Yet, the great history, the great subjects, and the people who love STEM are being looked down upon by American kids? What.The.Fuck.<p>It was not like this in the country where I grew up, though. In our country, STEM are cool in school. Seriously cool. Teachers, kids, and especially parents take studying of STEM  seriously (though to be fair, the parents took every subject seriously as they cared about grades too). Biographies of famous scientists are popular readings. Names like Archimedes, Newton, Curie, Paulin, Ernest Lawrence, and so on are household names. No one in my school got despised because he or she studied hard. That would be absurd to even think about. That&#x27;s why I was initially bewildered by Paul Graham&#x27;s Why Nerds Are Unpopular.<p>And what&#x27;s the result of all these?

Avastin is used for a lot more than just eye conditions, it seems, and has shall we say a number of issues.<p>Something most people fail to realise is exactly how expensive new drug development actually is. You&#x27;ve got experimental labs doing in-vivo tests of thousands of molecules (at least), animal studies to ensure the human trials will be safe, multiple stages of clinical trials in humans with associated insurance, etc. The sole means of recuperating the cost  of all of this is through product sales. There are very few actual grants awarded for developing medicines all the way through to production. No tie-in marketing of lunch boxes. No crowdfunding from patient groups.<p>I do wholeheartedly agree, however, that there are perverse incentives on doctors to prescribe more expensive medication, and the modern pharmaceutical industry is messed up in so many ways. Most doctors too don&#x27;t even understand properly what it is they are prescribing[1], and the 21st century medical representative system has more in common with jingles and home appliance sales than the clinical educators of the 20th century.<p>Disclosure: I have family and friends working in this field<p>[1] Reasons why people become doctors: money, power and helping people. Good doctors get to chose two of out of three.

However, there is a huge difference in the essence: Lisp macros work on the syntactic level, monads compose on the semantics level.<p>Lisp macros are not bound by types, so they can be combined irregardless of a program semantics, potentially producing any kind of incorrect code as the result. Such errors get especially tricky with several layers of quasiquotation.<p>In Haskell, the program meaning is partially encoded into types, so the compiler can understand your intention much better and assists you in programming it right. Also, getting some kind of inter-part optimization is much easier in Haskell: you know exactly what kind of pieces you are gluing up.",1452163616

First of all its wielded as if work somehow is valuable in it self and thus warrants &quot;compensation&quot;.

It&#x27;s very difficult to know the optimal price. I use split testing for some things but it feels wrong to do this for price, and with current conversion rate it would take ages to get meaningful results anyway. I&#x27;m hesitant to push price too high because lowering it back down would be tricky. Existing users paying a higher price would be annoyed. Also, at this stage I think increasing the user base would be more valuable long term compared to milking the current users for more money.

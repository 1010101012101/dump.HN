We pretty much bootstrapped and have 5 employees now, making a decent amount of money. But I haven&#x27;t been to uni for the last 1.5 years, because I was rather working. I haven&#x27;t told anyone yet that I haven&#x27;t passed or even attended a single exam after my second semester.\nI&#x27;m not sure what exactly I&#x27;m asking for, but what are the Pros and Cons of completely dropping out of uni in favor of the secure job / the company?",1425661180

I started using it about 2 years ago not because I had an ideological problem with utorrent, but because it had much better performance on my laptop.

I got two cats (bonded pair) from a shelter in August 2013 and they&#x27;ve been a dream. Shelter life isn&#x27;t easy for animals, but it doesn&#x27;t typically break them (a few handle it badly, but most are psychologically normal after a couple weeks in a new home).<p>You&#x27;re taking a bet with any kind of new pet, but you&#x27;re probably getting a healthier animal, on average, with a mutt from a shelter than if you get a breed animal, even from a &quot;responsible&quot; (i.e. not puppy-mill) breeder. The better shelters don&#x27;t do <i>that</i> much psychiatric damage, and most of it&#x27;s not long-term. This idea that shelter animals are all psychiatric/behavioral basketcases is both untrue and very damaging.<p>I prefer no-kill shelters for finding pets. Part of it is selfishness (I don&#x27;t like feeling like not choosing an animal will condemn it to death) and some of it is ideology (I don&#x27;t agree that it&#x27;s &quot;euthanasia&quot; to kill healthy feral animals; who are we to decide that they&#x27;d be better off dead?) but I also know that NK shelters (which source from &quot;kill&quot;/open-admission shelters, so you&#x27;re still saving a life) are staffed by people who are experts (at least, relative to me) in selecting adoptable, healthy animals who are unlikely to have behavioral problems.",1425661050

It&#x27;s not even an EULA, it&#x27;s just a copyright license.<p>And btw, compared to BSD/MIT, the GPL also contains a patents grant (implicit but powerful enough for version 2, explicit for version 3). And unfortunately in this universe, the big companies contributing to open-source also have really big patents portfolios, therefore I always look suspiciously at code licensed with BSD/MIT. And unfortunately patent trolls are a reality.<p>If you prefer more permissive licenses, then go for the Apache 2.0 ;-)",1425661016
9158031,comment,9156644,9157431,0,0,yetanotherjosh,,,"It would be more useful instead of speaking in terms of different degrees of ownership to speak specifically in terms of what is owned and what isn&#x27;t. In GPL software, you not only own the functioning application but you own (within certain privilege restrictions) the source code, and therefore can modify that source code to produce a new, different piece of software that you also own.<p>Compare this to your song analogy. A GPL&#x27;d song would also provide the original production project &quot;source&quot; - the raw studio recordings of each track, the digital audio workstation file project that compiles it all together and renders the final single stereo track. You could then modify the song by removing individual elements, changing the mix, changing the arrangement, etc, and render out a new stereo song. Very few artists actually do this, because it&#x27;s a weird idea that somehow the software industry has latched onto that no other sections care much about or think is particularly important, because they haven&#x27;t been bitten by this strangely worded &quot;freedom&quot; bug.<p>Or the table analogy: not only do you own the table, you own the design documents, the factory floor plan, the knowledge of what saws and blades and bolt suppliers were used to assemble it. You can then use that knowledge to produce new tables with modified designs. Etc.<p>In other words your physical goods analogy falls pretty short unless you separate it into the functional object or IP and the original, complex information that allows one to actually produce modified versions of that object or IP.",1425661008

I mean, if you want to distribute a closed source product, then you&#x27;re working against what the FSF and GPL were created for, and it&#x27;s wise to stay away from them. Remember, free software doesn&#x27;t measure its success  by the number of corporations that choose their code to use in closed source products, but by the amount of freedom it gives to its users (not just the developers).

All of them ended up failing to go upstream for a number of reasons 1) pushed too much complexity into the kernel (complicating the regular code paths) 2) caused regressions in performance in sync read/write 3) were based on functionality that the upstream developers did not want (tasklets).<p>With that background of various failed attempts, my approach focuses on a common use case in modern servers: a network pool loop and a disk IO thread thread pool. That&#x27;s pretty much how everybody works around lack of async disk IO. The big problem with that is additional latency. That latency comes from synchronization (between two threads) and queuing (cached data stuck in queue behind long running requests).<p>My solution tackles that latency by letting us answer in the same network thread if data is cached by the kernel.<p>I tried this using samba (kernel guys like this use case) and I was able to get close to sync like latency / throughput vs. ~23% lower numbers with pure thread pool.

Good luck trying to explain transcendental numbers or the number of servers Google has to the Piraha tribe, right (heck, they&#x27;re actually not even interested)? This is modified partly by how deep the person is in their domain as well as how smart they can be (horizontal thinking mostly). For example, in the cloud infrastructure business, a LOT of people that are in charge of companies&#x27; infrastructures are in their late 40s, 50s, and 60s, and it&#x27;s been a struggle oftentimes to explain basic concepts like image-based deployments, cross-region failover, etc. The dad from Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs lives in a world of fishing in his head obviously - maybe you&#x27;ll have to learn a little bit about fishing to communicate with him right.

The use of the GNU GPL on code is explicitly <i>not</i> a donation of that code; it’s a contract attached to the code which has both technical and social implications. (It is also a political statement because of the preamble text, but that is neither here nor there for the purposes of this issue.) So Christoph did <i>not</i> donate his code; he put it out for use with specific terms and conditions. The only way to donate your code for any use whatsoever is to declare it in the public domain. This doesn’t work for some jurisdictions—Germany does not allow for this. This is why SQLite’s license page‡ talks about purchasing a licence (see more on the mailing list°).<p>‡ <a href=""http://sqlite.org/copyright.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sqlite.org/copyright.html</a>\n° <a href=""https://www.mail-archive.com/sqlite-users@sqlite.org/msg24372.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.mail-archive.com/sqlite-users@sqlite.org/msg2437...</a><p>There are two points that most people confuse themselves on with respect to the GNU GPL, and they’re captured in this sentence:<p>> …If someone then uses the work for their own financial benefit, or modifies it without giving you the changes back, what has that deprived you of?…<p>First, the GNU GPL says <i>nothing</i> about financial gain from the use or modification of the work in question <i>except</i> in terms of mere transmission of the work. That is, when you exercise your right under licence to a copy of the modified code, a company cannot charge you more than it costs them to prepare and send you the modified code. This particular clause comes from the point where the shipment of tapes was used to transmit code rather than the network, because both tapes and shipping had tangible costs.<p>Second, the GNU GPL says <i>nothing</i> about contributing changes back to the original author. What is required is that people who have (legitimately·) obtained a copy of the modified software are guaranteed the right to request a copy of the modified software’s source code. Further, those people are explicitly permitted under the GNU GPL to further modify and/or redistribute the code and/or their modified versions. The recipient is also permitted to make financial gain of their own, if they choose. (Under the GNU GPL v2, nothing prohibited those modified versions from being <i>useless</i> because you could not load the modified versions onto the target hardware. This is why the GNU GPL v3 has what people called the “TiVo” clause.)<p>· This leads to the reason for the GNU AGPL, after a fashion. If a company were to make “Lilypond as a service” with their own private modifications, they are not required to either contribute those modifications back to the original project or to their customers, because they are not distributing the software. Someone who hacks into their servers hand obtains the modified Lilypond binaries does not have the right to request the source because the LaaS company did not distribute the software. The Affero GPL is the version of the GNU GPL that requires service companies to make available even the private modifications because it redefines distribution as use, in this case.<p>I’m not a fan of any of the GNU GPL licences•, but <i>every</i> software developer or company that uses open source or GPLed software needs to have a better understanding of the licences that they are interacting with. Most of them are written in fairly accessible English—and if they aren’t, you probably shouldn’t be using them.<p>• The cooption of “free” and “freedom” for licences that are highly restrictive is detestable. The <i>effect</i> of these licences may be desirable in a number of cases, but there’s a level of doublespeak and disingenuousness around the GNU GPL family that turns me off.",1425659150

Happy to comment more if needed.<p>Information models are often superior to APIs, and almost always better than DSLs. The hyper-flexibility of a data structure literal allows Onyx workflows and catalogs to be constructed at a distance, meaning on another machine, in a different language, by another program, etc. Contrast this to Storm. Topologies are written with functions, macros, and objects. These things are <i>specific</i> to a programming language, and make it hard to work at a distance - specifically in the browser. JavaScript is the ultimate place to be when creating specifications.<p>Further, the information model for an Onyx workflow has the distinct advantage that it&#x27;s possible to compile other workflows (perhaps a datalog) into the workflow that Onyx understands.<p>See <a href=""https://github.com/MichaelDrogalis/onyx/blob/0.5.x/doc/user-guide/what-does-it-offer.md"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/MichaelDrogalis/onyx/blob/0.5.x/doc/user-...</a> for a continued explanation of why Onyx is more of an &quot;open&quot; concept.",1425658993

The GPL is similar to a contract like that, except that it says &quot;if you agree to redistribute your derived works under this same contract, you don&#x27;t owe any royalties at all.&quot; So it&#x27;s similarly reasonable to be taken to court for failing to comply with those terms, and forced to pay damages.<p>So I think the &quot;harm&quot; is that they failed to adhere to the contract they made with him.

So, its not like options that you choose whether and when to exercise are any <i>worse</i> in that respect.)",1425657692

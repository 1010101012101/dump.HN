No one answer is <i>entirely</i> the right answer. Further, there is no way to judge the validity of an answer, because it is usually an abstraction of a system that has been set up and there is no way on earth to know if it will fly or not.<p>The bigger problem is that the system assumes that people make an <i>informed</i> choice in the ballot, but it is quite clear that such people really don't exist. We are emotional beings who are able to react pretty strongly to abstract concepts and ideas. Whenever we believe something and make it a part of us, then it is impossible to have a rational or even a cordial discussion about it.<p>What's even more horrifying is that we haven't found a better way to govern ourselves than this. Everyday lives are at stakes because of decisions taken inside that system, and all I can do is stand by and stare at a computer screen.",1288969193

With that goal, however, there's currently far too much ""us-too"" leading to posturing and materialism and burnout.<p>Underneath that exterior, of course, there are a whole ton of people in art, music (huge underground music scene on the east side), and technology (lots of engineers and young doctors) doing wonderful things. I think it'll come as a surprise to many in the city that should that side of its culture ever take hold that they might have a chance of actually developing a unique city identity.<p>I'll also reiterate the point that Atlanta feels like a collection of unconnected neighborhoods instead of a real city. The place was burned down twice in history and rebuilt ostentatiously under the influence of zero central planning. Roads meander oddly and there's a demand for a car given the inadequate public transport MARTA provides. Traffic on the major in-city highway, which is a perpetually under construction connector between two major out of city highways, is almost always a parking lot and that spills into the city making rush hours tricky at best. I managed to bike everywhere which is adequate but not immediately safe. It can also be a bear to have to go 15 miles up and down hills to get to your favorite bar or a concert.",1288967867

1873194,story,,,2,1,hammock,"Ask HN: Why is mobile broadband still getting faster?",,"Let me explain the question. So for regular internet on the ground, there's a pretty simple reason why we started with dial-up and eventually moved to the broadband we have now- different types of cables carry different throughput, and we needed to put that infrastructure in place.<p>But mobile broadband is a different story- there are no cables, it's just radio waves and air of which there is a plethora. So what's the difference between 4G and 3G and 2G (why is it faster), and why didn't we have 4G from the very start- what innovation had to be made first?<p>Similarly, what obstacles must be overcome in the future to push the technology to go even faster?",1288965984

Personally, I had never heard of it before DHH&#x27;s 2006 RailsConf keynote. Could you point me to another web framework that had implemented it before 2006?<p>>  Some of the syntax was influenced by CoffeeScript (nobody doubts that -- in fact, TC39 members have explicitly referenced it on more than one occasion) but the features are neither novel nor unique to Ruby.<p>Again, CoffeeScript was popularized by the Ruby community, as uptake increased greatly when it became a default in Rails. The syntax was heavily influenced by Ruby, which then found its way into ES.next.<p>> Front-end build tools<p>The Rails asset pipeline was actually listed as the inspiration for Brunch, the closest you can get to replicating its functionality in JavaScript. This went a long way towards <i>popularizing</i> the notion.<p>> I agree that CoffeeScript is the first one that gained major traction in the startup scene
> although most teams seem to have realised that the drawbacks aren&#x27;t really worth it (not just the transpilation...<p>Yes, and CoffeeScript first gained traction within Rails. You also seem to be discounting the obvious popularity of ES.next transpilers.<p>> The Ruby community is very vocal and self-important but it&#x27;s neither as uniquely innovative nor as much of an influence as its members like to make it out to be. If PHP is the kindergarden of programming languages, Ruby is the angsty teenager complaining about how nobody understands them and writing blog posts about their deep insights gained from flipping through Atlas Shrugged.<p>This is rude, untrue, and unhelpful.

In PHP and ColdFusion, HTML is part of the language; in Ruby or Python it&#x27;s usually relegated to a templating library; in Javascript the <i>DOM</i> is usually a library and it&#x27;s bad practice to build up HTML strings (in 2015, at least; in 2008 it was <i>good</i> practice to build up HTML strings, because it was orders of magnitude faster than using the DOM).  In Matlab or R, statistical and linear-algebra functions are part of the language, while in Python they&#x27;re a library.  In C++, strings, hashtables, and arrays are part of the standard library (or not even that, in early versions), while in Python & Ruby, they&#x27;re part of the language.  In Lisp the language parser is part of the language; in Rust, C++ (under Clang), Python, and Go it&#x27;s part of the standard library; in many other languages it&#x27;s not available at all.<p>There are certain best practices that have emerged for general purpose languages.  Imba is not a general purpose language; it&#x27;s explicitly meant for web programming, and makes sense that it would build common web programming functionality into the language itself.",1440104206

It is testing to see if you know the tort of public disclosure of private facts and if you know about the right of publicity.<p>Importantly, let me be more clear:<p>* The definition of &quot;newsworthy&quot; in this case is a term of art, not a matter of &quot;it is not newsworthy in the same way that stories about the hulk are not newsworthy.&quot; Newsworthy, in this instance, does not mean <i>meritorious</i> as a subject of news, but <i>merely of public interest.</i> In this case, yes, it is newsworthy. This is the way courts use this word in this context.<p>* Case law is very, very resoundingly settled on this matter. Activity you conduct in public can be recorded and broadcast for a huge variety of purposes - end of story. The only really restricted purposes, in fact, are those that imply sponsorship or endorsement, or are injurious as a matter of <i>libel</i> - meaning there is a material falsehood. This question is structured, specifically, to see if the reader knows about the laws of libel and publicity - truth is a defense to libel (this is a true recount of facts occurring in the broadcast of the footage) and newsworthiness is an exception to violation of rights of publicity (which are typically only violated when implying sponsorship or endorsement).<p>The reason the questions don&#x27;t make sense, then, is for the very reason that a lot of people don&#x27;t respect what lawyers do (note: I am in now way implying you do not - you have put time and thought into your response and I found it very stimulating! I am talking in general) - because though we use english as the language of practice it does <i>not mean we use the commonly used english definitions of those words in the legal context.</i> Here, in this context, without knowing a fair amount of law, you wouldn&#x27;t know that there were specific privacy rights being dealt with and that &quot;newsworthy&quot; is a term of art. In other words, the question being asked is absolutely no less technical than the question on mortgages - except that mortgages are so esoteric no one accidentally mistakes understanding mortgages for the mere fact that they are explained in english words. If I could go back in time, I&#x27;d write laws in camelcaps to make it clear that the legal definition of newsWorthy is different than the lay meaning of newsworthy.",1440103935

10094526,comment,10091454,10093533,0,0,pluma,,,"> REST<p>No. Rails populated <i>a</i> form of REST and everybody likes to pretend everything Rails is REST and there are a ton of frameworks trying to imitate Rails&#x27; approach to REST but Rails neither invented REST nor was it the one thing making REST popular. It was a major factor, yes, but claiming this purely as an accomplishment of Ruby is silly.<p>I would be willing to give Ruby the point for MVC because of ActiveRecord but MVC is not synonymous with REST.<p>> Many parts of ES.next<p>Again, no. ES.next is nothing like Ruby. Some of the syntax was influenced by CoffeeScript (nobody doubts that -- in fact, TC39 members have explicitly referenced it on more than one occasion) but the features are neither novel nor unique to Ruby:<p>* The class syntax is pretty much universal.<p>* The arrow functions are evidently influenced by CoffeeScript but look nothing like Ruby&#x27;s lambda literals (which are the closest equivalent in Ruby). I think CoffeeScript&#x27;s use of that syntax was actually pre-dated by C# but I may be mistaken.<p>* Template strings have no more in common with CoffeeScript&#x27;s and Ruby&#x27;s string interpolation than with the same feature in other languages. In fact, if anything, I&#x27;d say the interpolation syntax is borrowed from PHP -- but the backticks certainly aren&#x27;t taken from any of them.<p>* Symbols are kinda like Ruby symbols if you tilt your head and squint really hard and then only focus on the name and not what they actually are. Again, the concept is neither novel nor unique to Ruby.<p>* Destructuring and rest/spread operators -- yeah, again, not unique or novel. Plus I think even Python preceded Ruby on that.<p>* iterators and generators -- again, closer to Python than to Ruby.<p>* import/export -- just an extension of the ideas of CommonJS which in turn aren&#x27;t anything like what Ruby has.<p>* promises -- no, sorry, not Ruby.<p>* the object literal extensions -- again, not Ruby. Ruby doesn&#x27;t even have object literals in the sense JS does (which is okay, it doesn&#x27;t have prototypal inheritance either).<p>> Front-end build tools<p>No, seriously not. Yes, rake pre-dates grunt and gulp by a fair amount (as well as jake and other JS-based tools barely anyone seems to use anymore). But it certainly didn&#x27;t invent them nor was the biggest factor in popularizing them. A lot of build tools before the Ruby (and now JS) toolchains came along were built in things like Java, in addition to the various less formalized build tools written in Python or simply bash.<p>> CSS pre-compilation<p>I may give you that. Less pre-dates Sass but started as a Ruby gem. Of course neither of them invented CSS minification and there were attempts at generating CSS before. Compass probably took the crown, though, even though front-end tools in generally have moved on to the Node ecosystem, which seems more appropriate for tools primarily concerned with JS (rather than Ruby, Java or bash).<p>> JS transpilation<p>Not <i>really</i>. Java-to-JS transpilation was the original hotness that opened up people to the idea. It was followed by various attempts to port other languages to JavaScript. I agree that CoffeeScript is the first one that gained major traction in the startup scene -- although most teams seem to have realised that the drawbacks aren&#x27;t really worth it (not just the transpilation but the entire part where everyone has to learn a new language on top of a solid understanding of JS itself).<p>Yes, CoffeeScript was an important step in the evolution of JS but so were DHTML, pop-unders, JSS and animated mouse cursors and status bars -- and everyone agrees those were a bad idea.<p>The Ruby community is very vocal and self-important but it&#x27;s neither as uniquely innovative nor as much of an influence as its members like to make it out to be. If PHP is the kindergarden of programming languages, Ruby is the angsty teenager complaining about how nobody understands them and writing blog posts about their deep insights gained from flipping through Atlas Shrugged.",1440103438

Self-checkout is one of, in my opinion, the least efficient tools in the world, yet everyone is obsessed with using self-checkout at the grocery store. It’s so much faster to just wait in line and have someone check out for you.”<p>There seem to be contradictory statements there. No wonder online vendors are killing the retail outlet.<p>Self checkout appears to be a way to lower both employee costs and customer satisfaction. These systems often don&#x27;t work well, and with the cashier staff reduced to minimums, often it takes longer to un-wedge the self checkout process than to wait for the one or two human cashiers among the 20+ unused registers. My local Target and Home Depot stores come to mind.<p>> In actuality, I think Amazon is highly inefficient if you don’t know what you’re buying because you don’t have anyone to help you and say, ‘No, actually, this is better than that.’<p>That service died with the management ilk of chains like Circuit City in the US that replaced experienced, knowledgable salespeople with underpaid &quot;ad pushers&quot;, trained in nothing more than moving the hot item of the week. In some cases I found it most efficient to order online for pickup at the local store, and bypass all the unhelpful &quot;help&quot;.<p>With Amazon, I can at least read reviews, attempt to pick out those that are informed, and get some actual information.

This gives us the best chance of picking the Japanese word that a Japanese native speaker would choose for a given English word.<p>As for the furigana, since we&#x27;re taking arbitrary user input, there are bound to be mistakes here or there, and that&#x27;s the case with this app too.

What about web sites and mobile apps giving people a way to give feedback to the company (something as simple as a Tweet box that says &quot;give instant public feedback&quot;) that simply tweets out the message using their account?

Allows you to taste more different (craft or otherwise) beers in one sitting, and you won&#x27;t get as drunk/hung over.<p>Say you drink 0.25l of a 9% beer along with 0.25l of water (probably a bit more water, actually). The water fills you up, breaks your drinking &quot;speed&quot; -- and now you&#x27;ve technically had 0.5 of 4.5% beer.<p>In my experience, what really matters is how much pure alcohol is consumed per unit of time (assuming you&#x27;re not actually drinking something stronger than 60% at an unnaturally high rate). Shotting hard liquor is a strong outlier - but sipping doesn&#x27;t have to be. I find that drinks and strong beers generally end up being about the same -- if you drink at a natural pace, and no water on the side, you&#x27;ll get drunk -- slow down and drink at least as much water (in volume) as alcohol and you&#x27;ll be fine. Personal tolerance/degree of alcoholism will vary from person to person, of course. Adjust to what pace suits <i>you</i>.<p>We can say 0.5l/500ml of 5% beer ~ 25ml of alcohol. If we calculate 5 glasses to a bottle of wine, a glass of 13% wine is 750ml/5 = 150ml ~ 19.5ml of alcohol. This happens to be about the same as a pint of 4.5% (455*0.045) -- but it&#x27;s more concentrated.<p>Might want to add two glasses of water to each glass of wine. Uptake will be a bit slower without gas in the mix.",1440100904

Tech companies often try to pretend this isn&#x27;t reality, but after you&#x27;ve been trading on the public markets for a while reality starts to set in hard.<p>So for Twitter to be a legit business valued at $18.5 billion (as it is today) they need to consistently churn out around $1.5 billion a year in pure hard core profit.

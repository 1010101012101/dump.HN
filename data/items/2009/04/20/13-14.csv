Sun is a major backer [...]""</i><p>Actually, that's incorrect; Sun is <i>a</i> backer, but hardly a major one.<p>A quick glance at Ohloh's contribution metrics for PostgreSQL (<a href=""http://www.ohloh.net/p/postgres/contributors/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ohloh.net/p/postgres/contributors/</a>) shows 17 committers with over 100 commits. If you start matching nicks up to the PostgreSQL contributor profiles (<a href=""http://www.postgresql.org/community/contributors/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.postgresql.org/community/contributors/</a>), you'll quickly see that only one, Peter Eisentraut, works for Sun.<p>Actually, it's interesting to note that of those 17 top contributors <i>not a single company</i> employs more that <i>one</i> top contributor.<p>If anything this is good news for PostgreSQL, then: Oracle can easily acquire and steer the course of MySQL development, but shifting PostgreSQL priorities by financial means would take the acquisition of Sun, IBM, UC Berkeley, and over a dozen more companies.",1240235818

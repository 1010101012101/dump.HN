Effectively, the investment banks were under-pricing the shares such that the company going public &quot;left money on the table&quot;, which got picked up (at relatively low risk) by the i-banks&#x27; preferred clients.<p>Companies seem to have grown wise to this and started putting more pressure on the i-banks to ensure they don&#x27;t end up leaving money on the table (c.f. Facebook, Pure Storage). Therefore, the i-banks&#x27; favoured clients are less interested in taking IPO allocations, so the i-banks need to widen the net to find more investor demand.<p>1: <a href=""http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB108328345314098183"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB108328345314098183</a><p>2: <a href=""http://www.cnbc.com/2014/08/19/es-took-off-but-the-auction-didnt.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cnbc.com/2014/08/19/es-took-off-but-the-auction-d...</a>",1445605114

The more champion based a race is (one male per many females), the more energy is going to be spent on competition. The offspring will also have to depend solely on the mother, since each child is just one of many from a single male and has thus less individual investment value.<p>The alternative strategy is to focus on a smaller number of children, making sure that that the reproductive investment has a higher chance to be successful. Children gets the value of having two parents that are invested in the offspring, but there are issues of &quot;cheating&quot; (an observed behavior in many animals).<p>Of course, I am only describing male strategy here and naturally it can not exist in a vacuum. Female strategy often has higher initial cost, but it does not dictate the outcome. In the case of humans also, the observed strategy in both sexes is normally said to be a mix strategy, so it is far more complex than just saying that the male genetic upside to risk is limited by the number of women they can have sex with.",1445604435

Could one answer lie in a return to the state monopolies of old?&quot;<p>&quot;consider jeans. Once there was only one kind, says Schwartz – the ill-fitting sort that, fingers-crossed, would get less ill-fitting once he wore and washed them repeatedly. Now, what with all the options (stone-washed, straight-leg, boot-fit, distressed, zip fly, button fly, slightly distressed, very distressed, knee-holed, thigh-holed, knee and thigh-holed, pretty much all holes and negligible denim), Schwartz feels entitled to expect that there is a perfect pair of jeans for him. Inevitably, though, when he leaves the store, he is likely to be less satisfied now than when there were hardly any options.&quot;<p>&quot;Corbyn’s political philosophy suggests, what we need is not more choice, but less; not more competition but more monopolies.&quot;",1445603021

It&#x27;s survivability was questioned even then, and given what we now know about the threat environment, it&#x27;s likely it would have suffered tremendously. [1]<p>Now, in the 1980s, there was a growing idea that it was feasible to stop a conventional attack [2] but this was a new an untested idea. Doctrine still called for tactical nuclear weapons against Soviet bridgeheads as being the only way to assuredly offset the numerical disadvantage.<p>But that&#x27;s all tactical. Part of the reason there were simply so many warheads built was to account for attrition and failure. There were real concerns about the inability for nuclear weapons to reach their targets. Having 5 bombs did not assuredly mean 5 cities destroyed. Bombers and cruise missiles could be shot down, ballistic missiles intercepted, and submarines sunk. That&#x27;s not to mention that, with testing (relatively) limited after 1963, there were reliability concerns regarding a weapon&#x27;s ability to detonate after delivery (especially with regard to shocks.)<p>So the solution for the U.S. and the USSR (others turned to more elaborate means [3]) was to simply throw more warheads, on more platforms, in a variety of ways, to ensure that regardless of whether or not this was a first strike, counterforce, etc, weapons would get through in quantity.

The classic example is that if you export potatoes and import cars, this is economically equivalent to finding a way to grow cars in a field.<p>In practice trade and technology have always been closely related. When China could make silk and Italy could make glass, trade was very obviously a substitute for the technology.<p>So basically, it makes a lot of sense to treat advancements in trade and technologies similarly in our thinking. Luddite ideas and economic isolationist ideas are in this sense different flavors of the same reaction by those made redundant.<p>Personally, I don&#x27;t buy &quot;robots wil take all jobs&quot; wholesale. There&#x27;s a lot of guesses in there we don&#x27;t have a rational way of making. We need to remember the many incarnations of Ned Ludd though time, including eminent figures like Ghandi.

The work in a 1850 factory and an 1875 factory was not different to the same extent as 1990-2015. People with 1990 skills now are not employable today in many/most fields. If that condenses further as I think it will, many people will fail to stay employable from 18-65, which means more unemployment.<p>I think we also need to consider some points Marx was fairly right about, the inevitability of political instability as a result of certain economic realities.

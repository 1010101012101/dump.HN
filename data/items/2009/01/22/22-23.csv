""Rock Star"" programmers, or programmers who at least have that ""Rock Star"" mentality, are clever enough to realize that doing a shitty job on a project they openly dislike means in the future they won't have to work on projects they dislike.<p>Due to their ""Rock Star"" mentality they can rationalize this poor work ethic because they truly believe they are benefiting everyone: ""it's far better for me to kick ass with the XYZ project then to do this crappy ABC project""<p>Trust me, I've been in that position (rock star).  There's something more to ""rock star"" than just passion... they are aware of their rock star status.<p>IMO, rock star programmers are good if you can handle them.  You need to make them believe that what they are working on is of the utmost importance that <i>they specifically</i> were assigned it precisely because of it's importance and because of their capability.  That's the best motivation for a rock star.<p>Otherwise I agree with TomOfTTB:  some rock stars, but more drones.",1232664957

Even within departments you will have a variety of experiences, and knowing what you want well in advance is key. Here are some observations about advisers (if you change your mind and end up applying for a PhD program):<p>- Young professors generally are trying to build their name in the community and will work you like no other. You will probably publish often. Stress is common.<p>- Middle-aged professors at the height of their career will generally be not available to you.  This is when they travel to conferences and meetings. Your <i>real</i> adviser will probably be your Post-Doc.<p>- Retirement-bound professors will be freely available and have a wealth of experience through which you can draw upon. They generally care less about department politics and more about your personal happiness and success.  However, they probably won't pressure you as often to get things done (may be good or bad).",1232663622

This is an area co-founded by Professor Leiserson. So, in fact, the first context in which I met Professor Leiserson was him giving a talk about cache oblivious algorithms at WADS '99 in Vancouver I think. Yeah, that has to be an odd year. So, I learned about cache oblivious algorithms then, started working in the area, and it's been a fun place to play. But this topic in some sense was also developed in the context of this class. I think there was one semester, probably also '98-'99 where all of the problem sets were about cache oblivious algorithms.""</i><p><a href=""http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Electrical-Engineering-and-Computer-Science/6-046JFall-2005/VideoLectures/detail/embed24.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Electrical-Engineering-and-Compute...</a>",1232662100

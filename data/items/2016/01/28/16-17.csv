10989381,comment,10983840,10988235,0,0,lmm,,,"It&#x27;s not a great situation yeah - I&#x27;d heard there was some effort on Ocaml multimedia libraries but I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s happened to that. Mozilla appear to have got some of their video stack implemented in rust but nowhere near the range of what ffmpeg supports. Hopefully in a few years we&#x27;ll get there, but in the meantime there&#x27;s no way around running <i>some</i> C code.<p>Even so, I would (and have) still use an FFI and put as much as possible in a safer language. You will get segfaults and memory leaks because you&#x27;re still calling C code, but you won&#x27;t be adding more, and IME that&#x27;s well worth the overhead of an FFI. (Also ffmpeg has had quite a bit of attention from people using valgrind, afl-fuzz etc, so its defect rate is lower than your C code would likely have, unless you&#x27;re also using those tools). Alternatively, depending on your use case you might be able to separate the decoding/encoding stages from the processing, in which case you can write the code without needing much in the way of libraries, and pipe to/from ffmpeg.<p>Write a quick prototype and see if you can get the performance you need within GC or a small amount of -XXasdf (you might be surprised, particularly with the state of Haskell and OCaml today. I&#x27;ve done literally this from Java, JNI-ing the ffmpeg libraries to do realtime streaming, and had it work fine, and that was five years ago). In the rare case something like that doesn&#x27;t cut it Rust is what I&#x27;d use (there are other options but I know less about them).",1454000381

10989363,comment,10979220,10979220,0,0,panglott,,,"Isn&#x27;t it normal to have difficulty focusing on things that are really boring?<p>ADHD diagnosis rates are several times higher in the US than in other developed countries, and orders of scale higher than in low-diagnosis countries (such as France). The biggest risk factors for an ADHD diagnoses include things like &quot;being male&quot; and &quot;being in the youngest quartile of your kindergarten class&quot;. That&#x27;s an amazing thing to pathologize. In the US, the drive to perform well on standardized tests has gotten to such an extreme that kindergarteners are expected to have literacy performance that was expected of 1st-graders a generation ago, and children are expected to <i>come</i> to kindergarten with the alphabet knowledge that they would have learned in kindergarten a generation ago. Meanwhile, the amount of time young children have spent at recess has declined hugely in the last 30 years, with very many schools having no recess at all.<p>Isn&#x27;t there a margin where this is a disorder because of the interaction between an individual and their environment, where the environment is the problem?<p>Some amount of ADHD-spectrum behavior might should be considered within the range of normal child development, which is being pathologized by a system that doesn&#x27;t give young children (especially slightly younger boys) enough exercise. The main treatment for ADHD is lifelong amphetamine use, and nobody can say whether this treatment prevents children from developing coping mechanisms that they would otherwise normally develop before adulthood.<p>If something as simple as more exercise can marginally reduce ADHD diagnosis or medication rates, that would be a huge advance.",1454000266

It took me two more years however to finish it. The journey was, since that time until yesterday, a nightmare. While I wrote down and tested every idea I had to push back depression, the illness itself still crawled in me, making me doubt myself, erase stuff, making my progress painfully slow, and even pushing me to have thoughts of suicide. I want to enjoy writing and somehow make this my daily job, but the process of trying to make a book that in my mind I knew would net me practically(or exactly) cero profit and that no one would read truly hurt and broke my heart. Don&#x27;t think i&#x27;m saying i don&#x27;t want to write unless I get money, it&#x27;s just we all have bills to pay.<p>The reason I&#x27;m writing here today is to tell you that no matter what is it you want to do in your life, it&#x27;s always possible to find a way to do it. It may take years, breakdowns, tears, ideas of giving up or, in my case, dying, but it is never impossible. Now, is it worth it? I don&#x27;t know. I personally acomplished my dream of writing a book and that means so much, but I&#x27;m not sure much has changed apart from that. I&#x27;ll keep writing and see what happens.<p>Anyway, it all started years ago when I read here a blog post incentivizing people to write. Months later here I was, asking how to self-publish. So thank you everyone for your kindness and answers, even if writing a comment takes a couple meaningless seconds, it means a lot to me.<p>In any case, proof of the book. It&#x27;s not perfect, but I did my best.<p>http://www.amazon.com/Overcoming-Depression-Powerful-Changes-Happy-ebook/dp/B01B3ZA2MQ/<p>I hope to see this post in a couple years and be proud of myself of how far i&#x27;ve come...

Chicago is like any other major US city, probably better than the mid-tier cities I&#x27;ve spent time living in in terms of police and crime.  It&#x27;s simply very much two cities and you only hear news stories about one.<p>Just like anywhere else, don&#x27;t act like an idiot or seek out trouble in rough areas and 99% of your interactions with police will be fine.<p>You&#x27;re on HackerNews so presumably you make money and won&#x27;t be living on the South Side or somewhere like it.  If you&#x27;re living in Lincoln Park, Wicker Park, Streeterville, etc. you will likely never witness a bad police interaction the entire time you live there - unless you go looking for it.  Live in some of the more marginal neighborhoods and those you fear will almost assuredly not be the police.<p>It&#x27;s like anywhere else - dressed like a young professional, out with other similar friends, not being confrontational and get caught doing a minor infraction?  You&#x27;ll be warned and maybe yelled at.  Do the same acting like fools and giving attitude back?  Yeah, you might be taught a lesson and spend the night in jail.<p>I&#x27;ve had plenty of interactions with CPD between myself and my drunk friends in my earlier days.  The cops acted just like you would expect and desire them to in all but one situation.  That situation was a friend jumping a security gate on the El to photograph some train stuff.  He went to jail for the night.<p>As with everything like this the hyperbole is just nuts.  If you&#x27;re a poor minority living on the South Side my answer may be different, but for the typical Hackernews frequenter Chicago is no different than NYC or LA, and honestly in terms of &quot;living in the city&quot; you are likely to find far safer and wealthy neighborhoods than you will in the &quot;inner city&quot; of any other mid-tier NFL town in the US.<p>That said it&#x27;s a big city.  If you&#x27;re used to living in a big city, Chicago is just another one with better than normal public transit.  Same problems and concerns as anywhere else.  You can find neighborhoods that have similar crime rates to the most wealthy suburbs there are, and neighborhoods with a higher homicide rate than Iraq.

If an admin creates an event for 4pm, we save 4pm with the event location&#x27;s timezone. Since an event only takes place at one specific location, it makes no sense to have the data in UTC in the database. We can convert to UTC if we want but it&#x27;s not really useful. The thinking is that if a client is shopping for a class in a different timezone, why would we convert the class&#x27;s time to the client&#x27;s timezone? It makes no sense.

In case you have an embedded system that is not connected to the internet all the time, how can that processes be put in place to make sure it is updated?<p>A decade or so ago, nothing updated, and when DST changed, you had to reset every clock in the house. There was maybe a day or two of confusion where you couldn&#x27;t remember if you changed a clock or not, but easily dealt with.<p>Now, in my house anyway, <i>almost</i> everything automatically switches (with the notable exception of my stove and microwave clocks, but heck, those still don&#x27;t even have battery backup for when the power flickers). This is probably even more annoying, because now it&#x27;s not a matter of remembering if <i>I</i> switched it (in the last day or so) or not, it&#x27;s remembering if the <i>device itself switches automatically</i> or not. I can&#x27;t remember stuff like that, so basically for a day or two after DST I don&#x27;t trust any clocks at all.<p>Worse is when the devices still have the old (pre-2007) DST rules built-in. We&#x27;re lucky in NA that the rules don&#x27;t change <i>that</i> much, but when they do, they do break all these old devices. The most annoying item I had (notice past tense) was a beside clock that auto-set itself I believe based on the WWV [1] signal, and had a setting for time-zone and would of course do DST shifts automatically. Pretty neat, when I first got it, but after 2007, I had to manually change the timezone on this &quot;auto-setting clock&quot; 4 times a year.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWV_(radio_station)"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWV_(radio_station)</a>",1453999118

Users could flip running apps into edit mode at any time, to customize, built and script their own user interfaces at runtime.<p>It was implemented, scripted and rendered in NeWS with PostScript code and graphics, and included direct manipulation GUI editing tools, an Adobe Illustrator like PostScript graphics editor, warehouses of preconfigured customizable components, a client/server networking library, plus an object oriented C to PostScript compiler he wrote called PdB (for Pure dead Brilliant). [1]<p>(From my earlier post [2], which includes more details and lots of links, screen shots and manuals):<p>>At the Turing Institute in Glasgow, Arthur and his colleagues created a groundbreaking HyperCard-like PostScript-based networked user interface creation tool called GoodNeWS, later renamed HyperNeWS and then HyperLook, which was the most amazing thing anyone ever did with NeWS.<p>>HyperLook was so far ahead of its time in 1989, that there still isn&#x27;t anything quite like it for modern technology. Since we developed HyperLook and SimCity at the same time, that forced us to eat our own dog food, and ensure that HyperLook supported everything you needed to develop real world applications. (Not to imply that SimCity is a real world! ;)<p>After Arthur left Sun to form Marimba and publish Castanet, he also wrote a little-known and under-appreciated Java scriptable HyperCard-like system called Bongo [3], which distributed interactive content via Castanet &quot;channels&quot;, and had the important ability that was present in HyperCard and HyperLook but missing in HotJava: attaching and evaluating scripts on objects at runtime, by virtue of calling the Java compiler at runtime. (Having written the Java compiler himself, it was easy for Arthur to figure out how call it and dynamically link in the compiled byte code at runtime, a feat that is necessary for implementing HyperCard-like interactive programming tools, was unheard of at the time (not even HotJava did that), but is now taken for granted today with JavaScript. ;)<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avJnpDKHxPY&index=30&list=PLX66BqHq0qTCvsWWrjptBUdHnzItlelrE"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avJnpDKHxPY&index=30&list=PL...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8546507"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8546507</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://people.apache.org/~jim/NewArchitect/webtech/1997/10/note/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://people.apache.org/~jim/NewArchitect/webtech/1997/10/...</a>",1453998747

For example, I love the convenience of buying a book on my Kindle, but I&#x27;m reminded of the joy of wandering through my grandparents&#x27; library and wonder if my daughter (and so on) will be able to have a similar experience – what happens to those my Amazon purchases after I&#x27;m gone? Another example is that I keep a sporadic journal in Evernote. Should I really be printing out those writings in case I have a curious descendant? I&#x27;ve enjoyed reading letters and journals of ancestors.<p>On the other hand, digitalization has obvious benefits too. But we have to be deliberate in our curation and storage format.<p>For example, it&#x27;s great that correspondence (email) is now automatically archived rather than it being a tedious process (carbon copy, hand-copying, etc.). But how many people backup their email out of their cloud provider to a personally owned copy in a human-readable format? I actually do backup my Gmail account occasionally. But I doubt my wife knows where it is. Or if she&#x27;d be able to look past the XML format.

10989121,comment,10982594,10988359,0,0,mcguire,,,"<i>Duck and cover! Rant incoming! Remember: Face down, ass to the blast!</i><p>Here&#x27;s a fun fact: Anyone can give out any degree they like. You can do it. I&#x27;ve done it; heck, I&#x27;m a Ph.D. granting institution. (And I thought the diploma turned out rather attractive.) But it&#x27;ll be worth approximately the price of a piece of used printer paper.<p>A Ph.D. in particular consists of three different things:<p>* An academic degree awarded by an appropriate educational institution. This is the <i>least</i> important part. It&#x27;s worth is dependant only on the reputation of the institution for excellence in the other two bits. Saying &quot;I took classes for a PhD&quot; is pretty meaningless---that has nothing to do with the other two facets, and in most well-regarded programs the classes are only there to provide background that you may have missed before getting into the program, for introducing you to the more advanced parts of the topic, and for introducing you to the faculty you may want on your committee. In fact, grades are seriously inflated. If you get less than a B, you must have done something pretty terrible to fail. Killing your professor&#x27;s dog terrible. Saying &quot;I wrote a dissertation for a PhD&quot; is almost as bad. No one cares about the dissertation, other than that you have to write it. The only requirements from the institution are that it be formatted properly and turned in to the appropriate Dean&#x27;s office before the deadline. (Something that most grad students fail at at least once.)<p>* A program of training for becoming a professor. You should be able to lecture without embarrassing yourself. You should be able to write an academic paper without embarrassing your co-authors. And you should be able to write grant proposals without embarrassing your employing institution. (These same set of skills are required for industrial research, in a modified form, as well as for academic jobs.) In practice, this is the <i>most important</i> facet, although in theory it should be second.<p>* And finally, the only part that <i>really counts</i>, although it is less important in current practice: Preparation for and a demonstration of the fact that you can conduct a successful research program that adds to the totality of human knowledge. This is what a PhD is.[1] A demonstration to whom, you may ask. (An excellent question!) You demonstrate your ability to a group of your new peers: other PhDs. Specifically, a group of faculty members and possibly other PhDs from outside the institution. Think of it like getting a black belt[2] or having a professional Go rating[3]: you get it for convincing others who already have it that you&#x27;re worthy. How do you demonstrate it? You pick a topic with the aid of an advisor (more or less aid; there&#x27;s many styles here), do the research working with your advisor and your committee (more or less (ahem)), produce papers describing the research, go to conferences, etc., and then write a dissertation describing your research program (that no one will ever read). Finally, you defend your research, somewhat like playing king-of-the-hill: your committee and other interested parties try to poke holes in you and your research in a public forum. That&#x27;s it. When you convince them, you&#x27;re done.<p>This is why I don&#x27;t have a lot of sympathy with that Area 51 guy who said he has a PhD from MIT but that a government conspiracy is covering everything up. You cannot get through that last part without leaving many, many publicly visible footprints. Certainly not from MIT.<p>Likewise, you can get a PhD diploma from anyone, anywhere. But if you didn&#x27;t go through that process, you may have a PhD but you don&#x27;t have a PhD.<p>Note: I&#x27;m only familiar with the process in the US, and in STEM fields. But I think it&#x27;s generally applicable. YMMV.<p>[1] <a href=""http://matt.might.net/articles/phd-school-in-pictures/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://matt.might.net/articles/phd-school-in-pictures/</a><p>[2] It&#x27;s been a long time since I practised any martial arts.

Enough so that they are lowering their life expectancy.  They have a need for water, not soda.  Soda is worse, comparable to slightly dirty water in how it impacts their life expectancy, but they choose it for other reasons.<p>It would be far easier to give people money and let them choose how to allocate it.  If someone&#x27;s immediate needs is a safer location to shelter in then they can decide what do they need less (maybe reduce their food budget to compensate).

The 2x4 studs typical of stick-built construction are now cut from fast-growing trees of relatively small diameter, such that you can see the curvature in the grain at the end of the stud, the grain is mostly parallel to the longer dimension, it&#x27;s full of knots, and it changes shape whenever the humidity level changes.  You just can&#x27;t squeeze a good 2x4 out of an 8&quot; diameter log, no matter how you try to cut it.<p>And yet the overwhelming majority of new single-family homes are still built with wooden 2x4 studs.  This is one reason why doors start sticking in their frames after only a few years since a new house was built.<p>A lot of this is driven by local building codes that will not adapt to newer building methods.  There are better, more cost-efficient ways to build houses, and people are literally forbidden from using them.  Manufactured homes are instead ruled by the HUD building codes and inspectors, so building something off-site and trucking it in may be the only way to get a home with a particular construction method in a given place.",1453997970

All these <i>foo-dev</i> packages\ncontaining static libraries and headers, and <i>foo</i> packages with actual\nlibraries and tools, either having their respective dependencies (e.g.\n<i>foo-dev</i> depending on gcc, so you&#x27;ll get compiler by just running `apt-get\ninstall foo-dev&#x27;).<p>Apache is not a good choice for development tool. It&#x27;s not pretty to set up\na second instance that runs without root privileges. I use uWSGI for those,\nI just use different communication protocols for production (FastCGI or\nuWSGI&#x27;s own thing) and development (HTTP, to avoid setting up fully blown web\nserver).<p>Running `npm install&#x27; or `bower install&#x27; or `pip install&#x27; to just set up your\nenvironment is a method for a big stall in case of network outage (see this\nthread: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10984775"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10984775</a>), unless you prepare\nlocal caches for <i>all these repositories</i>.

I&#x27;m happy that you can see the positives in Nim even though you dislike one of its most prominent features.<p>Personally I love significant whitespace and have started using Nim because of this feature, basically back in the day I just wanted a Python alternative that was compiled. If you really dislike it that much, you may be able to convince Araq to bring back his old time idea of allowing different syntaxes in Nim. As for a gofmt tool: `nim pretty` exists but may need to mature a bit.<p>I believe that a focus on web development is good. One of the reasons why the book has such a strong focus on it is because I have spent most of my time implementing stuff which is necessary for web dev in Nim, and I want to show it off. The fact that I have a lot of experience with it helps too.<p>I would love to show off as many things as I can, and I might look into including some examples of SDL, SFML, and more as well as ways to utilise Nim&#x27;s real-time GC for games. But I must be careful, the book is already becoming rather large :)<p>As for systems, there is a whole chapter dedicated to Direct Hardware Control in the book. But I will make a note of maybe including something for native desktop developers.<p>In terms of the GC, I don&#x27;t have as much experience using Nim with no GC as I would like. So I can&#x27;t really comment as to the current situation.<p>In terms of a comparison to D, I&#x27;ve already received feedback to add D to the language comparison table in Chapter 1. To compare these properly I will need to do some research first.<p>Nim is very close to 1.0 now. We are planning on looking at the standard library and ensuring that it is in tip top shape before 1.0 is finally released. There is also work currently happening to make asynchronous IO multithreaded.<p>Thanks for the feedback and hope this answers your questions!",1453996874

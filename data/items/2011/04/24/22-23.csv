So what, we remove it from the pool and provision another.<p>Only our master and our slave backup server runs on EBS.  We aren't as write oriented so we can live with some of the limitations of EBS, but we've even considered moving our master MySQL and Mongo servers to ephemeral storage and just relying on our slave back database server to run on EBS (for which we take freeze/snapshots of often).  That server rarely ever falls more behind in relay updates.",1303685840

2479831,comment,2478532,2478535,1,0,FrojoS,,,"Thanks! Very interesting. From the WP article:<p>""Martin Ford author of The Lights in the Tunnel: Automation, Accelerating Technology and the Economy of the Future [6] makes the case that the risk posed by accelerating technology may be primarily economic in nature. Ford argues that before technology reaches the point where it represents a physical existential threat, it will become possible to automate nearly all routine and repetitive jobs in the economy.""<p>I find this, for short or medium time scales, quite likely, too. There will always be a demand for high skilled humans. Maybe even after the machines are the new bosses. But if we don't make groundbreaking progress in human learning techniques, most people will have trouble to learn these skills fast enough.<p>Then he writes further:<p>""In the absence of a major reform to the capitalist system, this could result in massive unemployment, plunging consumer spending and confidence, and an economic crisis potentially even more severe than the Great Depression. If such a crisis were to occur, subsequent technological progress would dramatically slow because there would be insufficient incentive to invest in innovation.""<p>This sounds somewhat plausible but I don't believe it. The trend goes towards highly profitable mega corporations. Governments, and with it most people, become less powerful in economic terms. I think we can already see this effect very well. So there won't necessary be a recession. As long as the rich find ways to spend their money - like flying to Mars.",1303685549

YMMV.<p>RWH’s “Here’s how you get the job done” style exposition did a reasonably good job of making me feel comfortable turning on profiling of my Haskell programs, but didn’t give me much sense at all of why the particular examples they chose were particularly representative of space leaks. I went on to do some amount of performance tuning of some data structures <a href=""http://blog.ezyang.com/2010/03/the-case-of-the-hash-array-mapped-trie/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.ezyang.com/2010/03/the-case-of-the-hash-array-ma...</a> ... but I still managed to miss some really obvious performance bugs that Tibell caught later when he revamped my benchmarks <a href=""http://blog.johantibell.com/2011/03/video-of-my-hashing-based-containers.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.johantibell.com/2011/03/video-of-my-hashing-base...</a> .

I found it hard to read. (Which is terrible, since it's a wiki, and if I don't like it, I should improve the article...) Exactly why is hard to pinpoint. It might be statements like ""Haskell values are highly layered""; it might be the fact that none of the examples are in motion (they don’t show before-and-after; the actual operation of the program!); it might be that in many respects, its coverage is incomplete.<p>Obviously, this series isn’t going to be the be-all, end-all reference for laziness. While it would be extremely gratifying to see other people take up the ghosts and presents metaphor, I’ll be content if people walk away with a sort of visceral feeling about all the churning that goes on under the hood when they write a functional program, so that it’s <i>not</i> surprising when a trace statement shows up much later than you expect it and so that it’s <i>not</i> a matter of trial-and-error inserting bang-fields and seqs.",1303684372

And the whitest of them all are the BSD-like licenses, which are frowned upon by the FSF.<p>And the reason I think proprietary software is like marijuana is because you CAN be careful when using it, you can also take it in small dosages where it makes sense, you're only required to use it responsibly to not end up hooked with freedoms lost.<p>And of course, for some people marijuana usage turns into heroin -- but everybody fears heroin and heroin comes with a heafty price for the junkies, which isn't that good in the eyes of consumers (best things in life tend to be cheap ;))<p>Also, leaving this analogy behind -- let's take as example GIMP.<p>Gimp is awesome for what it does and I actually think its grotesque interface is the reason why I ended up working with masks, really groking effects like smart-sharpening.<p>But if you're deep into photography, using Gimp is unacceptable. First, it has serious limitations like 8-bits per color (which means you're losing color info, when importing from RAW formats, or when composing layers -- and as a practical consequence, correcting over/under-exposed photos becomes a nightmare). CMYK support is hackish at best, and photographers (professional or passionate amateurs) do print their photos (whether it's for selling, or for doing exhibits). Then, while the UI forces you to learn about the inner-workings of digital image processing, it becomes a pain in the ass to quickly retouch hundreds of photos (unless you can do them as a batch, with some scripting, but since every photo is unique, no, you can't).<p>So comparing a product like Adobe Photoshop, which provides real/measurable value to photographers, with a drug that you can get rid of -- that's stretching it a lot. I also view a product like Photoshop as something that gives you more freedom for expression -- also saving you bucks which you'd spend otherwise on extremely high-priced gear.",1303683857

Maybe I'm just not in your target market, but this component doesn't solve any problem I have.  Seeing a bunch of dots that change places every time I zoom in is visually jarring and not very helpful.  Only in rare circumstances would I prefer this visualization over seeing all the pins.<p>Now if you did a heatmap-type visualization, or had something that crossed over more smoothly between ""wide angle"" and ""close up"" zooms, I would be interested--that's actually a problem I would pay something for.  But I would be more interested in seeing the component large-format:  iPad or Mac or Web.  Dashboard-type visualizations to monitor global infrastructure or something.  Because people aren't going to do a ten-inch pinch on a phone, they just want to see the ten coffee shops on this street, and notation groups aren't needed for that.  But I might want to visualize the whole world's tweets on a ginormous zoomable kiosk or do it in a presentation or a dashboard of my customers or something.<p>Quite frankly I'm happy to pay for a UI component but I want the vendor to have put in the time and effort to think about the UI so that I don't have to.  All the iOS APIs have a lot of thought put into the UI (pages and pages of rationale in the documentation), and for a premium component that's your entry bar.  Grouped annotations sounds like the way I would initially try to solve this problem, would prototype it and realize that it didn't work, and then try heatmaps.  Maybe heatmaps won't be an effective metaphor either.  The value a good premium component has on iOS is NOT that it's a cheaper component, but it takes out a lot of design risk, a lot of bad prototypes.  The point is, I'm willing to pay great money for a great UI, and no money for a mediocre one.<p>The problem with your pricing is that the binary people will need more support from you than the source code people (who can fix the problem themselves, and optionally send you a patch).  You need to price a few hours of support into the low-end product especially, so $150 is too cheap.

But I suppose they serve a few other purposes than fund raising. Scouts potentially learn life skills about working and business instead of how to beg for money with tangible benefits for the troop.

The Falcon Heavy is supposed to be 6 times cheaper per ton to LEO than the Delta IV Heavy. This can save the US government as well as many companies around the world lots of money.<p>Second, the ability to jump in, just when the, expensive, shuttle program runs out seems to be very helpful for the USA as a - if not the - space nation.

No, they wanted to be astronauts since they were little boys, more than anything else in the world! This is pure speculation, but if NASA would auction their astronaut positions to people who match the minimum requirements, they might be profitable tomorrow.<p>Same goes for Elon Musk and Mars.

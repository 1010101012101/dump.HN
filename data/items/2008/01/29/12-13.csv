I am baffled by the fact that people get so worked up about general elections.  Yes, the outcome will have a profound effect upon one's life, but that outcome is almost entirely outside one's control.<p>My own preference is for much more power to be given to local governments, and for consensus-based decision making, rather than voting.

The point is you can run OS X only on Mac hardware.<p>This argument has been going on forever, of course.  But that doesn't mean it doesn't make sense.  It would be nice if you could run OS X on any old cheap hardware you chose, rather than the overpriced machines made by one company.  That's the normal state of affairs for virtually every other OS people care about.",1201609898

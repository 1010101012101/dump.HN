4300431,comment,4298100,4299895,3,0,btilly,,,"Here is a simple example of how to automate this for developers.<p>Everyone who applies is sent a link.  That link contains a problem description, and a stub program.  You're supposed to write the program and send it back.  When you send it back, they compile your program and run a standard set of unit tests on it.  If it passes the unit tests, then a human looks at it.  Generally the code will be ""good enough"" to bring the person in for an interview.<p>In the interview you will ask the person enough questions about their solution to give you confidence that the person you are interviewing actually wrote the code you are reviewing.  This greatly shortens the interview process.<p>This is not a hypothetical approach.  I know of more than one company that has actually implemented this.<p>You might think that it takes a lot of developer time to implement, but it doesn't.  What you do is have a developer come up with a reasonable project that they think can be done in a reasonable amount of time.  That developer then solves the problem.  You take their solution and stub it out - that gives you the initial stubs people can download.  The unit tests that they developed are the unit tests that you will use.  And now you're off and running.",1343374931

* To a lesser extent, so does sunburn.
* Finding somewhere comfortable to sit in shade is crucial, and harder than you'd think, and lying is out (appealing though it may be).
* The ideal place to work was a beachside bar, without standing pools of water close by (attracting mosquitoes), that was quiet, serving coffee and wifi. Often hard to find, though.
* Lack of wifi was sometimes a plus, provided it was never too far away. It's easier to focus on coding without Internet access.<p>In the end, my favorite tropical location to write code in was Singapore. The beach is overrated :)",1343374729

I believe that unions should be somewhat antagonistic to keep the labor market a bit dynamic (so progress can be made); too much harmony is a big warning sign in many societies.<p>Speaking of such, Japan was big into factory robotics up until the mid-90s, when they took a break to take advantage of China coming online and the cheap labor that came with that. Its crazy how China set robotics back by about 10 or so years. With Chinese labor becoming more expensive, I'm sure we'll see more progress; not to mention domestic bots, in-the-field bots, and drones.<p>However, this is a good question: how to deal with surplus labor that gets displaced by robots?

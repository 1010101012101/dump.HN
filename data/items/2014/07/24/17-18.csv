This podcast ebbs and flows in a beautiful way that allows me to <i>zone in</i> on only the thing I&#x27;m doing.<p>I tried a few times to describe it just now, but I feel like all of my descriptions to a bad job. It often has electronic elements, but it isn&#x27;t exclusively that and it isn&#x27;t upbeat or fast. It isn&#x27;t trance or &quot;chill&quot; like, say Groove Salad on SomaFM is. Sometimes there is a quiet mix of Apollo radio chatter mixed in, sometimes it is a woman&#x27;s voice whispering that she doesn&#x27;t love you. Altogether the tracks nail that perfect point of being interesting enough to keep you awake, but soft enough that you don&#x27;t get distracted. It is like white_noise++;<p>Some episodes/tracks are better than others (I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll find your favorites), but I find the overall quality fantastic.",1406224748

These stores are the best channel for taking the pulse of the market. It&#x27;s very hard to see a company maintaining its brand and evolving with the market with what basically amounts to a franchise-only play.<p>It&#x27;s worth noting that Chipotle, which does not currently franchise, is absolutely killing it from both a financial standpoint[1] and a customer experience standpoint[2]. Burger King&#x27;s model has an attractive financial profile (for now) but according to the same recent Consumer Reports survey that gave Chipotle top marks in its category, Burger King received one of the worst marks for burgers.<p>More interestingly, based on a quick glance at the Consumer Reports rankings, it appears there may be a correlation between customer perception of product quality and the percentage of company stores. In Burger King&#x27;s category (burgers), the number two chain, In-N-Out, doesn&#x27;t franchise, and the number one chain, The Habit, just started franchising last year and is still relatively small. Food for thought, no pun intended.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.equities.com/editors-desk/stocks/consumer-discretionary/chipotle-rolls-up-some-fat-earnings"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.equities.com/editors-desk/stocks/consumer-discret...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://news.investors.com/business/070214-707190-mcdonalds-yum-lose-taste-test-chipotle-tops.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.investors.com/business/070214-707190-mcdonalds-y...</a>",1406224712

I switched to Java and work for enterprise now so we have our own servers but for the next hobby project I doubt it&#x27;ll be on Heroku.<p>The thing that pisses me off most is that Heroku&#x27;s policies on error/performance/updates are shaky, but their add-on makers (who are charging HIGH premiums) are far worse.<p>I&#x27;ve had such a shoddy experience with WebSolr for example. Every few months all their stuff breaks, then when you follow their instructions to spin your instance back up you find that the client API or instance type you use is no longer supported and have to debate which parts of your codebase to upgrade just to get back to where you started.<p>That&#x27;s why I think the Heroku ecosystem is trash -- after 1-2 years of forced upgrades and code refactoring you get so tired of it. &quot;Oh another email saying if I don&#x27;t change ___ in 6 months my app will die.&quot; &quot;Another slew of unexplained errors followed by Googling eventually leading to 1 tweet about how this add-ons service is temporarily f<i></i>ked&quot;.

I hate people who make this lie of ommission.  Harvard Extension isn&#x27;t Harvard College or Harvard Business School, but it still provides a very good education with great flexibility at an even better price.  However, there is a small minority of people that continuely try to pass off their degree (or in this case a lack of degree, which is an even bigger crime considering that both the admission and graduate rates of the College and Extension School are roughly inverses of each other) as something more than it is.  This isn&#x27;t a fabricated credential on a resume; it is a lie that makes other people guilty by association.  Everytime someone confesses or is caught doing this my degree becomes devalued.  It establishes a repuation for HES students and alumni as unethical Harvard wannabees that are looking for any way to cut corners.  The lesson to learn is not about managing your own reputation for ethics and honesty, but to also remember that you are a member of community.  You don&#x27;t only represent yourself.  You represent yourself, your company, your friends, your family, your school, your industry, your hometown, your gender, your race, your sexual preference...<p>Obligatory [semi-]relevant xkcd: <a href=""http://xkcd.com/385/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://xkcd.com/385/</a>",1406224677

People behave with much predictability and tend to behave consistently within the framework of their belief system. Within their own framework, they tend to behave rationally, even though it would appear irrational to one with an incompatible belief system.<p>Yes, emotional attachment to something will cause people to cling to it beyond its objective due, and that&#x27;s why UX is so important. You&#x27;re NOT going to persuade someone with information alone. You must make it accessible to them, which could involve all sorts of roundabout approaches, many of which may not even begin to offer any actual information until much later in the process (especially if you&#x27;re trying to undo damage).<p>Ultimately my point is this:<p>- People do not react exactly the same as their neighbor. You can&#x27;t make a one-size-fits-all solution and expect it to work.<p>- People tend act in a manner consistent with their belief system. There is a rationality to their thought process, even though emotions complicate things. But these complications are understood and have been studied extensively. The knowledge for how to deal with them exists.<p>- If you&#x27;re going to reach someone, you must first understand what that belief system is, and figure out how to offer knowledge in a non-threatening way.<p>In fact, this thread makes for a good microcosm of the problem. Some people immediately understood what I was getting at. They upvoted, or gave positive response. Others either did not understand, or perhaps I touched a nerve (negative emotional response), causing them to downvote. One even responded with &quot;It&#x27;s good to know that, yet again the fault does not lie with the common man. It is always someone else&#x27;s fault.&quot;, which is a pretty clear indication that my approach failed with him entirely. Pure information did not work, and in many ways my presentation of the information has been incomplete, as evidenced by yours and mine back-and-forth, culminating in &quot;It&#x27;s like you didn&#x27;t read what I wrote.&quot; (a clear indication that I failed to communicate with you effectively).<p>In fact, my first entry into this thread was filled with attack words, which likely put most people into a defensive frame of mind (especially if they originally agreed with the article).

Too many variables to get closer but 50% should cover all but the most extreme cases.<p>Simply open a savings account and park that 50% there right after you invoice. If you&#x27;re invoicing with GST/VAT/whatever it is called where you live then you get to subtract out the VAT first, then do the 50%, then add <i>all</i> the VAT back in and save that.",1406223879

In fact, judging from the number of popular, widely used open source projects reduced to begging for donations, it&#x27;s precisely the opposite. You may simply be assuming as true the same excuses that pirates use to justify their piracy, saying &quot;Hey, I&#x27;m giving you free advertising!&quot;, completely overlooking the fact that 1) advertising in itself does not feed the creators, and 2) they&#x27;re primarily advertising it to people just like them, who&#x27;ll also simply pirate the product.<p>Look at the companies making the most money in software. Then look at the companies making money from open source software. Note: <i>not</i> companies that use open source or open up some of their non-core code, but those whose primary product is open source, such as Red Hat. There&#x27;s a few orders of magnitude of difference in revenues. This despite Linux running the vast majority of servers on the Internet and in data centers. Why is this?<p>While open source proponents like to live in an ideal world where everybody shares their code and collaborates, the harsh truth is that the vast, vast majority of the world will take what it can and give nothing back.

But he seemed very intent on downplaying the service and focusing on App.Net as a platform. This is what caused all the confusion; most of the actual <i>users</i> of App.Net were primarily users of Alpha, and anyone who was creating a product with the App.Net platform were facing the confusion of people thinking that&#x27;s like creating a product with Twitter. I believe the reason Dalton did this was because his dream was for him to solely care about the platform and for other developers to provide all the apps. But nobody else was going to provide an Alpha clone, nor should they.<p>What Dalton really should have done was immediately spun off Alpha into its own full-fledged product. Give it a snappy name (heck, Alpha isn&#x27;t too bad, certainly better than App.Net), give it its own domain, and make it very clearly a distinct product from App.Net. Then he could brand it all he wants as &quot;built on top of App.Net&quot; or whatever, and having login, etc. go through the app.net domain, but ultimately it should have been immediately recognizable as what it was; a Twitter-like messaging service (with much better features), that was built on top of App.Net. Just like a third-party app would have been.<p>This would have made it much easier to understand. People talking about App.Net would be obviously talking about the platform, people talking about Alpha would be talking about the messaging service, and trying to encourage people to build new apps on top of the App.Net platform would have made far more sense than convincing people to build new apps on top of what they think is basically just a Twitter clone.",1406223123

Of course firing is a normal part of company operations - I stated that explicitly, multiple times in my post.<p><i>Mass</i> firing however, is not.<p>Hiring will be imperfect, no matter how hard we try. Once in a while someone bad <i>will</i> make it into the company, and it&#x27;s of great importance that the company identify and fire these people in a timely manner.<p>Note the last part: timely manner. Unless a company has been completely asleep at the wheel, there is no scenario under which people will suddenly go &quot;woah woah woah! these 200 people must go!&quot;. To let go of so many all at once suggests you either <i>weren&#x27;t</i> policing bad hires actively and let too many under-performers stick around for too long (and are just now getting around to cleaning house), and/or suggests a knee-jerk overreaction to some stimulus, and now you&#x27;re about to throw some baby out with the bathwater.<p>Firing is normal. Mass firings are not.<p>And your &quot;empiricism&quot; is backed by your own personal anecdotes. Funny. In any case, I agree that <i>individual</i> firings can be morale-neutral (never morale-positive, despite your claim). When you fire Bob, who&#x27;s been underperforming, only the people who work with Bob hear about it. Everyone knows Bob is hard to work with and not very good at his job, and people don&#x27;t feel threatened by Bob&#x27;s firing.<p>This isn&#x27;t true when you&#x27;re firing 200 people. People in the company hear about it, but they don&#x27;t know everyone on the list - in fact, they may not know <i>anyone</i> on the list. So now the &quot;obviousness&quot; of the firings isn&#x27;t so obvious, and people start wondering just how bad these people were to get fired, and they start wondering about their own performance. This is the start of a bad cycle, and morale is going to drop no matter which way you play it.<p>Firing 1 person has a tremendously different dynamic than firing 200 people.<p>So, we agree that firing people who can be saved is a good idea.

We have taken action on matters like this by passing laws that state parents must afford their children a basic right to information as it is presented by society.  Schools.<p>Given the Internet is causing a huge surge in the amount of information available for consumption (ignoring the opinionated bits), one would assume there wouldn&#x27;t need to be laws in place to force parents to this decision.  It simply takes care of itself because the child has nearly unfettered access to the information.  Granted it could be curated better, but whatever.<p>The real issue then becomes ensuring this information is readily available to anyone that desires it.  This desired outcome is only be affected by something along the lines of government (or terrorist) sponsored censorship and the current spat of anti-net neutrality arguments presented by big business.

It can be done, but it requires some hacks.<p>* There isn&#x27;t a huge community around it outside of Guidewire, the classic bootstrapping problem.<p>* The IDE support is in IntelliJ only and can be a bit of a bear to set up initially.<p>We do have a (very alpha) web microframework that you can use to play around with the language:<p><pre><code>  http://sparkgs.github.io/\n</code></pre>\nAnd we are hoping to address all these issues over the coming year, but it&#x27;s a long process to go from an internal language to a truly viable open source development platform if you don&#x27;t have the resources Google has to throw at it.",1406221813

You have to get buy-in for the ideas, presumably one idea at a time. You have to justify, in tangible and financial terms, what the cost/benefit of making the change will be -- especially because implementing <i>any</i> structural change will require a very large, very real cost up front. And the problem with one-idea-at-a-time is that each idea, in isolation, carries a high political risk, but less potential upside. And so the benefit of implementing a Spolsky-like program really accrues when implementing quite a few of the concepts at once. Very few people have the juice to do that. Furthermore, something could easily go wrong, entirely unrelated to one&#x27;s Spolskification program, but which torpedoes the program nevertheless.<p>Another powerful force to consider is employee morale. Employees tend to settle into a routine and resist change to that routine -- even if it&#x27;s nominally better for them. You&#x27;d be surprised at how powerful a force this is. I can almost guarantee you that if you went to any big company with an open-layout, cube-farm floor plan and proposed that everyone be given their own office, a significant percentage of those employees would grumble about it. It sounds silly to think so, but it will happen. People fear change. They tend to read into it. They think it&#x27;s a harbinger for more sinister or scary things to come. Loss-aversion is very real and very strong.<p>Of course, the upside to making big changes is the chance at big success. If you turn around your division, or if you&#x27;re the one division outperforming all the others, you&#x27;re a hero. And other divisions will follow suit. That&#x27;s a wonderful thing. But the risk that that won&#x27;t happen, and that your changes will backfire or be scuttled in some way, is every bit as real as the potential upside. When faced with that calculation, and especially when taking into account the stability of a very nicely paying and high-ranking job, a lot of managers and execs will opt not to rock the boat.<p>Again, this is not a defense of change-aversion. It is an explanation for why you don&#x27;t see more change in established firms. The vectors of big change tend to come from outside: a new CEO, a new executive hire, or the formation of a new business or division. In those circumstances, the organizational and psychological frame is oriented towards change, rather than towards the preservation of the status quo. The person leading the change has a clear mandate to do so. In other, more day-to-day circumstances, the mandate is less clear and less easily secured.",1406221413

Doctor then rejects patient.<p>Normally when something doesn&#x27;t work, you look for reasons why it doesn&#x27;t work. You then take some educated guesses at what might be blocking success, and try altering your approach. After some trial and error, you eventually discover how to make it work.<p>This doctor-patient situation is the same kind of thing, except that the doctor is simply dismissing the patient because his attempts at education on his own terms have failed. He makes no attempt at figuring out WHY the patient is rejecting the education, nor does he try altering his approach. Instead, he ram-rods what in his own opinion makes the best education down the patient&#x27;s throat, and then has the gall to blame the failure on her.<p>It&#x27;s just like in the bad old days of web apps with no UX.",1406221328

I automated everything.  All of a sudden I had copious amounts of spare time to work on interesting projects and the business started growing rapidly as we were able to scale easily to larger operations and add more revenue with fewer mistakes and more customer satisfaction.  I kept up the same pattern, and a couple years later the company is doing better than ever, I've gotten raises, etc.  I've also been able to move-on from boring maintenance to new projects as the old stuff practically runs itself.<p>Moral of the story is, if you are getting bored you're probably not automating enough or making tools to let non-tech people do most day to day stuff.

If you don't like Eclipse, both of the other major Java IDE's (NetBeans and Intellij) have Android plugins. And, since all the important tools can be run from the command line, really any text editor will do.  I wrote my first Android app entirely in Emacs.  If you're an OSX user, TextMate would probably be a great choice for Android development.<p>Also, as I believe the article points out, with Android (or MP7) you can run your development environment in a VM of our choice on top of whatever you normally use as your desktop OS (I do my Android development in an Ubuntu VM on my Windows XP laptop).  That's not practical for iPhone development.

If you want to support version X1, X2, X3, X4 etc. of iOS you have to make sure it works on all those versions, just like if you want to support version X1, X2, X3, X4 etc. of Android, you have to make sure it works on all those versions.<p>The post shows another thing: that while Google makes it easy for developers to support all OS versions by providing decent development tools (i.e. emulator that supports older OS versions) and providing developer-friendly phones (so that you can install different versions on the device).<p>In contrast Apple makes it difficult by forbidding developers to downgrade their phones for testing or providing emulators for older devices so developers have to jump through major hoops to make sure that their software runs on devices that are still being used by a nontrivial amount of users.<p>To summarize: in practice supporting multiple version of Apple's iOS is harder than supporting multiple versions of Android due to Apple's shitty developer tools and their general shitty attitude to developers, at least according to that one developer.",1293766114

TDD and unit tests alone are not enough, which motivates further developments like BDD.<p>I think we can apply an analogous argument even to a BDD process, because there are many advantageous properties code might have that can not be determined effectively using a finite number of specific, automated, behavioural tests, no matter what level of abstraction those tests run at. Your BDD process is not as limited as TDD, but it still contains a ""magic happens"" line, ""Refactor code as appropriate.""",1293764777
2054385,comment,2053956,2053956,0,0,spudlyo,,,"Varnish, the reverse proxy, has been my favorite new-to-me technology of 2010.  It sits in front of Apache and caches static content (or anything really) based on rules you define in the Varnish Configuration Language (VCL).<p>Varnish is cool because it is very fast.  It was written by Poul-Henning Kamp, who has a lot of experience in FreeBSD kernel development.  He makes effective use of virtual memory, is careful to avoid memory operations that result in expensive bus transactions on mutli CPU systems, and knows how many system calls it takes to serve up a cache hit.  All of this work has paid off.  Varnish can turn a plodding CMS into a site that screams, and your profiling tools (siege, apache ab) will fall over before the site does.<p>Of course it helps if your CMS supports cache control headers, and isn't utterly laden with cookies, but that's where the VCL language comes in.  You can write code to strip bogus cookies (like google analytics) coming from both the client and the server which vastly improves your cache hit ratios.<p>I like the way Varnish uses a shared memory pool for statistics and logging -- a wealth of information about the system is available to you but it doesn't generate a ton of I/O logging it to a file unless you ask it to.  I love how you can use the telnet admin interface to compile new VCL code into a running system and then switch to it, while keeping old named configurations around in case you need to revert back.<p>Varnish has really helped me make slow sites fast this year, although it hasn't happened without some VCL coding effort and some understanding of how the sites operate.",1293764742

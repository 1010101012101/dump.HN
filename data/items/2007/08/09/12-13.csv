I doubt Markus would want to switch architectures so an elite lisp hacker that will refuse to work on MS isn't what Markus wants.<p>The design is even worse and sometimes the site's UI doesn't even function. The girls are much uglier/less successful than match.com or OKCupid too, there's probably some explanation for that.",1186664263

And we can't get patents until we have some money because most of our patentable ideas will require more expensive lab equipment than we have right now. So for now, we try and make some money by bootstrapping and selling incense, then we get the patents, then we get the real money, then we start the interesting research like curing AIDS which offers a multi-billion dollar payoff.<p>My company is selling a a genetic test for HIV immunity. With funding, we could expand into other genetic tests very quickly and get FDA approval for as much as we can. FDA approval is not required to sell a ""home-brew"" genetic test but you can charge a lot more money if you're FDA approved because then insurance will pay for it.It won't take much to dramatically undercut all the existing genetic tests on the market, they're all really overpriced.<p>For now, I'm enjoying the process of bootstrapping and approaching biotech with the Web 2.0 ""make it yourself"" ethos.<p>Seedcamp told me they don't do biotech. Techstars sticks to Web 2.0 function companies. CRV doesn't do biotech. HCP does biotech and has a summer program targeted to college students for it. We didn't get in and they didn't tell us why, though it was still a really nice rejection and they invited us to a barbecue at their office.<p>YC <i>might</i> fund biotech if they liked you enough but they aren't a good fit for me. The biotech incubator geographically close to me is dumb and I won't give them any control of my company. They're one of those state-subsidized institutions that repeatedly lose money. This is why Pittsburgh sucks for entrepreneurs, because despite the brilliant biotech minds coming out of our universities, there is not nearly enough investment money available.<p>I should probably email Tandem and ask if they do biotech. Anyone know any seed stage funding firms/incubators that would consider biotech?",1186664000

I don't know waht random bag is - I suppose it assures that certain tiles appear after a certain time?<p>The touchy movement appears when you repeatedly hit a movement key instead of just holding the key down. I optimized for holding key down to have a fluid movement (no delay at the start of movement like i.e. in your Tetris).\nBut it seems everybody is so used to this flash bug(?) that they keep hitting the buttons :(",1186663972

That said, if I wanted to invite a friend over for tea, I can:\n1. Email\n2. Call his/her cell\n3. IM\n4. Leave a message on the FB wall.<p>I don't like to do 2 or 3 because they are real-time or require availability. For me, there's no difference in 1 or 4. ",1186662826

40849,comment,40472,40770,0,0,nostrademons,,,"All true, but the paper included graphs of women's ""productivity"" over time too, and the dropoff was nowhere near as severe after peak childbearing years.  If it were just a matter of time spent taken care of kids, you'd expect women to suffer a larger output decline, as the bulk of childrearing duties falls on them.  ",1186661935

40845,comment,40655,40831,0,0,dcbrandao,,,"It looks fairly well done. I prefer the random bag method of piece generation. Also, the movement of falling pieces is a little touchy--sideways movement can sometimes generate a double movement and sometimes no movement.\nHowever, if you play around with the game on meatbrick.com a bit longer, you'll see there is more to it than a Tetris clone.",1186660806

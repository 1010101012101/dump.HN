If I want All albums folders to be prepended by the release year I should be able to do that.<p>Edit:  Also, sometimes I have correctly named mp3's, but I haven't tagged them.  Itunes gracefully renames my files to 'unknown' removing any trace to the correct name.  And, if the files were in a folder prepended with the album year iTunes will kindly create a new folder to hold the files to leave the album art in the original folder.  (okay, that last one is Windows only)",1250413112

Can someone run through the math here for me to indicate that this is statistically significant?  According to Suicide.org, suicide is the 2nd leading cause of death for college students, and thousands kill themselves every year, so doesn't it seem like sooner or later, several of them would happen within a few months of each other on the same campus?<p>I don't mean to sound insensitive at all.

765874,comment,765825,765825,0,0,brianto2010,,,"May I attempt to interpret/summarize your prose?<p>The first two paragraphs state that a person's mind is able to feverishly focus on a matter. Paragraphs 3 and 4 say that curiosity and 'obsession' elicits originality. The next paragraph says that people can create unique order from chaos (figure stuff out). Paragraph 6 says that obsession will lead to self discovery ('alignment with the universe') and happiness ('bliss'). Paragraph 7 asks if this obsession is malignant (a 'curse').<p>The next two paragraphs seem to be the heart of the essay. It says to not 'yield' (settle) to sub-prime responses to your 'obsession' or curiosity. Also, the 'novel' response to your obsession will be a guiding light for people with similar 'obsessions' as yourself.<p>Was I close to your intended meaning?",1250412376

I did all kinds of work on my '83 Ford Ranger, and a good amount of work on my '90 Daytona, but I've gotta say that I'm a bit afraid to mess with my '07 Impreza.  With all the computer control systems and other sophisticated components, I just don't feel like I should be messing with it.  On top of my fear, I also lack the necessary (and expensive) equipment that's needed to e.g. clear the check engine light.<p>I do nostalgically miss tearing my old Ranger apart, and tuning the carburetor, and generally understanding exactly how it worked.

On the other hand, cooling a cubic metre of water and other watery solids takes a load more energy.<p>In terms of keeping it cool, that probably depends on how good your freezer's insulation is. If it's really good, it probably doesn't take too much energy to keep things cool (air or otherwise).

765865,comment,765733,765733,0,0,GTanaka,,,"1.  The biggest problem I say is its entirely closed nature.  I don't mean simply closed source -- I've used tools such as Mediamonkey for Windows and have been relatively satisfied -- but entirely closed to plugins or user developed support.  Specifically I refer to the inability to use/add anything to use FLAC, lyrics search, grabbing high quality album art ( a la allcdcovers.com ), social integration (mixtape, last.fm), 3rd party hardware syncing, and library visualization.  Each of these could be solvable if only Apple allowed some sort of plugin integration<p>2. See suggestions above<p>3. Not using mac.",1250411511

That said, keeping it as close as possible to the way it was is a good goal from a ""I get this, it's easy to work with"" perspective so I'd still really like to know if tortoisegit is as practical for real work as it appears to be from messing with it briefly in a VM.<p>Someone care to save me from a couple of days in windows again? :)<p>Wrt git svn, last time I tried that it started version controlling the .svn directorise o_O.

5100178,comment,5096523,5099595,3,0,pohl,,,"I wouldn't call opening myself to multiple languages ""jumping"", and it seems a bit of a leap that you assume so.  (Note that I said nothing of the proportions invested in each.)  The only point of my post was that one does not need to wall oneself off from one language in order to open oneself to another.<p><i>Regardless of that, going from Haskell to Scala to ML to Clojure ad naseum isn't going to get you any deeper understanding of techniques.</i><p>I suppose that's a fair view if one starts from the assumption that techniques are all that is worthy of pursuit.<p>But there is also comparison of priorities implicit in different design choices.  There is also an appreciation of history (ML is a good example of that) and an appreciation for industrial frontiers (Rust is a great example there: if you're not following Graydon Hoare you're missing out). Each language also has its own unique traits that don't readily map to others.  Haskell's lazy evaluation and monadic IO are a great example there.  Want to wield the sword of homoiconicity? Better learn a LISP.<p>Moreover, learning Haskell prepares you to read a lot of literature.  ML prepares one to read Chris Okasaki's book on purely functional data structures. (Yes, there is a Haskell appendix in the back of the book, but knowing both means you can compare them!).  Scala is worth study as a case study in the tradeoffs of making on object/functional hybrid.<p>The human brain is an associative machine, you know.  Sometimes the act of broadening has the consequence of strengthening (or even deepening), because you're giving your melon more things to interrelate.",1358895448

But if you make the raw data easily accessible then it creates the possibility for entrepreneurs to do something innovative with it, which leads to the public benefit.<p>Heck, that's pretty much where Lexis and West came from so long ago, but now technology is offering the possibility (at least in theory) to democratize the process so that someone can screw around with the data over a weekend or three and see if they can create something worth following up before they go through the trouble of looking for funding in order to buy data.<p>I don't know if we're even particularly arguing about anything.

For mathematics and physical sciences, it's about 55%.<p>www.phdcompletion.org/resources/CGSNSF2008_Sowell.pdf<p>I know this is a trick, dividing by such a low number, but I suspect that the PhD completion rate for the 3rd rated Engineering school (Berkeley) compared to the 3rd ranked law schools (Columbia) is about .3/.003.  About 100 times higher.  This is silly, because the attrition rate at Yale is zero, which means it's actually impossible to compute how much higher the top rated Engineering (MIT) PhD programs's attrition rate actually is.  Or, as we said in grade school but not grad school, ""infinity higher"".<p>There are a couple reasons for this.  Speaking as a PhD dropout myself, half of a PhD in engineering isn't as much of a loss as half of med school.  I don't need the PhD to be licensed, so nobody's going to put me in jail for writing code.  Completing 2 years of med school and dropping out is far worse than Mastering out of engineering.  I just got to earning more quickly.  At the same time, I think that many elite schools are able to suppress their true attrition rates by counting MS students as having achieved their degree goal (in short, I suspect the true attrition rate is higher than the already grim numbers).<p>But our wise elders in government (almost always lawyers) who wring their hands about the shortage of US students in PhD programs never seem to ask... why is Berkeley's Engineering PhD attrition rate 100 times higher than an elite law school.  Are the magna cum laude applied math majors with 800/800 on the GRE and specialized subject tests just dumber than lawyers?<p>In reality, Americans have pretty much given up on PhDs in engineering and science.  Sadly, this is rational for people who have the choice to go into the professions.   However, if you'd like to come to the US, and you're looking for a way to sidestep our byzantine immigration system, a grad degree in a STEM field from a good US based university can be a wise move, especially since the professional schools are far less likely to admit large numbers of international students.",1358894212

Old browsers don't work with css min-height, but they do allow the height property to expand.  Moreover, old browsers will ignore an ""important!"" tag if the same property is addressed later in that selector.<p>It's a perfect storm of dumb luck that ""min-height: 100%; height: auto important!; height: 100%;"" actually manages to do what you want, for this exact scenario, in all browsers.  That line looks pretty stupid to most modern css devs.<p>Here's an arguably cleaner approach that I believe will work for most modern browsers (I think after IE6, but could easily be mistaken).  No need for the wrapper around all content, but you still need that darn ""push"" div.  Actually now that I think about it, it might even work for older browsers if you add ""height: auto important!; height: 100%;"" to the body.  Maybe someone can test?

Anything else was selling out.<p>21.4-22.0: usual pre-PhD stuff like GREs and those ungodly applications where they make you list textbooks going back to freshman year calculus. Then there were the rejections, the acceptances, and the prospective student meetings. Those were fun.<p>22.1-23.2: in graduate program (math PhD) until internship on Wall Street turned into full-time offer. Did not return for 2nd year.<p>23.2-29.6 (now): variety of experiences in industry, some good, some not-so-good. Sometimes wish I could go back for a PhD in CS, but I realize that the opportunity cost of 5 years' income is, at this point, a house everywhere except Manhattan (where it's still a few decihouses).<p>Here are some observations:<p>If you're funded, a PhD program isn't <i>that</i> bad. It can be stressful, or it can be a lot of fun. You will probably fall behind with the opposite sex. Your lifestyle will be lower-middle-class. Your social life will be weird. You can't hang out with undergrads anymore, because the first thing you learn (late September, usually) is that college was a different planet to which you can never go back. I had an undergrad girlfriend for a little while, and the contrast between her concerns and mine was stark. Grad school is part of the Real World, and not a financially flush one. Hence, you don't really have much in common with young professionals (who are enjoying having money until the kids arrive and they're strapped again) either. Other grad students are your social pool, and inter-departmental interaction is rare.<p>It's hard. Self-study in addition to courses is no longer optional. Procrastination will ruin your life. College encourages specialization and creativity: write for a sketch comedy group, go to poetry slams, play cards till 5:00 in the morning, get sloppy drunk once a month (actually, you're not missing out if you skip that). Grad school doesn't. You might have time for <i>one</i> extracurricular activity. Don't start it until you've had a successful first year. You need to become an adult, and quickly. People who manage their time and money like a 28-year-old seem to do OK. They aren't always happy, and there's still a lot of opportunity cost in pursuing a graduate degree, but these people manage to get through it and enjoy the process. People who try to relive college do not.<p>I don't think graduate school is this horrible wringer for most people. Some are unhappy, but many of them would be unhappy anywhere. Some love it. It comes down to personal and technical maturity, as well as desires. To complete a PhD, you really have to have to want a research career.<p>What <i>is</i> horrible is the job market people face after their PhDs. That is an outright disaster.

This was I think in large part because of low key but pervasive surveillance, largely by state-at-home mothers. That few mothers worked outside the home also affected traffic levels in a couple of ways: they didn't commute, and the fathers, freed of pick-up obligations, could carpool. We had in general pretty good schools, partly because there were few professions yet open to women, partly because men who were teachers didn't get drafted, partly because professionals sent their kids to the same schools as everyone else, so there weren't long commutes to a private school--I didn't hear of an elementary school that was other than public or parochial until later.<p>It was a very homogenous middle class world--how homogenous, and how kept that way, has been documented in civil rights cases in the years since.",1358892480

Other companies include Ouya, Climate Corporation, Twitter, TapJoy, Pivotal Labs, ThoughtBot, and New Relic.<p>Here's Justin Kan on Dev Bootcamp: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4725790"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4725790</a><p>Steve Huffman, co-founder of Reddit and Hipmunk, is part of our mentorship program.<p>Social proof aside, my (formal) background is in mathematics, statistics, and linguistics.  As a programmer, I'm self taught.<p>We try really hard to teach students the fundamentals.  IMO, however, that doesn't necessarily mean teaching them the textbook list of data structures and algorithms.  Data structures + algorithms are tools people use to model various real world systems, processes, ideas, etc.  We spend tons of time teaching students how to model, what makes a good model, and so on.<p>When a student is really good at that, data structures fall in naturally because the students see the problem clearly enough that there's a ""binary-tree-sized hole"" in their solution, so to speak.  If you introduce binary trees to them at that point they'll understand binary trees on a level deeper than most.<p>It's like the scene from Good Will Hunting where Robin Williams's character explains that while Will might be familiar with all the fun facts about the Sistine Chapel, he'll never truly understand it by reading a book -- its smell, its feel, the impression it leaves the first time you enter, etc. We want students to ""smell and feel"" data structures.<p>Or, as Hegel said, ""Das Bekannte berhaupt ist darum, weil es bekannt ist, nicht erkannt.""  The familiar isn't understood precisely because it's familiar.<p>We also try not to ""teach to the test"" and get students the information they need to pass interviews -- hiring companies don't want that.<p>The core anxiety when companies hire junior engineers stems from the question: ""How much management time am I going to have to spend on this person?""  Grilling them about data structures and algorithms is one heuristic for assessing that, under the assumption that a person who knows those things inside and out is capable of learning similar things on their own and possess a certain intellectual rigor that correlates with being a good programmer.<p>We help hiring companies answer that question in a different way, which I'm happy to go into if you want.

I went deep into debt (no funding) and finally switched over to a part-time study while I worked full time. Unfortunately, it was just that point when the real research was ramping up. I remember nights where I would be falling asleep as I crammed my code in to see it work. Then more nights as I wrote and wrote and wrote. Generally my entire work took place after 5pm and continued until sometime after 10 or 11. I spent hours reading papers in my field.<p><i>It was wonderful</i>.<p>I am not saying that I loved staying up late; I am not sure that I did great in my day job. The experience of learning and studying for the sake of the learning was one of the most fulfilling in my <i>entire academic career</i>.<p>Now, I want a PhD. Because I know of no other way forward to where I am tasked with advancing our field, publishing the result, and building a <i>paying</i> career on that. I want to take the knowledge of a field into the next place. From what I can tell, generally you have to be ""someone special"" to do serious (by which I mean paid) research without a PhD, particularly publishable research (by which I mean serious work advancing the field), and I'm not particularly special; just tenacious. I'm pretty sure I'm stupid enough to launch onto the 4-7 year journey to get the drek piled higher and deeper. Maybe I'm not smart enough to get in. That's OK. I'll still take my best shot, and if I fail, so be it. I won't live with the regret of not having tried.<p>I think there's something amazing about the idea of creating an original work, and then telling everyone who cares (a very small audience) about it. Part of my task will be to open up the details of what I did and <i>tell</i> people about it; to publish this and move the world forward in knowledge, by a <i>very small amount</i>. There is so much terrible crap involved in the academic world, but it pales in comparison to industry. Some of the commentators lament being broken and bitter due to the everlasting stress without any control over their circumstance. I see this every day in industry. I might be naive, but I don't think it can be worse in the PhD.

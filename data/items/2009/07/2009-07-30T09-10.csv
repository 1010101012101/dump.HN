One time, afterwards, I suggest that we have dinner at your place instead.  You say no.  I stop inviting you over for dinner.<p>Is that anti-competitive?

This new result is quite theoretical, and I fear that I can't explain all the relevant definitions in a few sentences. QIP = IP basically means that quantum computers are not much better than classical computers -- if both are attached to an implausible theorem prover.<p>Since those theorem provers don't exist, I'm not sure if there's any practical insight to be gained from this, but nevertheless it is a surprising result.",1248947527

It's not immediately clear to me why that is, but there you go.  When the contract is up, Apple has a serious opportunity to shake that notion, but I'm not sure if they will.",1248946860

Then he realizes he must slow down as well, making space between you and him, and the safe distance propagates further backwards.",1248946520

But everything you want to get: voice, messaging, web, whatever else; you (and I) want it over the inet. They're (cell nets ops) problem is that inet access is <i>just</i> one product. They got quite confy over the years selling all kind of products and product levels enabled by their cell nets. Inet access is only one product, and in the long term, tends to have only one level: fast, no limitations.<p>That is a big problem for them I think. No room for up-sells, no room for fudging price plans. It's going to have to be fast and with no limitations or someone else will provide something that will get you closer and closer to that. And the natural advantage of having those towers is not going to last forever (think WiFi, WiMAX and what comes afterwards) so they will have to reduce their expectation and be contempt of selling plain, unlimited inet access. I'm eagerly expecting that future.",1248946422

Surely the BCA must now be regretting the day they picked a fight with Singh. As Simon Perry noted, chiropractors were largely left alone to the back pain business by the sceptics, who were far more interested in exposing other alternative therapies. Suing Singh for the ""bogus"" remark was like posting a video on YouTube of a bunch of chiropractors abusing a cat. By the time they win their battle - still a possibility - they'll have lost the war.",1248945834

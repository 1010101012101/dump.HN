7792575,comment,7790246,7792532,10,0,mbell,,,"It&#x27;s more that sound waves aren&#x27;t simple 1D sine waves varying over time. Sound is a 3D pressure field varying over time. A single microphone on the outside of the can doesn&#x27;t give you a full picture of what noise is entering the inside of the headphone. The nature of the noise, the headphone fit on the user&#x27;s head, even the shape of the user&#x27;s ears can all influence what the noise field looks like inside the headphones. ANC headphones use 1-3 microphones on the outside and 1 or more microphones inside the can. The DSP makes a guess as to what it should do based on the signal from the outside microphones, then has to make corrections based on what the internal microphones hear, all of this while filtering out your music signal (which the microphones also pick up) so it knows what is noise and what isn&#x27;t. This is why the system can&#x27;t be instantaneous, the overall system response is time varying, so the correction filters have to be adaptive. It&#x27;s also why they do a really good job at blocking continuous noise that they can zero in on an ideal correction for over time, e.g. aircraft cabin noise, but don&#x27;t do a great job with &#x27;spiky&#x27; sounds, like speech.",1400903567

There is this natural intuition to look at the top performers and try to learn from them. In reality, the rankings would look almost identical if everyone just picked everything randomly. Mutual funds and hedge funds exploit this all the time. They start lots of funds that all invest a little differently. They cull the losers and keep the ones that happened to do well.

Freedom requires the ability to up and move into an area that is a challenge for the nearest power to control, regulate, and abuse. That is the only meaningful check on the power of the sedentary bandits that become a region&#x27;s elite.<p>Historically, this has all been geography. But going forward, there is the opportunity to do something new with technology and section off slices of economic activity into reaches that while existing in the same geographic location as a centralized state are prohibitively expensive to control for its bureaucrats and enforcers.<p>The malaise of the modern world is, I think, in large part due to the shrinking of frontiers. There is little of the world left that is easily colonized but also hard for the major players to reach into, and so the states become ever more grasping. There is no safety valve by which people can up and peacefully revolt with their feet in large numbers, and that won&#x27;t return until the cost of getting into orbit falls dramatically.<p>Meanwhile, there is cryptography.",1400903186

7792561,comment,7789753,7791984,3,0,eridius,,,"> Apple colluded with the publishers to set the price, and forced Amazon to sell for the same price<p>Apple gave the publishers leverage to use with Amazon, which is a wee bit different. But I&#x27;ll give you &quot;colluded&quot;, because it doesn&#x27;t really matter.<p>I wish Google would actually find the various articles I&#x27;ve read in the past about this, but my recollection is that various economists have explained that this sort of &quot;corrective measure&quot; is actually legal and the right course of action under certain circumstances, and the ebook market (with Amazon&#x27;s near-total dominance) qualifies.<p>You say &quot;mainly the people being screwed&quot;, but that&#x27;s not true. Amazon tried to claim that prices were lower before Apple came along, but that&#x27;s actually only true for some (admittedly popular) books. Prices on other books were higher before Apple. Not only that, but the low prices that Amazon was talking about was not actually a sustainable market, but instead was Amazon engaging in predatory pricing. And predatory pricing is not something that the DOJ is supposed to be in the business of defending.<p>Basically, many people have looked at the overall book market both before and Apple entered it, and found that, when looking at the entire market instead of just e.g. the NYT bestsellers list, prices were not higher after Apple showed up.<p>It&#x27;s also worth pointing out that Apple was being accused of violating antitrust laws, which are essentially laws designed to prevent unfair monopolistic practices. It seems rather ridiculous to claim that a minority player in a market could be guilty of monopolistic practices, since that generally requires being a monopoly. It&#x27;s even more absurd when one of the main goals of antitrust is to promote fair competition, and yet it was used to punish the only real competition that Amazon had in the market. Basically, the DOJ used fair competition laws to hand a government-sanctioned monopoly to a single company.<p>---<p>I did a bit more digging, and what Apple was found guilty of was a &quot;per se&quot; violation of a horizontal price-fixing conspiracy using a series of vertical agreements. I&#x27;ve found a MacObserver article[1] that talks about a 30-page amici curiae brief filed by two economists explaining why Judge Cote&#x27;s ruling was wrong.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.macobserver.com/tmo/article/economists-on-apple-ebook-antitrust-case-judge-cote-got-it-wrong"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.macobserver.com/tmo/article/economists-on-apple-e...</a><p>There&#x27;s a 3-paragraph summary at that article, which should give you a good idea of what was wrong with the ruling.<p>I&#x27;ve seen a number of other articles since the ruling where other economists weigh in and say essentially the same thing, but Google is still being difficult.<p>---<p>Edit: One comment about this brief says that the DOJ didn&#x27;t make these considerations because it found Apple to be <i>per se</i> liable, which is to say, the DOJ considered the actions to be illegal regardless of any possible motivation. Some of the other economists I&#x27;ve referred to argued specifically against this point, saying that these kinds of vertical agreements are <i>not</i> a violation of the per se rule and that Judge Cote royally screwed up in applying it. Of course, Judge Cote&#x27;s ruling also said she would consider Apple to have been guilty under a rule of reason as well, but I find it hard to believe given how much evidence there is that Apple&#x27;s actions were indeed in its own independent business interest, and that these kinds of vertical agreements and the provisions they contained are not in fact illegal under these circumstances (my understanding is basically that they can be illegal when used by a dominant player in a market, because it&#x27;s anti-competitive, but when used by a new entrant in a market with an existing dominant player, they are ok, but IANAL).",1400902903

That&#x27;s because I created a 3D representation as large as the dimensions of the graph that was drawn, and tried arranging the blocks in every possible combination and seeing which one matched the hand drawn lines when projected to 2D.<p>If each cube in that 3D space represents a bit, then even a 4x4x4 space has 2^64 (18 quintillion) possibilities.  So you could draw a few overlapping blocks, but add one more and the iPhone would freeze for several minutes.  Add a few more and it wouldn&#x27;t finish on a human timescale!<p>I ended up getting around it with a hill climbing algorithm that tried toggling blocks and keeping the result that most closely matched the projection, with a certain amount of fanout up to N entries.  It was basically a primitive genetic algorithm.  It actually worked great even on relatively large graphs, because humans tend to draw them as a sheet where all of the blocks are next to one another on a diagonal.<p>It&#x27;s not perfect and really falls down if a line&#x27;s out of place (think M.C.

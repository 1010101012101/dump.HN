In their current state they aren't brilliantly useful for me.<p>I've always thought that bookmarks are a great idea.  It's the bookmark interface in the browser that sucks.  I think people use tabs a substitute for bookmarks for that reason.  A tab is more in your face than a buried bookmark.  It's a visual reminder.<p>Turning off the bookmark bar might be a good idea, if it's full of links that you barely touch.  Would it not be a better idea to use that space for your most visited sites, or to list your recent history, or a filtered history?<p>The one time the browser bookmark bar was invaluable for me was when the keyboard broke on my computer.  I could still surf the web quite well up to a point.<p>It's all very well saying abandon bookmarks.  But free searching requires you knowing what you want to search for.  Bookmarks can be mnemonics.<p>Sometimes we need prompting and/or signposting.<p>If I read something on the web, like a tutorial, and I think it has value.  What chance do I have of remembering every domain/url, or even the magic keywords that got me to the article in the first place?  That's when I find bookmarking useful.  Recalling that bookmark is the tricky bit.<p>As I see it, browser's are focusing on rendering and javascript performance, and neglecting the actual user interface.",1355763407
4933092,comment,4927404,4931318,2,0,clarky07,,,"You clearly have no intimate knowledge of guns and how they work, so why do you keep posting as if you do? That's a great animation, but I know how a .223 AR-15 works because I own one and have shot it many times. As it happens, I also know how a revolver works whereas you apparently haven't seen that animation.<p>The revolver would not have put 11 rounds in each kid, but it doesn't need to. 1-2 works just fine. The magazine for the AR-15 generally holds 10, 20, or 30 rounds and in this case it was almost certainly 30. If he did 11 per kid, lets round to 10, that's 3 kids per reload. 2 bullets is more than enough, so the 6 shot revolver can also do 3 per reload.<p>There is something called a speedloader for revolvers, which is just slightly slower than a magazine to reload. This guy [1] while not really going too fast, reloaded three times and shot 24 well aimed bullets in 45 seconds (starting at the 1:15 mark). I'd say that qualifies as many many round in under a minute with only a few pounds of pressure.<p>The second video [2], while obviously a world class shooter, shot 12 rounds, all on target, with a reload in the middle in less than 3 seconds.<p>This person could have very easily committed exactly the same horrific tragedy with the revolver. You just didn't know it until now. Unless having 10 bullets in a kid somehow makes it worse, this could have definitely happened with a revolver or 2 instead of an AR and a few semi-auto handguns.<p>[1] - <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC9Lahi-TqQ"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC9Lahi-TqQ</a> \n[2] - <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-tFQ1H4Awg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-tFQ1H4Awg</a>",1355763392

The United States has an interest in the Federal Reserve Banks as tax-exempt federally created instrumentalities whose profits belong to the federal government, but this interest is not proprietary. In Lewis v. United States, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit stated that: 'The Reserve Banks are not federal instrumentalities for purposes of the FTCA [the Federal Tort Claims Act], but are independent, privately owned and locally controlled corporations.' The opinion went on to say, however, that: 'The Reserve Banks have properly been held to be federal instrumentalities for some purposes.' Another relevant decision is Scott v. Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, in which the distinction is made between Federal Reserve Banks, which are federally created instrumentalities, and the Board of Governors, which is a federal agency.""",1355763340

Sometimes it's a bit of Column A and a bit of Column B.<p>I'm not suggesting that people become habitual complainers. Rather, I'm suggesting that people learn the fine art of conveying frustrations and problems -- typically, along with proposed solutions -- as they occur. You're much more likely to get an adequate resolution if you speak up while the issue is still timely and addressable. And sometimes, hey, the issue can't or won't be resolved -- at which point, you can happily mention it in your exit interview, and nobody should be surprised.<p>The point is, exit interviews shouldn't be chances to get it all off your chest. If you're walking into an exit interview with a bunch of things you haven't mentioned previously, then you've possibly missed an opportunity or two. (Exception, as previously stated: your workplace is particularly hostile to dissent, extremely political, strongly favors ""cheerleader"" types, etc.).<p>Basically, one shouldn't find himself leaving a job over something that may conceivably have been correctible.

4933032,comment,4931837,4931837,3,0,hobohacker,,,"It's unclear to me what advantages this proposal has over a HTTP/2.0 proposal using HTTP Upgrade. AFAICT, the client is unable to rely on HTTP/1.2 support in the first roundtrip. Therefore, it cannot begin utilizing the new proposed features. Relying on the HTTP/1.2 HTTP-Version within the Request-Line and Status-Line strikes me as less safe than trying to use the Upgrade header to attempt to upgrade to HTTP/2.0, as it seems much more likely for intermediaries to have broken HTTP-Version parsing than broken Upgrade support. In contrast with this proposal, when using the Upgrade header, there is much more freedom to change the wire level representation of the protocol. And if you're going to do HTTPS anyway, using TLS-NPN to negotiate a completely wire level representation (without an additional roundtrip over the TLS handshake roundtrip[s]) likewise enables more freedom to add features.<p>It seems like the main reason to prefer this proposal is if you do not want to write another parser for HTTP/2.0 and think that new features afforded by a different wire level representation are not worthwhile.<p>Another thing to note is that this proposal effectively adds on multiplexing without prioritization. Prioritization is fairly important, otherwise the client application has to do application layer throttling in order to reduce contention. Adding prioritization would help obviate the need to make the link utilization vs contention tradeoff.",1355762740

What requirement <i>specifically</i> would have prevented this error?<p>And Android does require a certification process in order for a device to be called an Android device, just not one that would be helpful here [1].<p>> Or simply disallowing any custom builds at all: OS vendor builds all drivers, provides a list of supported hardware, and that's all you get to choose from.<p>Considering how reluctant most device manufacturers are to give up their customized builds, how well do you think the ecosystem would respond to disallowing all customizations? And just because you disallow customizations, doesn't mean that all of the code suddenly comes from one company. Samsung (as the SoC manufacturer) and their component suppliers still provide (potentially vulnerable) firmware. Google has a much larger job to do in order to support even a fraction of the available chipsets, as well as a much larger job to do supporting external companies (what happens when there's a kernel bug in somebody else's phones? how long are the individual chipsets supported? etc. etc.)<p>Besides, part of the point of Android is to allow for different companies to build phones for people who want different things, while remaining compatible with the rest of the ecosystem. Barring customization is almost the antithesis of the project's goals.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://source.android.com/compatibility/overview.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://source.android.com/compatibility/overview.html</a>",1355762267

E.g., security, or multithreaded stuff. From my single real analysis course way back when, I remember an impression that real analysis was a subfield of math with a similar error-prone character --- particularly easy to conclude something incorrect by stumbling over a technicality (e.g. integrating before taking a limit instead of vice versa), where the technicality is likely to be tricky to keep track of because the cases where the technicality matters are so weird (e.g., carefully constructed horrendously discontinuous functions).<p>Not all fields of programming or mathematics are as productive of fiddly gotchas: often an experienced specialist can judge rather reliably that a piece of work will be entirely routine, though time-consuming. I can only appeal to my informal anecdotal impressions for this in programming, but in mathematics I have some harder evidence: setting up machine-checkable proofs in HOL Light. The prover won't let me get away with any hand-waving or ambiguity: I really do have to dot every single i and cross every single t. In the end, doing that is routine (though often very tedious and messy --- people talk about spending a week to formalize a page of mathematics), and I am very seldom surprised by a part of a proof that I expected to be tedious instead turning out to require new insight.",1355762095

One set of learners starts from a set of instructions. These instruction sets are simple, enumerated lists. The learner executes the steps and looks at the outcome. As they advance, they might begin to explore deviations in the steps. Reasoning like, ""What happens if I swap steps 2 and 3?""<p>The other type of learner cares less about the steps and more about the concepts behind the steps. They begin by asking, ""Why do I do step 1"" or ""How does step 1 work?""<p>Everyone I've taken under my wing who engages in the enumerated list approach hits a wall at some point. When the complexity of the enumerated list extends beyond their ability to tweak inputs, they become frustrated, and ultimately give up.<p>The latter group tends to get further, but it's not a free pass to stardom. Many still hit a conceptual complexity wall where they fail to grasp some of the more abstract concepts.<p>The former group far outnumber the latter, in my experience.

Unless you're trying to access a server actually on a satellite, the data has to go up and back down again.<p>I was being lazy and pulled my numbers from wikipedia.[1] It seems that the calculation there takes into account latitude of the transmitter and receiver, and so gives a slightly larger number. For non-equatorial ground stations, latency is higher.<p>In the context of communications, it's important to clarify what ""round trip"" means. The latency to send data from one ground station to another is, at best, 240 ms, but the time taken to request data and then receive it is going to be twice that. In practice it means that if you were browsing the web over a geostationary satellite link, it would take 1/2s between clicking a link and receiving the first data back from the server.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit#Communications"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit#Communicati...</a>",1355761613

There are at least four parts here . How does the developer, or any interface user, review the code to see if there is a complex bug inside?

And how easy is it to carry out extensions to the project in the old code base vs. the new, even if those new features aren't yet implemented?<p>Third, the type of person who strives for an elegant interface also probably strives for elegant internals.

It's standard. It's to protect your reputation. If they relieve you of your notice and still pay you, fine.

It's targeted on Indie developers without money to spend on Ads - so it's free\n2. The affiliate promotion will show up only once in a life time of a user\n3. It will not take the user out of the App to download the affiliated apps\n4. We're using an algorithm we're borrowing from recommender systems to show the users Apps they might actually like\nIf you're interested sign-in on our Launch Page - we expect to launch our first version in 4-6 weeks.<p>http://signup.300alliance.com/",1355760014

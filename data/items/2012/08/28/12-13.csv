4443400,comment,4441734,4442607,2,0,lmm,,,">To deal with the difficulty of measuring t_I, our culture and laws have instead picked a deadline t_D, such that t_D is much smaller than t_I in all cases (regardless of differing definitions or individual cases). We have declared that we should assume humans younger than t_D have proto-human legal status roughly equivalent to animal status, and humans older than t_D have full-human legal status. Killing before the deadline is legal if done in a humane way with the consent of the mother; killing after the deadline is treated the same as killing an adult would be (only allowable in very limited circumstances such as self-defense). Therefore our society can avoid some of the drains placed on it by humans who, it is known, will be born into far-from-ideal circumstances, while hopefully staying far away enough from t_I to avoid sanctioning the killing of anyone who has the moral status of a full human. (Obviously, t_D is the time of birth plus delta, where delta is less than one day (I'm not sure exactly what delta is, but I'm pretty sure it's less than one day). Delta is necessary to account for partial-birth abortions.)<p>That's a very arbitrary time at which to draw a line, and it's not even applied consistently. Everyone would consider the deliberate killing of a 22-week foetus being kept alive on an incubator to be murder, so clearly t_D must be <= 22 weeks after conception. A 26-week foetus is much closer to t_I, but there are those who consider it acceptable to kill such a thing, solely because it happens to be inside someone's body. That's the part I can't understand.",1346158755

4443384,comment,4442826,4443030,5,0,hollerith,,,">A good threading Usenet client like slrn is pretty much the peak of discussion interfaces.<p>You might be interested to hear that not everyone feels that way.<p>In fact, the lack of what I considered an acceptable client is what made me stop reading Usenet. I was running Linux at the time, and I thought all of nn, tin, rn, trn and slrn had very bad user interfaces. (I forget if Pine had a Usenet reader in it. If it did, I tried it, too. I also tried the Usenet reader in Lynx, and in fact that is what I was using when I gave up on Usenet. Lynx's user interface bothered me a lot less than the others, but Lynx had severe performance problems when I ""pointed it at"" a busy newsgroup.)<p>The user interfaces of all the clients I just mentioned are text-mode, but that is not the main reason I stopped using them: I continued to use Lynx as my web browser and text-mode Emacs as my editor for many years after giving up on Usenet.<p>trn is the client I spent the most time with.  Probably the biggest problem I had with it is that is discouraged contemplative reading.  Specifically, every other device or contrivance for reading I have used allowed me to go back and re-read what I was reading a few minutes ago. In trn, I could usually succeed in going back (using the = key or using the arrow keys combined with the ""tree view"") but some small but significant fraction of the time going back was impossible (or prohibitively difficult and tedious) because in the mean time I had reached the end of the unread articles in one group and had been automatically taken to the next group with unread articles or (if I remember correctly) I had finished up reading a huge subtree and been taken automatically to some other subtree.<p>My second big problem with trn was that it tempted you to get a ""stupid high"" by using it to overload your brain with a constant stream of information or novelty in much the same way that watching TV does.<p>Although some probably considered that a feature, I concluded that it was unhealthy.<p>The main contributor to this ""dynamic"" was the decision by the designer of trn that all a user would have to do was keep on hitting the space bar (or more realistically the space bar and the n key, which skips to the start of the next article) and he would continue to be fed new text. In contrast, browsing the web requires a person to make a steady stream of decisions about what to see next, and although these decisions seems very easy to make, this constant stream of decision points seems to prevent the use of the web to get the ""stupid"" high that certain people like myself were tempted to get whenever we used trn to read Usenet.<p>If I remember correctly, slrn shares the two problems I just described with trn.<p>I do realize that many people feel as you do about these text-mode Usenet clients that came out of the Unix tradition. I also realize that Usenet had certain ""pro-social"" and ""pro-free-speech"" properties that the web does not have. Also, note that I spent many thousands of hours reading Usenet, back when it was still a more important medium for online discussions than the web was.",1346158326

Here's my attempt to explain some of his ""issues"":<p>> No Public Wi-Fi : Several restaurants in Delhi/NCR have free WiFi, sure you probably need to buy a coffee or something, but that's hardly an expense. You won't find a public open WiFi when walking down the road, because most WiFi networks here are private networks and the their owners have opted to secure them.<p>> Cyber Cafes require passport - They need any ID proof. DL/PAN Card/Passport/Ration Card/Student ID (virtually anything goes) and they need a copy for their records. If you checked into any hotel in India or abroad, they do the same, I don't see him complaining about that. No Cyber cafes will insist for just DL / Passport, if they do, simply walk to the next one, they have a lot of competition.<p>> FIR required to get a new SIM - Not any more, I got a replacement SIM without requiring to submit a FIR for my lost phone. He skipped to mention his cell phone operator.<p>> Color Photocopies issues - If you get a color photocopy of a ID or a mark sheet, they simply stamp a small message in a corner ""COLOR PHOTOCOPY, NOT ORIGINAL"" or something to that effect. I find this practice perfectly reasonable.<p>> Courier DHL / Bluedart - Some courier companies are finicky about sending certain items not because of ""security"" concerns, but they prefer to avoid food items or glass containers. The solution is to simply walk to the next courier service. Again, the competition is quite high in this sector, and DHL and Bluedart can get away with this behavior, however that's where smaller courier services step in.<p>> Tenant verification - Yes, the tenants need to be verified, but it is not strictly implemented. Breaking news: Yes, the police officers can act like assholes sometimes, and talking about his colleague in a relatively isolated incident is a good way to prove his suspicions!<p>> Bank Accounts - The ""vouching"" system is a decades old tradition when the banking system in India was membership based. It is no longer the case even in most public sector banks, and no private sector banks implement that.<p>> Proof of residence - There are several alternate proof of residence which a citizen can furnish (and are widely accepted) : LPG Connection Bill, Electricity Bill, Voter ID, Passport etc. Take your pick. A legal resident in India will have atleast 1 of these, if not more.<p>Ultimately I find the author biased and and focusing on the border-line cases in each scenario.

To zoom out use two fingers to mark the top right and bottom left of the bounding box you want the current screen to zoom out to (again hold for half a second). This would be much more accurate. The time delay is to allow for mis-taps and to give the user time to get the bounding box the right size.<p>A variation would be similar but would be something like:<p>- hold two fingers on the screen until you get a bounding box like above.<p>- move the bounding box to the correct size.<p>- let go and the zoom happens.<p>With this method you could cancel the zoom action by collapsing the bounding box on itself vertically or horizontally.",1346156998

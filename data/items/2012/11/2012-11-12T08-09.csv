It is automatically calculated based on how much of the song you listen to (eg 100 for listening to the whole thing, 50 for half).  It gets updated on relistens.<p>The nice thing is that stuff you like bubbles to the top and stuff you don't goes to the bottom.  You can do random play by score.  Note that it doesn't only play high score stuff, but rather biases towards it, so you do get to rehear lower scoring content, just not that often.",1352710771

4772064,comment,4771545,4772031,1,0,smarx,,,"1. Both players can just give their version numbers at the beginning of the match (or checksum if that's easier). Don't start a game with someone who doesn't have the same dictionary as you, because that's not fair. Your opponent has no incentive to lie here, but they can if they want. If they try to play a word not in the agreed-upon dictionary, you'll immediately notice and see that they're cheating. (No need for a server!)<p>2. When you say ""This requires no server,"" you mean ""Game Center provides the server."" I don't know how this works, but it seems like it would allow cheating. If you want to actually know who beat whom in what game, you'll need them to submit their moves to a trusted third-party (and of course you'll need to validate that their moves were legal). I'm not disagreeing with that; it's just off-topic. (Okay, to be pedantic, I believe asymmetric keys and the right protocol would allow two players to play such that they could later disprove any false claims about the sequence of moves. But now <i>I'm</i> veering way off topic.)<p>EDIT: Just to sum up the only point I'm trying to make on this thread: Letterpress is currently a game of perfect information with only two interested parties, namely the two players. Ignoring external rules like ""You shouldn't let someone else (i.e. a computer) help you,"" there's no way to cheat undetected in a game of perfect information. E.g. When two people sit down to play chess on a physical board, there's no need for a referee. Either player can tell if the other player ""cheats.""",1352709872

4772031,comment,4771545,4771962,1,0,tolmasky,,,"1. It occurs to me that you may have misunderstood how the server system we are describing would work. Your use of the word ""oracle"" I believe implies that you think the client is asking the server if the word is fine, then if it is, the client is then sending that word to the other client -- which I agree, is no more secure. However, that is not how it would work. The way it works is you send the word to the server, if the server is happy with it, <i>it</i> sends it to the other player, that way there is a gatekeeper that it is impossible to circumvent.<p>Without a server, the solution of ""ensuring"" the same dictionary on both sides is no different than our original issue of checking individual words: how can you reliably check if both sides have the same dictionary? One side can always just lie, because it ultimately is communicating directly to the other party. The client can send fake dictionaries, fake checksums, fake app version numbers, fake <i>anything</i> to the other side. All you've done is move the individual word checks currently being done to one-time some-other-value checks. For this reason it has absolutely everything to do with a server. The server has to be the holder of the ""truth"" and thus bad words simply will be rejected with no issue.  If you are always doing checks on the client, there is simply no way to ever be sure of anything. If you want to argue ""OK fine but I don't think many people will cheat"", then that is an acceptable but very different argument. But saying ""I can thwart cheating just fine solely with client-side operations by doing ____"" is really just a waste of your time because it just won't work, you might as well just do nothing.<p>2. Here I was implying the use of the built in Game Center rankings (which I'm not sure why letterpress doesn't currently use). For example you can go on there and see the top X players of Jetpack Joyride (and this requires no server).<p>EDIT: I wanted to add that ""multiple versions of the dictionary"" is not a new problem, it is in fact just a description of the original problem. The author in fact got away with all this <i>by changing his dictionary</i>. I simply pointed out that there existed legitimate cases where this could happen (and probably likely in the future) as well as illegitimate ones, and why this is probably a good thing to consider if you are trying to solve this issue.",1352708752

You can both automate routine actions using simplest macros and carry out a deep integration of any third-party or your own user components. In fact, while extending Visual Studio, you are limited only by your own imagination, so you can realize such eccentric solutions as integration of your favorite Instant Messenger client into the project window, or even an ""achievements for developers"" http://bit.ly/xwaQxN  system like in videogames! After all, any serious developer must know and be able to adjust the development environment to his/her own needs, as well as be able to handle its possible ""glitches"".<p>At the same time, creating extensions is nowadays simple and transparent as never before, regardless of your previous experience of working with Visual Studio! You can both integrate a native library module that will be able to directly handle the low-level COM interfaces of the API environment, and a managed build that will have an access to almost all of these APIs through convenient managed wraps. While the native unit will surely provide the developer with the absolute control over the situation, using managed builds for extensions will help you get rid of a very complicated process of calculating the number of COM-objects instances and direct memory handling, allowing you to focus on implementing the functionality you need with all the power .NET Framework and Common Language Runtime can provide.<p>If youve got interested in the subject of extending Visual Studio, you can try it right now - http://www.viva64.com/en/b/0165/ . This guide will allow you to create a completely functional managed extension module for all the Visual Studio versions literally within NN minutes and start using your functional at once.",1352707253

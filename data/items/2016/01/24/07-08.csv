10961862,comment,10960872,10960872,0,0,mercer,,,"As a programmer and tinkerer (hacker?) I cannot agree more with the sentiment of the article. And what follows is not a direct response to article, which I found surprisingly positive altogether, but more of a general rumination on my own relationship with &#x27;computers&#x27; and what I often see happening among my peers as well.<p>I think it&#x27;s important not to only see things as a &#x27;computer specialist&#x27;, especially if that perspective (perhaps rightfully) can lead to pessimism these days.<p>Throughout my childhood, the main reason why computers excited me was the promise of realizing all the sci-fi stuff I read about and saw on television:  tricorders, virtual reality, video communication, voice- and touch-interfaces, zoom-in-and-enhance high-resolution maps, instant access to the knowledge of the world through some kind of AI (all voice-enabled, obviously).<p>And now, all these things actually exist (to a <i>large</i> degree), and in a device that I carry in my pocket!<p>The child that I was did not for the most part care about <i>building</i> these tools, or being about the <i>modify</i> and <i>inspect</i> them. He cared about <i>using</i> them. And he&#x27;s excited about the immense progress in what feels like a very short time.<p>This adult that I am, meanwhile, has a tendency to instead mostly complain about wifi-issues, siri not picking up on my commands, inability to install flux on my phone, app crashes, the new Google Maps interface, dropped Skype calls, the state of front-end development, and so on.<p>However justified that may be, I&#x27;ve found that focusing on what that kid wants and overcoming the issues that stand in the way has been a much better motivator than focusing on that adult.<p>To name a specific example. Based on the articles and discussions here I sometimes feel a bit... sad that I&#x27;ve mostly been working in web development since coming of age. Apparently we&#x27;re reinventing the wheel badly, javascript is a pretty bad or at best mediocre language, html/css are terrible because they were not intended for app development, npm is a shitty package manager, and so on. Sometimes I even start feeling nostalgic for the good old days by proxy.<p>But then, when I finish a little journalling/project logging tool that scratches a personal itch, and I can instantly release that to the web and let my brother play around with it, or when I write a little bookmarklet that allows me to fold/unfold/upvote HN comments using the letters on my keyboard, well, then I feel good again.<p>Because then I remember that not that long ago I wrote a game in Delphi. It required trying to figure out how to so something based on random computer magazines and a single Delphi for Dummies book, it required waiting days for help from some dude in Florida who thankfully was happy to assist me. It required putting the game on a floppy disk and hoping that as it was passed along to my dad and his colleagues, it would somehow get into the hands of others.<p>That&#x27;s when I get excited again about working with computers, and the progress we&#x27;ve made. And that&#x27;s the mindset that makes it easier for me to try and think about ways to get my younger siblings and others as excited about <i>building</i> and <i>tinkering</i> as I am.",1453621711

Superforecasting by Phillip Tetlock & Dan Gardner [1] relates an excellent description of this process in the realm of human forecasting even though they don&#x27;t phrase it as a Bayesian approach. Essentially they found that those best able to predict world events continuously honed their estimates using an iterative process updating what really could be described as the priors of the superforcasters.<p>It&#x27;s an enlightening read as they describe some of the processes used to hone intuited estimates using an outward and inward looking processes.

You have, I think, a moral responsibility to be as conservative as you possibly can be. When someone gets hurt because this system is flawed --- assuming you ever learn about it --- I think you&#x27;re going to be surprised by where it happened.

A point that Roger Dingledine (of Tor fame) made a few years ago was that people who are going to say something which their government doesn&#x27;t want them to say are going to say it anyway. If they can&#x27;t communicate using the internet, they are willing to make protests in the streets, to shout and scream to try to improve their world. The job of people making cryptosystems to try to keep such activists safe is to minimise risk and do the best they can. You shouldn&#x27;t think that you&#x27;re responsible for what happens to those people, you&#x27;re doing the best you can for them.

It&#x27;s not the hot water that shrinks a wool sweater, it&#x27;s getting it damp <i>and agitating it</i>.  The hotter it is while agitating, the faster it will shrink; being fully wet (as opposed to damp) mitigates the felting process somewhat.  It appears that cotton is the same way (although its shrinkage is less extreme and less permanent than shrinking a wool sweater!).  You can certainly get a wool sweater wet with hot water without shrinking it at all.  If you&#x27;re careful, you can wash it in hot water and agitate it to wash it properly, as long as you don&#x27;t overdo it, without shrinking it.  With some treated wools you can tumble dry on no heat, although I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it; but <i>under no circumstances</i> should you wash a wool garment (in whatever heat of water) and then put it in a dryer with any heat at all.  <i>That</i> will shrink it.<p>I knit, so I have extra awareness of how many people just don&#x27;t know what to do with wool these days, and I have to educate them if I want to give them something I made. :)",1453620001

Worst case is paying roughly the same fee it takes to license.<p>The trouble with requiring &quot;willfulness&quot; is that it requires proving the state of mind of the infringer. This is difficult, and it&#x27;s not even clear what &quot;state of mind&quot; means for a corporation. See <i>in re Segate</i>, where the CAFC tried to define &quot;willful infringment&quot; with an objective test.[1]<p>A stronger remedy than triple damages exists in patent law - an injunction against infringement. Some years ago, Polaroid won an injunction against Kodak for infringing their instant photography patents. Kodak was given 30 days to exit the instant photography business and had to buy all their cameras for that process back from consumers. They did, and that was the end of Kodak&#x27;s instant photography business. The injunction remedy still exists, but is no longer routinely available since <i>eBay vs. MercExchange.</i> in 2006.[2]<p>Without patents, there&#x27;s little incentive to innovate unless you can throw enough money at a startup to get dominant market share before someone else copies you.  VCs used to want to see a strong intellectual property position before putting in money; then they had some assurance of not losing their investment even if the technology works.  This has been less of an issue for non-technology startups; Doordash, etc. are not technology companies.<p>The case to which this brief is attached is not about software. It&#x27;s about a new way to attach transformers to printed circuit boards with surface-mount soldering. Halo, a small startup, developed a way to do this which solved a problem with the solder joints cracking during heating.  Pulse, a much bigger company whose transformers tended to crack loose after soldering, copied this and refused to pay royalties. Halo has won the infringement issue; the only remaining question is how much Pulse has to pay them.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.law360.com/articles/102863/seagate-the-issue-of-willful-patent-infringement"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.law360.com/articles/102863/seagate-the-issue-of-w...</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://www.bna.com/supreme-courts-ebay-n17179924841/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bna.com/supreme-courts-ebay-n17179924841/</a>",1453619634

Not everyone in the content ecosystem is making big hits like <i>Game of Thrones</i> or the latest Taylor Swift single and at least benefitting from some extra exposure leading to more people buying the content with real money later as well as losing out to pirates who won&#x27;t.

From the description given in the article, it appears that the rule just says if someone <i>has</i> formally complained about a copyright infringement under the safe harbor system, and that complaint has not been disputed and therefore presumably the original copy has been taken down, then the same rightsholder does not have to <i>keep</i> formally complaining about the exact same material if it&#x27;s uploaded again after being taken down the first time.<p>I don&#x27;t see how this stops anyone from publishing anything, unless it&#x27;s already been published, and that has been challenged, and the person who published it has not exercised their right to dispute the allegation of infringement. And the extra burden here is primarily on the hosting service, which is usually the huge beneficiary of safe harbor agreements already and still bearing far less burden than they otherwise would under the law.<p>How is any of this unreasonable, assuming a fundamental desire to reconcile freedom of expression with the legitimate interests of copyright holders that are recognised and protected by law in as fair a way as possible?",1453618898

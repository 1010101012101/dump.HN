As a fan of Microsoft that uses their development tools and happily owns a Windows Phone, the best thing Microsoft could do is create a fork of Chromium and call it Internet Explorer 12.  They seriously just need to start over completely.  I&#x27;ve read all the advantages of IE11 but Chrome and Firefox just blow it away in speed and lack of hassle.  They&#x27;d probably go back to 90% browser share if they built in a fork of Chromium to the OS that they didn&#x27;t modify in any significant way (ex:  don&#x27;t try to make it support ActiveX, just let that technology die).",1403089068

The best-paid job you can get pays just barely enough to keep your family in decent conditions. So you take that job, for the money. It costs 1/3 of your life, but the benefit is that your spouse and children get not to starve or live in squalor. Wasted?<p>2. You give a substantial fraction of your income to charities that save the lives of desperately poor people in Africa. You take a well-paid job, for the money. It costs 1/3 of your life, but the benefit is that every year you&#x27;re working one more poor African gets to live instead of dying.<p>3. You have a choice between a job you like pretty well, and a job that&#x27;s merely OK but pays a lot more. You take the well-paid job, for the money. It costs 1/3 of your life (or, more precisely, 1/3 of your life is somewhat less satisfying than it could have been), but the benefit is that you retire at 50 instead of 60 and have an extra decade of (according to taste) leisure, or working for the public good rather than for money, or starting your own business with the security of knowing you won&#x27;t starve if it fails, or whatever.<p>All of these involve working &quot;for the money&quot;.

Youtube is great for discovery and poor for streaming, which makes for great conversion.<p>However, what Google are trying to do is essentially turn Youtube into a fully fledged music streaming service, but they&#x27;re framing it as the same old video sharing service to justify continued abyssmal payouts. They can do this because they know that artists will put pressure on their labels to get back on Youtube if they&#x27;re ever blocked.

We lost him in an accident on the night of 15th June&#x27;14.<p>Now everybody knows that he was the best coder India has ever produced. He was one of the first red coder from the country and continued to dominate until his last SRM. He was the TCO world finalist twice, and Google Code Jam(GCJ) once. He worked on to make DP his strongest area (for the non-programming people, DP is Dynamic Programming and is one of the toughest things to master in programming). I have had the privilege to spend some time with him and know him more closely and that is what I am going to share in this answer.<p>For the last one year, Lord was working in a start-up (that he co-founded with Animesh Nayan) MyCodeSchool. I was selected in a 10 day Winter Coding Camp 2013, organized by the company, where he gave awesome lectures. But the 15 days internship MyCodeSchool, Hyderabad, (May-June &#x27;14) is how I came to know him more as a person.<p>Lord had this amazing passion to spread and share knowledge. This was one of his last conversations with Animesh :\nAnimesh: &quot;If we can make some money, we can help more people,&quot;\nHarsha: &quot;May be, we can enable 1000 people to help others.&quot;<p>I also came to know that he gave up Microsoft in his college just to train the college team for ACM ICPC. He never went behind big companies, his wife works at Google and he could have easily been a Googler himself. He worked for his passion. &quot;You do not need too much to live. It&#x27;s all the social conditioning that makes you desire a big job and a fat salary. You can live with less and  be free.&quot; This is what he used to say.<p>Contrary to the second part of his TC handle(humblefool), the first part is completely correct. Lord is the most humble person I have ever met. With the knowledge and experience that he had, he could have easily commanded us all. But instead, he was always open to us, and on many instances came for our opinions and suggestions. You would never know that you were sitting next to a person of his stature. \nNow you will never associate such a geek in other domains. But Lord was awesome in every field. Maybe that is why he is called Lord. Many know that I defeated him once in chess(that too on time) because I posted it on facebook. No one except me knows the second part of the story. He came back strong and forced me to resign from that game. Played tennis and he beat us all most of the time. Always a winner in stratego. Banged on karaoke, he hit the best score 98 twice (even without any practice). He single handedly won Counter Strike against two of us (FYI, we are not noob at CS). He was a complete all-rounder.<p>His thoughts were always full of clarity and vision. I had a half an hour bike ride with him,(we had all gone to Prasad&#x27;s for a movie, and not everyone could fit in the car, so I was the fortunate one to come with him), I discussed my career and future plans with him, and he made it crystal clear for me.<p>Memories flashback, as I write, and take me to his birthday, we had planned a surprise for him. Never had I imagined that it would be his last. A photo on his birthday treat. (Harsha is the righmost).<p>Harsha is a true legend. He has been an inspiration and idol of many indian programmers. And as Animesh puts in, &quot;He has chosen to go to heaven because God needed a genius programmer there&quot;.<p>May his soul rest in peace. RIP Harsha, RIP the Lord.&quot;<p>------------------------",1403086817

I&#x27;ve been learning about efficiency and cost, and was told recently that many large-scale installations in unsecured location use 9% efficient thin-film technology simply due to cost.  Having your 20%-40% high-value panels stolen doesn&#x27;t net you benefit.<p>And you&#x27;re still working against other constraints:  a maximum insolation at Earth&#x27;s surface of around 1 kW/m^2, the local insolation rate (great tool from NREL for mapping that within the US: <a href=""http://maps.nrel.gov/prospector"" rel=""nofollow"">http://maps.nrel.gov/prospector</a>), panel spacing (you net about 55% area fill rate at 36 degrees latitude based on panel angle and avoiding overlap), inverter efficiency (about 90%), capacity factor (amount of time you&#x27;re receiving full sunlight), and more.  By the time you account for all of this, you&#x27;re down to about 30W of that 1 kW you can actually deliver (time-averaged -- peak is closer to 97W).  And if you want to allow for storage, you&#x27;ve got even more losses.

It does make some sense on an aircraft carrier with a limited number of planes, but even then there was talk of having two of the four squadrons specialize in air-to-air and two in air-to-ground.  The problem: who doesn&#x27;t want to fly combat missions into Iraq and Afghanistan?<p>At the end of the day, I generally recognized that the F-15C pilot was going to be better at air-to-air, the A-10 or F-15E pilots better at air-to-ground.  The F-16 pilots more jack-of-all-trade types (excluding CJs) with a slightly better aircraft that can&#x27;t land on the boat.  And the F-14 pilots better at drinking in the bar.<p>I also think the general consensus when I left a couple years back was that the F35 is a turd.  Probably a better turd then anything else out there (excluding maybe the F-22), but not worth the price, and riddled with flaws. General&#x27;s and Admiral&#x27;s, however, put pressure on anyone who even thought of speaking negatively about the program.<p>If the saying goes: &quot;Arm-chair generals study tactics, real generals study logistics,&quot; then our current crop of General&#x27;s and Admiral&#x27;s forgot the part about only &quot;morons putting all their eggs in one basket.&quot;  This is exactly what the JSF is: a basketful of eggs ready to break.<p>Unfortunately, the defense industry has gotten so totally out of control that we can&#x27;t afford anything it provides.

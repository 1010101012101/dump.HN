Assuming you could actually make minimum wage in most of the country you would be far better off. Which actually supports the idea that wage theft is rampant in the industry.<p>Further, like many cash businesses it&#x27;s likely to attract many illegals which are generally highered at risk. For an industry already stuck at minimum wage across most of the country  the only way that risk is worth it is if there making less than that.<p>PS: the other reason to use illegals is if the supply of workers is limited, but that would tend to push wages well above minimum wage.  if the rules where actually inforced many nail bars would likely close, until reduced supply drove up either prices or utilization to support higher worker pay.",1437868611

In terms established in case law that means a descriptive mark must have acquired &quot;secondary meaning&quot; by use that establishes it as uniquely identifying the services of the registrant in order for the mark to be distinctive and so qualify for registration.<p>In the real world the USPTO should adhere to the USC as much as in my imagination and failure to do so is contrary to the rule of law. In my book that makes USPTO &quot;wrong, wrong, wrong&quot; but you&#x27;re entitled to disagree.<p>You could also plainly look to 15 USC 1051(b)(3)(D) and see that Disney perjured themselves in applying for the mark as &quot;to the best of the verifier’s knowledge and belief, no other person has the right to use such mark in commerce either in the identical form thereof or in such near resemblance thereto as to be likely, when used on or in connection with the goods of such other person, to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive&quot; can not be claimed of the name of a story character that is in common use in other people&#x27;s products and to refer to other people&#x27;s products, eg [Grimm&#x27;s] Snow White.<p>tl;dr I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m wrong.",1437868446

Not understanding the deep details I would like to see more nuanced debate. What are the actual and potential risk, and what are the actual and potential benefits.<p>On the risk side, GMO proponents like to argue that the technology is safe because we haven&#x27;t found any ill effects. But what they are really saying is that we haven&#x27;t found any so far. I remember studying genetics and being told about junk DNA, even Francis Crick, co-discoverer of DNA’s double-helical structure, suspected it was “little better than junk.” Since then this opinion has changed. We find out new things about DNA all the time, it is now thought that previous generations experiences can change decedents. Reading the recent articles about Chinese scientists using CRISPR to modifying embryos they started with 86, 71 survived, and 28 were successfully spliced, not really a precise operation. With this in mind I find anyone who says there is no risk is not being intellectually honest. The question that comes up is what are the chances that we are Marie Curie working with something that ultimately harms us?<p>In terms of assessing benefits I like to take the example of X-ray technology. From the 1920s to the 1970s a machine known as a shoe-fitting fluoroscope was used to see if shoes fit feet (especially children&#x27;s feet). With the growing understanding of the harmful effects of radiation these machines were phased out, although never banned. That doesn&#x27;t mean we don&#x27;t x-ray people, we do, if you break a bone or go to the dentist the benefit of diagnosing the injury or cavity is considered to outweigh the damage from the radiation. For people in Western nations with plentiful food supplies the macro scale benefits of GMO seem limited, we weren&#x27;t starving to death or going blind before GMOs. However if my family and friends were going blind due to Vitamin A deficiency the benefits would weigh more heavily on my opinion.<p>I don&#x27;t claim to be an expert in this area but am interested in being provided with a more neutral analysis to help me form an opinion.",1437866720

9949403,comment,9947237,9949231,0,0,sago,,,"> was struggling to both swim and hold their child above water<p>Rescuing active drowning victims (this kind of drowning) is very dangerous, for that reason. The victim won&#x27;t just hold you, they&#x27;ll <i>climb</i> you. And keep climbing until their head and shoulders are out of the water. Because your combined bodies have finite buoyancy this means you go down. The victim doesn&#x27;t have to be big to push you under. It is nothing to do with strength at all, and nothing to do with how strong a swimmer you are. I defy any strong swimmer to tread water for more than a couple of seconds with a 6 year old on their shoulders.<p>So a lifeguard without a flotation device has to approach victims very differently. Normally from behind, where they can&#x27;t be climbed. Their aim is to get the victims head <i>only just</i> above the water. The victim is panicked, and won&#x27;t like that one bit. Some of the rescues in the video aren&#x27;t that great for that reason: the lifeguard doesn&#x27;t keep the buoy between them and the victim, putting them one slip of the buoy away from a possible double drowning.<p>I&#x27;ve heard LGTIs tell students that in extreme cases they should wait for the victim to go passive (lose consciousness) before a rescue, if they can&#x27;t approach safely. I&#x27;d never teach that, because it is unnecessarily callous and easy to misinterpret. But as a rescuer you do have to be prepared to swim down to get the victim to release you. Being safe around a drowning person is hard, and most lifeguard trainees <i>massively</i> overrate their swimming power in that situation. That&#x27;s why there are so many multiple drownings.<p>> I was surprised that this person could switch from swimming to drowning so quickly.<p>That&#x27;s a really good point. It is surprising how folks you mark as being &#x27;okay swimmers&#x27; can change immediately something goes wrong. I think it is the power of that instinct. I don&#x27;t know how many people gradually get into difficulty, then begin drowning. It&#x27;s rare, I think. More common something in their brain switches from &#x27;in control&#x27; to &#x27;panic&#x27; and the body takes over.",1437865829

Unfortunately, Shared Workers aren&#x27;t supported everywhere yet[1] (only on Chrome, Firefox, and Opera), but hopefully support will come to the other browsers soon.<p>Regarding playing sounds on iOS, the Web Audio API is a good way to go here.

So you can add a button to your web app which when clicked plays a short &quot;empty&quot; sound (just silence), and after that point you can play whatever sound you like at whatever time you like; it no longer needs a user gesture for it to be played.<p>[0]: <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SharedWorker"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SharedWorke...</a><p>[1]: <a href=""http://caniuse.com/#feat=sharedworkers"" rel=""nofollow"">http://caniuse.com/#feat=sharedworkers</a>",1437865656

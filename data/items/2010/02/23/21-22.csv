Sunlight is hardly monochromatic, and is in fact spread out over a very broad spectrum.  More specifically, these cells can ostensibly absorb 96% of light with wavelength <= 1130 nanometers, which corresponds to the band gap energy of silicon.<p>Also, the article does not address the important fact that absorbing light is not tantamount to converting it to electrical energy.  Namely, any energy that a photon carries in excess of a semiconductor material's band gap (silicon's is 1.1 eV) is wasted as thermal energy.  For silicon, which lies near the tail end of the sun's spectral curve, this means that about 61% of absorbed sunlight goes to thermal losses.",1266961870

Frequently the effect doesn't affect all people the same (e.g., in clinical trials, even when a treatment is statistically significant, some people under the treatment effect will get worse rather than better).  And yet, even though these effects are tiny and not universal, the journalist almost always reports it as though it is some ironclad rule of human behavior.<p>I have no idea how strong the birth control pill effect is; maybe it is indeed a strong one.

To show the market problem is NP-hard, you would need all 3-SAT reductions to lead to a valid market problem.

And since most men, as most women, also refrain from trying to start their own company or follow their passion (even though both are very common desires) due to their fears and the social context they've grown up in, I think that if one were to alter the growth of startups from women (as men) one must focus first on deconstructing the prejudices and, in particular, just helping people to start.<p>I think that YC has done a very good job of that.",1266959315

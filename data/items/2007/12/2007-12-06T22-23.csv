Its to give computers to third world countries where people have little to no access to them.  Microsoft trying to sell XP with these laptops - which doesn't seem to make much sense, since they're supposed to be cheap - wouldn't help the project in any way.  So basically, it seems like any market share/income they might make wouldn't be much and would come at the expense of the very people the project is trying to help, and so yes, it would 'seriously blow'.",1196981922

A dozen years ago when I was applying to colleges, I really wanted to go to MIT but tuition was more than my mom earned a year so I didn't even apply.  That's great if other good students can avoid missing out like I did.",1196979594

86820,comment,86819,86819,0,0,amichail,,,"""What prompts me to write on this theme is a new and wholly unexpected family of algorithms that provide efficient methods for several problems that previously had only brute-force solutions. The algorithms were invented by Leslie G. Valiant of Harvard University, with extensive further contributions by Jin-Yi Cai of the University of Wisconsin. Valiant named the methods ""holographic algorithms,"" but he also refers to them as ""accidental algorithms,"" emphasizing their capricious, rabbit-from-the-hat quality; they seem to pluck answers from a tangle of unlikely coincidences and cancellations. I am reminded of the famous Sidney Harris cartoon in which a long series of equations on a blackboard hinges on the notation ""Then a miracle occurs.""",1196979077

The good news is that most MIT trustees have sense enough to know that these things will only devalue their own degrees.  :P",1196978450

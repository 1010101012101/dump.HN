It always surprises me how few people know that (is there a conspiracy in the USA, where parents teach their children about the inch at exactly the time their thumb is an inch long? When do they learn about the foot, then?)<p>That should be obvious from <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Roman_weights_and_measures#Length"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Roman_weights_and_measu...</a>, which states <i>""The Roman foot was sub-divided either like the Greek pous into 16 digiti or fingers; or into 12 unciae or inches""</i>. So, Romans thought a thumb to be longer than a finger by 4:3.<p>I think it also makes sense when looking at the way one would measure stuff. How would you go about measuring something in thumb lengths with some accuracy? With widths, you can grab it between thumb and need finger of one hand, place thumb and index finger of the other hand next to it, move first pair to the other side, etc.",1368348929

The last case might be interesting in order to inform consumers so that they will not purchase the product in the future.<p>Lets imagine the situation where you walk into shoe store X, and it is known that the store is associated with child labor.

An alloc can be almost immediate or take lots of time because it has to request a fresh memory block from the OS. Similarly, a free can or cannot take time to coalesce blocks.<p>Yes, the differences are much smaller there, certainly historically, but garbage collectors have improved, and I am not sure that C-style allocators can stay predictable in long-running programs. Let's say you have a terabyte of RAM, and want to run a multi-threaded server in it 'forever'. Chances are that your garbage-collected system will be more stable and use less memory because it can compact memory. A C style allocator would need quite a few heuristics (or maybe, even contain some machine learning code that builds a model of memory allocation patterns) to prevent memory fragmentation. Such features would make their timing less predictable.<p>Because of that, I think we may at some time see an OS with built-in garbage-collection become mainstream.",1368346419

Eventually we switched to Windows NT4 once it became clear that OS/2 had had its fifteen minutes.<p>I quite liked it at the time, but to be honest I think the wistful ""could have changed the PC world completely"" stuff I sometimes hear is just rose tinted nostalgia. It was a very good OS for its time; its main competition then was Windows 95, and there was certainly no contest there. But the NT kernel was a different matter, especially after it got a saner UI in NT4. There were no huge advantages to one or the other there (with one exception, see below). Compared to very different modern OSes such as OSX or Linux, OS/2 and NT4 were close siblings.<p>OS/2's one real Achilles heel, which gave us endless trouble, was the synchronous input queue, shared by all programs that had a GUI (including the OS desktop). The upshot of this was that, if a user-facing program crashed, it was very likely to freeze up the OS and require a hard reboot. When we switched to NT4, the vast improvement in reliable uptime was a breath of fresh air (if nothing to write home about by modern standards). I gather they partially fixed this in OS/2 4.0, but by then the writing was on the wall. OS/2 faded away before the rise of modern malware had really hit its stride, but I suspect the SIQ problem would also have led to all sorts of security issues. For example, look up ""shatter attack""; that was bad enough on Windows, but I'm pretty sure OS/2 would have been even more vulnerable to that sort of technique.<p>While I certainly wouldn't claim that son-of-NT's victory over OS/2 had anything to do with its technical merits, I do think that, at least between those two lines of development, the (slightly) better OS won.",1368346224

Linux does have modules and you can put substantial amounts of functionality in them. If you need or want to is another question. Client-Server? The discussion of micro- vs monolithic kernel is not completely settled, but so far Linux does pretty well despite theoretical and academic arguments against its architecture.<p>Elegance is nice, but at the end of the day it is the features and the performance which matter to the user. NT claims better flexibility, however it is Linux, which can be used from Cloud to Cluster to Desktop to Mobile to Small-embedded devices.",1368346186

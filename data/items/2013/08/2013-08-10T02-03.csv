6189904,comment,6187014,6189640,2,0,gizmo686,,,"I was a student from a small private school that literally wrote their own math book, so I have no idea how generally applicable this is. 
As you suggest, a common technique my teachers employed is setting us loose on problems we did not yet have the tools to easily solve (but which were within reach). We would typically work in small groups, and if necessary the teacher could speed up progress by dropping us hints.
We inevitably (in the beginning) would come up with week/non-rigourous solutions, which would often lead to debate as a class, pushing us to formalisation. 
As far as learning new techniques/generalizations/ETC, we would almost always &#x27;learn&#x27; them after we have already been using them.<p>One thing I noticed during in math classes is that I don&#x27;t really need to know anything. For me, and most of my classmates, most of formulas could be easily derived from simple and intuitive principles. For example, almost no one in my class actually &#x27;knew&#x27; the quadratic equation, or the common trig values (ie. sin(30)). What we did know was how to quickly find those if we needed them.<p>As to your question of a standard pace, groups tend synchronize themselves. If every comes in at a similar place, and you have alot of group work and full class collaboration, then the slower students will gennerally still be able to follow the groups discovery trail, even if they do not contribute as much. The important thing here is you make sure that students are comfortable to ask questions, and that you do not have a few students dominate the discussion such that they loose the rest of the class.<p>Again, that comes from the perspective of a student at a school where the teachers had a lot of leeway in how and what to teach.",1376103381

I will answer as honestly and faithfully as I can. I am not an American. I am an attorney in a far away land. Look up my user name if you really must.<p>ALL the information I have posted is publically available. ALL of it. <i></i>The NSA should be more careful.<i></i><p>What has the information been used for? The one XKeyscore slide stated over 300 terrorist captured. The NSA claim that their internal spying has disrupted 58 plots in the USA. Where are all these supposed terrorists and when are their trials starting? We&#x27;re not talking about the Boston Bombing, because they weren&#x27;t there for that. We&#x27;re talking about 58 seperate terrorist attacks which Americans have never heard about? Oh wait I hear you say &quot;they were kept secret for a reason...&quot; No... How about this is all fiction. Where is the evidence? General Alexander should be able to sit back, smile and start listing the targets, preparations and everything regarding each of these &quot;58 supposed plots&quot;, yet he can only point to a single guy sending $8500 to Al-Shabaab. WOW! $8500!!! Stop the frikken presses! $8500!! /s<p>The other uses of internationally intercepted communications is to mark people out for death based on who they have been talking to. You are aware that the US uses telephone metadata from Afghanistan to launch strikes. Meaning that the content of the phonecalls matters not, what matters is how many times you speak to someone considered to be few enough hops away from someone considered a terrorist? I think the continual drone strikes are a crime against humanity and you only have to consider what it is like [to live with the constant threat of death hanging over them.](<a href=""http://www.livingunderdrones.org/living-under-drones/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.livingunderdrones.org/living-under-drones/</a>)<p>I&#x27;m not really enjoying my schadenfreude and I told you so when it comes to US citizens losing their rights. FFS! I TOLD YOU SO! You know how many thousands of downvotes I have had to endure trying to warn of the dangers? I eventually just gave up. Americans just knew better. It fucking pains me that I got nowhere fast.<p>I believe that privacy is a basic human right. It is not permissable to trample it underfoot because &quot;terrorists&quot; and &quot;terrorism&quot;. I have lived through a real armed campaign with bombings and landmines and I didn&#x27;t buy it then and still not buying it now.<p>Which USG clandestine operations do you believe are of value? It all seems to have backfired rather spectacularly.<p>What about the abuses of these very same progams that we&#x27;re hearing about? Do you think the internal surveillance should be automated and watch for people spending money they shouldn&#x27;t have, can&#x27;t explain and/or haven&#x27;t declared to the IRS? So you think the internal surveillance should be used for petty drug possession busts?<p>How many people are there in Al-Qaeda? A 100 as the ISI reckon? A 1000? How many of those are in the USA? OK. Now WHY are there 117,675 active surveillance targets in PRISM&#x27;s counterterrorism database? It&#x27;s out by a factor of 117:1. There are over a million Americans on the Terror Watch List. What is THIS ALL ABOUT? Do you have any idea?<p>What is the FISA court record for and against the government? All those warrants to do all that spying.... how many cases have eventuated because of this.<p>So yes, I am against the NSA and everything they do and enable. I don&#x27;t think the NSA represents the USA in any meaningful way. From the outside it looks like a rogue operation with no meaningful oversight.",1376103265

Plain coloured walls are featureless, so there&#x27;s nothing for most algorithms to latch onto.<p>However, tracking a white object such as a piece of paper sitting on a contrasting desk is relatively easy. Especially if your algorithm is designed to handle such a case. You have the easily detectable corners and edges of the paper, and from that you can infer its transformation. You can also detect its soft deformation (such as bending or crumpling the paper) if your system is assuming a piece of paper as the model.<p>The way some tracking works is to use a corner detector to find &quot;interesting&quot; features. A naive tracking algorithm will then examine the spatial neighbourhood of each feature in the next frame in order to find out where it has moved to.<p>There are better feature representations (such as SIFT) which define a &quot;feature&quot; in an image in such a way as to be scale and rotation invariant (you can match the feature against scaled and transformed versions of itself). There are also much better ways to track across frames of video data.<p>Given that Meta has infrared and RGB stereo cameras it has a lot more information to work with.

I was able to upload the PNG file that I wasn&#x27;t able to before, but I still can&#x27;t upload any gif files. All of the gif files that I tried to upload stuck at exactly this point: <a href=""http://alog.lu/mcrush.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://alog.lu/mcrush.png</a>. I tried to upload a gif file that has a smaller size (~2MB), and it looked like I was going to upload it successfully, but the upload started all over again and then get stuck at the exact same point. It&#x27;s really strange. I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s not due to my connection because I can use any other website perfectly fine and I did try to upload different gifs from different browsers, but I got the same result. Maybe it&#x27;s an OS related issue? I&#x27;ll try again tomorrow morning on Xubuntu to see if the problem persists. Thanks for your interest and your answers on other issues.",1376100739

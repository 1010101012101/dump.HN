There are a <i>lot</i> of questions.<p>- What monitor do I even buy?<p>- What&#x27;s a good monitor brand?<p>- Do I have to buy an Apple-branded monitor? If not, do I have to look for &quot;Mac compatible&quot; or something on the box?<p>- I have to buy cables?<p>- What cables do I need? (The customer will probably need an adapter, at least, as most monitors do not include a Mini-DP connector/adapter)<p>- Can I just use my TV?<p>And so on and so forth. It&#x27;s a lot more than just the physical act of plugging a monitor in.<p>Again, it&#x27;s so easy for us, but you if you work in the tech industry you really need to think outside of your own head sometimes. Imagine if car manufacturers expected us to manually adjust the fuel/air mix in the engine because it&#x27;s just a &quot;five minute job.&quot;",1403114354

It was like a panic attack, but with unhappiness.<p>I really wanted to die and make it be over. But I&#x27;m too much of a coward to commit suicide.<p>I had a really good friend who <i>always</i> answered my phone calls and for that I am immensely grateful.<p>It took another 2 years to learn to be okay with being alone. I got myself on a pretty intense personal project (raising & training a goshawk), stayed focused on that, and ended up with a huge success there. I put myself to lot of smaller projects (home improvement type stuff) and learned I could do these things alone and have fun. I actually started appreciating alone time because I had permission to do anything I wanted to do.

7911563,comment,7909908,7909908,2,0,mimicoctopus2,,,"In short -- quit the f<i></i>king job right away, Sir !<p>Why? You seem to like logic but continuing in this job is making you incoherent. Look at the following two statements:<p>1: &quot;I find myself alone in a flat full of boxes no longer having a purpose&quot;<p>2: &quot;The loneliness of being unemployed worries me&quot;<p>That doesn&#x27;t sound very logical. Loneliness is always measured in absolute terms. You&#x27;re either lonely or you&#x27;re not. Since you are (having used the word 4 times in that post), why worry about an empty transition? Specially when it can change things for better.<p>Now let me give you a couple of reasons to live for, even if you think your life currently doesn&#x27;t have any meaning.<p>1) Shit happens !\nThat&#x27;s the most ugly and the most beautiful thing about human life. It doesn&#x27;t let you be absolutely sure about anything. All you can do is just play your best game or sometimes even just watch yourself being thrown around. Now I agree that life can be a total bitch sometimes and not give us a break at all but that&#x27;s what you signed up for. buddy! The choices you&#x27;ve made have gotten you at this point but you&#x27;re still the one holding the reins. Just turn the damn horse around.<p>2: Death is boring\n..while life is full of possibilities. Somebody here suggested trying the Milky Way at night in the middle of a desert. I&#x27;ll bet that&#x27;s something you don&#x27;t wanna die without seeing it in real at least once. And there&#x27;re a thousand other things you&#x27;ll not be able to stop yourself from fantasizing about. Human connections do feel like everything but they just can&#x27;t be everything there is. There&#x27;s obviously so much more going on. Be patient, give it more time and it&#x27;ll turn it&#x27;s good side to you too.<p>3: Being --\nImagine the day your mother gave birth to you. Your parents must have been the proudest people in London that day. Imagine your parents holding you in their hands, a long montage of all the happy memories must have ran through their heads in a second--the things they&#x27;re about to experience while raising you, watching you grow, succeed, fail and then learn stuff from it and much later become a man of the family some day. That&#x27;s all still true, dude. Don&#x27;t take this away from them and don&#x27;t take this away from yourself when you still have a chance of making this a happy ending. May be even happier than a Bollywood movie ending. :)",1403114330

Or maybe a success at something trivial inspires someone to a more ambitious next effort. If we want to have a culture of people sharing things they&#x27;ve made—which we do—we need to accept that most won&#x27;t seem very impressive.<p>A good example is 2048. That game and its many variations weren&#x27;t necessarily technically impressive. But the way in which a whole bunch of people riffed on each other&#x27;s work for a few weeks—that was one of the most creative things ever to happen spontaneously on HN. If the game itself had been less trivial, I doubt that would have happened. The barrier to entry would have felt too high, so people without much time or experience wouldn&#x27;t have gone for it.

Just considering capital gains from a sale of the business to keep it easier, you will owe taxes to both the US and Puerto Rico. These are called &quot;built in&quot; capital gains. You can look up details on this, but taxes are owed to the US and to Puerto Rico at rates that change over time depending on how many years you are resident in Puerto Rico before selling the business. This is the most complicated scenario.<p>If you start a qualifying Puerto Rican business after becoming resident in Puerto Rico and after having been accepted into Act 22, then you would start with a zero cost basis. This is the best case scenario. When you sell this business, you could owe 0% capital gains. However, during the lifetime of this business, you will still pay FICA taxes (15.3%) on earned income to the US Federal government up to the regular cut off levels, personal Puerto Rican earned income taxes on a portion of your income, and 4% corporate tax on business income.

I&#x27;ve contemplated suicide before, while I never got into divying up percentages here are somethings I realized:<p>- It&#x27;s ultimately illogical and selfish. I got into computers because I loved solving problems and I had a problem.  The problem was that I couldn&#x27;t solve my problem...at least not on my own, and not yet on my own.<p>- I&#x27;ve had no less than three panic episodes and emotional breakdowns where I would weep uncontrollably for hours.  This is typically the culmination of an intense sadness, loneliness, and apathy.<p>I&#x27;m 34 years old and am still battling manic-depressiveness.  Still waking up feeling like I got punched in the face, there are days I write shoddy code, and there are days where I do get feelings of suicide.  But the reason why I never acted upon it is because there&#x27;s always the light at the end of the tunnel...the issue isn&#x27;t if there is a light, the question is when will the light come about.  And yes, it does show...for me, it took a while but it came and it came beautifully.<p>For starters, I targeted behavior that I knew was self-destructive.  I began practicing religion again (or whatever you&#x27;re into), I began practicing martial arts - going to the gym was, like you said, a distraction.  Martial arts is a community workout, everyone participates and you can&#x27;t help but build friends.  Since I&#x27;m a practicing Christian, I found a church and began meeting people there.  In short, I looked at self-destructive tendencies and reversed it.  Because of my introversion, I simply created borders and notified people that, sometimes, I like to be alone.  However, I made sure to be around non-technology people (which gets me out of thinking about work) and I like to find people who are eccentric and outgoing (extroverts, especially).<p>Even small changes that I&#x27;ve implemented in my life have made huge impacts.  I forced myself to be less shy, I would gladly pay for a friend&#x27;s dinner if it meant not eating alone, and I got better at planning outings because I know that it&#x27;s easy to slip into apathy and depression.  So I surround myself with people, build trust, and create lasting friendships.<p>You honestly can&#x27;t quit your job just now.  First you need to build a support system before you do that.  Believe me, there&#x27;s hope, there&#x27;s always hope.",1403112011

And that&#x27;s far from being proven.<p>Google does not have an obligation to the common good other than an ethical and a moral one, a real obligation is a legal one and I - in spite of being fairly harshly critical of google on lots of fronts - have no doubt that if they could solve the spam problem in an effective way would not need any prodding at all to go and do that immediately.<p>Demanding they do better is tantamount to dictating that an advance in technology be made, maybe the problem is harder than it seems?",1403111931

7911284,comment,7909908,7909908,2,0,thaumaturgy,,,"On my way out the door, a handful of quick thoughts:<p>1. Most importantly, you&#x27;re <i>not</i> a broken person. This is the sort of thinking about mental problems that has to stop. If somebody had the flu, you wouldn&#x27;t refer to them as &quot;broken&quot;. Being depressed, even suicidal, shouldn&#x27;t be a factor in how employable you are. At the moment, you&#x27;re not making full use of your talents, but that happens to everyone sometimes.<p>2. You&#x27;ve recently had some major disruption in your life, and it sounds like you don&#x27;t have anyone to talk to about it. You refer to your girlfriend as your identity; that can make the end of the relationship especially brutal. This is why it&#x27;s so important to have a sense of self, an identity all your own, before getting into a serious relationship.<p>3. Most people are not equipped to deal with someone who&#x27;s depressed or suicidal, or even having an anxiety attack or any number of other mental illnesses. Don&#x27;t let your experience with your ex-colleague make you give up on talking to people. Talk to people about it. Use your best judgement.<p>4. This is why therapists exist. They are trained to have conversations like this and to help you sort things out. <i>However</i>, finding a therapist is a lot like finding a romantic partner -- it can be discouraging and it can take a lot of work before you find someone that&#x27;s compatible.<p>5. Depression (and other mental illnesses) and problems with sleep seem to be correlated. And, the middle of the night, when everything&#x27;s quiet and your mind is racing and there&#x27;s nobody to talk to is a bad time for people with depression. So, put some serious effort into getting good sleep for a while -- even if it means going to the market and picking up some over-the-counter sleep aids. Go to bed early, pass out, if at all possible sleep in without an alarm.<p>6. DO THINGS. Depression can spiral out of control when you&#x27;re locked away in your home, or just making quick errand runs. I can&#x27;t say whether or not you should quit your job. Maybe the job isn&#x27;t what you should be doing right now; maybe it is exactly what you need to be doing right now. I dunno. But, you need to be going out and doing things. New things are great things to do. If you have some savings, now might be a good time to spend some of it. It&#x27;s your rainy day fund, and it&#x27;s raining right now. You&#x27;re worth spending money on. Go somewhere you&#x27;ve wanted to go. Try something new. Get on meetup and float through some new groups. Re-connect with old friends or family you haven&#x27;t talked to in a while. You never know when something that you experience might change the way you feel about yourself and the world around you.<p>7. Depression, in my completely unprofessional opinion, is primarily a fault with the way a person perceives themselves and the world around them. It&#x27;s like a form of mental blindness: everything sucks, I suck, I&#x27;m a bad person, I&#x27;m worthless, the world would be better off without me, life is too hard, etc. These things are all <i>wrong</i>. If you can alter the way you see yourself and the way you see the world around you, your depression will improve. But it&#x27;s hard to do that by sitting in front of your computer.<p>8. You sound young. I don&#x27;t mean that to sound dismissive; rather, there&#x27;s a lot more life ahead of you, and you&#x27;ll be missing out on it. You&#x27;ve got at least another 10 years to meet someone great and raise that family you want; 10 years is a long time. (At least until you get to around 50 or so, then 10 years seems to go by pretty quick.) You have no idea who you might meet or what will happen in the next 10 years.<p>9. Don&#x27;t worry too much about your reputation. For breaking news: just say, &quot;I&#x27;ve been struggling with some pretty severe depression recently. I&#x27;m working on it.&quot; Really straightforward, matter-of-fact. Nothing to be ashamed of. Having frank conversations about it is a heck of a lot better than waking up dead one day.<p>Your post got a pile of comments.

7911250,comment,7910168,7910593,1,0,001sky,,,"I agree with the general tenor of this comment, but the idea that you need a &quot;citation&quot; is misplaced. The common practise of &quot;scalping&quot; was widespread (although not uniformly) and this is documented in various places. The speculation on the origin of what is essentially a slang word is speculative regarless of what side of the debate you want to argue--thus citation is irrelevant. Conversely, there was certainly an origin of the term, and lack of citation doesn&#x27;t support the term never had an origin (correctly understood or otherwise).<p>A variation of &quot;Red-skin&quot; also appears in the French Language (something there is no data to support Native Americans would have objected to, presumably). Again, this is neither here nor there in that french speaking canadiens would have been in contact with all manner of native americans, including those among which &#x27;scalping&#x27; took place (in terms of geographic an time period overlap etc).<p>editL<p>Just a cut-n-paste but might be helpful for some folks to baseline:<p><i>Redskin...had not emerged first in English or any European language. The English term, in fact, derived from Native American phrases involving the color red in combination with terms for flesh, skin, and man. These phrases were part of a racial vocabulary that Indians often used to designate themselves in opposition to others whom they (like the Europeans) called black, white, and so on.<p>But the language into which those terms for Indians were first translated <was French>. The tribes among whom the proto forms of redskin first appeared lived in the area of the upper Mississippi River called Illinois country. Their extensive contact with French-speaking colonists, before the French pulled out of North America, led to these phrases being translated, in the 1760s, more or less literally as peau-rouge and only then into English as redskin. It bears mentioning that many such translators were mixed-blood Indians.</i><p>So the original term in the west was &quot;peau-rouge&quot; and this can be see in various french-language citations if needed--including news reports. How and why this was used as slang in English is another question all together, and how or why it ended up as a mascot (like braves, warriors, spartans etc) another question again.",1403111491

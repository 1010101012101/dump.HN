There is no longer term gain to be had from it.<p>Currency devaluation doesn't make a nation wealthy. It doesn't make you more competitive. It doesn't create factories and jobs. It doesn't make your economy more productive. It doesn't spur innovation or business formation. It's a desperation move.<p>Japan has to import almost everything that their factories need. So while the claim that their exports will be more competitive is true short term, their costs will skyrocket alongside that and the net gain will be zero at best. Meanwhile you punish savers and consumers.<p>It's a bad Keynesian gimmick that won't save Japan. It's the last gasp of a dying experiment.<p>Japan turned to destroying the Yen because they have nothing left to eat before they start consuming muscle. 50% of their <i>tax collections</i> already go to debt maintenance. They're effectively bankrupt. Their savings rate has plunged compared to where it used to be. The Yen is all they have left to abuse before they have to start slashing the public sector directly; inflation is just another means of doing that.",1369021777

You can be ""over-optimized"" without being spammy.<p>Over-optimized refers to having your SEO optimized to rank for a very specific, targeted term.  Take ""trolling motors"" as that's the site of mine that was penalized.<p>Even if I built all my links via white hat, legi methods - but the anchor text of all the links to my home page said ""trolling motors"" - I'd likely be penalized.  That's because in a naturally linking backlink profile, people would link with a wide variety of different words, not just ""trolling motors"".  Because the concentration is so focused, it's almost a guarantee that someone was trying to game the system. Google algorithm updates like Penguin have really started cracking down where's it's obvious the owner is trying to rank for a word by optimizing the links, title, headings, copy in a way that appears dramatically non-natural.<p>Often, however, spammy link campaigns are also over optimized as well.<p>Hope this helps!",1369021079

Produce value for whom, and on what time scale? Selling fizzy sugar water at maximized production creates value in the short term, but is a clear loss for public health in the long. (Not arguing for or against soda; it's an example of a generalized pattern of wealth creation on paper, which actually represents destruction of real wealth in the actual world.)<p>Of course, a similar pattern re-occurs in politics (representatives capitulate to the wealthy on issues A, B, and C in order to earn the political capital to attempt something good with issue D). The liberal conceit of electing a Good Guy to fight the Bad Guys doesn't necessarily hold up to scrutiny, either.<p>There are plenty of points to disagree with about Ayn Rand's philosophy, but I come from the school that says you should understand deeply that which you dispute. The author clearly does not understand what Rand is trying to say.<p>> only to hand that money over to another set of people whose only claim is that they need it<p>One last point: there is an important distinction to be made between moochers and infrastructure. I oppose giving people (for instance) free education simply because they want it. I instead support free education because it maximizes economic production and reduces crime, which makes my dollar go farther and my life better.<p>Should we find a way to accomplish the benefits of commons through entirely voluntary means? You betcha. But until that utopia arrives, the rule of law is paid for with coercion.

Do I propose a solution to the problem or just post the problem?  If it's the former, my suggested solution may be too far reaching or not far reaching enough (teleportation vs make faster cars). If it's the latter, it may be easy to get people to agree a problem exists but hard to get them to agree on what a good solution would be.<p>Of the two, the latter is probably the better option.  Perhaps I list a pain point along with the amount I'd be willing to pay to have that problem solved.  Others do the same.  There's no tipping point because it's unlikely that by simply having a problem I'd also know how much it would cost to solve the problem.<p>At any point, users/companies with the skills to solve the problem can propose solutions along with their minimum funding requirements and relevant credentials.  I can select more than 1 solution and whichever solution reaches their minimum funding requirements first gets my pledge.<p>Or instead of trying to compete with kickstarter, this could simply be a step that happens before campaigns are launched on KS.

It's pretty reasonable to build a DDR3 memory controller into a Spartan3 or Cyclone4 and the ARM PMI bus. My sketch has the memory slaved to a DMA control dumping RGB888 into a Silicon Labs or TI HDMI 'phy' at the requisite rate to generate a 1080p/60 display. The thought being that the RAM would be 'display preferred' and processor access would be 'when available'. Not as nice as a direct memory interconnect but easy to add to pretty much anyone's standalone ARM chip. I was shooting for something like the Sun3 color framebuffer on the Sun 3/60 which was pretty easy to talk to an pretty much hard to imply I'm violating Patents since those documents are from the 80's.<p>I couldn't get it much below $15 though, it is a 3 chip solution (RAM / FPGA / Phy). The Zynq absorbs both the RAM and the FPGA so I'm left with the physical interface. And in the Zynq case I actually get two CPU cores so one could conceivably do a full 3D software implementation in one CPU and have the other one run Linux and talk to it via a simple in memory mailbox protocol.<p>The Zynq is also already soldered together and trying to get the Digilent plugon modules talking to the Spartan 3 dev board i had was looking dicey at best. :-) I can fantasize about Atmel doing a hard core of a simple Frame buffer but its not realistically in the 'likely' category.",1369020265

5735637,comment,5734333,5734333,24,0,cletus,,,"I, like many others, find this whole area deeply fascinating. I'm particularly perturbed by the Fermi Paradox [1]. On that note, another commenter mentions a KSR book that has a city moving around a latitude to keep a certain place relative to the Sun. Alastair Reynolds certainly had that earlier (in <i>Absolution Gap</i>).<p>I'm also reminded of Iain M. Banks' Outside Context Problem [2] in a number of different ways.<p>The first is that space seems, from the human perspective, to be impossible big with even the nearest things being almost impossibly distant. The optimists argue that technology will solve that problem (probably whilst imagining a Star Trek like future) but the laws of physics paint a far bleaker picture if you look at just the energy cost to get to our nearest neighbour even assuming you solve the reaction mass problem and have perfect mass to energy conversion, the problem that even the smallest piece of matter (and eventually even <i>hydrogen atoms</i>) become deadly obstacles at even a modest %c and so on.<p>The second is that given the abundance of planetary systems we've already detected, the size of the galaxy (and its age) and the very real possibility of constructing self-replicating machines with something not <i>that</i> much beyond our tech, it seems strange that we haven't seen evidence of this.<p>Anyway, back to interplanetary colonization... given the relative distance to Mercury (6-7 years at current tech for an orbital intercept) such a colony would of course be essentially cut off from the Earth so would need to be self-sufficient (saying nothing of the problem of building a colony ship that could even get people there and keep them alive for such a long period).<p>I think about it this way: what is the ""footprint"" of a single person in the developed world? By this I mean we all need food, power, material things and the like. For each of those things, add in all the people required to produce, deliver and service those and keep adding those people until you have a group that is independent and self-sustaining.<p>Primitive people have a relatively small footprint, requiring a relatively small group but a large amount of area per person.<p>In the developed world, to maintain anything like our current existence seemingly requires a good portion of the planet. That's a problem for any kind of colonization effort.<p>But at the same time that interdependence reduces (IMHO) conflict. Imagine a world where 100,000 people could be self-sufficient and effectively cut themselves off from the rest of the world? It seems like a recipe for disaster. It seems like a recipe for creating a technocratic elite and the kind of social divergence that would ultimately create a new species (at first culturally).<p>So for a Mercury colonization effort you'd need to take enough to establish heavy industry in a hostile environment (assuming you'd mine what you need rather than carry it there), build habitats, food production and so on. It quickly spirals into an impossibly large effort.<p>Colonization in human history to date has happened at far lower technological levels where transportation and communication were (compared to space travel) ridiculously cheap.<p>What we probably need is automated, self-replicating heavy industry. This way we send an initial package of robots to Mercury. They build energy sources, habitats, mines, etc without the huge cost of keeping humans alive. Need more robots? They build those too.<p>Sound familiar? You're only one step away from the self-replicating robots that can (and apparently haven't) colonized the galaxy.<p>So yes investing in impact defense seems prudent. I don't know what we could really do against something that's 20km across though. That's an awful lot of mass to move out of our way.<p>What we really need is something that is a large part of artificial intelligence and self-replicating machines to do our work for us. This seems to me like the key to our long term survival and something we'll need to spend significant effort into developing.<p>As an aside, I tend to agree that the desire to colonize Mars is somewhat misguided but, mistakenly or not, Mars shares a lot more in common with us than Mercury does. It has an atmosphere (although not a terribly useful one). The cold is something that we, as humans, can and do deal with. It's also closer to Earth (~8 months at the right time).<p>I personally find the rover effort to be useful as the basis for building machiens that can survive in hostile environments for long periods of time, if nothing else.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_paradox"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_paradox</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excession#Outside_Context_Problem"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excession#Outside_Context_Probl...</a>",1369019174

5735626,comment,5735345,5735345,6,0,cynicalkane,,,"Throughout history a reliable way to distinguish good economic thought from bad is to see what they reason about. Good economists reason from <i>ends</i>, viz., what they want an economy to accomplish. Bad economists reason from superficial results and moralities, viz., ""category X of people are too rich"" or ""I personally think something is wrong with the way money is structured, so let's tax it.""<p>And the nature of moral reasoning is that it substitutes for truth. You begin to believe things simply because they fit your narrative. But the nice thing about economics is we have data to show these things are wrong in elementary ways.<p>* The rich pay more taxes than the middle class. The ultra-rich pay fewer taxes than the ""ordinary"" rich by a few tenths of a percent.<p>* The marginal tax rate (including welfare, which you should) on the poor and lower-midde class is extremely high. Often the system actually penalizes you for working. By contrast, the most generous tax structure goes toward the middle and upper middle classes. Here it is, in one graph: <a href=""https://lh3.ggpht.com/-_-6Fsycanmw/ULO_5kk3fxI/AAAAAAAAAU4/y1PbUElDS34/s1600/marginal-tax_6.PNG"" rel=""nofollow"">https://lh3.ggpht.com/-_-6Fsycanmw/ULO_5kk3fxI/AAAAAAAAAU4/y...</a><p>* High corporate taxes disincentivize paying out shareholder wealth, and incentivize constantly-reinvesting behemoths. If you think corporations are too big, lower corporate taxes! Even ""socialist"" countries know this; the US has the highest corporate taxes in the developed world. They're the #1 reason Apple is sitting on a 12-figure cash pile, for example.<p>* I have no idea why the ""location"" of cash, offshore or onshore, even matters. It's just another vague handwavey accusation. Ooh, this cash is offshore, it must be <i>sinister</i>.<p>I can go on, but I'll stop. Here's the thing, though: I think taxes on the rich should be higher. I think corporations should be smaller. But it does an extraordinary disservice to this cause to peddle nonsense and push for more and more broken tax structures in the mistaken belief that the goal of the tax system is to punish the social classes and behaviors you don't like. The goal of the tax system is to provide for the general welfare. The best way to do this is in an equitable, progressive, even and sensible tax structure. Punishing specific behaviors is how you create the tax loopholes that the rich allegedly take advantage of (actually, the upper middle class is in best position to take advantage of these anyway).",1369018959

When the US Government decides to increase tax collection, it always wants to take from the rich and makes a big deal out of it. The rich always are driven into tax-free investments and keeping money in lower-tax areas of the world. The revenues do not materialize.<p>At this point, the government has a choice to make: will it keep trying to obtain the extra money where it can still be found? The answer is always yes, and it can always be found in payroll taxes and consumption taxes because they can so reliably be collected. This is how regressive taxes come about. They are always consequences of progressive taxes.<p>So, while I like the idea of the middle class paying a small payroll tax while, say, seven figure capital gains are taxed as income, I know that the result of that law is going to be a larger payroll tax, or a national electricity tax, or something like that.

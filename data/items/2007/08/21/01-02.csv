But I figure you guys know?<p>I want to learn programming, maybe not to be a full-fledged hacker, but to be able to understand the concepts and be able to talk about this stuff more with programmers so I can work in tech?<p>I hear python and ruby are good to learn on, but what would you guys do or are there any good books you'd read?<p>\n",1187661350

44571,comment,44259,44280,0,0,staunch,,,"I'm not sure about old stuff. I think rehashing old topics can be very interesting. You often learn something new about them. Reddit has never been strictly ""news"", even in its heyday.<p>Politics and religion are special, they're just such huge topics and they're so personal to people. There's a reason people don't discuss these topics in business much. They're big distractions from the many things we <i>all</i> have in common.<p>I hope there's a ban on purely political and/or religious topics. This isn't censorship: 1) It's not done by the government. 2) The purpose is maintain focus, not suppress ideas.\n",1187660257

In University I graduated near the top of my class (pats hand on back).  Ironically, I think that high school above all taught me that I wanted to do a start-up.  And even more ironically, I learned most of my math and English from my parents.  School however was essential in teaching me empathy, social interaction, and I met most of my friends there.",1187658595

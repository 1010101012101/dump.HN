The number of x&#x27;s in the parenthesis is still infinite (infinity minus 1 is still infinity). We already know by hypothesis that x^x^x^...=2. So we can substitute this in for the term in parenthesis since they are both an infinite tower of x&#x27;s and get: x^2=2.",1399143577

Whoever owns the road you drive on sets the rules; if you don&#x27;t abide by them, you can&#x27;t drive on that road because it&#x27;s private property. It&#x27;s already that way, really, it&#x27;s just that you don&#x27;t notice it because you see the state. If someone wishes to create a set of roads where people can drive recklessly, then others are free to use other roads that agree to their sense/level of security.<p>&quot;<i>What happens when someone breaks your stuff and can&#x27;t pay for it?</i>&quot;\nInsurance, on either side.

This assumption is wrong.<p>On one level, there is truth to what is stated--- but it correlates more to big company paths, people who have a conservative view on their ability to leave an impact on the world, and people who are narrowly focused on programming for programming&#x27;s sake.<p>It&#x27;s not about &quot;switching&quot; to management (this thinking is big company), it&#x27;s about taking your technical skills and making things happen. If that means you have to be a startup founder or a leader (CTO, CEO, VP engineering, whatever) who ends up not coding much anymore to make that happen, so be it. The point is if you love programming, do it, get amazing at it, solve real problems... and you&#x27;ll have limitless potential in the future.<p>Being a programmer/engineer gives you the ability to find and build real solutions to problems in the world. If you&#x27;re good, being able to build things = creating a startup or partnering with others to take on big things.<p>Regardless of statistics on the rate of success of startup endeavors, this potential and this opportunity make being a programmer completely worthwhile and rich with potential. You do <i>not</i> need to be a manager to have financial success. What you need is equity, equity that appreciates massively in a successful company. Financial outcome is a nice side effect of starting or joining a startup but not the only metric of success.<p>IMO, the more &quot;correct&quot; way of looking at a career as an engineer is what other smart people have blogged about. After graduating, join the best mid-level (in terms of size) startup you can (or hell, start your own). The relationships and the higher opportunity for rapid growth will serve you well down the road--- whether that means you&#x27;re an executive or still an engineer who codes.

That would need 533000 pulleys with 1 cm2 steel cable at 7500 kg tensile strength.  So 266000 pulleys on each end, which is a 2D array of about 512 pulleys on a side.  This doesn&#x27;t actually seem that difficult to build on an industrial scale.  The cable would travel about 2100 km a day, at 25 m/sec (about 55 mph).  The cable would have a total volume of 2100000/10000 = 210 m3, or 6 m on side (20 ft), with the ends connected to the opposite sides of the pulley system.  So that&#x27;s quite a spool at the generator.  It should be slightly mobile, either on wheels or a spring so that it can adjust to rogue waves.  Also it should probably be made from a polymer that&#x27;s resistant to seawater instead of steel.<p>Unfortunately we&#x27;d need 1000 of these plants to make 1 GW.

7691849,comment,7686039,7686039,2,0,dredmorbius,,,"The US Naval Research Laboratory&#x27;s electrically-powered fuel from seawater research appears vastly more viable than this project.  It&#x27;s been covered previously at HN.<p>Briefly:<p>• It creates aviation-quality fuel (long-chain liquid hydrocarbons equivalent to kerosene or diesel fuel, longer than those in gasoline) from electricity, hydrogen electrolyzed from seawater, and CO2 present at 140x atmospheric concentrations in seawater in both dissolved (2-3%) and bound (97-98%) forms as carbonate and biocarbonate.<p>• It utilizes two very-well established and understood principles:  electrolysis \nand Fischer-Tropsch process fuel synthesis.<p>• The novel aspect is also relatively conservative:  extraction of CO2 at industrial levels from water via partial vacuum and pH changes induced largely via electrolysis.<p>• Efficiency looks to be reasonable and largely governed by electrolysis at 60% in terms of net recoverable energy from H2.  Even if operational efficiency is only 10% of this it&#x27;s still 3.5x more efficient than the method described in the article here.<p>• Scale of operations envisioned is significant at 100,000 gallons/day.  Scaling this to national levels of present petroleum consumption strikes me as plausible, though not trivial or inexpensive.  Capital costs are not incommensurate with existing and projected petroleum capex spends (trillions of dollars), and may provide greater return in terms of net energy supply.<p>• Plant requirements are, as fuel synthesis schemes go, profoundly modest.  Rather than tens or hundreds of millions of hectares envisioned for biofuel schemes (along with freshwater and ag infrastructure requirements), a volume of roughly 10m x 4.5km x 4.5 km might provide US national liquid fuel needs.  At envisioned Navy deployment levels, the plant would occupy a modest industrial site or possibly a shipboard or floating platform (though not fit within existing warship envelopes while preserving combat operations capabilities).<p>• Power requirements at 100kgal/day are ~240 MW (roughly an aircraft carrier&#x27;s reactor output).  At national scale, about 2 TW, or equivalent to a solar collector surface of roughly 6,700 km^2 (82 km on a side).<p>• The process should be highly amenable to utilizing surplus generating capacity on an intermittent basis to create fuel.  It could be used for both electrical generation storage or for large-scale fuel synthesis.<p>• The technology isn&#x27;t inherently large-scale.  Smaller modular installations, or large centralized ones should, from an engineering perspective, be roughly equally viable, as contrasted, say, with nuclear technologies which are inherently centralized for engineering, safety, security, and operational reasons.<p>More:  <a href=""http://redd.it/22k71x"" rel=""nofollow"">http://redd.it/22k71x</a>",1399141674

The <i>relevant</i> volume is the area x the tidal displacement, which gives you the amount of water and how far it&#x27;s been lifted (average:  1/2 the total displacement).<p>Or, if you prefer to have someone do the math for you, the City of San Francisco and EPRI did an analysis of how much total energy could be derived from tidal flows in and out of the San Francisco Bay, which I became interested in after an Internet crank suggested that the rise and fall of 30 typical ships could power all of San Francisco.<p>Not hardly.<p><a href=""http://oceanenergy.epri.com/attachments/streamenergy/reports/006_CA_06-10_-06.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://oceanenergy.epri.com/attachments/streamenergy/reports...</a><p><i>The narrow passage under the Golden Gate Bridge, which connects the San Francisco bay to the Pacific Ocean is home to some of the most energetic currents in North America.

All combustion does - that is the end product of essentially all of the &#x27;carbon&#x27; in &#x27;hydrocarbon&#x27;.  Reducing CO2 requires reducing the amount of fossil fuels burned for energy.  Speaking as someone that has spent a lot of time on this area: There are no effective substitutes, at all, for reducing the amount of fossil fuels burned for energy.  Carbon capture & storage is a red herring with no long-term effective mechanism, a very limited temporary reservoir system, and energy companies that don&#x27;t even want to use <i>those</i> without the government writing them a huge check.  Affirmative carbon credits for things like forest-growing are very limited by nature (forests only take in so much), and more effective as a way of preserving ecosystems than reducing anthropogenic carbon - so far they&#x27;re mostly guilt-exemption tickets which change nothing about the degree of resource utilization happening.  Ocean seeding seems to sequester a lot less than we first expected, because other nutrients become bottlenecks.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I remain in favor of phasing out fossil fuels for most purposes, but they are really useful things, and we&#x27;re going to have to attempt to leapfrog the entire 20th century of mechanized technology in developing countries to do it, <i>after</i> we complete the process in our own economies.

7691732,comment,7691332,7691332,2,0,at-fates-hands,,,"The author has a point, and one of the keys here is that the hierarchy for developer is pretty flat. All the jobs I&#x27;ve had except one very small startup the structure was like this:<p>Entry Level Developer (coding 100% of the time)<p>Senior Developer (coding 50%, managing 50%)<p>Manager, Lead Developer, etc. (managing 100%)<p>from the time you take a senior position, you&#x27;re essentially being groomed to manage the team you&#x27;re on. Whether you&#x27;re another level between developers and your director/manager or simply the manager, you essentially stop coding.<p>I think this is the point. It&#x27;s not so much that programming is a dead end, the inherit structure of most companies is flat relative to the position. It&#x27;s an interesting idea, how do you give a guy seniority and a nice pay raise, without taking away what he probably loves to do? Obviously for most companies, it means increased responsibility and pay = managerial tasks.<p>For the last several years, I&#x27;ve been in this purgatory. I love programming, but every senior position means a reduction in my development role and an increase in managerial responsibility. The problem now is my skillset is at a place where I&#x27;m pretty much at the ceiling. It&#x27;s hard to say, &quot;I have a senior level skill set, but don&#x27;t want to be a manager.&quot; I know my two options are to either bite the bullet and get into management (which to me is like adult daycare) or start my own company.<p>As of now, I&#x27;m already laying the groundwork for a startup, so I can transition out and do my own thing in the next two years.",1399140242

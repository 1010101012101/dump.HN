So what can we do to alter the ways they interact so that each one leaves the site a better person than when they came?<p>The current design simply rewards stories that are the most popular. The problem with this is that there are basically four types of valuable stories: Insightful, interesting, informative, and funny (a la Slashdot).<p>In terms of what makes you a better person, the order is generally:<p>1. insightful<p>2. informative<p>3. interesting / funny<p>The problem is that the stories that are interesting and funny tend to get votes very quickly, driving the insightful and informative stories off the screen. (Partly this is because you can tell if something is interesting or funny from the headline, but you need to read the whole article before deciding if something is insightful.)<p>The are currently subreddits based on topics, but once again it's the interesting stories in each subreddit that are pushing out the insightful ones. If we have Anna Nicole Smith on the front page, then we have whatever the science equivalent of ANS is in science and the programming equivalent of ANS in programming. <p>So of course people aren't coming away from Reddit as better people. Because all the stories that would make them better people are being squelched because of the systemic forces of the system. I don't even read Reddit anymore for this reason.<p>It's not as if it can't be fixed though. Reddit has the stories it does because they designed the systemic forces to encourage those types of stories. They could just as easily be redesigned to encourage other types of stories.

7563,comment,7543,7543,0,0,sethjohn,,,"In the short run, lowbrow material can be quite successful. In the long run, though, quality wins out. People still read the classics, the Simpsons is still around because it's complex and smart.<p>I think the same is true of companies. There is a lot more value (both morally and monetarily) in building for long-term popularity (via quality) than in brief cheap thrills.<p>And so, specifically, I'm betting that YouTube will soon be replaced by sites that offer higher quality (production values, intellectual material, better organized) content...the popularity ""Farting in Public"" will soon pass!

7561,comment,7543,7543,0,0,randallsquared,,,"It just takes longer to evaluate the worth of a novel than the worth of a blog post, so if you read only novels, it might be weeks before you find one you really like, but if you're reading blog posts, you're likely to find something you really like later today.  For equally good blog posts and novels, the worth of the novel is less than the proportionately longer length would suggest.",1175264708

7558,comment,7543,7543,0,0,divia,,,"If the reddit recommendation engine ever gets really good, I think it could actually be part of the solution, not the problem.  As Aaron quotes, ""people tend to be extremely similar in their vulgar and prurient and dumb interests and wildly different in their refined and aesthetic and noble interests.""  If we take the quote to be true, then looking at the most popular news items will always be problematic, but people will still need a way to find what interests them.    ",1175264186

PG said that Google was only good at stuff that worked for hackers, but I bet it could parlay its Gmail userbase into a Zenter-killing web-based Powerpoint, even though hackers don't generally do that much powerpoint.

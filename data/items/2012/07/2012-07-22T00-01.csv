4276155,comment,4276022,4276022,1,0,superqd,,,"Make the patent term proportional to the value of the disclosure contained in the patent.  That is, the value of the claims in the patent should dictate the length of the patent term.  We could crowd source the value.  the USPTO can list ""here's the problem"" and ask for estimated values.  Or, the patentee could suggest the patent term, and then the USPTO discloses the problem solved by the patent (or the new thing you can do because of it), along with how much the inventor is asking (in months).  We create a threshold that must be reached in order for the term to be granted.  Example, you invent a new compression algorithm for video, and file a patent.  The USPTO publishes the following (simple version):<p>""A patent to compress video by an average of 8x over current state of the art algorithms.<p>Inventor seeks 240 months of protection for disclosure of the algorithm.<p>[ ] Worth it  [ ] Not worth it""<p>If we set the threshold at X thousand, or Y % of those in the sample, then the inventor can get the patent protection for 240 months.  This could be done as the very first step.  So if value-less inventions are applied for protection, they could be screened out without draining resources.<p>Alternatively, you could do something more like a market value approach, and ask folks how many months of protection the invention would be worth, and take an average of the most commonly suggested amounts (in terms of months).<p>The point is, there are much better alternatives than a fixed N years of protection for any invention of a particular category.  Not all inventions are equally valuable, so it doesn't make sense to price them by category any more than it does to price them (in years of protection) the way they are now (everything's equal to 20 years of protection).<p>So, rather than wait for the market to validate the patent after it's been granted (which wastes USPTO resources), let's validate it's value ahead of time. If no one thinks it's worth much, the inventor may abandon the claim.  Or the USPTO can reject it outright as not meeting the utility criterion since the estimated value (by society) is too low.",1342918567

4276139,comment,4275140,4276045,6,0,wallflower,,,"> Is there any literature on portfolio-based hiring?<p>From the world of higher learning, the emphasis on portfolios is well-known. The interesting thing to emphasize is that the focus is on long-term development - e.g. have you become a <i>better</i> researcher or teacher over time.<p>Remember, we don't want someone with 7 years of experience if those 7 years were spent doing the same thing, not getting better/learning more skills.<p>I think this is something that checklist-based interviewing fails to uncover. Behavioral-based interviewing (e.g. STAR) does better but it forces the candidate to know that this evidence of programming maturity over time is what is being probed for (if it is). Whiteboard-based interviewing is probably the best but it requires dedicated interviewing by engineers and there are flaws to it (emphasis on reducing false positives v. false negatives)<p>> ""In the section where I describe the various courses I have taught, I include several sentences that detail how both my successes and my failures in one course led to improvements in subsequent semesters. I refer to this development in my statement of teaching philosophy as well, but in the teaching portfolio I can point directly to the evidence of those improvements in sample syllabi."" [1]<p>> ""In some ways, it's like a two-year-long take-home exam,"" says A. Mitchell Fraas, a graduate student in Duke's history department. When the system was introduced, in 2005, he and his peers could opt to complete either a portfolio or the traditional exams. Mr. Fraas chose the portfolio, he says, because it offered a measure of control and a permanent record of his progress.<p>""I liked the sense of being able to see in a tangible format everything I was doing working up to exams,"" he says, ""rather than blurting stuff out in a four-hour oral and never seeing it again, or scribbling something down on a 24-hour exam.""<p>Felicity M. Turner, a fifth-year graduate student in the department, says the portfolio gave her an opportunity to revise her papers and think through an issue until she was happy with the result. In the portfolio model, she says, ""the responsibility is on you to formulate your own argument, so the process of creation is yours.""

In the article's solution, E(egg2) is dependent upon which interval egg2 is dropped in -- if egg1 breaks on the first drop, E(egg2)=7 (the center of the 1-13 interval) but if egg1 breaks on floor 100, E(egg2)=0 since we already know floor 99 is safe.<p>To calculate E(egg1 + egg2) we need to compute something resembling a weighted average.

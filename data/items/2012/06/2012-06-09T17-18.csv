4088664,comment,4087811,4088484,4,0,irahul,,,"> Gender bias is a touchy subject in these tech blogs and the responses to this (yet another) article are, predictably, dismissive. It was one person's fault, there's no widespread gender bias, the instructor should have things differently, someone has seen women be jerks too, etc.<p>It was one person's fault, the instructor should have done things differently, some women are jerks(just like some men). The way you are enumerating says you don't believe they are true, when they are. As for ""widespread gender bias"", I don't know. I haven't seen it in action myself(I have seen the reverse though - women getting preferential treatment). I am not denying it - I am just saying I am not in a position to confirm or deny.<p>> So while there really does seem to be a measurable, observable difference in gender involvement in computing (e.g. in CS enrollments, in working in the industry, etc), these anecdotes always get tossed as not significant.<p>High school kids get into CS enrollments. I would love to hear from them why they don't go for CS enrollments, rather than hearing speculations. I have heard students complaining about nerdy culture, more demanding courses, low grades, low female to male ratio(circular - if you don't come in, it's going to be always low), anti-social(non-party) students etc. Do you believe girls don't enroll in CS courses because they believe there male counterparts will discriminate against them? If so, can you please provide me some citations.<p>>  Like, what sorts of articles would people _not_ jump on the bandwagon to tear to shreds?<p>The sort of articles where the conclusion follows from the antecedents.<p>1. I volunteered to teach a women's only class.<p>1.5 It was going well. Some young girl, who was doing well, just giggled and told me she has no idea what she is doing.<p>2. Some Dave walked in and derailed it.<p>3. I got angry, but the women just tuned out.<p>4. Hence, gender bias is real.<p>How does 4 follow from any of it?",1339264465

In this very discussion, there any several posters who are disregarding the OPs experience so that their opinions about sexism and male dominance in the classroom aren't challenged.<p>The fact of the matter is this classroom was an audience of (mostly) women who had selected an environment that would have almost none or no men attending. We can't simply blame that audience and teacher for not standing up to an aggressive male when the whole point of this kind of class to leave those people out in the first place.

Our first iteration just checked for the existence of the node, but that turned out to be a problem if the node was large and had several sub-nodes.  A second iteration checked that the node existed and had a nextSibling.  This meant that the node had completed loading and parsing and the browser was now on to the next node.<p>This implementation naturally needed polling of the DOM, but YUI's always been pretty smart about clubbing polling events together, and not doing too much at the same time.<p>Combined with the fact that you only need to load the YUI bootstrap code up front and let everything else load asynchronously, this can significantly reduce download time.<p>I only wish YUI 2 had a better syntax that might have made it more popular.

There is a substantial difference between my framing of the problem and the way others frame it. I did mention my condition but only in shorthand. I have CF -- cystic fibrosis -- a deadly genetic disorder which accounts for around a third of all adult lung transplants and half of all pediatric lung transplants in the US.<p>What I found is that life is chemistry. Everything we eat, drink, breathe or touch impacts our biochemistry and what germs we are exposed to and so on. Making many small choices throughout the day has a cumulative impact on body chemistry. I was able to reverse the pathology of my condition and make my body work closer to normal. Dietary changes were a big part of that but far from ""everything"".<p>Getting myself well took everything I had. I ended up deeply in debt because of it. I am currently homeless, trying to declare bankruptcy and trying to figure how to make money online so I can stay well. Having a desk job in an industrial park was part of what was keeping me ill.<p>Anyway, I hope that is a little clearer for you. My real message was intended to be that taking care of problems while they are small is more effective at really fixing things than hunting for big, dramatic ego boosting solutions. Doctors pay little attention to nutrition for people like me, though it makes a big difference in outcomes. Lung transplants grab more headlines and glory than trying to help people keep their own lungs functional and healthy.<p>Peace.",1339263933

Why do I say this?  Because opening your mouth beyond that could open you up for liability and the labor department is as anti-business as can be.<p>I had a really bad experience with a sales guy I hired some time ago.  The standard deal was 90 days probation.  We signed a very detailed contract upon employment that spelled out the terms.  The contract was authored by my attorney and was fully legal in California.  The basics of it were that he would get an advance on commissions as part of his weekly pay.<p>This is common practice with sales people.  In order to provide them with a minimum stable income you state their base pay and then negotiate an advance on future commissions.  The idea is that once they start selling they pay you back for the advance.  In this case, the advance was $1,000 per week.  Put another way, he owed me $1,000 per week and had to pay it back out of future sales commission.  It's a trust relationship:  I give you money you have not earned trusting that you'll work hard to repay it and actually earn beyond that.<p>To clarify, this sales person was not getting paid $1,000 per week.  His weekly paycheck included a base salary plus the $1,000 advance.<p>Well, he sold a net total of $0 in six months of employment.  I should have let him go at the 90 day period but that would have been the holiday season and, back then, I was a sucker for not doing that to people with families.  I've been on the receiving end of loosing my job at the end of the year and just didn't want to do that to others.  Fucking sap I was.<p>I had a stern talk with him and wished him happy holidays.<p>Once back he didn't sell a thing for three more months.  I let him go and gave him a full explanation as to why.  I also did the math and figured out that he owed me nearly $26K in unearned commissions.  Keep in mind, this was a loan, from me to him, based on the agreement that he would pay it back as he started to earn commissions from sales.<p>Again, being a fucking sap, I told him that I would simply not pay him his last two weeks and be done with it.  That amounted to recovering just a few thousand dollars.<p>A couple of months later I find myself in a hearing at the Labor Board.  Contract in hand, I assume that this is a done deal.  I produced the signed multi-page contract.  He admitted to knowing all about it and understanding the terms.  I presented a balance sheet showing the math and that he owed me over twenty thousand dollars but was willing to call it even and move on.  We would hear the decision within two weeks of the hearing.<p>Two weeks later I get a letter ordering me to pay him $5,000!<p>I consulted with my attorney.  He said that we could go after the labor board for failing to honor a legally binding contract and win.  However, he said, this is going to cost you far more than $5,000.  Ten times that much, if you are lucky.  ""Pay the guy and move on"".  So I did and learned a few very valuable lessons.<p>This, BTW, to get a little political, is one of the ways votes are bought in this country.  We hear of corrupt regimes in other countries.

That guy, the ace sales guy, will remember the extra five grand he got at my expense and will bend over backwards to support the party who got him that.  The problem is that they don't understand (voters and party) that they are destroying jobs.<p>President Obama is a cool guy, but if someone from another planet were to draw conclusions based on his speeches they'd conclude that the only important people in the US are ""teachers, police, fireman and construction workers"", or, put another way ""unions, unions, unions, and unions"".  Crock of shit.<p>Having a manual might be a good idea.  An even better idea is to have a good relationship with your attorney.  In some industries you will need him/her often.  Thankfully this was a corner case for me.  I've never had other issues with the people I've hired.  Most professionals are exactly that, responsible and hard working pros.  I am quite liberal with my relationship with those who work for me when we all behave as responsible pros.  For example, one time I encouraged my marketing manager to take a paid week off to go see a band she loved in the UK.  That paid week did not come out of her vacation time.  I paid for it because she was doing a good job and thought it'd be nice to show my appreciation this way.  I am happy to say that I have many examples like that.",1339263077

But aside from examples like that, I think this might not meet the cost/benefit requirements of most potential customers. That said, I already can think of a self contained task I want to ask you guys about.",1339261615

A big part of getting myself well involved eating at restaurants and tipping the wait staff well in preference to spending time in doctor's offices. People react to the ""news"" that I got well with either treating me like some hugely inspiring figure or calling me a liar and charlatan to my face. It is very clear to me I know something of value to the world and have made a real difference in the lives of some people. Yet I cannot figure out how to monetize it and I have spent some years trying to figure out how to just talk about it without flame wars breaking out.<p>In my experience, the big problems need ""small"" solutions. I got well by gradually walking away from the hard hitting drugs whose overwhelming strength hit my body just as hard as it hit my medical problems. The pursuit of the hard hitting solutions strikes me as rooted in fear and reflective of inelegant mental models.<p>""I love Lucy"" was the ""Star Wars"" of its day in terms of revolutionizing an industry. I suspect it also helped combat racism in this country. Lucille Ball was originally told they would not cast her Cuban husband in the role, that no one would believe that. I think they took the show on the road to build their case that audiences would accept it and she did eventually get her way.<p>Did she set out to change an industry or combat racism? No. She wanted her husband on the show to try to save her marriage and finally have kids. This industry changing TV show was a lifestyle business. They did finally have kids but ultimately divorced.<p>Having ""cured CF"" (so to speak) and mostly gotten spat on by the world for trying to share such info, my hope is that I can eventually do a web comic. I think humor is a far more palatable means to share wisdom than trying to ""help"" people. Solving serious problems that run deep tends to be too threatening to people. Entertaining them, making them laugh and incidentally causing them to think seems to be a more powerful and effective means to really change minds.<p>I continue to wrestle with such questions. But I think the most elegant solutions make light of problems. I only hope I can resolve my problems well enough so I only need worry about ""unimportant"" problems. That would be a truly amazing accomplishment given my history (and genetic disorder).",1339261593

Being able to plug in your own values into a single method call via the REPL isn't helpful if you're trying to analyze what really happens when it runs. Either you need to run it under a debugger, or manually trace it through. In a static language you just have to read the type signatures.",1339261537

The console itself is just awful compared to what you have available on a real, POSIX-compatible OS (Linux, OSX, etc).<p>This extends to SSH apps, too. Putty? Seriously? And implementations of tabbed and paned shells (the few you can choose from on Windows) are terribly ugly and clunky.<p>Windows 7 (and presumably 8) is a fine OS. I really had no beef with it. But as an engineer I spend far too much time at a command prompt to ever consider going back.<p>Also -- you don't boot your VM every time you want to use it. You keep it running in the background. Allocate 256MB of memory to it and forget it until you need to use a real shell.",1339261224

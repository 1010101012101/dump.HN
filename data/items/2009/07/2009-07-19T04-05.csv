712617,comment,712269,712538,0,0,gojomo,,,"You're right; that's sloppy writing in Morris's column. The wording is clearer in the book, which I just looked up via Amazon's search-inside-the-book. From p. 109:<p><i>When government bureaucrats ration health care, the results can be a disaster. Take the grim story of colon cancer in Canada. Colorectal cancer rates are much higher in Canada (6.7 per 100,000). than in the United States (4.8 per 100,000.) And although 41 percent of cases in Canada prove fatal, only 34 percent in the United States lead to death.<p>Even though colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of death in Canada, the drug Avastin -- the standard treatment in the United States -- is not available to patients in Canada through the government health system. ""What is going on in Canada is shameful,"" says Barry D. Stein, president of the Colorectal Cancer Association of Canada. ""This treatment, which was finally approved last year in Canada and which was long overdue, is not reaching patients who are desperately in need of... a treatment which is the standard of care in the treatment of the disease.""</i><p>My point is mainly there are lots of ways to ration -- dragging out both approval and access save money, at the margin, but also result in earlier deaths, at the margin. There are tradeoffs in any system. Some USians would like the Canadian system; some Canadians have to come to the US for treatments.<p>And especially with regard to the US system, there are big externalities and innovation effects. Canada and the rest of the world get giant positive externalities from the drugs and treatments developed first in the USA's expensive, competitive market. It may be economically rational to dilly-dally on advanced techniques when some other market is leading the way; or to drive a national hard-bargain to get drugs near the cost of production when the drug is already developed. But if every country lags, and every country squeezes all the profit out of medicine, the whole world will suffer from resulting the dearth of innovation.",1247979340

The marketing cost is a direct result of the huge cost of getting a basic research breakthrough moved all the way through the process to a safe and effective treatment that has FDA approval.<p>> the vast majority of the research goes into treatments rather than cures, because the former makes money and the latter does not.<p>[citation needed]<p>This sort of conspiracy-theory bullshit is really annoying because it fails even the most basic logical analysis.  If company A develops a treatment for a disease then it will be able to make more over the long-term than company B which develops a cure for a disease.  But if company A develops a treatment and two years after it gets through testing company B comes up with a cure for that same disease then company A is going to lose a boatload of money.  The only way this would work is if these companies were acting as a colluding cartel, and so far all evidence seems to indicate that the companies hate each other even more than we hate them.<p>> The world would be better off without American drug companies dominating the market, even if it meant no Viagra.<p>I happily invite you to try to live the remainder of your life eschewing treatments developed by American drug companies.  Viagra may make a nice whipping-boy for your tirades, but you do know that it was developed when stage 2 testing for an angina drug revealed its more popular side-effect, right?

In fact, the moment you see that, it's impossible <i>not</i> to let go - the same way you'd drop a red hot poker when you figured out you were holding one.<p>I can see why this idea makes you angry if you interpret it as expecting people to ""just accept"" violence, abuse and so on. And I can see why it would sound like blaming the victim.<p>Respectfully, though, it's not about accepting such things, it's about the effective way to <i>reject</i> them. 
The trouble with many of the obvious strategies for rejecting abuse is that they are deceptive: they cause one to unwittingly perpetuate it. You can easily end up inflicting more pain on yourself by reconducting the abuse in your imagination than the original experience entailed. You can also easily end up inflicting pain on people you love.<p>The cycle of violence is a strange game, the rules of which don't work the way you (I mean anyone) would think they ought to. Just the fact that so many victims turn into victimizers is a pretty big indicator of that. The important question is, when one finds oneself in a game like that, what's the way out?",1247978134

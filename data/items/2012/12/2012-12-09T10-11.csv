You can have millions of Scala actors.<p>><i>Goroutines are cheap: each goroutine starts at a size of 4k, and creating them is a really cheap operation.</i><p>Yes, but handling and migrating them is a ""not really cheap operation"". They are mostly useful as abstractions, as for performance you don't get anything over Java (if not worse: checkout Go vs Java concurrency benchmarks).<p>><i>Please show me a Java thread implementation with the same properties.

4894417,comment,4893915,4894135,4,0,bcbrown,,,"What I have learned from individual athletic competition is that the person who wins is usually the person who is willing to sacrifice the most in order to win - free time, hobbies, family and social relationships, health. I think that's probably true for anything. This is only possible for something that is a deeply held passion.<p>At the same time, by making an inviolable commitment to myself that I was going to enter a certain competition, and accepting as a given that I would be making certain sacrifices in my social and personal life from the training effort required, it made that commitment into something that I just did, without thinking about whether it was something I wanted to do at that moment. And removing that decision, that ""do I really want to do this chore?"", it's possible to have the consistency of effort necessary for performance at an elite level.<p>So I think it's valuable advice, to say start small, attempt surmountable obstacles, and develop the habit of consistent practice. And I think it's valuable to let people know that if they have an ambition to be an ""iconic computer person"", they will have to make large sacrifices.<p>I know that I'm not willing to sacrifice everything else in my life for programming. And I'm alright with that. But I don't criticize the people who have the drive to spend 15-18 on their passion. It's certainly not advice that's widely applicable, though.",1355050404

I mean it can be argued what is the best looking logo. I think they are taking something from the USA Today rebranding with that giant circle.<p>I used to work in higher education, and the web is amazingly decentralized at large universities and that means look and feel are often as well. It is very hard to police or even gain the power to police look and feel across multiple faculties, departments, and associations, so you have to provide them with a template that allows some freedom. Think of it as the tug-of-war between state and federal laws.<p>Often the team in charge of the top level domain will be in charge of look and feel but are given surprisingly little resources. They often can't attract top web-talent because they can't compete on wage and excitement (but can slay on benefits and working hours). They would probably have had to fought for years with higher ups to get a 1 time pool of money to do this re-branding initiative, but often after that is gone so does the upkeep, and evolution of the brand.<p>I was involved on a large re-branding committee almost the exact same as this. They paid big money for what was considered a goofy tag line. Students immediately graffiti'ed jokes and wrote protest articles about it. But years later with the new undergrads now graduating under it, it has stuck, and from what I can tell has been successful. Same thing will happen here, it is to attract and brand to a new generation.<p>Also they will still have a classic seal, that won't go away.

Give context and you'll find the experts there mostly willing to help.<p>There are different types of cable companies, but things you need to know are:
1) Coax costs more than fiber optics
You might think this is a stupid statement but when you are rolling out over a wide area you will find this. Look at GPON technology, even small community cable companies in Spain are using this advanced technology.
2) You either use digital TV or IPTV technology to deliver the channels. Digital TV (like DVB-C), will allow you to use a lot of legacy technology but it will leave you stuck in a legacy quickly. IPTV will require using all new hardware but that hardware may be cheaper to invest.
3) TV networks often need heavy constraints on content security (encryption and DRM), don't think that you can change the world, the Hollywood/MLB/NFL/NHL/Premier League lawyers won't budge and even the TV networks have to bow to the rights holders. If you don't have security built in then you will fail to get content, poor security will result in you having to do a major swap out which could bankrupt you.
3) IPTV should be multicast in order to reduce the costs of delivery on the network.
4) You will need a <i>big</i> internet connection.
5) Employ some people who know what they are doing already, there are lots of semi-retired engineers who can help you achieve what you want and they needn't cost you the earth. Again, check LinkedIn for this.",1355048633

But my brain has seemingly disparate modes for Vim and Emacs that are weirdly incompatible to each other.<p>Also, it helps to reimplement your favorite commands in Emacs. For example,  I have M-s and M-r bound to something like f/F in Vim. Similarly, M-o and C-o act like o/O.",1355047644

I've also noticed a tendency toward trying very hard to make your coworkers look stupid rather than trying to look smart by actually accomplishing things.<p>I'm sure it depends on where you're working, but there seems to be a lot of that Marissa Mayer ""excellence means putting other people down"" attitude. And because of that, there is a lot of mediocre talent at Google despite its reputation.<p>I have no idea whether any of this has to do with Guido's decision, a lot of engineers like to change jobs for all sorts of reasons, sometimes for the sake of it, but I'd probably prefer Dropbox to Google as well.",1355047329

Ask the Rust community to stop trying to outdo the Haskell community at propagandizing (hi dons!)<p>Again, I'm not clear where you see proselityzing in my post. Maybe there was something unclear about the way I wrote, but the idea was to take something ill-defined (the C# dialect in question) and compare it to something with clearly defined semantics which has been discussed here before. I've made no claim at superiority of one approach against the other. Considering how little there is in the article, it would have been silly even if I had been so inclined.<p>> 3. Start building things in Rust and show HN. A brief blog post describing pros/cons/future improvements would be boss.<p>Again, you seem to be reading more in my post than what I wrote. That said, and to address the point you raise here, the big problem with Rust until now is the syntax and feature sets has undergone significant changes between point releases, which is not an incentive to spend a lot of man-hours working on it just yet.",1355047289

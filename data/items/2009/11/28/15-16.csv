It'd be nice if things were more rigorous, but there are systematic limitations--e.g., triple checking someone else's work and not finding any problems does not advance one's scientific career. It tends to work out well enough most of the time, though.<p><i>In any field there are usually different factions of experts and you should consider all positions. If all experts agree (!) then assuming that position is probably not going to materially affect you even if they are not exactly on the right path.</i><p>Really? I can't actually think of any scientific fields with significant factional divides. Disagreements over trivia, perhaps (such as quantum mechanical interpretations), but nothing major. Disputes over major issues in science tend to be worked out pretty quickly, rarely persisting as stable factions. And yes, on the current topic, experts in climatology do pretty consistently agree on the science (proposed political ""solutions"" are another matter entirely...). What did you have in mind?<p>Factional wars may crop up around the fringes in fields that are only partially scientific, but it's typically parts of the field that are especially difficult to study scientifically that the factions split over.<p><i>Often it takes outsiders to shake up a field.</i><p>Often? Really? Do you have any examples? The only significant shakeups in science that I can think of were started by people trained and acknowledged in the field (though typically young, obscure researchers, not famous and influential scientists).<p><i>Personally I'm with ""House"", assume everyone is lying (or at least wrong) and you're usually right.</i><p>In matters of science, everyone is wrong, but some are less wrong than others.",1259423957

965221,comment,963664,964119,0,0,mmt,,,"<i>If you drive a prius with a thought toward efficiency it is quite good. If you are a pedal masher it won't be so good.</i><p>I have found this to be true for any car. The question for hybrids is if it's any more or less so. That is, is the effect of a ""lead foot"" more or less pronounced on average fuel consumption when compared to a non-hybrid economy car?<p>My anecdotal experience with economy cars versus a similarly small, ""sportier"" car (Honda Prelude) is that efficient driving has more effect on the the latter (17 to 30 mpg, factor of 1.76) than on economy cars (25 to 36 mpg, factor of 1.44)<p><i>they would fail modern emissions tests miserably, but cheap and efficient they nailed</i><p>IIRC, the high-efficiency ""HF"" version of the 80s Honda Civic CRX typically got 45-50mpg, with the same caveat that it couldn't be produced today due to more stringent emissions standards and the added one that it only had two seats.",1259423639

As long as you have an original good idea for business, you don't need to move to india (or anywhere else) to make it successful.<p>I guess my main beef with this feel-good, nationalistic, let's-all-go-to-india movement is that whether you like it or not - regardless of your original intentions - this will only benefit the elite few, the rich will get richer and poor will remain where they were before you went to india hoping to make a difference.<p>Indian doesn't need an influx of ex-pats to go to india to make a difference, they have plenty of smart people there already, they need a change in corrupt culture of government bureaucracy and outreach of social development that reaches way beyond the western-looking city landscapes.<p>They got their priorities wrong.",1259423409

965216,comment,965048,965048,0,0,maddalab,,,"As someone who grew up in India, studied and worked and the US and who spent 6 months attempting to help my previous employer set up an off site development centre at a third party vendor, before returning to the US, here is my perspective.<p>Management culture is not controlling or assertive in a manner any different than that practised at my US employer. The differences are mostly in response to such assertiveness, Indians tend to typically approach such assertiveness by authority with mere acceptance without necessarily understanding the reason underlying the decision. Such management assertiveness I have found to be misguided with the same rate at both locations.<p>Management response to highlighting inefficiencies in work culture or ineffectiveness with regards to output is specific to the organization, and in my experience I found the response to be similar, hide inefficiencies rather than work towards improvements.<p>I do not think I would find it difficult to go ""home"" (I consider US to be my home now), I would only need to find an organization that has the same first principles of continuous (personal and profession) improvement as I do.<p>Finding such an organization in either nation would be similarly difficult or easy.",1259423326

965211,comment,965155,965205,0,0,cwan,,,"I agree - the remedy is transparency and to understand how, where and when these models are used - especially if they're being used to form significant public policy as is the case here. It seems reasonable to believe that the code was used for some purpose - even if it was dummy data - but clearly questions remain that should be asked and answered.  What makes it even more troubling is the attitude of engagement of these scientists as if they are above being questioned when it is now revealed their emails suggest doubt, evasion and even suppression of valid but differing studies.<p>I've come to believe that AGW probably exists but am not married to the idea either - but nor am I convinced we need massive corrective policy versus adaptation (heck - I live in Canada after all, and after last winter we could use a little warming).

I can't help but feel that the anti-warming crowd (which includes ESR if I remember correctly, he wrote some long rant about peak oil?) is trying to blow a tiny mite up to be an elephant. It's typical revisionist behavior, just like the creationists who find a small bone that is not where biologists have predicted it would be, and they think they have refuted Darwin.<p>In any case, this all seems to be very ad hominem (revisionists trying to discredit scientists instead of providing data).

It really comes down to two things.<p>1) Work culture - Indian work culture, for the most part is not same as the work culture in the US.

I can only imagine what it must be like in bureaucratic government agencies in India.<p>2) Infrastructure and Equality - Its just not there. It might be sprouting or even maturing in certain places but for the most part, there is immense red tape and corruption in India. This is common for most developing countries and until the average minimum wage in India for a low level government official is somewhat closer to something decent, the bribery and favourism will continue and ambitious programs like these will continue to fail.

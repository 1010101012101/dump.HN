10483475,comment,10469189,10482862,0,0,sridca,,,"> I think that your comments are mean and inconsiderate. I agree that appealing to the authority of Webster on the question, &quot;what is love?&quot; is capricious and demeaning.<p>Does it have this to be this complicated for you? I have been being as considerate as I can of human suffering while engaging with my fellow humans being here asking them why they are so reluctant to question an emotion/feeling that brings so much pain, as is evident from Jesse&#x27;s post, all throughout human history.<p>Most people have no qualms with seeing love as a feeling, especially while they mourn in the death bed of their love one, or grief over the loss/rejection of their love object. These feelings are real; they are not merely &quot;thoughts&quot; or &quot;acts&quot;. Suffering is a feeling experience.<p>When you redefine such a core emotion/feeling to be an act, it renders all conversation around it void. From here then there are only two courses of actions: cease conversing, or establish a common ground of understanding before proceeding. I find it somewhat odd that you seem to grasp that a &quot;feeling is not the word itself&quot; (implied from the linked YouTube video) and yet have trouble seeing a feeling as ... a feeling.<p>Feelings are not thoughts. Feelings are not behavioural acts.<p>I experienced no &quot;sudden and unaccountable changes of mood or behaviour&quot; (which is what capricious means) or intended to demean anyone - as my responses have been no more than a simple pointing out of the above fact.<p>On the other hand I have random strangers on the internet making uncivil and pretentious remarks such as &quot;You don&#x27;t understand. You&#x27;re actually stuck. You can&#x27;t see it because you&#x27;re stuck.&quot; ... all because I question a cherished feeling?<p>> To reconstruct my point, I meant that, for example, when you say, &quot;I love you,&quot; make &#x27;love&#x27; a verb in the present tense in your mind. Love willingness and with abandon. Notice, by the by, that the way that we use the word &quot;love&quot; in casual conversation is often as a verb, not a noun. You never say, &quot;I happiness you&quot; <=- that syntax doesn&#x27;t make sense for a feeling. And love isn&#x27;t one. I submit that the impetus to misconstrue a beautiful act as an emotion is mostly a commercial one.<p>Have you not ever felt, for example, affection (a gentle feeling of fondness or liking) towards someone without necessarily involving any behavioural act or thought? Have you not ever grieved over the loss of someone you loved?",1446314333

You should work in education, there&#x27;s plenty of people like that there.<p>The child <i>could</i> in fact become horribly confused about multiplication because of a bullshit technicality, and this could set them back months. Or the child could be certain they&#x27;re right and this breaks trust in authority -- non-obedient children are not inherently bad, but without careful handling they can become extremely aggressive.<p>I certainly relate. In fact, you can fairly easily identify, in all these comments, who has experienced similar BS and who is knee-deep stuck in theory without understanding the human component behind it (looking at you, pohl).<p>The child doesn&#x27;t see the -1 and think &quot;Oh, I immediately understand why my answer is wrong! Of course, I understood 3 groups of 5 instead of 5 groups of 3!&quot;. No, the child sees it, thinks &quot;but you told me they&#x27;re the same? ok...&quot;, and is now more confused than ever about what&#x27;s actually been taught in the class. Most 9 year olds don&#x27;t know how to introspect.<p>Urgh. The comments here are so infuriating <i>because</i> this complete disconnect is exactly the same as the one the people behind the design of the most atrocious curriculums and methods have! Damn it, who here is actually taking into account <i>their own age</i> compared to the kid?

10483467,comment,10483354,10483379,0,0,vezzy-fnord,,,"Your understanding is, I&#x27;m sorry if this comes across as hostile, absolute nonsense. You should actually consult the literature instead of reading Linus Torvalds rants.<p>Back in 1990, the Amoeba system revealed 2x improvement in throughput and 5x improvement in latency for its RPC over the SunRPC of the time. [1] Relative measurements for the V-System and Sprite were similar. QNX, a microkernel-based system with high commercial success and a long history (used by over 40 automotive manufacturers) has highly fast IPC by integrating message passing with the CPU scheduler. After years of research, Jochann Liedtke introduced L4 in 1996 [2] using only seven generalized calls with a 20x improvement in speed over prior art such as Mach. Mach, by the way, is the glaring exception to microkernel performance because of complicated message packing and port rights checking. Yet the Hurd developers are doing well in optimizing it, and to this day Mach is used to malign microkernels by people with no background on the subject. OKL4, in turn, has shipped in ~1.5 <i>billion</i> devices by 2012, powering the baseband processor behind nearly every mobile phone. [3] MINIX 3 further only shows a ~5-10% performance drop relative to monolithic Unixes, this for 2006.

In my experience incremental updates are often exponential in their impact (especially if enough resources are put into a problem). Moore&#x27;s Law is an excellent example of this: at any given time, researchers are working on a fixed number of solutions that will generally make a fixed % impact. This is why we can see a doubling in transistor density without a huge increase in the size of the industry.<p>In the case of reducing accidents, I could see a similar exponential pattern. The first incremental step maybe took the accident rate from 10% to 1% by eliminating 90% of the possible sources of accidents. In the second step, researchers will again shoot to eliminate 90% of the current causes of accidents, bringing the rate to 0.1%. This could repeat every couple years until the accident rate is sufficiently close to 0.",1446313968

One big area where we can improve things is on data collected.<p>Currently, the only data I can usually find on prosecutors is usually their conviction rates. But the job of a prosecutor isn&#x27;t just to convict people, it&#x27;s to convict people <i>who are guilty</i>. Highly visible conviction rates mean that a prosecutor is incentivized to try only easy-to-win cases, even if the defendant in an easy-to-win case is innocent or the defendant in a hard-to-win case is guilty. We need more effort put into overturning convictions generally, and careful collection data on overturned convictions and that data needs to be publicized equally to conviction rates. If 5% of a prosecutor&#x27;s convictions are overturned either through appeal or reversal, that should be a <i>huge</i> red flag.<p>The other thing is, the vast majority of convictions are of poor people who are defended by a public defender. Public defenders are underfunded, understaffed, and as a result, often underqualified (if you&#x27;re a great lawyer, there&#x27;s no reason to become a public defender when you can get paid far more for easier work doing prosecution or private practice). Who knows how much of this false evidence would have been discovered earlier if a competent, well-funded, and well-staffed defense lawyer had investigated the evidence? At the very least, I think prosecution budgets should be tied to defense budgets: there&#x27;s no reason prosecution should ever be funded more than defense. And it might be worth investigating putting public defenders through the same election process as district attorneys (I&#x27;m not sure this would work, but I&#x27;m not sure it has been tried).",1446313372

10483385,comment,10483024,10483024,0,0,raj_o,,,"I am very familiar with arbitration agreements and how they both are enforced and came about. For years companies have tried in vain to get theses clauses accepted by the courts and failed, until recently when SCOTUS chimed in with their decision: Congress wanted the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) of the 1920s to be the law of the land and forced arbitration was considered statutorily okay.. The FAA [ <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Arbitration_Act"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Arbitration_Act</a>, 1925] originally was a maritime law, where two parties in different countries would rather pick an arbiter to decide their dispute rather than in any one country.<p>What may surprise people is it&#x27;s not just the signing of a contract, which enables this clause to be enforced, but also just a business&#x27; intent to settle cases arbitrarily. For instance, opening up a package of something you just bought might show intent that the contract therein is what you agree to. One nurse wasn&#x27;t going to sign her rights away to an arbitration agreement, so she told her company &#x27;no&#x27; to renegotiating her employment contract. But the courts upheld that she knew the intent of her employer and forced her into arbitration.<p>These companies are hiring their own judges, basically. What&#x27;s scary is that these just aren&#x27;t private contracts, and private court systems we are dealing with -- but private law!<p>SCOTUS ruled recently that even if the parties do not like the outcome of the arbitration decision, they have no legal recourse. Imagine going into a situation where a company knows the history of a judges decision and you do not? How incredibly unfair, let alone intimidating. I wouldn&#x27;t even bother to sue, would you?<p>I won&#x27;t go on about this. I can write a lot.

In many cases where causality is obvious, this assignment of blame is fairly straightforward. Example: Bob fell asleep, which caused him to lose control of his car, which hit the bus, which killed a child. Bob is now culpable for the child&#x27;s family suffering. Bob remains one of many others who share culpability at this point, assuming others are also falling asleep at the wheel. FWIW, 103M people fell asleep at the wheel last year in the US, so Bob will likely have company.<p>Now put an autonomous piece of software written by company X into Bob&#x27;s car. Bob engages the autopilot, falls asleep, the autopilot software experiences an error, the software fails to alert Bob, the software loses control of the car, which hits a bus, which kills a child. Who is culpable for the family&#x27;s suffering now? The software? Company X?<p>The only way for company X to both a) allow Bob to fall asleep and b) bear the culpability for a family&#x27;s suffering is to get the software to the point it only makes mistakes in a timeframe that is, at a minimum, several orders of magnitude greater than Bob making the same mistake.<p>The logic goes that, once a company&#x27;s software kills a child, it&#x27;s going to be pretty hard to keep the public from reacting negatively, even though overall suffering will decrease. The only option company X is to require Bob to accept he is &quot;driving&quot; the car and bear the culpability of any suffering the car&#x27;s software may cause, or alternately, be ready to pay a substantial settlement that offsets suffering.",1446312387

I&#x27;m not saying that&#x27;s what people should do. And there are legal limits to how much people can invest and requirements for platforms to educate (and ensure investors understand basic risks like failure rates and need for diversification). When you invest $5k across 50 startups that starts behaving like an index fund.<p>The caveat to the &quot;big win&quot; returns is that it&#x27;s traditionally hard to get access to the companies that have a real chance at IPO. A small group of people with privileged access make an obscene amount of money and it&#x27;s hard to break into that insider club due to structural issues with non-JOBS Act regulations.<p>The health of the asset class, IMO, is dependent on platforms&#x27; ability to attract those companies. For equity crowdfunding (when restricted to rich people) it&#x27;s clearly in the realm of plausibility. The three major platforms all have at least one &quot;Unicorn&quot; under their belt. For unaccredited crowdfunding I&#x27;m optimistic given the information I&#x27;ve seen that this is doable, but if I&#x27;m wrong it&#x27;ll be because the new regulations scare away the &quot;good&quot; companies. Not because retail investors are dumb or there&#x27;s an inherit issue with democratizing access. There will be a law or amendment in the future that fixes any regulatory issue.

My grandfather for example was born in 1900, passed away in &#x27;91, and I was able to learn what it was like growing up on the mean streets of Brooklyn in the early 1900s.  For one thing, boys certainly had gangs, and there certainly was crime.  Fights were not uncommon, and he had to fight plenty since he was on the short side.  But if 2-3 boys were beating on one, others would intervene to break it up; that was considered unfair.  Few carried knives, and no one carried guns. Women were not afraid to go for a walk.  I know a 20-year-old musician who got beaten up walking home from a rehearsal.  A skinny little girl with a violin, and she got her jaw broken by some piece-of-shit mugger.  That would have been almost unheard of in an earlier era.  It truly was a different world.<p>The New York subways were safe at 2 in the morning.  There was little or no road rage.  People were safe in their homes in most places.  Sure, there were spectacular crimes and notorious criminals, but they were notable more for their exceptionalism than anything else.  The average citizen&#x27;s life was rather boring, actually, which is why these edge cases got sensationalized.<p>My mother told me of a news report on the front page of the local paper, that some college students had caroused and caused a disruption on the train the previous night.  <i>This</i> was considered front page news in the old days!<p>In the U.S., prior to desegregation, black families despite the injustice of racism were far more functional than today; in the 1920s, 80% of black families had a mother and father, and the father was generally employed.  Today that ratio is reversed and only 20% are 2-parent homes; furthermore the father is often destitute, drug/alcohol addicted, or in prison.

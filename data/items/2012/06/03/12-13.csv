This is really important.  It does not imply that the average YC company is orders of magnitude less complex than the average pizzeria.  If you have doubts about this one, buy <i>any</i> YC founder drinks and mention ""hiring"" or ""investors"" or ""accounting"", then see how simple their lives are.

What bits are parceled out in this article seem pretty hard to interpret conclusively without more.<p>For example, they mention that children from less-educated families use ""media"" 90 minutes/day more than those from better-educated families, but don't break it down into which kind of media. In addition, ""Kaiser double counts time spent multitasking. If a child spends an hour simultaneously watching TV and surfing the Internet, the researchers counted two hours."" This could potentially have a large effect, but it's not mentioned how large. Are children from less-educated families using media for more total time, or multitasking more, or both? Or perhaps they're even using media for <i>less</i> total time, but multitasking more? Or using it for <i>much</i> more time, but multitasking less? This double-counting metric doesn't make much sense to me in the first place.<p>The causal conclusion about parents being ""unable to monitor"" their kids' usage also seems like only one of many hypotheses. Another one is that kids from less-educated families, which the article notes tend to be poorer, have fewer alternative entertainment options available to them.",1338727896

Run powertop and it will show you what's using power and offer to turn it off</i><p>Oh I perfectly know that, the problem is that it's <i>manual</i>. With OSX I play a song, soundcard comes alive from its powered off state and plays sound, song stops, soundcard powers down after a little idle timeout. The same goes for the webcam, ethernet board and various other components. With Linux I have to either write some suboptimal wrappers to programs to kick devices in or out, or do it manually, or sacrifice battery life.<p>Comparing battery life, Linux is two~three full hours behind OSX out of seven~eight (after thorough analysis involving powertop1/2). That's a 30% drop and brings me to almost a day to a little more than half a day of work per cycle. Well, it was so a year ago, because now my battery has crossed the 600 cycle count bar so it holds an hour less. And don't start telling me ""oh that was a year ago, Linux has improved on that front since then"", since OSX improved in that area too (I've looked at hard data  battery metrics).<p><i>> For your second point, just explicitly command your computer to do what you want. If you want it to go to sleep, type ""acpitool -s"". If you don't want it to go to sleep, don't type that.</i><p>You're missing the point, I perfectly know that too.<p>Find me a single PC that can do this:<p>1) asleep with lid closed, you plug in an external screen and if you're on AC power the computer wakes up and makes the external screen primary, else it does not even wake up and stays asleep.<p>2) awake with lid closed, AC and screen plugged in, you plug out external screen or AC power and the computer goes to sleep<p>3) awake with lid closed, AC and screen plugged in, you open the lid and it becomes primary while external screen becomes secondary.<p>4) awake with lid open, AC doesn't matter but you plug in an external screen and this one becomes secondary, retains its specific configuration including relative position, wallpapers, resolution and color calibration settings from previous times <i>per external screen device</i>.<p>I've written my own extendable acpid handler in Python to achieve various schemes, react to complex events, and take complex actions. I know exactly how to do 2, 3 and 4, and I know exactly how much hackery and time is needed to achieve this, and it's not really reliable in the end. As for 1 it might as well be downright impossible.<p><i>> My X220 has never run out of battery, and I fly a lot and don't really plug my laptop in at home, so 8 hours is apparently enough.</i><p>As I said my battery is getting past middle-aged and the more minutes, the happier. Also you can consider not only ""instant"" battery life (i.e time it takes to go from full to empty) but long-term battery life (time it takes before the battery is a complete brick): the longer the cycles, the less wear it takes, so the longer it lasts before going to the trash.<p><i>> If you like OS X</i><p>I do :-)<p>If only Lion's ""full-screen"" would really be a chrome-less tiling window manager I'd be completely happy. Things, like Window Magnet, fullscreen Terminal.app and tmux help a lot though.",1338725358

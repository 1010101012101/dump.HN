I haven't had one yet whose site was so simple that it avoided issues with IE6. Of course, you might have clients who are less demanding or have more austere tastes, in which case they're really smart because working around IE bugs costs money.<p>The easiest way to answer your question is to point you at this catalog of IE's deficiencies:<p><a href=""http://www.positioniseverything.net/explorer.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.positioniseverything.net/explorer.html</a><p>But if you want a document that really captures the <i>essence</i> of IE-induced terror, you can skim the invaluable ""On Having Layout"":<p><a href=""http://www.satzansatz.de/cssd/onhavinglayout.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.satzansatz.de/cssd/onhavinglayout.html</a><p>Don't read it all at once.

442862,comment,442853,442853,0,0,Tangurena,,,"I'm facing the door (normally open), and not facing the window (which overlooks the Rockies). When I faced the window, I found I didn't look at the monitor, so facing away at least lets me get work done. I have 2 bookcases, one full, the other one getting there. I leave the shades open until about 1pm when I close them because the direct sunlight makes everything unreadable. There are 3 chairs, a whiteboard and another desk (which is unoccupied, and with a hiring freeze is very unlikely to ever get occupied).<p>Because of a bad experience getting laid off at a previous job (if I hadn't tailgated someone else in, I never would have been able to get my personal books and stuff), I normally don't keep more posessions at the office than I can carry out by myself (meaning no aquarium, or other bulky stuffs), and just books.",1232515973

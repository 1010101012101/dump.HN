I guess they could do this as well, if the BTC were tagged and thus <i>refused</i> by the mixers or even worst <i>hold captives</i> and resend them to original issuer. However, you only need 1 TOR hosted mixer to lose track of the wallets.<p>On the other side imagine the practical chaos: I make a <i>huge</i> transaction of non-tangible goods in a situation where you can&#x27;t prove that the service/product was delivered.

7455200,comment,7454437,7455048,1,0,_delirium,,,"That&#x27;s a big point of discussion, yes. And there is some worry that there might be some hamfisted pressure to shove everyone through university as fast as possible and hand out degrees, which would be counterproductive. I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s going to be the main push, but it&#x27;s something to watch out for, given as you say artificial targets.<p>But, I somewhat misspoke: the goal is not to have 50% have specifically bachelor&#x27;s degrees, but 50% complete some form of accredited tertiary education, which includes vocationally oriented degrees (currently a pretty small proportion, but makes the gap to 50% less than it would be if they weren&#x27;t included).<p>The current numbers (for young people, typically age 25-34) are approximately: ~65% of people enter university, and 1/2 of those graduate (~32% of the population). Also, 25% (some the same people) enter tertiary vocational education, and 1/3 of those graduate (~8% of the population). Some people complete both, so the total is a bit less than 32+8, but overall ~38% of young people are attaining some kind of tertiary education.<p>Current trends are that vocational education is roughly flat (in both enrollment and completion rates), but university education is massively increasing (also, in both enrollment and completion rates). It used to be very common to attend university a few years and then do something else, with very low completion rates (only 1/4 of enrolled students eventually graduated as of 1995), perhaps partly because it&#x27;s free to try it out for a year or two. This seems to be becoming less common, with completion rates now on par with the U.S. and Canada (1/2 completing as of 2010).<p>I haven&#x27;t read too much on the current policy, but I believe further increasing university enrollment rates, to maybe closer to 80% rather than 65%, is one part of it. There are also some efforts to improve completion rates of vocational degrees to be closer to the university rates (1/2) rather than the current ones (1/3). Possibly also to get more people into vocational programs, especially people from the category of &quot;young people not currently in work or education&quot;.<p>Data on the current rates and trends from this big PDF: <a href=""http://www.oecd.org/edu/highlights.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.oecd.org/edu/highlights.pdf</a>",1395609550

A lot can be gained just from splitting the API up into multiple services and multiple levels.<p>The HTTP api that&#x27;s accessible over the internet would not be able to connect to the database, instead it would perform its actions by making requests to multiple services, every service having the absolute minimum api endpoints required.

Each of these servers would run on different VM&#x27;s, if the money is there, make that different hardware.<p>Where possible the data would be split into different databases, a trade database, a users database, a wallets database.<p>The different services would have their own login credentials to those databases, would not be able to even connect to databases they don&#x27;t need, and their credentials on those databases would only allow them to execute the queries that they need to do.

Most of the arguments for recording police apply to everyone: Allegations are quickly discovered to be true or false. Everyone involved is less likely to be violent. People are more cordial. Determining guilt or innocence is much easier. Was a shooting self-defense or manslaughter? Did the eyewitness really recognize the defendant on the night of the crime? Etc.<p>There are other perks to life-logging. Conversations could be transcribed and searched, eliminating many disputes as to who said what. We already do this with IRC and some types of video chat. You could even save footage that becomes important only much later. For example, you could prove you sold pencils to Vincent van Gogh before he was famous. Or you could record the first time you met your now-spouse. Finally, there&#x27;s the entertainment value of life-logging.

So what is the simplest and best way to achieve a failover virtual ip assigned to cluster members? I don&#x27;t want the tool to start services, it would be enough if it won&#x27;t send the traffic to failed note by determining with simple logic like if port 80 is not listening? Having a lot of alternatives is good but confusing and having powerful tools is also good but when only simple things needs to be achieved, it requires a lot of time to configure it and it is harder while troubleshooting.

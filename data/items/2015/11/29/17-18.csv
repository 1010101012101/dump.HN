They just need to write the code, and when they do it themselves, the stuff is done much faster and much more efficiently.",1448819941

What you can do is to start widening your current domain of knowledge. You are a programmer: How does your language of choice work internally? How do compilers/interpreters do it for other languages? How does a single core handle your program? What happens with multiple cores? And so on...<p>You&#x27;ll find yourself knowing more and more about SO, architecture, etc and you&#x27;ll be able to take advantage of the knowledge right away (because it&#x27;s related to what you do) and in the future (because many CS domains share common parts).<p>Last, if books work for you, use them.

One, which MacKay touches upon, is multi-junction systems. Another, which he does not (not being an expert in the field) is via so-called multiple-exciton generation systems. Contrary to most engineers&#x27; understanding, this phenomenon is pretty well explained from the point of a low-energy continuum QFT for the materials that most care about for implementation. The real game changer would be to mate these systems with topologically nontrivial materials with surface charge transport protection. Unfortunately with current fabrication capabilities, 70% of the conductivity is in the bulk, which does not possess the topological prohibition to one-particle (or one e-h pair) backscattering. (It would also be interesting to see if the known allowability of 2 particle backscattering applies to excitons in these systems)",1448818978

To give them a leg up in the adult world. To make them smarter and well rounded. We fill our houses with a whole bunch of &quot;enriching&quot; toys.<p>This is extremely misguided.<p>The majority of a child&#x27;s free time should be self directed. They need to experience boredom for proper development. Only in boredom do kids learn to be creative and process their thoughts in a meaningful way. They learn to live with the anxiety boredom creates and channel it into new ideas.<p>Micromanaging their lives leads to very poorly adjusted and anxious adults. I am very sad when I see car trip filled with iPads and TVs. Kids need to learn how to deal with the boredom of car rides and sit quietly with their thoughts.<p>Structured activities are great in moderation.<p>*Adults actually require boredom as well but it is especially valuable for the rapidly developing brains that kids have.",1448817832

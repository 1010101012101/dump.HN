This doesn't seem to be the designer's fault, but they're catching most of the blame.<p>What I don't like about the original article is the ""your opinion is wrong and here's why"" attitude.

5015909,comment,5013321,5015702,1,0,eLobato,,,"-- why vim.<p>Don't want to create a flame thread, but I felt the urge to reply.<p>I was really skeptical of vim as an editor just like you are, until I (and I am so glad I did) forced myself to use vim for a month for ALL my text editing. The linux kernel is old, does that make it less useful? That's not a valid argument at all.<p>It certainly takes some time to learn how to do things, macros, search and replace, move blocks of text, install some good plugins, etc... All of this is incredibly fast and ergonomic as opposed to move your right hand to the arrow keys every now and then. Textmate, Gedit, Redcar, pretty much other text editor has just a subset of features that vim has (emacs being the exception where vim might be a subset of emacs). Learning vim is just like learning a sort of new way of talking to your editor. "":wq"" is obvious once you learn the words. It means write and quit.\nAnother big advantage I see is I can work remotely through SSH and be instantly super productive with an editor that doesn't get in my way. I learnt vim before doing this, now I pretty much do all my coding on remote machines where using Textmate would simply be losing a lot of time after a few days.<p>It is not a replacement for IntelliJ Idea, Eclipse, Visual Studio, or any IDE. IDE's help you in a different way that sometimes can be more valuable than having a powerful tool to edit code. Programming JavaEE apps for instance is something I just find way easier to do with an IDE.<p>I agree, the user has to put a lot of effort to be able to understand and make vim work for him as an amazing editor. Spending time learning how to use a computer program is something we are not used to do these days but in the case of vim it pays off.<p>--- OP<p>Back to the original topic, I agree opening the results on a web browser sort of defeats the point for me as well. If you can find a way to render the articles and comments texts nicely in a terminal I would find it a lot more useful though. Maybe you can reuse the parsing work the fellows at Pulse.me have done, I can't find the feed if there's any though :( . Best of luck!",1357466146

This was an obvious case of the current car companies fearing competition.<p>The current car franchise system sucks (which Tesla is acutely aware of) and with selling something new requires a good team to do it.<p>I have an example first hand when I went to check out the Volt after it first launched.  I kept hearing the advertising saying its 'range' which confused me since I thought the gas generator could power the electric motor after the batteries were exhausted and you could just refill the gas.  I started thinking maybe the gas generator could only extend the range or something (the internet wasn't clear since things were new).<p>When I went to the Chevy dealers they were worse than useless, they knew nothing about the volts they had and what they did tell me ended up being wrong.

And you can manage a program even with tens of millions of lines of code in libraries. And it doesn't make the program itself larger because that library code is <i>reusable</i>, you can also use it in other proofs. Yes, it's incredibly hard to manage such a code base, you also need extensive documentation, something like ""literate programming"" - but it's not intractable.<p>You would have to write a big part of mathematics as library code, probably a multi-decade length project - but the benefits seem <i>huge</i>! ""Translating"" mathematics in such a form could augment a mathematicians brainpower ""manymany....manyfold"" and could be just as important as, let's say, a cancer research project taking decades and tens of millions in funding, but it should worth it! <i>Imagine that hundreds of ""less talented"" mathematicians could handle problems that only a handful of people can understand today (with the guidance of the ""real geniuses"", of course), revolutionizing many fields of science through the consequences of their results.</i><p>As an analogy, when people used roman numerals, only a handful of highly educated people could do complex calculations, but nowadays we all have more than basic arithmetic knowledge, thanks in large part to a ""change of language"". I think a ""change of language"" could really make mathematics a less ""elite only"" field (though I have greater hopes for letting ""AI systems"" give a helping hand than for letting ""lesser mathematicians"" do some of the work, in the end one can't predict what will make the most difference - hardware or wetware, it's still computing power, and, as the complicated software problems are solved, more and more of the computing power can translate into ""mathematical reasoning power"" I think).",1357464961

The BOM generator typically pulls information from the design files (eg. quantities, designators, component type, ...) and also has the ability to bring in information from an external database ( eg. suppliers, last price paid, ...)<p>The main value in a BOM generator is this ability to automatically collect information from the design files and, typically in-house, component databases, due to its integration.  Any standalone web app would risk losing this valuable integration.<p>Note that the component databases are typically in-house, built up over the years, based on knowledge accumulated over many designs.  Some engineers will even carry a personal database from job to job with them.<p>Rather than a BOM generator, I'd say a valuable product would be in a serious on-line database of electronic components.  EDA manufacturers and component manufacturers have half baked efforts, but they all suffer from their being an attempt at customer lock-in rather than being a truly useful resource.<p>It'd be a huge job collating and maintaining such a database, but it could be quite lucrative, especially if it included a facility to link suppliers with customers.  Think imdb, freedb or cddb, but for components instead of movies or songs.  The entry for each component might include:<p>* Manufacturer's data<p>* Schematic symbols<p>* PCB footprints<p>* Parametric information<p>* A list of suppliers<p>* MOQ, lead time, price, ... for each supplier<p>* and so on...<p>You'd also need to be able to generate library data in various formats to suit each EDA/CAD tool, or provide an API through with EDA/CAD tools could issue queries on the fly.<p>It would also be a neat trick to integrate with some of the circuit layout website that are appearing, leaving open the possibility of building an EDA ""design flow"" by exchanging data between using a set of web sites.<p>---\nCAD = Computer Aided Design<p>EDA = Electronic Design Automation",1357464062

""Compiled language"" is an informal term that usually means ""to machine code.""

Presumably, the carpool statute requires another ""person"" in the car, ""person"" being defined elsewhere in the code as a natural person or corporation.  Fortunately, our judicial system gives judges the power to interpret statutes.  Since corporations are legal fictions without a corpus, or physical body,  the judge will likely hold that a corporation cannot satisfy the ""person"" requirement in the carpool statute.  He will interpret the statute to require a natural person, not a corporation.  If this case does go up the chain, look for the legislature to amend the statute in the next session.",1357462908

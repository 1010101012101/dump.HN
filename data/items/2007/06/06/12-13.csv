They are being offered in more places now, but also for a lot more money.  It's $500 for 3 years from comodo.com--that's only a savings of about twenty dollars a year.  I believe multi-year savings used to be much more substantial before.  Yet more reasons to create web applications.",1181134589

All the pictures I pretty much block out because they remind me of advertising.<p>That's why I much prefer news.YC and reddit format to NYT; less annoyances.",1181133511

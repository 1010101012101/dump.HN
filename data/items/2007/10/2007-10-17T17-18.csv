I'm talking about systems which store and manage access to company financial, inventory, human resources, etc. data(1).  Things like SAP, Peoplesoft, Great Plains, and even Quickbooks.  The examples you give are all very nice and innovative I'm sure but they aren't really examples of the same thing.  (Except maybe for ITA but that's very specific to airline industry.)<p>You could have mentioned salesforce.com.  That would be a valid counter to my original argument.<p>(1) <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_software"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_software</a>",1192643662

Start with that.<p>If you are still in China and, damningly, in one of their wretchedly filthy cities. Get out for a while. Go to the country. Go for a run or a walk or get in a sporting fight.

69133,comment,69097,69097,0,0,geebee,,,"My only advice is to make sure you distinguish between short term and long term burnout.  I once left an entertaining startup (that was later aquired by Apple) because I thought I was unhappy with the field, the job, the office, the nature of the work.  I took two months off between jobs, because that was the only way I felt I could get time off.<p>At the end of the two months, I have to say, the old job didn't sound so bad anymore.  I started grad school afterwards, so I was charged up, but I suspect that the time off was what I really needed.  Looking back, it was actually one of the more innovative startups I've ever worked at.<p>You may be looking at deep long term burnout, but how long as it been since you've walked away from work long enough to reset your head?  It doesn't have to be decades - a single year of 10 hour days where you often find yourself at the office on weekends can be enough to cause your mind to rebel and shut down.  Think of your head as an employee that has been pushed too hard, and has retaliated by not producing anything.  <p>I've learned to identify my short-term tendency to burn out and distinguish it from true career malaise.  Maybe I just need more time off than the average person.  I wish I could drive harder, but if I can't, I may as well know that about myself and minimize the damage.   ",1192643542
69132,comment,68705,69107,0,0,davidw,,,"I think we have slightly different concepts of what ""enterprise"" is, actually, which is ok, since it's hardly a term with a precise definition.  I'd tend to think of companies like VMWare as something else, though.  Enterprise to me means SAP, Oracle, IBM, and that kind of thing.<p>Do you think the people who run IBM or GE are stupid?  Probably not...  What they are not, however, is ""hackers"".  That's a vague term too, so I guess debating it is meaningless, but please don't put words in my mouth with regards to ""stupid people"".  There are plenty of smart people whose footsteps I wouldn't wish to tread.<p>As to why PG is focused on web companies, I think it's pretty natural, given his background and what YC does in terms of investment (15K doesn't get you a lot if you're building something capital intensive).  Lots of us are also interested in this idea of startups becoming more widely possible, which also means we're interested, once again, in low capital requirements.<p>So, yeah, there's other stuff out there, but for most of us, the web is where the action is at.",1192643526

Go hang out with family and friends. Don't think about work. Eat well & exercise. Then we will talk.""<p>It was the best advice I ever got.

69128,comment,68705,69044,0,0,edw519,,,"What is your definition of ""enterprise""?  If it's Fortune 500, then I agree with you.<p>If it's the other 7 million small businesses ($1 to $100 million annual revenue, many outside of SOX enforcement), then I disagree.  These people have literally been dying for good software forever.  They are already leapfrogging the enterprise software bandits and installing their own mission critical systems, many based on open source technology.  They simply can't wait for or afford ""enterprise"" solutions.  Their viral chain?  Word of mouth, industry journals, chambers of commerce, tech groups, country clubs, lawyers, accountants,...<p>Just because there is a whole new ""Web 2.0 space"" doesn't mean that those who have been driving the economy for ages have disappeared.

69121,comment,69097,69097,0,0,gibsonf1,,,"What has worked for me in the past is an experience that combines intense physical exertion combined with attaining a difficult goal combined with an inspiring view.  In other words, I hop on my bike and ride up a mountain and refuse to stop until I get to the top and bask in the incredible view.  This has worked wonders for me in helping to gain real perspective on my situation, and I think the physical exertion and intense focus needed to make it to the top of the mountain help ""reboot"" my brain.  Another method, during the winter, is cross-country skiing.  (In the Bay Area, we have the largest X-country ski area in North America 2.5 hours North of SF.)<p>The bottom line, you need to completely focus on something entirely different than your problem at hand to give your subconscious a chance to recuperate and give you a solution and new inspiration.",1192642433

69119,comment,69097,69097,0,0,nostrademons,,,"A little hypothesis:<p>Burnout is your subconscious's way of telling you that you're on the wrong track.<p>I've found that every time I've felt burned out - whether in writing, coding, startup, life - it's because I was working on something that ultimately was going nowhere.  I needed to revisit my assumptions, yet my conscious mind didn't know that.  Burnout was a way for my subconscious to say ""This isn't going to work, you're not working on the important stuff, take a step back and look at the big picture.""<p>When writer's blocked, I delete the last 3 paragraphs I've written and take the story in another direction.  This has almost always cured my writer's block; when it doesn't I delete the last page and take the story in another direction.<p>When coder's blocked, I revert to my last svn commit and start again, usually with a smaller task.  I've thrown away up to a week's worth of work this way, which is another lesson: commit early and often.  Commits should be an hourly or minutely process, not something you do after a whole bunch of work.<p>When blocked in general, I think about the last design decision I made and revisit.  Oftentimes, if I'm blocked entirely and can't even get started on implementing a feature, it's because the feature is ill-conceived and needs to be redone.  Maybe it's done with incorrect assumptions about how users will use the problem, or maybe it just doesn't serve any purpose.  Revisit whether you need the feature at all.  <p>If you find you can't work on your startup at all, maybe it's a sign that your startup is on the wrong track.  Revisit your idea.  I'm actually at that stage with mine: we scrambled to get a demo ready for YC, but now that I want to procrastinate and avoid work (our market is people who want to procrastinate and avoid work), I find that I don't want to use our product.  But I've got some ideas about how to backup and try a different approach, and now I want to try them out and see if they can get me procrastinating with the startup itself.",1192642191

You don't need a high school degree and you don't even need math to drive a taxicab.<p>All this yak about raising the education standard in the USA, when we've got Ph.D.'s in unemployment lines is disheartening. Retraining is the greatest joke. If you're an unemployed IT worker, what is the ""next tier up"" on the ladder to success? Material physics, which requires 5 years study to get online?<p>Economics and economists have some credibility in microeconomics, but outside that limited subject they are herd-oriented and usually wrong, wrong, wrong. Ask Nicholas Taleb what he thinks about the economics profession. Hell, look out the window and remember what economists have told you about the economy over the last 20 years. Were their predictions ever better than a crapshoot?",1246244233

(Suffice it to say I have not often seen Ruby used to run real-time 3D games.)<p>Anyhow, one of the footnotes was that there is this package called Rawr which gives you a Ruby option for packaging a minimal JRuby install with the application and giving it a nice native-esque packaging experience.<p>(Come to think of it, wasn't JotBot the sample application at that presentation?

Although these people may have influence and may pressure the Facebook to act as they want it to, the decision still lays with facebook.""<p>I'm sorry but this simply isn't true.  It's like me holding a gun on you and telling you to do something or I'll shoot.  If I then turned around and claim the choice was still yours I'd be lying.  Same here.  People are threatening Facebook with pain (albeit financial) if they don’t comply.<p>Also remember that, at its core, Government IS society.  What if people voted in representatives that made a law forcing Facebook to squash these groups?  That blows your argument completely out of the water because suddenly the government is acting at the people’s behest to censor<p>Again, this is how good people get on the wrong side of this issue.  They think what they dislike is ok to censor while being against what people they disagree with want to censor.  But once the policy is set that it’s ok to censor that which you don’t like everyone gets into the game and we have a society without free speech.<p>P.S.  On the ""society has always done this"" argument you're right but that doesn't mean society was correct in doing it.  I don't like communists but I also don't approve of Hollywood coming up with a black list and robbing people of their livelihood for their beliefs.  That wasn’t government it was just people and it was wrong.  To go back further Socrates was killed in a sham trial for questioning what he felt was the moral decline of his society.<p>The bottom line is there's no need for censorship.  If a school of thought is reprehensible than you should teach your children that and have your friends teach their children that and if society is really against the reprehensible thought it will be discredited.  Holocaust denial isn't almost universally discredited because people were censored it's universally discredited because we make a point of presenting the facts to our children in history classes around the country.",1246241663

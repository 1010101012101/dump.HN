I would think that fixing bugs would be necessary but not nearly sufficient, and they would have had to re-architect and re-develop major parts of the system. And Microsoft needed to do that while maintaing the backward compatibility that is a major selling point and pushing products out the door quickly enough to generate revenue.<p>It sounds like a nightmare, and not acheivable in 4 years. My impression was that many bugs were fixed but there wasn&#x27;t a major redesign, which always made me doubt how secure Windows could be.",1447869591

VS Code is the first Windows editor that I&#x27;ve used that I don&#x27;t hate.<p>I actually feel quite conflicted. Right now, my favourite dev machine is my Surface 3 non-pro. I use VS Code for local development, and SSH to a tmuxed emacs session on the beefy Linux box at home. My whole life I&#x27;ve generally hated Windows, but since Git for Windows includes bash, it&#x27;s actually not a bad environment.

Having someone code is NOT about seeing what kind of code they produce (well maybe a little); it&#x27;s about getting to know as much as you can about them in as little time as possible.<p>I want to put the candidate under some amount of stress to see how they respond. After all, responding to stress (deadlines, technical issues, people issues, etc.) is a very important part of a programmers job.<p>Just a few of the things I usually learn with a short coding test in an interview right away:<p>- Did he understand the problem?<p>- How did he approach the problem?<p>- Does he appear as if he has any idea what he’s doing?<p>- Can he explain what he has done?<p>- Can he defend what he has done?<p>- Does he understand the concepts of order, cleanness, iteration, branching, recursion, etc., etc., etc...<p>- Based on this small sample, do I think he can do the work we need done?<p>- Do I like him? Will he fit in and be a good team member?<p>Of course, I share all of this with the candidate. There&#x27;s no secret agenda. We just want to make a fair assessment of fit. This is good for everyone.<p>All a take-home project does is separate those who can build superior code from those who can build good code under ideal conditions. This is nice to know, but not a very important metric in the real world.<p>Ideal conditions rarely happen on real projects. Why simulate them in the screening process?",1447869557

It describes exactly how classical reality emerges from the quantum wave function, and hence settles the question of whether or not it is &quot;real&quot;.  The answer is: the question of whether or not the wave function is &quot;real&quot; is based on the false a assumption that &quot;real&quot; is a binary predicate.  It isn&#x27;t.  Whatever the mathematics of the wave function describes does indeed exist, but it exists in a separate ontological category from classical reality.<p>See blog.rongarret.info/2015/02/31-flavors-of-ontology.html for more details.",1447869531

10589439,comment,10583489,10587141,0,0,Jemaclus,,,"I actually do wear a hearing aid, but people tell me that they don&#x27;t notice. I also keep my hair a bit on the long side, so it&#x27;s not usually visible. it&#x27;s also very small.<p>I haven&#x27;t really run into anyone who immediately ended a date, but I suspect that I&#x27;ve been declined for dates because of it. I have also gone on strings of dates with women where they eventually either just fizzled out and stopped accepting new dates, or they pulled the &quot;let&#x27;s just be friends&quot; card. I would be foolish to attribute this all to my hearing loss (I can certainly be a difficult person at times), but part of me always wonders.<p>To answer your second question, I think there is still a small stigma attached to it. Glasses are ubiquitous in today&#x27;s society. Hearing aids, not so much. That said, the bluetooth revolution in the last five years has gone a long, long, long way toward making it more acceptable (or at least normal) to see something sticking out of someone&#x27;s ear. Little kids will sometimes come up and ask me what&#x27;s in my ear, but adults never do.<p>That said, my hearing aid is amazing. It has Bluetooth capabilities. I can listen to music without having to wear headphones. I can stream a phone call directly to my hearing aid, without the awkwardness of trying to hold a phone speaker up to my hearing aid microphone. It has volume control, &quot;restaurant mode&quot; for loud situations, and even &quot;music mode&quot; that doesn&#x27;t filter out background noise at all. It&#x27;s pretty fantastic, and I think over time, it will only get better.<p>The biggest hassle I have right now with hearing aids is battery life. I&#x27;ve developed a sixth sense about it, where I&#x27;ll just randomly think, &quot;Huh. When&#x27;s the last time I changed the battery?&quot; and then an hour or two later it will die. Still, sometimes I&#x27;m caught unaware. One time I was at a job interview, and it died on me. I had to excuse myself and go get a fresh pack of batteries from a Walgreens across the street. They still passed me on to the next round of interviews. (I didn&#x27;t get the job, though).<p>If I had a few million dollars to do a hardware startup, I would try and develop a hearing aid that runs off body heat or some other mechanism. The main reason hearing aids are so big is because the case has to hold the battery -- the battery is by far the biggest component. If we could get rid of it, it could just be a band-aid like strip on the back of the ear and practically invisible.<p>Sorry, I digress. Going back to your earlier questions, I should be clear that the visibility of the hearing aid is probably not a problem. The actual hearing loss is probably the biggest turn off. Hearing aids aren&#x27;t like glasses, where you can technically get back to 20/20 vision with minor help. You never really get back to 100% hearing with a hearing aid. There&#x27;s always something off. And even my friends sometimes get tired of me saying &quot;What?&quot; all the time.<p>I hope that was helpful. Feel free to email me if you have any further questions. I&#x27;m happy to answer. I believe my email is in my profile.",1447869362

It is implied (though not stated) in the report that in the absence of appropriate data, the operations navigation team attempted to contain/mitigate the deviations instead of &#x27;solving&#x27; it.<p>The report also notes substantial organizational issues. Different navigation teams were used in development and operations, and there were insufficient knowledge transfer during hand-off that hampered the operations navigation team ability to notice these issues. Communications between the main operations team and the ops nav team were not effective. They were apparently spatially separate teams. In addition, model-measurement conflicts which were brought up were solved via e-mail instead of over formal processes. The report suggests that systemic use of formal processes may have allowed teams to uncover the problem earlier in time.<p>And of course, the report also states that insufficient verification/validation of the supplied software was not completed.

Whether the result is a good\n    thing or a bad thing depends on how it is used, but the power is a value.\n\n    Once in Hawaii I was taken to see a Buddhist temple. In the temple a\n    man said, “I am going to tell you something that you will never forget.”\n    And then he said, “To every man is given the key to the gates of heaven.\n    The same key opens the gates of hell.”\n\n    And so it is with science. In a way it is a key to the gates of heaven,\n    and the same key opens the gates of hell, and we do not have any\n    instructions as to which is which gate. Shall we throw away the key\n    and never have a way to enter the gates of heaven? Or shall we struggle\n    with the problem of which is the best way to use the key? That is,\n    of course, a very serious question, but I think that we cannot deny\n    the value of the key to the gates of heaven.”\n</code></pre>\nEncryption is just a tool, and like every tool that has ever been made it will occasionally be used jby bad people doing bad things.<p>We keep learning more and more science and technology, and I don&#x27;t think it is truly possible to stop that trend. I suggest we start finding ways to live with each other in the presence of technologies like encryption, because he problem is only going to get worse. We, as a species, are going to have a serious problem if we haven&#x27;t learned that lesson by the time someone invents a way to make nuclear weapons with common household parts... or some unknown technology that is even worse.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Compendious_Book_on_Calculation_by_Completion_and_Balancing"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Compendious_Book_on_Calcul...</a>",1447868876

Why is it that the default settings applied by (most) browsers are so awful?<p>The answer to the first is pretty much, as another HNer noted, the topic of the Better Motherfucking Website page. The defaults suck.<p><i>Why</i> the defaults suck is ... probably an accident of history that&#x27;s difficult to undo. Browsers default to no margins and a whole slew of other stuff, and <i>CSS requires that you either start from known defaults or explicitly style each and every element.</i><p>If every browser used its own distinct set of deviations-from-default for various entities, CSS would be <i>even more</i> of a hack than it already is.<p>Some of the fault also surely lies with standards organisations, including the W3C.

If you look on the surface, Rockefeller&#x27;s business practices look positively abhorrent. In an event called the Cleveland Massacre, he threatened to bury rival refiners unless they sold their business to him.<p>But look underneath, and the picture changes dramatically. The prices he offered for his rivals were so good that many of them started new refineries just so they could sell to Rockefeller. If they took Standard Oil stock, they became fabulously wealthy. Rockefeller was eminently fair in his business dealings. Those who claimed otherwise were doing so out of malice or ignorance.<p>I bet if you looked under the surface at Uber, you&#x27;d see a different picture than the one you see now. When I look at Uber, I see a company bravely fighting a political battle that absolutely has to be fought.<p>Rockefeller hired some really nasty guys that didn&#x27;t have the same ethical practices he did, they caused him no end of trouble, but in the end, he needed all the competent oilmen he could get his hands on to run Standard Oil. His executives got as far in the business as their ethics would allow.<p>Uber needs all the resources it can muster to change the way the country thinks about transportation and business. The people at the top can&#x27;t afford to sweat the details of everything their employees are doing.<p>I don&#x27;t know exactly which Uber business practices you&#x27;re referring to as unethical, but I bet if you critically analyzed them, you&#x27;d find that they&#x27;re either small and localized, (shenanigans in local markets against Lyft) or actually fair when you take a closer look.

Consider the measurements of a pair of space-like separated entangled photons.  A <i>choice</i> can be made about the details of these measurements by the experimenters at the last second possible.  For example, the rotation angle of a polarizer can be randomly chosen the instant before a photon strikes it, yet correlations with this choice show up in the <i>other</i> measurement that was taken far away.

All it means is understanding that we&#x27;re fighting a religious enemy bent on religiously motivated ends.<p>In fact, fighting this enemy requires the vocal support of peaceful Muslims whose countries are being taken over by these theocrats, those whose livelihoods in Beirut and Baghdad and Karachi and Jakarta are much more at threat than livelihoods in Paris and Madrid and New York City.<p>That said, I don&#x27;t have a solution; I don&#x27;t think anyone does. You can&#x27;t fight a religion, only people, and you can&#x27;t blame all followers of a religion for the actions of a subset of that religion (or, as some would have you believe, a non-subset of that religion). All you can do is name your enemy, and when they declare war on you (which they have--they&#x27;ve declared war on civilization, modernity, Muslims and non-Muslims alike), declare war back.",1447867080

We got a pet hedgehog, who was adorable and entertaining, and I thought it would be fun to make a blog to share with family, friends, and hedgehog fans online. While you probably can&#x27;t tell so well from that blog post, I&#x27;m a decent photographer, so I took a lot of absurdist photos of the hedgehog doing various things in little sets, and was amused by taking a set of photos and figuring out how to weave some kind of absurd shaggy-dog story out of it. It&#x27;s not monetized in any way (other than costing a tiny bit for the domain), and is purely for the entertainment of me and whoever winds up reading it, so it&#x27;s much more fun.<p>Until relatively recently I worked at Apple so I know the feeling of needing to compartmentalize work into a private space. The last project I worked on there was way too much pressure and really not fun for me (replacing an internal software system with heritage from the NeXT days that I&#x27;d worked for years with a system that was technically inferior but more &quot;Enterprise&quot;), so writing silly stories helped as a steam valve.

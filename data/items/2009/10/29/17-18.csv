910471,comment,909990,910330,0,0,jrockway,,,"No cryptography was broken.  Given a number, he found a number that divided it.  It's a property of the universe, and you can't copyright properties of the universe.  (That gravity is <i>mine</i>!!!)<p><i>I think that breaking cryptography should not be, as long as you inform the owner a six months before going public, and do not use the result for any personal gain.</i><p>It worries me that anyone would say something like this.  I notice that 2 * 2 is 4, and I have to wait 6 months before telling anyone?  Or what?  What would TI do with this information?  Why does TI have a right to tell me what I can do with chunks of plastic with TI's logo on it?  (Remember, he's not copying their software; he wants to delete their software and use his own.)  What legal framework would this fit into?  Factoring numbers has nothing to do with copyright law, and a new law suppressing the publication of scientific research is a clear violation of the Constitution.  Even if it is illegal, people can't be stopped; you can't police the entire Internet, and you can't stop people from installing software on their calculator.  There is no way a government or corporation could monitor this.<p>So you basically want to make a law that is a violation of hundereds of years of American principles, that is completely impossible to enforce, and that will drastically slow down scientific and mathematical progress.  All so a piece of plastic that says ""TI"" on it can only run TI's buggy code?<p>Wow.  I ... just don't know what to say.<p>You also use the word ""owner"".  Who owns a number?  Does TI own the number because they used it to sign some software?  Can I ""own"" the number 4 because I say I do?  If you are in a situation where you have four pieces of candy, and want to split them between you and your friend, should you have to inform me of your intentions and wait 6 months before giving yourself two pieces of candy and your friend the other two pieces?  Why not?  I'm the owner of the number 4, and anything you do with it needs my approval.<p>The thing about ""personal gain"" is also insane.  Everyone uses facts for personal gain.  Big investment banks analyze market trends to make themselves billions of dollars.  TI assumes you can't factor a number, and they use that to prevent you from cheating on math tests.  All ""personal gain"" of the same variety.  Should all enterprise be made illegal?<p>Now that I think about it, I guess your post is sarcasm... but you had me worried there for a minute.",1256838967

910457,comment,910203,910368,0,0,NateLawson,,,"H(m || k) was a construction that was used in the early 1990's. No protocol standards specified it after HMAC appeared in 1996. SHA256 appeared in 2002.<p>If you're using a 2002 heavyweight hash function with an early 1990's MAC construction, you are an idiot. I can use such strong words because <i>no one does this</i>. There are no standards anywhere that specified this exact construction because HMAC was invented long before SHA2. If anyone does this in some private toolkit, it's the perfect example why unreviewed, proprietary crypto designs are horrible.<p>However, the much more likely scenario if you use H(m || k) is that you're using MD5 (or possibly, but less likely, SHA-1). You have a legacy application that inherited an early 1990's design. This construction was specified for SNMP in 1991, for example.<p>So while you have a technical point, your argument is detrimental to real, deployed systems. I'm extremely concerned that your straw man argument based on SHA256-SecretSuffix, which is extremely unlikely to exist anywhere, would be taken as supporting MD5- or SHA1-SecretSuffix which <i>I know exist</i> in various toolkits.

Heâ€™s at a point where the company is still growing and has a decision to face -- sell it or expand it in a way that moves him into a CEO position with a staff reporting to him.  Right now he has a just 3 or so employees, all working from home.  He doesnâ€™t like the idea of setting up an office -- he really is a startup guy and wants to move on to another project.  So now heâ€™s thinking of selling, and knows little about how to approach that.<p>So the main question is: How does one sell a startup?<p>I know a thing or two now about approaching angels and VCs, but little about approaching buyers.  Do VCs buy companies or know people who do?  Does one just directly contact competitors like Iâ€™ve heard?  Any tips on how to go about this are appreciated.  The guy who founded this site bootstrapped it and has no ""connections"" to speak of.  Itâ€™s a great feat and an inspiration to those going it alone. However, it really does leave him in the dark now that he wants an exit and I'm pretty sure this company is too big to use digitalpoint, eBay, etc. for a sale.<p>Another question: How does one value a company?<p>I know enough to know that this is an art as much as a science, especially with startups.  Iâ€™ve heard three to five times gross revenue, especially if the business is growing.  That gives a target range of 9 to 15 million.<p>I guess I hear about companies going up for sale and donâ€™t really know if there is a process that they use to announce it or if they just put out a press release or what.<p>Notes: Iâ€™ve searched YC and found a few posts in a similar vein.  Forgive me if there is overlap, but I didnâ€™t get all the answers I felt I needed for this particular situation (such as using digitalpoint or eBay for sales).

If you and the bank share ""secret-key"", and nobody else can guess it, then only you and the bank can compute the function. So when you send the message ""name=bob,withdraw=$200"", you tack the result of the function to the end, and the bank can prove the message came from you.<p>The first two functions are what a normal, reasonable developer could be expected to come up with given SHA1 as a tool. Combine the key with the message and hash them; you can't work back from the hash to the message, so the hash doesn't reveal the key, and the hash will be wildly different if even a single bit of the key is different.<p>The first example is totally, fatally broken. SHA1 (and MD5 and many other hashes) are machines that share a common design called Merkle-Damgaard, which means that they process messages in block-length chunks, and use those blocks to permute an internal state. The output SHA1 is the ""final"" contents of that state. But there's nothing that actually ""finalizes"" the SHA1 state; if you see the SHA1 value on the wire, you can keep cranking the Merkle-Damgaard machine with additional data. That means you can mint new messages with arbitrary data tacked to the end that will appear to be authentic. This attack is incredibly easy to carry out; it takes ~20 lines of Ruby code.<p>The second example is also broken, and it's the subject of this blog post. If you tack the key on after the message, you can't keep driving the hash with data, because a secret you can't guess goes on the end of it. Colin and Nate are arguing about that downthread.<p>The final example is HMAC. People talk a lot about HMAC without really knowing what it is, but there you have it. What makes HMAC so much more secure than the other two ""normal programmer"" examples is that the key and the message are being hashed in separate steps, each made mathematically distinct from each other with the opad (0x5c) and ipad (0x36).<p>Now you know, and knowing is 1/10000th of the battle.",1256835798

I have a television which can only output video (what do you mean, it can't <i>record</i> what its displaying?!), etc.<p>All these devices - that can ultimately only do one thing - serve me just fine. That isn't to say that every single-purpose device will have a widespread market; the ebook reader market is very much a niche - and so is this market, Twitter anywhere without a cell phone contract.<p>And there's nothing wrong with serving a niche.",1256835682

The stock price is an arbitrary number derived by people who do nothing but sit around deriving stock prices.<p>Both TomTom and Garmin (hell they make avionics suites FFS)_ address different market needs from google, and I highly doubt either will see a dramatic immediate effect on their revenues. Long term, my guess is that TomTom will feel something, but Garmin is pretty secure on the high end.",1256835620

A little like regular expressions with control over backtracking, side effects during pattern matching, and many other features. SNOBOL provided a very unique paradigm in its day, and I can attest that ""Thinking in SNOBOL"" required letting go of almost everything FORTRAN taught you about programming :-)<p>The first implementation actually compiled SNOBOL programs into FORTRAN programs.

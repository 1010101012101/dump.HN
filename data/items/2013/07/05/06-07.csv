5993699,comment,5991132,5992767,1,0,rz2k,,,"I have a difficult time accepting that as a narrative for what happened to prevent SOPA from becoming law, and am not sure what the implications are for the constellation of topics surrounding privacy and secretive agencies compelling cooperation.<p>To start of with, (1) I don&#x27;t think that Google et al were intimidated by users&#x27; potential wrath in the face of SOPA passing, and (2) do not think that lobbyists countering those in favor of the legislation had any notable effect.<p>To the first part, few people said they were threatening to boycott Google or Facebook, and their threats would not have been credible. Additionally, the list of companies who eventually came out against SOPA do not spend very much on lobbying.<p>SOPA might have been a help to incumbent market participants, because while it would have been feasible for them to implement protections, it would have been an enormous barrier to entry for any new competitors based on user-generated content. So, I agree that it is surprising that they eventually came out against SOPA, and that it may have been for the sake of public relations as much as for sincere ideological compatibility.<p>And yet, still, many of the most powerful lobbies have influence through the large number of members who follow through when the group decides to send letters expressing outrage about some pet issue as much as from financial power, which is ultimately used for financing ads in attempt to influence people&#x27;s votes.<p>Anyway, I&#x27;d encourage people to watch one of the talks Aaron Swartz gave on the subject,[1] where he specifically talks about the unprecedented number of calls into Congress and how surprised people on the Hill were about seomthing that seemed to come out of nowhere.<p>There is no argument that those in favor of SOPA blamed the overwhelming popular reaction on Google and others somehow bamboozling people, but they aren&#x27;t arguing that it wasn&#x27;t the popular reaction that mattered. Of course, they also can&#x27;t explain why Google cared more about SOPA than people who would eventually be the source of that user-generated content that SOPA would block.<p>Anyway, that&#x27;s a long way at getting to what may really matter when it comes to privacy and the ability of people to communicate with eachother off-the-record. So far the equation most politicians must see is that they will be blamed whenever a future attack occurs if they stood up against something advocated by people deep in national security.<p>It would be interesting to see a poll of people who came out against SOPA, since I think it was a pretty nuanced issue. Unfortunately, the value of privacy seems like a pretty nuanced issue as well. In one sense, it doesn&#x27;t limit you to be patted down in the airport, but it does to have all of your conversations recorded and on record. And yet, the former is the one most likely to upset many people.<p>While I thought SOPA would prevent innovation on the internet, I think that the repository of communication will become increasingly dangerous as computing power progresses and data analysis methods improve. Since all progress, whether it is sociological or technological necessarily involves change, there will be established powers that have an interest in being able to use that repository to impede progress.<p>Anyway, I think it is counter productive to achieving public policy aims to treat the hurdles as insurmountable and ignore the successes of popular constituencies of all types. There would be no history because nothing would ever change if everything were the results of infallible puppetmasters.<p>On a more philosophical level, I suppose the argument to be made is that there will be a lot of change in the future, and that while some disasters will definitely occur, past trends certainly suggest that that things generally improve over time. In other words, even if the shutdown of free, unfettered, unrecorded communication prevented some disasters, it would come at the expense of limiting progress as well once better and better analytics make it a better tool for sabotaging change.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fgh2dFngFsg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fgh2dFngFsg</a>",1373006986

One of those things that seems to make sense in theory, and maybe makes for a good political screed every now and then.<p>If low prices drove the competitors out, then high prices will surely see them flood back in.<p>Any firm that gains monopoly power and hikes the prices without inviting fresh competition probably worked out some sweetheart deal with the government--and even then, they&#x27;re better off keeping margins fairly low, since a govt-approved monopoly is easier to justify when the firm is not obscenely profitable.<p>Ultimately I don&#x27;t think a business born out of deep discounts is suited well to massive price hikes. It destroys the identity they&#x27;ve built with consumers and if they weren&#x27;t in the game to be deep discounters over the long haul, then I&#x27;d say they&#x27;ll die.

You will then be a salaryman, owned body and soul by your company, and worked in conditions which resemble indentured servitude for roughly your first 20 to 25 years.  In return, you will be promoted in lockstep with the rest of your entering class, you will never be fired, and you will be awarded social status and security with the guarantee of neither of them ever being imperiled by virtually anything.",1373005833

I&#x27;m not an expert on crypto, but I know enough to know I wouldn&#x27;t ever dream of rolling my own. Your best bet is to get one of the well established (and well regarded) crypto libraries, pick a suitably large key length (if in doubt, go larger), and follow the documentation exactly.<p>Even using a good crypto library won&#x27;t save you if you don&#x27;t follow the docs or try to get creative with the API. For instance, using multiple passes of different encryption algorithms won&#x27;t necessarily improve the strength of the encryption. Due to subtle mathematical interactions it can often lead to exploits that wouldn&#x27;t have existed in the individual algorithms, but do exist in the combined algorithm. Similarly doing encryption quickly might seem like an important goal, but often consistency is more important lest you inadvertently create a potential timing attack.<p>TL;DR; Use a good crypto library, a large key size, a good source of entropy, and follow the documentation exactly, don&#x27;t try to get creative with it.",1373005250

Your absolute statement is false when looking at most of the valued literature over the last few hundred years.<p><i>The more verbose code is, the more prone to error and less maintainable it is.</i><p>I think this is true, but <i>only to a certain point</i>. Past that point the code becomes more difficult to understand and less difficult to maintain (for example all variables with one-letter names, few new lines). So there&#x27;s a continuum there between terse impenetrable languages, and verbose impenetrable languages on either extreme, and you disagree with the OP about where on that continuum Go falls. It&#x27;s all a matter of opinion and frankly is more subjective than objective and depends on things like the standard library and culture of the language far more than the syntax.<p>There are also many other factors in being maintainable and error prone - verbosity is only one of them. So saying that Go is more verbose than language X doesn&#x27;t really tell us much about how prone to error or maintainable Go is compared to language X on its own. For what it&#x27;s worth, I find it comparable to languages like C, Ruby or Python in terms of verbosity, which feels about the right place to stop being terse to me. YMMV.",1373005231

A company can grant restricted stock subject to vesting to non-employees.<p>This is still a bad idea for a number of reasons. The most notable: the author clearly lacks all understanding of the implications of what he&#x27;s asking for.<p>1. The author&#x27;s client would need to prepare the legal documents for his equity compensation package, which could easily cost several thousand dollars. Depending on the structure of the compensation, the company might have to bear additional costs. For example, a 409A valuation can easily exceed $20,000. Please note that 409A can apply to a variety of deferred compensation structures, so your suggestion that the author seek deferred compensation is not necessarily a good one.<p>2. If the author wants stock options, he would only be eligible to receive non-qualified stock options. These lack the advantageous tax treatment of ISOs.<p>3. If the author receives stock outright with no vesting, the full value of the stock would produce immediate taxable income.<p>4. If stock the author receives is subject to vesting, he&#x27;s going to want to look at an 83(b) election if he doesn&#x27;t want to find himself in a world of hurt.<p>5. All of this is complicated by the fact that the author is a foreigner. The UK has a tax treaty with the United States, but he&#x27;ll want/need the counsel of a competent accounting and legal professional in both countries. Additionally, in some scenarios, the author may not even be able to work with a US company. For example, he could not be a shareholder in an S-corporation, as foreign ownership of an S-corporation is forbidden.<p>If the author knew the burdens he was placing on his prospective clients, and more importantly himself, it&#x27;s unlikely he would ever offer his services in this fashion. So as valuable as his skills and experience might be, I would argue he&#x27;s doing himself a disservice by trying to sell his skills and experience in this fashion.",1373004553

What do you think the computers that store and index those things are doing, without a warrant?<p>You&#x27;re pretty conveniently leaving out several important words, and also ignoring the &quot;, and&quot; between the first and second clauses of the amendment.<p>1) You left out the word &quot;unreasonable&quot; from &quot;search.&quot; The 4th amendment doesn&#x27;t protect against &quot;search of those effects&quot; it protects against &quot;unreasonable&quot; searches thereof.<p>2) You left out the word &quot;their&quot;. The 4th amendment doesn&#x27;t protect against searches of effects. It protects against searches of <i>your</i> effects. You might reasonably say that a Word document on your hard drive is <i>your</i> effect. It&#x27;s a little harder to say that a Word document on Google&#x27;s hard drives is nonetheless <i>your</i> effect. I think it strains the definition of the word &quot;your&quot; to say that Google&#x27;s records about what you search for, or AT&T&#x27;s records about who you call are <i>your</i> effects, rather than AT&T&#x27;s effects, when you didn&#x27;t generate those records and indeed when those records were never even in your possession.<p>3) Searches don&#x27;t necessarily require probable cause. The &quot;, and&quot; separates the two parts of the sentence. Searches must be reasonable, <i>and also</i> for any search that requires a warrant, the warrant must be supported by probable cause.",1373004250

Updating before or on the weekend can lead to your releases spiraling out of control with no staff monitoring or just a skeleton crew.<p>It is better to have your whole team available and awake. I also worry that you might forment resentment by making everyone work every release weekend. Releases will likely become more infrequent, and lead to bigger changes and bigger failures.<p>Please consider that Balsamiq did recover. May be harder to do so on Saturday.",1333461565

3792902,comment,3792403,3792810,11,0,tomp,,,"Null: Null is not evil, but programmers often fail to take it into account. If you see type `string`, it might not be immediately obvious that you can get <i>either</i> a `string` object, <i>or</i> `null`. It could be useful (for preventing bugs and for speed) to have different annotations for nullable and non-nullable variables/parameters (e.g. `string?`, or `string | null`, or `union(string, null)`).<p>Global GC: It's hard to do GC without stopping the world. If different threads have different heaps, only a single thread needs to be stopped at any given time for the GC to be performed (on this thread's heap). AFAIK, Rust also supports manually managed references.<p>Shared mutable state: I believe that is more of a language restriction, not VM (i.e. sending messages could be implemented without copying). Simplifies debugging and makes some abstractions much easier (distributed computing in particular).",1333461460

I can internalize the sorting algorithm easily.

On the ""operational"" side, having modules that produce dynamic libraries with good versioning semantics helps.<p>- ""that preserve large-system integrity, availability"" - again, type safety, in-built null pointer protection and garbage collection all help make sure that code doesn't fall over as much as it could without those (there are some philosophical arguments in here that I'm not exploring).<p>- ""concurrency"" - Consensus appears to be forming around the idea that a good way to manage concurrency is with lightweight processes and message passing rather than threads and shared state.

Say what you want about ASN.1 and similar formats, but if you have a correct parser, you know the values are exactly the ones you expect.<p>Real-life example I kept running into was SIP implementation. (think someone knew only HTTP and decided to create internet telephony) First, you have line length when parsing - some implementations will limit it, some won't. If it's limited, some implementations will allow you to wrap the lines according to the protocol. But then others will say it's too complicated and unlimited line-length is the way to go. Then you have alternative names for sip uris: you can say ""me"" <number@ip>. Or just <number@ip>. Or number@ip. Or <number@ip>;some_parameter. Or someone else decides to go with <number@ip;some_parameter>. Some parameters have associated values, some don't - guess how many implementations don't support both ways...<p>Before you know it, there's 1000 conventions and everyone supports some minimal common core, but fails for at least one other specific implementation.<p>So you say - there's always structured text - json/xml/... But look at the example in the blog post:<p><pre><code>    <dict>
      <key>Bounds</key>
      <string>{{25.4278, 76.3008}, {104.75, 91.8751}}</string>
</code></pre>
So how long until someone comes up with implementation that doesn't use spaces between the numbers? What's the supported precision? What happens when one tuple is skipped? Do you have to parse exponential numbers correctly? How do you deal with duplicate keys in the dict?<p>I see the appeal in text formats and then remember... no - it's not the right way. JSON is a bit less-wrong than XML here, because you know what's a number, what's a string, what's a list. You'd probably do {'Bounds': [[25.4278, 76.3008], [104.75, 91.8751]]}.<p>Until someone comes out with a popular implementation that does case-insensitive matching for keys... and switches from 'Bounds' to 'bounds' in some version.",1333459612

3792781,comment,3792486,3792486,21,0,michaelochurch,,,"For at least 100,000 years, we've lived in a desperately poor world in which (to rip off Our Lady Peace) ""every calorie's a war"". We still live in one, if you take a global perspective, but we're moving out of such a state.<p>What do I mean by ""desperately poor""? (I'm making a tall assertion since there's no economic comparison, at least none that we know of, to human history.) I mean that we're biologically programmed to rapidly exceed any carrying capacity. Economic growth throughout most of human history has been so slow as to be absorbed entirely in population growth, which has been great for priests and kings but terrible for subjects. Per-capita well-being almost hadn't changed (on a global scale; there were local ups and downs) between 10,000 BC and about 1840 AD. Technological advances were absorbed entirely into the task of supporting larger populations.<p>In a desperately poor world, you need to force everyone to work. People who aren't working are ""lazy"" and need to be punished. What most dictators actually want is to mechanize work: to replace these complex, difficult organisms (that sometimes break down and stop working) with mechanical ones without family ties, without belief in gods except the ones favorable to ""the state"", and without creativity or self-awareness or any desire for autonomy. That applies to ancient, semi-fictional dictators like Gilgamesh and it applies to modern, faceless dictatorships like 20th-century authoritarian communism. We're finally finding our way to the compromise, which is to use technology to create those mechanical workers (robots)-- because humans despise being treated as machines, and we're also really bad at the work they do well. Early computers were actually slower than human ""computers"", but had a lot more in the way of endurance.<p>Now we're moving toward a rich world and we're totally unprepared for it. We have millennia-old assumptions about peoples' relationships with work (that there will always be useful work for people to do, making it fair and reasonable to structure a society where everyone who can work must) that are about to become invalid, and none of our social structures are prepared for this change even on a national scale, much less a world one.<p>I'm starting to think we should just give stuff away. Instead of the IMF and World Bank putting these African countries into debt, let's just tax rich people a little more and pay people to build safe water systems. For free. There's plenty of infrastructural and environmental that the world needs, and if there aren't market incentives for people to do the right thing, then that's a perfect place for government to get involved: tax the rich, and pay underemployed Americans to do things that are good for the country and for the world.<p>For the record, world poverty is a complex problem and most of what we call ""aid"" isn't what we need to heal the world. Giving money to poor countries just makes their elites richer. We should be giving away water, medicine, technological access, and (most importantly) education.",1333459567

I didn't really use it that much and I had no concept of computer programming was. By the age of 11, I discovered something at my local library, reading a book called ""The Beginner's Computer Handbook - Understanding & Programming The Micro"". My eyes lit up because of the fact that anyone can create a space shooter game. I was noob back then. I didn't know what a compiler/interpreter was so I thought by typing BASIC source code into notepad, rename the txt file as exe, hoping it would run. Until I found out about Qbasic(My first programming tool) was on every copy of Win95 CD.<p>During my middle school years, I got more interested in computers, reading fat books about programming during english class. I made a couple of prank virus programs that I installed on other people's computers. I made a friend who was also like me but he wasn't much of a programmer. I got into computer hacking afterwards when he showed me that it was possible to disable desktop restrictions on the Library's computers, free to download at T1 speeds. So I wrote a program in Qbasic to automate the exploit. I eventually de-friended him as he wasn't a good influence.<p>There were two other people of influence, both had their own personal websites. That got me started on webdesign, and Java applets programming.(My first java app was an online chat server).<p>Later on I got into game programming starting with Darkbasic, BlitzBasic and now Unity.<p>Now at 25, I work as a Linux Sys Admin and SaaS Backend integration. My other hobby is building electronics using PIC chips.<p>Kids today can have a RaspberryPi to tinker with, I happy that schools are providing them the opportunity to get interested in programming, because in my time, I didn't have that and computer classes only thought how to use Excel and typing skills.",1333459495

By shoring up what you already know, you can become the Michael Jordan of database engineers and command a premium.<p>The strengths are fairly obvious, in that you are building from a knowledge set you already have, and it might be easier to acquire more of that knowledge in a shorter time.<p>The cons are that you are at the vulnerability of the strength of the platform.  If you were, for example, the best COBOL programmer in the world, the market opportunities are probably pretty slim at the moment (just guessing), but due to that rarity, you might be able to command more until the platform becomes completely extinct.<p>If you'd prefer to mitigate those cons, or if you prefer being the jack of all trades, then you may be inclined to work on your weaknesses, and start shoring up areas of knowledge somewhat tangential to your core.  If you are currently a database engineer, this might mean learning a scripting language to automate tasks, or picking up on enterprise storage technologies to better understand the underlying platforms, etc.<p>Strengths to this are that you become more well-rounded, but at the expense of being the more thorough specialist.<p>Jobs may be easier to come by, but may not pay as well due to lack of specialty.  In small companies, or more flexible roles, you may have the opportunity to shine more as you can touch on areas outside of your pigeonhole.<p>Anyway, just my thoughts, and all speak more to a core discipline than broadening skills into marketing, sales, etc., but probably apply to varying degrees.",1333459086

So they're trying to boost numbers in the short term, because in the long run they won't be in power anyway.<p>The funniest thing is that it's not even working: we're now officially back into recession, and as much as I love startupping, I don't think we can go from here to Silicon-Valley status in 6 months -- because that's the sort of scale the UK economy needs <i>right now</i> to compensate for the rest of the economy tanking.",1333458210

It doesn't work in all cases, but one of the major reasons that people don't want binary is because of proprietary formats. If the binary format is open, it can be easy to write open-source/well-polished tools for debugging/viewing them. Maybe not as simple and ubiquitous as netcat or telnet, but it works.<p>The biggest downside is lack of <i>easy</i> transparency which can results from a format/protocol being proprietary, or just obscure to the point that no one remembers the details and the documentation is lost.",1333458205

  foo.bar = function(fn, str) {

In order to handle customers requests for this or that custom UI feature, I invented a tool that generates something like a simplified XIB file from an image and a chunk of CSV.  I made the end result of the tool a text file that the iPhone code parses.<p>Working in text saved a lot of time.  Since I invented my own tool, naturally there were things to debug and tweak in the results, but I could do that with a text editor and commit the changes as easily diff-able deltas in git.  Although I work on iPhone code, everything also has to be implemented in Android - but it's no problem for the Android developer to use the text file since it's just text.<p>I've also written tools for migrating chunks of customer data from an old back-end system to a new one using the new server's customer-facing API.  This was partly for dogfooding purposes, since the API was new and had very suspect stability.<p>I wrote the tools to generate text files where each line is a JSON payload that would be sent to the server.  It made everything easier to debug - examining the payloads lets you distinguish between errors in the export tool and errors in the API.  The text files themselves could then become test cases if there was a bug in the API, or be quickly hacked to contain correct payloads via find-and-replace if the export tool was wrong but we still needed the migration to finish right away.",1333458017

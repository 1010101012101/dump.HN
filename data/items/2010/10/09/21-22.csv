Chomsky is contemptuous of Havel. Chomsky embraces the Julien Benda view of the world. There are two sets of principles. They are the principles of power and privilege and the principles of truth and justice. If you pursue truth and justice it will always mean a diminution of power and privilege. If you pursue power and privilege it will always be at the expense of truth and justice. Benda says that the credo of any true intellectual has to be, as Christ said, ‘my kingdom is not of this world.’ Chomsky exposes the pretenses of those who claim to be the bearers of truth and justice. He shows that in fact these intellectuals are the bearers of power and privilege and all the evil that attends it.”</i>",1286661203

Facebook's stream became almost useless - for every one status update from one of your friends, there would be 6 more from apps like Farmville (seriously, Zynga's credibility for me went out the window when they started massively spamming everyone's streams).<p>Facebook had to backpedal quickly on that one and institute some pretty hard caps on what contexts allow apps to insert something into the stream, and the volume thereof also.<p>The more ""curating"" I have to do to make Facebook palatable to use, the less inclined I am to use it. For some people, photo tagging is one of those things (and IMHO ought to be fixed), and now they've introduced yet another thing you have to watch out for (on top of being a hawk on your privacy settings, in case Facebook decides to mess with them without your knowledge, again).<p>To be fair, this isn't the world-ending thing that a lot of outlets are claiming it is.

1775970,comment,1775663,1775957,0,0,lionhearted,,,"Go read the original piece for context. Here's a quote that I think is his thesis statement of the piece:<p>""Nor is there any discussion in the Times of the ""case of the missing bloodbath,"" although forecasts of a holocaust were urged by the U.S. leadership, official experts and the mass media over the entire course of the war in justifying our continued military presence.""<p>He's saying that there was no holocaust/bloodbath, and that it was a bad reason to justify American involvement in the region. He was wrong, there was a massive bloodbath. He and people like him argued against the American presence in the war and argued that it was a mostly peaceful local movement and that the Americans were the aggressors, and the Khmer Rouge and North Vietnamese were liberators.<p>He was wrong, and millions of people died as a result of people like Chomsky and Jane Fonda and anti-war protestors. I'm in Vietnam now and was in Cambodia a few months ago. These places are still less prosperous than they were before the war, everything is dirty, run down, broken, no safety, minimal infrastructure, and there's not much rule of law. Vietnam will recover eventually. Cambodia probably never will.<p>Had the United States and South Vietnam won, or at least fought to a standstill, South Vietnam would be more like South Korea today, and less like North Korea. Cambodia would be more like South Korea and less like North Korea. Chomsky, Fonda, and the protestors against the war did a massive disservice to the people of Southeast Asia. Millions dead as a result of their incorrect, ignorant moralizing. The United States and South Vietnam were winning militarily, and lost public opinion. Without people like Fonda and Chomsky to turn the tide, millions more survive and live in prosperity instead of horror and poverty and bloodshed.",1286660912

I never claimed otherwise.  I was making an argument as to the cultural conditioning that might lead women to be, on average, more risk averse than men.

However, we're not talking about inequities that apply to men, we're talking about a field in which there are demonstrably fewer women participating than men and we're asking why.  I was arguing that first, we need to go beyond a conclusion that states ""women are choosing not to do X, so it's not a problem"", second, that women may be risk averse for cultural reasons that may be worth addressing, and finally, by extension, that it's insufficient to claim that so long as women are legally treated the same way as men the playing field is equal so we shouldn't worry about it.<p>In other words, I'm not sure what your point is.",1286660326

1775908,story,,,3,1,Fiasco,"How Social Sites are downplaying our standing– pessimist personal thoughts.",,"My love affairs with the internet started with the exuberant flirtation with Geocities when I was a little kid. When I was a teen, I started blogging and creating my own stuffs. In 2009, Geocities showed me the real world of internet when they shut down their website. I realized how the world of internet is a house made of cards. You never know when your landlord is going to give you 24 hour notification of house collapse and you have to exit it no matter how impossible it is to take all those stuffs out from there. It was a moment of realization of mistrust to the virtual world for me at that time. It was also an emotional attachment and failure to understand the functional and structural deviant of internet progress. They are not a free stuff and their failure to outsmart their expectation can also lead to the chain reaction of dissatisfaction to customers or users like me on the other end.  This adds to the impending danger of loss of personal content in the time when certain internet component fails to continue the service. Letting the customer transfer or download the content might be somehow a right thing but there is always an emotional side to this. \nMy personal life was deeply involved with the Facebook phenomenon since 2007. To be honest Facebook became an integral part of life. Although I knew that it was not the only method of getting connected with friends, I was already submerged in its swamp. There was a phase of infatuation with Facebook, and a subliminal love and matured relationship. I emotionally invested heavily on Facebook by using its free service* to the fullest extent. Every important conversation online with my love, family and social circle was in my inbox. My inbox was filled with the inspirational message from my girlfriend, and my family.  My social circle and my organizations iam in used it in a best way of communicating with each other and I was learning this phenomenon to the best through every meeting decisions sent to my inbox when I was unable to attend them. Every trip I made had its imprint on Facebook. The photos and the link were another part of attachment. The narcissistic status I updated since 2007 is the representation of me since that time. There is a huge success story, behind creating a high school fan page I went in my childhood abroad, after getting permission from the school authority. They were able to start a scholarship fund for other students.  This is only a chunk of exuberance I was getting from facebook. Its application base, the like phenomenon, groups, and many more were making me a facebook addict. This addiction and facebook love affairs came to a halt when they mysteriously* suspended my account last Saturday. I wrote an email to them, but couldn’t get any reply till today except the automated email they sends to everyone whose account has been suspended. This facebook fiasco has added a feeling of emotional loss within myself. Will I be able to get my content back? The prose my girlfriend composed for me? The blessing my brother send in my inbox, the birthday message my sister sent? Those photos which are exclusively in facebook and are important to me personally for many reasons? How about those thousands of fans of whom iam the only sole messenger of our organization? How about my standing as a whole? Truly, it was my personal diary. Most of my friends whom I don’t communicate through phone might have thought I have blocked them and much more? I know I might have added some extra character in my name, poked my school’s girl friends or added some people whom I had never meet and made some group bashing something. But this is real me and this is how human beings are. They have a heritage and language which might not be solely represented by English username,  so they tend to express it. I never thought of backing those things because of the silly thought that facebook account is mine and it won’t be taken away from me without notification. \n	But I was wrong to trust something in virtual. I failed to learn from the Geocities debacle. Facebook has its own limits and rules. It does not particularly care person like me when its algorithm tells them this user id 123456 has been using facebook more often than what it is supposed to be in normal condition.  Will I ever upload photos in flickr instead of keeping them in my hard drive? Will I keep every email on gmail undeleted? Will I use blogger and wordpress as my personal diary and journal? Will I be trusting the Chrome OS and use it? I don’t know. To the most part all we are subjugated to trust and use the services in internet and we tend to do so, no matter how some of our emotional attachment and social standing are left unaddressed. \n…………………………\nTo be continued.",1286659038

Seems this would have the advantage of a lot more capacity, and while I'm not sure of the performance of the CPU it should be essentially guaranteed.   If you just keep it for a year, and consider the $140 for the plug a total write off, this comes to about $16 a month.<p>Is this a good deal compared to VPS offerings?  It seems like it would have to be, unless the CPU is very slow.<p>Amazon micro instances are close, but you can't run a web service from them since they can lose their CPU for seconds at a time (as I understand it.)",1286658186

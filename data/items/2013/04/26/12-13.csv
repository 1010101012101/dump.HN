The reason the city's expensive is because top-talent <i>people like me</i> come here and work their asses off, providing a healthy substrate for economic activity that generates lots of value. <i>I'm bringing the real fucking ingredient</i> (talent) and not these unproductive and fucking <i>uncultured</i> absentee landlord fucksticks (half of whom don't even live in the city, and what the fuck are we doing allowing foreign speculators, i.e. third-world despots and their henchmen, to own property here when we can't even provide for our own fucking people?) who've stolen most of my savings. Who the fucking fuck thought ""Talent Pays"" is a fair or good fucking system? It wasn't fucking me, I'll tell you that much.<p>The talent argument for startups only being in star cities is specious. All it would take is for a few hundred top engineers to move to any city X in unison and that would start something. Fuck, you might be able to build a kernel with 20. You could use a #4-10 tech hub (Austin, Seattle) or somewhere that's not even on the map (e.g. Iowa City).<p>Now, if you're selling to a specific clientele, living in a star city makes sense. If 80% of your clients are going to be financial firms, you want to be in New York. I get that. But there's so much that can be done from anywhere; so why is all the investor money limited to a couple of cities?<p>I am a genetic contrarian so I tend to be one of the first to see when going assumptions are wrong. I think that if you want to build a stable company, you want to be <i>outside of</i> the fuxpensive star cities right now. When the culture is one where you have to become some parasitic VP who doesn't do anything, and then ""exit"", just to own a house, you're not nurturing the lifelong software engineers who will <i>actually</i> be motivated to build awesome shit. Whereas outside of the star cities, your burn rate is lower, and the ""job hopping"" climate isn't as fluid (which is good and bad) so you can really invest in people and build for the long-term, instead of being <i>fucking toast</i> if Facebook doesn't buy you before trick-or-treat night.",1366980175

I would have thought narrow lines would produce the problem that those specific lines would become unavailable for study, or would be freely mixed with the ""real"" data in confusing ways. It didn't occur to me that they could simply be subtracted in a deterministic way.<p>Your original thought is basically correct:  we do lose the ability to do any meaningful work at the wavelengths of the lamp emission lines.  But the damage is concentrated at a few wavelengths.  So we trade having noise over the entire spectrum for a few really, really noisy pieces of spectrum.  It's generally a excellent tradeoff.<p>But even low pressure sodium lamps have some emission spread over a large wavelength range, so it is becoming increasingly difficult to do optical work near major urban areas.  In the long run most of those sites will probably transition to mostly IR work.",1366980140

Major oil price fluctuations can be damaging, because too high prices cause demand destruction and too low will bankrupt marginal producers.<p>b) We don't know what type of decline to expect, but it might be steeper due to EOR (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enhanced_oil_recovery"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enhanced_oil_recovery</a>) techniques depleting the fields faster.<p>c) We don't really know how large part of the global recoverable supply we've consumed, because it is likely several OPEC-countries have reported exaggerating reserve data in past in order to increase their production share.",1366977628

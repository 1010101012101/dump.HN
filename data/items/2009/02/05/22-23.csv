It addresses the problem in a round-about way using economic incentives to filter ""non-HN"" users, or trolls. Inefficient.<p>In order to qualify site membership, why not require a non-monetary merit test? For example, one can only sign-up or comment/submit for a month if they can solve a simple computer problem appropriate to the site content, in this case maybe deciphering a simply double-encoded string (say, HTML entities + rot13 or base64 or something).

The value of tests in catching regressions in code you didn't write, didn't realize was there, and don't understand is immense.  It's one kind of difficult to not introduce regressions in 100k lines of code that you were deeply involved with; it's a whole different deal to walk into 100k lines of someone else's code and try to change it without breaking anything.<p>Unit testing is like vaccination:  it's good for <i>me</i> that I'm vaccinated against smallpox, but it's also really good for <i>you</i> that I won't be getting sick and giving it to you, and your ability to avoid vaccination (or testing) and still function is often directly correlated to how well everyone else is vaccinated (or how well they've tested their code so you know when you're breaking it).<p>Those don't always have to be <i>unit</i> tests in the strictest sense, so you could perhaps argue that a test that breaks as a result of unrelated changes isn't really a ""unit"" test because it wasn't properly isolated, but I really hate those sorts of language arguments.

I like the extensibility Firefox offers, but I absolutely abhor all the quirks that it has on OS X[1].<p>So, is it too much to ask for a browser that both integrates well on OS X, and offers the extensibility many developers and users enjoy?<p>1: For example, Firefox has trouble opening zip/tar files with the Archive Utility on OS X. After a long while googling, I found a solution that gets most of the way there (On 10.4, there was a service running in the background that could handle this; in 10.5, you need to tell Firefox to open these with /System/Library/CoreServices/Archive Utility.app).

Interest is API / 12 per month so principle gives (1 + API / 1200) ^12 return per year.  (1.01)^12 = 12.8% that's after taxes and powerful.  They should also be making more money over time even as their debt is less of a problem and you feel good that debt is shrinking fast.  Which should help the psychological situation.<p>Using 12% an extra 1000 down saves them 10$ in next month and every month after that it keeps compounding.  At 1000$ per month over interest you pay down 12,700 in principle in one year (assuming you don't reduce your payment as interest drops). In 3 years they are saving 430$ / month, but assume they roll that savings into paying down principle in a ~9 years it's all payed off.<p>But, they don't need to wait that long, they just need to find the right cushion so they feel comfortable taking on more debt.  Pay down 82k (saving 820/month) in 5 years and the world looks like a brighter place, your making more money, and buying a house might be a good idea.

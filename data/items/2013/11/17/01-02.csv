6747196,comment,6729915,6734514,1,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"> In many cases there is no recipient of the money because we&#x27;re talking about the bottom 80% in terms of wealth who typically just end up leaving the money in some form of savings account or paying down some debt.<p>How do you mean there is no recipient? In that case the recipient is the lender or the bank, which allows them to lend the money to someone else.<p>You might also be surprised how good for the economy paying down debts can be in the long term. The person who paid the debt is not paying interest on it anymore, and has now improved their credit worthiness, which reduces the interest they pay on all of their remaining debts. The interest not paid can be spent or used to pay further debts (virtuous cycle). Or in the future the borrower can leverage the increased credit worthiness into more borrowing at lower monthly payments, allowing increased future spending.<p>This is really one of those situations where politics and reality collide. Having the middle class pay down their debts is great for the economy in the long-term. But it may not do anything much <i>today</i>, which is what politicians care about when they&#x27;re running to reelection. Hence we have a bunch of backward-facing policies that prioritize spending over saving when they are both important to economic growth and the choices between one and the other would be more efficiently made by the people.",1384653477

They have just carried on as usual. Now it has just made it easier with spammers, blackhats now able to leave links on their comments. Sure they can be deleted with an hour or so but that one hour is all you need to spread your payload.<p>The only people who the real name policy punishes is the real users. The ones who do everything right. The ones who do not wish to have their lives outed this way.<p>Now I&#x27;m gay, and have no problem being out online but at home in public is another problem. I&#x27;ve never moved from my Childhood home and I live in a small town, its pretty easy to know who I am, so I made it a policy to never link the two so I don&#x27;t have to do deal with Homophobia on my Doorstep. Its a small town and news soon spreads. I don&#x27;t have a Google Plus account and am moving away from Gmail for this reason. I never ever use a real photo online. Facebook is only used for minor things on an anonymous email address with a blank photo. Even then I hate it and do not use it for personal stuff.<p>If you are really concerned about privacy, just delete your Gmail, Google Plus account. Get your wallet out and move to a paid alternative where you will not have to worry about having your email connected to a social network. Buy a domain name, use a private whois service like at NearlyFreeSpeech.Net so you can move between providers over the years but keep the same address.<p>If you really must comment on YouTube, create a Google Plus profile on a brand new Gmail account for those exact purposes. Understand that anything you write online can be traced back to you. We are not anonymous despite if you never use a real name. Google knows more about you and your interests than any other entity and it has years of your surfing and searching habits in its database.<p>Edited to add, if you hate the comments on your own YouTube videos, just turn them off.",1384652123

In biology it was once thought that more &quot;omics&quot; (genomics, metabolomics, etc) would be better and lead to a better prediction of negative outcomes. Apparently, it is not, mostly, at least not yet.<p>It seems that for many important events (crime/cancer) a larger mass of untargeted data does not make determining causative effects much easier.  Personal expertise in a particular disease area almost always trumps the most fervent of statisticians and &quot;big data&quot; biologists. I imagine it is similar for crimes (for example, the local police would know who is a trouble-maker, or a congressman would know which bankers are shady).<p>I don&#x27;t think this will forever be the case, but for now, detection of pre-crime and pre-cancer are in the realms of fiction, at least in the majority of cases.",1384651036

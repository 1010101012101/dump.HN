1002011,comment,1001834,1001932,0,0,unalone,,,"Dude, have you <i>talked</i> to hairdressers? I have. When I was younger I'd be surprised at how much they were comfortable talking about. We'd talk about cinema and literature and politics and they'd have an opinion about everything. It struck me how these people, who I'd once thought were emptyheaded, were actually smart, well-balanced people who just happened to love their occupation. Then it made me realize that perhaps I was the emptyheaded one for believing in the idea of the ""average joe"".<p>Now I am a little bit older — not much older, mind you — and I've learned how stupid it is to believe that anybody could be at all considered average. In various positions I've talked to a slew of people I'd once have dismissed for their commonality. I don't think I've ever met somebody who I'd call stupid. A lot of them you'd think are stupid until you talk to them and realize they've just got a few stupid beliefs ingrained in them and beyond that are as bright as anybody. The more people you meet, the more you realize how stupid it is to sequester yourself away in an ivory tower or a dank basement, to assume that you're somehow an elite being who other people simply cannot understand.<p>Hell, that's why I became a writer. I learned that to understand others, I had to learn how others understood me.",1261087147

1001998,comment,1001834,1001936,0,0,unalone,,,"Can we try a thought experiment? Take the statements you just made and look for generalizations.<p>""Nongeeks self-select themselves out of certain fields."" ""There is a certain air of superiority (and ignorance) conveyed in saying that geeks don't shower."" ""[T]he traits exhibited by people who are interested in geeky things are related to the traits exhibited by people who want to go into geeky fields."" ""It follows that they might be better about doing things which require obsessive traits, like writing code. (Or maybe geeks are just better at everything...).""<p>From reading these comments and knowing nothing about you, the attitude that I get from these comments is twofold: You think that being a geek is a good thing (or that geeks are inherently superior), and that there is somewhat of a persecution of geeks going on. The message I read here (which might not at <i>all</i> be what you wanted to say, mind you!) is: ""Nongeeks don't want to be geeks because geeks are smarter.""<p>Now, regardless of whether or not that's the case, or even whether or not you believe that, that's the message that's coming out. It's somewhat off-putting and exclusive. In your writing, you yourself are excluding so-called non-geeks; the fact that you're willing to distinguish geeks as a distinct and special category says something in and of itself. That all agrees with the author's conclusion.<p>I agree with the author's conclusion myself, not because I'm in the field or have done research about it but because it makes sense when you reason it out. The community that's formed around this field has certain peculiarities. The emphasis on comic books and graphic novels and Star Trek and energy drinks that's mentioned, for instance. These are each odd things that lack a distinguishing trait. It's not like the art in comic books is better than art in other media forms, or that the story is better. It's not like Star Trek was a geekier show than others; certainly it's not highbrow entertainment. And as far as drugs of choice go, energy drinks are such a specific sort of caffeinated beverage, designed to force a drug into the body rather than following a so-called natural food flow.<p>If we were going to go from the assumption that the comp sci field had an even distribution of interests, we'd be hard pressed to explain those certain prominences. Why is there no vodka alongside the Red Bull, no cigarettes or cigars? Why aren't other art forms represented as much as comic books? What's the group fascination with Star Trek? When they're all presented together, they're no longer idiosyncrasies. They have certain traits in common that speak about the people who imbibe them. They're all things obtainable from younger ages, they all have a certain visceral immediacy to them, they're all to some degree static and unchanging. People who drink energy drinks tend to stick with a single favorite; they'll spend years with one drink, unchanging. I don't think I'm wrong in saying that there's a certain comfort in the repetition, in knowing what you're going to get every time.<p>Furthermore, people with these specific interests tend to have other characteristics. Am I right in thinking you value what people think more than you do what they look like? Or even that you think people who judge others based on looks are acting in a shallow fashion? Studies suggest you like either classic or alternative rock or electronica. Perhaps I could place a bet on your liking Monty Python, or enjoying Firefly? (This isn't you, anonjon, this is the collective ""you"" of the geeks in the survey. I'm sure not <i>all</i> of this applies to you.)<p>Along with that, so-called ""geeks"" favor muted colors and t-shirts. They have particular commonalities in fashion. And they certainly have similar personality traits, which include introversion, arrogance, and short tempers. Not every person has all these traits, but they're frequent <i>enough</i> that we can't just say they're common traits in all human beings. They're certainly specific to this social clique.<p>The backlash against nerds is almost entirely one formed from individual opinions forming. Perhaps it's unfair that people have decided comp sci majors in black t-shirts who like Star Trek are less likely to be fun or friendly than a random person from another sampling of society, but that's how it's working, and that's the cause for a lot of ""geek"" bias. It also makes sense. When you spend your time reading anime rather than following sports, certain casual conversations become very difficult for both parties. I've got former friends who're very stereotypical geeks, and I've forced them into social gatherings, and when I listen to the conversations they get into it's cringe-worthy. Either they don't realize how awkward they are, or they do it deliberately in order to justify their social alienation.<p>So that's what the study is saying. It says, girls who have been shown these standard set-ups see enough cues to make them think perhaps they'd be better off somewhere else. That's entirely logical, isn't it? And the solution would be for our culture to expand and embrace more things, to reflect ""normal"" society in its diversity and lack of a hive mind. Until then, it will continue to be treated like what it's perceived to be: A bright, socially retarded group that's content with being largely outsiders.",1261086732

I record the slot on the board (1-20, Bull) hit given the launch angles and force of the throw.  I let this ""simulation"" run until I had 50 samples per board slot.<p>The simulation is run once ahead of time.  The simulation results are bundled with the app.<p>When it becomes the AI's turn, it picks a slot to aim at based on the game variation and state of the game.  Currently, it chooses rather poorly in Cricket.<p>Then it picks a random sample from the sample pool recorded from the aforementioned simulation.  Based on the user-chosen competence level, it adds a small, random amount of error to the angle and velocity associated with the selected sample.  Finally, the dart is launched using the calculated angles and force.<p>While the app is Objective C, the offline simulation was written in Python.

This is especially relevant in our field.<p>For one thing, I've only run into a handful of software companies who have a hard grade cutoff anywhere. None of the big names (MS, GOOG, etc) do it, and IMHO if you understand what makes a great hacker, you wouldn't do it either. NVidia was the last company of note I dealt with that had a hard grade cutoff. I didn't make it - and many other talented programmers I know didn't either... their loss I suppose. I do know the people who <i>were</i> selected, and none of them can really be called good hackers - at most competent coders.<p>I've seen this pattern time and time again - in college the ones with the highest grades were the least employable. I had the pleasure of being in a program that <i>required</i> internships, and invariably the people with middle-of-the-road marks (3.5 is well above middle) had a <i>much</i> easier time finding employment than the ones at the top. The amount of effort it takes to stay at the top precludes one from doing the side projects that invariably makes the main difference between a merely competent programmer and a talented hacker. The top marks had no problem landing interviews, but had trouble converting interviews to offers.<p>Sure, you can claim that a truly elite individual can make the grades <i>and</i> do all the side hacking projects <i>and</i> make it home to cook dinner. Reality of the matter is, these guys are exceptionally rare, and odds are you're not paying half as much as you would need to hire one of them ;) By hiring in that range you're getting an unproductive mix of academic overachievers mixed with a handful of pure geniuses. By targeting a lower grade bracket you're getting a much more even mix of people <i>good</i> at the job you want them to do, but aren't so good at academics.",1261085540

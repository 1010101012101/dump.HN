If someone said something that cost me millions, I'd be livid.<p><i>Additionally, concern over false references is a bit strange from the guy who just finished telling us it's a good reference for him, ""or war"".</i><p>If someone fires me and won't agree on a good reference, then it's on. If you're cash-strapped and absolutely can't afford a severance, fine. I'll bounce. If you decide to fuck with my career later on or interfere with future relationships, then war has been started and for me to fight back is appropriate.<p>In normal circumstances I don't ""coach"" references and trust them to give a decent account, but we were talking, in this thread, about getting fired.

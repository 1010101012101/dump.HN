I&#x27;ll make an attempt here, but understand that you have me on my heels :)<p>If I look around my office I see lots of things that I could name with that many words, because they&#x27;re composed of a number of really important properties. The <i>reason</i> they&#x27;re composed of all of those properties is to serve some purpose, and their name tends to reflect that purpose.<p>So I guess I&#x27;d ask if all of the properties in that part name reflect some holistic idea and suggest a name based on that. But I know I&#x27;m probably wrong. The people who make that part may not <i>really</i> know why all those properties are together.. in as much as they have customers that use it for lots of different things. It&#x27;ll probably end up in things that haven&#x27;t been invented yet, who knows.<p>Or maybe we could come up with a holistic name, but because it was unspecific we wouldn&#x27;t know <i>exactly</i> what it did, and anyone about to purchase that part would have to read the spec-sheet (source code, to briefly exit our analogy).<p>Let&#x27;s say we built a device that included that thing. What would we call it when traversing the schematics? We&#x27;d probably call it the phototransistor, because everything else is detailed enough to be &#x27;source code&#x27;.<p>You caught me being hyperbolic, though. You&#x27;re right.

That&#x27;s something I&#x27;d find very useful for debugging.<p>Edit 1: Looks like they build the memes exactly that way. It still needs to convert the canvas to a data: url first, however, which might be a bit slow?<p>Edit 2: Looks like there might be a better, but non-standard and non-portable way of achieving that in WebKit browsers:  <a href=""http://updates.html5rocks.com/2012/12/Canvas-driven-background-images"" rel=""nofollow"">http://updates.html5rocks.com/2012/12/Canvas-driven-backgrou...</a>",1372511222

The letter only gives 14 days for customers to pony up some money or their pictures get hidden, and 30 days until they&#x27;re deleted.<p>I know it&#x27;s not a huge amount of money that you&#x27;re asking, but it is sudden and can rub customers the wrong way.<p>If you don&#x27;t have it, it might be useful for you to offer a &quot;download all your images & data&quot; option, as a sign of good faith with your customers.  Maybe after 30 days you can archive the photos into cold storage (something cheap, maybe Amazon Glacier), offer a way for users to get their data back, and then permanently delete it further into the future.<p>[0] <a href=""http://picturepush.com/gopro"" rel=""nofollow"">http://picturepush.com/gopro</a>",1372511081

My only issue with it was he introduced readers to bstring instead of something UTF, but still better than vanilla chars. I wouldn&#x27;t even know an UTF library for C with permissive license and lightweight on top of my head. C coding is all about memory management and data structures layout.",1372510863

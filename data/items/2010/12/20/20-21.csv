If I am the sole shareholder of the LLC, can't I just close it and transfer the assets (which would probably just be my code) to the new C-Corp? How messy is it? Is it manageable by a decent lawyer, because I'll need that anyway when I start taking investment.<p>Longer version, with more background:<p>I have a site off the ground, but potential customers are balking at the lack of a terms of service. So I need to set up some sort of corporation. The agile programmer in me says set up an LLC. It's the simplest thing that could possibly solve this problem, and I can change it later.<p>On the other hand, I am planning on seeking angel investment within 2-3 months, and I hear investors prefer a C-Corp. But setting up a C-Corp in Delaware seems like a big hassle right now, when I just want to make a terms of service and accept some payments to verify my business model. My advisor says he can connect me to a good silicon valley law firm that will work on deferred compensation, but I'm worried this process will be too slow for now. I just want to deal with this and focus on getting more leverage, then reincorporate when needed.<p>So anyway, is the process of converting an LLC to a C Corp so messy that I should take time now to ""get it right,"" or can I get away with just moving forward on my own, without lawyers, and dealing with it later, when I have more leverage?<p>Thanks for any advice.",1292878504

Mother Nature's little growers are optimized for the amount of sunlight they receive on flat ground, and by trying to stack farms on top of each other you utterly inevitably mathematically reduce the amount of sunlight each floor can get to substantially less than that, because the floors occlude each other, except the top floor. To the extent that people fail to take that into account they really are failing at physics badly and Monbiot is correct to criticize them.<p>I think under the right circumstances and with plausible technological development this can make sense, but he's absolutely correct that doing it with current technology is completely infeasible and useless. My position is actually not what he is criticizing, and I'm still open to the possibility that while the future may look different, the actual best solution is something not yet evident. We may also simply reduce the costs of transportation such that growing something 1000 miles away simply isn't that big a deal ecologically. (We really, really, <i>really</i> need cheap energy, cheap in all senses of the term, ecologically as well as economically. And there are feasible possibilities.)",1292878288

2025704,comment,2024392,2025167,0,0,jerf,,,"Expanding on what pkulak said, it's the <i>mail servers</i> that send mail, not users. There will actually be quite a long time during which everybody can still reach an IPv4 server. They may even reach it over an IPv6 address, but when the mail leaves ""your corporate network"" or ""Comcast"", it can be over IPv4. So even a brand new ISP in a brand new country with brand new network addresses and no other IPv4 connectivity can still have one IPv4 mail server somewhere. (IPv4 addresses aren't so rare than ISPs can't have them, what we can't do is hand them out to every individual on the planet.)<p>And since in the early phases of the transition anybody wanting to send mail will need to do this anyhow, there will be a long period of time (couple of years) where pretty much all mail coming from an IPv6 address will be a spammer trying to get around IPv4 IP reputation lists. And the solution will be to blacklist IPv6 as a whole, and that solution will be deployed until it becomes too painful. Following that will be whitelisting specific known good IPv6 addresses, which will probably hold for at least another year. Only then will be actually be thrust into the chaos of a network where you can't use blacklisting, and, well, I actually still have some ideas on that front so I'm not sure it's hopeless even then. (But I can't test the ideas against reality until about year 2 of this process at the earliest.)<p>Again, let me highlight I'm not <i>endorsing</i> this; my first post has been bouncing up and down between 0 and 1 and I suspect there's some people missing this point. I'm just saying, it's what is going to happen. Mail filtering is very much an engineering problem, not a science problem, and you can sing the virtues of IPv6 to the mail server admins all you want but they do not care.",1292877818

2025686,comment,2025660,2025660,0,0,EGreg,,,"There are two factors here which aren't mentioned in the video, that I wanted to touch on:<p>1) The birth rates. In countries that heavily favored male sons, and possibly had a limit on the number of children a family could have, the girls now have it better, so it's more desirable for many to have a daughter because she would grow up to have a better life.<p>2) We may not feel what she is talking about, being technologists and pushers of envelopes. In the fascinating article ""What is good about men"", which I will post later (here it is, by the way: <a href=""http://www.psy.fsu.edu/~baumeistertice/goodaboutmen.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.psy.fsu.edu/~baumeistertice/goodaboutmen.htm</a>) a great case is made for why men are more drawn to math, hard science, computers, logical thinking quiet reflection, and most of all, risk and changing the world.<p>The economy has changed from one where men's strength was used, to one where brains and ideas and relationships are key. When it comes to changing the world and computer programming, I would say men definitely dominate the landscape in terms of their numbers and enthusiasm (certainly there are female software entrepreneurs, but there are not that many). So from our perspective, it may seem that men are still ""running the world"" in a sense. But in fact, economically, women are taking over. Because most men are not computer programmers or entrepreneurs.<p>Increasingly men are taking on jobs where they sit by a computer and typ. In the past, the vast majority of typists were women. Imagine a male secretary in the 50s! But today men seem to be evolving into two classes: the intellectuals, who work a lot, and the rest (creative, promoters, etc.) whose dynamic is very different. Less work and more play. Women working longer hours than them. I wonder if in 10 years it won't look more like the lions: the females hunt and the male eats and has sex. And the difference this time around is, birth control has been invented.<p>Of course I am exaggerating but it is intriguing to consider where society as a whole is headed.",1292877471
2025685,comment,2024328,2025414,0,0,mattmanser,,,"Some programmers like to know everything about a language they are using, knowing all the edge cases, keywords no-one else uses, the exact execution order of tokens and weird quirks. They are masters of complete understanding, and very occasionally this mastery allows them to come up with a revolution in the way things are done. Let's call these the Scholars.<p>A lot of others don't though, the joy of programming for them is not mastery of the grammar but writing the story. They would rather use a combination of run it and see and diving into the documentation only when totally necessary. Do not mistake this for an amateur who is cargo culting their code, these programmers know exactly what their code does, they just learn the bits they need as they need them. Let's call these the Mavericks.<p>I struggled to find neutral words for both schools of thought, don't read too much into the names I picked.<p>Both types can be excellent hackers. And of course we have a spectrum in between Scholars and Mavericks.<p>I am a Maverick. I find the Scholars, with their memorization of all the rules, to be both awe inspiring and entirely tiresome at the same time. I don't enjoy sitting down with a cocoa and a spec because I'd prefer to be programming. There is a vast swathe of every spec and every library that is entirely useless for the task I have at hand, quite often for any task I would ever do. I see anything which forces me to learn that useless knowledge as a waste of time.<p>Use semi-colons for every statement is a simple and easily remembered rule, one which takes no effort compared to reading a spec that delivers me little or even no benefit. I will also tend to forget these rules because my mind just doesn't see it as particularly useful information, I don't use it enough. I don't have any motivation to force that knowledge in my brain through learning practices because to a Maverick, it's boring.<p>There is no lack of curiosity or education in the latter type of programmer. I read this type of article which Scholars so often write with exasperation. Mavericks just don't care about learning the intricacies of language grammar compared to doing something else in programming. That something else is just as intellectually demanding.<p>Please remember that the next time you come across a Maverick, we're just of different schools, not of different ability.",1292877470

In a year it is likely to be obsoleted by engines based around other HTML5 technologies(CSS and SVG make for stronger ""general 2D scenegraph"" technologies, and WebGL is faster). It's a feature-poor engine - the highlights are the collision system and map editor - and the existing free ones are similar.<p>If you do buy this engine, it's probably because of ignorance, which in itself is a bad sign. There's reams of game code lying around the internet, and the most important thing isn't having the code but having an understanding of how it works. You are better served by buying a book on engine creation, reading that, and reading open source engine code, than to buy one set of documented engine code and only read that.<p>The only time this equation differs is when we're talking about features that are not dime-a-dozen and are truly a pain to integrate properly.

But along about 12 to 15 depending on gender and personality, you'd better pick a spot and stay there for a few years.  More years if you have overlapping kids.",1292875442

I would live on a diving boat cruising over coral reefs and code games between dives. (I'd also hire my gf to cook.)<p>>>And that doesn't even touch the reasons people want to be rich - like private jets and angel investing and art collecting and space tourism, etc.<p>On the second level, you can get what is high status among the <i>really</i> cool and rich nerds -- your own space program.

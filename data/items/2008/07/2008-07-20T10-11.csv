251278,comment,250704,250757,0,0,jerry5,,,"I've sometimes wondered whether IT isn't becoming the 'core' part of a business. I.e. the one that's most complex and drives the competitive edge and success of a business. I have worked in IT in many different industries and often enough found the 'business' part of the business to be easy to pick up while it sometimes took ages and a lot of brainpower to get on top of the technology. In other words, IT people can understand 'businesss' but business people can't understand IT. So, in the future, instead of having a bank with an IT department, we'd have an IT company with a bank department. They'd probably switch sooner from banking to insurance than from one IT infrastructure to another.<p>I think amazon is a good prototype for this. It's a tech company that also sells books. They later added all sorts of other crap like electronics, then stuff that they don't even deliver but where they just act as a front for other retailers and finally they are now offering their IT services purely by themselves (S3, EC2).",1216550731

It is better than capitalism by a very long way. It's a complicated idea, slightly difficult to grasp, but  given any problem it will robustly yield the best result for the community.

251275,comment,250704,251014,0,0,cturner,,,"You're right in that: LaTeX doesn't suffer from that criticism, and LaTeX is pretty cool, particularly in terms of the quality of the output you get. This system will very likely end up with a LaTeX filter for print rendering.<p>Limitations of LaTeX for what I want:<p>1) It does too much - I want to be able to have documents generated once and then offer on multiple outputs. I can't do that if people use features of the platform that go beyond the 'web renderer'. The featureset you need for the save format of a document production system is actually very low. You need to be able to capture five grades of headings, support two types of emphasis, ordered and unordered lists that can nest, tabular data. I don't think anything else is needed. So in this sense, of existing technologies docbook is a lot closer to what I need than LaTeX.<p>2) Whatever system you end up coming up with, it needs to be able to support Microsoft Word as a frontend because users are sold on that interface, although they really don't care what goes on underneath. While I could have my Word plugin generating LaTeX, it would be much more sensible to have it turned into an intermediate format of simple XML and then transform into LaTeX for what it's good at.<p>Good suggestion. It does have a place in the plan :)",1216550126

Things like, for example, metaprogramming are massively helpful when interacting with HTML. Collectively we all might have had a lot less work to do.",1216549243
251273,comment,250930,250950,0,0,Prrometheus,,,"Marx was never as influential in Economics as he was in Politics. His political philosophy is interesting and challenging while his Economics always seems chosen to suit his politics. It wasn't bad compared to the Economics of his contemporaries, but it had a short shelf-life. He lost the battle of ideas pretty rapidly, and fairly in my opinion.<p>True, one will be a better Economist if he understands the evolution of Economic thought in the 19th century, but there is no reason to single out Marx for particular study by the average student.",1216549163

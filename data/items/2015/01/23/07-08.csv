I was talking about price manipulation and arbitrage in a scenario where there is no delay on withdraws/deposits.<p>To put it another way, if price manipulation is happening, you typically won&#x27;t notice a price discrepancy.  The reason is because of arbitrage.  Since price discrepancies are lucrative, people will use arbitrage to take advantage (and hence eliminate) any price discrepancy.  The end result is that the price was manipulated across all exchanges, even though only one exchange is being shady.",1421999831

You can&#x27;t have it both way of putting your code under a license like that and then complaining when someone uses it in a way you don&#x27;t like. It seems very hypocritical to me to be angry if he is using your license properly.

I&#x27;ve tried to learn Haskell several times, and every time I meet the Monad section in the tutorial I lost my concentration. One of my friends who is proficient in Haskell told me to just start coding without trying to understand the advanced concepts, but I wasn&#x27;t inclined to do that as Monads were hanging over my head, and I really wanted to understand what they are before writing some piece of code.<p>Funnily enough, things were changed after I learned Rust. (I know I&#x27;m saying like a Rust zealot, but it&#x27;s true!) After using Rust&#x27;s `Option` type, and realizing its `.map()` and `.and_then()` are similar to `fmap` and `>>=` in Haskell, I finally began to grasp what functors and monads are. And that led me to understand the &quot;implementation details&quot; of Haskell. Before that, I thought `seq` was purely written in Haskell. But it wasn&#x27;t. It is basically a compiler magic, and GHC specializes `seq` to allow eager evaluation. The same thing goes with the IO type; the monad itself has nothing to do with making I/O be done. I/O is possible solely thanks to the implementation details of the IO type, which resides in GHC. Plus, I can also guess that that part of GHC is probably not written in Haskell, because it is not possible to make side effects in &quot;real&quot; Haskell.<p>So, Rust was my admirable Haskell teacher. (Thanks, Mozilla!) It&#x27;s like a stepping stone between the imperative world and the functional world. The funny thing again is, after having fun with Rust for months, now I have less reasons to go back to learn Haskell... Rust is already <i>too</i> powerful, performant, and easy to understand, so Haskell feels less appealing to me.

And do-notation is kind of a DSL with a totally different feel than the rest of the language. So getting started writing even simple toy programs in Haskell requires you to learn two languages.

The planes would be lighter and use less fuel and money was saved. On rare occasions however the amount of fuel was insufficient, and the plane would crash. This problem was solved by the engineers of the company by the development of a special OOF (out-of-fuel) mechanism. In emergency cases a passenger was selected and thrown out of the plane. (When necessary, the procedure was repeated.) A large body of theory was developed and many publications were devoted to the problem of properly selecting the victim to be ejected. Should the victim be chosen at random? Or should one choose the heaviest person? Or the oldest? Should passengers pay in order not to be ejected, so that the victim would be the poorest on board? And if for example the heaviest person was chosen, should there be a special exception in case that was the pilot? Should first class passengers be exempted? Now that the OOF mechanism existed, it would be activated every now and then, and eject passengers even when there was no fuel shortage. The engineers are still studying precisely how this malfunction is caused.</i><p><a href=""http://lwn.net/Articles/104179/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lwn.net/Articles/104179/</a>",1421997097

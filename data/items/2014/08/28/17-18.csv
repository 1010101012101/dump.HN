8238711,comment,8237996,8238644,2,0,kipple,,,"Agreed, especially about integration. Many web apps expose their functionality with RESTful JSON APIs or similar. It seems to me that integrating data & functionality from across web apps is far more common than in the desktop setting. I&#x27;ve never built a desktop app, but just from a users perspective most of my desktop apps are isolated pieces of functionality while web apps are entangled in the greater web community.<p>My background is mostly web app development, and when I started I was using open technologies such as PHP and NodeJS. This summer I&#x27;m doing some work in Visual Studio with a C# .NET MVC 4000 web app. Visual Studio is a slick interface _mostly_ with some great convenience _usually_ but overall it feels suffocating compared to slapping together random tangles of open web technologies.

Of course, despite this, there were lots of obvious advantages of moving to Windows from DOS.

Sharpness is for young programmers, with or without weed.<p>I must say that I do not know any programmers who have lasted into their 50&#x27;s without being regular stoners. Something about cannabis seems to protect them from the dementia that is so prevalent among people in this field 20 or more years.<p>Relative to this article, though- even though I&#x27;m a big advocate of the herb I&#x27;m familiar with the research done in Israel, Spain, and elsewhere, and one common thread is that cannabis alters the growing brain in ways that may not be desirable. I wish we could talk to our kids intelligently about it. Whether it&#x27;s legal or not, it is not a good idea for a teenager to smoke a lot of weed. One puff isn&#x27;t going to kill you, but once a week might impact your brain, and give you less psychic space to explore when you get high later in life.<p>Patience, children!<p>I&#x27;ve always used a company&#x27;s drug-testing policy as a litmus test.

Whether it&#x27;s helping someone navigate a political landscape, or just making sure they have the equipment necessary to get the job done, there&#x27;s grunt work.

Yes, we have backtracked in so many ways from the speed and functionality of native applications.  However, I&#x27;d prefer to accept that the web will be the dominant programming platform from now on, and use the capabilities that we had with native applications as inspiration to make the web stack better.  Yes, It can be annoying to hear people breathlessly describe the responsiveness of some new javascript framework as if it&#x27;s something that native apps haven&#x27;t had for ages.  However, I don&#x27;t think that should make us want to go back.

We failed.<p>The problem we ran into is that it&#x27;s cool, but Twitter (and others) already accomplish the same thing with hashtags. People just don&#x27;t like to add new channels to their everyday lives.<p>Beyond that, it was impossible (for us) to monetize, even though we had connections to creative agencies and large companies that were marketing events. The problem is that we weren&#x27;t reducing pain points or adding operational efficiency, and thus paying us was never urgent. Meetings would get pushed off by weeks at a time, and it was hard to get anyone to make concrete moves forward.<p>To give you an idea of what we were experiencing, imagine that you&#x27;re selling your car. Which is a higher priority, getting a scratch fixed or having it waxed?<p>It&#x27;s very possible that you&#x27;ll make your money back from the waxing when you&#x27;re able to sell it for more money, but that&#x27;s only a possibility. You&#x27;re going to first spend your money on the repairs and then on the appearance. For the business world, increasing operational efficiency is like the repair, while marketing/social media is like the appearance.<p>People in the business world just don&#x27;t like to pay out for something that MIGHT have ROI. That&#x27;s why creative budgets are some of the first to get crunched in a recession.",1409248126

For example, interoperability between web apps has gotten steadily better as HTTP APIs have evolved, today&#x27;s generation of web apps often make interoperability a selling point (Slack is a good example).  From a traditional single-platform native developer the mechanism for this looks crufty and ill-defined, but that is the price you pay for a truly open standard not controlled by a monolithic entity.  For instance, for all the beauty and elegance of Microsoft Visual Studio, there is no way they can bring that experience to OS X and Linux, let alone all the mobile platforms.<p>Native app developers have been wringing their hands over the &quot;inferiority&quot; of the web for 15 years now, but all the while ignoring that the web does something which <i>no technology has ever done</i> in terms of ubiquity.  And what enabled this was the trojan horse of HTML/HTTP&#x27;s initial simplicity.  Hell, the simple HTML documents for which the format is ideally suited still outnumber apps by an order of magnitude, but the beauty is you have one platform that can support everything on the complexity continuum from the simplest documents all the way up to sophisticated business apps.",1409248114

Cron has to be one of the most difficult pieces of software to use, and it shouldn&#x27;t be. When I first heard of IFTTT, I thought it was a joke. I thought: &quot;Who needs these services when I can just spin up a VPS somewhere, write a couple of scripts and get the data I want where I need it&quot;... How silly of me. I don&#x27;t think my mother would like to take VPS Setup 101, Scripting 101 and Sysadmin 101 in order to have recipes from one website show up in her mailbox every morning.<p>IFTTT and similar products helps productive people build bridges between services they use in order to further improve their productivity. No need to pay for a VPS, manage it, develop API interfaces, etc... It all makes sense... and if they&#x27;re able to bring that simplicity to event handling in small devices, then that would be great.",1409246887

Yes, you really can have complicated multiple inheritance <i>and</i> runtime multiple dispatch in one language. It&#x27;s not even that hard to implement, if you know the right tricks.<p>- Limited integer types were a mess, particularly when it came to multiple dispatch. You don&#x27;t want two overrides of a function, one which applies to values from -1 to 7, and another which applies to values from 6 to 11. Similarly, limited collection types were supposedly used to implement typed collections, but it always felt like it was bolted on.<p>- Singletons had clean semantics but they made dispatch more expensive.<p>- Both type unions and subclass types worked quite well in practice.<p>- Dylan&#x27;s design suffered from &quot;sufficiently smart compiler syndrome&quot; in several areas. This manifested as language features which were painfully slow in the general case, but which could run quite fast in a few special cases.  This made it hard for users to build a good mental model of Dylan performance. It also meant that Dylan compilers needed to provide multiple implementations of certain features and choose between them at compile time.<p>Dylan was an exceptionally good language for its time, and I had a ton of fun using it. I keep meaning to try out Julia, which apparently inherits quite a few cool features from Dylan.",1409245226

The web, and the technologies surrounding it, emerged quickly, with bitter fights (Netscape v. Microsoft) and competing standards. Now we pay the price for that speed of innovation.<p>Fortunately, things are looking up: As the web stabilizes as a platform, and browser developers have time to pay back their code debt, applications will respond more quickly. Similarly, we&#x27;re starting to see better toolkits like React and Om, which treat the browser more as an application platform and less like a document viewer.<p>I wholeheartedly agree with the sentiment behind this post. We developed the web quickly; as the web stabilizes, so can we step back and optimize the slow parts. And we are: HTTP 2.0, Servo, WebGL, asm.js, better JavaScript engines, better rendering engines, and better applications.<p>The browser isn&#x27;t inherently a slow layer of abstraction; we just haven&#x27;t refined the technology to a point where it&#x27;s simple to create performant webpages.

The short version is that usually preferred shareholders (the investors) get paid first and will get at least their investment back and then what&#x27;s left is split among the common shareholders.  Also note that if the preferred shareholders are &quot;participating&quot; or not matters, as they may get to be common shareholders as well as preferred, meaning normal common shareholders get even less in these kinds of situations.<p>If your startup isn&#x27;t wildly successful and you&#x27;re not a founder or investor, don&#x27;t expect to have a life-changing payday.

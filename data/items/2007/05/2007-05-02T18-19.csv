And that number will show up in the decimal expansion of pi somewhere.  So clearly, text should not be copywritable either.<p>I think I need to link to ""What Colour are you bits?""

Basically, it boils down to humans' conception of reality being incorrect, so things like authorship are assumed, even though there's no unforgeable way to represent them in reality.",1178131270

18793,comment,18674,18759,0,0,nostrademons,,,"The board, however, can direct attention toward fixing the broken product.  From the article, it sounds like Friendster's board didn't do this.  Instead of focusing their attention on fixing performance problems and making the site usable, they had pie-in-the-sky notions of beating Google and Yahoo and getting into the VOIP space.<p>One of the best pieces of engineering-management advice I ever got goes like this: ""Engineers do what you tell them to do - repeatedly.""  If the board is spending all its time thinking about cool new features, the engineers will implement cool new features.  If the board starts talking about performance and communicates that downwards, the performance issues will get fixed.<p>Remember how Microsoft won the browser wars: Bill Gates took all the company's best developers, put them on the IE team, and refused to speak to anyone unless it was about the Internet.  That's the kind of single-minded focus you need to turn a company around.",1178130327

Social networks try and connect you with people you already know while dating sites try and match you with people you don't know. There was an article about how dating sites should focus on the flirting and social interaction and hopefully this gives them the motivation to change their direction.",1178130080

I tend to think that the lower the barrier to entry, the more interesting of an idea you need to be successful. Maybe the key is in specialization.",1178129821
18787,comment,18532,18576,0,0,ecuzzillo,,,"Ubuntu is highly popular, and is growing very quickly. <p>Moreover, it cares more about enabling nontechnical users (doctors, lawyers, etc) to get work done than any other distribution I've seen. Most of the advances in Ubuntu I've seen have been in the direction of making it easier and easier for people who don't know what an operating system is to be helped by Linux. (cf. Windows migration tools that automatically create a dual boot system, and crawl the Windows partition to find bookmarks, email contacts, etc). <p>As such, I think it's the most suitable distribution for a mainstream vendor to adopt for sale to mainstream users.

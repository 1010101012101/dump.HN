A third party reversed how Amazon authenticated its movies and for a day, you could actually cast the movies that your Prime subscription allowed, including rentals. It was no different than if you authenticated on the website. Amazon quickly scrambled to shut that app down and still hasn&#x27;t answered with their own method for Chromecast. It isn&#x27;t even a technical issue, it is a control issue.<p>Now I don&#x27;t know the licensing terms they have with the content providers, but they certainly aren&#x27;t fulfilling the consumer demand.",1443772675

Technological tools can take care of &quot;low-hanging&quot; fruit, but can&#x27;t be so strict as to prevent flexibility when needed.<p>I like this story in that it&#x27;s a bit of coworkers policing themselves a bit. We have a similar situation in my workplace, where smartcard authentication is used. We&#x27;re all taught to pull our cards when we get up from our desks, and this is followed pretty well. The odd email has gone out under someone else&#x27;s name (usually with accompanying embarrassing text) but more often than not, we&#x27;ll simply pull that person&#x27;s card, hold onto it, and then enjoy the few minutes of panic as they try to determine if they lost it or not. Both the customer and the security officer are none too pleased when cards go missing, so it serves as a good reminder.<p>Long story short, watch and remind one another frequently of good security practices, and encourage others to as well. You may think you&#x27;re being a jerk at first, but as more catch on and not only adhere, but help encourage those rules, it&#x27;ll be less uncool to call them out and more uncool to deviate from them.",1443772645

Officially or unofficially.  For example saudi arabia and dubai have %0 income tax for example. Not great places to live permanently for other reasons, but they exist.  I don&#x27;t think they will let go of their %0 income tax rates any time soon either.<p>Panama and the HK only tax Panama and HK source income.  They are far nicer places to live.  This tax nature is unlikely to change any time soon.<p>Switzerland has no capital gains tax on share sales.  The UK has a horrible tax law called non-domiciled resident that has created the housing affordability apocalypse of london. The wealthy can just pay a flat tax of 30k pounds per year after 7 years of the status.

But it seems to me that in this case, Apple is providing opportunities that many people are choosing them for themselves, opportunities that they would otherwise not have. And for the crime of not providing even better opportunities, Apple is being characterized as exploitative. That seems unreasonable and unfair.<p>> I&#x27;d like to read interviews of people who worked there to see if the job was what they were expecting, worse, or better.<p>I would too. From what I know, it&#x27;s complicated, and contrary to what a lot of people would expect. For example, there really has been massive discontent at Foxconn, etc. -- because they weren&#x27;t given as much overtime as promised.<p>Do I wish that people had better opportunities? So, so dearly. This is probably the deepest emotion/feeling I have in my life, the sense of how fortunate I have been compared to how difficult the lives of others have been, when many of them are just as smart, just as hardworking and resourceful as I am, but were simply born in circumstances that did not grant them as much opportunity as I have enjoyed. This is a big part of why I am in China and why I study Mandarin.<p>But saying Tim Cook earns &quot;too much&quot;, or that factory workers are &quot;exploited&quot; because they make choices that we wouldn&#x27;t, were we to be magically swapped into their bodies, but with our abilities, or some other imaginary situation that has never existed, is not very understanding of the situation, or fair or productive.<p>The key, I think, is to realize that if you were the &quot;exploited&quot; workers, you would make the same choices. Really. If you were them, you would do the same thing. Then I think it&#x27;s more clear that Apple is providing avenues toward better lives, which I see as a very good thing.",1443771812

But do I want relevant ads, yes, although I would also like this to be interspersed with other relevant things. If an engine could determine that the most relevant thing for me at the moment is something educational on a subject then it should give me this, if an ad it should give me an ad.<p>As an example I recently bought a rabbit for my daughter, there&#x27;s a bunch of relevant information on rabbits I need to know about, as well as things it would be useful for me to buy. In order for me to determine what I need to buy I need to do research to determine what is the best solution for my needs at the moment. Really relevant ads would give me a very close match to what I need, and explain to me why I needed it. Trusting the relevant ad vendor I would not have to spend time on research and could go directly to purchase.

Extremely, extremely helpful to get the structure of a file at a glance. For example, if a 400-line file has about 10 functions in it, you can fold all &quot;zM&quot; and instantly you see only the function signatures, while the bodies are folded.<p>How to enable it: use &quot;set foldmethod=syntax&quot; (with C++) or &quot;set foldmethod=indent&quot; (with JS, where &quot;syntax&quot; doesn&#x27;t work for me). Also, I use &quot;set foldminlines=0&quot; so that 1-line paragraphs get closed as well (it looks more consistent).<p>How to use it: close all folds &quot;zM&quot; (I remember it because the M is shaped like it&#x27;s all folded on itself). Open all folds &quot;zR&quot;. Open one fold &quot;zo&quot;, close one fold &quot;zc&quot;.

   languages that I mentioned do. So it seems that you agree with
   the the church of lambda on this point?
</code></pre>
No, Eff starts with a pure lambda calculus and adds effects on
top.<p><pre><code>   I&#x27;ve explained several times that the assumption that you need
   to do full on verification from the start with a CH style
   system is incorrect. You can write your prototype without any
   verification and add lemmas and theorems about it when the
   spec stabilizes.
</code></pre>
As I said, I don&#x27;t really see that. There is research going on,
like the aforementioned Trelly that seeks to build such systems,
but they are not there yet.<p><pre><code>   Well yes, you also need &quot;well typed programs don&#x27;t go wrong&quot;
   of course, which dependent type systems do have.
</code></pre>
Well typed programs do go wrong! Here is a well-typed Ocaml program:<p><pre><code>    List.hd [];;
</code></pre>
When I run it, an exception is thrown. The point is: what counts
as &quot;not going wrong&quot; is a fairly arbitrary definition. And for
the trivial typing system I can define programs that go wrong as
the empty set.<p><pre><code>   I don&#x27;t think decidability of type checking is desirable, by
   the way. What you really want is a system that checks
   statically as much as possible, but can check dynamically that
   which it can&#x27;t verify statically. Rather than two
   possibilities &quot;correct&quot; vs &quot;incorrect&quot; you want
   three: &quot;definitely correct&quot;, &quot;definitely incorrect&quot; and &quot;can&#x27;t
   determine statically, so let&#x27;s check dynamically&quot;. In the last
   case conventional systems just reject the program as
   incorrect, but I think that is not as helpful.
</code></pre>
I don&#x27;t think this will be useful, because than every typo will
turn into a dynamic check, and you end up with a dynamically
typed language for all practical purposes. I think<p><pre><code>   More open than a program logic system that does the same?
</code></pre>
Yes, vastly more open. Those problems are essentially solved for
program logics.<p><pre><code>   I don&#x27;t think the approaches are that different in this
   regard. With state/concurrency/etc you work with a description
   of the computation
</code></pre>
Yes, you can work by encoding, but then you pay the &quot;encoding
tax&quot; in verification.<p><pre><code>   The dynamic checks are for when type checking fails, not type
   inference. The type inference will always infer the type if the
   term is typeable.
</code></pre>
That&#x27;s not how I understand the Sage paper [1], which says: &quot;Our
implementation performs bidirectional type checking (Pierce and Turner
1998), allowing many types to be inferred locally, but does not yet
perform full type inference (a much more technically challenging
problem).&quot;<p><pre><code>   That paper itself says so in the first sentence?
</code></pre>
But the paper also presents a complete inference algorithm for
GADTs.  The point is: it depends on exactly what you mean by
GADTs. I don&#x27;t know what Ocaml does here. I stopped using Ocaml
just before GADTs were added.<p>[1] <a href=""https://sage.soe.ucsc.edu/sage-tr.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://sage.soe.ucsc.edu/sage-tr.pdf</a>",1443769598

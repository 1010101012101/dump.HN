Being out of country makes the fraud likelihood even higher. With paypal or mastercard payments, merchants have no protection because of chargebacks.<p>Basically, after a fraud/non delivery/stolen CC allegation CC companies and paypal will pull that money from the merchant's account and fully refund the customer pretty much immediately and without question. It's usually impossible or impractical to reverse that once it has happened, regardless of what evidence you have. Police will not investigate and the CC company won't hear your case.<p>I have had a client that personally delivered and item and got a signature. When the chargeback claim came (non delivery), he recorded a phone conversation with the recipient where she admitted (she was ""tricked"") to the fraud. The police told him (after a lot of badgering) that they get about 100X as many claims as they can investigate.

Now Hyundai is becoming more and more popular and is getting the credit they deserve.  Vizio is similar.  As a new player, it seems they just decided to make great products at affordable prices.

If there wasn't, they would have cut the price already since it takes almost no effort to do so.  People pay for the perceived value of the product, not the value of the underlying costs plus some margin.<p>Pricing based on cost is irrelevant because that has nothing to do with the value created or what people are willing to pay.  E.g., why did Sony and MS sell the PS3 and 360 below cost for so long?  Well, no one would have paid the $1000 plus margin that Sony would have needed.<p>On the other end, do you really think that bottle of Coke you buy is priced anywhere based on the cost of manufacturing?  The ingredients in that cost about $0.02, but they charge $1 at the store.  The 20oz bottle has maybe an extra couple cents of cost, but they charge twice as much.<p>To your point, Ask could have 5% share of volume, but if their ad platform was better to the point that they could charge 10x what Google could, they would be doing pretty well.",1297650330

Perhaps you are not a native english speaker, but your statement is very easy to read as implying that only those who cannot do [what? research? engineering?] teach, and only those who are lousy teachers get tenure.<p>It is an indefensible position and your obvious hostility towards modern academia is unjustified.

I think this notion is very much overblown. In modern times you cannot even get tenure before you are 35 or 40. If you look at those with tenure, the majority continue to do good work for the remainder of their careers.  That aside, the main purpose of tenure is actually to protect the pursuit of knowledge. It exists to prevent management from dictating what people may research. It is to allow researchers to pursue risky or unpopular approaches.<p>Academics do what they do because they primarily enjoy research.

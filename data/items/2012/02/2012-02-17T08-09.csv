Essentially, jewish law differentiates between direct and indirect responses to actions.  And I can verify you'll occasionally see this stuff on the UES, and a little more often in the Hasidic bits of Brooklyn.<p><pre><code>   Sabbath law prohibits Jews from performing actions that cause a direct reaction;
   that would qualify as forbidden work. But indirect reactions are, well, kosher. In
   Hebrew, this concept is called the gramma. There are two types of grammas,
   Ottensoser tells me. Say you hit a light switch, but it doesn't come on
   immediately - that's a time delay, a time gramma. There's also a gramma of
   mechanical indirectness, like a Rube Goldberg contraption in which a mouse turns a
   wheel that swings a hammer that turns a key that launches a rocket. You can't
   claim the mouse actually launches the rocket.

Yes you ""only"" have some videos, but you also have views of said videos, and comments and rankings. Building different views of videos based on those factors is hard if you have lots and lots of this data points. Not to mention that you then have to (somewhere) display just some user's videos sorted by how they ware ranked, or maybe just some user's videos from some category based on number of views (which is not a simple INT field in the db).

I can accept feeling a bit lost at first, because everything is moved around...it's a redesign. However, there is no clear grid. Not every site should follow grid principles, but a site like this probably should. White space padding is not uniform and there are a few arbitrary blocks of white space for no good reason. Even if this is a work in progress and they fill those blocks with ads or something else, there is still no grid and I think this oversight causes the disjointed feeling.<p>Here's another newsy site that does follow a grid and it's a lot easier to scan information: <a href=""http://www.guardiannews.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.guardiannews.com/</a>",1329466508

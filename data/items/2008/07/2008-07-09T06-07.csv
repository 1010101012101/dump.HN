The primary goal is to defuse the situation and avoid seeming hostile or egocentric.</i><p>That makes a lot of sense and is really helpful. Hostile and egocentric (or at least defensive) are pretty much how he did come across. Plus incongruent (saying how amused he was when he obviously wasn't, and so on).<p>There's a huge culture gap between the supercilious Apple snobs, whose haughtiness is a composite of everything bad ever said about Mac users, and the earnest outsider trying to justify himself and not realizing that he's only making things worse. For example, he mentions his years of experience and how many people use his data-entry apps, things that carry credibility in his culture but are just the sort of uncool things that are disdained in theirs. The whole thread is full of these crossed signals.",1215586677

Unintentionally, I have postured myself as an ""Expert"" within the CodeIgniter community. Frequent posts on the forums, a geniune desire to help people and promote the community, and an active blog in which the community participates are all contributing factors to this status.<p>Clients come to me for work and all of my clients have come to me for repeat work after the fact. I give them my hourly rate, which is lower than most US-based coders but significantly hire than offshore, and an estimate of the total hours their project will require.<p>They either take it or leave it - no bidding and worrying about whether I'm going to pick that client up. There's a long line of potential clients behind him if he turns the offer down.<p>I guess the mentality is a bit different, in the way I freelance. Not to sound prudent, but I envision the relationship as the client competing for me, not I competing for the client. I don't need the money, it's a nicety - if the project doesn't interest me, the client seems like an idiot, or I'm just to busy, I can turn it down with no worries.",1215586483

The ""secret"" is to use the RSS features of Craigslist and run multiple search feeds in an RSS reader like NetNewsWire that lets you sort and mark them... I run searches like ""CSS"" ""UI design"" etc.. Run those same searches all over the country for your area of expertise. Have a kick ass portfolio online, solid references, and send out emails everyday to answer the quality ads... and rock the initial interviews...

Now since everyone's talking about elance and odesk, they must be crowded too.<p>Now I need a few dollars to bootstrap my startup.
So I started looking for mashup and web development contests. Ofcourse, you make money only if you win. But if you are dedicated you will win.

(if anyone knows more just pour them in)<p>If you have chosen to do freelance work as your mainstream profession and looking for your first set of clients, then why don't build a portfolio first? Build an  app that helps your kid brother in his geometry homework or build a webapp that does event management for locality... Just build anything to show-off your skills. And then show people your work, so when they look at your work, they 'must' feel that they have found a guy who can do it (you proved it with samples).<p>I have a question too. Does anyone know any agencies that deal with outsourcing freelance work? What are these agencies called?",1215584075

The Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006 would make paying with credit cards nearly impossible since this would clearly be defined as illegal gambling (a game whose outcome is dictated by chance). Especially because you are dealing with physical goods/services that have to be delivered on US soil, this bill makes this business model nearly impossible to do.<p>In addition, because you are dealing with physical goods, you are leaving the winner with a tax burden (that can't be paid by a portion of the winnings when dealing with non-cash). So that Ferrari F430 Spider becomes a $30,000 tax bill. So long as the winnings are taxed, a bettor's expected value will always be diminished significantly.",1215583365

You have this product, OneDrive, and one of the purposes is backing up all your photos and video, especially from mobile phones. The marketshare of Windows Phone, the only OS that includes OneDrive tightly integrated, is irrelevant compared to Android and iOS. And these two don&#x27;t include OneDrive; you have to entice Android and iOS users to download and use the OneDrive app by offering something more than the built-in apps. So what&#x27;s Microsoft answer to this? Make OneDrive worse than iCloud! Imagine how OneDrive is going to look if Apple next year decides to upgrade the free-tier iCloud space.<p>And downgrading the space for existing users is another terrible move. Good luck telling your users to actually <i>delete</i> photos and documents (not all users are tech-savvy enough to move data between services).<p>I understand giving things for free is bad for business, but this move is the worst possible response.

While there are undoubtedly occasions when newer systems do bring vast improvements, there are also occasions when newer systems are just trying to reinvent the wheel and ultimately end up little better - or sometimes even worse - than the old system (and that&#x27;s before you factor in training your staff to use the new systems). There are also occasions when the newer system is trying to change a process in ways that meet modern fashions yet fail to meet a company&#x27;s core business requirements.  Both of the last two points are things I&#x27;ve unfortunately seen a few times in previous jobs.<p>There are generally three points that need to be considered before upgrading an older system:<p>1. Is the older system still fulfilling the needs? (often jobs change over time and some systems are rigid thus require users to perform additional steps in the modern era to continue to make use of the older system).<p>2. Is support still available for the older system (eg if it breaks, is hardware available to replace it? Are engineers still available to maintain it? etc)<p>3. Will the new proposed system fix the aforementioned issues?<p>Often you&#x27;ll find that the first two points are still or that the 3rd point isn&#x27;t true. Sadly it&#x27;s all too common that the reason someone pushes to upgrade older systems is either down to agism (&quot;it&#x27;s old. Old is bad!&quot;) or because someone needs to justify their own job / bulk out their CV (&quot;I was responsible for migrating Company xyz from product a to product b.&quot;).<p>With the greatest of respect to yourself, as you get older I think you too will start to notice just how often upgrades go wrong and how some businesses would have been better off sticking with the old system. So there does need to be a carefully considered pragmatism with regards to just how robust some older systems can be and whether the upgrade is actually offering any benefit or whether the older system is genuinely just bad / no longer fulfilling the job requirements.",1446551001

I love learning and consuming protocols but I am hoping to become a frontend developer if I can get my feet wet. I am looking for experience and networking opportunities. I would be happy to even move into a position where I&#x27;m maintaining something (again, to gain experience with the industry). I have been through the introductory tutorials for Angular, Backbone, Ember, Meteor, and React. I feel capable but not wise about how to use these frameworks. I consider myself not an expert but someone who has a good &#x27;depth&#x27; of knowledge covering a broad area. I feel like this aids me when figuring out a tough problem as I look outside my comfort zone to find a solution.<p>I would work for any company except Amazon.  I have been through the interview loop twice for entry-level positions and while everyone I met seemed to like me, I was turned down at the last minute both times for unknown reasons.  The speech on door-tables is just ridiculous, not inspiring.  HR at Amazon is kinda scary...  I was interviewed in a dimly lit cave of an office.  I still don&#x27;t understand why in a warehouse with 4000 people I saw nobody using ear protection.  Lots of loose clothing around machinery too.  Lots of strange vibes.<p>(PS: I can be reached on Freenode as &#x27;Sleepy_Coder&#x27; - but email is preferred for an introduction)",1446550425

With enough local access to a grey market, trafficking across international borders vanished.<p>The economics involved here involve the difference between the cost of something, the value of something, the difficulty of producing it, and the difficulty of distributing it. What is unique about marijuana is that it is, indeed, as easy to produce as a tomato, which is a garden vegetable anyone can grow easily anywhere in the world. (I&#x27;m unaware of any jurisdictions where it is illegal to grow and consume tomatoes. Transporting them across state lines, though?)<p>Plants like tobacco are much more climate restricted. Plants like hops are incredibly easy to grow. So you see plenty of people brewing their own beer at home, but nobody making their own cigarettes at home.<p>You&#x27;re misunderstanding what I&#x27;m saying about changes at the federal level, though. The warehouse space in Denver county is rapidly filling up purely based on supply and demand <i>within Colorado</i>. Sure, there&#x27;s some tourism, but  If the DEA rescheduled cannabis and <i>nothing else</i>, then almost nothing would change about the commercial real estate market in Denver. If nothing changes at the federal level, then almost nothing would change about the commercial real estate market in Denver.<p>Also, this <i>just</i> happend: <a href=""http://fox40.com/2015/11/02/ballot-initiative-filed-to-legalize-marijuana-in-california/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fox40.com/2015/11/02/ballot-initiative-filed-to-legal...</a><p>I was unaware of this until I decided to research it just now, because I don&#x27;t really care about this issue in California because I don&#x27;t live there. I was responding to the original commenter because it really is unsafe to hike in Humboldt County, regardless of whether you care about marijuana. This is something that affects the poster directly.<p>And I&#x27;m not saying I want to repeal the law in Colorado, but it&#x27;s definitely having an unexpected negative effect on my neighborhood, and this is unlikely to change. Whatever industrial / warehouse space that isn&#x27;t being demolished to turn into condos, is used up by the <i>regulated</i> marijuana industry. There is no longer any cheap real estate anywhere near me that is suitable for a hackerspace.<p>Since the hackerspaces can move, and the marijuana processing facilities can&#x27;t (until the laws change at the county level), this affects me in my backyard, regardless of how they deal with the practical legislative refinements. And because Colorado regulators were first out the gate, regulators in almost every other state that moves forward this way will use that as a model.<p>I&#x27;m not saying we shouldn&#x27;t care about violence in Mexico, but it&#x27;s just not something that&#x27;s going to be on the mind of most voters as these ballot measures gain momentum in other states.

OneDrive is a complementary service to Office, much like everything else that Microsoft does, which is why it will never be their focus. OneDrive is not the product being sold, but rather the candy that users receive to entice them into an Office365 subscription. This simple fact of microeconomics has also been visible in the feature set provided. For example out of the solutions I tried, OneDrive is the only one that does not offer features for auditing what happened with your files, as in a log of what happened lately, or versioning of changes - those being features probably reserved for OneDrive for Business, because you know, only businesses care about their data.<p>And OneDrive is not alone in this. Google Drive and iCloud are also complementary services. I mean, for now you can clearly see who is treating cloud storage seriously by the support they give to their Linux customers. And if you want to vote with your wallets for complementaries, that&#x27;s fine, but it reduces choice in the marketplace and I think that personal data (think photos, videos, personal projects) is too important to treat with a shitty, complementary free tier whose purpose is to lock you into something.",1446548536

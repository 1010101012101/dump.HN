2709746,comment,2709539,2709539,8,0,samdk,,,"1. I think you're wrong. I would agree that JavaScript's syntax is not great, but it's still better than Java's. (And dynamic typing, whatever your complaints with it, does significantly reduce how verbose the language is.) Also, first-class functions are a <i>huge</i> benefit for me.<p>Also a lot of JS's syntactical issues/verbosity can be alleviated with libraries like Underscore. Start using CoffeeScript and you're miles ahead of Java in terms of syntax and verbosity, and you make some of JS's more annoying issues a lot easier to avoid.<p>2. Yes, you do care about performance, to a certain point. If everything I was doing had to immediately be available at Google scale, then yes, I'd consider Java a lot more seriously. However, most of the stuff I do doesn't have to scale to millions of simultaneous connections on just a handful of servers. Absolute performance is not my highest consideration, and NodeJS absolutely is more productive for me than Java.<p>I think you're missing a couple of very important points, which are why I think NodeJS is the best tool for some tasks.<p>First, and by far most importantly, it has Socket.IO, which is by far the best choice library when you're doing anything in real time. It is fantastic, and is a huge part of the reason why I use NodeJS for certain classes of applications.<p>Second, there <i>is</i> value to being able to share code between the server and the client for nontrivial web applications. Most code doesn't get shared, but not having to have separately maintained models for the server and client is really helpful.<p>For me, the 'cool factor' doesn't come into it at all. I enjoy programming in JS and even moreso in CoffeeScript. I dislike programming in Java. And when I'm not doing something that has to be hugely scalable, Java's only real advantage is raw speed, and NodeJS has vastly superior tools for doing what I'm trying to do (real-time webapps), NodeJS is the clear choice.",1309360400

Currently, Javascript has a much more interesting ecosystem than it has at any other time. Just as Rails took many collective practices and managed to communicate them clearly to a huge group of developers, I think a similar trend is happening in Javascript. From this perspective, Node.js is appealing because it rides atop this Javascript revolution with tools like Coffeescript, Backbone, etc.<p>Outside of the language decision, I think people are choosing to use Node.js b/c of its programming model. There are many applications that are relatively easy to code for when you can assume a constant connection between two processes. Where Node.js seems to excel is in these service level, socket based servers that may or may not have a web component. Likewise, Node.js also aims to be very <i>nix friendly in that it tries to use simple processes for scaling instead of relying on more complicated application / language specific tools. This adherence to </i>nix patterns is also very advantageous to some people.<p>Finally, as people start finding use cases where async really is a good idea, Node.js ends up being a decent option. Having done some async programming in Python, it is very difficult because the async assumption needs to be made throughout in order to avoid blocking. My impression is that the experience in other languages is similar, where no library is truly able to make the async paradigm seamless. Node.js has been written from scratch to support this model and many developers understand it via their Javascript experience. It therefore can be a good option when compared to including something like Stackless, EventMachine, etc. in their applications.<p>I think the key point here is that Node.js has managed to hit something of a sweet spot in that it is async, uses a language that is having something of a renaissance and uses *nix to make its integration obvious.<p>Again, I don't use Node.js very heavily at all, but that is my impression as to why people would choose it over other technologies.",1309360245

What shall we do?"" might not be the right question. ""Why did anyone ever do so in the first place?"" might be closer.<p>I've heard the reason described as such:<p>""People will pay the highest possible amount they can afford for things like doctors and lawyers because if there is a screw up they die or go to jail.<p>When the stakes are so high you pay the most you possibly can to ensure, to the best of  your ability, the best possible outcome for yourself.""<p>Atleast this line of thinking makes sense to me.  If I'm ever up on trial for something that could send me to jail, you can bet I'll spend every penny I have to ensure that I'm found innocent.",1309359904

2709708,comment,2709539,2709539,2,0,Meai,,,"Well this is not an answer any single person can or should want to give you, but I'll try to summarize the big picture anyway:<p>1. Nodejs is really well documented code. This is very rare, and much more so in the Javascript world.<p>2. It has a nice, easy to use package manager. In comparison, I have a hard time containing my boiling rage over Maven...<p>3. Nodejs was marketed as very fast. Although async+fast solutions exist with other languages and frameworks too, they require you to be very knowledgable in those areas. Nodejs is a no-brainer. They practically guaranteed you that you are not going to get bad performance, because in Javascript you can't use blocking calls. Nodejs users care about performance. Java programmers tell you to not worry about it. (attention: gross generalization)<p>4. Javascript programmers don't know about better solutions. In fact, I'd say that most of the PHP crowd doesn't know better solutions either. There's your huge market.<p>5. Javascript is easy to program in. You can have your <i>production</i> server up and running with a few lines of code. I believe an experienced Java programmer when he says that the LOC (lines of code) are not much more with Java. But you do need to learn a lot more to get to that point. Nodejs is self-contained.<p>Personally, I do not want to program large projects in a dynamic language. I still made a small prototype in Nodejs before moving on though. It's too messy for me :)",1309359777

I wouldn't make that statement with Ruby for example, but I've done lots of all 3.<p>It depends on what you are writing. But personally, I find that languages with first class functions are much more powerful than languages without. Closures fall out of this as well. So on that point, JavaScript stomps all over Java.<p>From the anecdotal evidence of all the infrastructure the Node community has created, I'd say the FFI must be substantially better as well. I've coded in JNI and it was not fun. There's a lot of good code already out there that doesn't run inside a JVM, and to many, it's pretty important to be able to access that.",1309359676

8575716,comment,8574184,8575444,0,0,_bpo,,,"A big problem in large-scale systems is dependency management. One of the significant decisions that Go makes in its design is its approach to package management. Its approach isn&#x27;t perfect, but is simple, making it a breath of fresh air compared to C++ or JVM-based languages... e.g. how many hours have been spent tweaking Maven or debugging discrepancies between classpaths referencing different copies of commons-logging?<p>Speaking of Maven - `go build` normalizes build systems so there is less time twiddling builds. It&#x27;s not a silver bullet, but it&#x27;s specifically intended for large systems.<p>Go&#x27;s strong decisions around formatting (`go fmt`) are another example of planning for enterprise-size. There is no need for a style guide for go programs - it&#x27;s built into the language, and with an approach that feels less pedantic than Python.<p>Go isn&#x27;t perfect, but it&#x27;s certainly designed for large-scale systems.<p>I agree with you that the JVM languages have better large-scale system support currently (20 years does give you something) -- but Go&#x27;s goal is not dissimilar to the one Java eventually settled on after the applet craze.<p>Contrary to what you&#x27;ve seen, Go seems (to me) to be a go-to language for new companies principally concerned with distributed systems / cloud infrastructure (particularly those that once might have hired a hybrid of C and scripting language devs). One of the trends in those communities is toward microservices / SOA / etc, but the total codebases managed are certainly enterprise-scale.<p>All that said I have absolutely no significant opinions on Go vs Rust :) Just had to take issue with the &quot;go is not enterprise scale&quot; idea.",1415411657

If somebody were to go through the process of actually trying to implement a generic map function in the current Go they would get a good sense of just what the issues are.  Unfortunately you need a good grasp of the type system and this just isn&#x27;t something most of the commenters on this subject have; the Go community is much more qualified.  I&#x27;ve done this and generics are the first road block but after consigning to working around that you run into a lot of Go implementation details around interface{} and type assertion so that what you end up with is actually quite verbose in practise and no more desirable than the alternative.. I decided that for me, for loops aren&#x27;t so bad.<p>So it does just come back around to generics but people are solving this with code generation, like gen which looks very interesting, and I imagine that is quite acceptable for the time being, for those who really want it.",1415411450

I work mainly with web designers and the median engineer I meet typically works at a 5-50 person company, often a startup. Also small places tend to be more progressive than megacorps in some ways (e.g. not expecting lifetime employment, Saturdays off, etc.). But most of the article (company as family, etc.) applies equally to small companies.<p>Also as an aside, there&#x27;s plenty of modern cutting edge web design here!

I appreciate that suggestion, we&#x27;ll do that, not just here, because we&#x27;re already arranging meters for Norway, Maine, New Mexico, and Florida. So we&#x27;ll do that in each location. And you know one that makes it quite clear that the numbers are that bad Mick, and again, your suggestion is a good one and we will follow that up. The bark in the pacific Northwest is literally being fried off the trees. Completely fried off to the core wood. Trees are dying everywhere up here. It takes a tremendous amount of UV to do that. Nothing grows here, which is a known consequence of excessive UV. I mean the UV seems so staggeringly high that leaves are literally falling off the trees right now. They started falling off in July. So, we see every single sign of excessive UV. Massive insect decline. We just had a US forest service biologist re-survey the terrestrial insects - 90% decline. Bark being burned off the trees. You can&#x27;t stand in the sun here. So we believe those numbers. We are actually trying to use conservative math, because if you take the UVA and if you calculate 5% of the UVA measured in milliwatts per centimeter squared, you would come out with 3.5, and if you divide that into ten, which is UVB you&#x27;d get a number that&#x27;s close to 3000%.",1415411423

You make decisions that benefit you in time. That means you consider whether an action benefits you <i>at point X in the future</i>. There are extreme examples, like giving a kid all the candy he&#x27;ll get for a week and letting him divide it up. On the other end of the spectrum we have the Sagrada Familia. The people voting to have it built would never see any part of it. Their grandchildren wouldn&#x27;t see more than a tiny bit. Their grandchildren&#x27;s grandchildren would not see it. And so on.<p>Now these aren&#x27;t &quot;pure&quot; examples. The kid is not going to eat all the candy right then and there, and building the Sagrada Familia had economic advantages when it was being built, and even today.<p>But if you consider most crimes at a time horizon of a day or two. They make sense, suddenly they become rational actions. HSBC and Jamie Dimon made decisions that would benefit them for years at least, and then lead to disaster.

Your feedback on polyfill.io is accurate, but out of date.  I know you were very active in working with Jonathan on his original service, and I&#x27;d be delighted to talk to you about how we can work together.<p>I&#x27;d also make a few points of feedback on your solution:<p>1. It&#x27;s confusing to name your service with a name that is only one character different than ours.  Some might interpret that the confusion is your intention, which I&#x27;m sure it isn&#x27;t - would you consider renaming it?  We&#x27;ve already seen confusion happen around polyfill.io (which is still the old service for compatibility reasons) and cdn.polyfill.io.<p>2. Granted, Jonathan&#x27;s original polyfill.io had no tests.  But that&#x27;s one of the things we&#x27;ve spent a lot of time fixing, and our test framework is now extremely good.  You&#x27;re testing using naive feature-detects, while we have relatively comprehensive test suites for many features and are adding more all the time.<p>3. Your targeting of browsers is based on data gathered from crowdsourced sources like caniuse and MDN, whereas we establish compatibility through testing our polyfills in every browser using an automated CI-driven process on Sauce Labs.<p>4. We are now starting to incorporate other people&#x27;s polyfills where they are better than ours, and have a mechanism to do that, and to store and serve the appropriate attribution and licence information.  We&#x27;ve actually considered many of the polyfills that you have made part of your service.<p>5. We&#x27;ve had discussions with several of the authors of the popular polyfills you&#x27;ve included, and their main concern over the way we were considering including their code was that we copied it into our repo rather than linking their repo as a dependency.  You&#x27;re doing that too, and including more third-party code than we have so far.  It&#x27;s totally legit within the licences they&#x27;ve granted and it&#x27;s a policy we&#x27;ll probably continue to follow too, but we&#x27;re still thinking on how we can do this in a way that keeps everyone happy.

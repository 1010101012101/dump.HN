We just ask questions.<p>We would not have guessed you could pick startups in 10 minutes either, at first.  We realized this when interviews used to be longer.  We noticed that we usually knew after 10 minutes whether we wanted to fund a group, and that in cases where we didn't we used to just have to sit there talking for another 10 or 20 minutes even though we'd already made up our minds.  <p>I'm not saying we're always right; far from it; but more time would make surprisingly little difference.",1194663323

No one deserves to be called names for giving away $28 million.<p>This seems to me the meanest (in both senses) comment I've seen on News.YC to date.  Ending it with an ass-covering ""Just my 2c"" just makes it seem that much more contemptible.",1194662085

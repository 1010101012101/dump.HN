If you like outdoorsy stuff, hiking, woodlands, and rolling fields, Amherst is for you.  If you want a bustling social scene and lots of people with common interests, stick to Boston.  There are a couple of nice coffeeshops & bars in both Amherst and Northampton, but these are towns with a population of 7000 vs. 600,000 for Boston.<p>Personally, I can't stand living without some green in my life, so I loved Amherst.  But I was in college, and it's rare that college students lack a social life.  I have friends who stayed behind after graduation and some of them complained about being bored (though one of them ended up in Vermont instead, go figure).",1194101612

For your average single male in his 20's early 30's, other than the possibility of getting rich, being a cube drone in a city populated by (mostly male) cube drones is not an attractive prospect. It is very close to my definition of hell.",1194099865

It is pretty embarrassing to mix up fundamental literary devices in a writing analysis, which reaches the single conclusion that you simply ought to not make writing mistakes.<p>( <a href=""http://members.ozemail.com.au/~ddiamond/analog.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://members.ozemail.com.au/~ddiamond/analog.html</a> )",1194099811

When we are truly inspired, in the 'flow' if you like, doesn't that feel like the easiest, most natural state you have ever experienced?  <p>Ptn nails it in his comment - ""they left out the inner spark"".  Absolutely.  Genius is simply the release of the inner spark  and that process is not something that could be characterised by effort. <p>Here's an alternative perspective -\n<a href=""http://www.life2point0.com/2007/02/learning_to_fly.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.life2point0.com/2007/02/learning_to_fly.html</a> and   \n<a href=""http://www.life2point0.com/2006/06/the_little_book.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.life2point0.com/2006/06/the_little_book.html</a>",1194099250

It speaks to a new, disturbing dynamic in our social order where people do not defend their beliefs with any sort of force or passion.<p>I had no clue so many people shared in my belief that Snowden has done something great. I figured the media had corrupted most of the people into thinking he&#x27;d done something deplorable, because no one has been taking to the streets or to the polls or to the anything to demand changes based on his revelations.<p>Past generations would have, but that&#x27;s not the case today. We think he&#x27;s great. We just don&#x27;t care to actually support him.<p>Historically, I feel like there was a notion that someone was &quot;too popular to execute.&quot; But, even though the vast majority appear to support Snowden so much that they declare him POY, I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;d do a thing if the US raided his home in Russia and put a bullet in him. We&#x27;d be mad, and we&#x27;d write blog posts about it, and maybe some people would DDoS attack a website or send a bunch of pizzas to John Kerry, but there would be no political turnover. There would be no justice on Snowden&#x27;s behalf. At best, it would be like Guantanamo, where some new POTUS candidate promises change so we elect him, then does absolutely nothing. And we&#x27;d happily just not care.",1385474370

It seems Americans today are afraid of more things than ever: pedophiles, guns, terrorists, lawsuits. Some news reports are ridiculous by foreign standards: teachers not being allowed to shake hands with students out of fear of sexual harassment allegations, boys suspended from school for drawing guns, bystanders not administering first-aid to accident victims out of fear of lawsuits, and of course the terrorism hysteria for which I have no words. I&#x27;m fortunate enough to have visited the US and have met mostly great people, but going by news reports the entire society seems paralyzed by fear.<p>I always thought of freedom as inversely proportional to safety. If you want to be perfectly safe, you&#x27;ll never leave your house in case you catch a germ, get in a car accident or even slip on a banana peel. You&#x27;ll never eat store bought food without first running it through a spectrometer.

So a 2.2ghash miner (e.g. Blue/Red Fury from BPM) will generate 0.1BTC over 6 months. That miner would cost you approx $280. That would buy you 0.35BTC at a price of $800 per BTC.<p>There is obviously a point at which these would be economical to buy but that price point is less than $80, which is just over a quarter of their current price and that is probably close to what the manufacturer is paying for the production of them (including chip costs etc).<p>Source - I resell a lot of mining equipment on ebay, I charge approx 2 - 3 times what I pay for the units in bitcoin and i sell out of stock usually within 48-96 hours.<p>Now it may be that obtaining bitcoins is more difficult that obtaining mining equipment, or the fact that you can buy them on ebay (a site people are familiar with) as opposed to a site like localbitcoins (where people are not familiar with it and it requries sending money direct from your bank account) means people prefer to buy miners instead of BTC. The argument that coins will be worth more does not factor in as you can buy more coins now whoch will also be worth more.<p>Final point I would make on this is that mining has not been a profitable endeavour for most of bitcoins history. Anyone who mined from 2009 to late 2010/early 2011 will probably have done so at a loss, based ont he understanding that coins would be worth more later on down the road.

As the book points out, introversion and extroversion can be determined very early in life, she mentions a study where infants who were more reactive to stimulus turned out to be introverts and infants who were chill turned out to be extroverts:<p>-------<p>“The four-month-olds who thrashed their arms like punk rockers did so not because they were extroverts in the making, but because their little bodies reacted strongly—they were “high-reactive”—to new sights, sounds, and smells,” Cain writes. “The quiet infants were silent not because they were future introverts—just the opposite—but because they had nervous systems that were unmoved by novelty.” These “high-reactive” babies grow up to be children who need a lot of time to decompress after school, need time alone to be creative and explore.

Converting existing code from i.e. Matlab to accelerator hardware is trivial using these libraries and you get excellent performance quickly. Furthermore, NT2 doesn&#x27;t get nearly as much publicity as it deserves [3]. Not only does it provide an incredible number of functions ready to use, but it also exploits the vector processing capabilities of modern CPUs. These capabilities are too often ignored by developers or left for non-optimal compiler optimizations to exploit.<p>In my own library Aura, I focus on maximizing performance (over developer convenience). The target audience are developers of real-time applications that need every last drop of performance from their hardware, while still maintaining a sane and cross-platform API. I strive for a Boost.Asio for accelerator developers. Aura has a already a rudimentary wrapper for clFFT, clBLAS is in the works.

Your doctor doesn&#x27;t have to do that (anymore...) because the regulatory system has provided a network of providers who do it more reliably.<p>Third, your doctor <i>really does</i> have to know how to interpret the results of your blood test.  She can do that because the science is well-established, and the results are directly correlated to certain clinical outcomes.  For most of this genetic testing, there&#x27;s no equivalent interpretation.  That&#x27;s why you need genetic counselors, who know enough to know when an association study is total garbage.  Or if a &quot;50% change in risk&quot; is meaningless in a larger context.<p>In short, it isn&#x27;t especially onerous to want 23andMe to report only those genetic variations that are based on clinically relevant data, for which their tests are accurate and precise.

Coming originally from Scotland, I can tell you the primary interest is in events affecting Rangers or Celtic football [soccer to North Americans] clubs.  Surveillance ?  Only of interest if it gives more details on what the favoured football club is doing.  Politics is, by definition, saying how much you hate Margaret Thatcher - her death did nothing to diminish the constant blame attached to her despite it being more than 20 years since she was UK Prime Minister.  The monotonous regularity would be a source of humour if it were not for the fact these are supposed to be serious people leading a country forward to independence on the world stage.<p>Any spying on citizens in the UK is universal - the component countries do not make a difference to that in any way.  CCTV, number plate cameras etc. are all present and operate universal surveillance throughout the UK.  Nowhere is there any sizeable objection to it - especially since &quot;only people with something to hide would object to the monitoring&quot;.<p>UK residents would do well to heed the words of Benjamin Franklin :<p>&quot;They who would give up essential Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety&quot;<p>Perhaps we would all benefit from remembering the US Founding Fathers who had railed against the rot of the UK by 1776 - it is amazing how much resonance their words have today and how much their meaning has been lost even to Americans who should know better.",1385472030

6800955,comment,6800265,6800265,5,0,recuter,,,"Cowen bluntly predicted what he called “wage polarization.” The increasing ability of computers to perform ordinary tasks will inexorably transform America into an income oligarchy in which the top 15 percent of people—with skills “that are a complement to the computer”—will enjoy “cheery” labor-market prospects and soaring incomes, while the bottom 85 percent, that is to say, 267 million out of America’s 315 million people, will be lucky to find Walmart-level jobs or scrape together marginal “freelance” livings running $25-a-pop errands for their betters via TaskRabbit (say, picking up and delivering a pair of designer shoes from Nordstrom) or renting out their spare bedrooms (if they have any) to overnight lodgers via Airbnb. That is, if they’ll be working at all. “There are many other historical periods, including medieval times, where inequality is high, upward mobility is fairly low, and the social order is fairly stable, even if we as moderns find some aspects of that order objectionable,” Cowen writes in his new book.<p>In other words, what is coming is the “new feudalism,” a phrase coined by Chapman University urban studies professor Joel Kotkin, a prolific media presence whose New Geography website is an outlet for the trend’s most vocal critics. “It’s a weird Upstairs, Downstairs world in which there’s the gentry, and the role for everybody else is to be their servants,” Kotkin said in a telephone interview. “The agenda of the gentry is to force the working class to live in apartments for the rest of their lives and be serfs. But there’s a weird cognitive dissonance. Everyone who says people ought to be living in apartments actually lives in gigantic houses or has multiple houses.”<p>========================================<p>So? Hypocrisy is hardly a new phenomenon. People really <i>are</i> ought to be living in apartments, even if it is suggested as part of some supposed agenda. I really don&#x27;t understand all the anxiety that pops up on HN every once in a while with regard to some imaginary utopia that is decades away if it will ever come at all - Inequality is entirely secondary to the Median, the article describes a high quality of life all around with the upper echelons of society a sort of step-function above &quot;everybody else&quot;.

A lot of the class divide seems to be most evident in housing costs.<p>Where do these $1 million tract house valuations come from, if the middle class engineers can&#x27;t afford to buy them? It would appear that they&#x27;re mostly owned by people that have been living in the area for the past 20 years? And because people have not moved, even though they are apparently no longer in the middle class, the supply has been constrained and the few houses that do go on the market go for extremely large amounts of money.<p>Anyway, I&#x27;m not sure what to make of the article. There are troubling comparisons, and glimpses at incredible wealth, but the parts of the article don&#x27;t seem to fit together very well into a picture of what&#x27;s going on.",1385471908

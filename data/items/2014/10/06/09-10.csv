I agree that at the US prison system “is an expensive way to make bad people worse” as the old saying goes, but I don&#x27;t understand your point in saying that. Are you arguing that no one should be sent to jail until reform occurs? Are you calling for wholesale reform of the prison system? Will you be voting for politicians who aren&#x27;t &quot;tough on crime&quot;?<p>If so, then you should change your tactics. You started off focusing on weev, and suggesting that those who supported his imprisonment should be embarrassed for doing so. This suggests that you are defending weev, but that it&#x27;s okay to imprison all those other people who aren&#x27;t weev.<p>I&#x27;m embarrassed that the US incarceration is 7x that of Europe, conditions in the jail so poor, and chances of returning to public society so reduced.

It too was a domestic (US) piece of legislation, but it&#x27;s &quot;forced&quot; on other uses (through sites like Reddit, etc.) in countries where it doesn&#x27;t specifically apply.<p>The data retention scheme proposed by the Australian Government is draconian. It has very little public oversight, it costs consumers money and inhibits the free ideal of the internet. At a basic level, the spooks want every IP address of every consumer for every connection to be kept (by the ISP) for two years.<p>My name, address (subscriber information) will be tied to my IP by the ISP. I connect at 5:43am to Facebook. That&#x27;s logged. I leave Facebook and log onto Reddit at 5:55am, that&#x27;s logged. For two years. I send an email to Activists-R-US at 6am, that&#x27;s logged. Not the &quot;content&quot;, just the fact that I did it.<p>And, best of all, it&#x27;s all classified as &quot;metadata&quot;, so accessing the records <i>doesn&#x27;t even need a warrant</i>. In fact, any agency in the country with &quot;investigative powers&quot; can request the records from the ISP. That includes, and is not limited to, councils who are investigating lost dogs or parking infringements.<p>The Attorney-General in Australia, George Brandis, couldn&#x27;t even describe or explain what he wanted to be retained: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbtgULCY5zk"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbtgULCY5zk</a><p>We already have fairly tight rules when it comes to internet spying. Every ISP - to get a carrier licence - needs to submit a Interception Capability Plan (ICP) with the Government, explaining how it can - if necessary - tap that connection for spying. If you change your network and it changes the way the lines are tapped, you have to let the Government know straight away.<p>We also have mandatory retention orders, which can be applied to a subscriber account if a court sees fit. This orders the ISP to keep the information on the user for a limited time.<p>If the authorities have their suspicions, they have ample opportunity to get what they want under the current laws.<p>Data retention is, as I said, draconian. It turns presumption of innocence on its head, and it will be used - one day - to track down to prosecute and jail journalists and whistleblowers.<p>It will eventually be used to track down and prosecute copyright infringers and &quot;trolls&quot;.<p>I realise that&#x27;s a slippery slope argument, but legislation - once it&#x27;s on the books - is often used for things it wasn&#x27;t intended for.",1412589031

Finally, the ideology and rhetoric of freedom and openness can then be used to (a) suppress concerns by labeling them as “censorship” and, to (b) rationalize low female participation as simply a matter of women’s choice.<p>> I argue that some otherwise commendable features of the free culture movement also contribute to the gender gap. That is, the geek stereotype and discursive style can be unappealing, open communities are especially susceptible to difficult people, and the ideas of freedom and openness can be used to dismiss concerns and rationalize the gender gap as a matter of preference and choice.<p>I&#x27;m making a second reply purely to point out that the article you cited talked about confounding influences as being one of the main sources of the problem, while you attacked my comment for talking about confounding influences being part of the solution.<p>That seems absolutely insane, and suggests you didn&#x27;t actually respond to my comment on the merits, but rather, out of anger someone didn&#x27;t agree with you.",1412589005

In fact, the results from this tool were total garbage for the last local search I&#x27;d done (zurich augenarzt). It gave me results in Germany, results where the address and map pins were wrong, a link to the front page of some local search company I&#x27;d never heard of, etc.<p>To go back to my previous example, in fact the <i>most</i> appropriate result that this extension was able to give was pointing to the Facebook page of a eye care center in Zurich (hey, at least it was the right city) showing content that had basically nothing to do with their business. The only valuable content from the point of view of a potential customer was the link to their actual website. Which brings me to the next point.<p>Second, the supposed Google+ results are not actually Google+ results. The link is generally pointing to the website of the business itself. At least for me that&#x27;s generally the result I want. The Google+ page is only used as a fallback when Google doesn&#x27;t know which website is associated with the business. Of course a local search company&#x27;s goal is for as many users as possible to be funneled to their web site. It&#x27;s not a goal I&#x27;m very sympathetic to.<p>Would the &quot;few engineers from different local search companies doing this purely as a side project&quot; still be happy if the link to their site was treated the same way the G+ pages are treated in the results right now? That is, as an auxilliary link rather than as the main result?<p>Third, companies like Yelp have made it abundantly clear that they don&#x27;t want &quot;their&quot; data aggregated by Google. While an actual production version of this would depend on that. You can&#x27;t have it both ways.<p>As a final note, you guys really need to redo that video with a real human doing the talk. It&#x27;s hard to get the viewer to sympathize with a bad voice synthesizer, and it comes across almost as cowardly. And worst of all it&#x27;s pretty hard to understand.

And this is a concrete benefit that has had plenty of research to confirm it.<p>> What I claim here is that there is a huge difference between the practice of meditation that people are learning and teaching in modern times, and the specifics of the method of self-reflection that Gautama Buddha guided his disciples to make efforts to undergo.<p>This is a very different claim from what you made earlier.<p>> However, I don&#x27;t know you yet, and it would be a mistake of mine to share his real teaching with you if I don&#x27;t confirm how genuine you are.<p>This is just pure, utter bullshit.<p>> To be clear, no, I do not mean that meditation is not sufficient by itself. I mean that meditation is not something that makes you closer to Enlightenment. Enlightenment has very strict preconditions and meditation is not a teaching that you can practice which helps you fulfill those conditions.<p>This was not the claim I was responding to. I was responding to your specific claim that <i>Gautama Buddha</i> did not teach that meditation is the way to enlightenment. This was also the entirety of the context for my use of the term &quot;nirvana&quot;. If you have other beliefs with respect to what enlightenment and nirvana means, that&#x27;s an entirely different subject. While I practice meditation, my interest in Buddhism beyond that is one of a general interest in philosophy - I&#x27;m not a Buddhist.<p>> So I would like to see how you respond before telling you more.<p>I did not ask you to tell me more, I questioned specific claims you made that to me directly disagree with facts, and you avoided answering the questions as best you can.

In iOS8, the scope of DP (data protection) was enhanced to cover additional data with specific respect to the builtin Apple applications (SMS, photos, call logs, etc.). DP, since its introduction in iOS4, has always used the user&#x27;s passcode as part of the encryption secret, and there are APIs available to create files and/or keychain items with data protection on.<p>Notice that there is an interaction between the multitasking/background system and data protection, as applications running background services will need access to a (part of) filesystem and (part of) keychain to operate.

So here is the summary of the article for the fellow plain HTML lovers:<p>> Android has included full disk encryption (FDE) support since version 3.0, but versions prior to 4.4 used a fairly easy to bruteforce key derivation function (PBKDF2 with 2000 iterations). Additionally, because the disk encryption password is the same as the lockscreen one, most users tend to use simple PINs or passwords (unless a device administrator enforces password complexity rules), which further facilitates bruteforcing. Android 4.4 replaced the disk encryption KDF with scrypt, which is much harder to crack and cannot be implemented efficiently on off-the-shelf GPU hardware. In addition to enabling FDE out of the box, Android L is expected to include hardware protection for disk encryption keys, as well as  hardware acceleration for encrypted disk access. These two features should make FDE on Android both more secure and much faster.",1412586771

How did they get away with trademarking “Square”?\ncrazypyro<p>“Keep fighting, Boris!

Then, considering detailed balance, how does an antenna matched to a terminated coax cable establish thermal equilibrium with space? What happens is that the 1/f^2 of the antenna pattern is cancelled by the f^2 (in the long-wavelength regime) of the Rayleigh-Jeans blackbody radiation formula.",1410703023

Further if the definition were so limited, then we could say that everything has &quot;gone viral&quot;, making the phrase meaningless -- instead there is some level of scale necessary, which I don&#x27;t think this level of success meets.<p>HN is a finicky, short-attention span beast, by design. A front page of HN, and tens of thousands of uniques, often yields zero residual &quot;value&quot; (seriously, zero.

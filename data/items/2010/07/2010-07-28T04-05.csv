(Examples of currently bad matchers that might benefit from this code: hacker news’s, gmail’s)<p>When they get a tiny bit clumsy, but before they get so clumsy that adding a bunch of parsing machinery is really worth the trouble, regexps are still the best solution.<p>* * *<p>Markdown, on the other hand, John Gruber’s more famous project, would be much improved (especially for people interested in extending it) by having its specification written in terms of a real grammar.",1280293041

The original Red and Blue games already had unusually large amounts of save data for a GB game, enough that emulators at the time of their release did not properly support them, and I'm pretty sure it was well-compressed(within the constraint of guaranteeing a worst-case size). It's unlikely that it would fit after adding additional state to every enemy trainer and species in the game.

I guess when that happens investors aren't really willing to bet that the pay service will continue to grow once there's a free alternative.<p>Which isn't to say that's always true...<p>",1187672362

44649,comment,44580,44637,0,0,Zak,,,"I love that book, but I have to agree with you: it's intended to teach Lisp, not programming. If you don't already know how to program, you probably won't learn programming <i>or</i> Lisp from PCL. Instead, you're likely to get turned off to both.<p>The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs is a great book for learning the fundamentals of programming. It happens to use Scheme, a dialect of Lisp. If you want an academic introduction to programming, it's one of the best. I haven't found anything as good that takes a more pragmatic ""let's build something useful/fun and learn to program in the process"" approach, but I bet someone else here has.",1187671341

44646,comment,44580,44618,0,0,brianmckenzie,,,"JS is better as a second language, because of DOM issues. It's better for a beginner not to have to worry about those. It is very convenient for beginners because it's built into the browsers, and many people learn it concurrently with something else. You could do a lot <i>worse</i> than JS.<p>For a first language, look at Python/Ruby and choose what you're most comfortable with.",1187671033

44644,comment,44580,44618,0,0,Zak,,,"Maybe. On the plus side, it's a pretty nice language - somewhere between Python and Ruby on the power continuum, I think. The C-like syntax is more complicated than Python, Ruby or Lisp, but familiarity with C syntax is probably advisable for anyone trying to get an overview of programming in today's world.<p>Implementations and libraries are a drawback. I think the best way to learn a language is to build something interesting using it, and the only thing that's easy to build with Javascript these days is the client-side part of a website. Doing that also requires CSS and HTML, which the OP should probably learn a bit about, but it might be distracting to do that while he's trying to learn the fundamentals of programming. Trying to learn Emacs at the same time I was learning Lisp was distracting for me. I don't think browser incompatibilities are a reason to shun JS; unless you're building something for a website used by the general public, just target Firefox. Use Firebug to learn what's going on with your code and track down problems. Once you know what you're doing, it's more tedious than difficult to get it working on other browsers.<p>If you already know how to make web pages, or really want to learn, JS is probably a good choice. If not, it probably isn't. It's probably best to can figure out what sort of project you'd like to build, and then learn a language well-suited to building it.<p>It's possible to use Javascript for other purposes, but it's not yet easy. In a couple years, that might change - Steve Yegge seems to think it's the ""next big language"".",1187670785

44637,comment,44580,44580,0,0,daniel-cussen,,,"I'm learning on Lisp, and it's kind of weird.  I'm using <i>Practical Common Lisp</i> (<a href=""http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/</a>) and I have to reread chapters a few times to really understand them.  I downloaded Lisp in a Box for it, and that is weird because it's rickety.  The tutorial isn't there, and it will keep kicking me out of the SLIME.<p>I'm in the middle of a four-month vacation, but progress is pathetic.  Lisp in a box and <i>Practical Common Lisp</i> aren't helping me stay on task.  The look like they're made for guys who are learning their sixth programming language.<p>If you're looking to learn Lisp, try to find something ostensibly beginner-friendly.

44635,comment,44580,44615,0,0,Goladus,,,"Having programmed in both C and assembly, I wouldn't say ""a hair's breadth"" is an accurate characterization.  It looks like a high level language, and it's easy to use it like one.  But it's equally easy to misunderstand C's semantics, they're often subtly different from what you'd expect.  An obvious example is the array[index].  There are complicated syntax rules required to do some fundamental things, such as passing parameters by reference.  Strings are a nightmare, and of course don't forget malloc() and free().  <p>I only recommend learning C first if you have handy: an excellent instructor or an excellent book-- preferably both.  I might also recommend C if you already know a lot about how computers work architecturally but don't know much about languages.<p>With python and ruby, just go to www.python.org or www.ruby-lang.org.  Several good resources have been mentioned for Scheme.  In those cases, you'll get familiar with the basic idea of telling the computer what to do, as well as fundamentals like expressions and abstractions.  Going the SICP+Scheme route will introduce you to recursion and high-order functions fairly quickly, while Ruby and Python have all sorts of practical libraries.  Interpreters for Javascript are more readily available than C compilers, though at the moment I can't recommend an ideal place to go learn about it.  JS is everywhere though.<p>I love C, and think that an undergraduate Computer Science curriculum should require learning it early on.  But for someone who wants to learn to hack on their own, C is probably not the best choice.",1187669247

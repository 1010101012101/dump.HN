I think other campus LJ communities did the same as well.<p>I'm surprised at the critical attitudes -- that there are two competitors is reason for encouragement and indicates that the market you're targeting is no illusion. All you have to do is make your site better and better-known than the other guys.",1219729556

I'm fine with leaving it the way it is (save a few modifications to the profile screen so that the users know email addresses aren't publicized), that way, if someone does contact me, I'll know that they know their way around Google and the rest of the internet, and that pre-qualifies them :)",1219728579

286796,comment,286162,286162,0,0,jackowayed,,,"I really like it. An ""Ignore rule"" button would be nice. If you're trying to demonstrate a strong vocabulary in your paper, you might not ever want simpler words. 
(I chose that rule in particular because you seem to have made that rule too aggressive. A passage of solely simple words, while possibly more clear, is not as pleasant to read.)<p>Your suggestions don't always actually fit, but that's true of certain large, expensive pieces of software (Microsoft Word) too.<p>Also, allowing people to upload files (at least text files, maybe rtf and doc if you can parse them into text) might be nice so they don't have to select and paste it all.<p>Overall it looks like a very useful site though.",1219727976

I could imagine one on the nightstand, the end table by the couch, or on the coffee table.  It would be in a convenient place to pick up.  You could make this touchscreen, but you wouldn't even have to do that.  Just have simple D-pad navigation, perhaps behind the frame.<p>An add-on with some simple remote control facility would make it a 3-use device.

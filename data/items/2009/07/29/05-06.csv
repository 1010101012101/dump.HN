Their official tagline is ""Keep walking"" - but they use ""Just keep walking"" in many of their advertisements.<p>EX: ""There's no elevator to success. You have to take the stairs.  Just keep walking. - Johnnie Walker.""<p>I first saw the quote ""Just Keep Walking"" in THIS specific context several years ago when Johnnie Walker published an in-magazine booklet targeted to entrepreneurs.  I think it was in Fast Company or Business 2.0.  Maybe both of them. I sent off and received a free t-shirt from them with that quote and their logo of a silhouetted man walking.  The striding man.  The booklet talked about persistence and determination, etc.  It was called something like ""Just keep walking:  A handbook for entrepreneurs.""<p>[P.S. - Sorry to ruin your story/anecdote.]",1248847181

You need to know the area of the impact, and even harder is calculating how long the deceleration takes.</i><p>Energy is the integral of force times distance (uh, dot-product there: ∫F⃗·dx⃗, where x⃗ is position). The distance should be pretty easy to put bounds on: no substantial force was being applied to the spring until it made contact with the helmet, and after that it, and the helmet, and the driver, deformed until the energy of the impact was transferred into some form other than the kinetic energy of the spring moving into the helmet.  That lets you put a lower bound on the force. (Of course it doesn't allow you to put an upper bound on it.)",1248844176

It isn't adequate for a Wordpress blog, to say nothing of a web application your customers will be relying on.<p>Get yourself a VPS.  They're absurdly cheap -- 3 months on Slicehost will run you $75.  (I assumed you would want backups.  If that was not in the cards, reevaluate your readiness to be trusted with anyone else's data.)  If you have an iPhone, you have far more than $75 available if you apply yourself.  If you absolutely, positively do not have $75, skip your next run out for pizza, get yourself shared hosting from GoDaddy (for about $4 a month last time I checked), and put up with the nuisances of shared hosting (which is still better than self hosting!) until you have revenue.  Then, go to a VPS.",1248844156

If it's already php, and you use .NET just for image manipulation, it should not be hard to do.<p>First see if the built in php image functions <a href=""http://php.net/manual/en/refs.utilspec.image.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://php.net/manual/en/refs.utilspec.image.php</a> are good enough (you have a choice of three libraries to pick from), and if not, then use the command line program imagemagick (probably the command 'convert').<p>You might even be able to install imagemagick on windows, so you don't have to switch your desktop to linux. Then get linux hosting and work out any porting issues.<p>Another thing to try is some of the personal plans - I've seen some that are just $4 per month. If everything is done internally in PHP you should have a pretty easy time using those. If you need to install extra programs it gets a bit harder.<p>You personal machine is fine for CPU, but not for network. An online hosting place will be good for network, but probably not much CPU.<p>I don't know how much CPU you need, but maybe, if you need a lot of CPU. and you can do stuff offline, write the program in two parts - an online section, and then use your machine to download, and process the images, then send them back up.",1248844130

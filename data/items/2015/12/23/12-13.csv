Serving a SHA-1 cert to users whose browsers cannot understand newer cryptography seems like you&#x27;d be claiming that the security of those users&#x27; connections is not something you consider meaningful, as those users are still vulnerable to SHA-1 attacks. This just raises the barrier for entry to attack those users (compared to plaintext), except those users will potentially be unaware anything is wrong.<p>As the article states, 37 million visitors were using outdated crypto - that&#x27;s 37 million potential sets of private information I could skim with a forged cert.

10782976,comment,10781091,10781091,0,0,epalmer,,,"I&#x27;m lucky that I have an office to myself.  I nap almost every day after my mid-day snack (I eat three times at work, small amounts).  I usually drink a cup of green or black tea right before.  I nap sitting up in a chair and I run a timer. I don&#x27;t alarm the timer, I just want to know how long I have napped. Usually it is 8 mins to 23 mins and typically about 12 seems to be the median.<p>My ability to nap goes a long way back. Between undergraduate and graduate school I worked rotating shifts in a textile mill and had a job where I fed cloth into a large continuous washing machine.  I needed to tend to the machine every 5 to 10 mins.  I used to nap standing up for 1 to 2 minutes.  Maybe it was more like meditation. But whatever it was it helped me through the night. This was in the mid 1970s.<p>In the early 80’s I used to fly 48 to 50 weeks a year.  With delayed flights and customers that wanted to extract a full week of consulting for me I flew oten early morning and late evening.  I trained myself to sleep while the jet was taking off.  Even with the noise of the engine I was able to nap.  Now, when we travel for fun I have a hard time not sleeping for the first 15 minutes of the flight. This really surprises my family.<p>Around 2010 I had a meditation coach that gave me a post hypnotic suggestion (self hypnosis and meditation are really close to the same thing, at least for me) to go into a trance when I put my hands in a certain position.  So now when I nap I do that with my hands and 9 times out of 10 my brain quiets down and within a minute I am out.  Sometimes I don’t nap and I just quiet the brain (mindfulness meditation) but either way I feel better and am more productive.<p>My afternoon productivity is so much better. I can awaken. turn around, turn the lights on and start coding (Java, Python) within a few minutes. My productivity is so much better after a nap.<p>I’m 62 and want to work another 5 years or so.  I see the ability to nap critical to me staying competitive in my workplace.  I’m lucky I can nap sitting up and have my own office. Barring unforeseen issues I will work at the same place for the next 5 years.<p>I do manage my sleep cycle tightly because my wife and I are at the gym at 5:20 AM everyday of the week.  So I am usually in bed at 9 to 9:30. Of course this makes partying harder on the weekend but I’m not much on that anymore. The exercise is so important and I was so late to that game.  My prediabetes is gone (diet also helps) and I am more mobile and just feel better.<p>If you have trouble napping maybe you can find someone to coach you through meditation.  Local universities that have non-credit courses sometimes have meditation classes.  that is how I got my meditation coach.<p>Like normal your mileage may vary.",1450873146

If you&#x27;re going to build a &#x27;process container&#x27; like Docker -- something that does not encourage the same mindset as a traditional container or VM -- it makes sense to start with a stripped-down operating system and then build it up to be exactly what you need.<p>Perhaps loud suggestions like these are necessary due to a bias in the group that uses Docker. 20% people that really know what they&#x27;re doing and have chosen Docker for a specific reason, and the hangers-on who try to emulate them by using the same tools.<p>Docker is an interesting, useful, and extremely overhyped tool. I may be wrong, but I feel like its popularity has caused a bunch of people who don&#x27;t really need Docker to use it. Besides popularity, they can&#x27;t really explain why they are using it over something like LXC or FreeBSD jails.<p>I imagine (again, no data to back this up) that this same large percentage of people are also the ones that just keep using the default Ubuntu image once they finish the &quot;Get Started&quot; tutorial.<p>I&#x27;m glad to see suggestions like this gaining popularity.

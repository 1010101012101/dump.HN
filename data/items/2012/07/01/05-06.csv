4183980,comment,4182889,4182889,12,0,skybrian,,,"As I understand it, when an email address on Facebook gets synced to a phone, that's just a cache. Any updates to the email address on Facebook automatically update the cache. When friends update their email addresses, the cache gets overwritten and you don't have their old addresses anymore.<p>But now, Facebook changed people's email addresses without their permission. The cache gets updated, and boom, the old address is gone.<p>But what makes it more scary is that people don't actually remember that they originally got the address from Facebook and they don't understand the caching behavior. All they know is that the old address is gone. So they think that email addresses that they <i>didn't</i> get from Facebook are also at risk.<p>The workaround is to manually copy email addresses from Facebook to some other system. Any email addresses you get from Facebook by automatically syncing aren't safe.<p>It's a pity; after all, most of the point of the system is that you shouldn't have to manually update your address book when your friends change their contact info.",1341122348

This is, in my opinion, among the worst things they've ever done for user privacy (and security, but mostly privacy in this case), in a long list of subtle, and not-so-subtle tactics.<p>It also has very real security consequences. The automatic contact list updates for potentially millions of users means that sensitive information is likely flowing into facebook servers as we speak, without users knowing it. Passwords, medical information, company secrets, who knows what else? Someone who trusts facebook enough to use it for social interactions might not trust them enough to know about their medical conditions, proprietary company data, passwords for other sites, etc. Facebook took away that privilege for many people with this change.<p>All that said, here's what's important: This does <i>nothing</i> good for users, and a few bad things. The fact that facebook made this change, knowing that the vast majority of users were not interested in using facebook email thus far, tells us that facebook thinks first of facebook. Even if there were no privacy or security concerns, what the user wants wasn't even in the equation, when facebook did the math on this.",1341121242

You don't need many of functions you use in PHP, for instance, _real_escape_string is not needed when you can do cursor.run(""SQL Query param1=? AND param2=?"", [param1, param2])<p>6. You can get help on functions in coding shell:<p>>>> help(open) # help on file opening function\nor even\n>>> open?  # in IPython<p>With that I look into online or PDF docs quite rarely.<p>7. That's even faster in Python: you try things out in the shell, then save the shell session (IPython) and copy the code you need into the working file.<p>Moreover, while in PHP I was adding var_dump's everywhere, reloading a page 10 times before reaching the source of a bug, in Python I just do $ python -m ipdb same_script.py and have the debugging shell in the place I need, and it takes a minute of two to find the source of a bug.",1341118933

By forcing existing desktop users into their mobile experience. And hope that'll be familiar enough to buy old windows users into their mobile ecosystem, but not different enough to scare them away to a different desktop. The start menu is just one of the many pieces that doesn't work well on mobile. So they'll also get rid of it on the desktop, hoping that'll get desktop users familiar with WP.<p>Yea, a bad plan, but I guess that's their vision.",1341118830

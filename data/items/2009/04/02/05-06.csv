A <i>lot</i> of ""idea people"" contact me every day to ""do enough coding for a prototype and then we'll make a shitload of money"". This is how I separate the serious people from the non serious ones.<p>(a) Do you have (some) funding? If you don't have sufficient money to cover my expenses for a few months (and being in Bangalore, I can get by on significantly less than  I could in the United States say, but otoh I get the more kooky ""idea people"") you have nothing to trade with.  This question eliminates 90 % of the ""I have a cool idea"" folks<p>(b) Do you have <i>deep</i> domain knowledge? If you've worked in an industry 20 years you are much more credible when thinking of a killer product  than if you are a freshly minted MBA with no record of having done anything significant in life but has ideas about "" a twitter for insurance"" or whatever.<p>(c) What risk are you taking? I get a lot of ""offers"" from people holding down corporate jobs who want me to work fulltime (of course with zero or minimal compensation) on the ""idea"",but who will hold on to their jobs till ""the idea gets some traction"". :-)<p>(d) If I build a prototype for you in the next 3 months (say) what makes you think you can sell it  or raise money? Are you just hoping or do you have customers lined up (read Steven Blank's ""epiphany"" book for the kind of customer you need). Do you know any venture capitalists or angel investors personally?<p>So in a nutshell, if you have enough money to fund my lifestyle for a few months while I work on the idea, if you have a really good idea, based on deep domain knowledge, if you can market/sell the idea, and you are working fulltime for your startup  <i>then</i> you get  my attention.<p>Look at it this way. Most hackers add value by being able to build anything they can conceive of / believe in. They could be building anything. Why should they build <i>your</i> idea? The good ones are probably working on other interesting/profitable things already.<p>Oh yeah don't please outsource unless you know the person to be a really good programmer. As mentioned above it is hard for a non programmer to judge programmers.<p>Good Luck.",1238651432

It was funny because it was absurd and fun to see such a high rank next to your name.

542956,comment,542240,542627,0,0,tigerthink,,,"There is a weird disparity between the programmers I read on the internet and the programming students I know in real life.  The programmers I read on the internet are self-taught, have side projects, and are intimidating.  The programming students I know in real life are college-taught, generally don't have side projects, and aren't intimidating.<p>I think I belong to the second group more than the first.  Should I switch to a different major?  Or is there a place in the world for programmers who aren't hackers?<p>As a third option, someone might have some magical ""how to become a hacker"" advice that I haven't already read.",1238650294

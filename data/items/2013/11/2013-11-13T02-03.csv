6723048,comment,6722325,6722325,2,0,gault8121,,,"In regards to psychology, read Daniel Kahneman&#x27;s Thinking Fast and Slow. Kahneman describes fast thinking as the instantaneous, subconscious judgements we make, while slow thinking is the conscious, articulated thoughts we have. Kahneman shows how there is a huge disconnect between these two systems, and how this influences our behavior.<p>Another excellent book is Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion. It looks at how people are convinced into doing things (e.g. the effectiveness of various methods of advertising), and how you can guard yourself against these psychological mechanisms. The title sounds cheesy, but it is an excellent book full of concrete, interesting examples.<p>I&#x27;d highly recommend both books. While they may sound sort of salesy, both books deeply examine the process of making a decision.",1384311558

There are positive rights, and negative rights.  The left wants for human rights to be considered positive rights, in that the state (or others) are obligated to provide them for you.  The libertarians want more rights to be considered negative rights, which is to say that that state should be disallowed from intervening in your pursuit of them.<p>The Constitution establishes that the right to keep and bear arms is a human right, but nobody on the left (and probably nobody on the right) would suggest that the state is now obligated to provide firearms to those who want them.  Similarly enumerated is the fourth amendment right to privacy, but nobody on either side seems to be jumping to ensure that the state provides that for us.<p>Why then is healthcare the exemption?  Why is it the right that the state must provide to us?<p>I don&#x27;t know if we should or shouldn&#x27;t have it, or what systems are workable, and what systems aren&#x27;t, so ignoring all other political arguments that apply here, I only take issue with the idea that even if it as a human right, that should obligate somebody to ensure that we have it, especially as it&#x27;s only a small leap away from getting everybody to agree that the internet is a human right, access to a computer is a human right, etc., etc.  And it&#x27;s not so far-fetched, as there are already those suggesting it.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, I don&#x27;t disagree with the premise that it is.<p>Your comment was salient though, and thoughtful, and definitely got my upvote.",1384311548

Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou, the Greek founder of easyJet and easyGroup, said in December, 1996, during an interview he gave for the Wall Street Journal. globalization is defined as, the close integration of countries and people of the world. I feel like you dont feel globalization as strongly in any other human sector than in the business world. Why do we see an increase in the start-up culture all over the world? The answer in my opinion is because of globalization. Throughout my Technology Entrepreneurship in Korea seminar I took earlier this spring when I lived in South Korea, the speakers (one was Korean American and one from Britain who had studied at Cambridge) continuously emphasized the trend that they saw among Korean entrepreneurs, that they were trying to create a Silicon Valley of the East. Now imagine my surprise when I read this article in The Economist Magazine called, Start me up  Londons Tech city, in which it is written that, Tech City looks like it is taking the right steps to becoming a self-sufficient ecosystema sort of Silicon Valley with an East End twang. I call it the Silicon-Valley Effect of Globalization. However, even though the article takes a fairly positive outlook on Londons start up culture, I am doubtful as to whether these predictions really can come true.<p>One thing I learned during this seminar in Korea is that even though South Koreans are trying hard to create a similar Silicon Valley, they will never be able to duplicate it. Why? Because the culture and the way you do business in Korea is simply too different......(GO TO http://globalyuppiestyle.com/2013/11/12/start-me-up/ TO READ FULL ARTICLE!!)",1384311292

     has a soul.
Prairie and valley, streets of the city, pour people into
     it and they mingle among its twenty floors and are
     poured out again back to the streets, prairies and
     valleys.
It is the men and women, boys and girls so poured in and
     out all day that give the building a soul of dreams
     and thoughts and memories.
(Dumped in the sea or fixed in a desert, who would care
     for the building or speak its name or ask a policeman
     the way to it?)<p>Elevators slide on their cables and tubes catch letters and
     parcels and iron pipes carry gas and water in and
     sewage out.
Wires climb with secrets, carry light and carry words,
     and tell terrors and profits and loves--curses of men
     grappling plans of business and questions of women
     in plots of love.<p>Hour by hour the caissons reach down to the rock of the
     earth and hold the building to a turning planet.
Hour by hour the girders play as ribs and reach out and
     hold together the stone walls and floors.<p>Hour by hour the hand of the mason and the stuff of the
     mortar clinch the pieces and parts to the shape an
     architect voted.
Hour by hour the sun and the rain, the air and the rust,
     and the press of time running into centuries, play
     on the building inside and out and use it.<p>Men who sunk the pilings and mixed the mortar are laid
     in graves where the wind whistles a wild song
     without words
And so are men who strung the wires and fixed the pipes
     and tubes and those who saw it rise floor by floor.
Souls of them all are here, even the hod carrier begging
     at back doors hundreds of miles away and the brick-
     layer who went to state&#x27;s prison for shooting another
     man while drunk.
(One man fell from a girder and broke his neck at the
     end of a straight plunge--he is here--his soul has
     gone into the stones of the building.)<p>On the office doors from tier to tier--hundreds of names
     and each name standing for a face written across
     with a dead child, a passionate lover, a driving
     ambition for a million dollar business or a lobster&#x27;s
     ease of life.<p>Behind the signs on the doors they work and the walls
     tell nothing from room to room.
Ten-dollar-a-week stenographers take letters from
     corporation officers, lawyers, efficiency engineers,
     and tons of letters go bundled from the building to all
     ends of the earth.
Smiles and tears of each office girl go into the soul of
     the building just the same as the master-men who
     rule the building.<p>Hands of clocks turn to noon hours and each floor
     empties its men and women who go away and eat
     and come back to work.
Toward the end of the afternoon all work slackens and
     all jobs go slower as the people feel day closing on
     them.
One by one the floors are emptied. . . The uniformed
     elevator men are gone. Pails clang. . . Scrubbers
     work, talking in foreign tongues. Broom and water
     and mop clean from the floors human dust and spit,
     and machine grime of the day.
Spelled in electric fire on the roof are words telling
     miles of houses and people where to buy a thing for
     money. The sign speaks till midnight.<p>Darkness on the hallways. Voices echo. Silence
     holds. . . Watchmen walk slow from floor to floor
     and try the doors. Revolvers bulge from their hip
     pockets. . . Steel safes stand in corners. Money
     is stacked in them.
A young watchman leans at a window and sees the lights
     of barges butting their way across a harbor, nets of
     red and white lanterns in a railroad yard, and a span
     of glooms splashed with lines of white and blurs of
     crosses and clusters over the sleeping city.

That tends to be the first indicator of the need for sales reps.<p>Equally, and perhaps more importantly, remember that direct to consumers is a market for these products only because of clinical teams recommending them. Their typical sales targets are huge, and are acquired in big bulk contracts with entire hospitals, if not healthcare regional bodies. Contracts on that scale are, again, typically done via sales teams who work closely with a client, build a relationship, and help the client get the most out of their sales. This model also exists in the tech industry, and indeed is how most Big Enterprise IT works.<p>I&#x27;m sure they could get more direct to consumer sales if they improved their website, yes.

It might cost someone $100/month to take some pills -- or cost the state $10k+ when they have a life-threatening episode of whatever ails them.  If the price of the preventative care is too expensive, and there&#x27;s light at the end of the tunnel (so long as you survive your critical episode, I guess), then there&#x27;s an incentive to just wait it out until it gets so bad it&#x27;s free.<p>I live in New Zealand, and I have Ulcerative Colitis.  We have a public/private system somewhere along the lines you propose (although a little more forgiving), and are really quite lucky:<p>* There&#x27;s a strong tendency for doctors to work both publicly and privately.  They&#x27;ll put in time at the public facilities, but those facilities are generally pretty highly loaded -- turnarounds can be slow.  If you&#x27;ve got the money, you can see most privately (that&#x27;s generally not overly expensive).<p>* Thanks to a Government agency known as Pharmac, we bulk buy all our drugs -- so, I pay $5/prescription (prescriptions can last up to 3 months), instead of $120+/prescription.  For someone with a chronic condition like myself, this is fantastic.  It also works out cheaper for the Government too: we have the market power to negotiate much better deals from pharma companies.<p>* If you do get into a critical state, the public system will provide care.  Alternatively, if you&#x27;ve got insurance, you can go private (but private care for critical stuff -- where surgery/non-Pharmac drugs are required -- is generally prohibitively expensive).<p>* Elective/preventative care is also available publicly.  This means you&#x27;re in a queue (&quot;we&#x27;ll get around to it sometime in the next year&quot;), but does mean you&#x27;re able to maintain a higher quality of life.<p>Medicine is hard: reconciling care with expenses is a moral quagmire.

6722925,comment,6718427,6718427,6,0,tokenadult,,,"Bill Gates writes in the article kindly submitted here, after giving some examples of inventions, &quot;Thanks to inventions like these, life has steadily gotten better. It can be easy to conclude otherwiseas I write this essay, more than 100,000 people have died in a civil war in Syria, and big problems like climate change are bearing down on us with no simple solution in sight. But if you take the long view, by almost any measure of progress we are living in historys greatest era. Wars are becoming less frequent. Life expectancy has more than doubled in the past century. More children than ever are going to primary school. The world is better than it has ever been.&quot;<p>And that is correct. I&#x27;ll focus on the huge increase in life expectancy, since that is often discussed here on HN. The low-hanging fruit of increasing life expectancy is increasing it for young people, by reducing infant and child mortality. The Gates Foundation does a lot of work in developing and delivering vaccines to protect children against infectious diseases. That means mothers can be more sure of their children surviving infancy, and all over the world (as other comments here have already pointed out), that results in a &quot;demographic transition,&quot; of families eventually having dramatically fewer children. Children who grow up healthy and survive to adulthood do a lot to transform societies from backwardness into development and innovation.<p>The increases in lifespan are occurring at the old end of the lifespan too.[1] (This is a point that is often specifically denied in HN discussions, so I thought I should draw attention to it here.) Life expectancy at age 40, at age 60, and at even higher ages is still rising throughout the developed countries of the world. The increase in lifespan in developed countries has been so steady for so long that a girl born in the developed world since the year 2000 has a better than even chance of celebrating her 100th birthday, with boys likely to live almost as long.[2] And this comes from steady, incremental progress in the prevention and treatment of disease and the maintenance of good general health, not at all from any path-breaking research in &quot;life extension.&quot; This suggests that similar day-by-day improvements in human life can come about from simple, barely noticed better practice replacing former haphazard practice. The programmers who Bill Gates encourages to join in on solving problems of the world may be able to harness computer power to notice patterns in data that may improve health and longevity, environmental quality, recycling of natural resources, and a variety of other important aspects of human life little by little all over the world.<p>I read <i>The Limits to Growth</i> when I was a kid, soon after the book was published. It was the most spectacularly factually incorrect set of predictions of all the predictions of the future I have ever read. I think Bill Gates here is writing based on a better understanding of how the world works, and I expect when my daughter has her 100th birthday in the twenty-second century that she will enjoy a world almost unimaginably better for almost all people than the world we share today.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=longevity-why-we-die-global-life-expectancy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=longevity-w...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.demographic-challenge.com/files/downloads/2eb51e2860ef54d218ce5ce19abe6a59/dc_biodemography_of_human_ageing_nature_2010_vaupel.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.demographic-challenge.com/files/downloads/2eb51e2...</a><p><a href=""http://www.prb.org/Journalists/Webcasts/2010/humanlongevity.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.prb.org/Journalists/Webcasts/2010/humanlongevity....</a>",1384309157

The security of the blockchain remains unimpacted, it is as relevant to the fundamentals of the currency as much as someone getting robbed is relevant to the fundamentals of the fiat currency they were robbed in.<p>2) Much whining and gnashing of teeth ensues as to how bitcoin is going to collapse any second now because clearly it is just some crazy snake oil and look at the rash of compromises as evidence, and by the way it also happens I disapprove of it because it goes against my views on what a currency needs to be.<p>3) People respond much along the lines I&#x27;m responding now.<p>4) It devolves into an ideological argument along the lines of the characteristics of the currency itself and the potential death of fiat money and its implications.<p>Conclusion; Some people are fundamentally ideologically opposed to bitcoin and will use whatever they can to drag it through the mud at every opportunity.<p>Compromising the blockchain or the fundamentals of bitcoin itself is news, even when it&#x27;s overblown or exaggerated like the recent Cornell findings, some venture getting owned because they failed to adequately secure their place of business is par for the course and barely a footnote at this point in time.<p>For the first time in normal everyday business history, security <i>really matters</i> now. You can&#x27;t just put up a banner with the legal penalties for acting against corporate policy and actually expect to hold people accountable via the legal system for ignoring your banner, the new rules are that you need <i>real</i> security.<p>Frankly I think that&#x27;s a good thing and something that is far overdue, the swiss cheese state of general security practices coupled with the apathy and ignorance of general computer users has gone on for far too long, but because the individuals in question were never held personally to account there was never the motivation to really fix the problem.<p>Now there is, people need to accept this new paradigm if they want to deal in this space.",1384308726

At the least I was hoping for a way to resize it or make it transparent so that it wouldn&#x27;t interrupt my workflow when I needed to launch a program.  Alas, MS it seems is pushing its tablet interface on us whether we like it or not, and desktop users be damned...<p>So I spent a month fooling around with Spy++ and figuring out how to make the Start Screen do what I wanted.  What I have isn&#x27;t perfect, but I am able to adjust the size and transparency of the Start Screen, which was my goal.  I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s pre-alpha at this point, but functional.<p>I&#x27;m making this post to see if anyone is interested in contributing to the project, or even using it...I am definitely more motivated to polish it up if I know the project is scratching other people&#x27;s itches and not just my own.<p>Thanks!  And of course any feedback is appreciated!<p>PS. I know there are many other products that do this same thing, but the ones I tried either didn&#x27;t work, were full of installer add-on garbage, or didn&#x27;t have the resize capability that I wanted.

When a militia member in Africa forces a child to murder his parents, we consider that unequivocally wrong, yet when a government murders his parents we consider that a legitimate projection of lethal force, perhaps only b/c we don&#x27;t know the details.<p>So while governments do have some legitimacy and do a lot of good, the basic structures (consent, monopoly on coercion, and propaganda) are ripe for abuse and (I&#x27;d argue) transition into covert/improper use of force as they stabilize and their purpose becomes widely viewed as oriented toward peacetime activities.",1384308456

But there are many times when recursion is more attractive still. But what to do if your language doesn&#x27;t have TCO, and blowing the callstack is a real concern? Well, then you can use trampolines![2]<p>Now, trampolines are great, but you don&#x27;t need to always reach for them. An analysis should be done of the problem at hand, and &quot;the right tool chosen for the task&quot;, which may be a simple `while` loop. The same goes for monads. Are there cases where the State Monad makes the most sense among other programming patterns? Yes, I think so. Particularly, when you are trying to model a multi-step and nested-steps computation where the steps are intertwined in such a way that one can easily identify &quot;global state&quot; at work. In that case, the State Monad is a tool that will let you thread the global state through the steps and levels of computation without having to twist yourself into knots doing it some other way AND without relying on unfettered mutability.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.clojure.net/2012/02/10/State/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.clojure.net/2012/02/10/State/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://raganwald.com/2013/03/28/trampolines-in-javascript.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://raganwald.com/2013/03/28/trampolines-in-javascript.ht...</a><p>[&] <a href=""http://clojure.github.io/clojure/clojure.core-api.html#clojure.core/trampoline"" rel=""nofollow"">http://clojure.github.io/clojure/clojure.core-api.html#cloju...</a>",1384308313

2496881,comment,2496173,2496749,3,0,zizee,,,"What are you talking about? When people say ""information wants to be free"" they are (obviously) not talking about physical objects.<p>The idea that information wants to be free stems from the market principles of supply and demand. Price is determined by supply and demand. Digital information can be duplicated at almost zero cost, so there is a pressure on it to become cheaper and cheaper until free.<p>The idea that information wants to be free is also contradicted by the idea that ""Information is power"" etc. The less people you can restrict information to the more it is worth. Also, timely information can be very valuable (like in insider trading) that information can have value (i.e. no free as in beer).<p>But just because information can be duplicated infinitely, it doesn't mean that it will be duplicated infinitely, meaning that the value of the information will be determined by the costs of production and demand. Will this value of the information be enough to cover the costs? This will be the determining factor as to whether people can continue to make a living from producing information. On the flipside, the costs of making quality information are rapidly decreasing, so it should be getting easier and easier to make a living from information.<p>In the end, I think that information will always have value. The key will be for the producers of that information to find a way to connect with people willing to pay for it.",1304071161

2496870,comment,2495809,2495809,4,0,astrec,,,"There's quite a nice quote on the subject from Terence Tao (Livingston, Sir Ken; The Element; pp 100-101):<p>""I think the most important thing for developing an interest in mathematics is to have the ability and the freedom to play with mathematics -- to set little challenges for oneself, to devise little games, and so on. Having good mentors was very important for me, because it gave me the chance to discuss these sorts of mathematical recreations; the formal classroom environment is of course best for learning theory and applications, and for appreciating the subject as a whole, but it isn't a good place to learn how to experiment.<p>Perhaps one character trait which does help is the ability to focus, and perhaps to be a little stubborn. If I learned something in class that I only partly understood, I wasn't satisfied until I was able to work the whole thing out; it would bother me that the explanation wasn't clicking together like it should. So I'd often spend a lot of time on very simple things until I could understand them backwards and forwards, which really helps when one then moves on to more advanced parts of the subject.<p>I don't have any magical ability, I look at a problem, and it looks something like one I've already done; I think maybe the idea that worked before will work here. When nothing's working out then I think of a small trick that makes it a little better, but still is not quite right. I play with the problem, and after a while, I figure out what is going on. If I experiment enough, I get a deeper understanding. It's not about being smart or even fast. It's like climbing a cliff -- if you're very strong and quick and have a lot of rope, it helps, but you need to devise a good route to get up there. Doing calculations quickly and knowing a lot of facts are like a rock climber with strength, quickness, and good tools; you still need a plan -- that's the hard part -- and you have to see the bigger picture.""",1304070738

2496857,comment,2496818,2496818,8,0,gexla,,,"Build fake projects?  Geez, I think you already have the wrong mindset for starting your own business.  If you are going to put the time into building a site, try to monetize that thing (no fakes.)  Who knows, down the road you might be making enough money off that site or collection of sites so that you can quit client work.<p>I also think that you are suffering from the classic symptom of trying to get everything just right before starting.  When building a web app you want to get that thing up as fast as possible, even if it's ugly.  Build a minimum viable product and connect with customers each step of the way.  Test for interest, etc.  You don't want to spend too much time getting everything correct just to find that you wasted your time because nobody cares for your idea.<p>Take a similar approach with web development.  You could start out banging out sites in Drupal or Wordpress and each of these content management systems require more configuration than actual programming.  You can learn these quickly and with minimal to no PHP.  Your interest may be more in building web applications from scratch and there is a market for that, but you don't have to start out there.  I know of plenty of people making a living strictly from building sites using already available content management systems.<p>Look through sites like Odesk and Elance for the types of jobs available.  You might find the occasional gem in these places and even land a regular client.  Don't feel bad for your lack of experience, you just need to be able to sell yourself and communicate well.  Trust me, there are far worse people actually landing the jobs there.<p>Make sure to network through forums, Twitter and other locations where fellow developers and designers hang out.  Twitter is especially good for getting a regular voice in the community and getting your name in front of people.  Help out people in Twitter and forums and you will occasionally get someone hitting you up for doing some work.<p>As you are connecting with the community, look for ideas for building add-ons which might be in demand.  This is a great way to give back and get your name out there.  Offer some simple add-ons for free, but you might be able to make money by selling other add-ons.<p>As you beef up your freelance business and development chops, you can start moving more in the direction of building applications from scratch and perhaps working with other tools.  There is a lot of exciting new things going on in the world of web development.  I have been playing with Node.js a lot lately and it's a new community where you can more easily gain a good foothold as a pioneer as opposed to PHP.  However, the market for this may not be as easy to get into at first.<p>There are also lots of methods I haven't mentioned or even thought about.  Another big part of business is strategy and tactics.  Figure out where you want to be and be creative in formulating a plan to get there.  Do this and you might be able to leapfrog (greater income) people who have been doing this for a lot longer than you have.",1304069972

2496818,story,,,24,21,tripplez,"Ask HN: Beginning freelance web developer: no clients - portfolio?",,"A short introduction: I'm a programmer with appr. 8 years of experience mainly in desktop C/C++ apps, currently trying to become freelance web developer. 3 months ago I started my intensive (at least to my standards) study of web development with the goal to become ""free"" and work from home, with my own schedule, etc...<p>Since I'm constantly reading that a freelance web developer without online portfolio of websites/apps developed for previous clients is a big No-No, I was wondering how to get away with this chicken-and-egg problem of having no clients <-> having no projects done for clients.<p>My plan so far is to deploy my websites/projects that I'm currently developing (and will develop) to my personal site and use them as a ""fake"" projects with the idea that they are actually ""real-world"". Let me explain a bit about what projects I'm planning to develop:<p>1. E-Commerce site<p>* Features: product catalog (departments, categories), product attributes and images, product reviews and recommendations, admin panel, shopping cart, customer/user accounts, ordering pipeline, credit card transactions (DataCash, Authorize.net), amazon.com web services<p>* Technologies: PHP (from scratch - in order to learn), MySQL (stored procedures), \nSmarty templates, AJAX (shopping cart updates), keyword-rich URLs (from scratch).<p>2. Community site for people with shared interests (let's say books)<p>* PHP + Zend framework (mainly to learn how to develop an app from scratch with Zend), Unit testing (PHPUnit), JavaScipt (jQuery), Web services (amazon, google calendar, youtube)<p>3. Another E-Commerce site<p>* This time developed with Zend Framework for the learning experience<p>4. Custom CMS<p>* Zend Framework<p>5. Music mashup app<p>* Zend Framework, Web services (RSS, amazon, youtube)<p>6. Blogging app<p>* Zend Framework, JavaScript (prototype, scrip.aculo.us), Smarty templates, Image gallery, Google Maps<p>My plan: From these, the #1 (the e-commerce site from scratch) is 2/3 done, I'm learning a ton... With the help of a good friend (and beginner web designer), we'll beautify the site, but we're wondering what kind of e-shop (regarding the types of products) is most suited for a portfolio in order to impress future clients?<p>The million-dollar questions:<p>* What do you guys think of my plan for getting complete applications and experience in my portfolio?<p>* Which of the above projects that I've planned would you scrap, or which would you prefer?<p>* What about Drupal: does it worth it to create a couple of full-featured (a restaurant site, image gallery, job board, etc.) (but still ""fake"") sites with it in order to show that I have these skills. Or generally, developing with Zend+JS as a sort of ""specialization"" will be more viable for my goals?<p>It is essential to NOTE that I plan to start bidding for projects on the freelance site (elance, odesk, etc.) and use my ""fake"" portfolio of home made projects in order to get work.",1304068548

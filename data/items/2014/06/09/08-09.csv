Especially those working for the government.<p>But the modus operandus is standard even for small agencies.<p>You get to bid for a project. If your bid is anywhere near realistic, there&#x27;s no way you&#x27;ll ever get it, because the competition will bid way, way lower.<p>So you put in a bid that you know will never get the project completed and/or will reduce quality well below what will ever be acceptable. However, the contract will be full of loopholes that will allow you to get away with it. You know that once your in, and once the project is far enough along, the client will have no choice but to pay you extra to do what actually needed to be done in the first place.<p>No, the client is not getting screwed. Especially when it comes to governments and major corporations, everyone knows this is going to happen. It&#x27;s just impossible to get the project started for anywhere near the real price tag.<p>But even on a smaller scale, for instance a web agency with a 20K project, if you put in an honest bid you&#x27;ll either never get the job or be forced to build crap.<p>From web shopping carts to bridges, people don&#x27;t value good engineering and planning. Or at least not until they are confronted with the results of bad engineering and planning.<p>So there&#x27;s the original budget and there&#x27;s reality, and an entire cult of rituals surrounding bridging the huge gap between the two. And it is this ritual in which people on both ends take a considerable percentage of the top, so all the decision makers are vested in keeping this ritual going despite all of the well publicized failures.<p>If you are a contractor and you&#x27;re not getting at least 50% more out of a gig than the original contract, you&#x27;re not playing the game very well.",1402304382

In April the government took what its critics charged was a hard-line route. Kei drivers were hit with a triple whammy of a higher sales tax, higher gasoline tax and higher kei car tax, the last of which the government raised by 50 percent, sharply narrowing their tax difference with regular-size vehicles.<p>I feel like there&#x27;s more going on than the article is saying. &quot;industry and government officials are increasingly worried that these microvehicles have become a distraction for the nation’s automakers&quot; sounds like lobbyists for full-size cars feeding politicians what to say.

Smaller cars are not only more affordable (both in terms of original price and fuel efficiency) than normal-sized, let alone &#x27;big&#x27; cars, but they&#x27;re also significantly more practical in crowded conditions, with regards to manoeuvring and parking. They don&#x27;t even necessarily offer less utility than larger cars; they are simply more compact. For these reasons, I think it is likely that smaller vehicles will be adapted in urban centres of developing nations in great number, and they may even gain popularity in developed nations due to their environmental and financial efficiency.<p>If the article in question reports anything even close to the truth, then auto-manufacturers in Japan are making a mistake: they are abandoning their practice precisely when they are really getting their chance to make significant global impact.",1402303767

For example, if they only get caught 1/4 of the time, the fine needs to be greater than four times the amount stolen to make a difference (force the expected value of the behavior below zero). In practice, it would probably need to be quite a bit higher than that since people who do this sort of thing are likely risk-takers/gamblers.<p>So there are then two things you have to guess at. First, how often they get caught (which is difficult, but not impossible to estimate) and second, how far below zero the expected financial payoff must be to change the behavior.<p>You also have to figure out what happens when they don&#x27;t have the money (or the money is well-hidden). Do they just go into some kind of negotiated payment schedule like people who lose lawsuits? That might have no impact at all since their illegal earnings are likely to be hidden from authorities anyway (or can be if needed).<p>This is why I favor prison, because a prison sentence is much harder to &quot;cheat&quot; or nullify. No one lives forever, so prison is like taking a small chunk of a precious commodity away from someone. Additionally, if you are a big earner, prison is actually worse for you in some ways because you generally lose your income while incarcerated. This means that even very rich people or people who hide their wealth from the authorities can be punished effectively with prison time.",1402301992

7867429,comment,7866930,7866930,36,0,phil21,,,"This was what came to immediate mind after reading about ADS-B becoming mandatory in the US a few years back.  This started a small few-month long obsession to understand it all, and became one of my more fun hobbies in the past few years.  It already is mandatory in Europe.  I didn&#x27;t think of the vacationing correlation to stock prices, but simply tracking corporate movements and inferring future stock price movement from those movements.  &quot;Wall Street&quot; of course coming to immediate mind here.<p>For those not aware, ADS-B is essentially a transmitter in aircraft that periodically report registration number, altitude, GPS coordinates, and airspeed.  This is to supplement the current air traffic control system, and eventually take it over.  This data is in real time, and not delayed or censored like the FAA supplied data feeds are.<p>It is not encrypted, so anyone with an antenna and the proper equipment can get the location information of every equipped aircraft within usually a 50-250mi radius, depending on antenna height, receiver quality, topology, etc.  While many US domestic aircraft are not so equipped, this is rapidly changing as I believe all must be by 2022.  Any aircraft that ever enters European airspace must be equipped, so that means for practical purposes any International flight can be tracked.  This includes most corporate jets which are used to fly anywhere but within the United States.<p>It&#x27;s trivial to decode in software, and I run a couple installations with hacked up USB DBS TV dongles.  They are not the highest quality (a few enterprising folks sell custom ASIC/boards for doing this better), but are cheap and easy to make work.<p>It&#x27;s a fun project to hack on for a weekend, I learned a bit about software defined radio among other things.  Even fixed a bug in some code that accidentally calculated the aircraft&#x27;s location to the wrong hemisphere :)  Turns out GPS math is somewhat interesting, in the way they encode the data for the little bandwidth available.<p>This is also the data that powers flightradar24, and probably some other sites out there.  Basically a network of enthusiasts that run antenna installations reporting their data to a central server for visualization.<p>I brought a small antenna and box on vacation with me to Jamaica a couple years back, and was able to track aircraft a good 300nm+ off the coast from the beach.  It was fun watching the tracks route around storms and such.",1402300845

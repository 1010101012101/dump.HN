10193293,comment,10191668,10193126,0,0,geofft,,,"Yes. For instance, say you&#x27;re implementing a red-black tree. In case your algorithms are as rusty as mine are: it&#x27;s a particular form of binary tree where every node has a &quot;color&quot;, red or black, the children of any red node are black, all leaves are black, and the count of black nodes from the root to any leaf (aka the &quot;black-height&quot;) is the same. The intention is that the tree is roughly balanced by following these rules: the minimum height is the black-height (all black nodes), and the maximum height is double the black-height (alternating red and black).<p>You might want to check that the property &quot;the number of black nodes from the root to any leaf is the same&quot; is always valid. With unit testing, you&#x27;d implement the insertion and deletion functions, and write a unit test where you give them a few trees and make sure that the insertion and deletion functions don&#x27;t break that property, probably by looping over every leaf and comparing the black-height. If this passes, you know that your functions are probably correct and at least not <i>obviously</i> broken, but you don&#x27;t know that there isn&#x27;t some edge case you haven&#x27;t thought of.<p>With a language that supports proofs, you&#x27;d tell the compiler about the concept of black-height, and the type of a red-black tree would include the black-height. Therefore, in order to construct a valid red-black tree, you have to have constant black-height. Just as much as you couldn&#x27;t construct a red node with a red child, you can&#x27;t construct a node with two children of varying black-height. When you say that your insertion function returns a red-black tree, as part of type-checking, the compiler makes sure that these properties hold -- because in turn, every helper function you call, every constructor, etc. also requires these properties to hold so that they can return an object of type red-black tree.<p>The downside is that it&#x27;s <i>much</i> more involved than a few randomly-selected test cases to convince the compiler that you&#x27;re upholding the red-black tree rules in every single case. This textbook has an example of doing this in the Coq proof assistant (search for the section labeled &quot;Dependently Typed Red-Black Trees&quot;):<p><a href=""http://adam.chlipala.net/cpdt/html/MoreDep.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://adam.chlipala.net/cpdt/html/MoreDep.html</a>",1441823972

Pretty slick. I might also note, because the NAS & AppleTV are connected to the router by ethernet - not wireless - there is no lag/buffering/etc.",1441823807

Well, the first of the latter Federally was more against the non-wealthy, the 1934 NFA required a $200 &quot;tax&quot;, at minimum $3.5K in 2015 dollars (owning gold was outlawed around the same time, and the people&#x27;s gold confiscated at $20 and change/oz was repriced to $35).<p>However:<p><i>It would be interesting to hear your opinion on Sandy Hooks as well. Many politicians and law enforcement officers had to be silenced and it was a more obvious excuse to pass legislation.</i><p>I&#x27;m not sure what you&#x27;re getting at here, but there&#x27;s always been serious pushback.  E.g. the NFA originally proposed including handguns, and that was zapped in a Congress that was generally giving FDR what he wanted.<p>I believe that the &#x27;70-80s represented the high water mark of gun US control.  Vicious enforcement of the GCA of &#x27;68 was spiked with the FOPA of &#x27;86 (albeit with new machine guns banned to us), the nationwide sweep of concealed carry started with Florida in &#x27;87, the gun grabbers had a lot of fun with &quot;assault weapons&quot; bans, but they&#x27;re now not an issue outside of &quot;communist&quot; states like California and Massachusetts, etc.<p>Pretty much all the 21st Century &quot;progress&quot; in gun control has been in traditionally anti-gun states, even post-Sandy Hook, with the notable exception of Colorado.  And that, and the new angle of laws that ostensibly outlaw temporary sharing and renting of guns, are happening because it&#x27;s a pet cause of billionaire Bloomberg.  Either through initiative in Washington, or the legislature in Oregon, but the rest of the gun control apparat is on life support.<p>However, the <i>Zeitgeist</i> is such that the enforcement authorities are quick to say they won&#x27;t enforce the unconscionable parts of those laws.  So who knows, those Jim Crow laws weren&#x27;t enforced against white until say the &#x27;50s or so, &#x27;60s especially.<p>The situation mostly seems to be in mostly in stasis, with small gains and losses in the various pro- and anti-gun states, the Supremes seem to have decided we only have a right to keep arms, we guess that&#x27;ll be the result of the appeal of <i>Peruta</i> to the 9th Circuit (California and Hawaii), but the 7th Circuit ordered Illinois to go shall issue (!) which they did (!).  Ah, this is still be fought out in D.C., and that might put the Supremes on the spot, we&#x27;re currently winning the courts albeit not on the ground.<p>For the foreseeable future I don&#x27;t see any major changes.  Maybe California will go from iffy to horrible (Jerry Brown is sane here (!)), but much of the rest of the country thinks the state is generally going that way in all areas....  Me, I feel the best I have since way back in the &#x27;70s when the BATF was stamping out gun culture ... through atrocities which resulted in a fierce reaction.  I expect that pattern of attack and counter-attack to continue, and in the meanwhile, Americans have been arming themselves like never before, soaking up pretty much every rifle of military utility available.

And just from personal experience and observation, I have seen friends generate work for themselves (granted, at where they work) simply by being able to code. They would be asked to fix the web site or modify a spreadsheet macro, and they&#x27;d be able to do it.<p>What coding has going for it:<p>1. Coding is higher up the abstraction stack. The higher the safer. Lower would be performing concrete instructions like picking berries or mopping floors. The more abstract the work, the harder it is to be automated. Because...<p>2. Computers can compile but still cannot abstract. Most abstractions embody arbitrary structures external to the computer. So no matter how smart a computer gets, people will still need to communicate these wants. There will always be a place for the translator, and we might as well call this the coder.<p>3. There is still so much room for innovation in the way we choose our abstractions and build our structures. There are human trends, technological trends, and design trends, making software a constantly moving, upgrading, ephemeral target. There is still plenty of potential &quot;disruption&quot; at every scale, and coders can be a part of it. There will always be a place for the architect, aka coder.<p>4. With more services exposing APIs and more programs being scriptable, it is becoming easier for coders to apply themselves in any logistical situation to hook things up and to further automate. This is the plumber, aka coder.<p>Granted, the above is only why coding is comparatively a more useful skill than other skills. Coding can still be extremely hard to acquire for some people. There will always be better coders than you. And, if everyone can code, the skill itself will lose value. So though coding may not be automated like everything else, whether it will save anyone is likely to be a different story entirely.",1441822689

</code></pre>
Well, &#x27;leak&#x27; is one of those things that&#x27;s easy for a programmer to understand, but a hard thing for a computer to understand, because it&#x27;s really about intent. How long did you intend for some resource to live? Any global value is, in some sense, a leak. We had a long discussion about this, and, at least currently, we couldn&#x27;t come up with a formal enough definition of &#x27;leak&#x27; to even start tackling the problem of &quot;how do we solve leaks.&quot; (It is entirely possible that I am unaware about research on this topic... but given that solving leaks wasn&#x27;t a goal of Rust, fixing it would just be gravy anyway. You have to choose your battles, and Rust certainly isn&#x27;t perfect.)<p>As for how safe Rust can leak:<p><pre><code>    let x = Box::new(5);
    std::mem::forget(x);
</code></pre>
which can itself just be implemented in safe code:<p><pre><code>    use std::cell::RefCell;
    use std::rc::Rc;

    fn forget<T>(val: T) {
        struct Foo<T>(T, RefCell<Option<Rc<Foo<T>>>>);
        let x = Rc::new(Foo(val, RefCell::new(None)));
        *x.1.borrow_mut() = Some(x.clone());
    }
</code></pre>

Apple is just slowly re-inventing the Desktop OS (hey look multi-tasking, a keyboard, etc) while MS went full into a hybrid OS over all its lines that can adapt to whatever hardware its installed on. For all the grief MS got for Windows 8, the move it made was ultimately the right one and builds the proper foundation they need for the future. As side note, lets recall about three or four years ago that we were reading, and agreeing with, articles predicting the death of the MS, at the very least, if not WIMP computing in general. Now we&#x27;re sitting here with Windows 10, Surface, etc.  MS did what it needed to do to stop its fall into irrelevancy.<p>I can&#x27;t imagine shelling out near a $1,000+ for this thing (lets price in the keyboard and other accessories) when I can get a proper Macbook or Surface Pro, both which are much more capable. I imagine this will become the next hot executive toy (I need my twitter and my exchange mail up at the same time, nerds!). It&#x27;ll sell in predictable low numbers and then one day mysteriously disappear from the Apple webpage with no fanfare.<p>I feel Apple has painted itself in a corner here. It never bonded OSX and iOS and carefully made them separate products. This probably made sense 5-6 years ago, but unified devices are now practical and affordable.  I suspect Apple has a unified OS ready to go soon and is just buying time with this &quot;Pro&quot; to seem competitive.  I can&#x27;t imagine the status quo lasting. What exactly does a mobile OS get me, especially when it needs hardware and RAM on the level of a desktop OS not too long ago?  Trying to &quot;keep it simple&quot; is what got Nokia and Blackberry killed. I fear that this industry is destined to just re-invent the desktop, but with sexier devices, in the end.<p>I&#x27;m not one to underestimate Apple,  but the past couple years have been underwhelming. Even their much hyped watch is a fairly milquetoast design with a poor value proposition. Or the mobile game has simply matured and there are no more big ideas in this space.

It&#x27;s pretty fundamental to the iOS model (and the Android one) that apps are isolated from each other, so you certainly <i>could</i> have a CLI app that does stuff (ssh, git, vi?) within its own home directory, but can&#x27;t interact with the rest of the system.<p>In fact there are Android apps that do this. It&#x27;s harder on iOS because you don&#x27;t get fork(), but if someone wanted to try super hard, you could make all the apps run as threads within the same process.<p>If you want a <i>root shell</i> without jailbreaking, that&#x27;s almost contradictory.",1441821665

I then explain that design is in the information architecture used to specify the products, the etymology of how the information is structured and the customer interaction and that we need to get that up to back-of-napkin sketch before we need worry ourselves with artistic interpretations of social network buttons.<p>Maybe I go a bit far in not wanting people fiddling with graphic design, I talk of that as &#x27;theming&#x27; or &#x27;styling the frontend&#x27;.",1441821645

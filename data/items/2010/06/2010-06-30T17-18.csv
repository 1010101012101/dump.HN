It was quite okay, but it didn't give me what I was looking for. I want to actually <i>understand</i> what I am doing from the grounds up. For e.g.I wish to understand how TCP/IP works. So, that I know what is happening to my HTTP request after I send it and how I can take advantage of its capabilities. I also wish to understand other things like understanding how an RDBMS is implemented. So, that I can make better code to access data from it more efficiently are also a part of this.<p>In general I want to know <i>why</i> I am doing what I am doing. Some of this knowledge requires years of actual experimentation to gain, and I am ready to do that, but what I am looking for is a good platform from which I can start.<p>Can you suggest any ways/resources to do this?

Either they cost you SaaS money, or they cost you time (as well as infrastructure cost) in learning how to roll your own, deploy it, maintain it, back it up, et cetera. The cost for all of these can quickly add up, and yet if you roll your own, you may be leaving your area of expertise, and you're certainly not focusing on the heart of your own product.<p>Which infrastructure costs (listed above or not) have you decided are worth paying for as opposed to rolling your own, and why?",1277918207

What ultimately counts is experience - mainly from failures. So take my word - kill your urge to make use of pretty looking and so called smart-choice JavaScript plug-ins - they will make your life difficult later on. I just completed an assignment and like always, only used core JavaScript with some help from jQuery to add all event listener place-holders. Tabs, modal dialog, complex form elements and all; I did it on my own. It wasn't more than 4-5 lines of code each, anyway.""<p>That, to me, is the most important part of the article.  Not said nearly enough.  If you have trouble implementing something like tabs in jQuery in under 3 lines you are missing fundamental understanding of front end development techniques.  Front end plugins always lead to a huge lack of customization ability for a very small upfront time saving win (vs. traditional software libraries, which face similar issues but IMO the decision is not nearly as clear cut).",1277918206

1475458,comment,1474094,1474454,0,0,grellas,,,"Great comment. A few thoughts from an older guy on naive assumptions made by younger people:<p>1. That your buddies will always be there in the clutch - many times they won't (a good test: whether they will value your friendship over, say, an opportunistic money grab - many people, in my experience, fail this test).<p>2. That you can succeed with corner-cutting (the easiest way by far to really learn something and to advance is normally the toughest way: to really dive in deeply and master the fundamentals, with hard work, and then to apply what you learned with diligence and hard work to achieve practical outcomes - the ""quick"" way is almost always inferior, though its lure is always there to entice you when you are young).<p>3. That ultimate satisfaction will come from the accumulation of money (nothing wrong with gaining financial success but money in itself can never satisfy the deeper needs of life).<p>4. That you can abuse your body with any form of excess without needing to care about longer-term consequences (big mistake).<p>5. That you can relate to others in a haughty way without consequence. Younger people are prone to have a sense of invincibility about what they can do. Don't presume. We are all frail and fallible. Treat others as you would have them treat you.<p>6. That you need not concern yourself with developing a core center for your character. You can lose everything and still keep your character. In the long run, this is what matters most because it ultimately defines you. Work at making it a good one.",1277917650

If possible identify possibly illnesses based on symptoms, though that would almost certainly have very high rates false positive and false negatives.<p>Hell, you could even go so far as integrating a patient-side application for logging health state: a simple webapp where a patient can go in and report symptoms or general feeling each day. That would make it easier to identify the beginning of symptoms, as well as other illnesses. You should never have to ask the patient how they're feeling at a check-up, because they're likely to forget a lot of things since their last check-up.<p>Disclaimer: I'm tired, this is just stuff off the top of my head, I'm not involved with health care and have no idea whether these ideas would be useful to doctors and nurses.",1301369334

It's an immature camera created by computer people who do not have a sensibility or understanding for the value of high-precision mechanics, which has a 200-year history. It's terrible: Whenever you have to reboot the camera, it takes 4 minutes or so. It drove me insane, because sometimes something is happening and you can't just push the button and record it. An assistant cameraman said this camera would be ideal if we were filming the National Library in Paris, which has been sitting there for centuries. But everything that moves faster than a library is a problem for the RED. Super 35 mm celluloid is still better</i>",1301368507

Just as coffee is a means to an end when you need to stay awake and work, so psychedelics are a means to an end when you are trying to figure yourself and the world out on an emotional level. Just eating them and expecting benefit is fallacious. It's like buying a hammer and being surprised that you don't suddenly have a shed - you need to pick the tool up, apply it to the relevant things and be skilled in how you do so.<p>Personally, I see psychedelics as a compliment to meditation. I would not recommend that anyone trip before they have a solid foundation. If your mind wanders easily, if you cannot look inside yourself, if you cannot sit in silence and be OK with it then you are not ready. Meditate regularly for a year first and then you will be able to reap some real benefit from tripping. Don't pick up a hammer before you know what a nail is. You might hit the wrong thing and end up with a hole in the wall.",1358942244

While it is nice to shuffle around people's skill sets and adapt them to other professions in the short term, in the long run many of those 'skilled' professions will largely be automated too. Even if those workers were capable of acquiring the fabled 'transversal skills' necessary to do the surviving jobs (which many of them most definitely are not), the increase in labor surplus will mean more people will stay permanently jobless.<p>Hence, a more collective ownership of the (automated) means of production is what counts. That sounds awfully marxist though, so good luck trying to convince people of that.<p>I personally would love to believe we're going to end up in a leisure society with a guaranteed minimum income supplemented by some tradeable activities we personally find meaningful (utopia, hooray), it seems more likely we're set for rentier capitalism with a large underclass of jobless vagrants though.",1358941375

I've been working on a computing environment for kids, and I'm super proud with how far it has come.  <a href=""https://clubcompy.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://clubcompy.com</a><p>I think modern machines and languages are far too advanced for the little little kids.  So, I went the old school line-numbered, BASIC language clone route.  I felt that that was the simplest (albeit crudest) approach to getting code into the computer that I've ever experienced.<p>Obviously, I want kids to learn to hack, so does everybody.  But more than that, my angle is that I want the kids to become expert quickly and bump up against the constrained ceiling my language imposes, maybe after a year or two of tinkering.  Then, I want to always dangle something more low level in the system like assembler/byte codes that they can graduate to and use to code more efficient/complex works with.<p>For the hardcore kid hackers, I figure by the time they master my assembler and get some chops, they'll be in high school and be eager to move on to more professional computer languages and Linux.<p>My computing history goes something like this:  I got my start with Commodore 8-bit computers, hooked right away on type-in BASIC game listings in Compute's Gazette.  (I'm still in possession of boxes of issues.)  I was multiplexing sprites with 6510 assembly before I turned 10.  I got my first C compiler, the lovely Microsoft QuickC 2.0, in 8th grade.  Hacked on my dad's Tandy PC clone like a fiend all through high school.  I skipped a year of computer science in college due to my superb AP Pascal test scores, allowing me to graduate in 4 years instead of 5!  Did the artistic thing and joined NovaLogic straight out of college, hacking mostly Intel 32-bit Assembly ... to code their game installers, no less?! (Macho bunch, those dudes.)  Moved on to a systems integrator in SF and have been developing intranet apps with them for over a decade, making a great living.<p>Family, house, cars, career -- I trace it back to BASIC and a mom with the means and foresight to invest some mad money in her little kid's hobby.<p>I don't think my story is all that unique for my generation, we 30-somethings have a quirky computing history.  I do worry about the next generations, however.  Maybe it's just the protective dad in me, but I see less and less hardcore geeks coming up the ranks; what I am seeing are people who lack context, cannot focus, and have little love for the craft.  It's scary.<p>I feel ClubCompy is a calling:  that in order to keep this whole software ball we have rolling, we need to make more hardcore coders.  And don't start teaching them in high school, start in grade school.<p>I would be so honored to give kids a start to their life with computers.  We could raise a generation of coders who are far better than the current crop, and give them their own quirky history to claim as well.  That's my dream, at least.",1358940229

Not in terms of doing your work, but in terms that s/he can make it impossible for you to get your degree<p>-This opens the door for abuse. If your supervisor asks you do to something, even if unrelated to your phd subject, you'll probably do it. If you supervisor is a decent person this won't happen, however if you decide to do a phd you will be in a position where this can happen.<p>2. It's a huge vague task and even if you are extremely successful you will have publications about it with many citations. You'll get some pats on the back, and that's it. There's no real reward. The only reward is relief when you finish.<p>3. If an academic career is your goal, you have to be aware that it is not very rewarding financially.<p>4. Apart from the personal skills that you will most definitely acquire (being able to learn more quickly and in-depth any new subject), the actual knowledge that you acquire from doing a PhD will probably not be useful outside the inevitably narrow subject your phd targets. And unless that subject has demand in the industry, you will only be able to use it in academia.<p>5. Writing scientific papers is not fun, the review process is not fun. I don't think I've met anyone that gets genuinely excited when they have to review or write a paper.<p>I could go on, but let me tell you about the positives. If you can publish, you can travel to conferences, get to know new places and meet interesting people. And that's about it.<p>My personal opinion now (after leaving academics) is that if you really like a subject you should pursue it on your own. The effort that you have to put in a PhD is so big that if you used it for something else, you will probably end up with something that you are really proud of. I say this because when you do research, at least in my personal opinion, you don't always feel you are doing it for yourself, you are doing it because you have to publish, because that's the nature of the game in academics, you have to publish.

5102493,comment,5102115,5102360,3,0,dalke,,,"Where does the argument stop? Why limit yourself to vertebrates, or even animals? Is it cruel to poison an ant nest in your yard? Is it cruel to eat wheat, cut down at the prime of its life? What about corn, which wouldn't exist without human intervention? Is sex with a flower, a plant sex organ, count as bestiality?<p>Humans can empathize with things which aren't humans, and with animals is relatively easy to empathize with pain. The laws are a function of, among other things, our level of empathy with a species and its use for other means. Dogs and cats, beloved by many, take a very special place in our laws, while tasty chickens are less so. Lowly wheat is neutral on the empathy scale, while most are decidedly not fond of roaches.<p>The balance of concerns changes over time. Should some day we be able to synthesize meat directly (""Panda meat while you wait!"" ""Put some tiger in your tummy today!""), then I predict there will be a larger call for ""more ethical"" treatment of animals currently raised for food.<p>The arguments against bestiality vary. Some just think it's squicky, which is likely an aspect of empathy. Others think that in human cultures, sex must be consensual (not rape), by people who can make an informed decision (not children, not unconscious), and without the taint of a power imbalance (boss/employee, teacher/student). Though even then, an adult child having sex with a parent is also squicky by many despite passing these rules.<p>Empathy with animals extends that view to animals, and it's hard to tell if an animal consents, and is not doing so from power imbalance.<p>I am not an ethicist, but I think this gives an outline of the factors by which we tend to say that sex with delicious pigs is a no-no while sex with pretty flowers is odd, but not specifically regulated.",1358939011

There is a Matrix-like quandary in this, in that users who want to filter stop themselves from reaching the point where they see a net-positive outcome.

Defining a &quot;function type&quot; in Java 8 looks like this:<p><pre><code>  interface MyFunctionType {\n    double f(String x, Runnable y, int z);\n  }\n</code></pre>\nThat package merely defines some common types. They are all interchangeable, by the way, so if your method takes a parameter of type &quot;YourFunctionType&quot;, defined so:<p><pre><code>  interface MyFunctionType {\n    double foo(String a, Runnable b, int c);\n  }\n</code></pre>\nThen the same lambda expression could represent both MyFunctionType and YourFunctionType. You don&#x27;t need to use the types defined in that package, you don&#x27;t need to remember what they&#x27;re called etc.<p>> Anyway, they recently started from scratch again on modularization, so pretty much all the work done on Jigsaw before that is lost anyway.<p>I&#x27;m not sure how much is &quot;lost&quot;, but most Java users specifically said, in this case and in others, that they prefer postponing a feature until its been done &quot;right&quot; after die consideration. And when a language is used by millions of developers and with trillions lines of existing code, there is a lot to consider, because a lot is at stake.",1387885717

Not only can, it is doing it right now.<p>So strictly speaking, the US <i>is</i> the bigger evil because it is doing all those things right now, <i>and</i> has the capability of destroying the world through nuclear holocaust.<p>> Again, depends on the people. If Al-Qaida kills 3000 Americans in 9/11, and then Americans kill 10000 Al-Qaida fighters after that, I&#x27;d say good job, they only should have done it earlier, so we would have 3000 less victims.<p>This line of reasoning. This here. That is evil.<p>&quot;Depends on the people&quot;, oh my god.<p>By the way the US has already killed far more than 10,000 in response to the WTC attacks. And not just &quot;fighters&quot; either.<p>And if you still somehow can say this was warranted--I have no (nice) words if you do--ask yourself why they hijacked those planes in the first place. It wasn&#x27;t because &quot;mwuahaha let&#x27;s do something evil against those unfaithful white men dogs&quot; (the hijackers themselves maybe were told something like this, a variation on your &quot;it depends on the people&quot;), but the actual cause was the US&#x27; meddling in the Middle East in earlier decades (during the Gulf Wars and before) that ended up killing <i>their</i> guys. Which made them decide that a mission like this was a completely reasonable response. Someone might have even claimed something ridiculous like &quot;we should have done a 9/11-type attack much earlier, and save all those victims&quot; (which makes about as much sense as your claim that killing 10,000 AQ fighters sooner would somehow have prevented 9/11).<p>They have about as much claim of being the &quot;good guys&quot; as the US.

E.g. look at the quote below, taken from several on inequality:<p>&quot;The second WBG goal of boosting shared\nprosperity is new and opportune. It shifts the focus in\nevaluating economic development from average income\ngrowth to income growth of the bottom 40 percent. Indicators\nproxying the socioeconomic status of the bottom\n40 percent of the population, have shown little improvement,\neven though the growth of incomes of the bottom\n40 percent of the population has not been slower than\nthat of the general population in many countries. This\ngrowing inequality in basic living standards is worrisome&quot;.<p>I don&#x27;t see anything that contradicts the Oxfam report, while there are some comments that seem broadly in line with it. Overall, the broad thrust of both seem in roughly the same direction, although they do take different views.<p>Again the inequalities in income shrinking progressively shown in the interactive presentation is between countries. It looks at incomes below 100k USD, which is not particularly relevant to a debate on the top global 1%.<p>I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a debate to be had on how much inequality restricts growth. Perhaps it&#x27;s not correct when Oxfam says that reducing inequality could improve the overall size of the pie. But I see little in your links to contradict that at first glance.

10922750,comment,10922162,10922615,0,0,mikekchar,,,"As a former English as a Foreign Language teacher, I can assure you that there are always ways to game exams in English.  Because I had to help some of my students get into university, I took a look at the entrance exams.  Even though I am a native English speaker, I found that I could not finish the Todai (top school in Japan) entrance exam for English in the required time.  It required reading and understanding very large amounts of text and then answering difficult multiple choice questions at the end.  Sometimes the questions were difficult to understand and required that you were really careful about concentrating on the wording.<p>So instead, I decided to try again (with a different year&#x27;s test) and instead of reading the material ahead of time, I used the questions to direct my efforts.  I would look at all the answers and then scan the text for areas that talked about those things.  Having identified those, I then looked at the question and ruled out the answers that didn&#x27;t seem related.  Finally I settled on the answers -- mainly by applying grammar rules mechanically (i.e., a wrong answer would be in the wrong tense compared to the supplied text).<p>I was able to complete the exam in time and get full marks.  I had absolutely no idea what the text said.  In fact, I didn&#x27;t even know what half of the questions asked.<p>Now for my dilemma as a teacher.  If my student gets accepted to Todai, it will basically make their life.  You are almost guaranteed to get a good job that will give you the kind of life that most Japanese people are looking for.  If I ask the student to try to do the exam properly, by reading the text, they will fail.  Even I would fail.  I can teach them to pass it in a different way.<p>What should I do?  The test is too difficult.  There are always going to be ways to game it and the successful students do.  Therefore the test gets <i>more</i> difficult and the students are forced to game it even more.  As a teacher, should I tell my student that they can&#x27;t go to Todai, or should I teach them how to game the exam?<p>As far as I was concerned, I decided that teaching English and passing entrance exams were 2 different things.  I taught English for those students who were interested.  I gave up a lot of my free time (a few hours every day) to help them do that.  When exam time came, though, I taught no English at all.  I taught them how to do what they needed to  do to be successful.  Every one of my colleagues did the same thing.  Probably every teacher in the country does the same thing.<p>Standardized tests that grade you and decide your future are insane.",1453096068

Let me explain this by attempting to uncover what I think is the underlying problem.<p>Firstly economic inequality may or may not be a problem, so it is probably not worth talking about. It is only when the inequality manifests itself in terms of  power between people. Were some people have to work for a wage in bad working conditions (even here in the US) because they have no other options. They may have kids. All the way up to: having to work for Google or Facebook et al. and hating it because you know on your free time you would rather explore your own creative ideas. But people who work at menial labor jobs are just as creative and should be given paths to allow them to pursue their creative interests too.<p>Language makes us creative beings, and if power constrains that in any way and it can not make itself legitimate (which the burden is on it to do so) than it is wrong for it to be there.<p>Thus because economic inequality illegimitately constrains the human capacity to express itself creatively it is therefore problamatic and should be dismantled.<p>PS I realize in theory this sounds all good, but I am more convinced that humans can organize themselves into these freer societies.

Crucially, as there are much fewer private schools in France than say the UK or the US, the elite will instead make public superschools and then use connections and districts to put their kids in them (and get the taxpayer to foot the bill), the most famous being Henri IV and Louis le Grand in Paris, but this system applies to all regions (AFAIK).<p>Anecdotal evidence: my &quot;college&quot; or middle school equivalent (which I won&#x27;t name and shame) in Grenoble had a much less interesting canteen. For example, the fries (served with every meal) were undercooked, sometimes still frozen inside, and we occasionally found worms. The queue for food could be as long as 45 minutes, forcing everybody to gulp down their food as fast as they could so as not to be late to the next class. The food was always deep fried meat or equivalents. A decent part of the student population was quite fat, although not to US or UK levels of obesity.<p>France is like the US. You have areas like Manhattan or Santa Monica, and you have areas like North Virginia or Ohio, all with their own history, local funding, civil servants providing wildly differing levels of service. Paris is almost another country (and its residents definitely see &quot;provinciaux&quot; as foreigners), maybe even more so than with London and the UK.<p>For a deep dive down the other end, I recommend the movie &quot;Journee de la Jupe&quot; which gives you a taste of the ZEP schools (arguably the worst in France), it&#x27;s a bit more realistic than &quot;Banlieue 13&quot;.",1453094454

How can one, on a national basis, ensure that every school is affording as equal an opportunity as possible? I&#x27;m not being sarcastic - what is the better alternative, the better metric by which we can gauge the performance of both our students and our teachers? I certainly don&#x27;t think 8th grade math teachers should be penalized for the poor performance of their students if those 7th graders who matriculated into your class on September didn&#x27;t have a functional understanding of fractions. (Conversely, I think teachers who reached &#x27;tenure&#x27;[2] and have clocked out until they&#x27;ve hit that pension-year _should_ be punished). How should those teachers be evaluated? One could suggest &quot;grade the teachers on the improvement of performance of their students compared to their prior years performance&quot; but that brings us back to the same problem -- you have a test. I ask this without snark - how do you test as many concepts at that broad a scope of subject, at that grand a scale (let&#x27;s start small - 3 districts in NY state chosen at random)? How do you even choose what concepts are important at that broad a level?<p>[1] This gets into a whole meta-discussion about what the appropriate methodologies are, which I&#x27;ll leave as an exercise to those doctoral candidates finishing up their dissertations.\n[2] Tenure as I understand it serves to allow researchers could undergo extensive, perhaps subversive, study to enrich the human body of knowledge while retaining job security.

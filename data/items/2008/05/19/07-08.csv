'This has meant not only that Icelandic companies stay and foreign ones come, but that we have increased by 20 per cent our tax revenue owing to increased turnover.'""<p>The article presents a pretty narrative, not a substantive account of different economic theories and their effects, but it does mention both the welfare state policies and the free-market ones, suggesting that choosing the best of both is what has improved Iceland. On the surface this seems sensible to me. The Nordic countries generally have better 'quality of life' than the US does, the US generally is stronger economically.",1211183768

193917,comment,192654,192654,0,0,Mike66,,,"oh man, I stood up at 6 early this morning (CET), turned on my pc to do a really really urgent math assignment, and my python scripts, which I tuned down today to report me only the most urgent things (in the category or a new 11th september or better: of a new 3rd world war) start howling, produce a window before my eyes, obscure the view to the math assignment, report me in blood red capitals: ""NEW ARTICLE BY PAUL GRAHAM! NEW ARTICLE BY PAUL GRAHAM! YESS YESS YESS!!!!"" (all the other python bots, except that one peridically checking PG's hp stayed calm)\nI decided this reigns among the 3 incidents with enough balls to distract me today.  I don't know the exact frequency of PG's essay-releases, but this can't be a coincidence. It was preprogrammed by a higher being, (something like the most general meta-meta-macro) it was a test of willpower whether I really really wanna finish my math studies or not, and I failed. I read this essay tho i had 0 time on my hands. This math assignment might have posed the turning point in my life, and I neglected it in order to read Pauls writing where he explains I shouldn't read things online. Because its so distracting! (Thats interesting: A distracting essay about how to not get distracted.) Fortunately it was short. THANK GOD! So I might survive this somehow.<p>SUMMARY of THOUGHT: PG's has created with his essays one of the deadliest addictions online, worse than TV, games, etc taken together. I hope he feels a bit guilty about it (and about my math assignments too)<p>MiKe",1211183255

This is creating a dangerous backlash.<p>To say that you can't generalize about work ethic and business integrity just shows a lack of experience. Please travel to the rest of the world.<p>The reason our countries are like this is what's been hinted at: Affluency and homogenous cultures. The real test of a society, in my opinion, is what happens when you have to adapt? When diverse groups join or sources of wealth become scarcer.<p>In this regard the American model has really proven itself: Let everyone in, but expect them to make it work for themselves instead of having everything handed to them. (Unfortunately, lately America is preferring the Fort Apache model.)",1211182546

193911,comment,193619,193706,0,0,miked,,,"Over the last several decades I've been reading articles in the US/UK press of the ""it's so glorious to live in Scandanavian welfare state X"". The young whippersnappers that read HN won't remember these, of course. In the past, X was almost always Sweden. In Sweden and other Scandanavian countries there was always plenty of criticism of the US and its racial problems and how they didn't suffer any of those. Then they began to import non-Scandanavians and things changed. Malmo, Sweden now has the highest rape rate in the developed world.<p>Author Bruce Bawer, a political liberal, published a book critical of evangelical Christians years ago and then moved to Norway to marry his partner (they're gay). Here's what he werote a few weeks ago: (<a href=""http://memo.brucebawer.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://memo.brucebawer.com/</a>)\n""During the nine years and two weeks that I've lived in Oslo, I've seen the city change significantly -- for the worse.  I don't remember exactly when it started reminding me of New York in the 1970s and 80s, but by now the resemblance is undeniable.  Burglary, rape, gay-bashing, mugging, graffiti, vandalism: you name it, we've got it in spades, and it's still on the rise.  Public stabbings and gang fights have become routine...The statistics are dire.  Last month came news that the rate of reported crimes in Oslo is now four times that of New York; last week it emerged that Oslo's rape figures reached an all-time high in 2007; today it was reported that over 99 percent of street robberies in the city go unsolved.  To any unblinkered individual who lives here, these statistics are no surprise.  Yet civic authorities, faced with the steady erosion of law and order, exude indifference and ineffectuality.""<p>As for Iceland, it elected a government in the late 1980's that enacted a number of free-market reforms and, by an amazing coincidence, the economy took off. ""Much of the nationâ€™s prosperity is the result of free-market policies, including a 36 percent flat tax on labor income, a 10 percent flat tax on capital income, and a corporate tax rate of just 18 percent (down from 50 percent at the end of the 1980s)."" <a href=""http://www.cato-at-liberty.org/2008/02/21/iceland-and-taiwan-to-slash-corporate-tax-rates/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cato-at-liberty.org/2008/02/21/iceland-and-taiwan...</a>  Amazingly, The Guardian couldn't find space to mention any of that.",1211181988

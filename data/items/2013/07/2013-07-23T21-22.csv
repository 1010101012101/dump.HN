Yes, Go is easier to learn than Java, but certainly not by much (it is, granted, much easier to get a small program running in Go). On the other hand, Java (or Kotlin) are more versatile.<p>Someone once said that easy always wins, and this might be the case with a system level language, too, but maybe when people specifically look for power then easy is not their top priority?

If you leave your car in the sun, it will be extremely hot. But if you leave your car in the shade of a tree it will be ok.<p>You don&#x27;t even need the solar cells, all you need is to create a shade for your house. Something that covers the sun, but still allows air to go through. Trees is probably the best option, if you have the space. Other materials could be some sort of ceramic tiles that rest about 10 cms above the ceiling of the house or use a shade cloth.

Oracle is in this position right now with mysql, for example.

I know that Erlang and Clojure try to solve the problem of writing concurrent code (and fault-tolerant code in Erlang&#x27;s case). Haskell tries to make writing correct code easier. Ruby and Python were made for ease and productivity, and both Ruby and Clojure are great for DSLs. Java and C are used nowadays for performance, and Java is relatively good for architecting huge software systems.<p>What is Scala for? If I&#x27;m hard-pressed to give an answer, I&#x27;d say, &quot;better productivity than Java, in a statically typed language, with good performance&quot;. Now that&#x27;s great, and Kotlin is all that, too.<p>Why the immutable data-structures, then? To make concurrency better? In that case, why is mutability just as easy? And what are implicits and these new cringe-inducing macros for? DSLs? Why would a high-performance, statically typed language make it easy to write DSLs? Is it to introduce developers to the wonderful high-level abstractions of FP? Why all the OOP, then? Oh, it&#x27;s to combine the too; in that case why do they feel so strenuously glued together (classes vs. case classed, an entire collection package replicated twice, once for the mutable case and once for the immutable).<p>So the language offers a powerful compiler but absolutely no guidance on how a program should be written. If at least Scala had somehow provided all of these features and stayed elegant, but man, it would take you weeks just to understand how a freaking Scala collection works, just because the language designers wanted to be so clever and prove that you could transform collections and still never require casts. It seems that at every turn Scala favors cleverness over clarity, and features over a cohesive philosophy. Scala chooses, over and over, to try and address more goals (most are really unimportant), and in the process has lost the most important thing in a language: coherence.<p>Scala sees something nice in another language and immediately adopts it. And I gotta say, writing a compiler that compiles code that&#x27;s both javascript and Haskell is an impressive feat of engineering. But it comes at such high a price...",1374614993

The major benefit is you know exactly when the memory is reclaimed (at zero references). You cannot determine when this will happen in Python (or any other GC language). That&#x27;s all. And, there is no GC pause time in Objective-C&#x27;s runtime so, that&#x27;s awesome too. Another plus of ARC is that the compiler can place the release calls to your releasable instances closer to where they should be and can keep your memory foot print significantly lower, as code would be a lot harder to write with intertwined release calls in the middle of methods. A lot of people like to write their code in a structured form (like, release at the end of a method instead of &#x27;inline&#x27; or &#x27;immediate&#x27;, I hope that makes sense) rather than high performance, due to readability.",1374614989

The author allows himself/herself to freely study and modify the program in its preferred format (the source code), but he/she has intentionally made it impossible for the user to do this. Copyleft is about authors willingly removing the powers granted to them by copyright and &quot;redistributing&quot; them so that all users are granted freedom.<p>It&#x27;s worth noting that the GPL does not say you have to give out source code all the time, you just have to give it out when people ask for it, and you have to make the offer to give it out clear. So the actual issue that you believe is &quot;a limitation on freedom&quot; is the lack of the ability to say no when someone asks for the source code, despite that they have already been distributed a binary.

I might frequently stop by a JCrew while in a mall to look at merchandise, but I might be much more likely to convert if I knew I had a coupon.<p>However, when I am actually at JCrew in a mall, JCrew won&#x27;t have signage with my coupon and won&#x27;t recognize it&#x27;s my birthday.

A garbage collector is a basically a process itself which determines reachability of objects/memory and reclaims that memory if it can determine it is no longer in use. In manual reference counting (ARC also), there is not necessarily such a process. In Objective-C, as soon as an object&#x27;s reference count gets to zero it&#x27;s memory is immediately deallocated. There is no process which searches and marks an object&#x27;s memory to be reclaimed. It would be like calling any other type of manual programatic memory management garbage collection because the programmer handled the garbage.

Consuming lead does not instantly turn someone into a criminal in the way that consuming vitamin C cures scurvy. It affects the childs developing brain, which makes the child duller and more impulsive, which, in some children, and under the right circumstances, leads them to grow up to make short-sighted and risky choices, which, in some children and under the right circumstances, leads them to commit crimes, which, if enough young people act in the same way and at the same time, affects the crime rate. The lead hypothesis correlates the first and last link in this chain, but it would be more convincing if there were evidence about the intervening links. Such correlations should be far stronger than the one they report: presumably most kids with lead are more impulsive, whereas only a minority of impulsive young adults commit crimes. If they are right we should see very strong changes in IQ, school achievement, impulsiveness, childhood 
aggressiveness, lack of conscientiousness (one of the Big Five personality traits) that mirror the trends in lead exposure, with a suitable time delay. Those trends should be much stronger than the time-lagged correlation of lead with crime itself, which is only indirectly related to impulsiveness, an effect that is necessarily diluted by other causes such as policing and incarceration.</i><p><a href=""http://stevenpinker.com/files/pinker/files/pinker_comments_on_lead_removal_and_declining_crime.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stevenpinker.com/files/pinker/files/pinker_comments_o...</a>",1374614465

I&#x27;ve done a <i>lot</i> of &quot;code archaeology&quot; before and some since, and this is the first time I decided a code base was a total loss with no insurance.  So the deadly total rewrite was planned.<p>The business model was &quot;gated open source&quot;, as in paying customers got source, the users were almost without exception system administrators, not programmers, and with one exception who was something of a programmer (at least he did more with the awful code base than any other user) and willing to give it a try, they demanded the &quot;extension&quot; language (actually the complicated business logic) be in Perl ... despite to our knowledge at there were no successful examples of this, whereas Lisp has many, with EMACS and AutoCAD being famous wild successes.  (The whole thing couldn&#x27;t be in Perl because of performance requirements.)<p>Despite being the only programmer working on it and not seriously experienced with Perl, I got overruled.  The CEO, the only manager, was the sort who during this time of decreasing revenue felt compelled to move from Class B to Class A office space (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office#Grading"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office#Grading</a>), and more of it---yet somehow the 3 technical people supporting almost all revenue got allocated only one office, which was tight for 2 people, and I&#x27;m one of those who needs quiet for maximum productivity (the other two were sysadmins and technical support, and had to do a lot of the latter over the phone.  Whine, whine.)<p>Basically, only with maximum productivity on my part was this possible to pull off (and I&#x27;ve done this sort of thing before), as the users were <i>years</i> overdue for real technical fixes and progress (long before I arrived).<p>The board got really upset, the executive director blamed me and they believed her (I after all had been there for less than 2 years and had been able to do only one month of programming in my first year due to Y2K and other sysadmin and tech support demands) ... I had to bail.<p>It was partly my fault, I was not very productive for several months after my major architectural decision was vetoed and that work was dumped, which happened roughly the time the office move made the company&#x27;s financials likely terminal, and I should have outright refused the CEO when she demanded I drop everything to help try to sell more of the old (which her fantasy budget demanded) and pre-sell versions of the new (then again I have to wonder if that would have made any difference).<p>The company died an ugly death, but not before firing in revenge a close friend I&#x27;d hired to do system administration and tech support.<p>Bleah.

It prohibits certain use cases, like distributing that software without its source code. To me, a piece of software is &quot;more free&quot; if its source code is available, but people are still able to do literally anything they want with the source code, including distributing binaries without providing access to the source code. I think the point of the GPL is to utilize the copyright system to ensure access to source code for everyone, <i>not</i> to simply increase freedom.<p>The slavery quip doesn&#x27;t really make sense, because in that analogy the <i>source code</i> is the slave. So unless we&#x27;re talking about increasing freedom for source code (which is a strange notion, since most source code is not conscious) rather than increasing freedom for <i>people</i>, my disagreement still applies. The reason forbidding slavery is not generally considered a decrease in freedom is that both slave owners and slaves are people.",1374614014

6092930,comment,6089984,6092000,2,0,VandyILL,,,"I&#x27;ll probably come back & post more on this later, but one thing to note is that it is not the law schools denying admission to the bar, its the bar denying admission to people who have not gone to law school.  Also, it&#x27;s not illegal to practice law without the education - it&#x27;s illegal to practice without the bar.  The ace card isn&#x27;t really the law schools so much as it&#x27;s the bar associations.  Meanwhile the bar associations are filled with attorneys who have JD&#x27;s and want to keep the value of that degree up, so they have a vested interest in requiring JD&#x27;s for admittance into their profession.  It&#x27;s kinda a circular & self reinforcing system, but like Mark Twain said, every profession is a conspiracy against the world.<p>I think the focus on legal education should not be getting online right now, but to change the JD to a 2 year degree, or start offering LLM&#x27;s or something equivalent without the need for a JD and allow people to practice with those degrees.  I&#x27;ve heard many law professors talk about how the final year of law school is pointless.  Unfortunately, making a JD take 3 years is like Alka-seltzer coming up with the ad where they put in 2 tablets instead of one -- they&#x27;re making money off it because people think it&#x27;s needed.<p>Law schools are over priced, but they&#x27;re also producing more than enough lawyers, so I don&#x27;t really see accessbility as a bottleneck that needs to be solved, which is what most of the MOOCs are solving.  Price is an issue that needs to be solved, but given the self perpetuating old boys network that is the legal profession any changes need to come through slow reforms, not major disruption.<p>Finally, firms & government agencies aren&#x27;t going to hire people with online degrees even if they are admitted.  School&#x27;s name recognition carries more weight than it should (in my opinion) in this profession.  It will be extremely hard for grads to gain the skills and prove themselves when they&#x27;re not able to plug into existing networks after taking an online degree.",1374613994

6092884,comment,6092455,6092755,1,0,ShabbyDoo,,,"In total contrast, I once worked for a staid, rural insurance company where the majority of employees were middle-aged with children.  &quot;Flexible&quot; hours meant that one could arrive at work anytime between 6AM and 9AM.  Clearly, the flexibility was extended to those who wanted to arrive early so that they could be home by the time their children were getting off the school bus.  Twenty-somethings who wanted to venture into the city to see a show (easily an hour drive) still ostensibly had to arrive at work just a few hours after getting home.  These family-friendly policies sent a distinct message to the young/childless -- the company regards your happiness as secondary to that of those with children.<p>Edit: I regard such policy biases as companies&#x27; choices to make, but I doubt that many consider sufficiently the messages these events/policies/etc send to particular employee segments.",1374613500

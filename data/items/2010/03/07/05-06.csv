For a while, I'd been adamant about developing in C and not C++.  One day I discovered that I'd hand-coded a vtable in order to allow polymorphism in structures of function pointers.  The next day, I halved the project complexity by writing 3 classes and changing a flag in the make configuration.<p>I use Gnu make through the Eclipse CDT on Ubuntu.  It's a clunky and ugly toolchain/IDE combo that took days to configure.  It compiles C, C++, CUDA and Brook+ in the same project across 3 different computers.  A better C frontend would be nice, but I do not look forward to getting that working with everyone else in this chain.",1267941551

It&#x27;s really frustrating for me to be on Windows and try to paste the system clipboard into a command line. What is it again? Shift-Insert or Control-Insert? And how do I open a new terminal window? Alt-F2?<p>- The above also goes for Emacs text editing bindings (OS X comes with C-p, C-n, C-k, C-o, C-v, etc.). I want them around too.<p>So being able to rebind keys is really important to me.<p>I&#x27;m also looking to replace a couple apps:<p>- iTerm2.

They weave themselves into the fabric of everyday life until they are indistinguishable from it.&quot;<p>[...]<p>&quot;Such a disappearance is a fundamental consequence not of technology, but of human psychology. Whenever people learn something sufficiently well, they cease to be aware of it. When you look at a street sign, for example, you absorb its information without consciously performing the act of reading.. Computer scientist, economist, and Nobelist Herb Simon calls this phenomenon &quot;compiling&quot;; philosopher Michael Polanyi calls it the &quot;tacit dimension&quot;; psychologist TK Gibson calls it &quot;visual invariants&quot;; philosophers Georg Gadamer and Martin Heidegger call it &quot;the horizon&quot; and the &quot;ready-to-hand&quot;, John Seely Brown at PARC calls it the &quot;periphery&quot;. All say, in essence, that only when things disappear in this way are we freed to use them without thinking and so to focus beyond them on new goals.&quot;<p>-Mark Weiser, The Computer for the 21st Century: <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20141022035044/http://www.ubiq.com/hypertext/weiser/SciAmDraft3.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://web.archive.org/web/20141022035044/http://www.ubiq.c...</a><p>&quot;A good tool is an invisible tool. By invisible, I mean that the tool does not intrude on your consciousness; you focus on the task, not the tool. Eyeglasses are a good tool -- you look at the world, not the eyeglasses. The blind man tapping the cane feels the street, not the cane. Of course, tools are not invisible in themselves, but as part of a context of use.

Rachel disappeared during the sting under watch of LEO and found murdered.  It is similar to charging a &quot;hacker&quot; for scanning websites and cyberstalking (I don&#x27;t know all the charges) then asking that hacker to obtain information on drug cartels and politicians, it is dangerous and unrelated to the underlying crime.  At least in Florida as a result of Hoffman we have enacted Rachel&#x27;s law to protect people in such a situation in the future (but it does not outlaw CIs totally just gives them protection, such as training for officers and right to a lawyer).<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rachel_Hoffman"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rachel_Hoffman</a>",1424351796

9073813,comment,9072566,9073541,0,0,saalweachter,,,"I can think of two reasons.<p>The first reason is that your expenses and income are going to vary considerably year to year.  Maybe your livestock die and you need to purchase new ones / wait for young ones to mature.  Maybe the price of cheese declines.  Maybe the price of feed goes up.  The routine use of loans smooths your expenses over time.  Otherwise, you might have the cash on hand for a good year, but in a &#x27;bad&#x27; year (which might be an every-three-or-five-year thing) you might not.<p>The second is leverage.  Having a money-pile lying around on the off chance 3/4ths of your livestock die is horribly inefficient.  Even just having a money-pile lying around for guaranteed expenses 10 months from now is inefficient.  So you invest it.  As a small businessman, the smartest way to invest it is in your own business, by growing it.  So if you have extra money around, you use it to buy an extra cow or an extra pasture or an extra cheese tank.  These investments are unfortunately illiquid, so you borrow cash against them to pay operating expenses.",1424351767

It seems to me that true self-organization requires a number of very special ingredients that maybe the humankind is yet to discover.<p>Just simply declaring self-organization will lead to more or less disorganization. A disorganized team will not necessarily fail though. It depends on a number of conditions, such as the complexity of the project, the qualifications of the team, time/budget pressure, etc. If the team&#x27;s proficiency greatly exceeds the project&#x27;s complexity, then probably any form of organization will do.<p>A reasonable disorganization is probably what is actually being exploited under the buzzword of so called &#x27;self-organization&#x27;.",1424351430

The &#x27;paper&#x27; - whatever it&#x27;s made of - has texture, and the way the ink sinks into it has depth and texture too.<p>Likewise with traditional printing. The sequence of pages creates a 3D object, and old-fashioned heavy letter press books have texture and depth you won&#x27;t get on a screen.<p>Modern minimalism only became fashionable a century or so ago, which was - coincidentally - around the time artists started experimenting with extreme abstraction.<p>Minimalism has one big problem - it lacks scale-independence. A hand-printed book has visual detail across a range of physical dimensions. You can see the cover across a room, but if you look at the print with a magnifying glass, you&#x27;ll see detail at that scale too.<p>Minimalist digital typography has detail at exactly one dimension - the size of the content. Zoom out, and you can&#x27;t see the content. Zoom in, and you see pixels.<p>It&#x27;s a difference of metaphorical and literal depth. Ignoring scale-dependence robs content of weight.<p>So minimalism is literally shallow. It&#x27;s aesthetic lossy compression - abstraction into illegibility, for the sake of abstraction.<p>You can get away with that in art if you have something interesting to say.

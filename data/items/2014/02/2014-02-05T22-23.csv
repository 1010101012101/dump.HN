This approach can be harmful to compatibility because web content comes to rely upon these vendor-prefixed names. Going forward, instead of enabling a feature by default with a vendor prefix, we will instead keep the (unprefixed) feature behind the “enable experimental web platform features” flag in about:flags until the feature is ready to be enabled by default. Mozilla has already embarked on a similar policy and the W3C CSS WG formed a rough consensus around a complementary policy.<p>I remember people getting worried that app developers might tell users to dig through their about:config equivalent to access the &quot;full version&quot; of this site.  Glad that things are moving away from vendor prefixes.

7187435,comment,7180035,7181819,2,0,gjm11,,,"If you hope to make money from trading (beyond the quite respectable gains you can get just from buying index funds or whatever), you basically have two ways to do it. (1) Make better predictions (or better adjustments for risk, or better hedging of one asset against another, etc.; these are all closely related) than others. (2) Buy and sell without any attempt at predicting the future; be willing to take the other side of any trade anyone wants to make, in return for which you get to buy a little low and sell a little high.<p>For #1 you need quantitative finance. #2 is the activity known as &quot;market making&quot; and HFT is what you get when you automate it and then let the people doing it compete. The algorithms in HFT are pretty simple-minded; the goal is to offer as thin a spread between buying and selling prices as you can while still making a profit, and to offer it faster (when someone comes looking to trade) than anyone else. The latter is genuinely useful when it&#x27;s the difference between (say) 5 minutes and 5 seconds. Unfortunately the same incentives that make it worth while for high-frequency traders to offer sub-second response times then make it worth while for them to keep chasing faster and faster times, until the most important asset a HFT shop has is a bunch of computers positioned slightly closer to a big exchange than anyone else&#x27;s.<p>There&#x27;s not much of what people mostly mean by &quot;quantitative finance&quot; in a typical HFT system, I think.",1391640610

It imposes a high level of guilt and anxiety without providing much in the way of actual useful productive output.

Especially when we are almost ready (as in next week) to launch our own crowdsourced travel advice platform on <a href=""http://www.voyando.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.voyando.com</a>.<p>Let me share what we found during our test period.<p>We have no &#x27;application process&#x27; for experts (flightfox has) which makes the &#x27;crowd&#x27; somewhat smaller. In our experience this removal of the process increases the competition and the chances of a better outcome. Take stackoverflow for example: limiting it only to top-programmers would harm the concept. (i see SO as a crowdsourced programming advice platform :-))<p>Our platform supports more than just flights. We have hotels and complete trips as well. The philosophy of our platform is more on the convenient side of things instead of the &#x27;hacker&#x27; mentality that FF has (no pun intended, FF is great for HN crowd I think). Our service could be used by your mom and dad.<p>Given the fact that we have no selection procedure of experts, a broader range of travel types and aiming to be a convenience service, we are convinced, also looking at our test phase, that crowdsourcing IS the right way to go for us.

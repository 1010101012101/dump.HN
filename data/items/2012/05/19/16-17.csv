3996380,comment,3995811,3995811,40,0,redwood,,,"Little story:<p>So I walk into a bar in Belgrade, Serbia. Turns out to be a private party, lot's of drinking and merry-ment but my girl and I felt a bit out of place. Just before we turned for the door a man pulled me by the shoulder to the bar and started asking what we were doing there, real intimidating-like.<p>He said we could have drinks on him but I felt a little like we didn't want to be indebted to this guy. On the other hand I felt I had no choice.<p>He had asked me what I'd studied and I mentioned physics. He got the bar-tenders attention, got me a drink, and asked me ""so... you say you know something about physics... tell me: 'what nationality was Nikola Tesla?'""<p>I responded ""Croatian"" of course. Suddenly the faces of the man, the bartender, and (so it seemed) the rest of the bar  too went very gloomy, eyes piercing into me like shots of raiki (the liquor they drink).<p>I learned that night that the Serbs claim Tesla was a Serbian who lived in Croatia. The Croatians and Serbs (who hate each other very much) both claim him as their national heros.<p>Lessons:<p>- if you're in Serbia, Tesla was a Serbian (and a god)<p>- if you're in Croatia, Tesla was a Croatian (and a god)<p>- if you're anywhere else, well I guess now I know he wasn't god",1337446773
3996379,comment,3962651,3962651,1,0,chriskolenko,,,"I think the next time I meet a feminist I'm going to punch her in the face and say you're welcome. They sh!t me, and I don't want to discriminate because she's a girl.<p>Why do people think women should be treated exactly the same as men? Soon as people realise biology makes the sexs different we can use this knowledge to our advantage. Women are better than men in ways and men are better than women in ways. In any environment you need to know the strengths and weaknesses of your team to know exactly how to make it run at its full potential.<p>I'm over girls complaining about being discriminated against. If you don't like the pay or the environment you work in leave! You have a choice. It's exactly like watching a bad tv show. There is no point going on twitter or your blog saying how bad it is. You've just given the show 1 viewer plus free marketing. The only way to get the show cancelled is to stop watching. The point I'm trying to make is. Stop trying to make me feel bad for you because I don't. Leave your job until you find one you like with no discrimination and if all the girls who felt discriminated against did this there would be no discrimination.<p>I get discriminated against because of my age. I'm 26 and for the last couple of years I've been a senior developer. It's hard for me to get a job because people think I'm too young for the position. When in fact I've spent more time coding then a 30 year old. Hirers don't count hours after 5pm aparently. I can tell you what I didn't do. I didn't write a blog having a cry over it.<p>One last thing, most of the girls I've meet over the years always say they want to be treated like men. But why do they get so happy when you open a door for them? No chick has ever opened my door. It just seems like they want the best of both worlds.",1337446759

3996327,comment,3993649,3993649,5,0,adamschoales,,,"Here's the thing. I loved the Talk Show for the longest time, but even recently noticed that things were starting to... go downhill. Never would have guessed it was between the hosts but the magic wasn't there anymore. It seemed more like a chore. I missed the Bond stuff a lot, and was looking forward to the potential next movie club but it never happened. And then things just seemed to become more and more pauses and more and more wasted hours.<p>Another thing: Gruber's a terrible host. Don't get me wrong, I think the man is great, his blog fantastic, a magnificent writer, and a really smart guy. But his constant pauses, breaks, and seeming unwillingness to be on a show doesn't make for good listening. Which is why Dan was KEY to the show. Having him to help guide the conversation, reel Gruber back in, and most importantly, feed him the softballs so Gruber could knock them out of the park was KEY to the success of the show.<p>I just don't understand how Gruber can expect to do the show without him. Now maybe if part of this was because of bad blood, and Gruber is joined by his friends it won't matter, he will WANT to talk to them and it wont be an issue. But I don't know.<p>All in all, I'm not sure I'm going to keep listening. Gruber & Friends only interests me if the friends are the aforementioned Lonely Sandwich, or Merlin, or other guys who's shows and insight I've come to know and love.<p>As for the reasoning? Your guess is as good as mine, and I think people are right in assuming it's bad blood otherwise an official statement should have come from someone. To be fair, as respect to the fans and people who listen one, if not both should have said something (Leo Laporte is very open when his shows/hosts move on) because it's the professional thing to do. If the split is personal not professional the silence makes more sense. That said, these guys make themselves out to be professional so even if it <i>was</i> personal they should still have come out an said something (again, see Laporte).<p>One thing is for certain. Listen to Dan's back and forth with hosts like Siracusa, Dalrymple, and of course Merlin Mann. Merlin <i>signs off</i> with an ""I Love You"" and you can tell there's a genuine friendship amongst that professional relationship. Gruber and Dan never had that, so maybe its for the best they go their separate ways.<p>But for both to say nothing to anyone is a big Screw You to the fans (note I only used screw to be polite, I would have opted for the harsher option), and doesn't leave me wanting to hear Talk Show 3.0.<p>I'll still read Daring Fireball religiously though.",1337445438

The only other significant spec is the radiation shielding, but we know how to do that; again, it's just a matter of engineering and cost, not science.<p>The big change in the Gen3 specs is the required 1g acceleration, which is probably too high for ion thrusters to reach based on our current knowledge. So we would need to do some development on nuclear rockets; but there has been scientific work done on fission and fusion rocket concepts, so even here it's mostly engineering and cost.

Theoretical predictions, confirmed experimentally, such as the violation of Bell inequalities, point to an affirmative answer. However, these results are based on the assumption that measurement settings can be chosen freely at random, ..."" [1]<p>From its inception, quantum mechanics has used the language of probability to make calculations (this is the ""Born rule"" that another poster refers to), but this does not mean that the universe behaves randomly. Perhaps, as you suggest, this language of probability conceals human ignorance. To test this, we define a physical property called ""realism"" that says, roughly, ""every experiment has a result that was knowable beforehand"". If realism does not hold, then the results of some physical experiments are somehow randomly determined at the moment that the experiments are performed. A set of famous experiments (the ""Bell's inequality experiments"" [2]) have shown that, with certain assumptions, ""local realism"" does not hold, i.e. locality and realism do not simultaneously hold. Locality is the idea that it is possible to perform two experiments in sufficiently separated regions of the universe so that they cannot possibly influence each other. If general relativity were a complete theory, for instance, then we would have locality (because no signal could travel faster than light).<p>Almost all non-specialist physicists (physicists who <i>use</i> quantum mechanics but do not spend time trying to assess its foundations) accept locality and accept that the Bell experiments rule-out local realism. This means that they give-up realism, and these physicists say that nature is ""fundamentally random"". Some physicists try to give-up locality instead, and you will hear them talk about ""non-local hidden variable theories"". Other physicists, such as the authors of the linked-to ""Nature"" article, play carefully with the assumptions behind using the Bell experiments to rule-out local realism. For instance, they point-out the assumption that ""measurement settings can be chosen freely at random"". If this assumption does not hold, neither does Bell's proof.<p>All-in-all you are in excellent company if you say that physical processes are fundamentally random, but there are many specialist physicists who grapple with this question in their daily work.<p>[1] <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1105.3195"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/abs/1105.3195</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_test_experiments"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_test_experiments</a>",1337444243

3996261,comment,3995574,3996180,3,0,ralfn,,,"Well, answer me this:<p>Whats the order of complexity of adding an element in the middle of ""an array"" in PHP?<p>So, it's bad, because it makes it very confusing, what the exact implementation is. If you can't tell how much slower your algorithm that calculates something from an 'frankenarray' gets, when the array gets bigger, you have a problem.<p>That's one problem. The other problem is with language itself. When we call something an array, which isn't actually an array (an array being a very specific implementation of a vector) people get confused.<p>Imagine how you would feel if PHP used the word 'variable' to mean function and the word 'function' to mean variable.<p>So, a hash and an array are not just semantically different (that they refer to a completely different ADT's), but they are also completely distinct implementations of those ADT's.<p>Now, this is not a problem, when you are using PHP as it was originally intended. To add a small bit of logic to a template that mostly uses fast, well written c functions in it's built-in library.<p>But people are abusing PHP to write large scale libraries and frameworks. Many riddled with security issues, and unpredictable performance bottlenecks, because the language wasn't designed to actually allow you to write well defined algorithms.<p>Now, we've seen workarounds for these problems. Facebook wrote a PHP to C compiler, and moved all crucial algorithms to C. You can use unit-testing to supplement the lack of any usable type information, and to combat the automatic casting that PHP does (which creates all kinds of bugs in edge cases, that is hard to track or test against). You can use profiling to track performance issues, and fix code that interacts with frankenarrays, in a sort of trail-and-error kind of way.<p>People once wrote all their code in ASM. Discipline can make all the difference. But highly skilled disciplined, well educated professionals aren't the target audience of PHP.<p>All this required discipline can be justified on practical grounds. PHP programmers are generally paid the worst (or as  an employer would call, are the cheapest). Hosting is cheap.  And for many use-cases you can just drop in ready to go code (Wordpress, Drupal, Joombla, etc.) and just skin it.<p>So, i'm not saying picking PHP is a bad financial choice for a company. If you don't take on difficult projects, and don't intent to hire highly skilled coders, it can be cheap and productive.<p>But that doesn't make the language any better..",1337444028

And even if an entrepreneur can create a whole new market on their own by innovating, it will soon become customer driven.<p>I am betting on the theory that entrepreneurship itself provides much more space for creativity than <i>most</i> other professions and if you succeed, you'll have a lot of money and time to pursue creativity full time. I have also read about a lot of successful entrepreneurs who discovered that they really need a startup to give direction to their creativity. Thus, serial entrepreneurs are born.<p>pg is one of the few entrepreneurs I can think of who didn't become a serial entrepreneur in the traditional meaning of the word but still found great outlets for their creativity. Although, at least one of pg's outlets - YCombinator <i>can</i> be thought of as a startup.",1235505523

Likewise, sometimes really solid players get signed quite cheap.<p>So it goes with acquisitions too: Sometimes an acquirer falls in love with a company or sees value they can add quickly and pays way more than people would expect. Sometimes a company needs to sell now and sells at a bargain. It can still be worthwhile to try to peg values on companies, but final sale prices usually will differ greatly.",1235505502

But I maintain that my responses could all have been comfortably delivered in person, as an individual.<p>A few important points/questions:<p>- Was I acting as an individual or as an employee of Facebook? This is a very difficult question. We set up and publicized numerous official channels for user feedback on the new profile. Of course, we would never respond in this manner through those channels. These individuals all elected not to use those channels and instead sent personal messages to my individual Facebook account. I understand that this will still largely be viewed as acting on behalf of the company, but I think the question of context is a very important one. Where do we draw the line between personal use of Facebook, and use as an employee? Was I interacting with customers or individuals?<p>- I didn't violate any data privacy. These people sent personal messages to my Facebook account, which granted me permission to view their profiles (as natrius correctly pointed out).<p>- In the note I posted, I removed the last names of everyone who messaged me. David, Carissa, and Derek are hardly unique identifiers.<p>- These were all blatant cases of hate mail. I'm not a lawyer, but some of these would likely have held up in court as charges of assault. Characterizing any of these as a ""feature request / bug report"" is honestly quite a stretch.",1235505004

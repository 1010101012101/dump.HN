The remaining 1% presents a few facts:<p>1)  Clinical trials are currently considered necessary to prove drugs work.<p>2)  Some people think the clinical trials are cruel to the control group.<p>...  That's it.  Here's a genius quote:<p>-- Some melanoma specialists familiar with the drug would have traded the data for faster access to the drug. “I know all that I need to know based on the results we already have,” said Dr. Keith Flaherty of Massachusetts General Hospital, who led the early clinical testing. “My use of this drug is not going to be informed by testing it against a drug we all hate and would rather never give a dose of again in our lives.” --<p>So, he saw some initial results, but not enough to be conclusive to any objective observer.  That was enough to make his mind up.  He doesn't care to follow science because he -believes- the drug will work now.<p>Thank goodness he's not -my- doctor.<p>I don't disagree about the cruelty of putting people in the control group.  You're basically denying them medicine that they need.  But we don't have an alternative at the moment.<p>It's also worth remembering that everyone that goes into a study like this is told that they have a 50/50 chance of not getting the medicine.  They KNOW this going in.  They choose to take that chance because their current medicine isn't doing the job...  Or whatever other reasons they have.  Getting upset that got into the wrong 50% is pointless.  That was part of the deal.<p>And finally:  How does he KNOW he's in the control group?  Maybe the medicine simply doesn't work on him.  Even the doctor wouldn't know if this were a double-blind test.",1284904642

1706121,comment,1699620,1704538,0,0,loup-vaillant,,,"The reason you deserve to have access to the code you run is because it's the only way for you to trust it.  Code you don't have access to has a tendency to betray you with various ""features"" (spying, arbitrary limitations…), that just wouldn't be there if you had access to the code.  In my view, resorting  to state violence to prevent such treason is perfectly justified.<p>What you call ""purer freedom"" is actually negative freedom, which is about not forbidding. The GPL promotes positive freedom, which is about enabling.  As we can see when we compare the GPL and permissive licences, the GPL is more effective at enabling everyone to look at the source code.  For me, that's what counts.  I don't care about how ""pure"" the freedom is, I just care about it's effectiveness.<p>Lastly, you said <i>""Free software […] is incompatible with privacy and property rights""</i>.  ""Privacy"" was appropriately used, but I think you tossed ""property"" without much thought, using its positive and undeniable aura.",1284904357
1706120,comment,1705771,1705771,0,0,cletus,,,"I don't buy this at all.<p>Apple has always been a hardware and software company with a very specific philosophy about user experience being everything. The digital music revolution gave Steve Jobs the opening to create the iPod that basically resurrected the company. That ply has been extended into phones and mobile computing.<p>Google is (from a revenue perspective) a search and advertising company. Their business model is predicated on how much you use the internet. So what Google is concerned with is everything between you and the internet. They've done Chrome, Android, etc to commoditize every link in that chain. Everything they do is about you using the internet easier, cheaper, in more places or more often.<p>Microsoft is about one thing and one thing only: selling Windows and Office licenses to enterprise and OEM customers. Nothing else matters. Look at the Kin: they bought Danger (with its once successful Sidekick) but then spent the better part of two years rewriting its OS as some Frankenstein version of Windows mobile. It arrived way too late and was dead before the first unit was sold (in large part due to the enormous data costs that Verizon saddled it with as they'd lost patience with the delay). Windows Phone 7 has the same goals.<p>Facebook is all about capturing and cultivating your relationships. They are a silo. They want to own that data because that data is their business and their entire value. Integration with everything else is about allowing other people to give Facebook more data.<p>What sense does a mobile platform make in that context? Absolutely none that I can see. How does it let them capture and control more data? Apple has had huge success with the iPhone because they have the industrial design, UI experience, supply chain management (which shouldn't be underestimated), iTunes (as much as many--including me--hate the application it is a near-monopoly in digital content) and retail channel.<p>For Facebook to succeed in the mobile space they would need most if not all of these things. It's a huge risk for relatively little gain and a small payoff. I can only thing that by leveraging a mobile platform of their own they could essentially lock out other platforms. The problem is that Facebook is usable with any Web browser.<p>I can't imagine Facebook doing any more than controlling the Facebook experience on all mobile platforms, an area they're still sadly lacking in (iPad app anyone?).<p>Basically this makes as much sense as Twitter making a mobile phone.",1284904343

But I am reminded of a personal anecdote:<p>In my mid-twenties, I had to have minor surgery on my face.  My looks were very important to me. I thought I was quite beautiful and this was upsetting to me. I was concerned I would be disfigured but I really had to have the surgery.  Trying to make my peace with it, I commented ""I guess I can always have cosmetic surgery later.""  The surgeon was quite affronted and said ""You won't need cosmetic surgery when I am done.""  The scar is nearly invisible -- less visible than the cyst that was removed.  Even people who knew me before the surgery and know I had my face cut on have difficulty finding the scar.<p>I concluded that if you can bring it, maybe you aren't actually arrogant.  Maybe you are just stating the facts, regardless of how it might sound to other people.",1284904307

In fact, classic Kanner's syndrome (the original autism) generally also means severe mental retardation.  Other people are labeled ""high functioning autistic"" (also called ""Asperger's Syndrome"") and can be very intelligent but have some challenges in areas like social skills.  Still, most their social difficulties are, essentially, a form of being mentally challenged.  Though there are some exceptions.  For example, the folks who are also faceblind (fairly common among autistics) face social challenges due to their difficulties recognizing people, which is different from just not understanding the social stuff but has a similar outcome.<p>(Both my kids fit the profile for ASD.  No formal diagnosis.)",1284902646

In one sense, of course, there is nothing new under the sun.

Sometimes I'll get both a song and a word repeating in separate loops at the same time! I think it's a similar mechanism though, it's a lack of closure.  I believe they repeat because my brain is looking for connections, or trying to learn something from it. The annoying ones are when I can't remember the ending of a song, so the middle keeps looping over and over.  Or if I can't quite remember the definition of a word, very annoying.

The best performance can be obtained by:<p>Idea(s)\nPlan(s)\nAction(s)<p>Of course, the trick is to know when to switch from one to the other.  Generally, I like to take an idea (or ideas) and think about them for a while.  When I feel vaguely comfortable that there are no obvious roadblocks, start planning.  When I'm vaguely comfortable there are no subtle roadblocks, it's time for action.  If you hit a roadblock, it's back to the ideas phase.<p>This strategy keeps you moving forward, bring fresh information quickly, and avoids most roadblocks before they waste any time.<p>Depending on the scope of the idea, the planning could be anywhere from minutes to days.  Scope and complexity also change whether the planning happens purely in my head, or requires some typing to get everything clear.<p>Luckily, life usually gives us ideas while we're working on something else, so there's time to think about an idea for a while before you even have time to take action, which gives some planning time.",1284902353

If a bank gets really bad, people will switch (I think it'd have to get really bad, since switching seems overly painful for me personally - then again, I'm Canadian and our banks work a bit differently than in the states). If all the banks suck - or at least, as you say, the ""big banks"" who obviously have the biggest mind share - then people just sort of put up with it.<p>The same goes for airlines. If you're in the position where you're considering flying, pretty much all of your options suck anyway. By this, I mean that if I didn't fly home (a two hour flight), my next best option is to travel by train, which is comparable in price, takes 10x more of my time, and is (warning: unsourced memory of something I may have misread) actually les safe than flying.

Their sales are pretty decent IIRC, and they're growing.<p>My point here is that there are already three large, established names that can compete ""on name alone."" The Facebook name, in a lot of circles, doesn't have a great reputation, particularly when talking about privacy.<p>I'm sure there <i>are</i> people out there who would buy a Facebook phone purely based on the name, but there are an awful lot who would do the opposite.

I haven't played around with it to see how it handles motion, but I know with DivX/WMV that's always been a big problem. I can't imagine watching an action movie in compressed 720p is going to be anywhere near as good as uncompressed 1080p, but then I also can't imagine most people will know or care about the difference.",1200532739

The massive inefficiency of people (in cities like Chicago, Los Angeles, etc.) wasting 2-3 hours per day sitting in their car going 5 miles per hour is astounding.<p>If the highway system were not held back by government planning, much of this inefficiency and waste could be eliminated, and reallocated into productive pursuits.  Imagine if 80% of a city's' commuting professionals had two hours more per day to spend money on things (or to work more).<p>It's easy to assume that highways are one aspect of central planning that works, but in urban, congested areas they are a disaster that hits the poor the hardest.<p>Also, by making it seem ""feasible"" to live in suburbia and commute into the city, they led many middle class workers to flee cities, eroding the tax base, and causing the decay of city governments/services, etc.<p>Everything has tradeoffs.

(OK, I'm simplifying a bit, you do a favor to your body and that will benefit you; but I'd aim for a broader point of view).<p>By working at the building site, for example, you train your body and your mind to respond in constantly changing situations. I don't know if something like ""muscle memory"" has a proper scientific background, but I strongly believe there's something in it. You have to focus, you have to be careful, do things in the right moment, be aware what's going on around, have some introspection of your strength - what you can do and what can't. Whether it is laying concrete or making a wooden roof, the kind of awareness needed is pretty much similar. Plus you spend a lots of time in the fresh air inevitably (at the building site there's no building <i>yet</i>, right? :) which is IMO crucial.<p>From what I saw the most rewarding physical job I can imagine is to help someone with the carpentry, esp. making roofs. The wood is so beautiful.<p>There's also one feature of physical work I'm personally very fond of: you usually see direct effects of what you've done very quickly. This is in a big contrast to modern coding, where there are so many layers of abstraction and inter-dependency, we sometimes build stuff months and to the very end we don't know if it really succeeded or not.

One of the biggest reasons why the trees need to do this is because when a tree gets attacked by a disease in the spring or early summer, it ends up losing most of its leaves before the fall. Because of this it hasn't yet stored up enough energy to survive the winter, so the tree is likely to either die or else be seriously weakened, and it will definitely die if the same thing happens the next year. The mycorrhizal networks can warn of advance attacks, transmit enough energy to get the tree through the winter if a tree has already succumbed, and maybe even transmit some sort of antibodies as well. The kicker? Most of these tree diseases are other funguses. So the whole thing is really some kind of slow motion LOTR-style epic battle.",1313336546

There's a common misconception that the proposed ""Internet kill switch"" would allow the executive to order ISPs to turn off access in exceptional circumstances. This is false. What is proposed is an authority given to the executive to preemptively pardon any ISP (or other service) that chooses to disable service, and excuse them from liability for whatever damages. This would allow ISPs to react more forcefully to major cyberattacks.<p>The idea is still of arguable merit, but the proposed mechanism doesn't do the government any good unless ISPs have their own reasons for wanting to turn off service. The idea is to remove unwanted disincentives for them to do so, not to force them to do so.<p>(Everything else you said is quite true.)",1313334858

2883802,story,,,8,10,HN-regular,"Ask HN: Is freelance statistics/machine-learning consulting viable?",,"I'd love to hear from anyone who's making a living as a freelance statistics/machine-learning consultant, as I'm thinking of going this way myself and wondering whether it makes sense.  I prefer to do Bayesian data analysis, but I'll turn to whatever tool seems to fit the job at hand.  I have a lot of experience in scientific programming, not so much with industrial-scale software development (though I've read <i>Code Complete</i> and try to follow its main principles to the extent that they make sense for my relatively simple programs.)  I have a comfortable job in academia (not tenured) but for a variety of reasons I see hard times just over the horizon for the field of research I specialize in, and I'm looking around for what's going to come next.  I'm finding it surprisingly easy to interview for statistics/machine-learning type jobs at technology startups and I was thinking, these guys really want my skills, so why hitch my wagon to just one company when I could sell my services directly?  One thing I love about my current job is the autonomy and independence, and it would be great to preserve that.  And I don't really want to start a startup at this stage, because I don't want to have to do all the other work associated with that.  A consultancy seems like a nice balance, at least for now.  I know it will involve marketing, networking and collections, but that seems manageable.<p>So I am looking for evidence that this is a feasible approach.  Are companies interested in bringing in outside consultants to help solve statistics or machine-learning problems?  It's a complete guess, but the main problem I forsee is that ideal solutions usually come from a fairly close examination of the patterns in the target data, and if that data is sensitive there might be barriers to sharing it with outsiders.  I'm also curious about terms of the consulting gigs: how do you decide on the price and the criteria by which you'll be judged to have successfully completed the project?  Also, it would be interesting to know the extent to which customers accept remote collaboration, as I don't live in a major metropolitan area, and kind of like it that way, though I would be happy to travel in order to set up the deals.",1313334744

2883787,comment,2882777,2883245,23,0,briggsbio,,,"Actually overall, in vivo animal testing on vaccines, antivirals, and antibiotics are typically quite predictive from animals to humans. These types of tests are not historically very predictive when moving from in vitro to in vivo animal studies, however. This is typically because the treatments and vaccines are structural and/or expression-based (exploit a bacterial surface protein and poke holes in the cell, use a virus to get into T-cells and inject genetic material to let them identify and kill polio, etc). (yes, oversimplified). But moving from cell culture to a living organism This doesnt always work out. If it does, then it's relatively easy to confirm the effect if it works in animals to humans (virus is gone/never infects, etc). So more antibiotics and vaccines fail from in vitro to in vivo than from animal to human data.<p>In treating diseases of inflammation, rheumatic disease, pain, etc., it is generally quite predictive when moving from in vitro to in vivo animal studies (e.g. is it down-regulating inflammatory transcription factor NF-kB, or not?). But it becomes much less predictive translating endpoints  from animals to humans. That's, very generally, because it is difficult to assess disease measures of improvement in inflammation in animals and translate that to humans (pain, discomfort, edema, these processes may present much differently in rats versus humans, for example). Great animal data may not mean you'll get such a strong effect in human subjects, and thus the failure rate for these drugs in clinical studies is quite high compared to vaccine and antibiotic human trials, because those vaccines were shown to be ineffective earlier in development.\nThis was a very general explanation, to be sure, and I'll dig through my archives for some papers on this and try to add links later.",1313334282

If people were willing to be spontaneously cooperative even if it meant a cost to themselves, this would catapult us into a system of stable cooperation in which everyone profits. Think peace, harmony, Lennon's ""Imagine"" playing as the credits roll. But people aren't willing to do this. Establish instead a setting in which people can incur costs to themselves by punishing cheaters, in which the punishing doesn't bring them any direct benefit or lead to any direct civic good--and they jump at the chance. And then, indirectly, an atmosphere of stable cooperation just happens to emerge from a rather negative emotion: desire for revenge. And this finding is particularly interesting, given how many of our societal unpleasantries--perpetrated by the jerk who cuts you off in traffic on the crowded freeway, the geek who concocts the next fifteen-minutes-of-fame computer virus--are one-shot, perfect-stranger interactions.</i>",1313334166

8008980,comment,8008634,8008948,2,0,robert_tweed,,,"The problem with that is that it doesn&#x27;t work when you have code (and comments) formatted in neat columns. Since plain text doesn&#x27;t have any portable way to handle tabstops, everything has to be padded out (after the initial indent) with extra spaces. Characters must have equal widths or nothing lines up properly.<p>This is pretty common in long repetitious declaration blocks, at least when the code is written by someone that cares about formatting. It vastly improves readability. Example:<p><pre><code>   int   some_variable     = 100;     // Foo\n   float another_variable  = 1000.0;  // Bar\n</code></pre>\nThe gofmt tool actually does this kind of column formatting automatically.",1404903462

8008977,comment,8008083,8008721,3,0,dalke,,,"It appears that DanBC has found an agreeable place, with the expectation that certain laws and prohibitions, both cultural and legal, are in place. Should the neighbors decide to start a jackhammer testing facility, and ignore DanBC&#x27;s requests to stop making such a racket between 11pm and 6 am, I don&#x27;t think the obligation should be on DanBC to move.<p>I see you structured this as an ownership issue. The issue is that certain things leak outside of what one owns. This includes sound, light, odor, and access to shared space. How are these resolved? Combat, private courts (as, for example, in medieval Iceland), public courts (civil in this case), and various other dispute resolution systems exist.<p>Nearly all of them, including duels, depend on a system of laws. Take the Icelandic Commonwealth as an example of a society with no government, and where everything was privately owned. Even then, there was a set of laws, and the role of the lögsögumaðr was to act as counselor and to recite the laws at the Alþingi so that everyone would know what they are. If there was a serious problem that couldn&#x27;t be resolved locally, it was handled by the Alþingi, as many of the sagas describe.<p>Also, as DanBC is part of society, your first phrase is odd - it&#x27;s shifting the burden <i>within</i> society not <i>to</i> society, and shifting it to a dispute resolution system which has been developed to handle precisely these issues. Similarly, I&#x27;ve shifted my water acquisition burden nearly completely to society.",1404903364

It gets worse with Dependency Injection,</i><p>This seems far-fetched to me and doesn&#x27;t have much to do with readability anymore. Moreover most of the time this is imo how code <i>should</i> be. If you start programming with readability in mind and as such start throwing away standard design practices because they lead to one more click or less readability, you are doing it wrong. That comes dangerously close to using copy-paste instead of a function because it is clearer since you can see the implementation directly. I&#x27;d argue that you should not have to figure out what the implementation is. That&#x27;s the whole point of using interfaces (and dependency injection for that matter) - if you have to figure out what implementation used then you are either the implementer or the code is wrong somehow, like it is violating substitution/dependency inversion principles. Or you are studying the code in-depth, in which case you have to go through all implementations anyway. Calling all that &#x27;readability problems&#x27; is a bridge too far.",1404903157

8008947,comment,8008204,8008204,3,0,konzi,,,"I would love to have a list of tasks for each of my patients on my phone. This would make being an intern far easier. In fact, I&#x27;m currently validating and building a solution for this exact problem, which I will talk about below, but first it&#x27;s important to understand what an intern (at least here in Australia) does during the actual ward round where most of their tasks for the rest of the day are created.<p>An average intern during a ward round has to do the following things for each patient :\n1) Handwrite notes into the patient&#x27;s bedside notes as the senior doctor takes a history / examines the patient.\n2) Look at the patient&#x27;s vitals chart and medications chart.\n3) Handwrite a plan in the patient&#x27;s notes at the end (this is essentially a list of tasks for the intern to do during the day).\n4) Often while the intern is still writing the plan, into the patients notes, the rest of the team is already moving onto the next patient. The intern will hurriedly re-write any tasks from the plan onto their personal printed patient list (takes < 5 seconds) and then quickly go get the notes for the next patient and begin this process again. Also note that often the patients are scattered around multiple wards in the hospital.<p>Now Listrunner, in their demo video shows a list of tasks for each patient on an iPhone. Awesome!<p>But where in the ward round does my list of tasks get copied into Listrunner? If I have to manually find the patient in the app and then manually add the tasks to an app it would take minutes, not the <5 seconds it does to rewrite the tasks on a personal list in super shorthand. And no senior doctor is going to wait a couple of minutes for you to write each patients tasks into your phone (this would add 40 minutes to a 20 patient ward round).<p>I&#x27;ve been thinking about this a lot, and I think a solution using google glass would be super amazing here. I&#x27;m currently in the prototyping and validation stage of the project (following Eric Reis&#x27; &#x27;build-measure-learn&#x27;). Happy to talk to any doctors interested in it.<p>It works as follows:<p>1) After you finish writing the patient&#x27;s plan you take a photo of it with google glass.\n2) OCR is performed on the photo, right then an there (hopefully in <= 1 sec) and the OCR is shown to the google glass wearer who can confirm that the OCR is correct.*\n3) Those tasks are then synced to the doctor&#x27;s phone, or for security reasons perhaps a hospital owned phone or tablet.<p>The advantage of this system is that it doesn&#x27;t change the current workflow at all. It doesn&#x27;t affect the speed of the ward round. Thus, faces a lower level of resistance to adoption.<p>Disadvantage - doctor&#x27;s are notorious for bad handwriting, thus it will not work for all doctors. It&#x27;s expensive. However, as google glass (and perhaps other similar tech) gets cheaper this may not be significant.<p>*Patient labels are already affixed to the top of the page (so OCR can be performed on the label to associate the tasks with the patient). But if the solution became widely used, a simple QR code could be added to patient labels, to make this easier.",1404902555

We launched (semi-officially) some time in January and we&#x27;re currently a team of two: myself (I made the first version) and my friend (joined me in March to help on the engineering front).<p>Here&#x27;s a couple of examples of what you can make with Sprites:<p>- &quot;Dubai Airport&quot;, https://spritesapp.com/view/embed/1825<p>- &quot;Time on Internet&quot;, https://spritesapp.com/view/embed/3384<p>- (more examples can be found here: https://spritesapp.com/examples).<p>Visit us at https://spritesapp.com<p>Any kind of feedback is very welcome!<p>Pavel.",1404901824

If not because it is the &quot;right&quot; thing to do and also essential to the long term vision and success of the company.<p>Let me be expository on this for a moment, please.<p>Right now there are three competing visions for the future of the internet:<p>1. The GNU vision: the internet becomes decentralized and every individual has the tools to replicate and manage small, individual infrastructural tasks.<p>2. The Google/Microsoft vision, where a series of non-government economic entities create centralized and competing infrastructure while being supervised by governments in the jurisdictions they operate in.<p>3. The Centrist vision where the internet is essentially a public utility and operated by a quasi-governmental agency or a series of joint governmental agencies.<p>Currently our Internet is somewhere between 2 and 3, with a lot of talented individuals trying to write software and doing research to make #1 more feasible.<p>But #1 is inherently never going to work. Moore&#x27;s law should tip us off, if not the current state of affairs in the world. As software and computing get better, its rate of improvement (or just change, take your pick) increases. This means that it&#x27;s progressively harder to stay abreast of security, devops, and software products. With the best of intentions but a quintessentially first-world outlook, #1 simply creates a series of digital under-classes and rewards the people with the huge time investment and economic support structure implied by people who are currently good at computers.<p>#3 could work, but it assumes that Governments ultimately start to shape up and actually reflect the collective will of their population (as contradictory as that can be). It&#x27;s possible, but I&#x27;m a sceptical.<p>#2 is the closest to working, providing a tension between government and corporation that resembles the tensions present in the American constitution. What&#x27;s more, economic and technical concerns reward this approach. It&#x27;s cheaper to centralize computer infrastructure and when done correctly it&#x27;s a huge cost and materials savings. Competition between said environments also works to keep Corporations focused on the people abandoned by approach #1, keeping their products approachable and with low overhead for starting up.<p>But if Google is seen to constantly violate their user trust and not act as a sufficiently strong user advocate, eventually the populace will demand scenario #3 be enacted (or something with so much governmental input that it is indistinguishable from #3) and we&#x27;ll be in a terrible situation.<p>The biggest benefit to the current system is that Google, Microsoft, and even Baidu all have so much to lose. They need to be receptive to government arguments while all competing with each other.<p>So yes. Google needs to be a white knight in shining armour because they benefit from user trust in a big way.

What I wrote (&quot;The novelty is increased utilization through sharing of what used to be exclusive.&quot;) is actually not the core innovation but its consequence for society.<p>The core innovation of sharing economy is scaling up trust networks people traditionally relied on to mitigate risk involved in sharing transactions. Since the risk of this type of business is high, it used to be done only on a longer term basis, among friends and family and by people who really needed the money and so just had to put up with the risk. This meant that in the old economy sharing transactions were few and far between. Scaling up the trust networks means that they can now become commonplace.",1404900484

Due to the absence of explicit typing the students don&#x27;t bother to understand types anymore and it leads them to a lot of mistakes and misunderstandings: confusion between simple types, lists, dictionaries, instances of a user created class, etc. Besides I think the verbose and rigid syntax of Java forced them to understand what their wrote and for a first language that was a good thing.<p>Overall I found that since it is easier to write code in python they rush to writing anything without understanding the algorithmic problem first. Thus they are less able to decompose a problem in sub-problems and write atomic functions to solve each of them.<p>Note that I think teaching python as a first language is a viable option but in our case the course needs to be intensively rewritten and the labs adapted. For instance my lattest point about algorithms is not a problem with the language: it could be resolved by having a part of the lab being pure algorithmics and then an implementation part.",1404900316

The simple Euler integrator used here has no hope of getting it right (not a criticism, just an observation!)<p>The problem is that the double pendulum equations (in fact, any equations of motion derived from a Hamiltonian) have symplectic structure, i.e. they have conserved quantities. One of the conserved quantities is the total energy of the system.<p>When you discretize the equations to simulate them on a computer, you lose this conservation property (due to discretization error - nothing to do with floating point). The structure of the equations means that the total energy becomes an increasing quantity in time, so you tend to see the simulated system &quot;speed up&quot; or become more energetic as the simulation progresses. The error builds up in the same direction over time - exactly what you don&#x27;t want!<p>The simplest example is the harmonic oscillator, with second-order equation of motion<p><pre><code>  x&#x27;&#x27; = -x\n</code></pre>\nwhich gives the first order equations in terms of position x and momentum p<p><pre><code>  x&#x27; =  p\n  p&#x27; = -x\n</code></pre>\nwhich conserve the total energy 0.5 * (x^2 + p^2). Discretizing these using a first-order forwards Euler scheme<p><pre><code>  x(t+1) = x(t) + p(t) * dt\n  p(t+1) = p(t) - x(t) * dt\n</code></pre>\nyou can see that the total energy changes on each time step to<p><pre><code>  x(t+1)^2 + p(t+1)^2 = x(t)^2 + 2 x(t) p(t) dt + x(t)^2 dt^2 + p(t)^2 - 2 x(t) p(t) dt + p(t)^2 dt^2\n                      = (1 + dt^2) (x(t)^2 + p(t)^2)\n</code></pre>\nso the total energy increases by a factor of (1 + dt^2) each step. Over time, the total energy increases exponentially.<p>The solution is to use a <i>geometric</i> or <i>sympletic</i> integrator which explicitly takes into account the symplectic structure, producing a set of discrete update equations which still conserve a total energy quantity.<p>[0] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symplectic_integrator"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symplectic_integrator</a>",1404900052

Following a book while being taught at a University over a semester is vastly different from what the OP is talking about.  For example, he is talking about writing his own PCIe, SATA and USB drivers as well as, well, everything.  He is not talking about starting with MINIX and a well-digested book that guides you through the process.<p>In fact, your suggestion is exactly on point:  The OP should pick-up Tannenbaum's book and take a year to implement everything in the book.  Why a year?  He is a web developer and, I presume, working.  It will take more than time to learn what he does not know in order to even do the work.  So, let's say a year.<p>I would suspect that after doing that his view of what he proposed might just be radically different.<p>For example, wait until he figures out that he has to write drivers for chip-to-chip interfaces such as SPI and I2C.  Or that implementing a full USB stack will also require supporting the very legacy interfaces he wants to avoid.  Or that writing low-level code to configure and boot devices such as DRAM memory controllers and graphics chips might just be a little tougher than he thought.<p>There's a reason why Linux has had tens of thousands of contributors and millions of lines of code:<p><a href=""http://royal.pingdom.com/2012/04/16/linux-kernel-development-numbers/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://royal.pingdom.com/2012/04/16/linux-kernel-development...</a><p>...and that's just the kernel.",1353977809

It's pure risk premium: he (or she, of course) could've lost it all if things went south. The workers, from the start, had a guaranteed income in exchange for their irreplaceable moments of life on this planet. If the workers want a share of the profits, they are free to raise their own capital and buy shares in the company (or start their own!) just like the capitalist did.<p>Above all the mechanics of capitalism, however, people are also free to pursue their own self-actualization. For some people that involves helping their community, and for some capitalists that community happens to be the workers who helped create their thriving business. At a certain age, having extra capital to be buried with doesn't make one feel as good as philanthropy does.",1353977466

There was a blog post somewhere about exactly that example recently but I can't remember where I saw it.<p>I wrote a GA in Objective-C because, well, I got lazy.  Then, after seeing the dismal performance I got I re-coded it in C.  It's been a couple of years but I think that the performance was hundreds of times faster than anything the optimized Objective-C code could achieve.

As somebody who is a polyglot, but spends a large amount of time writing Objective-C, I have come to absolutely love header files.<p>I see header files almost as documentation. To me, a header file is a description of everything that's public about an API. My header files tend to be very well commented, and very sparse, only containing public methods and typedefs.<p>When the need arises to make internally-includable headers (say I'm writing a static library, and have methods that are private to the library, but public to other classes within the library), I will usually write a `MyApi+Internal.h` header for internal use, which doesn't ship with the library.<p>A developer should never have to dig into implementation files, or into documentation, in order to use a library. Its headers ought to be sufficient.

Yes, I can try to hide the implementation but again, the reason I'm using C++ is because I want the optimal code. Not a double indirected pimpl. If I wanted the indirection I'd be using another language.<p>I love C/C++ and it's quirks. I use it's quirks to make my life easier in ways other some other languages don't. Modules seems like is ignoring some of what makes C/C++ unique and trying to turn it into Java/C#<p>People saying the preprocessor has issues are ignoring the benefits. I miss the preprocessor in languages that don't have one because I miss those benefits.<p>You could say, ""well, just don't use this feature then"" but I can easily see once a project goes down this path, all those benefits of the preprocessor will be lost. You can't easily switch your code between module and include, especially if it's a large project like WebKit, Chrome, Linux, etc.<p>Leave my C++ alone! Get off my lawn!",1353976990

I've been debating between native and HTML5 for the past few days, and reading this article makes me lean ever more toward native.<p>I see that the author's goal is possible.  However, he's also illustrated that getting an HTML5 app to feel native on iOS requires a deep understanding of the underlying implementation of Safari/WebKit.  I assume the benefit to this kind of app design is to keep people familiar with web design from having to learn native development?<p>The problem is that in the quest to not break your comfort zone, you're ultimately forcing yourself to (painfully) learn the depths of the how Safari/WebKit render HTML5 and where its performance 'gotchas' lie.  It seems that the uninitiated would have more unimpeded success using the straightforward, well-documented path of native UI development.<p>Or maybe my assumption is off.  HTML5 was originally appealing to me for the sake of portability; I didn't want to write the same app for umpteen different devices.  While the idea of writing just one nice responsive interface is appealing - doing this in HTML5 in such a way that it provides a good UX across all devices (or at least the ones I care about) means that I need to learn all the pitfalls of how <i>all</i> the rendering engines out there work.  And then there's the maintenance whac-a-mole game that comes when a fix on one platform creates a bug on another...  It seems like for portability it'd be a safer bet to rely on separate code-bases for each platform.  If I'm doing that - what benefit is HTML5 providing me specifically toward portability, and is this benefit outweighed by the fact that I need to be a WebKit/Chrome performance guru?<p>Either way, I'll pose the question again:  Am I missing something (not sarcastic/rhetorical)?",1353976594

Sure, it could always be worse, but it's probably soul crushing enough. That her kids might not hold it against her doesn't mean a thing because kids always love their parents.

Tough love, but sounds like a great idea.<p>I'm curious what it might do to valuations. Now the startups have 12 months of runway instead of 18-24 months depending on the number of founders. This means that at demo day, investors know they could potentially squeeze startups a bit more because the runway is shorter.

It is:<p>For every set A and function f : A -> P(A) there exists y in P(A) such that for all x, f(x) /= y.<p>Proof: Define y = {a: a is not in f(a)}. If f(x) = y, then f(x) = {a: a is not in f(a)}, but this implies x is in f(x) <=> x is not in f(x), contradiction.<p>It does not mention infinity anywhere! It only says that there cannot be a surjection between one set and the other. We could call this situation ""transfinite"" but this is only a name; under the hood, this is a normal proof of properties of functions, using very natural reasoning rules. That's why I disagreed - there's nothing special in Cantor's proof from a formal viewpoint, possible concerns are of psychological/historical nature, which are not relevant to a machine.<p>It is true that changing foundations might require rewriting the prover. However, humans also need time to adjust to a new formal system. For example, it takes a lot of effort to get a good grasp of intuitionistic logic. This might be a concern, but ZFC is a very well-grounded common framework for mathematicians, and this is <i>extremely</i> unlikely to change. Perhaps calculus of constructions, as a version of lambda calculus, is closer to computation, and this is why it was chosen in Coq. I'm not sure. Mizar (another theorem-proving environment) is based on an extension of ZFC. [ZFC is untyped - everything is a set, while CoC has a rich type system.]<p>Small nitpick: It's not like proofs involving unique choice + excluded middle cannot be expressed in Coq; they can, but as the system is inconsistent, they have no value, as everything is provable.",1353975173

However ...<p>1 - No, you don't get to redefine terms how you want. You're entitled to your own opinion, but not to your own definitions or your own facts.<p>Loss leader is mostly well defined (and no, it's not ""7% profit"" or whatever it is you asked). Similarly, subsidy is well defined - it is a lower price than cost. And there's a huge difference between an ETF and a loan. There is a very simple test:<p>Get a two year plan at verizon (or at&t). Use phone. Note cost.<p>Get same phone and equivalent plan without commitment (paying for phone up-front, and month-to-month). Use phone exactly the same. Note cost. The first one is always cheaper with at&t and verizon (though not with t-mobile)<p>Do same in Europe, with e.g. vodaphone, three, etc. And note that - up to financing, costs are the same (and you can get comparable financing from a bank).<p>2 - I actually haven't used any android skin, because everyone I know uses either plain Android or CM (don't have android myself). But from looking it up in e.g. <a href=""http://us.gizmodo.com/5921220/every-major-android-skin-compared"" rel=""nofollow"">http://us.gizmodo.com/5921220/every-major-android-skin-compa...</a> , it seems that actually my experience (which was a Win95/Win98 client, with tens of thousands of installs, and pervasive skinning, back in 99-2001) is extremely relevant.<p>Please enlighten me, because from what I can tell, an android skin is comparable to an enlightenment/gtk/thunderbird skin, plus 4-5 app customizations (people, calendar, notification, maybe a few more). That can totally be done in under $1M. Actually, under $200K if managed properly.<p>And I'm totally unimpressed by the multimillion cost at enterprises; I know it's there, and I know I've replaced such multimillion dollar projects with hundreds-of-thousands dollar projects that performed better (and were still very lucrative). I've also bought better hardware at 10% of the price than some enterprises I've worked with. They do NOT optimize for cost; they optimize for CYA.<p>I've also helped a friend run a VLSI design project that got working tape-outs of a designed-from-scratch processor, all costs included, for $200K in 2005. Everyone you'll ask will tell you that it's impossible. And they'd all be right in their respective frame of mind -- but would be wrong in the real world (<a href=""http://www.reghardware.com/2012/05/03/unsung_heroes_of_tech_arm_creators_sophie_wilson_and_steve_furber/print.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reghardware.com/2012/05/03/unsung_heroes_of_tech_...</a> is enlightening, although our project was not as commercially successful)<p>You might have spent too much time in the enterprise business to realize just how inefficient it is on that front. I probably have more real life experience running and budgeting software (and other) projects than you do: I've done many scales and many environments, software and hardware, not just ""corporate and double digit (mil)"".",1353974777

If you're using Linux with Logical Volume Manager (LVM), you can create a new EBS volume and and attach it as an additional disk device, then stop the file-related processes, unmount the filesystem, add a new Physical Volume  (PV) to your Volume Group (VG), extend the Logical Volume (LV), and resize the filesystem (e.g. e2resize), then re-mount the filesystem.<p>2. Without LVM, attach a new, larger EBS volume, create a filesystem on it, mount it somewhere (/mnt), cp your data to it, unmount it, rm your old files from the / volume, then use the old, empty directory as the mountpoint for your new filesystem.<p>3. If you already had a separate data volume, and you don't want to split it across multiple EBS volumes, you could unmount it, snapshot it, re-constitute it as a new, larger EBS volume, resize the filesystem, and mount it in place of the old one.<p>Making an AMI and a whole new instance is totally unnecessary since resizing the system volume is an indication that you need a separate data volume.",1353974438

You would have to take 65 photos, every day, for a year straight to reach those numbers. That's 1 photo every 15 minutes of your waking life for a year (assuming 8 hours sleep).<p>That's considerably a bit more than a 'hobby'.<p>At your levels, I consider $200/year rather reasonable for that level of obsession. The amount a traditional film camera user would have had to spend in developing and film costs alone for that level of usage would be astronomical.<p>The only quasi-reasonable complaint there is the long term storage costs of your high level of need. However, you're also making a special case of needing those photos 'everywhere'. Comparing to traditional photography there would have been no way to lug around 24,000 photos. They would have been stored, with the negatives, in an album somewhere. Kind of like sitting on a harddrive - which the going rate for 120GB is $25 (250 GB external for $50) as a one-time purchase cost.<p>I understand your desire to have everything digital available at all times and backed up against disasters, but there is going to be a cost associated with that.<p>And that cost is MASSIVELY cheaper, even at today's rates, than someone with your 'hobby' would have been spending trying to do the same thing, 10-15 years ago.",1368024737

So if your time is worth $75/hour now (you douched it up a couple days ago with that ""narcissistic shit"" comment, so I'm pricing you conservatively) then your 5-year $75-struck option is worth at least $75 (higher, actually, due to volatility) and you'd get to collect that now.<p>You take the option premium, invest it in yourself now, and if you're called in, you get additional pay (the strike price of the option) for the work.<p><i>I also find ""set by the market, with the seller's right to set a floor"" extremely dubious. What market dictates this?</i><p>Well, that's the hard part. The reason we find ""X-percent-of-future-income"" deals to be tasteless and gimmicky is that there's still a stigma against publicly looking for work. It either means, to a lot of people, that you're either desperate, or sociopathic and looking for the highest bidder. That's why work and consulting especially often comes down to these medieval-era reputation economies.<p>Building the market would be a non-trivial undertaking, but it would improve the freelancer's life (income stability) substantially.<p><i>Further, how responsive does the freelancer have to be to their client? Do they have to drop everything at a moment's notice or risk liability for the investment?</i><p>I would say that the contract should specify a minimum and maximum hours per week, and that the initial price is repaid if the person can't meet that commitment.<p>This means that 5-year-window options might not be practical, because you're right that there's the priority problem. What if someone sells 2500 hours of time with a 5-year window and it's all called in in the last 4 months?

You write your application model in a DSL - which is meant to be easy to read.
Our DSL Platform takes your model, migrates your database and gives you back a compiled library to use (PHP for web, Java for Android, etc...)

5674236,comment,5673339,5673636,4,0,wpietri,,,"There are two things you could mean here.<p>One is that you are, like a lot of people, modestly averse to doing something novel that seems hard. (E.g., ""I could never run a 5k."" Actually you could; you just don't know how to get there from where you are.) That's a solvable problem. The main trick is to get started; oonlynce you are doing research on customers, the hacker part of your brain will have data and something to start optimizing, so you'll be fine.<p>If that's you, try something like Lean Startup Machine. I volunteer as a mentor for it, and the team context and short timelines force you to get out there and start bothering random strangers. Who it turns out are not bothered at all, and are happy to talk. Once you get good at it, it's even fun. From there, read a few of the Lean Startup books; they're full of techniques.<p>The other thing you could mean is that you are literally terrified of dealing with potential customers. That is also not unusual. Programmers skew shy. The main reason I spent most of my teenage years learning to code was that I was awkward and people were scary.<p>If that bothers you, go see somebody about it. Call up a few therapists and have a meeting with the ones you like. If you find somebody solid, dig into the social anxiety. I know it goes against the hacker ethos to spend 20 hours dealing with a professional when you could spend 200 or 2000 hours trying to solve the problem yourself. But in this case, I think it's worth trying to get quickly to the think you really want to do, which is make and sell some things that people are excited to buy.",1368022806

5674153,comment,5673544,5673544,1,0,orclev,,,"I tried this on a recent couple projects and it failed miserably on both of them for completely different reasons. On one, the architecture of the project dictated really really fast network connections and the overhead from the VM choked the project. That's probably an unfair example because this was actually a toy project that was never meant to run in a serious environment (hence the requirement of a huge bandwidth virtually 0 latency network connection). The other failure however is more serious. Our company (and at least one project) dictates a Windows based development environment, and the abysmal performance of NTFS combined with a massive project code base meant it was taking 2+ minutes just to run a status check on the version controlled code.<p>I think given a Linux host environment this might work better, or a smaller code base, but at least in these two situations it was a failure.",1368021909

Perhaps dropbox is the solution, but I've probably got something like 120GB of photos... and only 132GB of space there. Now what... I have to pay still more to dropbox to get their 200GB plan.<p>I'll be buying a NAS in a couple weeks. This should be awesome, but wait, I want the wide integration that dropbox provides. Is the solution to save everything to dropbox and move it out on a regular basis onto the NAS?<p>In short, I don't feel I should need to spend $200/year (plus $25 more for flickr), so that I can organize and maintain a photo hobby.

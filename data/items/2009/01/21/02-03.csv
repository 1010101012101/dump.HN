It's not so dissimilar from other websites or the web itself. Sure, it would probably make for a cool looking graph, but it has no bearing on the underlying storage method in this particular case. If it was necessary to understand or perform some kind of analysis on the relationships between objects like social networks and search engines do, they would probably have a more interesting storage mechanism to look at.<p>Personally, what I find surprising about this whole thing is that people are so amazed at the simplicity of the schema. A wiki is a fairly simple application. Think about it. If you were going to build one it's not much more than a basic CRUD application. You really only have articles (with versioning), user accounts, images/media and whatever other oddball features you want to have like statistics and IP restrictions. Hell, I remember seeing some beginning Ruby on Rails book that used a wiki as the tutorial application. This is pretty basic stuff.",1232506586

442670,comment,442352,442352,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"Sounds like the girl wasn't prepared for the course, I'm sure it could have been dealt with. My wifes college course <i>demanded</i> that <i>every</i> student have a working version of windows XP SP2 or SP3 (vista not allowed), Office 2003 (ironically <i>all</i> her computing books are 2007) and they were trying to get students to pay $2000 for a laptop through them, which the equivalent was about $500 in walmart although no one was forced to buy through them (however they are with their books).<p>I offered my laptop for my wife to borrow as it's XP SP2, Office 2007 and kicks the requirements ass three-fold. However, she never had to use it because they all get free access to the computer labs, which quite ironically all run Vista even though the requirements were for XP. She could essentially do every bit of work for the class at school, yet they're telling all the students they need a laptop.<p>If she does need a laptop in her second year then we'll probably get her an Acer Aspire One as they're like $350 from Costco and meet the colleges minimum specs. Plus I wouldn't have a problem using it if she ever needed a more powerful laptop.<p>I personally dislike Ubuntu, but I think the bigger deal here is that colleges set ridiculous requirements. I mean I don't use Ubuntu, I don't even want to touch the sucker, but even <i>I</i> know that if I was stuck I just need to download OpenOffice! I think a college, who have computer departments (and my wifes has free advice on fixing any computer problem from their computer department, or tax-free repairs) could figure this one out. Even Google Docs saves in Word documents!<p>On the case of the internet, that's Verizon's fault for not keeping up to date, but even then I installed my first internet connection at like 7 years old. I'm pretty sure I'd be able to dumbly stumble my way into setting up the internet on Ubuntu and I could have it done within a couple of minutes with a guide on how to do it or even the knowledge of where things are in Ubuntu.<p>Summary: Absolutely everyone in this case was retarded. The girl shouldn't have quit, should have returned the laptop or just dealt with it through OpenOffice and calling verizon to ask how to install it manually. Verizon should create a setup disk for Linux. Dell should be shipping its Ubuntu versions with OpenOffice. Linux users shouldn't freak out and give the media a free article.",1232505267

Launch costs alone are in the neighborhood of $10,000/kg for large American providers and somewhat less in other providers/countries.  I believe no one has come close to the $1,000/kg mark yet.<p>Because launch is so expensive, people then spend a lot more money making sure the payloads are ultra-reliable (launching a replacement is just too expensive).  Because costs are so high, there isn't enough business to really get good economies of scale (yet...go SpaceX!) - so a lot of money goes into design and testing of new rockets that will only see 10-100 units built.<p>As for launch itself, fuel is pretty cheap - turbopumps are expensive.

How do they know that the money that I don't spend on {insert something} because I hear it and discover that I don't like it isn't money that I do spend on some other music?  (I'm not saying that they can't know the answer.  I'm asking whether they do know the answer.)<p>Preventing bad buys certainly leads to greater satisfaction with the music purchased.  The happier that I am with a product, the more that I buy.  Then again, I'm not Dutch.",1232503432

For one it would be bio-degradable, and you wouldn't worry as much keeping this stuff around children because this is natural material.<p>Sure there are extremely poor people who might not be able to afford the extra money, but anybody concerned with the environment and their health would have sufficient reason to use this material. Another argument is that since plastic is so cheap, even if this liquid wood is many times the price of plastic it can still be affordable.",1232503389

If you don't mind a slower, more concept-based learning method, you can supplement your programming projects with this book.",1204249216

I wiped Vista to put XP on it, but I couldn't find drivers for XP for things like the wireless card. Turns out some of the newer hardware doesn't even come with XP drivers.<p>I would have but Ubuntu on there but unfortunately my parents need some Windows only software for various reasons.",1204248821

125810,comment,125766,125766,0,0,arvid,,,"I would suggest The Little Schemer to understand the concepts of Lisp/Scheme. I would read and digest this before any other lisp book. The book appears to be an easy read but it is not.  Practical Common Lisp lives up to its name and has some very good  examples/projects intermixed with lessons.  Be prepared to spend a lot of time manipulating, breaking down and refactoring code (for macros use  macroexpand-1). This is exactly what you need to do when you get that lost feeling.  The best thing about lisp/scheme is that the interpreter is always available to you to test and environments like slime or allegro IDE which allow interaction between the editor and interpreter.  Also checkout lispcast (<a href=""http://www.lispcast.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lispcast.com/</a>)",1204248577

[<a href=""http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/</a>] Its a great book to learn Lisp from IMO. The pace is just right (for me) and every chapter tackles a truly practical project. Its free online, so you don't have much to lose just to try it.<p>I have also heard really good things about PG's ""On Lisp"" [<a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/onlisp.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/onlisp.html</a>]. Again, its free to download, so you don't have much to lose to try it.<p>Hope this helps.",1204246828

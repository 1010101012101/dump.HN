Currently this is done with implicit reads/writes, but what I&#x27;m saying is that the hardware can then optimise these instructions however it likes.<p>The underlying principle is that breaking down complex operations into a series of simpler ones is easy, combining a series of simpler operations into a complex one, once hardware can handle doing the complex one faster, is much harder. x86 lagged behind in performance at the beginning because of a sequential microsequencer, but once Intel figured out how to parallelise that with the P6, they leapt ahead.<p>Linus being an Intel fanboy has nothing to do with whether x86 has an advantage or not. But even if you look at cross-CPU benchmarks like SPEC, x86 is consistently at the top of per-thread per-GHz performance, beating out the SPARCs and POWERs, and those are <i>high performance</i>, very expensive RISCs. I&#x27;d really like to see whether AMD&#x27;s ARMs can do better than that.",1391003807

What was once a frontier pushing expedition has turned into a sport for rich idiots who are practically being dragged up and down the mountain by their sherpas and expedition leaders. There may be an occasional experienced climber but mostly the mountain is filled with rich tourists who have hardly any climbing skills.<p>This is well portrayed in the Discovery documentary Everest, which shows a group of people attempting to get to the summit. The mountain is so full of people that are queues of people waiting in line while inexperienced climbers ahead move slowly through the bottle necks (narrow ledges and ladders, etc).<p>The documentary also portrays the death of climber David Sharp [1] who was left to die up in the mountain. In the documentary, it is shown that he was found during descent in a very bad condition. There is some controversy if this is true and whether he was actually found on the ascent instead. If he was found during the descent, leaving him might be considered acceptable since the party who found him would have been exhausted, low on oxygen and the daylight fading fast.<p>But if the situation is (as some have suggested, and the Wikipedia article says) that he was actually found on ascent and left to die while going for the summit instead, it is very morally questionable  thing to do. Going to the summit, which is essentially only a tourist attraction at this point, instead of attempting to save a man&#x27;s life is something that I might never comprehend. Even if the chances of saving that man were slim, not attempting the rescue is questionable.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Sharp_(mountaineer)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Sharp_(mountaineer)</a>",1391003144

Most people think &quot;selfish, expensive and dangerous&quot; is a fantastic lifestyle, as long as the risks are long term.<p>The short term risk of dying on Everest is really low, like 5% or so (depending how you fudge the numbers, for example the death rate of people who summit is way higher than people who nope on the way to 3rd camp and come home, but on average someone who takes a leave of absence from work to &quot;climb Everest&quot; has about 95% chance of returning).  Note that your very long term risk of death is approximately 100% so 5% isn&#x27;t all that impressive.<p>The short term death rate from &quot;selfish, expensive and dangerous&quot; like smoking, drinking alcohol, eating fast food, watching TV is about zero plus or minus drunk driving.  The long term death rate is far higher than climbing Everest.<p>So they just have a set of tradeoffs different than your own.  More people have been killed watching TV shows about Everest because they sit on the couch and get fat and have a heart attack, than people killed actually climbing Everest.<p>The only thing sadder than people who died climbing Everest is people who died because they like bacon cheeseburgers too much, or they drink too much beer, or they got fat sitting on the couch watching Oprah reruns.",1391002951

Bottled oxygen doesn&#x27;t make you function as well as at sea level, it just prolongs the period a climber can spend in the death zone.<p>But climbing at that altitude is difficult and hard work all the time and there are some narrow ledges and vertical climbs where climbers will essentially have in a queue one at a time.<p>And there&#x27;s only a few weeks per year when you can actually access the mountain summit. Most of the year the winds in the jet streams will blow at hundreds of miles an hour making the summit inaccessible. During the few weeks preceding the monsoon season, the jet streams will slow down and during that time there are so many climbers going up and down that it is literally crowded to the point that it is hard to move.<p>There have been a few successful rescue attempts of stricken but still alive climbers near the summit but the rescuers essentially risk their own lives to save their buddies.<p>An attempt to recover dead bodies at a risk to your own life is not deemed worth it, even if you disregard all the money and effort it takes.",1391001752

Unless you are reverse engineering malware, whatever you are analyzing is unlikely to have been written in assembly or to be heavily obfuscated. Then it&#x27;s more about knowing how certain high-level programming constructs (think virtual function calls in C++) will be translated into assembly by a compiler, what residual information there might be left in the binary or what all that noise is you are seeing (think C++ templates, destructors called for stack-allocated variables..).<p>For many reverse engineering projects, assembly might be a wholly uselss skill, since whatever you are looking at is actually MSIL or running on Python with its own embedded interpreter.

Even if a more permissive BSD or MIT license were used, you could still be prevented from distributing due to patent rulings.<p>That is true. But in that case it is not the license that prevents me from distributing and I can negotiate with the patent holders, pay royalties and have the problem resolved.<p>The anti-patent clause in the GPLv2 prevents that: even if <i>I</i> get all the patent licensing in place, I cannot distribute the software if I cannot pass the same rights onto others. That is the whole point of it: as I understand it, it is a tool to fight the freedom battle.<p>> In any case, many popular open-source encoders are also under either GPLv2 or LGPLv2.1. Examples include libx264, libmp3lame, libfdk_aac, libfaac. The license hasn&#x27;t prevented them being very useful to many people<p>That is also true. I&#x27;m just providing a different point of view, one which you might not have heard about: many commercial products cannot include those libraries because of the legal risk.<p>I will not respond to people that shout &quot;FUD&quot; without any arguments. What I wrote was not a rant, and was based on my experience in several companies, each of which got legal advice about this. So, if you believe I&#x27;m wrong, please imagine for a moment that I&#x27;m building tablets (hence, &quot;distributing&quot; software), I have licensed all the relevant patents (thus, I pay royalties) and describe how you think Section 7 of the GPLv2 permits me to distribute software that requires payment of royalties.<p>EDIT: after reading all the (unnecessarily heated) responses, I think I will have to draw some diagrams. People seem to misunderstand the problem. Again: with many other licenses I can license the patents, and the patent license will cover all my (and my users&#x27;) usage. With GPLv2 this is not possible, because Section 7 requires that no restrictions be placed on <i>anyone</i>.<p>In other words: yes, it is true that patents are problem for all licenses. No, it is not true that GPLv2 is equivalent to BSD/MIT/other licenses in this regard.",1391001454

It seems to me as an interesting &quot;reach your goal, without setting hard (sub)goals in between&quot;(?)<p>If I understand correctly, you set out to code one site per day, without specifying beforehand what you would do each day? Every day you said, &quot;ok, today I&#x27;ll do this&quot;? Was it difficult to choose between possibilities, and how did you address that? Where there end conditions for the day&#x27;s goal? Or you just went as far as you could? How did you manage to stay focused on the day&#x27;s project, without branching off to various tangents? Were some days under- or overwhelming, in their difficulty?<p>..Sorry for the wall of text, but any experience/advice/insight, would be greatly appreciated. ..Congratulations, once more.",1391000856

Misleading advices like yours do nothing to help people understand the legal climate of copyright and patents, and thus only spread fear, uncertainty and doubt.<p>The license choice of this program do absolutely nothing to the fact that infringing patent rights run the risk of forcing a company to stop distributing a product. BSD, GPL, MIT, Apache, proprietary license, public domain. It. Does. Not. Matter. Copyright law and patent law are two different area of law.<p>That someone might come and impose condition on the distributor for &quot;other reasons&quot;, is quite irrelevant. Of course someone might go to Microsoft and use a rubber hose to impose condition on then, but what the ... does that has to do with copyright licenses? Someone can equally easy impose restriction that prevent a company to comply with the BSD license.<p>Patent agreements are also not even covered by the GPLv2. This has been said by the lawyers who made the license. If you do not trust that, then trust all the lawyers who argued with Stallman to not include such provisions in the GPLv3 draft, which include many of the largest software companies in the world. So again, I call FUD on such claims. If your claim was true, GPLv3 would not be said to had adding it.<p>Last, companies such as blizzard included LGPLv2 software in their flagship product called Starcraft 2. If companies would go for such great lengths to avoid using GPL licenses (the LGPLv2 code itself is under same requirement as GPLv2 except for the linking exception), then how come they couldn&#x27;t spend the few extra weeks to replace a small library? Or should we all expect that blizzards lawyers are incompetent and this flagship product was just extremely lucky to not been sent to the grave? again, I call FUD.<p>So Please, stop with the FUD. Why ruin more comment threads about interesting software with it? Some people come here to discuss technology.",1391000527

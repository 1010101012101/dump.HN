I will be here another three months at the least before returning to the US.<p>The hiring practices around here for developers is standard for most jobs in the US (from what I&#x27;m told). Students from top schools get recruited right from the university if they have good grades.<p>However, as you may guess, grades aren&#x27;t always an indicator of quality. Of the seven developers that had been hired since the time I was hired, only around three have any code quality. I&#x27;ve seen front-end developers struggle writing simple Javascript. A backend developer with supposedly three years of experience as a lead can barely write coherent Java, always scouring stackoverflow to find snippets. That same developer also had tried to steal code from me and claim it as his own. It was a git-deployment tool, and given that he never learned to use Git, I was immediately suspicious. Looking through the repository he had created, most of it was copy-and-pasted code with the author attribution overwritten with his name. Thank god for the logs at that moment!<p>To clarify, I have also seen some excellent developers here. They work extremely fast, and so their work-ethic is enviable; exceed expectations and then work at east on the next features given. They rapidly implement changes in UI and features at a pace I no doubt could not do.<p>Overall, I agree with this article&#x27;s point. Maybe myself and the author are wrong, and I just have a bias based on my experience.",1386593469

The electronic states are changed and spread out by being bonded to other atoms and you get bulk collective properties like polarizability. The relativistic contraction mentioned in the article is still relevant for the electrons&#x27; energy levels in bulk gold (a big lump much larger than the wavelength of visible light) and so neglecting it would give the wrong colour for bulk gold.<p>Structures up to a few hundred nanometers in size could also conceivably affect the colour. This is kind of like how the atomic-level description of a radio antenna doesn&#x27;t really matter, more its bulk properties like conductivity. The gold nanoparticle effect is due to Mie scattering (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mie_Scattering\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mie_Scattering</a>), which is the scattering of light off dielectric spheres approximately the size of the wavelength of light.

If you know how to use it, it&#x27;s safer than a dull knife; if you don&#x27;t, then you need to have your totin&#x27; chip taken away.<p>I like to compare it to the F4U Corsair: anyone but a talented and experienced pilot at the yoke will lead to certain disaster. But the thing is just <i>so</i> powerful and <i>so</i> absurdly versatile that until something decisively and significantly better comes along it remains a mainstay of any halfway decent air force.<p>A lot of people confuse being the Corsair of programming languages with being the Corvair of programming languages -- &quot;unsafe at any speed&quot;. They&#x27;re full of it. Their ignorance and lack of experience prevents them from seeing the scenarios in which the utility of C++ is absolutely indispensable.",1386590641

Interesting to see that in the past (on an HTC Desire) the only place it seems to have picked up on this was when connecting to my WiFi at home and even then, very rarely.<p>The day I bought a Nexus 4, the location history exploded.

I used that to build an Expert System that dynamically changed the security policy of an SeLinux system depending on the state of the system and its network for my Master's Thesis. You can do some pretty amazing things with Expert Systems if you design them well.

89578,comment,89525,89525,0,0,Goladus,,,"I wouldn't worry about switching off until you find yourself mentally wrestling with problems that cannot be solved like that.  Relationship problems are a good example.  Usually, no amount of continuous 24/7 thinking is going to bring you to a good answer.  <p>Also if you are tired and can't stop thinking about something, but can't actually solve it without rest, you might want to investigate techniques for clearing your head.<p>Finally, if you're concerned about negative side-effects of work obsession, like not being able to 'see the forest through the trees' then you might want to as well.",1197649881

Here are my tools:<p>- I have a wiki for fast brain dumps<p>- I play sport at least once a week with a friend who is an accountant, he brings me back down to earth!<p>- I have children, they are great because there is no compromise and the world looks different when you've  been with them for a while, granted this is a drastic 'tool'<p>- I ALWAYS make lists of things I need to do tomorrow.<p>- I trust that my ideas are good enough that they (and I) can wait until tomorrow.<p>- I go to gigs, nothing like live music to wipe your mind of troubles. You also get to meet non tech people which is good.<p>Good luck",1197649833

If I am working om something that is not interesting, my brain is usually occupied by 'the-next-interesting-thing-that-I-will-do-at-work'. The only ways to switch myself off is to play games, or when I read something that is more insteresting than whatever I am working on, not necessarily fiction. I think it is a fate for us thinking people.",1197649602

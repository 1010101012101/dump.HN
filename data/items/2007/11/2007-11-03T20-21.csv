Now when a kid learns calculus at age 10, it is impossible to explain it simply by hard work. And unlike the article, I would put Mozart into this category.<p>What is deducible from the research is simply that P( successful | no hard work) = 0, but P( successful | work hard) > 0.",1194123300

SF to LA 6.5 hr of driving, SF to San Diego, over 9 hrs.<p>In the same distance in europe you would have Rome, Milano, Paris, Berlin, Zurich, Vienna, Frankfurt.... and so many other cities in between.

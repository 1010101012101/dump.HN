The only really challenging part of this was what you briefly touched on towards the end:<p>> If I were more clever, I would have updated the script to not include words that fit certain criteria, or I would have done something more absurd like using natural language processing to see if the word pertains to writing. (that sounds possible, right?) Rather, I went through the 501 words manually and picked out the 49 that seemed arguably relevant to writing<p>In other words, you&#x27;ve solved the simple case perfectly well, but your solution is not yet scalable: How would you deal with a 100x100 grid? You&#x27;d probably need to optimise your search code (e.g. abandon looking for stupidly long words, or better yet once there are no possible longer words in the dictionary), and you&#x27;d definitely need to do <i>some</i> sort of dictionary definition search to help decide which answers are correct!<p>This almost looks like the sort of question Google would ask job applicants to answer, but they&#x27;d almost certainly extend the challenge to something like this 100x100 scenario!",1423741722

(e.g. printf(&quot;%s\n&quot;, some_string.c_str() works fine).<p>That said, I tend to avoid std::string as well, due to other performance issues (you tend to have a lot of copies and lots of heap allocations you don&#x27;t really need).

9467612,comment,9458919,9462387,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"As I understand it, one of the difficult problems on Windows is the file locking semantics. When a library is loaded in memory it cannot be replaced on disk. So updates require a reboot to put new files into place. This might be the cause of the effect you describe (administrator being unable to delete files).<p>It has been about ten years since I maintained some Windows installation packages for a reasonably large project (originally built with a proprietary package builder when I took it over from the previous maintainer and then I ported it to build using a fork of the Python MSI builder). So my understanding of Windows package management and the pains of making things work reasonably is weak and out of date. So take this guess with a grain of salt. I might even be describing what happens and why wrong I dunno...I avoid working on Windows as much as possible, so my ignorance is high.<p>I can really only speak to the comparison of OneGet to apt or yum, which is absurd on its face. And, I have observed the interesting level of denial that kicks in whenever criticism is leveled at an OS based on weak package management. There&#x27;s always a lot of &quot;well, I just do this ridiculously unwieldy thing and pretend like it isn&#x27;t a ridiculous and unwieldy thing to do, so I don&#x27;t see why I would want something like apt or yum&quot;. This tread has been no exception. It&#x27;s like I&#x27;m insulting them personally when I say the workflow they are having inflicted on them by their OS is suboptimal.",1430427548

This is because you cannot consider specificity and sensitivity without taking into account the prevalence. Let us look at the data from the paper [1].<p>From the chart on page 3, we can see that the percentage of banned ranges from 1.7% to 3.3%.  On the last page we have the phrase &quot;Though average classifier precision is relatively high (0.80), one in five users identified as antisocial are nonetheless misclassified&quot;. Based on this, I think we have a specificity of 80%, and a sensitivity of 80%.<p>Let us look at 1000 hypothetical users, using 3% as the prevalence. Flagged and Not Flagged represent the output of the algorithm, and Regular and Banned represent &quot;Gold Standard&quot;<p><pre><code>             |Regular  |  Banned |\n\n  --------------------------------\n\n  Total      |970      |  30\n\n  ----------------------------------\n\n  Flagged    |194      |  24\n\n  ----------------------------------\n\n  Not Flagged | 776    |   6\n</code></pre>\nIn this example, the algorithm will flag 218 out of a thousand people as being trolls. 194 of the 218 people flagged are actually not trolls. Doing any sort of automated banning based on this algorithm will I think be unacceptable.<p>I may have some of my stats or assumptions wrong, and I would love to be educated why if that is the case.<p>1. <a href=""http://arxiv.org/pdf/1504.00680v1.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/pdf/1504.00680v1.pdf</a>",1430427510

OS/2 2.0 was hailed as a better DOS than DOS and a better Windows than Windows. That is until Microsoft made Windows NT and 32 bit Windows applications and later Windows 95. OS/2 failed to get developers to support native mode as they could just write DOS and 16 bit Windows programs and they would run on OS/2. Meanwhile Microsoft made development tools for Windows and Borland made them as well that made development for 32 bit Windows in Visual Studio or Borland Delphi a lot easier.<p>Blackberry has added the Amazon app store and the ability to run Android apps on modern Blackberry phones. They had to because few would develop for their platform.<p>I went to see a movie with friends, the Regal cinema, before the movie they had an ad that said to download the Regal movie app for Android and iOS. A friend yelled at the screen &quot;Why not for Windows Phone as well?&quot; It seems most developers target iOS and Android but hardly ever Windows Phone.<p>Microsoft should be sharing information with third parties and open source groups to make better and easier development tools for Windows Phone and the Windows Universal apps. A developer should be able to use free and open source development tools to write apps for Windows Phone and Windows Universal apps instead of having to use Visual Studio. So now Microsoft is changing Visual Studio to convert Android and iOS code to Windows Phone. Microsoft doesn&#x27;t get it yet that not every developer is going to use their Visual Studio and you got a lot of developers using Linux or Mac OSX to write code that want to use the development tools they are already experienced with without having to learn a new tool.<p>Edit: fixed a typo and added more detail on the fall of OS/2.",1430427493

See the section of the paper where they discuss how the two groups converge in outcomes as time passes.<p>(This is complicated by the high attrition in the control group: they lost track of a third to a half of the control group and so couldn&#x27;t do an intent-to-treat analysis; they argue that the bias from this heavy attrition is probably in the direction of understating the benefits since it was mostly the ones who were worst-off at baseline who disappeared, but of course there&#x27;s no way to be sure and one could easily argue the opposite.)",1430426961
9467550,comment,9464941,9467434,0,0,DavidSJ,,,"> It is perfectly possible to miss orbit even after a complete circumnavigation.<p>Yes, if you have a source of lift, and you&#x27;re within the atmosphere, then you can circumnavigate the globe without reaching orbital velocities. A ballistic rocket generally has no significant source of lift and spends nearly all of its time in space.<p>> Trajectories are shaped like parabolas, not ellipses.<p>All orbits are conic sections: either an ellipse, hyperbola, or a parabola (the limiting case between the two).  But a parabolic or hyperbolic trajectory has escape velocity, whereas only an elliptic trajectory is planet-bound. The apogee of the ellipse is locally approximated well by a parabola, which is why for <i>non-orbital</i> mechanics ballistic trajectories are often modeled by a parabola, but all suborbital trajectories are actually ellipses, not parabolas. If the Earth were flat and the gravity vector were constant, then they would be actual parabolas.<p>Orbital mechanics is very counterintuitive. I recommend <i>Fundamentals of Astrodynamics</i> if you&#x27;d like to learn more, or play KSP rather than FSP.<p>> Well it&#x27;s more like a quarter<p>On this you are correct, the map I looked at deceived me. :)",1430426947

I have a highly relevant example from the Runescape Game Client that happened today! Language selection was broken for the Mac version of the client. Users were unable to choose German/French/Portuguese worlds because of this.<p>A short fix was added to remedy this problem. But 99% of the users will never know this problem was fixed because Jagex doesn&#x27;t maintain a public facing change log. Only a short &quot;New:&quot; for the most recent change.<p>Many Mac users who want to use the client but were prevented by being unable to change their language will <i>never know</i> once the next client update happens and the &quot;New: Fixed Mac language selection&quot; is removed. The fix was only mentioned by a Jagex employee on an infrequently browsed forum, where one day even the post will be lost once it goes past Page 50 (nothing is archived).<p>This is a scenario where a maintained Change Log (and public awareness of updates) would be highly beneficial to users.<p>The practice of tests has not caught on for all software - and more complex software often lacks pass/fail test builds for the public (eg: where are the tests for Photoshop?)<p>For apps - not everyone has unlimited data plans. So many people turn off automated updates. Data limits still exist at home for many non-U.S. users, so downloading updates on WiFi also isn&#x27;t an option. Frequent updates (especially frequent, large updates) are annoying and prevent users from using an app due to data limits.<p>Due to said data limits, many people will only update when an update brings something beneficial. A useful feature, vastly improved performance, or important security fixes. Otherwise why waste the data?<p>>yet a tiny extremely-vocal set of people occasionally complain about changelogs if you make the mistake of writing software they install.<p>Change logs help developers too. Especially for open source projects [0] but also for internal projects. I&#x27;d argue it is less useful when the project is maintained entirely by a single person, as they will be aware of all changes they have made. However the moment there are 2 or more people working on the project, a change log becomes a useful asset for squashing bugs and keeping everyone up-to-date on important changes and deprecation changes of larger projects.<p>[0] <a href=""http://keepachangelog.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://keepachangelog.com/</a>",1430426733

Just as quite a few (possibly most?) companies will have their own coding policies as well.<p>The problem is when individuals decide to go off piste and do their own thing. But then those same individuals could equally be likely to bypass gofmt when writing code (which is very easily done), or to ignore company policy about tab spaces et al when writing Python code.<p>That said, I&#x27;ve learned to love gofmt for the laziness it brings. Text editors that auto-close brackets and such like can often be more of an intrusion than an asset. Where as gofmt only jumps in after the document is saved and the syntax is parsed for errors. So sometimes I find myself just throwing code down knowing that gofmt will tidy it up for me as I go. Which I&#x27;d be the first to admit is a pretty bad habit to get into hehehe",1430426164

(I also happen to have a few minutes to kill as I need to wake myself up more while I&#x27;m waiting for someone else to finish something so we can go get lunch.)<p>I use changelogs for libraries and tools, but I certainly don&#x27;t use them to decide whether or not to upgrade something... the things that are most important are often the one line fixes that no one really ran into or characterized well but when someone came across them was like &quot;wow, I can&#x27;t imagine how this ever worked before&quot;. I will decide whether or not to upgrade based on tests: if it doesn&#x27;t work, then I don&#x27;t upgrade; if it works, then I upgrade.<p>For apps, or minor little things, the idea that people care about changelogs is just strange to me: people use websites constantly that just kind of change in minor ways and the world doesn&#x27;t end. The Facebook app on my phone automatically updates, and I know they send a new build of whatever they have to Apple every week whether they have major new stuff or not. Their changelog is forever essentially &quot;we push new stuff every week, hopefully it will make you happy&quot;.<p>And, strangely to me, because it is an app and not a website, some people seem upset at this and want a better changelog. It seriously has made me prefer making websites and server-side components to client-side stuff, as people never ask me to do the extra useless-for-most-normal-users work of maintaining a changelog if I make a website, yet a tiny extremely-vocal set of people occasionally complain about changelogs if you make the mistake of writing software they install.",1430425062

I&#x27;m one of those former iOS users who jumped ship to a cheaper Android phone.<p>But while there&#x27;s only so much room for $10 text editors like Vesper, there are plenty of people who are content to keep dumping money into Candy Crush. As much as I hate it, I don&#x27;t see that revenue stream drying up. Even if nobody ever wrote a new text editor for iOS, Apple would be fine. The 1000 editors that have been written already are enough.<p>MS&#x27;s approach is pretty interesting. It&#x27;s tempting to write it off as an OS/2 style &quot;Why would anybody bother writing apps if it&#x27;s compatible with Android&quot; scenario, but I see that more as a stop-gap to get their phones in people&#x27;s hands. Without it, people are missing work essential apps (Hipchat/Slack/Trello/etc) and apps driven by friend-networks (Snapchat) that can&#x27;t be easily substituted, even if a similar alternative is available. Maybe with this, they&#x27;ll have a bit of luck in actually selling phones.

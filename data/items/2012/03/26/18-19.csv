Meade, Maryland (between Baltimore and DC).  It's a relatively small place that's open daily and seems to be a labor of love by retired NSA codebreakers.<p>The museum has a four-rotor Enigma machine, which is about the size of a typewriter.  It is packed into a wooden case and deployable into the field.<p>The museum also has a ""Bombe"", the Enigma codebreaking machine devised originally by Polish mathematicians, and improved by Alan Turing and others, and fabricated in quantity by the British and the Americans during the war.  This an electromechanical device the size of several refrigerators.<p>So nice to see them both together.  Of course, I have today's simple and compact encryption technology in my phone, and right across the parking lot from the museum, there is an acreage of computers (Ft. Meade) which is probably able to decrypt what I send, if desired.  Same as it ever was.",1332788302

Yes, I agree that third-party redirects don't appeal to many users, but the same goes for a payment form hosted on your site. You have to understand that the credit card is a relatively new form of payment, where in the US almost everybody has one. If we order something online, we usually pay afterr we've received the shipment, or through a system called Ideal (in The Netherlands, that is. Can't vouch for other countries), which is basically some sort of API between the website and your own bank. Paypal isn't used much by European websites, other than the ones targetting the whole world and some shifty websites. fYI: most webshop CMS like Magento come with a built in Ideal shopping cart.<p>The problem is that, while one economic region, Europe is still a collection of separate countries. We all have our own banks, so the chances of one European payment provider coming are slim to say the least.

That's 17 years. Seventeen years in which even very limited carrier competition brought prices way down and speeds way up. Does anyone remember how much a 128kbps ISDN used to run?<p>Seventeen years in which the typical consumer went from downloading mainly text and gifs to downloading mainly (bandwidthwise) lengthy videos, many of them high def. Despite the fact that, as Bray puts it, ""once the network operator has your monthly payment, they’re powerfully incented to keep you from using the network.""<p>Now any reasonable person can imagine how mobile might change things. But Bray gives such ludicrously short shrift to the power of flat-rate pricing it is hard to take anything else he writes in the essay seriously.<p>Of <i>course</i> the idea of unlimited usage is an illusion. Consumers know this. They have always known this in the deep and visceral way that only a flaky modem/ISDN/DSL/cable/EDGE/GPRS/3G connection can convey. But they like the trade offs: The ISP limits your bandwidth basically continuously such that your connection might slow down or outright disappear and such that latency might increase. In return, your bill is predictable.<p>ISPs have always worked this way. Always. You'd dial the modem bank and get a busy signal. Or you'd connect -- perhaps even through newfangled DSL technology, which in theory insulated you from your neighbors -- only to find the provider's upstream internet link was saturated. Or you'd jump on a cable connection and find it running at half speed because your neighbors were awake.<p>What consumers liked about ""unlimited"" was what it meant for our pocketbooks: Your use is unlimited as far as the <i>bill</i> is concerned.<p>Metered pricing is an illusion, too. The illusion is that you pay for what you use. But of course that's not true. No one is proposing dropping monthly mobile fees, you notice. So 0 bytes != $0. Also, having a million dollars to blow will not magically get you unlimited bandwidth. All the limits of network contention with fellow users, and all the limits of the network itself, are still there. Sure, other people might USE less data. But also, the telco might BUILD less infrastructure as a result. So in a way metered is the worst of all worlds: You still get the implicit limits and unreliability of a mass consumer network, PLUS new explicit limits that allow the telco to wallet-rape you.<p>It is amazing to me that someone as smart as Bray looks at this tangled mess of competing, differently- (but not-very-differently-) crippled versions of paid network access and actually accepts the abstractions at face value and, worse, writes off the arguably slightly less realistic abstraction as unworkable when that very abstraction is the reason he draws a paycheck from a company that sells web advertisements. I mean.",1332787153
3758039,comment,3755418,3757477,1,0,roel_v,,,"DRM doesn't create artificial scarcity; DRM is an attempt at enforcing ownership rights, or contracts, depending on how you look at it. Producers want to maximize profit (just like producers of, say, bricks, or cars). To maximize that, they need to balance the highest price people with pay with lower prices that will entice more people to buy. For physical goods, a sale is a sale - somebody can't copy a car. But when somebody buys a song, and then copies it for his friends, that's a (potential) lost sale for the creator.<p>Artificial scarcity is when monopolies control the supply of a good to maximize prices (this is an example where pricing is influenced by supply). For example, the De Beers company for years controlled the supply of diamonds to keep prices high. Similarly, OPEC controls oil prices by throttling oil production. As you see, artificial scarcity is not connected to whether a good is physical or not. Even stronger, artificial scarcity is meaningless for digital goods, precisely because the marginal cost of production (how much does it cost to produce one extra item) approaches zero.",1332787140

Yet.<p>I don't even own a tablet of any kind, but the reasons the author gives for dismissing them are extremely short-sighted.<p>The reason people still use PCs for email, office applications, and graphics applications has absolutely nothing to do with how suited tablets are to those domains, and everything to do with market inertia. It takes time to convert to a new system of doing anything. As more and more people move to tablets, you can expect all of the author's points to change overnight.<p>There are plenty of office applications for iOS and Android. Off the top of my head, I know that much of the iWork suite and Google Docs both have native apps for their respective OSes, and I wouldn't be surprised in the slightest to find Microsoft Office on WP7. As people start to use these more at home, they'll slowly start to creep into offices as well. I don't know if Photoshop (or anything like it) exists on a mobile OS, but the Photoshop interface seems like it would translate almost perfectly to a touchscreen. Again, as more people start to use it, more offices will start to use it.<p>Games like World of Warcraft and Skyrim are targeted towards the PCs because that's where the hardcore gamers are. But games like Angry Birds and Cut the Rope are on tablets because that's where everyone else is. But as hardcore gamers move to tablets, game studios will start building their games for mobile OSes. John Carmack has already moved Id in this direction, releasing their latest game on iOS, and it's only a matter of time before others follow suit.<p>Ergonomics are almost a non-issue. Almost every tablet owner I've ever seen has a stand of some sort or another, and many who do serious work also have a keyboard.<p>Which brings us to his last point that a tablet with a keyboard is ""basically a desktop"". This is about as useful as saying that a mobile phone with a bluetooth headset is just a phone. That hasn't stopped bluetooth headsets or mobile phones from selling like crazy, and the same can be said for tablets and keyboards.<p>I doubt the computer is going to leave wholesale, but I think it's crazy to believe that tablets won't start taking huge chunks out of their market share within just a few short years.",1332785930

There have been quite a few studies about how the average driver can save on gas. A study by Edmunds summarizes the results best in an easy-to-read article. Basically, by altering your driving habits to reduce breaking, hard accelerating and speeding, you can see some serious fuel use improvements (one study saw 45% improvement, although Edmunds finds 35%). This is like Weight Watchers for your car, turning that 25 MPG beast to 34 MPG dieter.<p>The application, known as Open Road: Fuel Economy Assistant will track those behaviors for you so that you can actually measure your results. All you need to do is select your car from the database (or build you custom car) and press Start before you leave on your trip. As you drive, you will see live and trip averaged fuel economy. There is also a display for how much that individual trip cost you.<p>Check it out and give me some feedback!<p>PS. The iOS version will be released in a week or so.

3757864,comment,3756384,3757293,2,0,icebraining,,,"Sorry, but while I'm a great supporter of consumer rights - even of things that many US citizens consider appalling, like our 2 year minimum warranty - I think there's a point at which the responsibility lies on the person; it's a gray area, but I believe MU had more than surpassed that. Otherwise, we should start suing knife makers for not including a label that says ""Not to stab people"", newspapers for link-baiting titles that scare readers, or even simple bad designs.<p>Besides, and even if they did maliciously cause people to overlook the free option, that still isn't tricking people into paying. They didn't exactly charge your CC when you clicked on the Premium button; people were willingly paying for access to the content by inserting their CC information and getting what they were looking for. Offering a service for a price that you can get otherwise for free is not tricking people.",1332785178

3757861,comment,3754545,3757172,2,0,bad_user,,,"<p><pre><code>      I also think that your comment about people having \n      written top-down recursive descent parsers for a long \n      time without concrete historical reference is \n      suprising\n</code></pre>\nI do not have concrete knowledge or evidence about it, it was a statement based on intuition alone, sorry about that.<p>The reason why I said it is because the first parser I ever wrote (something like 10 years ago), was a top-down LL(k) parser and I had absolutely no idea about what I was doing, but in the end it worked. Many programmers are choosing LL(k) implementations for their manually-built parsers because they are so easy to reason about and build manually.<p>I was under the impression that C can be described as LL(k). C++ definitely can't be.<p>About a compiler's implementation, I realize that it can get really messy, especially for statically typed languages and especially if you want to add type inference to it. Also agree on optimization. But the thing is, most people don't need to build turing-complete languages or need efficient translations to the target representation, they just need to parse DSLs or network protocols (hence my original comment).",1332785139

I've been trying to figure out how to write Android games lately and this is the result - I've tried to make this as professional as more experienced developers and hope you guys like the result. I'm submitting this to HN because I'd love some feedback and because honestly, much of what I've learned about programming and software development over the past few years has been from this community.<p>I'd love feedback and comments. This is the second time I'm working on this game, and the first time I've released this to the Android store. People seem to like it so far, but suggestions would be great! Use the promo code 'HackerNews' if you'd like to upgrade to the full version for free - I'm really more interested in feedback than money from you guys.<p>Thanks!",1332784991

They've created a lot of random names/brands for their new phones, with no sense of continuation. It got confusing really fast, and I'm sure it has something to do with why their revenue took a dip in Q4 last year.<p>The One strategy seems to be working so far, but I'm worried they'll mess it up once again by launching 20 ""One"" phones throughout the year, at which point the One branding becomes as good as worthless.<p>Unfortunately, Samsung seems to be doing the same with the Galaxy name lately. They put it on everything from the crappy low-end phones and tablets, to the very best devices. What are consumers supposed to think about the brand?",1332784878

4964426,comment,4962975,4962975,3,0,robomartin,,,"I am repeating a portion of one of my comments here because I think it could be very useful to many Dropbox users.  If you implement this tonight you will, effectively, isolate your local data from Dropbox and any accidental loss at Dropbox will not result in total loss locally.  Of course, you are responsible for local backups.  If this gets up-voted to the top of the thread it might just help a lot of people avoid accidental loss of valuable data.<p>My approach for Dropbox on both Windows and OSX is to have the Dropbox folder on a dedicated drive partition.  If that is not possible, you can use a drive that will never see development work or any data that will need to be shared via Dropbox (business data, kid's pictures, etc.).<p>This forces a FILE COPY operation rather than a FILE MOVE operation when you drag-and-drop files into any Dropbox folder. Which, in turn, means that everything in Dropbox could be trashed tomorrow and nothing whatsoever would be lost locally.<p>For years I have gotten in the habit of having at least two physical drives on every machine:  System and Data.  If I don't want to create a dedicated Dropbox partition I can usually place my Dropbox folder in the System drive and this will trigger copy-on-drag-and-drop whenever dragging files in from the Data drive.<p>If you don't have separate physical System and Data drives (highly recommended) you can split a single drive into System and Data partitions or simply split-off a Dropbox partition in order to achieve the same results.<p><pre><code>    DROPBOX FEATURE REQUEST:

It takes a lot of energy to raise the average temperature of the earth by 4 C - much more than we are getting from the Sun ""within a few days"".  Stopping (most) of the Sun's light to reach the Earth would be an effective (if not crazy...) way of cooling down the Earth.  Adding a huge quantity of greenhouse gases is not going to turn the atmosphere into a one-way trap for radiation.  The physics involved in light being blocked by air-borne aerosol particles and that of the trapping of heat by greenhouse gases are different, and their effect, while going in opposite direction, are not the exact inverse one of another.",1356389874

Furthermore, there are resources, ideas, talent, and real solutions being developed in certain areas (even the US and Europe) which I feel should be collaborating with groups like this to better understand their needs and great a more global technology community. Likewise, there are no doubt some incredible, innovative solutions coming out of lesser-known technology centers with which the right localization could make a huge impact here in the Western World.<p>I'd be very interested to see a group acting as a ""liaison"" between these communities to help solve problems more efficiently. Example: You're developing a sensor network to measure rain levels across cell phone towers? I have an algorithm that can measure this data effectively and correct for error so you don't have to. We already do this today with the overload of SaaS startups -- you're building some monitoring platform? Use Librato to capture the metrics. You need a disaster response application that can aggregate data and display the most severely affected areas? Use Parse for the backend and OpenStreetMaps for the geo -- no need to do it yourself. If you're solving a problem, there is a 70% chance that somebody either solved it already, is currently trying to, and/or has a good idea about how to solve it.

At some point in time the company I founded held a spot in the top 300 websites.<p>To answer your question directly: It felt absolutely terrible. I had no idea on how to gain control of the wild horse that had left the stable unsaddled, with a jockey that was about as unprepared as could be. We did the best we could. We missed critical time-slots, dealt with all kinds of trouble as good as we could all the time knowing that we could - and should - do better.<p>Being CEO of such a company (at the peak > 20 employees on two continents) was more responsibility than I had bargained for. It took away time from those dearest to me, it stressed me out beyond belief and it gave me more experience in a few years than I'd built up in the decade before, both in a business sense and in a technology sense.<p>It made me weary of people, when you're having that level of success (newspaper cover photographs, TV appearances, the works) business wise you gain the attention of a lot of nice people, but also of a lot of not-so-nice people. They can be extremely hard to tell apart.<p>Suddenly you're responsible for two orders of magnitude more money than you've ever dealt with in your life. You worry more about your ability to pay your employees than you worry about your own health.<p>I could go on like that for a bit. Let's just leave it at if it wasn't planned that you were founder of a popular start-up it can wreck your life really well. Better make it something that you're aiming for consciously, then at least you will be somewhat prepared for the journey.<p>I would definitely not want to go through such a period of hyper growth without a means to control it again, I'm all for controlling the situation and maybe ending up a bit less successful than to end up investing too much of my most precious resource (time) into a company. Any company.<p>The price on other fronts is too high, which of course is a personal feeling but it is definitely where I stand today. That doesn't mean that I wouldn't want to be part of a success story, it means that I no longer want to be in an out-of-control situation and that I'll work really hard to maintain control, even if that's at the expense of some growth.

If you do, please slow down and read it all.  Then think about the idea of loosing, I don't know, a year's worth of work and blaming someone else for it.<p>Here it is (reformatted because HN does not have a much-needed block-quote markup):<p><pre><code>    My approach for Dropbox on both Windows and OSX is to have the 
    Dropbox folder on a drive that will never see development work, 
    even if that means creating a separate partition for it. 
    
    In most cases the system drive works fine (you do have separate 
    system and data drives on your machines, right?).
    
    This forces a COPY operation rather than a file MOVE if you 
    drag-and-drop files into any Dropbox folder. Which means that 
    everything in the Dropbox folder could be trashed tomorrow and 
    nothing whatsoever would be lost.
</code></pre>
Do this TODAY and unless you have massive local loss of data you don't have to worry about Dropbox loosing any of your data at all.  Not one bit.  If that isn't constructive I don't know what it.<p>Then I also said:<p><pre><code>    FEATURE REQUEST: It would be very nice if Dropbox client software 
    could have an option to auto-magically COPY files in and out of 
    Dropbox rather than allowing any files to be moved. 
    
    The above-mentioned hack works fine but it'd be nice to not have to 
    use it. Also, I'd venture to guess that most Dropbox users don't do 
    this, which opens them to unintended loss.
</code></pre>
In other words, if Dropbox could implement the suggested approach EVERYONE, engineer or not, would be spared of total data loss due to something going on at Dropbox.  Local data loss, of course, is still your responsibility.<p>And then, trying to understand further, I asked this:<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4963768"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4963768</a><p>So, I'll say that overall I've been pretty constructive.  If anyone adopts my approach of storing their Dropbox folder in an unused drive they are almost guaranteed that Dropbox can't loose their data.  That is worth money.<p>Please point me to a link or blog post with your immediate solutions to this problem.  I'd love to compare notes.  Maybe there's a better approach.  Always interested in learning.  I am sure there are lots of people who, tonight, might be interested in adopting your approach to ensuring that accidental data loss by a remote service of any kind does not mean total data loss locally.<p>Thanks.",1356388740

Windows on the south are great most of the time, but for the (few) hot summer days, you need something that prevents the sun from shining directly into your room.

4964282,comment,4962277,4962587,4,0,dkarl,,,"I agree with other posters that it's unfair to complain that the so-called ""entitlement generation"" is any less hard-working than the ones that came before, because when push comes to shove, when they realize the necessity, they do work just as hard.  That isn't to say that there haven't been generational changes, though.  This generation, and mine before it, was overpraised by its parents to a degree that rarely happened in previous generations.  When I read about people working hard to receive the praise of their parents, and feeling proud when praised by a teacher, I can't relate at all.  It sounds as old-fashioned as mending clothes or having three channels on TV.  Since when was praise a scarce, valued commodity?  My generation (born in the late seventies) lived in praise like fish live in water.  We don't feel it at all, but we feel its absence, keenly.<p>Also perhaps starting in my generation (though I missed it) and reaching its peak in the generation now coming to adulthood, was the phenomenon of training children to negotiate with their superiors.  Parents train their children that they can <i>always</i> get a little more by asking for it.  Argumentation, charm, and manipulation are implicitly encouraged.  As a result, kids who have expectations laid down by a boss and teacher count on being able to move those expectations simply by asking.  When a professor sticks to the grading standard described on the syllabus, many students are honestly shocked and bewildered.  They come in, show their distress, plead, negotiate, and get... nothing?  You <i>always</i> get <i>something</i> when you ask for it.  To people who haven't been brought up that way, that attitude surely sounds like entitlement, and indeed a student behaving that way decades ago would have been branded ""spoiled"" and mocked among the teachers, but now it is regarded as a socially normal behavior that can't be held against the individual student.<p>These are two of the new characteristics by which the ""entitlement generation"" is recognized.  I blame these things on the parents, not on the children, and I think they are both regressions, in the sense that they make our culture less pleasant and less efficient.  We have entirely lost the value of praise and at the same time obliged ourselves to produce and consume it incessantly.  Negotiation is an expenditure of time and energy, and it is wasteful for a professor, or a manager, to entertain a parade of underlings wheedling for exceptions to policy, and to penalize people who spend their time working instead of honing their appeals, when instead everyone might be doing useful work under a policy that is fairly and uniformly applied.<p>So, I think the ""entitlement generation"" is accurately diagnosed, though not justly blamed.  Their sense of entitlement is just an illusion that their parents programmed into them, an ultimately cruel one, designed to help them ""get theirs"" in a world of easy growth and riches.  It reflects their parents' view of the world as a place where wealth increases inexorably and is handed out most freely to the individuals who, via self-regard and self-assertion, contrive to appear to deserve it most.  Now they're adjusting to a world their parents did not prepare them for, and they're bound to look a little foolish at times, through no fault of their own.",1356386979

We've fortunately decided to only use our company domain emails for Dropbox for Teams, but because I can only be logged in to one Dropbox account at a time, it prevents me from using my personal account on my work computer.  Some may argue that's a good thing, but I don't particularly care about that clean personal/work separation[1] for the stuff in my personal Dropbox account.<p>Arguably by putting the ""for teams"" content in a completely isolated directory it solves the need for being able to sign in to multiple accounts at once[2], but there's still going to be some weirdness if my personal account is added as a team member of a work directory, since then you'd either start getting work stuff on personal machines or have to do per-device authorization which will be a nightmare for team administrators of even a dozen or so people.<p>The whole thing gets really nasty when you realize that DBFT adds something like 50-100GB/member.

It's simple and it works.  I've been constructive here.  If you implement my approach you should be safe.  Still, don't take my word for it, implement and verify.  That's engineering.<p>I have also, in another comment, posted about a feature request that might help insure that this does not happen to casual users:<p>Dropbox, if possible, should modify their client software such that files can only be copied in and out of Dropbox folders and never moved.

If a business owner is not capable beyond that they ought to be smart enough to hire a qualified IT service to help them manage and secure their systems.  If they do have in-house IT then data backup and security ought to be one of their top functions.<p>Private users are a little bit of a different story.

And, no matter how good of an engineer you might be, there is no way you would risk it all to offer some kind of an absolute no-loss guarantee.<p>The test is simple:  Would you, personally, be willing to be sued into absolute poverty for issuing that guarantee?  Probably not.<p>So, we can sit here in righteous indignation for me daring to suggest that users are ultimately responsible for their data and lie to each other or accept the reality that the reality, developer or not.<p>Down-vote away, but I am right.<p>If we go back to the very original article that this thread is about, the programmer who joined the startup team seems to have not had any explicitly-created local backup of the data in question.  He got lucky.  He said ""The client left all the files on my machines, so I didnt lose any personal data - it wasnt a catastrophic failure."".  That's luck, that is not planning.  So, he did OK, he talks about having to re-upload some 2GB of data to a new account.  He was off and running after that.  I can bet you that, unless he isn't very smart, he now has private local backup of his data in case something like this happens again.  And that's the right way to handle it.<p>Don't trust anyone with your data unless you can independently verify the ruggedness and reliability of their solution. Period.  If you did not do that, engineer or ""civilian"", total data loss is on you, not the service.",1356386458

Whether a particular needle is pathological depends on the haystack, too, so it could just be that there was a mismatch between the two in your case.",1356386420

Perhaps if you only ever really work on a very small set of systems, then this doesn't matter, but for those of us who frequently need to work on different systems and don't always have the ability to install new packages, grep does a fine job. In fact, it has a lot in common with vi here: you can (nearly) always count on having it available.",1356386413

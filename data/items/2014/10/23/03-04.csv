8496637,comment,8496202,8496202,0,0,r0h1n,,,"I would challenge the core of Ben Thompson&#x27;s argument, namely:<p>> <i>$50 billion for worldwide search advertising (of which Google captures a huge majority) sounds like a lot, but it’s only a small percentage of total ad spend, projected to be $545 billion in 2014. The vast majority of that spend is not about direct response – i.e. ads that spur you to make a purchase on the spot; rather most of the money is spent on brand advertising.</i><p>Essentially his point is direct response is ~10% of brand advertising, and that other players are better positioned than Gooogle to capture that.<p>But what if that ratio itself were a legacy assumption? And thus, why should we take his following statement at face value:<p>> <i>The idea behind brand advertising is to build “affinity” among potential customers.</i><p>I posit that brand advertising has traditionally been orders of magnitude larger than direct advertising because options for quality direct response advertising were limited. But thanks to the rise of the web and mobile, we&#x27;re now moving into an era where the line between brand advertising & direct advertising is blurring. Not just that, but the time/distance between a customer&#x27;s latent desires to purchase action is also shortening, thanks to 24x7 e-commerce.<p>In this world, why should direct response be 1/10th of brand advertising? Heck, why should direct response always be distinct from brand advertising?<p>Sure, companies will continue to run brand adverting, including ads masquerading as stories (advertorials once, &quot;native ads&quot; today). But the split (or even distinction) between direct response and brand advertising will continue to reduce.",1414036400

But I vehemently disagree with your stance that the sabotage of hardware is warranted or even that it&#x27;s a minor inconvenience.<p>Let&#x27;s take this from another point of view:<p>You purchase a device or some piece of hardware for a project which becomes useful to others and you decide to make the project marketable and release your own line. You source your components and one of them happens to have an FTDI chip that you believe legitimately came from the company. Your project is accepted by others and everyone is happy.<p>Then one day, your supplier decides to switch out a source for the chip in one of the components of your project to one that&#x27;s cheaper (the supplier may not suspect these are counterfeit). You don&#x27;t see any difference either as you haven&#x27;t tested it with the latest driver, which may not be out yet. The project is now shipped.<p>A new driver is released. An overwhelming number of customers now hit your support system saying the update has stopped your project cold. Rolling back the update has no effect. You don&#x27;t know which component caused the problem as your project uses several from different suppliers. It may take days or even weeks to track down the problem, but meanwhile, your customers grow angry.<p>This is now your fault and you&#x27;re left holding the bag.<p>This scenario need not be hypothetical, as this is just the same as GM &quot;fixing&quot; a problem with their ignition switch that has already claimed lives, but leaving the part number the same. This makes recalling a nightmare as there&#x27;s now no way to tell which cars are affected until the switch fails or someone dies again.<p>Just the same as there&#x27;s no way to tell which one of your project&#x27;s components carry counterfeit chips and you need to issue a recall for potentially 100K units since you don&#x27;t know which ones carry a counterfeit and there&#x27;s no software fix anymore as the chip is bricked. Your project is also potentially being used in mission critical infrastructure that cannot be shut down to do a test without costing a lot of money. Better hope no one follows &quot;best practices&quot; and updates the driver as it may also contain a security fix.<p>FTDI is well within their rights to protect their product. But are they doing the ethical thing by costing unsuspecting customers and potentially hundreds of other businesses that rely on their product valuable time and money? All for not knowing that somewhere along the supply chain, someone cut a few corners and got their chips from a counterfeiter? Should they be victims twice; once by the counterfeiter and again by the company?",1414036386

I would argue that a large additional part of the value of co-founders are that by having to at least convince someone else of your decisions, you avert the true howlers.

8496633,comment,8496202,8496202,0,0,adventured,,,"Google will continue to own search on mobile.<p>As such, their ability to monetize that avenue will remain intact. And it&#x27;s an extraordinarily lucrative position. It does not matter whether the ideal format for mobile ads is native or not, if it is then Google will adapt their search dominance to that approach and print money the same as they have been.<p>There has been no drop off in their mobile search position of power, and there&#x27;s nothing likely to displace their role there.<p>There&#x27;s no particular reason mentioned in the article, for why Google can&#x27;t benefit with the reach of mobile in regards to advertising. I saw no explanation for why search won&#x27;t get bigger with the mobile market&#x27;s growth in the next decade. Nor why Google isn&#x27;t just as well positioned as anybody to take a big cut of native ads via search.<p>The only way in which this is approximately peak Google, is that their PE ratio is likely to compress to half what it is now over the next decade, while their profits increase, leading to a flat stock for a very long time (as happens to most companies in their situation; eg Microsoft, Apple, IBM, Oracle, Cisco, Intel, etc).",1414036314

I just don&#x27;t care very much about remembering which movies to watch. That&#x27;s not to say I wouldn&#x27;t find any value in your site, just not enough to bother keeping around in my brain. Definitely not enough to sign up for.<p>So you need to either be less effort or more value.<p>It&#x27;s pretty tough to significantly raise the value of what you&#x27;re doing without fundamentally changing your idea. More integrations would help, and social features maybe (assuming you got the numbers for that to kick in), but ultimately it&#x27;s not really going to improve my life that much.<p>Finding ways to be less effort could be a bit more fruitful, though. As others have suggested, I&#x27;d remove the signup requirement or delay it as much as possible. Improving the UI would be a good idea, not so much in terms of how it looks, but in terms of making it as fast and low-friction as possible to use.<p>One angle you could try is to add a super simple hook to get people started. Like, the front page just says &quot;What&#x27;s your favorite movie?&quot; and an input box that does a search with auto-complete and live-updating results. When you pick the movie, it pops up a few recommendations. Each suggestion has &quot;have you seen? yes/no&quot;, if yes: &quot;did you like it? yes/no&quot; that feeds back into the recommendation system. If they haven&#x27;t seen it, a mini-blurb + &quot;show trailer&quot; + &quot;want to see? yes/no&quot;.<p>If you kept that all snappy with ajax and a reasonably fast backend, a person could feasibly visit your site for the first time and have 5-10 recommendations within a minute. Exactly the same service, same value proposition, just a lot less effort. I think if I had visited that website instead of your one I would probably have a movie list by now.",1414036243

Some might argue older languages like Erlang or Haskell are pretty trendy or perhaps Rust, but none of those have the current momentum of the first two and Google is behind the runtime for NodeJS and created Go.<p>On the data front, Hadoop is pretty trendy right now, but that&#x27;s based almost entirely off stuff that Google pioneered. Other NoSQL databases are pretty popular and, again, Google has its fingerprints all over that. Hell, a bunch of the NoSQL technologies even use LevelDB as a storage backend.<p>Distributed systems?

They were first with solutions to distributed consensus and they&#x27;ll likely be first with whatever new need develops simply because their scale will ensure that they hit problems before almost anyone else.<p>DevOps technologies like Docker?

Pronunciation needs a ton of work, but that&#x27;s not the only aspect that is measured when analyzing speech. The foreign policy article (linked in another comment) is overly critical, imho.<p>Detailed:<p>ILR LEVEL<p>He&#x27;s definitely at least an ILR 1+. He shows signs of ILR 2 characteristics (and is probably an ILR 2), but it&#x27;s hard to tell if he can sustain them in a wide range of contexts. While his pronunciation needs A LOT of work, the language itself is comprehensible to a sympathetic native listener. I strongly disagree with the Foreign Policy article that says it was &quot;terrible&quot;. I would say that it&#x27;s actually kind of amazing given that he&#x27;s the CEO of a huge company. I would roughly say that he is on par with a good / above average 3rd year student at a school with a really good Chinese program. The original article says 2nd year, but this would be a superstar 2nd year student who was either a heritage speaker or had spent a lot of time in China (e.g., as a homestay or study abroad).<p>DISCOURSE STRUCTURE AND STYLE<p>He is able to sustain the dialogue for a long time. He is able to circumlocute decently (this really opens up the ability to communicate), but I would really like to see his range of circumlocution. He is able to string together his sentences in moderately cohesive paragraphs. He does not demonstrate the ability to combine paragraphs cohesively at a high level (signs of an ILR 3), but I don&#x27;t think the tasks really required it.<p>His style of answering questions was very American -- very direct. I don&#x27;t think that a Chinese speaker who has lived exclusively in China (i.e., not educated or trained in the &quot;West&quot;) would answer the same questions similarly. In this case, I actually think that it&#x27;s best for him to answer in an American way even if he could answer in a Chinese style, but that&#x27;s a different and longer discussion.<p>Early on when he tells the story of his wife and her grandmother, he really comes across as quite charming.<p>GRAMMAR<p>He does decently enough. There are errors, but it&#x27;s not hard to understand what he is saying -- especially for a sympathetic native listener. The sample didn&#x27;t really demonstrate a wide range of grammar, but the tasks didn&#x27;t necessarily require a wide range. He is able to say complex sentences (i.e., two independent clauses), and he is able to speak in different timeframes (normally tenses, but Chinese tenses are not like English). This all points to a solid ILR 2, but grammar is definitely not the toughest part of Mandarin.<p>VOCABULARY<p>He has a decent vocabulary -- it&#x27;s solid for the task. I wonder what his vocabulary is like outside of the topics of personal bio information, Facebook, and Facebook business. If he wants to get to ILR 2+ or ILR 3, he will need to work on the accuracy and diversity of his vocabulary.<p>PRONUNCIATION<p>This is easily his weakest point. He has a HEAVY American accent. He mispronounces a lot of words. His tones are WAY off. He seems completely unable to say English loan words in Chinese (e.g., Facebook, Google, etc.). It&#x27;s actually kind of hard to listen to. That being said, I would say that it is all comprehensible to a sympathetic native listener.<p>SUMMARY<p>Overall, really good for someone who is not studying full time and has a very involved full time job. I wonder how much of it was practiced or rehearsed -- a lot of the questions are ones that he definitely _should_ practice (e.g., the story about why he started studying Chinese), since they are standard questions that would be asked to him and/or the Facebook CEO. Regardless, speaking in a foreign language to a large group of people is not easy, and he came across really well.<p>RECOMMENDATIONS<p>He can work on his pronunciation in several ways:<p>- Listen more. Even if it&#x27;s on in the background, it will help. Right now, I don&#x27;t think he has a good intuitive sense when he is mispronouncing a word.<p>- When working with a teacher, do lower level language tasks, and act like a native speaker whose voice/accent he likes. Research suggests that this lowers affective filters for pronunciation.<p>- Work with suprasegmentals with a pronunciation program that visualize what he&#x27;s saying. It can be enlightening.<p>- Practice over pronouncing words. If he does what he perceives as a &quot;caricature&quot; of pronouncing the word, he will probably be closer to accurate.<p>Other than that, listen more, read more, and I think he will become a rock-solid ILR 2 with room for growth if he wants it.<p>That&#x27;s my quick-and-dirty. I am very interested in the informed opinions of others.",1414033249

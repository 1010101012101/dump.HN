It appears as though the gains are too large and the incentives too strong for anyone to restrain themselves from pursuing it. Replacing intelligence has to be one of the most profitable business models ever created in the history of humanity. Someone is going to end up a trillionaire and a lot of people are going to end up unemployed (or worse?).<p>Am I the only one feeling pretty fatalistic about all of this stuff (AI/ML/Robotics/Automation) - it's probably going to end up killing us all. Not on purpose, of course (it's never the obvious things that ruin you) - but probably thanks to the law of unintended consequences that operate in complex, unpredictable systems like the Earth.<p>But I suppose we should keep working on it - because the alternate - a world without AI is just too damn boring.<p>Reminds me of a quote from ""Wired for War"":<p>A robotics researcher was asked for his thoughts on the end game for robotics.

Centralised VCSs are there to help you share your code with _other_ people.<p>Here's some problems I encounter everyday that git solves and SVN for instance doesn't.<p>1) I've been working on a feature since this morning but now there's a bug in production. I need to drop what I'm doing and come back to it when the bug is fixed.<p>2) I've implemented a feature but before I share it I want do some refactoring to clean it up. If I break something during the refactoring I want to be able to get back to the version that was working.<p>3) I'm working on integrating an old web API (SOAP hell) and I want to make a note of the workaround which is spread across several files. My tests aren't passing yet though so I don't want to share any code yet.<p>These are some examples of scenarios where git fits with _your_ workflow.

Speed - more than a feature, mainstream users tend to be least forgiving, slower apps grow slower.<p>2. Instant Utility - service has to be useful straight away, without lots of length configuration or importing data, use tricks to add utility (crawl web for initial population), example: Google Video took weeks to encode video...YouTube made it available ~immediately.<p>3. Voice - Attitude/personality from software/application. Example: Twitter 'Fail Whale' creates a ""voice"".<p>4. Less is More - example: Facebook at launch had a tiny amount of features versus now. Del.icio.us was limited but powerful... ""one little thing...get a lot of utility...""<p>5. Programmable - Allow other people to add value to your application. Read/Write APIs. Lets developers add data/utility and ""energy"".<p>6. Personal - User's own data / their personality establishes emotional connection between user and app. Makes them ""invested"" in the product.<p>7. RESTful - ?misuse of the term. All accessible resources in application have a clean URL where it can be accessed. Example: Twitter URLs easily understood from just the URL. (""<a href=""https://twitter.com/#!/fredwilson/lists"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/#!/fredwilson/lists</a>)<p>8. Discoverable - How do people find your app? Take advantage of search (SEO) and social media (virality) and build apps from the ground up to BE viral and optimized for search.<p>9. Clean - Application has focus per page and functionality on each page is limited. Lots of space, big fonts. Don't let the user get it wrong. Example: Tumblr login (""<a href=""http://www.tumblr.com/login"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tumblr.com/login</a>) - ie. nobody won't know what to do.<p>10. Playful - Help users have fun and incentives for the user to behave in ways you want. Example: Weight Watchers has a game dynamic with setting goals and achieving weight loss / LinkedIn & Facebook & Twitter with friend/follower counts / FourSquare badges and mayorship.",1341492466

Of course it eventually collapsed due to internal and external pressure, but communism was not ousted due to a mass civil uprising (the wars were largely due to the policy of forcing a pan-Yugoslavian identity independent of pre-existing ethnic differences).

The server records both the push token, the logged in user and the user agent string sent by the app.<p>When a logged in user views an event page on <a href=""http://lanyrd.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lanyrd.com/</a> (e.g. <a href=""http://lanyrd.com/2012/oscon/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lanyrd.com/2012/oscon/</a> ) we check to see if they have any push tokens associated with their account. If they do, we show them a ""Push to your iPhone"" button - but we vary the copy and the icon depending on their user agent string, so if they're running an iPad the button says ""Push to your iPad"" instead, with a wider icon.<p>When they push the button, we send a custom URL to our app in a standard push notification, along with a command to store the corresponding event in our app's offline cache.<p>If the user has the Lanyrd app open, the event page is displayed instantly - which is a pretty cool effect (click a button on a web page on your laptop, watch the app on your phone instantly update). If they don't have the app open they get a standard notification prompt which, when activated, will launch the app and send it to the corresponding event page.",1341490401

Think of points in the board game <i>Settlers of Catan</i> (or choose your favourite): do they have any ""basis in reality""? In some ways yes, in most ways no; and in any case there is something seriously wrong with the person who sees the points in the game as belonging to the material world, rather than belonging to a social field of interactions. Religions are about authentic living, meaningfulness, mindfulness, and reminding yourself with ritual of that which is most important. They are about experience for its own sake, especially experience which invokes the Other. I understand the temptation to reify Otherness in the supernatural and/or look for it in the material; in that sense I agree that some religions strive to have a basis in reality. I would not characterize it as a universal trend or a universally applicable question: just to take the three Abrahamic religions, it applies extremely well to Christianity, only imperfectly to Islam, and extremely poorly to modern Judaism.<p>If I knew a way to help people feel whole which was not religious, I would pursue that instead.

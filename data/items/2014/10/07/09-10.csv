For each competition a jury selects a problem and then everybody can try to solve this problem as nice and clean as possible for his preferred programming language / paradigm. The best solutions are then judged / commented on by experts and put on a website. By this you would have perfect examples how each language / paradigm deals with a certain problem.<p>This is something I miss from the discussion: for each computational problem there is one tool which is &quot;best&quot; to solve it. Sometimes it is some esoteric Haskell magic and sometimes it is some lowlevel C++ bit manipulation.",1412675833

It&#x27;s much more quiet, fewer distractions and I tend to be far more productive than during the day. Much easier to get into the &#x27;zone&#x27; at night than during the day.<p>As a result when I&#x27;m not on the clock for someone I tend to sleep very erratically, get up at the weirdest times and go to bed at even weirder ones. When I&#x27;m inspired the hours just fly by. I forget to eat/drink. This usually is not a huge problem but it can take a while to re-sync with the rest of the world when I have to. Not having a watch (and not compulsory checking the phone) really helped me to no longer think of this as a big deal. But there are still days when I freak out and go &#x27;seven already???&#x27; thinking it must be early afternoon.<p>I also tend to completely forget what day of the week it is which can lead to interesting situations when having to deal with authorities and other companies. Arriving at the municipality office on a Sunday is definitely not going to get you served.<p>I think there is a small error in one sentence in the article, at some point it reads &quot;When the subjects woke, they tended to say that they’d slept better when they’d been together. &quot;, I think given the rest of the sentences around there that a &#x27;than&#x27; should have been present before the &#x27;when&#x27;.",1412675813

I can overcome the syntax diabetes.<p>I&#x27;d like to do functional programming, I&#x27;m doing server/web based stuff mostly. I&#x27;d like the language to have a big(large) ecosystem. Clojure is fun and all, but it&#x27;s more or less a hackernews language. There are only a few serious businesses using it. It also lacks a web framework like Play!. Same goes for Haskell.

8420317,comment,8415647,8419365,0,0,cmdkeen,,,"Simply not true - there are plenty of areas where consistently good returns are generated, however they aren&#x27;t the best and they aren&#x27;t <i>too</i> consistent.<p>The first hedge funds were successful because there was little competition, they could conduct things like arbitrage because no-one else was. The problem is that such strategies don&#x27;t work generally with scale, and there is so much money in hedge funds that they can&#x27;t all conduct such activity profitably and thus the opportunity is overcrowded.<p>Some active traders maintain their advantage by having such a high built in advantage that they have effectively monopolised a specific area, often through using technology and data mining. They are happy to sit on their strategy and keep reinforcing it to keep that advantage.<p>Finally there is the successful strategy of actually <i>investing</i> in companies over the long hall. Hedge funds don&#x27;t do this, people like Warren Buffet do. Surprisingly few companies, even pension investors, properly do this (riding through bad patches without firing the investors for instance) and thus there isn&#x27;t nearly as much competition as you would think - very few companies genuinely invest over a 10 year time frame for instance.",1412675795

8420314,comment,8420060,8420060,0,0,zorbo,,,"Having programmed a lot of OO in Python and PHP (yeah, yeah, I know, but its OO implementation is actually rather good), I always felt OO was a pretty good way of doing things...<p>Until I hit the Java scene. Boy, is it a big mess. There I found some of the worst unreadable, unmaintainable, ungrokable, complex and brittle code I&#x27;ve ever seen. And that&#x27;s not an exception, rather it&#x27;s the standard. I suddenly understood why Python&#x27;s logging implementation is such a disaster. It was ported from Java. I&#x27;m sorry if this offends the java programmers, but it feels like idiomatic java is just abstractions piled on abstractions upon patterns, in the hope of somehow making things more understandable or robust. It doesn&#x27;t.<p>I&#x27;ve always thought of OO as simply abstraction and encapsulation. Functions on steroids, if you will. If something doesn&#x27;t fit the OO paradigm, I don&#x27;t try to shoehorn it in (which patterns seem to especially made for).

8420306,comment,8414180,8420205,1,0,ObviousScience,,,"I think we both know that if I had made the implication in the reverse direction, everyone here would be lecturing me in response on how I shouldn&#x27;t be othering people I disagree with.<p>I think the response to me has shown that people weren&#x27;t objecting to the question I asked and instead because I dared to call out such behavior from a feminist, instead of Approved Bad Guys(tm). Read up to where someone posted a study agreeing with me to tell me I was wrong.<p>I have two objections to her comment:<p>1. It&#x27;s empirically untrue, and that does us no service if we&#x27;re concerned with actually solving the problem. As the study cited to me points out, many of the problems related to sexism are actually caused by confounding factors in the community, and not necessarily just because a few problematic actors are sexist. Similarly, my point was that solutions are often about addressing these confounding factors, such as reducing the undue influence of problematic actors (eg, posting way more than most people).<p>2. No, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s okay for feminists to use propaganda tactics regularly used by groups to &quot;other&quot; people they don&#x27;t like just because we agree with the goals the feminists have, and I think such poor behavior should be called out when anyone does it - including people we agree with. We may just have a difference of opinion here on what&#x27;s acceptable, but you&#x27;ve been incredibly dismissive of me simply having a different opinion on what&#x27;s appropriate conduct and attacked me personally for it. I regard this, too, as poor conduct.<p>I think at this point, everyone responding to me has shown two things:<p>1. They&#x27;re not concerned if &quot;feminism&quot; (no one even seems to be clear what that means in this context) actually fixes the named problem of having safer spaces for women in online communities, they&#x27;re supporting the claim for ideological reasons, not because it&#x27;s true. All the data actually suggests that changes to the community orthogonal to the concerns of feminism have the dominant effect on the comfort level of women in the community, because they serve to amplify or diminish the role of problematic actors (of several stripes).<p>2. People who are supporting her comments aren&#x27;t interested in actually engaging with others, and will use all kinds of fallacies, irrationalities, and outright abuse to try and shout down opinions that don&#x27;t fit with with their chosen ideology.<p>I think we should expect better from people.",1412675597

Wow, what a rant.<p>I don&#x27;t mind the invective, and I&#x27;m becoming more skeptical of OOP the more I see larger-scale FP apps work. Mutable state and hidden dependencies are killing us. But I do not like the way this essay is arguing its case. Please do not trot out famous people, tell me their ideas, and then show me how things did not work out for them.<p>Frankly, I couldn&#x27;t care less what Alan Kay thinks of OOP. Or Bjorne. Or any of the others. I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;re nice people, and probably a million times smarter than I am. What I&#x27;m interested in is this: why do people who know multiple ways of creating a solution pick OOP? And does it fulfill the implied promises it makes <i>to those folks</i>?<p>The classic example is the statement &quot;OOP is required for creating and maintaining large systems, because it forces developers to think about where things go first, ahead of what the system does.&quot;<p>So here we are presented with a problem: large-scale systems with lots of developers have a difficult time working without a clear definition of where everything goes and how it works together. From my experience that seems like a reasonable problem to consider. So let&#x27;s talk about that problem, how OOP helps, and how OOP falls down on the job.<p>Repeat and rinse. Then we get a list of real-world problems that choosing OOP is supposed to help with. We also can start creating some success criteria for both OOP and non-OOP projects.<p>Otherwise, our arguments get caught up in personalities and theory-of-the-universe crap that doesn&#x27;t really go anywhere. I can line up a dozen experts, cherry-pick some quotes, and rant away. A person disagreeing with me can do the same. Then we can each talk about how the theoretical system the other guy&#x27;s way of solving things is built on a shaky foundation. The other guy will demonstrate that this is incorrect by citing an example. It&#x27;s not productive.<p>The reason it is not productive is that it is trying to make a universal case based on theory, as if programming were some sort of extension of calculus or geometry. Yes, I understand the association with category theory and such, but programming is the act of multiple humans coming together and creating some better way of doing things for another group of humans. Yes, languages are mathematical, but <i>programming</i> isn&#x27;t. You want better programming, you&#x27;d better start listing out a bunch of ways humans screw the pooch when they&#x27;re trying to make stuff, then try to help them stop doing that. You don&#x27;t trot out the set theory books. Wrong answer.<p>Think in terms of machine language. At the end of the day, bits gotta go somewhere -- both data bits and coding bits. Instead of trying to say &quot;well, we always do things this way because $FamousAuthorX told us&quot;, it might be much better to say &quot;we have this process that allows us to dynamically change the method of grouping that proceeds like so&quot;<p>This is much better because it starts with the problem and lets the solution evolve. Instead of starting with already knowing the solution and then just taking the problem and a big hammer and making it all work [insert long argument for mixed-mode languages here, like Ocaml or F#]<p>ADD: I also note that developers love making things complicated, and OOP is like a massive playland where you can run off and make complicated stuff all day long. Become your inner architecture astronaut. This is extremely difficult for many to resist.",1412674934

Many people here have some romantic vision of Cuba that is influenced by well-designed Cuban operations to accomplish exactly what they&#x27;re accomplishing: influencing gullible left-leaning Americans to support Cuba. I remember when I was at the University of Houston, there was a Cuban Friendship Committee that held Cuban &#x27;cultural&#x27; events for students. Interestingly many of the students invited to those events were majors in areas of rather strategic interest: journalism students. Interesting even more so were the free and discounted trips to Cuba being covertly offered to select students. The leader of this group even assisted with obtaining Cuban travel permits from the Cuban government. Now just why would that &quot;Friendship&quot; committee be so friendly? I have first hand experience because I was both a journalism student, a Reuters contract photojournalist and the photo editor of the student newspaper; so I was invited to these Friendship events almost constantly. This was back in 1995-1997. There certainly wasn&#x27;t any other &#x27;student&#x27; organization offering free trips for &#x27;cultural&#x27; exchange, except for Hillel, but that&#x27;s another discussion altogether..<p>The point is that there is a powerful clandestine and covert effort by the Cuban government to manipulate American influencers to present the image of Cuba that is so frequently transmitted. It&#x27;s exceptionally effective; just read some of the comments posted on this very thread.

But, you might have something for the other 19 &quot;users&quot; that doesn&#x27;t bring the average value up to that scale.

Local walking maps, restaurants, bars, local gigs for this evening. Some explanations about local tipping norms, buying train tickets and maybe a one page phrasebook.

IE, if you have 1,000 active users in a city on any given day, that&#x27;s enough to make something.<p>In fact, I think it&#x27;s something that&#x27;s accessible for people to have a go at. Even authoring a local guidebook for your city (provided it is not New York or somesuch, in this case, pick an area).

Privacy-awareness in East-European countries is impressive, it&#x27;s on the top of their minds because they <i>know</i> what can happen if you let it run loose.<p>On the other hand, I read a few years ago (and I don&#x27;t have much reason to suspect much has changed though I&#x27;d love to hear I&#x27;m wrong) about a village in East-Germany that was entirely in control by neo-nazis. That was scary to find out such things are actually going on today (this was before I heard about Greece&#x27;s Golden Dawn and how they run refugee camps). When travelling, I was warned about the are that people that looked too &quot;foreign&quot; might have a bad time (I suppose when coloured or Arab, me and my travel companion were both very white, Dutch and half-German).<p>Maybe it&#x27;s just an anecdote or some small isolated issues blown out of proportion, but this is what also plays in the back of my mind whenever I consider they&#x27;re learning from past mistakes.<p>Either way, no throwing babies out with the bathwater, we can both support and learn from their historical awareness, as well as be vigilant about rising intolerances.",1412672898

That&#x27;s natural, and fine. I feel the same way sometimes. It&#x27;s clear that others here do too.<p>Where you&#x27;re hitting turbulence is rationalising that emotional response and building hard logic on top of that soft foundation.<p>It&#x27;s actually fine for feminists to appropriate values. It doesn&#x27;t stop anyone else using them. Sure, we can resent the implication that we don&#x27;t hold those values, but the way to deal with that insecurity is by proving it to yourself.

The possibility of getting caught limits what you can do. Isn&#x27;t the idea here to remove this limitation, to open up for experimenting with more things? This is certainly a good way to find out how to manipulate human bodies with drugs, but it does seem to be at the (cynical) expense of the guinea pigs.",1412672854

And there is no reason you can be given a fifth?

Low supplementation, particularly under a doctor&#x27;s care, is probably all to the good.<p>I&#x27;d bet most of this is already going on.<p>An addendum: and we all know it.<p>Look at the muscle Barry Bonds put on in an off-season in his 30s.<p>Look at Kobe Bryant, going for surgeries (and what else) abroad, coming back from torn acls and a 3rd degree torn achilles, commonly a career-ending injury.  At age 34 <i>and</i> the 14th highest minutes every played.<p>Look at Ray Lewis and his fucking miraculous recovery from a torn triceps.<p>Look at Adrian Peterson tearing his acl and mcl, then coming back within a year to break a 28 year old rushing record.<p>What do all these guys (and there are dozens more examples) have in common?

The &quot;sovietization&quot; of Castro&#x27;s party took years.<p>It took two years before Castro proclaimed his government socialist, it wasn&#x27;t until 1965 that his party became the Communist Party of Cuba.<p>Eventually they became dogmatic Leninist, but substantial parts of the party, including Castro came to Soviet style socialism out of necessity. That&#x27;s not to say that there weren&#x27;t many of them that clearly had socialist leanings of various types before that, but the Castro regime was the making of the unholy marriage of rejection by the US and a toxic embrace by the Soviets.<p>There may have been less of a gap between theory and practice in Cuba than elsewhere, in that the elite appears to have been less greedy and reinvested more in actually making peoples lives better, but it&#x27;s still an oligarchy with drastic class differences <i>reinforced</i> by the party, rather than fought by it.",1412672697

Most people that write wistfully about Cuba have never lived there. As much as a police state as the U.S. has become, you can still write blog posts against the government without ending up in prison. Try that in Cuba. Remember Che? Brutally murdered opponents in the name of the &#x27;people.&#x27; The love-fest some people have with Cuba is astounding. The Cuban Intelligence agency does a great job of propaganda. Blaming the US embargo for the actions of Castro&#x27;s government brutality is stupid. Are we next going to suggest that North Korea would be a friendly place if it weren&#x27;t for those pesky South Koreans? The blame America for everything meme is starting to get old. People don&#x27;t risk their lives trying to escape the Dominican Republic on a raft made from old car tires. Why is that? If the DR is poorer than Cuba, why aren&#x27;t rafts washing up in the Florida Strait filled with Dominicans? How would Cuba have been doing without the decades of subsidies from the USSR? That experiment in total communism would have fallen flat on its face. The Soviets had a near 100% literacy rate and &#x27;universal&#x27; health care, yet you ask anyone over the age of 50 if they would want to live under the Soviets again and it would be an overwhelming &#x27;No.&#x27; Let&#x27;s ask the Polish what they think of Soviet communism.. Any place where the answer to dissenting thought is arrest and imprisonment is a terrible place -- no matter how many doctors there might be. US prisons have universal health care too, but that doesn&#x27;t mean we would want to live there. When Cuba has free and open elections, then maybe I&#x27;ll change my tune. But when the people have no voice, then we should not be rationalizing a government just because the kids score well on a math test and it&#x27;s cheap to get diabetes medicine. I would invite anyone here who thinks Cuba is so great to go live there. Defect to Cuba and let us know (assuming you can) how you&#x27;re doing in 5 years.",1412672528

It's going up against GNU grep, which is a highly tuned regex engine, which is very fast.  The ack guys make the argument that ack is faster because it doesn't search stuff you, the developer, don't care about, which in my estimation is horseshit.  Try it yourself, I threw a regex at my email spool from the 90s which is about 128M.  I made sure it was in disk cache first and then did:<p><pre><code>    chunky:~$ time egrep -c -i '(d|m|j)ingle' RMAIL

He doesn't ask about decimals with different numbers of decimal places; he doesn't ask about the meaning of the equal sign. Maybe it's because he doesn't know that he needs to ask these things. That is a kind of knowledge he didn't need in his old profession and that he does in his new one. Maybe as KA grows, he will improve on this point and he will bring in people with this knowledge.

First you take the probability of a woman being over 6 feet tall (say 1%) and then you multiply that by the probability of being a woman (say, 50%). Now you have the probability of being a woman AND being over six feet tall scaled to the overall size of the total ""universe"" (being a human being). Then, if you divide this by the probability of being over 6 feet tall (say, 4%) you'll get the probability of being a woman AND being over six feet tall scaled to the universe where everyone is over six feet tall (12.5%).",1343441727

Have people missed it?<p>Its been the same since all the bleating went on about fake designer labels in the 80's. You are not likely to buy a fake Le Whatever t-shirt if you can afford the real thing. Who buys fake Rolexes? Its not the millionaires who buy the originals is it? If you are a rich person with fake designer labels, you look like a prat. There for, mostly, no loss. The whole thing is basically a lie. There is very little actual loss due to piracy.<p>Look, most people spend all their money each month. If not spend, then allocate. Which means they have a finite amount to spend. So, if they have to buy that which they down load for free, that means they don't buy something else. Maybe the would just do with out. Often with music it ends up not mattering. I mean, out of 100 CD's how many would you listen to regularly? How many never? What about those who have ""illegal"" downloads? Most of it you never listen too, right? I could go on.<p>So, the assumption that these industry Muppets make that all the recordings they see downloaded represents lost money is utterly ridiculous. And they must know that.<p>And here is why: Music faces massive competition for our finite funds. We spend less in percentage terms because now there is so much more to spend our money on than there was back in the 90's, 80', 70's, and so on. As the decades went by, the competition increased and the music industry got squeezed out, and that is a huge problem. They see there isn't really much they can really do about it, so what we have now is the final desperate tactic of blaming their former customers who chose to spend more of their money else where.<p>Ooooo, bit of a rant?

That's why it takes us 4-5 years to graduate.<p>> This is the line that separates a very good, but very green programmer from a guru-level senior.<p>So, you want senior level, but you're willing to start from scratch by pulling people who have no degrees. How can you have any guarantee of a formal knowledge base? Why the hell would you want to waste time fixing things like style and teaching people software engineering (which isn't only about shipping product that you are so gun-ho about)? You do know software engineering is in most computer science curriculum.<p>> They will be rough around the edges on the CS side, but that's something you can fix with experience and training.<p>Something you wouldn't have to do if you pulled college students, like me for example.<p>> You ship product. You ship it a lot, either on your own, or you do it as part of internships with other companies, or you join active open source projects with strong leadership. You do not learn this from hacking on class projects or assignments.<p>I fail to see how that makes getting a CS degree worthless. It says that either a lot of junk is put out, or you are in the parcel business. Shipping code is something for product managers and sales people if you're working for a company. The Internet if you aren't. If you think that's what separates the men from the boys, see points 1-3. I wonder why I don't see a lot of books on shipping code when I go on Amazon or to the local book store... I wonder why... I guess we can all just forget about good software if ""shipping code"" is the grand answer...<p>Yeah, I've done an internship with a company and guess what? There are people without CS degrees that are commercially certified in the languages they develop in and suck. The code they ship is buggy with hardly any input validation and doesn't work according to customer requirements. There are people that don't even know OOP concepts, or even basic design patterns. They don't produce any UML diagrams because they use their own ass backwards design notation and they don't have a consistent development methodology.<p>> Lots of hustle along with experience are much more valuable than academic knowledge.<p>Except with my academic knowledge I don't need to be hustled or have basic, remedial things fixed. I can also identify problems with existing systems and solve them competently. I don't need to be ""taught"" basic practices. I may need to be refreshed from time to time, but I know ""what"" I need refreshing on and ""why"".<p>> And what percentage of CS graduates do you think will commit all of the above sins?<p>A low percentage. I've committed some, but my professor caught them and I fixed them. I don't have to be told those habits are bad by my boss. I don't need to be told how to do things efficiently. But hey, if you want to spend time fixing problems that programmers are clueless on, go ahead. So I ask the same question, how many programmers do you think can identify such problems and fix them themselves?<p>> Why wouldn't I value real world experience that actually trains shitty habits like this out of people?<p>Because I don't need real world experience to train those shitty habits out of me.",1343441093

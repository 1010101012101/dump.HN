In most straightforward implementation it&#x27;s essentially turing machine with microcode as state table and tape replaced by rest of the CPU. Various enhancements and modifications are possible which end in having essentially full-blown CPU for processing microcode, but even in that case one thing is critical for the term: the microcode only handles control functions (sequencing) and does not directly process data.",1431385066

See for example JSF 2.1 and CDI 1.2. They were intermediate quick releases between major Java EE versions.<p>Even the platform spec itself can have a MR. Currently there&#x27;s an MR for Java EE 7 in the works. See <a href=""https://java.net/downloads/javaee-spec/JavaEE_7_Platform_MR_Candidate.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://java.net/downloads/javaee-spec/JavaEE_7_Platform_MR_...</a><p>Because it&#x27;s a spec, naturally more consideration has to go into it. Many implementations depend on it to be stable. In case of Spring there&#x27;s only one Spring. Take it or leave it. Not having a spec behind you can be an advantage (change things whenever you want), but is a disadvantage as well (the implicit specification of how things work is in the code, but Java is not declarative and it&#x27;s always a guess if specific behavior is just an implementation side-effect or an intended one).<p>Even changing things whenever you want can be a disadvantage. A spec naturally favors stability, which means I can run my old code with minimal or no changes at modern Java EE. Try that for regular open source libraries (be it from within the Java EE universe, Spring universe, or whatever). Chances are that the APIs and config files have changed 10 tens in the meantime.",1431384844

9528382,comment,9526602,9528293,0,0,EvanAnderson,,,"That&#x27;s a problem that has to be worked around in a system with a centralized control architecture, too. Presumably there will be some safety systems acting autonomously in the car (latency and network reliability being what they are) and those systems will be gamed.<p>To boil my position down: I want to see an Internet-style architecture rather than a &quot;Bell System&quot; style architecture. I&#x27;d rather have &quot;smarter cars&quot; with &quot;dumber roads&quot; and as little mandated centralized control as possible.<p>In a decentralized system attestation of identity (likely tied to one or more existing civil methods) and attribution of actions observed to individual vehicles would definitely have to be a component. Any identity system cannot approach 100% reliability, but if every car is able to report to law enforcement (or private driver reputation-tracking networks) the observations it makes of the behavior of other drivers I would expect that &quot;cheaters&quot; would be visible as statistical outliers.<p>&quot;The car to my left doesn&#x27;t answer as a known transponder challenge/response in the vehicle reputation database I am querying. I am going to assign a lower priority to any non-emergency events it is reporting to me.&quot;<p>&quot;Hey-- that car just started broadcasting a different transponder response. Something is really, really funny where. I&#x27;m going to alert cars in my proximity that something is up so that they can physically identify the car with their LIDAR / imaging / etc. and treat it cautiously. If enough funny-business occurs eventually law enforcement will be alerted and physical interdiction can occur.&quot;<p>&quot;According to the vehicle database I&#x27;m subscribed to this car always traverses statistically similar routes 15% more quickly than other cars. Other cars in its proximity on these routes have their traversal slowed as compared to their traversal of the same routes when this care is not present. It sounds like funny business is at-play. I&#x27;m going to cast a vote for this car to be more likely to be subject to an inspection.&quot;<p>etc.<p>I&#x27;d prefer such a world to not involve the ability for totalitarian (or-- ahem-- certain republics who purport to be democratic in nature and are filled with power-mad bureaucrats conducting dragnet surveillance) to use these tools for public surveillance, but I&#x27;m resigned to that fate. Self-driving cars themselves aren&#x27;t a threat to freedom, but the infrastructures of surveillance and control that will grow up around them almost certainly will be.<p>Freedom aside, whatever happens is going to end up being an information security nightmare. Too many disciplines who have never had any exposure to information security are going to intersect with this technology, and each of those intersections is going to be ripe with all kinds of interesting threats and failure modes. People will be inconvenienced. People will be robbed, physically assaulted, and violated. People will die. I have no illusions that criminals are unsophisticated and that these systems won&#x27;t be attacked in every possible way.",1431384817

9528218,comment,9526471,9527936,0,0,jude-,,,"The intuition is that the cryptocurrency miners act as a large decentralized first-come first-serve notary for the transactions they append to the blockchain.  If a peer submits a valid transaction and it gets included in the blockchain, it means the majority of the other peers have accepted the transaction as valid and will continue to serve it to other peers.  As a side-effect, any data within a transaction gets included and served as well, and (this is where the proof-of-work comes in) it cannot not be retroactively altered without first retroactively altering the blockchain itself.<p>Onename leverages this fact to bind your human-readable username to the hash of your passcard in a first-come, first-serve basis.  When you sign up for a passcard, the (username, passcard_hash) tuple gets submitted to the blockchain as part of a valid transaction, so that once the transaction gets accepted, the peers will continue to preserve this information.  There&#x27;s similar process for changing name ownership and revoking names and credentials.<p>The trust you place in the validity of Onename records on the blockchain comes from the steep cost of silently altering it.  You have to launch a 51% attack to alter it at all, and you have to alter <i>every</i> local copy of the blockchain without drawing notice to do so silently (otherwise, a fork will be observed).  This means once you&#x27;re committed the requisite information in a transaction, there&#x27;s a good chance it will persist.<p>The situation is much more fluid with PGP, since the number of endorsers can be somewhat smaller than number of miners, and there&#x27;s no guaranteed &quot;paper trail&quot; of what bindings have have processed (thereby making silent alterations easier to come by).  Moreover, trust is not transitive--Alice trusting Bob and Bob trusting Charlie does not imply that Alice trusts Charlie--so the degree of trust you get from a web-of-trust is hard to quantify even in the absence of malicious behavior.  This in turn makes it hard to reason about the strength of your endorsements, as compared to the strength of your adversary&#x27;s claims against you.<p>At the end of the day, Onename gives me the ability to say &quot;I am jude-, and my passcard is ...&quot; in a non-repudiable manner, and I can quantify how strong of a testament it is by measuring the blockchain&#x27;s hashing power versus my adversary&#x27;s hashing power.  The passcard itself is stored elsewhere (but its hash is incorporated into the blockchain), but the passcard can include information like your public keys, your identities on other services, hashes of digital assets you created (e.g. pictures, documents, etc.), and so on.",1431382642

Yes, it was down to Fujimori.<p>It&#x27;s true that Fujimori is in jail right now, but not for corruption.  He&#x27;s in jail for his overzealous approach to the antiterrorist campaigns that took place in the early 90s.<p>When the Sendero Luminoso (Shining Path, a Maoist terrorist group that nearly managed to overthrow the state in the late 80s/early 90s) were at their peak, Fujimori came to power.  Very shortly thereafter, the SL hijacked the Japanese embassy on a night when they had a big event on, kidnapping everyone from the Japanese ambassador to the directors of large Japanese corporations (Toyota, Sony, etc.).<p>Fujimori ordered a replica of the embassy to be built in the desert, and special forces trained there for weeks in preparation to storm the embassy.  The operation was a great success, the kidnappers were killed, only one soldier died, none of the hostages died.<p>High on this amazing success, Fujimori ordered more campaigns against SL, and managed to pretty much eradicate them from the country.  Two campaigns, however, did not go as planned.  One at a university called La Cantuta, one in a poor district of Lima called Barrios Altos.  Innocent people died in these campaigns, which had received his direct, personal go-ahead.  That is what he went to trial for, and the reason he&#x27;s in jail now.<p>Fujimori took over when the state itself was a failed state: hyperinflation of both the old Sol and the new Inti, had all but destroyed everyone&#x27;s savings, political processes were sclerotic, there was enormous bureaucracy, no foreign investment, etc.  Fujishock, as it has come to be called, was the process of undoing all this.  Fujimori created the new Sol currency which has been a very stable currency ever since.  Parliament was closed and replaced with one single congress and a super-simple process of election that elects both the percentage of parliamentary representatives and the president.  Bureaucrats were sent home and the machinery of government simplified a great deal.<p>A lot of investment went into infrastructure, too: where it used to take more than a day for a farmer to take his produce to the nearest city, it can now take just 3 or 4 hours, which means they don&#x27;t just go once a year but once every month, which puts them more in touch with the market and more responsive to price signals.  Many things that would take forever to start (companies, brand registrations, etc.) can now be done online in a couple of days.  The country has seen between 6 and 9% annual growth ever since the mid-90s, reducing poverty from over 50% to around 20% today.",1431382413

I should prioritize my own over the rest of the world, so it&#x27;s ok to fuck everyone over as long as I and my family are happy. This is how a lot of world seems to operate. You wouldn&#x27;t have companies polluting rivers, or shoppers cheating you on every occasion possible, if those people were not prioritizing themselves and their families over other humans. It&#x27;s easy to rationalize the harm by saying to yourself, &quot;I have kids to feed, so fuck those other people, I need that money&quot;.<p>> <i>On top of that, these selfish people expect/demand that their employees work infinitely harder than they do on a ROI basis. Example: A start up founder may worked twice as many hours as the founding engineer but the founder stands to make a lot more than twice as much when the company has it&#x27;s liquidation event.</i><p>While this may apply to many startups, it doesn&#x27;t apply to SpaceX and Tesla, and it&#x27;s disingenuous to discuss them in such terms. The ROI on electrification of transport, switching everyone away from fossil fuels and enabling life on another planet is <i>fuckton lot for every single human being</i>.

Once you get beyond the new jargon, you find it wraps a concept which is 95% compatible with something you&#x27;ve been using for years.<p>That the Rust team seems to find no value in this kind of naming, preferring the excess precision that comes with Create-Your-Own-Name, is what I was calling &quot;pretentious jargon&quot; in a previous post in the thread.

On the subject of long vs. short term thinking, or the time-value of money, the most clear example is the case of rent-to-own stores.<p>Rent-to-own is a form of financing, equivalent to taking on debt, but unlike other forms of debt, we know that it's used specifically for buying certain classes of durable goods, such as furniture, appliances and televisions.  Due to the nature of these goods, we can assume that in most cases the owning of a given piece of furniture, for example, is not a necessity, and further, that buying these goods new is not the lowest cost alternative, when speaking about the total or even initial price.  For example, I might be able to get a sofa off the street or sleep on a mattress without a frame or box springs.<p>Rent-to-own is also heavily favored by poor folks, who have another opportunity, which is to save up and replace their television or furniture at a later date for a lower total cost.<p>Making the latter choice is the rational one, <i>if</i> your personal discount function for the future value of money is sufficiently low.  That is, if you have a long-term perspective, you value future abundance nearly as much as present abundance, and so save up for an outright purchase.  However, if you have a short-term perspective, the extra you paid for the television would seem insignificant, because it accrued far in the future, and you're more concerned with immediate abundance.",1207558680

156763,comment,156177,156288,0,0,Tichy,,,"What gets me is that few people seem to consider ""find a job with better pay"" as an option. It just doesn't even occur to them. On the contrary, I often hear stories where people might actually pay more for their job than they earn, for example if they drive 50 miles every day to work a minimum wage job (petrol+car maintenance might cost more than what they earn). Either they really don't get the maths straight, or they see it as a temporary thing (need one job to get another), or else I don't know...<p>What about you, what do you study? Are you sure you could not get a better job, for example by building on the things you study? I must admit I was stupid as a student - I studied maths, but instead of taking on some programming job and earning shitloads of money on the side, I just worked standard student jobs with average (low) pay.<p>My point: maybe many people just are not aware of the options. I suppose it is infeasible to assign personal life managers to every poor person, but perhaps information technology could be some help? For example better job boards.",1207557597

E(money) < 0, but E(utility) > 0? As the other reply sad, people get a rush out of gambling, among other things.",1207557013

We could distribute small digitally identifiable satellite dishes to less free countries.  By default they would be disabled. But if a government ever decided to black out communications for a crackdown we could enable all of our dishes in that country.  It wouldn't be perfect but if you made the dish small and cheap enough you could get a bunch of them to the right people via intel channels.

I used to think this was because my taste had changed, but now I think the speed itself is the problem. When I read novels in foreign languages, I enjoy them much more.<p>My advice, start reading slower (and closer) and save time by stop reading fluff. Anything worth reading is worth rereading.",1207555652

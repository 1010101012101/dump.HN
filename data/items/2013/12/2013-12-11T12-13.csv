Sensible defaults are hard to achieve :) Measure user activity and see how people *actually* use the product, and extract your default behaviour from that.\n\n  1b. There is already a &quot;load&quot; link at the menu, that&#x27;s enough for users to load config later.\n</code></pre>\n2. Have you ever used Trello? They serve a similar purpose, and have a nice solution to this: the bottom of a column (&quot;list&quot;, in their parlance) is clickable, to create a new card.<p>3.

There is no #4 :)<p>5. You could also check into external services that provide a save api, such as Google Drive or Dropbox. Localstorage would be cool, but my usage pattern includes accessing from different devices, and having the data saves somewhere externally accessible is crucial.<p>6. Undo. Have undo. You can completely forget about confirmation if you have undo. It&#x27;s not trivial to implement, but man.

I just gave it a go and it seems you can rearrange downwards but not upwards and also not as you would wish. So if you drag something down in the same column it will go to the end of that column. This definitely isn&#x27;t ideal. I had initially started implementing using my own draggable implementation but then reverted to using html5 draggable with contenteditable. I ran into some styling issues when dragging items whilst trying to remain responsive. Basically the items were styled at 90% of the column width but when you dragged them out they grew to 90% of the page and then shrunk back again when they were dropped but I was unable to hack the drag move in a way to maintain size without there being some jump in width which I didn&#x27;t think looked pleasant.<p>This could certainly go down as an issue if you would like to add it or I can add it to the repo.<p>I&#x27;ll try to keep it up and thanks again very much for the feedback, it&#x27;s really appreciated!",1386764874

Most of our team is distributed and outside of expensive outlier markets (like Silicon Valley or NYC).</i><p>> <i>The only way to get a salary increase is by performing consistently well in reviews. We don’t have a profit-sharing plan or bonuses (other than the sales team which has a traditional sales team bonus structure).</i><p>To me this is a way to pay people as little as possible. The &quot;industry-standard salary&quot; for a position like developer increases year over year by more than the rate of inflation. But without even standard cost-of-living increases, it sounds like working at Treehouse for any measurable about of time will put you in a worse financial position than if you bounced around.<p>EDIT: It seems they do offer cost-of-living adjustments but only for employees who are performing well (not that I&#x27;m advocating giving raises to poorly performing employees, but we&#x27;re talking about 1-2% to cover inflation here).",1386764175

The US dollar not being the world currency wouldn&#x27;t drop the value of US industrial output, but it would (presuming that it dropped the value of the dollar due to reduced global demand for US dollars) reduce the value of US debt.<p>90% of all USD in circulation isn&#x27;t even in the US borders. Isn&#x27;t used for the needs of the US industry/economy. Thanks to this the FED can print, print, print into the oblivion, getting back just 10% of inflation it created, while the world gets the 90%. Ever heard the famous: “The dollar is our currency, but your problem” by John Connally, President Nixon’s Treasury Secretary, to a delegation of Europeans worried about exchange rate fluctuations?<p>Now the ponzie scheme grew (as they always have to) so it is not only Europeans, but also Arabs and Asians, but the days of the USD debt ponzie scheme are counted. There are just these many losers on the planet to buy into it.<p>Now, just imagine these additional USD coming from all over the world to the US. Hyperinflation?<p>And just a single simple event could cause that: Chinese tying their Yuan to gold. Who on Earth will want your t-bill backed by the most indebted government on the planet, when they can get it backed by gold and the biggest creditor government in the world?<p>>Which would be bad for entities with incomes or assets denominated in US dollars, but good for entities with debts denominated in US dollars, and neutral for entities whose income was dependent, say, on US output.<p>Right. Your debt would vanish. I think that&#x27;s the only good thing from the hyper inflationary perspective. The debt is USD denominated, so yes, it makes sense. Again, from China perspective, a little price to pay to have world reserve currency instead of the US having it.<p>>This is neither true nor meaningful; as long as the debt can be serviced, it doesn&#x27;t actually need to be repaid (and could, in fact, grow in absolute terms over time without limit without harm so long as output was growing apace.)<p>If we use the official government formula of calculating inflation from Ronald Reagan years we are at 10% today. We&#x27;ve been for at least 3 years now. And what is the return on the t-bill? Again, it might be true, that at least you know you&#x27;ll be repaid even if it means you&#x27;ll loose. But t-bills are in fact in a bubble territory now. What will you do when interest rates rise? If interest rates are at 7% we&#x27;re talking about more than 50% of tax revenue going just to service the debt. Just to pay the premium. Over 50% of the tax revenue! And what if we have to have it at the levels from the beginning of 1980s? At 18% ? We won&#x27;t even be able to service it. And in 1980s most of the debt was hold by the Americans. So the money was going back to the US economy. Currently most of the debt is held by foreigners. Can you imagine the impossibility of a political situation were over 50% of the tax revenue goes to foreigners in the middle of a financial crisis? And it is just at 7% interest rates.

Also, having views handled like vim&#x27;s buffers+tabs+windows instead of fixed situations.<p>To sum it up, vim is not just a bunch of hjkl keybindings. If this tool enables such a grammar and vocabulary in command mode, along with top to bottom scriptability of the editor&#x27;s behavior, then it&#x27;s worthy of the vim moniker.

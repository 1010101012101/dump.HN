3130416,comment,3130097,3130222,4,0,TomOfTTB,,,"When he says ""we graduated during a recession"" I think he means the early 80s recession (Gen X includes those born from around 61-81 so the first batch graduated in the early 80s).  That recession actually was comparable.  In fact peak unemployment was worse (10.8% vs 10.1%).  Many split the early 80s recession into 2 recessions(Early 80 and then mid 81 to late 82) but if you look at that period as a whole the GDP drop exceeds the 2008 recession as well.<p>That being said we aren't done yet either.  Just as there was a temporary recovery between mid-1980 and mid-1981 we've   technically been out of recession for 16 months and things aren't look great for the future.",1319036354
3130415,comment,3130097,3130337,3,0,jeffool,,,"haha, I envy you. My biggest passion is video games, yet every time a new game comes out I'm hesitant to play it, because I know I'll be disappointed. Sometimes I'm surprised when I pick up the right indie game, and there are a few designers whose work I typically like... But that's pretty much it. And it's the same with music, film, books, and anything else. I have this eternal boding sense of ""it's just not going to be as good as it should be.""<p>Of course, there are some things that hit me in the right spot. I still remember when I first learned to play Dwarf Fortress, when I read Chinese Takeout over a weekend. They're just rare.<p>At the same time, I sometimes think this discontent comes not from any kind of true hatred, but instead a longing for the ideal, or at least serious advancement toward it. It seems like our society is horribly slow to advance, and often that feels due to the size and control of older generations. (And my contemporaries who've bought into things as they are.)",1319036345

3130397,comment,3130097,3130097,14,0,michaelochurch,,,"""Generation X"" was originally coined to describe people now considered Late Boomers, from 1953 to 1963. They're in their 50s now. Personally, I'd place ""X"" at 1957-1982 with fuzzy edges. (Steve Jobs was half Boomer, half X; I am half X, half Millennial.) If you could be high and unwashed at Woodstock in 1969 and be in upper management at a major company in 1973, you're a Boomer. If you had to work your ass of from age 15 to get anywhere, you're X or later.<p>I would argue that ""X"" hasn't ended. I was born in 1983 and I don't feel much of a generational separation between myself (1983) and people 10 years older. But I think there's a <i>huge</i> separation between people born in 1945 vs. '55, and also '55 vs. '65. This came into the clear at my wedding, when I could sense ""generational sameness"" in conversations among people of radically different ages (from 3 to 84). I feel like I'm ""the same age"" as people who are 23 (18's different, but that's because of inexperience) or 38, but age 55 and 65 are (generationally speaking) very different, even now.<p>My favorite shows are <i>Mad Men</i> and <i>Breaking Bad</i>. It's best to watch them both. They're eros and thanatos, the bookends of the American Era.<p>I think the ""X"" distinction is about coming of age in what I call Tidal Crisis, which started around 1970 and never ended. Things aren't getting worse-- on average, taking a global perspective, even the 2000s was a great decade-- but progress is uneven and separations are becoming vast. It's a national morale crisis that threatens (IMO) the existence of the U.S. as a cohesive entity. We have pockets of underemployment and clusters of overemployment, and I don't need to say anything about the rich-poor gap that's now tearing the country apart. That's the backdrop for X. But there's also an internal component, which is about having the courage and passion to do the right thing anyway, in spite of a damaged environment. This is why Gen X produced great artists and also (I think) why so many of them are great parents.",1319036128

3130389,comment,3130007,3130007,34,0,edw519,,,"Thanks for posting this. It takes a lot of balls (even with a throwaway account) to post something like this and, hopefully, only good will come out of it. If this thread goes like these kinds of threads usually go on Hacker News, I have no doubt you will have helped quite a few others with this. And hopefully, you will get help too. But that won't be easy. Here's why...<p>When I read your headline on the front page, the first thing I thought was, ""OK, someone to help and encourage. Good."" After I read your comment, I didn't feel quite the same way.<p>I normally try to be upbeat and positive, but in your case, it won't sound that way. I'm going to give it to you straight and I hope that you don't get offended or upset. You need feedback from my point of view.<p>It's perfectly normal for someone to be weak technically or with other people. It's perfectly normal for someone to struggle with work habits, project management, or personal issues. It's also perfectly normal for excellent people to have been fired. Many of us have been on both sides of these issues.<p>And these are the kinds of things that are easily managed and fixed.<p>Your issues, unfortunately, run deeper. Conflicts with bosses? OK, we've all been there. Not getting along? That happens, too. A negative assessment of your boss? Whoa. That would piss me off, too. Why didn't you just talk to him? Refusing to work on a project? WTF? That's your fucking job!<p>These are the kinds of things that are <i>not</i> easily managed and fixed. I don't know why anyone would take a chance on someone with this kind of track performance. I know that I wouldn't. I'd much rather hire a weak performer with good attitude and potential than a strong performer with interpersonal issues you describe. It's just not worth the trouble.<p>You most telling remark, however, was:<p><i>Another obstacle is that I'm an introvert loner and hence just the opposite of the ""communicative teamplayer"" companies seem to be looking for.</i><p>As one introvert loner to another, I can confidently tell you that this is just an excuse. Almost all of us are introvert loners and almost all employers want ""communicative teamplayers"". And most of us just find a way to make it work.<p>I bet I've been in situations like yours (and worse) far more times than you and I bet many others here have too. I've been abused more ways than I care to remember. I've done the work of 5 people and been passed up for promotion. I've worked overtime for years and got no credit. I've been yelled at, cussed at, and many times, generally treated like shit. But I've learned how to put up with it until it's no longer time to put up with it. It all depends where you draw the line.<p>I've never had words with a boss or customer. I've never emailed, talked about someone else, or filled out any form about them without <i>talking to them first</i>. And most of all, I've <i>never refused work</i>. That's our reason for being there in the first place.<p><i>Any ideas on how to get back into the working world with such a track record?</i><p>I may sound negative, but believe me, I really want to help. So here are a few thoughts:<p>1. The root cause of your negative experiences is probably still there. You need to identify that cause, understand your role, and fix it. Get help with that if you think you need it. The good news: you know there's a problem and you're already talking about it. You may be 90% of the way there.<p>2. Always tell the truth.<p>3. Don't be afraid to admit that you may have been wrong.<p>4. Be prepared to describe your experiences (truthfully always!) and what steps you have already taken to grow because of them.<p>5. Don't volunteer (in writing or in person) anything that you don't have to that can potentially hurt you.<p>6. <i>Never</i> give references until <i>after</i> you have a job offer (contingent upon those references).<p>7. Find a way to have a positive attitude and make it show.<p>8. Understand that there are assholes everywhere and you will surely encounter many more. You can't control them. But you must control yourself. Don't let them fuck you up any more.<p>I hope I haven't been too tough, but I think you needed to hear this. I wish you the best and look forward to hearing about you getting up on your feet again. If you want to refute anything I have said or need any follow-up feedback, please contact me off-line. Best wishes!",1319036016
3130388,comment,3130332,3130332,3,0,egiva,,,"Step number one - don't go to court after speaking with just one lawyer or firm. Seek multiple legal opinions before filing. I can't stress enough the importance of this. Also, ask specific questions about how things might go wrong - including whether or not the other company can require you to pay their court fees if you lose.<p>Secondly - think about the size of this company and what might happen if you win, but they appeal the case. Be very wary, because some companies will have a large financial incentive to fight you through various cases and appeals. The reason for this is that allowing you to win your case sets a precedent that affects their other business dealings with other partners.<p>Finally, ask them what happens if the other party counter-sues you, who pays those fees for your defence, etc.<p>PS - I'm not a lawyer, so this is not legal advice. Just devote the majority of your time considering what might go wrong, and ask hard questions of your lawyer before you go to court. Winning in court, unfortunately, isn't always about who has the best legal argument, but rather who has the best defense in terms of legal resources, money, etc. Make sure you have enough resources for the entire process.",1319036015

Now you are being totally silly and showing that you are determined to fight with me for just silly reasons.<p>You are the one being 'personal'.  You just don't want the argument made that sole founders can be a good bet and just want to stay with the PG and VC herd that cofounders are crucial, say, for naming the company and cut me down for not joining your herd.<p>Jobs was a successful sole founder at Next, Pixar, and his return to Apple.  The only role from Woz and Jobs's first time at Apple was just cash, not Woz or a 'cofounder'.  You are straining to deny that Jobs was successful in his last three gigs as a sole founder.<p>Gates?  He had to refound the company after the success of MS/DOS and make Windows, Windows Server, SQL Server, and Office all real.  He did.  Alone.  While doing this, IBM was laughing at him.  He knocked the socks off IBM, DB2, Lotus, WordPerfect, Sun, HP, and more.<p>Just look around you:  Commonly cofounders and coleaders just suck.  Big committees suck.  Group decision making sucks.  Take IBM, AT&T, GM, Sun, HP:  In each case, the management suite and top management 'team' was awash in what was regarded as the best qualifications.  Still, they all just sucked.  The Navy knows better:  On the bridge of a ship, there exactly one captain.  Although one captain can be bad, two is usually worse.<p>Then you are ignoring the present for what is central at HN:  IT startups, especially Web 2.0 startups.  Elsewhere on this thread I've explained in good detail:  A founder needs to understand his business; he needs to understand the software; the bottleneck in understanding the software is not the unique software of the company but just understanding the now huge software components available; that bottleneck can be passed by just one person at a time, essentially alone, or learning is not a spectator sport or a team sport; once a founder has passed this bottleneck, a cofounder becomes much less relevant than in the past.  You can see this, if you want to.<p>The main issue here is sole founders or cofounders.  The resolution is, net, having all the business between one pair of ears is a great advantage when it can be done, and now for a Web 2.0 startup it not only can be done but should be done.  The 'team' of Michelangelo and anyone else would be nowhere nearly as good at painting the ceiling as just Michelangelo alone.",1319035727

That's not unusual; most smart people in their 20s <i>do</i> have serious issues to work through. I don't know you, so I can't comment on that. You probably have a better sense of what you need to fix about yourself than I do.<p>Three job-ending personality conflicts in less than 3 years is worse than average, but not the worst I've seen. But do take the hint that you might be doing a few things wrong. You don't need to be a popular-jock type, but please do yourself a favor and bring your social skills at least up to the 35th percentile. Read books like <i>How to Win Friends and Influence People</i> and read them seriously. (Just don't get into that sleazy PUA shit.)<p>Personal change is the hard part. Regarding career repair, that's much easier. Find a good recruiter and she'll help you with a lot of that. First, don't put months on your CV, just years. If you worked at a place from Nov. 2008 to Jan. 2009, put 2008-2009. If your tenure was 6/2010 to 8/2010, just put 2010 unless it was an internship (then put a season, e.g. ""summer 2010""). Second, never say you were fired. Say you left of your own volition; no one can legally contradict you. If previous employers say something different, have your attorney send a C&D letter. Make sure your departure reflects positively on your ambition but not negatively on the company. Third, check your references. Use a professional reference-checking service like Allison and Taylor instead of trying to do it yourself. Find out what people are saying. If the references are damaging, bring on the C&D's. Fourth, most people with ""damaged track records"" are people who give away the store on their ex-employers. The ""permanent record"" exists, but only in your mind. If you can just learn to shut the fuck up occasionally (I'm speaking from personal experience and past mistakes, so I know how hard this can be) about the injustices you've faced it will do you favors. You can do much more damage to your enemies (if that's what you want; most people stop caring about their enemies once they're successful) by succeeding and getting into an important role later in life than you can by smearing their reputations in 20 unsuccessful (you can't throw shit without some sticking to you) interviews.<p>When you interview, keep the conversation technical and focus on <i>what you worked on</i>. The politics and personality conflicts you should gloss over entirely. And learn a few stock evasive answers if you get questions related to these matters. When interviewers probe you for political dirty laundry on past employers, they're not doing it because they ""value"" your opinion; it's either (a) a test, or (b) scouting against competitors, and neither benefits you personally.",1319034937

Perhaps part of your frustration is trying to fit yourself, a square peg, into the round hole of a corporate team environment.<p>I'm assuming you're looking for CS gigs, and that you have entrepreneurial aspirations. Maybe you should hit some freelance websites to fill your coffers & stay afloat, while working on an idea of your own on the side.

For example, the ""dock"" in the original iPhone looked like a speaker grill - it was probably a useful convention to denote to people that had never used OSX that it was a special section at the bottom of the phone/screen.  Now it's a glassy reflective surface that subtly denotes the dock area and nicely borders the screen (much more subtly than the ICS dock, IMO).  The scrollbars in OSX were once colorful and rounded, but steadily and gradually became flatter, grayer, and then basically invisible.  I wouldn't be surprised if the now prevalent ""fabric"" pattern sees a similar fate.<p>Apple tends to make the metaphors glaringly obvious and keep them around in a certain class of very simple apps (the compass and calculator fall under this).  It's funny that Duarte mentioned wood because Apple nerds have been arguing about the wood trim in Garageband (a spinoff from the sleek, German designed Logic app) since it launched.  For power users, these things are a stupid distraction, but for the %90 of the population that is boggled by the idea of using a completely new class of software, they denote that this is fun, easy-to-use software.  Google, who've made plenty of great products that have gone relatively unused, could probably learn a few things here.<p>There's a certain logic to the anti-skeutomorph thing, but it gets weird when it leads to dismissing Apple offhandedly.  Mastery of these metaphors is a good part of the reason Apple are where they are today.  It's amazing how consistent these textures, gestures and animations are across three platforms (and how smoothly they reached this point) while the other platforms are having identity crises.<p>I should add that I'm enormously tempted to get the Galaxy Nexus, so please take this as pro-Apple, not anti-Google.",1319033897

You are correct that Gates, Jobs, and Buffett are not perfect examples of successful sole founders, but the question is, can a sole founder be successful?  The 'rub' in this question is, can just one guy, alone, making all the decisions alone, do well?  Then the examples of Gates, Jobs, and Buffett are quite relevant because each did great things essentially alone.<p>For Jobs, whatever might say about Woz and Jobs's first period at Apple, later Jobs did very well alone at Next, Pixar, and back at Apple.  For those last three gigs, Woz was somewhere in the nickel seats.  Yes, the success with Woz gave Jobs a lot of cash that was no doubt important for him in his last three gigs.  So, then we say that Jobs is an example of a three time successful sole founder with cash.  So, with cash a sole founder can work.<p>After the success of MS/DOS and Allen leaving Microsoft, Gates really had to reinvent, 'refound' the company.  It is fair to say that he was a founder again.  Yes, he was a founder with cash, but he was still acting essentially alone.  Again, the issue is, can a sole founder do it alone, and that is what we are addressing.  With the cash from MS/DOS, Gates did it alone.  It's amazing what he did because he crushed IBM, Sun, Lotus, Netscape, DB2, and more.<p>For Buffett, no way should we count Ben Graham!  He wrote a book and was a prof of Buffett at Columbia and possibly a friend.  Graham had likely hundreds of students and millions of readers, but there was just one Berkshire.  So, for Berkshire I don't credit Graham.<p>For Munger's role, that's just a judgment call, but my reading is that Buffett didn't much need him.  Partly I draw that conclusion because it appears in recent years Buffett has been making his decisions essentially just alone.<p>Again, the main issue is, can a sole founder really get the work done or will he go off the deep end, for fast women, slow horses, cheap booze, wacko ideas, etc.?  Well, Gates, Jobs, and Buffett didn't do any of these bad things.<p>There's another great example:  Fred Smith at FedEx.

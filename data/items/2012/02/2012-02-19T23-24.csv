3610770,comment,3609067,3609931,1,0,sedev,,,"""For instance, the Nationalist Socialist Workers Party, also known as the Nazis, were a pro-union, pro-socialism, pro-farmer, party. It seems that the accusation of ""right wing"" comes from using the term as a synonym for ""authoritarian"".""<p>No! No, you are factually wrong, and wrong in a way I think it's important to correct. I recommend reading David Neiwert's work - Mr. Neiwert is a journalist whose main beat is fascist movements. The inclusion of ""socialist"" in the name ""National Socialist Workers' Party"" is the most blatant kind of red herring. The Nazis were as anti-socialist and anti-union as you could get! Within three months of taking power, for example, Hitler banned trade unions entirely and imprisoned their leaders. There are gobs of instances in Hitler and Goebbels' own writing where they curse those evil evil unions, those evil evil socialists. Mussolini's Blackshirt squads, meanwhile, had nearly a full-time job assaulting and agitating against socialist activists, and Mussolini himself described fascism as ""estato corporativo"" - the corporate state.<p>Here's a good start on Neiwert's work:<p>* <a href=""http://dneiwert.blogspot.com/2008/01/responding-to-jonah.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dneiwert.blogspot.com/2008/01/responding-to-jonah.htm...</a><p>* <a href=""http://dneiwert.blogspot.com/2009/06/fascism-is-not-liberal-profound.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dneiwert.blogspot.com/2009/06/fascism-is-not-liberal-...</a><p>The rest of your argument is to be addressed on its own terms, but on the point I quoted, you are wrong, wrong, wrong, on the facts and it's important that on that particular point, the actual history of fascism be faced. The fascist regimes of Germany and Italy in the 20th century were no way, no how pro-union or pro-socialist: they were avowedly and forcefully the opposite.<p>(also: 'when fascism comes to America, it will be wrapped in the American flag and waving a cross' cf <a href=""http://is.gd/it4zJ6"" rel=""nofollow"">http://is.gd/it4zJ6</a> )",1329695430

3610760,comment,3598915,3599511,1,0,drifkin,,,"JS static analysis tools can help you find mistakes that are often more serious than a missing semicolon.<p>I've run into something like this before:<p><pre><code>  for (var i = 0, len = items.length; i < len; i++)
  {
    var item = items[i];
    // ...maybe some more code here...
    var subItems = item.subItems;
    for (var i = 0, len = subItems.length; i < len; i++) {
      // whoops
    }
  }
</code></pre>
The inner for loop's i & len variables are really the same as the outer for loop's i & len variables (there's no shadowing going on here because they're all in the same scope in JS). Depending on the order of things and how many subItems there are, you could end up with an infinite loop, iterating over the same items multiple times, or skipping certain items. It seems like it'd be an obvious problem to see, but if there's a significant amount of code above the inner for loop, you might miss it. It also seems like it'd result in very obvious bugs, but if subItems are rare, most of the time this code will run just fine.<p>Most of the JS static analysis tools will complain about redeclaring i and len, which makes spotting this kind of problem much easier.",1329694991

Though the word ""soul"" is mostly used in conjunction with dualistic assumptions, it has a deeper meaning that is fairly independent of dualism:  Your soul is whatever makes you who you are.  Your soul is what really matters about you.  Whether the soul is separate from the body and survives it is another question.<p>I also have a specific reason to use that word: its emotional impact.  For instance, one reason I think we should stop death is because it means the destruction of the soul.

In both those cases, the patient never regained consciousness, and passed away in the ICU a few days later. This story repeats itself over and over again... I don't know what the actual percentage is, but the number of elderly patients who are 'resuscitated' only to never wake up again is surely north of 99%.<p>I'm conflicted about my participation in this process... CPR is a very brutal process, and all the interventions we use to restart someone's heart are equally traumatic.<p>So, why do we do this? In most cases, it's because someone doesn't have a DNR, or any other sort of advanced directive. In most (all?) states, if you call EMS and don't have a DNR, you need to actually threaten us to absolve us of our legal duty to start resuscitative efforts (in reality, most of us are human beings, and simply explaining the situation should be enough). The other situation is when a patient _does_ have a DNR, but the family is insistent that we ""Do something!""<p>In both of my recent experiences, our efforts kept the patient 'alive' long enough for out of town family to travel back to say their goodbyes.<p>Was it worth it though?

It's a drug you can take to come to terms with dying and leaving your partner and kids while having a long, open talk with them.    It's a chemical that breaks down your inhibitions and leaves you able to study what emotionally ails you without the anxiety that usually coattails along.<p>MDMA is a medicine and we need to start seeing it as that.

9445427,comment,9445036,9445036,0,0,jasim,,,"This is a bold take on a problem that a lot of people have written away as reinventing the wheel. But color me impressed!<p>Unlike almost every other Javascript framework we&#x27;ve so far seen, FOAM makes the data model the primary entity in the system, which is a good idea. In the typical UI-driven development of web applications, the data model often gets modified without much thought and causes cascading complexity across the rest of the system. A lot of the convoluted UI code that I&#x27;ve written could&#x27;ve been kept simple by keeping the data model sane by finding and utilizing equivalences, making implied meaning explicit by extracting names, and normalizing/denormalizing the data appropriately. A data-structure driven development approach should help a lot here.<p>FOAM also implements another item from my wishlist: being able to see all the UI representation of any given piece of data in one place. It achieves this by keeping all possible templates for a piece of data directly in its object. (<a href=""http://foam-framework.github.io/foam/tutorial/4-templates/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://foam-framework.github.io/foam/tutorial/4-templates/</a>)<p>In general, this looks like the most declarative (as in,  define your business requirements instead of writing imperative code) way of building web applications that I&#x27;ve seen yet. I would like to see what new ideas this library can bring into the &#x27;Perfect UI Framework&#x27; conversation, but past experience makes me skeptical of any implementation that overly relies on metaprogramming. Metaprogramming can take us maybe 50% of the way home, but programming unfortunately is often an art in the minutiae. UI code is especially prone to this problem: things that have to deal with humans cannot be absolutely symmetrical all the time, which is where any overly declarative approach to building software breaks down. I often look back to this quote by DHH as a reminder of the dangers in generalization:<p><pre><code>    On the surface, the dream of components sounds great 
    and cursory overviews of new projects also appear to be 
    &quot;a perfect fit&quot;. But they never are. Reuse is hard. 
    Parameterized reuse is even harder. And in the end, 
    you&#x27;re left with all the complexity of a swiss army 
    knife that does everything for no one at great cost 
    and pain.
    - DHH ca. 2005
</code></pre>
Also, template based UI frameworks are IMO a relic of the past, of which I&#x27;m convinced by the way templates are defined imperatively using code in React. In templating, the UI is a String, but UI should be Code because code is awesome.",1430132166

But because punishments were draconian, they were often commuted -- by the end of the 18th century about half of death sentences ended up being turned into transportation and involuntary servitude (basically, exile and slavery). Crime rates remained terrifyingly high by modern standards until the 1830s, when Sir Robert Peel as Home Secretary abolished and rationalized a lot of laws (he axed the death penalty for most offenses but replaced it with imprisonment) and instituted the first modern police forces:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Peel"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Peel</a><p>Anyway, the takeaway from all this is, the British state in the 18th century performed a large-scale experiment that proved pretty much definitively that draconian punishments <i>do not deter crime</i>. What reduces criminal activity is <i>certainty of apprehension</i>, even if the punishment is relatively mild or rehabilitative.

Whenever you have multiple things happening at once, you have concurrency and programming concurrent system is <i>always really hard</i>.<p>Unfortunately the software industry has never really got a grip on this problem and there are lots of developers who have never really studied multi-threading at all. That&#x27;s a problem, because it&#x27;s something that takes a lot of practice and you have to just incorporate it into the way you think. After a while you do get a sixth sense for race conditions, but you&#x27;ll still write racy code from time to time anyway. It&#x27;s just tricky to get it right 100% of the time.<p>spdy has already outlined what is happening here, but this problem is something that is covered in literally any introductory course to database systems or multi-threaded programming. If you have two threads (or processes) in flight simultaneously that are reading and writing to a shared data store, then you need some kind of mutual exclusion. That can mean a lock:<p>1. Request for /reviews/add is received.<p>2. Database lock on the page reviews table is acquired.<p>3. Check if the user has already posted a review. If so, release the lock and abort (any good framework will release locks for you automatically if you throw an exception).<p>4. Add review to table.<p>5. Release lock.<p>At the point where the lock is acquired if another web server is in the middle of the operation, conceptually speaking the first one will stop and wait for the table to become available.<p>Real implementations don&#x27;t actually &quot;stop and wait&quot; - that would be too slow. They use database transactions instead where both web server processes/threads proceed optimistically, and at the end the database will undo one of the changes if they detect that there was a conflict .... but you can imagine it as being like stop and wait.<p>Of course once you have concurrency, you have all the joy that comes with it like various kinds of deadlock.<p>It&#x27;s funny, a few days ago I was letting my mind wonder and ended up thinking about web apps for some reason. Oh yes, now I remember, I was thinking about concurrency strategies in a software library I maintain and how to explain it to people. And then I was thinking how hard multi-threading is and how many people are selling snake-oil silver bullets to it, and started to wonder how many web apps had race conditions in them. And then I just discarded the thought as one of no consequence and got on with my day, haha :) Perhaps I should have tried to earn a bit of money this way instead.",1430130220

On tech topics no less.<p>With this being printed media, &quot;long-form&quot; was more or less the norm for the more in-depth article, and space requirements were <i>very</i> strenuous: you had <i>exactly</i> this much space to fill, no more, no less [1].<p>But we were <i>explicitly</i> encouraged to choose topics for which &quot;this much space&quot; was meaningful (for those of my colleagues who didn&#x27;t get to choose their topics, like the hardware folks who had to write about whatever was happening, the choice of topic and assigned space went hand in hand). Sometimes, I&#x27;d choose to cover two or three things in the space that was given to me in order to avoid writing pretentious equivalents to Lorem ipsum so as to fill in the page.<p>I fondly remember the stern, to-the-point feedback that we&#x27;d get from our senior editor. A draft of this article would have probably received a feedback like &quot;twice longer than it needs to be. Make it shorter, send me pics.&quot;<p>The gist was that there was no such thing as &quot;long-&quot; or &quot;shortform&quot;. What you wanted was exactly-as-long-as-it-needs-to-be-form. Some points require many words to convey. Some don&#x27;t. It&#x27;s being selective in your verbalization that draws the line between eloquence and hypergraphia. The entire &quot;I am an optimist&quot; section is an unfortunate example of that.<p>1. Most of us weren&#x27;t exactly experienced journalists though, so filling &quot;this much space&quot; was often achieved with a lot of help from the heroic DTP team, which basically survived on coffee during the last week of an edition.",1430129658

I think often when people are explaining to others some of those people phrase things in a way that is meant to impress others (and somewhat often, impress themselves as well).<p>My opinions on the &quot;stepping outside comfort zone&quot; discussions are based on my interaction with people.  I could, of course, be making incorrect judgements.<p>Anyway the following is mainly just for me - putting my thoughts into writing lets me think about it a bit more.  I am not sure if it helps anyone else.  But...<p>I would not assume people are stating it that way to be cool.  I would, based on their other statements, how they behave, the choices they make, the way they treat others... make judgements about the particular individual in question.  Those I only know a little bit, I would be more likely to be wrong.  I try to make judgement with an understanding of how much uncertainty there is in that judgement.<p>There really isn&#x27;t much reason for anyone to place much weight in my thoughts.  But I just express what I have seen.  And I have seen lots of people talking about &quot;stepping outside your comfort zone&quot; that are misstating what it seems to me is really going on (both from location independent folks and others).  This mainly matters when they convince other people what they should be doing.<p>I think the advice would be better if people said I found out that I didn&#x27;t like the common expectations and decided to take matters into my own hands to do what I felt would be better for me.  And that was a bit scary for me (for most people it is) but I am happy now (or not - I tried something and it didn&#x27;t work, which is fine, if you don&#x27;t have this happen you probably are missing out on lots of potentially cool stuff for you).  That way people don&#x27;t go focus on &quot;getting out of their comfort zone&quot; they focus on what would make them happy and then take a look at how to get there even if it means being a bit unconventional.<p>Then they have to evaluate how willing they are to take risks, or try this new thing in order to achieve that new state.  But the focus isn&#x27;t on being uncomfortable but on getting something they want and whether they are willing to do some things that might be uncomfortable for them to get there.<p>There are times when just doing something crazy that you are scared to do may make sense.  But I think that is fairly rare.  Being willing to try something that you are not sure you will like in order to see, makes perfect sense.  Accepting that you are willing to risk potential discomfort makes sense.<p>And there are times to try things you didn&#x27;t like much (in the past) or you are a bit uncomfortable with because this gives you new data.  People are complex.  We change over time.  What you hated once, you may not hate later.  I hated public speaking as a little kid.  I figured I could have a job that didn&#x27;t involve that or working in loud factories (we visited some as a kid and it didn&#x27;t seem fun to me).<p>As I grew up one way to make money that on balance appealed to me was giving seminars.  Over the years I got past hating public speaking but it still wasn&#x27;t something I felt at ease with.  It did make me uncomfortable.  I have done it and am happy.  And it still is somewhat uncomfortable.  But overall it makes my life better.  So avoiding anything not in your comfort zone I think is most often a mistake.  But I think it is not so much about doing things outside your comfort zone being innately good (which is how many people talk when they are telling people about their adventures and explaining their path to success...).<p>I think instead it is about seeking your deep happiness.  And not falling into habits that leave you plodding along day to day in a way that isn&#x27;t how you really want to leave but is easy.  And not being limited because you fear any significant step outside your comfort zone.  But also mainly it is about getting to places that are in your comfort zone and lead to a life of long term happiness.  For many people that is a job in a office that is secure with a spouse and kids and living something close to the 1950s ideal (update in various ways).  And for some people it is being a nomad, for others being a farmer for 10 years then a artist, then a computer programmer then, for others being a doctor and spending 3 weeks a year in very poor countries with Doctors without Borders, etc..  For some it is even being a lawyer (even if, in my experience these have a high rate of not being happy in the long term, that isn&#x27;t universal - some are very happy with that for their entire life).<p>Each choice has benefits and consequences.  I think many people would have happier and more fulfilling lives if they challenged the conventional wisdom (of their situation) much more.  I think the main things that are required is examining yourself, think sensibly about the long term, be willing to accept the consequences or your decisions and evaluating how that is working for you.<p>It isn&#x27;t so much an overall conventional wisdom that traps people, in my opinion but a more specific conventional wisdom for those you associate with.  Like most things, this isn&#x27;t universal, but it is very common it seems to me.  Those you associate with and those you watch, read and listen to will shape what you think is acceptable and what options are sane and what are crazy.  Often those limitations are the biggest barrier to you making as much of your life as you can.  Occasionally you are blessed to have that pull you forward into being the most you can be.  If so, appreciate how lucky you were.  I think I was pretty lucky.",1430129352

There's not much resistance to understanding the meaning there. The Pac-Man game logo was a bit more complete, but Pac-Man is universally recognized. This on the other hand - how may people will see the logo when they move their cursor away and understand that something on the page isn't broken - that it's intentional?<p>It will be interesting to see the larger reaction from everyday Google users.",1283846334

It's completely orthogonal to how I function that I often spend a major part of the day just recovering from it.<p>I arrive in the office ready to roll, motivated, head full of ideas that have matured during the night, breakfast and commute. I can litterally arrive, sit down and crank out code (or whatever task is on). And then it's daily morning scrum meeting, and even that 5 or 10 minutes (when done right, a thing I've never seen with my own eyes) totally kills this mental state. 99% of the time my task is self-sufficient enough that what other team members do is completely irrelevant to me and I rarely have any insight to give them either. And I don't remember nor even care what I did yesterday, it's done, forgotten, check the SVN commit logs if you want to know about it. So I zone out, then the meeting is over and I've half-forgotten what I was doing so it's time to look at the latest meme on reddit.<p>I'd gladly settle for a daily _evening_ scrum meeting:
    - What did you do today?
    - What bothered you?
    - What will you do tomorrow?
put that in the back of my mind and go home, I'm sure I'll have sorted things during the night to be useful tomorrow.",1283845526

I see as a politically expedient way to bring local job growth. The city of Portland has spent a lot of time and money, plus a few million kicked in by the state of Oregon, to lure Danish wind-turbine maker Vestas into building their North American headquarters there. As a taxpayer, I'm never sure if we get a good long term ROI on such deals. I think I'd feel better about it if they put that much money into bolstering the state's middling engineering and science university program education or fostering tech incubators.<p><i>""Corvallis was once a hotbed for tech start-ups""</i><p>Is that true or is it newspaper hyperbole?

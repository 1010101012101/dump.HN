By my understanding, a deck full of face cards benefits the gambler in blackjack. If a dealer notices that his cards are missing say, the jack of diamonds, it would be wrong of him to keep dealing knowing that the house had a better advantage that intended. Surely players losing money in such a situation would want their money back.<p>Again, the analogy isn't perfect, but I can see the casino's point of view... even if the decision to sue customers is short-sighted.",1346781513

He died in 1883, but his legacy is just as important now as it was then.  He believed that education is a public good - that it should be available to anyone, regardless of their ability to pay, gender, race, religion, social class, or political beliefs.  This may not seem like a huge thing now, but it was then.<p>The reason I bring it up now is because the institution he founded, The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art, is in trouble.  It has been a full-scholarship college for art, architecture, and engineering students since 1902 but it will run out of money in 2015 unless it gets significant help.<p>I am not soliciting donations (I doubt there are a lot of rogue billionaires on this list anyway. . .) but I would like you to take 10 second to Google""Cooper Union"" and learn about Peter Cooper's dream for education.

It's really, really difficult to make myself go through the pain for indefinite results at an indefinite time in the future, which means I go through cycles of exercising steadily for a few weeks or months (during which I see almost immediate and quite noticeable improvements) and then quitting once the improvements are not so immediate or noticeable.<p>I notice the same pattern in other areas of my life: when I played World of Warcraft, the first 15-20 levels were great fun, and I usually could convince myself to keep going to level 30 or so.  Somewhere between 25 and 35 I'd stop playing.  Later, they made it faster to level, and the sweet spot moved up to 45-60, and then it became faster still, and I managed to get a coupla characters to 80.  I was still treating the actual game as something to get through to enjoy the leveling up experience, though, and if I couldn't expect to level up in <i>this</i> session of play, I would have very little interest in playing right now.<p>In programming, if I'm working on something I don't actively enjoy, I have to structure my work as a series of small victories, or I will put it off until time pressure forces me to grind through it all at once.",1346780993

In all of the cases for these large stores that separation was put in to facilitate putting the meta data into lower latency storage than the 'bulk' data which facilitates fast access.<p>As cperciva relates, tarsnap spends a lot of time de-duplicating data (or writing only one copy of a block with identical contents) which is great for reducing your overall storage footprint which lowers your costs. But if the cost of storage is much much smaller than the retrieval cost, then your design methodology would be different.<p>So I would not be surprised if there was a way to build a function equivalent product to tarsnap that had lower storage costs if the bulk data was in glacier and the index data was in S3, or if the index data was designed such that a document recovery was exactly two retrievals (a catalog, and then the data). And of course such a system would not de-duplicate as that would result in potentially more retrievals.<p>It seems that if the price delta ratio between Glacier and S3 was higher than the de-dupe ratio, then Glacier would 'win' with no de-dupe. Else de-dupe would still win. Thoughts?",1346780557

Different frameworks are clearly better suited for different tasks.<p>But I can't really get behind the author's stance that it is wrong for people to have preferences (even strong ones) about which javascript frameworks they like to use.<p>For one, while every framework likely has different strengths, that isn't the same thing as all frameworks actually being good.  It is very possible that an intelligent person with great intentions could write a framework that simply falls short of other frameworks in so many important regards that you can't really consider it ""good"".  It is also possible that a framework will have such a niche use that most people would not benefit from using it.<p>Additionally, while not every project has the same sorts of requirements that could be satisfied with a single javascript framework, most are.  Most apps that are being built in the startup community these days are basically little more than user interfaces to some REST api.  Some may take it a step further and go ""realtime"" by using web sockets, but the application doesn't differ significantly from a REST based equivalent.  If multiple frameworks set out to solve <i>common</i> problems, then I don't think it is ridiculous at all to compare them and maintain a preference.<p>One way or another, I think we can all agree that the title ""Client-Side Frameworks Suck"" is total link-bait that does not adequately describe the article itself.

Is that a bad thing?<p>I was under the impression that Larry and Sergey did the same thing with Google.

E.g. Shareholders and Wall Street were thrilled when Dell was outsourcing their core competencies to Asus, which in the end screwed them over. Dell is now just a shadow of what it used to be, with no bright future ahead.<p>Of course, if you view that as a warning sign, then simply don't buy. But there are other factors at play here.

That's different that the you're-training-too-hard-and-its-time-to-stop pain.<p>For those looking to make a similar shift, I strongly recommend finding some external structure that tells you how much to train. E.g., Hal Higdon's beginner guide: <a href=""http://halhigdon.com/training/50933/5K-Novice-Training-Program"" rel=""nofollow"">http://halhigdon.com/training/50933/5K-Novice-Training-Progr...</a><p>Then, don't be arrogant about it. Don't say, ""Hey, I want to run a race sooner, so I'll just skip 4 weeks ahead."" If you are going to err, err on the side of gentleness. Start with week 1, and if that seems hard, just do week 1 again until it seems right. You are trying to develop a lifetime habit, so you have a lifetime to get this right.<p>Also, get a heart rate monitor. Set it to beep if you your heart rate gets too high. Ideally, get one that records data, so you can understand your workouts in context. If you are looking mainly forward, it's easy to get impatient. But if you have actual data showing what you ran the last month, it's easier to say, ""Oh, I can see the improvement, so I'll try to do a little better next week.""",1346778567

It was all because of moral relativism. You see, in that sort of a climate, you are not allowed to criticise others-after all, if there is no absolute right and wrong, then what grounds is there for criticism?  Now, this led to a good deal of general frustration, for people are naturally censorious and love nothing better than to criticise others shortcomings. And so it was that they seized on hypocrisy and elevated it from a ubiquitous peccadillo into the monarch of all vices. For, you see, even if there is no right and wrong, you can find grounds to criticise another person by contrasting what he has espoused with what he has actually done. In this case, you are not making any judgment whatsoever as to the correctness of his views or the morality of his behaviour-you are merely pointing out that he has said one thing and done another. Virtually all political discourse in the days of my youth was devoted to the ferreting out of hypocrisy.",1346778414

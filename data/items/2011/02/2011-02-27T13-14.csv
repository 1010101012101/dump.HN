2267828,comment,2265444,2266075,0,0,vog,,,"Although your statement is apparently a joke, there's some unexpected truth in it:<p>You don't even need a hex editor – SVG is an XML format, so a simple text editor will do perfectly fine! This means that in case of some Inkscape issues, you can always fine-tune the vector graphics ""by hand"".<p>This also means that <i>generating</i> vector graphics is as easy as generating HTML code in a web application. You don't need any imaging library for that. (For the old-school hackers: yes, this is also possible with Postscript, i.e. EPS)  Then, you can use Inkscape to preview the picture and to make some final changes by hand, if desired. (Here, things get tricky if you use EPS instead)<p>Also, any modern browser understands SVG, so you don't have to do any image conversion. Heck, you don't even need an <img> tag! Just put the SVG code directly into your (X)HTML document.<p><i>tl;dr: SVG is really cool, and Inkscape uses it natively.</i>",1298815093

2267824,comment,2266867,2267293,0,0,ZoFreX,,,"""Language level"" is not a good metric. This comes up from time to time, with one site or another analysing your ""writing level"", frequently by re-purposing Flesch–Kincaid readability tests[1]. These tests tell you how hard it is to <i>read</i> something, and the assumption then is that my writing is better than yours because mine is ""11th grade"" and yours is ""8th grade"". Of course, having higher entry requirements does not mean my writing is in any way better, and may actually mean the converse - if you had written, for example, an accurate account of quantum physics that was accessible to 8th graders, that would be an impressive writing accomplishment indeed! An example of a site that would be unfairly penalised by measuring language level would be the simple English Wikipedia[2].<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flesch%E2%80%93Kincaid_readability_test"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flesch%E2%80%93Kincaid_readabil...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page"" rel=""nofollow"">http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page</a>",1298814878

2267808,comment,2266134,2266383,0,0,patio11,,,"YC has a number of great hacks:<p>1). ""Proprietary deal flow"" is another way to say ""A given firms choices are to take my offer or forgoe investment."" YC has scads of it, partially because it identifies entrepreneurs at a stage in the lifecycle where angels are not an option or where they might not be recognized as an option (subtle difference there).  This has accelerated with YC's successful track record.<p>2). Mass production techniques in a market where everyone else thinks it is still the Italian Renaissance.<p>3). Super linear returns to just about everything they do, due to being able to take one firm's gains and reapply them to everyone else with the YC brand.  If they coach a firm to get one piece of PR, for most angel's that is a one-off Yay, but YC essentially gets to keep a portion of the win.  Ditto link juice, reputation in the hiring pool, discounts, access to nonpublic offerings, etc etc.<p>4). ""Alma mater"" levels of loyalty among startups, which means that for a fixed time-bounded investment they continue deriving network effects years down the line.  It's comparable to Harvard giving scholarships: you only have to educate a poor kid once but he's crimson for the rest of his life.<p>There's an entire ice-cream sundae of win here, and it's hard to say it's the peanuts or the chocolate that makes it work.

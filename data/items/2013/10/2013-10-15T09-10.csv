If that&#x27;s the case then your focus should be on lowering these costs, or focus on better acquisition (you&#x27;re spending marketing dollars attracting the wrong crowd), and not on shooting yourself in the foot by adding unnecessary friction.<p>Putting a CC up front doesn&#x27;t make your prospects value the service more, it gives them a higher barrier to cross in terms of trust. You need a well-recognized brand to be able to make it work IMO. Some people are just not comfortable giving their credit card if they don&#x27;t know you.<p>Also, check the references I quote in the blog post, according to the studies conducted by Totango, requiring a CC upfront results in lower end-to-end conversion rates.<p>Check also <a href=""http://www.quora.com/Conversion-Optimization/In-what-scenarios-is-it-more-effective-to-require-a-credit-card-up-front-from-users-when-signing-up-for-a-trial-account"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.quora.com/Conversion-Optimization/In-what-scenari...</a> , there are good answers that elaborate on this.",1381831171

6552365,comment,6545132,6546527,2,0,mrow84,,,"Markets &quot;decide&quot; what is best by responding to price signals. If you buy a cheap T-shirt then you are saying to the market that you value low price over an ethical supply chain.<p>Buyers from first world countries do not (in general) deal first-hand with the labourers, they deal with factory owners who have the capital equipment necessary to do the manufacturing at the required scale. All the while that there is price pressure from the market (from you), the buyers will be pushing that price pressure onto the factory owners. As long as there is one factory owner who is willing to take that low price then all factory owners who want the same (or similar) contracts have to take that price, otherwise they are out-competed in the free market. They, in turn, push that price pressure onto their workers, preventing increases in wages.<p>The rest of what you said is correct: the workers take the jobs not because they want to work for such low wages, but because they are the best wages they can obtain given their skill levels. Buying cheap clothes almost directly contributes to the continuation of poverty.<p>As an aside, you mentioned child labour. A not uncommon strand to discussions on these issues is that people should &quot;act more responsibly&quot; and &quot;choose&quot; to get educated when they are young rather than waste their time for the short-term benefits of working. People send their children to work because they can&#x27;t bring in enough money themselves, for reasons like disability (there are a lot more workplace accidents in countries with poor labour protections!) or plain poverty. How does the hypothetical 9 year old improve their lot if the best thing they can do at the age of 9 is get a job manufacturing clothes?",1381831043

But even so, how can you conclude that the article says the opposite based on this one sentence?  Most of the article is about Burberry&#x27;s success in China, and it even mentions sales growth percentage expected.<p>I read the article as saying that China is going well for Burberry and is expected to continue to go well.  Additional growth on top of that will also come from other countries.  This is likely because China&#x27;s been penetrated pretty well by Burberry, whereas those other countries haven&#x27;t yet.<p>Live in China, and my anecdotal experience is that the Burberry advertising and store presence is on par with a lot of luxury brands here.

6552262,comment,6549502,6551474,2,0,drewcrawford,,,"> &quot;Real price&quot; is the cost of a connection that &quot;never&quot; slows down, because it is literally dedicated to you and only you.<p>So I have come to the conclusion that in part we are talking past each other.  You are saying “Consider the set of people such that they need more bandwidth than is available in the pre-existing copper/fiber cabeling to the premises.  In that case they need new cable/fiber.  This is expensive.  The fiber that they will receive is theirs alone (since, for starters, nobody else seems to need it).”  Yes, that is all true.<p>However you are conflating this with the alternative “Anyone who does not do this shares a line with other persons and therefore can have no reasonable expectations about their level of service.”  Which is not true.  It is, in fact, the responsibility of the ISP to make a reasonable effort to control oversubscription.  Some ISPs do not do this, of course, but the consumer is not wrong for having the expectation.<p>Here in Austin, we have 8x4 DOCSIS3 to the building.  That’s about 340MBit/s down.  If you divide that by the ten units in this building, that’s 34Mbit of (dedicated) bandwidth to each unit.  Meanwhile my advertised speed is 35Mbit.  I’m never going to notice if everybody saturates their connections and I lose 3% of my bandwidth.  So.<p>There are higher packages, and so I dunno, maybe there is this class of people that is just super annoyed that they are suddenly surfing at “only” 34Mbit during peak hours.  But as a huge computer nerd I am not in that set, and I suspect the number of people who are seriously annoyed by oversubscription in Austin is a rounding error.<p>> However, there are lots and lots of other costs your ignoring. For instance, installing copper is not cheap.<p>I think we are in agreement here.  Essentially I am saying that the cost difference between routing 1 packet and routing 1,000,000 packets is negligible, because the cost to route 1 packet involves installing the copper/fiber (and upkeep apparently).<p>What you are saying is “Well, what if you need hundreds of megabits of speed at your apartment?”  And yeah, that is a problem, because in that case we need to run new cable/fiber.  But this is not really a “shared line” problem.  There is no service here that advertises a 300mbit shared line.  It doesn’t exist.<p>> But you have it backwards -- high-margin business connections subsidize cheap residential ones. Businesses pay for those two to three mile hops, and home users get cheaper access by virtue of being &#x27;on-the-way&#x27; to a business.<p>This seems absurd to me, to the point of being unbelievable.  It may be that business class fiber is installed first, because no ordinary resident will lease their own fiber.  However “installed first” and “subsidizes the cost of other subscribers” are two totally orthogonal things.<p>If you consider a fully-connected residential network, it spans a larger area, and has a lot more cable installed (and probably is a lot more expensive to build), than a fully-connected business network.  Thus, connecting an arbitrary business to a fully-connected residential network will always be cheaper than connecting an arbitrary residence to a fully-connected business network.  This doesn’t have anything to do with “first” or “second”, it has to do with the size and linear feet of cable and square mileage of coverage of one type of network when measured against the other.<p>> Every home user signs an agreement, that clearly states what is &quot;fair&quot;.  I&#x27;m not inventing or assuming a definition of &quot;fair&quot;, it&#x27;s spelled out in detail when you subscribe for service.<p>This is literally the COMPLETE relevant part of my residential-class internet connection terms of service from a major ISP:<p>> The Services are for your reasonable, personal non-commercial use only. You may not provide the Services to any person who is not a member or guest in your household, or to persons outside your premises, whether for a fee or otherwise. You will take reasonable precautions to prevent others from gaining unauthorized access to the Services.<p>Can I run an HTTP server?  I have no idea.  Can I use 2TB a month?  No clue.  There is absolutely nothing &quot;clear&quot; about what I can or cannot do with my internet connection, and if you think being &quot;clear&quot; and &quot;fair&quot; is standard business practice for ISPs in the United States you need a real reality check.",1381828797

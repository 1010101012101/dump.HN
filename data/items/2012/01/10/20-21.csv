3448982,comment,3447157,3448581,1,0,its_so_on,,,"it's not just that.  when there's a big jackpot at a casino at the slot machines (i.e. the jackpot hasn't been paid for a long, long time) and it is so large that the expected value of each drop of a quarter actually has positive expected value, by enough of a margin, someone with a huge bankroll comes along and hires teams of people to monopolize the slot machines until one wins, paying them by the hour.<p>you can't do that.<p>so, when you're faced with depositing a quarter, does it really matter if the expected value is positive or negative?  No, due to the variance - not due to how risk-averse you are, simply due to the variance.<p>Likewise at a startup: you only have one life, in which you can only do so many.  The more you can do, the less the variance and the more the expected value comes into play.<p>Of course Microsoft or Warren Buffett would never 'invest' in lottery tickets when these have a negative expected value; they can buy hundreds of thousands or millions of them.  When I buy one lottery ticket, I can buy one, or ten, but basically I have just one.  Only the variance matters.<p>it's not about risk-averse or -tolerant.  it's about utility.<p>people who say ""math is a tax on people who are bad at math"" simply don't know what they're talking about.  People who are stuck in a hopeless life that would be changed by $1 million have just as rational a reason to play the lottery given a negative or positive expected return.<p>one wonders if the lottery had to be subsidized by corporations, and everyone could only buy one to five tickets (if they wanted) each with an expected value slightly above one, then would mathematicians start buying 5 lottery tickets each?<p>It has nothing to do with risk-benefit ratio.  Even if God could somehow guarantee you access to googolplex googolplex googolplex dollars, but there was only a one in googolplex googolplex chance of your winning it, it would not even be worth the breath to say 'ok' -- try saying that googolplex times -- let alone a penny.  Yet the expected value of that proposition is googolplex dollars!  So, it's a false 'rationally' to claim that it is worth far more than a penny (given God's guarantee).  it's worth nothing.<p>it's not about risk-averse or whatever.  it's simple rationality as an agent who experiences utility here on Earth.<p>God's proposition is worthless.",1326229136

Throwing arbitrary buffers into functions meant for null-terminate strings will cause errors everywhere, not just in K&R example code.

They're asking for basic rule of law and enforcement of contracts.  Foxconn promised them money and then didn't pay it.  In Shenzen there is no practical way for the worker to force the company to pay.  The workers are screwed.<p>Getting your employer to pay up shouldn't require negotiation of any kind, much less 'negotiation' of this extreme nature.<p>I'm halfway through the TAL piece and this sort of thing is all that most workers are asking for; ""Pay my overtime.""

Does the author have a problem with it as well? Null-termination is a fundamental concept of C strings; there's no reason to shield C students from it.<p>The other example of ""bugs and bad style"" in this ""destruction"" of K&R C is a minor complaint about not using an optional set of braces.<p>I hope the remainder of the [incomplete] chapter demonstrates some actual bugs in the book's code, because it currently doesn't live up to the first paragraph's bluster.",1326228783

You can have one or the other, but not both.<p>OF COURSE static type inference is hard.  That's a straightforward consequence of the halting problem.  Pointing to defmethod is just an oblique way of making the point that perfect type inference is NOT NECESSARY for getting things done.  You can choose to lament the complexity of Scala (and static type inferencing in general) or you can use Lisp or Python and trade certain compile-time guarantees for simplicity.  Like I said, reasonable people can disagree over which is preferable.<p>What reasonable people cannot do is insist that there is a single perfect solution that is both simple and error-free.  Anyone who believes that has not understood the implications of the halting problem.<p>Another thing reasonable people cannot do is frame the tradeoff as a binary choice: either you use static type inferencing, or you give up all compile-time guarantees.  That is simply not true, as is amply demonstrated by e.g. the SBCL compiler.  It's a complex, multi-dimensional space of tradeoffs in language design, compiler complexity, and different kinds of compile-time guarantees.  It's INHERENTLY complicated.  The best you can hope to do is find a reasonable point in the design space for your particular quality metric.  For the OP, Scala isn't it.",1326228290

Further, they apparently would be OK with those conditions if they got more money.<p>That suggests they don't consider them inhumane, (not justified regardless of pay) rather they are economically unjust.<p>The truth of whether or not they are economically unjust (in a market driven economy, which China isn't really) is that if they quit there will be no one else to fill those roles (economic scarcity created by a price imbalance). However if there are people who will fill those roles at the prices offered, then they will simply be out of a job.<p>It is always true in market controlled transactions that the buyer thinks they are paying too much for a good and the seller thinks they are paying too little. It's the fulcrum that creates the equilibrium point for the price of a good or service.<p>So in a dispassionate economic way one can say the employees are working to maximize their own economic value.  If by periodically pulling stunts like this gets them more pay then they are doing their part to improve their economic station at the expense of the company. The company of course may try to use that to increase the price they charge to assemble such devices, and perhaps give some of that increase to their working staff.<p>Saying that their other option is to 'starve' seems improbable in a country that is based on the communist teachings of Mao and Marx. One might presume (but I don't know since I don't live there) that there are state jobs available. I could certainly understand it if those state jobs were less desirable.

3448846,comment,3447907,3447907,4,0,jxcole,,,"Not correct. This is one of the things I dislike about the constitution and why when someone tells me I should go into law, I say that I would hate it. When the constitution says ""freedom of speech"", it has nothing to do with speech. What it is interpreted as is ""freedom to express one's opinions"". To be sure, this is better than freedom of speech. Speech is something that you do with your mouth. Freedom of speech does not explicitly protect your freedom to write stuff down, much less freedom to transmit information across a wire. It is only about speech.<p>I wish the constitution actually said ""freedom to express one's opinion"". The problem with the way it is now is that the supreme court could easily take away our freedom of expression. Right now, they interpret freedom of speech to be freedom of expression but in the future they may change their minds and decide that ""freedom of speech"" really means ""freedom to cook waffles"".<p>There really isn't that much correlation between what the law says and what we actually get out of it.<p>But back to the main point, ""freedom to express one's opinions"" may not be limited by copyright monopoly. Copyright is over a particular way to express a particular set of opinions or facts, not over the opinions or facts themselves, so copyright doesn't apply.",1326227249

WordPress is very good at what it does, and Im in no way down on it for that; its just that the needs of my small company<i></i> is now very different that the options WordPress gives us. There's no real drama there.<p>What has driven this decision though, is that sites that could/should/have-already been running nicely on WordPress have really been let down by a number of changes in the 3 releases in the last year. We deal with a lot of smaller government and charity websites - which don't pay well - and they simply can't handle the AdminUI changing every 16 weeks. To us techies thats a long time, to your average ""Joe Public"", thats quite a lot. Given that most of these people have really strict usage requirements (colour blind, no use of mouse, etc) the new WordPress 3.3 AdminUI is shockingly inaccessible.<p>So much of the change involved in the WordPress product is horribly unmanaged. And thats ok, it's free software. For our small company, this doesn't work for us anymore, so we move on.

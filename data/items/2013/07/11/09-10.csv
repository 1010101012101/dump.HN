Tey wanted a Lisp that ran as fast and as memory efficient as C, so that they could write the OS in Lisp.<p>That&#x27;s why they put a lot of thought into the sealing functionality (<a href=""http://jim.studt.net/dirm/interim-36.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jim.studt.net/dirm/interim-36.html</a>) and into limited types. For example, you can store a &#x27;integer between zero and a hundred or letter of the alphabet or NULL&#x27; in a single byte. Expressing that in C is cumbersome, as you would need wrapper functions or macros, would need to remember using them, etc. A sufficiently advanced Dylan compiler could figure out a representation of its own.<p>Pascal-like syntax was bolted on later when they tried to bring the compiler to the masses.

You can &quot;easily&quot; do text protocols that are picky about field lengths and that use formats that can be parsed much faster than the more complex protocols.<p>If your protocol is using a small enough, regular enough grammar, it&#x27;d also be fairly trivial to allow a binary serialisation of requests or responses as an option without much extra overhead. E.g. start client connections with a word indicating it wants to &quot;switch on&quot; binary and length prefix any variable length fields instead of relying on an end of field marker, for example. (Or make human clients type out a word to switch to the text serialisation).<p>But very few protocols are so affected by latency in request/response exchanges that binary vs. text is a huge deal. For HTTP moving to a pure binary protocol might make sense because of how heavily we depend on it. But most protocols are not HTTP.",1373536447
6025218,comment,6024383,6024774,1,0,cstross,,,"(a) Real flight simulators are expensive (cost is an order of magnitude less than a real airliner, but still in the millions, and they require skilled operators to put the pilots through their paces),<p>(b) <i>As I understand it</i>, commercial pilots get paid on the basis of a rather paltry salary, topped up to a much higher rate per flying hour. So there&#x27;s a strong wage incentive for them to jump in the cockpit of a real plane as fast as possible and get their experience that way rather than spending lots of time training in the simulators.<p>(c) Modern airliners spend a lot, or even most, of their time on autopilot. Which is not &quot;the plane flies itself&quot; -- it&#x27;s more like a very complicated cruise control system in a car: you still need to observe and monitor what&#x27;s going on around you and periodically change some settings governing the vehicle&#x27;s behaviour. (Just as cruise control won&#x27;t save you from a bend in the road or an idiot on the other side of the highway crossing the central divider, autopilots need constant supervision.)<p>But this is not &quot;hand flying&quot;.  Hand flying mostly comes down to take-off, landing, and brown-pants moments, which is a small fraction of the time a long-haul jet spends in operation.

A lot of unskilled people take offense at unsolicited advice, particularly if they&#x27;re so unskilled as to deem themselves the best player on the team. It doesn&#x27;t help that the game tracks somewhat superficial stats such as kills and deaths; a score that can run counter to the actual <i>hidden score</i> in the game: gold/experience differential.

If you want to distrust any hardware, it makes sense to focus on communication peripherals such as network cards, wifi/gsm modems etc.<p>For example the baseband processors in phones contain a complicated firmware of 16 MB+. This contains many hidden diagnostic modes on various subsystem levels. Baseband processors have been known to be exploited remotely, and as they have direct connection to the main CPU, giving full control over the device, including GPS, camera etc.<p>There have also been bugs in wired networking hardware in which specially crafted packets resulted in low-level crashes.

6025210,comment,6024383,6024935,20,0,omegant,,,"In modern planes there is a filter on the warning computer that doesnt allow to show certain non vital failures between 80 knots (or 100 depending the plane) and V1. For example an engine fire is going to trigger the alarm, but not an engine EGT (exhaust gas temp) over limit. But the list of warnings not shown, and the ones shown but that must be ignored, are different from plane to plane. Thats why this instructor was doing this test, to make them learn that the 777 had a different list and requirements from the previous one. Mind you that after youve been in 2 or 3 different planes its easy to react automatically but with the previous plane list.<p>Its known that pilots are oversensitive to warnings during take off. A rejected take off is a dangerous maneuver that must be avoided if unnecessary, and is trained in each simulator session. This is more important in wide body airliners like the 747, 777, A340 or A380, as their take off weight is so high that a RTO (rejected take off) will blowout some tires (of the main landing gear) due to the stress or the temperature increase inside the tire created by the brakes. Once the plane is stopped, it has to wait isolated at the taxiway because there are temperature plugs at the tires that may blow out, nobody can get close during that time. If the weight is too high they will even burn as the brakes will be white hot. Look at youtube for a certification RTO of a big plane to see it, or some brake energy absorption test at the laboratory, to see how much energy they have to mannage.<p>In this case(the simulator story) a after cargo door is one of those warnings that you have to ignore as the plane will flight without problems, then you may turn around and make a landing after dumping some fuel(to decrease the weight).<p>Hope this helps<p>Edit: some clarification<p>Below 80 it is possible to RTO without problems as the speed is still low. Once you reach V1 you will NEVER RTO! as this speed is calculated taking in to account the runway length, and in such a manner that if you RTO at V1, the runway remaining once you have stopped is just a couple dozen of meters.\nThe V1 is so high because that way, when you become airborne, youll have a better climb gradient even with an engine fail. All this stuff is calculated with an engine fail, after all it is the most important and probable fail you will encounter (the reverse deployment on take-off is much more severe but thankfully very very rare), and that will affect your climb capability.<p>Edit 2: added-improved some punctuation.",1373536194

You&#x27;d get the same benefits if people just constrained the text protocols. E.g. Your performance &quot;hack&quot; for HTTP request methods is only a hack because method names can be variable length. We could constrain method names to 4 bytes and make the whole thing cleaner while still getting the text protocol benefits of being able to manually inspect request/responses. Similarly, picking a sane date format like iso-8601 and restricting it further to a specific set of options would do wonders while still being readable/writable for humans.<p>I do agree with you that once a protocol gets as widespread as HTTP most of the benefit is lost as we get better tools to use anyway, though.  Especially with debug tools built into most browsers these days.<p>The issue is not that non-text protocols are impossible to analyse, but that each new non-text protocol requires new tools to do so. For IP, UDP and TCP we&#x27;ve had decades to create good tools. If a common binary serialisation format was agreed and most protocols stuck to that, it would be much less of a big deal to ditch text-only protocols and rely on client side tools to allow reading or manipulating them as text.",1373534891

6025111,comment,6024383,6024383,6,0,brettnak,,,"Since a lot of this has been coming up I thought many people might like to know the basics of how the auto-thrust system is used.  Some of this information could be slightly inaccurate so if a real pilot wants to correct anything here, that would be great.  The auto-pilot setting for autothrust (<i>A/T</i>) has a lot of modes.  You dont specifically set the mode so much as a combination of settings can affect the mode that its in.  The modes are the following (this is fairly generic and probably not  exactly how the 777 system works):<p><i>A/T</i> by itself will simply hold a specified airspeed by adjusting the Thrust Levers.<p><i>A/T</i> + <i>FL/CH</i> + <i>V/S</i> +  <i>Alititude Hold</i>: (Auto-Thrust + Flight Level Change + Vertical Speed + Altitude Hold) climb or descend to the set altitude by the set vertical speed at the specified airspeed.  The thrust levers are maniplated by the system.  Generally once the altitude is attained, V/S and FL/CH will turn off.<p><i>A/T</i> + V/S: The same as the above but with no set altitude.<p><i>A/T</i> + <i>Thrust Hold</i>: I looked at the 777 main control panel and I couldnt find the setting for Thrust Hold, however it seems to be referred to in various things on the internet and I just dont know what to look for.  This setting is normally used for takeoff (maybe landing?) where the pilot sets an airspeed and a thrust (via the thrust levers) and the airspeed is regulated by pitching the aircraft up or down.<p><i>A/T</i> + <i>Thrust Hold</i> + <i>FL/CH</i> + <i>Altitude Hold</i>: This setting is similar to the one above, but without setting a vertical speed.  The indicated airspeed is controlled via pitching the aircraft up or down until the specified altitude is reached.  I believe once the altitude is reached FL/CH mode is switched off as well as Thrust Hold.<p>This is my best guess as to what the 5 modes the NTSB says the 777 has.  If any pilots could correct anything Im missing or that is simply wrong, that would be great.<p>Switching between modes is really not intuitive because youre fiddling with settings and its hard to know what button press is actually going to tell the system to do something.  If youre interested in how confusing it can actually be, Id recommend installing the x-plane trial and trying to mess with these settings.<p>If you want to give it a go, the beginners tutorial for x-plane & the 777 has you do a visual landing on 28L @ KSFO<p><a href=""http://wiki.x-plane.com/777_beginners_tutorial#Landing_the_777_at_KSFO"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.x-plane.com/777_beginners_tutorial#Landing_the_7...</a>",1373533683

We&#x27;re pretty clearly within a transition from manned to unmanned combat aircraft, and given the lack of compelling threats flying top-end fighter aircraft (or fielding top AA defenses), there&#x27;s no reason we couldn&#x27;t keep the F-16/F-15/F-18 in service (and whatever F-22s we already purchased) for another 10-20 years, then replace entirely with drones.<p>Drones aren&#x27;t just cheaper, they&#x27;re <i>better</i>.  Smaller, higher G loading, less radar cross-section, no need for SAR when one goes down, potential for &quot;in extremis&quot; one-way missions (intentionally sacrificing a $5mm reusable drone to accomplish a mission is often fine), etc.  The only thing they don&#x27;t do is create as many senior officers with flight experience.<p>(They also don&#x27;t cost as much money, so to the extent you believe every dollar spent on defense, needed or not, is a dollar stolen from humanity, ...)",1373533452

The obvious difference is top speed as drag does not increase linearly with length.  But you also gain the ability to do takeoffs and landings in a wider range of weather conditions as well as having redundant nuclear reactors and dentists etc.  But, perhapse most importantly the larger the aircraft carrier the larger aircraft it can support and there are many advantages to having larger aircraft.",1373533379

2761297,comment,2760495,2760776,1,0,insin,,,"I started coming to a similar conclusion about pure-JavaScript templating in terms of ease of writing and maintenance after getting most of the way into implementing a templating plugin for my DOMBuilder library, based on this speculative API extracted from a sample Django template: <a href=""https://gist.github.com/958838"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/958838</a><p>Once you start piling on the mixed, nested content and a mix of elements with and without attributes, it takes some diligence to ensure you've put all your commas and parentheses in the right place first time, and the resulting code isn't all that pleasing on the eye when you compare it to the usual HTML with placeholders for logic/dynamic content.<p>I still find this style of templating useful for smaller chunks of content like this sort of thing, though:<p><pre><code>  function dataTable(headers, objects, properties) {\n    return TABLE({cellSpacing: 1, 'class': 'data sortable'}\n    , THEAD(TR(TH.map(headers)))\n    , TBODY(TR.map(objects, function(obj, attrs, loop) {\n        attrs['class'] = (loop.index % 2 == 0 ? 'odd', 'even')\n        return TD.map(properties, function(prop) {\n          return obj[prop]\n        })\n      }))\n    )\n  }</code></pre>",1310605109

And since human nature limits the size of group that can work together, the only way I can imagine for larger groups to avoid tree structure would be to have no structure: to have each group actually be independent, and to work together the way components of a market economy do.<p>That might be worth exploring. I suspect there are already some highly partitionable businesses that lean this way. But I don't know any technology companies that have done it.</i><p>This is the most interesting bit in the whole article, to me.

Certain niceties of MVC break down once your project falls outside of the mold of a cookie-cutter CRUD app interfacing with a 100% Microsoft ecosystem.  People have levied a similar criticism against Django (once you color too far outside the lines, things get hard fast) but with MVC it can creep up on you much faster.<p>MVC shines if you treat it like a lightweight MVC framework and don't get caught up in doing things the ""Microsoft"" way -- this is massively counter-intuitive to anyone coming from a Python or Ruby background, who prefer to code in an idiomatic way by default.  You can take advantage of its powerful routing system, various helper functions, and a decent templating language: Razor - which I hope Microsoft keeps and doesn't replace like it did to the 2 or 3 other templating syntax systems that proceeded it.",1310604626

The trip to Kenya will provide the ideal opportunity for all one hundred and twenty participants to demonstrate their spirit of generosity and hard work in a place where it is so genuinely needed and appreciated. Titan Alarm was not content to simply contribute financially to important global causes. Instead, the one hundred and twenty participants insisted upon going above and beyond by both donating significant earnings from their sales but also giving their time and energies by traveling the globe and working on important projects within the local communities in rather primitive conditions. This level of devotion and sacrifice is a source of inspiration not only to the people they are helping, but even more to the participants themselves.

2761237,comment,2754725,2756168,2,0,leot,,,"Further reply from study author in response to my message stating that I had posted his reply to this forum, and pointed him to it:<p>===<p>Thanks for your interest.  With regard to filling the air gap region with conductive fluid, the problem is that frictional shearing losses become prohibitively large even at low rotation speeds.  Its not that it wouldnt work at all, but that it wouldnt work very well;  thermal conductivity is important, but so is viscosity.<p>There a number of other issues that apparently have caused confusion as well.  Maybe we can use this forum to provide clarification.  Please feel free to post what follows.<p>It appears that many people were unclear about what I was attempting to convey with regard to the subject of dust fouling.  I did not mean to imply that there is literally no dust fouling; some dust accumulation eventually becomes visible to the naked eye on the very leading edge of the blades.  The point is that dust fouling is reduced to such a large extent that we are unable to detect any degradation of cooling performance operating the device in a relatively dirty environment over an extended period of time. Thus for all intents and purposes the dust fouling problem has been taken of the table.  In contrast, with conventional CPU coolers, eventually the entire heat exchanger surface becomes entombed in dust.<p>Some people have expressed concern that such a rotating heat-sink-impeller would constitute a safety hazard.  Any real world device would include a screen, grill, or other form of protective enclosure.  Such protective measures are widely used on conventional fans.  We photographed our device without an enclosure so that it would be easier for people to see what it looks like.<p>There seems to be confusion about where the potential for significant electricity savings resides.  The vast majority of it is associated with applications such as air conditioning and refrigeration, not electronics cooling.  But such energy sector applications will only materialize if air bearing heat exchanger technology proves amenable to size scaling.  We are in the process of evaluating this question.<p>Many have expressed skepticism about the practicality of a 0.001 air gap.  Thats certainly understandable, and it was one of the first things we investigated.  After all, if the requirement for a small air gap precludes the possibility of low-cost manufacturing, reliability, etc. then I would be the first to agree that all of this is a pointless exercise.  The end-of-project report has a discussion of why this is not the case.  Another counter-intuitive point is that air bearings are extremely mechanically stiff, rugged and reliable.  This is also discussed the report.<p>On a related subject, many were concerned about the manufacturability of the heat-sink-impeller.  We are converging on cold forging as the best route to low cost fabrication.  We understand that if we cant drive the cost down that air bearing heat exchanger technology will have little impact.<p>Others have pointed out that intuitively it would seem like the last thing youd want to do is intentionally introduce an air gap (rather than something like thermal grease) in the thermal conduction path between the CPU and heat exchanger.  Qualitatively this sounds like a persuasive argument.  But as discussed in the report, quantitatively, the numbers (gap distance, gap area, thermal conductivity of air, enhancement of conductivity by convection) work out quite well.  For a 10 cm diameter device, an air gap resistance of 0.02 C/W is certainly feasible.<p>Another important point is that the version 1 prototype device discussed in this report is badly unoptimized.  The main objective for version 1 was to test our hypotheses regarding the advantages of such a device architecture.  If things continue to go well in lab, I suspect eventually well end up at about 0.05 C/W for a 10 cm diameter device thats of order 3 cm high, operates at three to four thousand rpm, and consumes about 5 watts of electrical power.  But believe it when you see it.  Theres always risk involved in try to solve tough problems.  Were giving it our best shot.  Were also working on alternative device geometries that may be capable of providing considerably better performance.<p>What else? A couple people stated that the thermal brick wall is at 4 GHz, not 3 GHz.  Fair enough.  My point is that if you introduce a drastic improvement in thermal management technology, whatever the number for thermal brick wall may be, it gets pushed a lot higher.<p>Other people had questions about why such a heat-sink-impeller is so quiet.  What it boils down to is that youve got a lot more flexibility with regard to blade geometry than you do with a fan.  That means you are free to design the blade geometry to smoothly split and smoothly rejoin the flow field at the impeller entrance and exit; the device architecture allows you to decouple the engineering constraints of adequate air flow and low noise.<p>A couple of people surmised that the air bearing heat exchanger requires a source of compressed air because we used a hydrostatic air bearing in the version 1 device.  As described in the report, in a real-world device youd use a hydrodynamic (or self pressurizing) air bearing.  Thats what were using now in versions 2 and 3.  The use of a hydrostatic bearing in version 1 was an experimental convenience.<p>I have to go to a 5:30 meeting, so I will leave it at that.  Hopefully people will find portions of the above material informative.<p>Sincerely,\nJeff Koplow\nSandia National Labs\nLivermore, CA",1310603438

That will make bootstrapping harder, favoring existing enterprises.  This is clearly not an unalloyed benefit to society.<p>The existence of a reasonable 'free' product may also deter the entrance of multiple competitors who would have advanced the state of the art.  Clearly this is bad for society.<p>I'm not arguing that this always happens, or that free software is inherently bad.

Focus on doing your duty as well as you can, regardless of the context.<p>In other words, imagine your boss says that the web app must be written in C++ for political reasons, and you cannot convince him to switch to Ruby on Rails, and you just <i>know</i> that the project would die a slow painful death if written in C++.  Well, supposing you are correct, you are in a crappy job:  constrained to do the wrong thing and with a boss that cannot be convinced otherwise.  And for whatever reason you've got to stick it out through this project.<p>Focus on being the <i>best</i> C++ web developer in the world.  Do the absolute best job you can on the tasks that are assigned to you.  Throw yourself into your work 110%.  But to do this you have to shift your point of view.  You cannot think about this as ""wasted effort"" since you know the project will ultimately fail.  You must think about this as training.  You are putting your mind through intense training, keeping your skills sharp, so that when the opportunity finally does come to leave your job (or perhaps a new boss comes along), your mind is in top form and ready to go.  Sure, you've probably acquired some less than useful skills for web development (managing pointers) but you've probably acquired and maintained some very good transferrable skills.<p>Whatever you do, don't give up, because then your skills will atrophy.",1310602156

If Bricklin had known he was going to have to compete with free in a matter of a few months after release, he might have done something else entirely.<p>This may be hard to understand for people that haven't ever designed anything difficult, but frankly, it's _so_ much easier to clone something than build it the first time. Even just knowing that something is possible is a huge leg up.<p>If you think routinized F/OSS cloning of software is an actual service to innovation, you need your head examined. If nothing else, it makes going into a patent frenzy with every idea far more tempting.<p>It's hard for me to prove a counterfactual, of course, and show all the wonderful things that have been discouraged by the prospect of immediate shitty open source clones.\nI fully accept that open source allows us to build innovative things on top of other software layers - it's not necessarily all bad.

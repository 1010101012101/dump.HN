If anything,  I think these are things that are good in _addition_ to our current system,  but as a replacement I think it&#x27;s a bit of a pipe dream.<p>Further,  I take issue with the whole notion of the United States being a society &quot;dominated by the police.&quot;  It looks like we have just the right amount[1],  so it seems to me that the issue is lack of training,  accountability and open reporting combined with effective police review that are likely to be our problems.<p>1: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_number_of_police_officers"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_number_of_...</a>",1419051539
8775909,comment,8773097,8774353,0,0,tanzam75,,,"> <i>A), ambitious and unrealistic are not mutually exclusive. It was ambitious and unrealistic to attempt a moon landing in under a decade.</i><p>That&#x27;s absolutely not true.  It was ambitious <i>and totally  realistic</i> to attempt a moon landing in 10 years.<p>Kennedy only selected that goal after von Braun said that it could be done &quot;by 1967/68&quot;.  He even added an extra two years of padding, just in case von Braun was being optimistic.<p>Anyone who knew anything about space flight knew that Kennedy&#x27;s goal was achievable.  In fact, some thought that von Braun was gold-plating the program unnecessarily.  McDonnell did some engineering studies for landing <i>one</i> man on the moon using Gemini and a Saturn C-3 (about half the payload capacity of a Saturn V).<p>If 90% of civil engineers would say in 2013 that Elon Musks hyperloop plan was realistic, then it would be where the moon landing was in 1961.  But they wouldn&#x27;t.  In comparison to the moon landing, Elon Musk&#x27;s hyperloop was wildly unrealistic.",1419051476

A lot of the leaked information makes them look very bad.<p>If you are trying to say that the movie not being leaked means the movie never existed, that doesn&#x27;t make sense. If North Korea did hack Sony, they would not leak the movie because they hate the movie and don&#x27;t want anyone to see it. If a group of other hackers hacked Sony and are pretending to be North Korea (compiling code on computers with the Korean language), then they wouldn&#x27;t leak the movie because North Korea wouldn&#x27;t leak it and they are pretending to be North Korea.",1419051472

They likely would reduce the amount of policing and supplement traditional policing, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;ll eliminate the need.  It&#x27;s not as if all countries conspired and said, let&#x27;s all have a police force!<p>I think the policing grows out of necessity.  It&#x27;s not as if there aren&#x27;t lawless places where there is either little police or no police.  Those places exist, for the most part, most people would choose to live in a different place where there are decently funded police.  I&#x27;m not saying &#x27;militarized&#x27; police are necessary or desired, but i think large societies need a force (people or robotic) which enforce the rules (reasonable/constitutionally sound) out by the population at large.

8775879,comment,8771795,8773783,0,0,Juan_Shapiro,,,"What impact will big changes like these have on an eventual stable release of Rust? My team has been reading about Rust for a long time now, and we&#x27;ve tried it out, but we just can&#x27;t deal with the constant change. We need a language that offers what Rust can offer, but we also need our code to still work without changes a few months after we write it. Earlier this year we were hearing that a stable release of Rust would be out before the end of 2014. But that clearly isn&#x27;t going to happen. The latest I read was that it&#x27;s now supposed to be ready sometime in March 2015 at the earliest. I understand that software schedules slip, and that it&#x27;s important to get things done right the first time around whenever possible, but getting out a stable release of Rust just seems to be dragging on and on! I really, really hope that Rust 1 is available by this upcoming March, but if history is any indication, that may be unlikely to happen.

Yes, sometimes things go great but often you are dealing with pests and diseases that require time, knowledge, and capital to resolve.  If you can&#x27;t make that commitment, then you just won&#x27;t have any yield for that crop that year.<p>Self-sustainable living is an interest of mine, and one of my peeves is seeing folks on YouTube or Reddit posting tutorials on how to build a home hydroponic garden when it&#x27;s clear that they have just finished building it.  If you can keep it running for a couple of years, then that&#x27;s when I would be interested in hearing more about it.",1419049084

Firstly, there was always at least one person advocating for the change. They could make improvements over time, educate other engineers, and react to feedback. Secondly, changes won out on merit. Engineers used new abstractions because they were better, not because they were new. Sometimes abstractions didn&#x27;t work. And were expunged from the codebase.",1419048402

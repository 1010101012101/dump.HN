One could go further and say that it is not even a sigmoid because all web traffic will peter off eventually, with the eventuality in the undefined horizon. \nDoes anyone really assume an exponential growth in the literal sense with users rushing in via some inter-galactic network when all earth users are exhausted?\n",1196110743

83687,comment,83580,83678,0,0,sethjohn,,,"It's not much of a distinction mathematically, but it's an important distinction in emphasis. Saying something is growing exponentially does imply that it will just keep on growing, at least for a long while. Saying growth is sigmoidal emphasizes the eventual slowdown.<p>Talking about ""exponential growth"" often leads people into unrealistic hyperbole. Of course, by ""people"" I mean marketers, investment advisors, and headline writers at Business Week...not us rational computer scientists!",1196109318
83686,comment,83538,83538,0,0,uuilly,,,"A few thoughts on ad supported SW:<p>-It's interesting how TV is moving towards a pay-per episode model (HBO orignals, ITMS and netflix) and SW is going towards advertising.  I haven't owned a TV in 10 years b/c ads became so intolerable.  But I now rent / buy TV episodes commercial free (I missed the TIVO revolution.)  I'm the type of consumer who would rather pay for something and not deal with ads / potential privacy violations.<p>-People can only spend so much time on the interweb in a day.  And a site has to go nuclear to make real money off ads.  So if you're going to make money off ads you have to steal traffic from google, yahoo and FB etc or you have to grab traffic from emerging net markets.  \n",1196109060
83685,story,,,29,22,e1ven,"A hack I'm rather proud of",,"A few months ago, my partner and I purchased Chron X, the original online collectible card game. It was first written in 1995-1997, and brought a lot of ideas to the table which were later implemented by Magic the Gathering Online, and other collectible card games.<p>We're working to make a new version of the game, that's web-based, free to play, and easier for anyone.. But until it's done, we had the question of ""How to we keep the old game going long enough to transition?""<p>One of the key problems with the old game is that games are peer to peer. While the game server authenticates users, the actual card battles have one client connect directly to the other, and play directly.<p>This worked out well in 1997, in the age of dialup and open ports, but today almost everyone has a firewall, either in software or as a Linksys router.. They just can't get through to play, and the popularity has taken a corresponding hit. We're excited to work toward the new web version, but until we do, we want to help the player base grow, which means we needed to slay the firewall demon.<p>I had started looking into Hamachi, which creates a direct machine to machine VPN, and lets users connect to one another. Sounds pretty decent... The problem is, it's free for up to 16 users, but after that, users would need to pay $5/month, just to be able to connect... Given that they'd be paying a monthly fee, and we wouldn't even see it, that's a pretty big negative.\nThe second problem is that since it puts everyone on a VPN, BOTH players would need to have it installed to play, not just the player behind a firewall.<p>Instead, I put together a hack that I'm rather proud of.. I hacked together OpenVPN to put together a quick click-and-run installer, which creates a VPN into our servers.. Unlike the Hamachi VPN, however, our VPN assigns each user a public, routable, IP address, on the outside world, such as 72.10.x.y.z.<p>Then, we set their default gateway to go through the VPN, and block all ports except for our game.<p>What this does is give them a public, routable, real IP address, which can only be used for contacting other Chron X clients.<p>What I really like about this solution is that it's expandable to any other game system.. If you wanted to run a Diablo 2 tunnel, it'd be just a few configuration changes to open up those ports, and <i>bam</i>, it'd just work.<p>Players each have a public ip and can play against each other, and we get keep the old client workable for a while longer, while we get more done on Chron X 2.<p>I'm just excited, and wanted to share the hack ;)<p>-Colin",1196109023

83680,comment,83569,83670,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Designing a computer system (and that means everything but the coding) is constructing an intermediate vocabulary and language such that, when things change, your intermediate language can already express the new conditions. Now you can do that with functional code and a DSL, or you can do that with OOP and a class model. Since you're going to .NET, let's assume OOP.<p>\nYou've got two things to do before coding: analysis and design. Analysis is understanding and creating that language I spoke about. Design is implementing a solution with that new language inside a certain environment. Coding is actually detailed design -- it's the same thing. In OOP you (generally) move smoothly from talking to the users about their world to coding the computer. In greenfield programming there are no major jumps like you would have with waterfall. The goal of all of this A&D is to get classes, code units, tables -- big hunks of stuff that will organize your code. Small systems you should be able to burn through A&D in days or hours. Big systems can take much longer.<p>\nNow there's all kinds of tricks to making good languages, er, object graphs. Too much to go into here. Just remember that the purpose of OOP is that when the customer says ""But I'd like that green if the bank account balance is over $200"" that you should be looking to tweak something regarding the class BankAccount and the member ""Balance"" -- the customer's language is your language. This is what makes OOP rule large development work.<p>\nNow that's the 5-cent version of OOP. As for ""What to do, when"" it's real simple -- do the stuff the team worries about. Having said that, it's perfectly fine to use a ""recipe book"" like RUP, MSF, Agile, etc to help you remember stuff you should be worrying about. In general, just like in coding where you move from talking to the folks to making the code happen, you should be thinking of ""stuff to worry about"" starting with business concepts ""Do we know what they want? Are they going to pay for it? Do we have access to the key players?"" Then you move towards technical concepts like ""Are we sure a relational database is going to handle this load?"" or ""There's no way the user is going to wait more than 5 seconds at his browser"" But there's no rule -- you can have killer business risks later in the project and you can have killer technical risks earlier. The trick is to be constantly moving from big, fuzzy, general, business-type worries to little, clear, specific, technical-type worries. If you get your ""conceptual cone"" working in a project -- designing and managing from big concepts down to little concepts -- it's like riding downhill on a greased rail.<p>\nI've probably proven myself a complete idiot for trying to take on such a huge topic in a blog post, but there's a lot of ""noise"" on this subject: the core principles are not supposed to be rocket science.",1196108619

The growth of real-world things clearly has some upper bound, and in saying that it's ""exponential"" this is understood by all listeners.<p>Since calling a real-world trend ""exponential growth"" is always an approximation, pointing out that it's actually ""approximately sigmoidal growth, i.e. only approximately exponential until it flattens out sometime in the eventual future"" is (you guessed it) a redundant waste of breath.<p>And to say that pointless pedantry is the same as ""mathematical literacy"" is even sillier.",1196108340

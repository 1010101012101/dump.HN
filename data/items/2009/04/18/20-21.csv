568721,comment,568686,568686,0,0,pmjordan,,,"There are numerous implications of choosing POST or GET.<p>First off, the HTTP specification requires that GET (and HEAD) requests be idempotent^W EDIT: <i>side effect free</i> to enable caching. Clearly, violations of this abound; however, proxy servers and other infrastructure will often hold you to this rule, so make sure you know what you're doing. (proxies and clients are permitted to withhold or arbitrarily repeat GET requests without changing the outcome)<p>Second, security: although AJAX in the strictest sense falls under the same-origin policy, you can quite easily make GET requests to foreign hosts in JavaScript by creating SCRIPT, IMG or IFRAME elements with appropriate SRC attributes, whereas you'll struggle to create a foreign-host POST. Inappropriate use of GET is therefore the enabler of XSRF attacks. CAUTION: read petewarden's reply regarding XSRF attacks via POST forms.<p>Third, data size, as others have said. URLs are notoriously problematic for conveying any information other than short text.<p>Fourth, if web crawlers get hold of any URLs which exhibit side effects on GET, they will wreak havoc on your site. (though this can admittedly be alleviated by judicious use of robots.txt)<p>Finally, you seem to imply that POST requests will not or cannot generate a response similar to GET. This is not the case, responses to POST work in the same way. (except it must not be cached) The deciding factor is the nature of the <i>request</i> (side effect or no side effect), not the nature of the response.",1240087464
568720,comment,568686,568686,0,0,jaxn,,,"In addition to request size limits, using the HTTP methods on server side code can simplify code. If I GET a person record then send it down, if I POST a person record then process the passed parameters. With that separation I may find that POST requests do not require sending any data to the client (other than a success indicator). That reduces bandwidth and improves client response time.<p>I have really grown to appreciate this simplification while working with webpy on AppEngine. I think that my request handlers are about the cleanest they have ever been.",1240087384

A lot of images are posted every day and the quality of submissions are great (even though there is no filtering of the front page). It's been a really fun project to work on and some features we could build out include: user karma system, image recommendation engine (half built), embeddable image galleries, more fb connect features, twitter integration, etc..<p>I no longer feel like devoting my full (after work/weekend) resources to this project, so I'm basically looking for someone who wants to pick up development of the site and have part ownership. I'm totally open to open sourcing it or turning it into a more ning like service, where anyone can get their own image sharing community running. Definitely some cool stuff we could do.<p>If your interested feel free to ask some questions here or email me at hello@imgfave.com",1240086857
568708,comment,568557,568684,0,0,snprbob86,,,"The truth of the whole thing is that Google primarily relies on _behavior_ to detect bots. Captures are just an added layer of defense and serve as a pretty good way of seeding the behavior database. If some user appears to be a bot, serve them a captcha. If they fail, then that behavior was bot-like. Google is using captchas as a way to learn image recognition as well as bot behavior patterns. They know full well that they won't be able to rely on captchas for ever, but they will sure as hell collect as much data out of them as possible.",1240086826

But wasn't AJAX created as a work-around for POST? Correct me if I'm wrong but POST is primarily a method for the server not the client, while GET behaves more like the web today (2.0) in that users spend more time requesting stuff (an xhr that passes some value who in turn returns with a response) from a server rather than writing or executing stuff on that server.<p>If anything AJAX seems like it was made especially for GET to cut-down on how much and what was being passed with POST...I might be way off, but does it not seem contradictory to POST something in AJAX without returning a response?",1240085703

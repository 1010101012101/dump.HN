The whole point of drone is to carry out mission 24/7 as much as possible, because a pilot can&#x27;t fly back and forth without sleeping. Also, humans have emotions they don&#x27;t always follow orders.<p>> incredibly difficult for the best analysts to identify if someone has weapons for sure<p>I have always thought the military fly drones to carry out specific mission, such as taking photos or launching an attack. And the latter is usually confirmed by some &quot;intelligence&quot;. I want to see how many drone attacks were performed without a single human intelligence confirmation.<p>> But here&#x27;s the thing: I may not have been on the ground in Afghanistan, but I watched parts of the conflict in great detail on a screen for days on end<p>This is best seen in the movie Black Hawk Down (2001), based on true story.",1388332771
6979932,comment,6979778,6979778,26,0,fit2rule,,,"I think that one thing we &#x27;normals&#x27; don&#x27;t seem to understand, is that when you are in the business of killing, murdering, maiming other human beings, you&#x27;re no longer really part of society.  Society is determined by the survival of its members - start removing them, and you get a lesser society.  That is obvious.<p>But we in the &#x27;normal&#x27; society don&#x27;t have a clue what those in the &#x27;murdering business society&#x27; really think about us.  More often than not, you&#x27;ll find that the &#x27;official killers&#x27; really don&#x27;t care about human life - or else they wouldn&#x27;t be devoting their time on earth to the singular purpose of killing, maiming, destroying life.<p>Its a simple fact that if you get up in the morning with the intention of taking a human life, if ordered to do so, then you no longer belong to the human race.  You belong to something else.  Not a single one of us in the &#x27;normal society&#x27; can entertain the thought of killing someone, on a daily basis, and not suffer consequences.  How is it then for those who spend their entire lives working to be the best possible killers they&#x27;re allowed to be?",1388332763

6979928,comment,6978587,6979789,3,0,matthewmacleod,,,"<i>There is a vested interest in making developer tools as weighty and difficult (for the PITS) as possible .. why learn programming when you can just buy an app?</i><p>This is nonsense. You appear to be arguing that every computer user should be able to develop software - equivalent to arguing that every driver should be able to build a car.<p>You know why modern computers don&#x27;t ship with development tools? Because they are no longer used exclusively by people who are computer programmers. They&#x27;re mass-market devices now, and one of the requirements of that is that they need to allow users to perform tasks without learning how to develop software - an act that is totally orthogonal to actually performing those tasks.<p>Coupled with this, those people who <i>are</i> developers and require access to development tools have immediate access to them, thanks to the Internet. You can immediately download SDKs and IDEs for both Windows and MacOS, and every major Linux distribution comes bundled with a compiler. Same for Android, iPhones, etc. - it would be nothing but a waste to provide development tools when the vast majority of users do not require them, and when they are so easily available elsewhere.<p>I&#x27;m also completely unclear what &quot;fuss and nonsense required to just get a window up on the screen&quot; you think exists, given the ~10 lines of code which is required to do this on any platform.",1388332748

6979909,comment,6979277,6979277,2,0,yojo,,,"In my experience the times where I find I&#x27;ve done something that &quot;feels&quot; productive but isn&#x27;t (e.g. browsing projects on the internet, working on other things) are times where I feel stuck on my main task. This could be due to lack of clarity, or because there is a step that is boring/uninteresting/tedious.<p>The best advice I can give is that when you find yourself unwilling to do the work, break the work down into concrete, bite-sized steps. Then do the first one, then do the next one, and you&#x27;ll get it done. If you can&#x27;t do one of the steps because you&#x27;re blocked, figure out the steps to get unblocked, write those down, and do the first one.<p>The other thing I&#x27;ve found that helps is to set a clear schedule. The rhythm of the office helps get things done. I still wake up to an alarm at 8, I have a coffee at 10 and 2, and lunch is at noon. My wife comes home around 6, and I try to make sure I&#x27;m done at 6:30. I occasionally break all of these rules if I&#x27;m in the zone and really getting a lot done. If that happens, I give myself more time off later/the next day to ensure I&#x27;m always on a sustainable pace.<p>If you&#x27;re already stuck in a distraction quagmire, try to recognize it, and set an alarm for 30 minutes. When the alarm goes off, go back to work. If you still can&#x27;t work, go take a walk and try again.",1388332367

In particular, the concept of PSDrives, or filesystems which reside &quot;inside&quot; of a program and which the shell can connect to for standard hierarchical navigation and object/method execution.  This makes little sense for a system which strictly adheres to the Unix philosophy, ie., all programs perform one task and are so simple that the concept of a PSDrive would expose nothing that would provide benefit.  However, personal *nix, like Windows, now frequently run large GUI applications which would benefit by having their complexity exposed through a PSDrive.<p>Perhaps the open source community is currently working on something like PowerShell&#x27;s PSDrives, but adoption by the teams producing large apps would be critical to its success.<p>Anyway, the AREXX ports from the AmigaOS era are back again.

6979843,comment,6975278,6975519,3,0,nkoren,,,"Blender represents both the triumph and tragedy of open source software. I&#x27;ve been vaguely following its development since the late 90s, periodically making attempts to learn it, and failing until I finally made a more serious push earlier this month. Once one has gotten over the very steep learning curve, it&#x27;s an amazing piece of kit. On a feature-by-feature basis, it handily outcompetes many commercial packages, and once one has learned the keyboard shortcuts, I can see how the interface would actually become a pleasure for daily users.<p>However for beginners and casual users, the UI is a disaster: stupidly opaque and pointlessly obtuse. It is obtuse in ways which <i>aren&#x27;t</i> necessary to support the power-user workflow, but seem to exist for no other reason than to maximise the &quot;WTF?!?&quot; factor for new users.<p>For example: object-selection is done via a right-click, requiring the user to break their muscle-memory from literally every other GUI program they&#x27;ve ever used. WTF? And where are the contextual menus? And why are the all-important keyboard-shortcut tooltips scattered so haphazardly through the UI?<p>Making things worse, the defaults and documentation assume a three-button mouse and a full keyboard with a numeric keypad etc., and the most basic navigation functions -- panning, zooming, dollying, orbiting -- all rely on inputs from these devices. Working on my 13&quot; Macbook Pro, it took me about 15 hours of banging my head against the software until I found a combination of settings which allowed me to pan and zoom etc. using only my trackpad. (I had asked the Blender forums for help, and the advice I received was to buy another computer). Now it&#x27;s working quite well for me, but only because I was willing to endure a few days of pain to get there.<p>3D software doesn&#x27;t need to be this difficult. In my day, I&#x27;ve been highly proficient at 3D Studio, Lightwave, Cinema4D, Form•Z, and various other platforms, and none of them embody UX anti-conventions the way that Blender does. Heck, even basic things like its click-drag mechanics are just wrong (click-drag to initiate a drag, at which point the object or control point becomes &quot;sticky&quot; to the cursor, even after it&#x27;s released; a second click is required to end the drag), requiring the user to <i>comprehensively</i> retrain their muscle memory in order to use the software. WTF?!?<p>The Blender community, unfortunately, seems to largely be a self-selected cabal of people who have survived this pointless hazing ritual and are determined to make sure that everyone who follows in their footsteps does the same. Although a small minority of the community &quot;gets it&quot; and is making earnest and well-thought-through proposals about how to fix the situation (see: <a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ScPMbHv8WRCU2znB7IU2l-W9hH-NLs5weQKLkjqmgpA"" rel=""nofollow"">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ScPMbHv8WRCU2znB7IU2l-W9...</a>), they don&#x27;t seem to have much traction, and are continually derided / ignored by the rest of the community. Thus even the very simplest lowest-hanging fruit -- such as enabling &quot;select with left mouse button&quot; by default (it&#x27;s already an existing setting, buried deep in the preferences where no noob will ever find it) -- aren&#x27;t implemented.<p>It&#x27;s a sad situation, because with a bit more polish on the UI/UX, Blender could be a genuine player in the 3D industry, rather than an intriguingly powerful assemblage of missed opportunities.",1388331337

There are a lot of great tips here that detail how to organize your schedule tactically, but I&#x27;ll give you a little different insight on how to convince yourself to adjust and work a schedule that is better for you.<p>#1) Recognize that the reason you are looking at other projects is because you feel free or unleashed from your full-time job and now all of the creative restrictions that you had are now gone. So, this is you acting up because NOW you have the chance to do something that you want to do, even though you still are busy with this new remote gig. You are dreaming, which is great. This is normal, and from my experience almost never goes away.<p>#2) Recognize that the work you are getting paid for now is your #1 priority. Dreams come second.  You still have a boss, even if your boss is your friend. Anything you do outside of this work, your friend could care less. Do not lose insight of that.<p>#3) If you do start a new &quot;side&quot; project, make sure you finish it. I ran into many issues where I would start a new project, get people involved and then never finish it. It was by far the worst feeling I&#x27;ve ever had in my life.<p>#4) None of these tactical schedules that people mentioned below will work if you don&#x27;t know why you continue to do browse new projects or sit down and watch multiple seasons of sitcoms. This took me about 8 months to figure out, so you have some time to go :). What is your longterm goal? To make money enough money to live comfortable or to become Oprah successful?<p>#5) Get help right away. By help, I just mean other people that have been through a similar situation and that you can ask for honest feedback from. Obviously this HN post is a fantastic start. Find someone you can call up directly.<p>If you need more insight (or anyone else on this thread), my contact info is in my profile.",1388331240

Most of my peers in their twenties or thirties have strong values, but have a incredibly fatalistic/defeatist approach to reality. They are often very conscientious about their food, their (local and global) social and ecological environment, slavery, social injustice, and other issues.

You mentioned assistance while mentioning &quot;in isolation&quot; as the basis for my analysis which is the only point in which my analysis could possibly be valid. If you start introducing variables outside the discussion it makes it hard if not impossible to seriously discuss the impact of a policy change or some market force change. For instance we can see that in general as supply increases the price will drop <i>absent</i> other factors. There are tons of factors that could be introduced to make my minimum wage argument invalid. For instance if the market wage is never practically below $5 then a minimum wage of $3.60 is unlikely to have an outcome (unless something changes).<p>The argument against the minimum wage is in the realm of deductive reason and not something you look around for proof of or proof against. It&#x27;s basically the economics equivalent of 1+2=3. If there are problems with that equation we need to analyze it in its&#x27; space and not look around for cases when we think 1+2 != 3. The problem with verifying laws of economics is that we don&#x27;t know what we&#x27;re seeing the effects of in reality. Cultural, weather, moods, government policies, etc. could impact what we&#x27;re seeing in data without it being clear why or how. Empiricism can inform our analysis or can give us new routes to inquiry on but it can&#x27;t be used to argue for or against the laws of economics as we understand them.

High-status projects like OpenSSL or qmail will always have a sufficiently large community of researchers constantly combing over them, but the assumption of &quot;well, it&#x27;s open-source, so <i>someone</i> must have looked through it for security holes&quot; self-fails because everyone assumes someone else did the hard work and often no one does.<p>And if &quot;people looking through the code for exploits&quot; is the measure of a secure code-base, then Windows is the most secure platform ever.

6979712,comment,6979277,6979277,13,0,enobrev,,,"I&#x27;ve successfully worked from home as a developer since 2001, most of which was in a 450 square foot apartment with roommates in a very noisy part of Brooklyn.  Now I&#x27;m in a far more comfortable 2 bedroom with a view in Seattle with a separate bedroom as an office (and a door!), but my career was defined in that tiny shoebox of apartment.<p>First and foremost, boundaries are necessary.  This is both for you and for the people around you.  You don&#x27;t have to explicitly work 8 hours in a row every day, but whenever it is that you choose to work every day, disruptions should be completely closed off.<p>This means if you have roommates, they need to know that when you&#x27;re working, you&#x27;re not listening and impossible to distract.  For me, this has proven far more difficult with significant others who have lived with me.  I have lost a couple long term relationships with women who did not understand this, and the woman with whom I&#x27;m now engaged not only appreciates this this very important invisible wall, but helps me maintain it.<p>Same goes for other outside distractions.  It would be weird if your friends dropped into your 9-5 job and sat on the couch, cracked a beer and started playing video games, or if they called your office line every 20 minutes to try to convince you to head out for whatever might be going on.  This same limitation needs to be set at your home.  If necessary, maintain a separate lines of communication between work and personal life (phone, IM, skype, email, etc) to make sure that while you&#x27;re working, you can concentrate on only communicating with work associates, and the opposite is just as important - when you&#x27;re enjoying your life, leave work to your office space.<p>And if your home office is in a distracting neighborhood (as mine very much was when I was living in Brooklyn), turn some music on, wear some headphones, find a coffee shop, or rent some office space somewhere quieter.  Depending on where you are, it&#x27;s not difficult to find a company that happens to have an extra desk or two and is willing to rent one out at a fair price.<p>Give yourself a great office space that you look forward to spending your days in.  Mine was a corner of a room that was sometimes also a bedroom and sometimes also a living room.  But it was the most well kept at all times.  Three monitors, a quiet and fast computer, a comfortable chair, interesting art on my wall, a great keyboard and mouse, a relatively clean desk, a decent coffee maker, great stereo system, studio-quality headphones, high speed expensive internet, and a giant roll of paper with some markers that I could brainstorm or play with whenever necessary.<p>I&#x27;ve read some other great responses here about exercise, and eating right and so on.  I agree with all of the above, but I didn&#x27;t bother with such things until the past 5 years.  I never exercised, I worked stupidly long hours (occasionally 36 hour days), I ate crap, I partied at all hours, and I&#x27;d never set a schedule.  I began changing a lot of that in the past five years or so.  I now limit myself to 16 hours in a day (but usually keep my limit to 8) and I exercise more and I eat better.  But I do those things because I turned 30 and realized 9 years of random debauchery and no exercise do not do much for ones health and figure.  I&#x27;d be a liar if I told you I did that during the most crucially defining portion of my remote career.<p>As for the Real Motivation.  All of the above and all the advice in this thread, and all the advice I&#x27;ve read elsewhere (and mostly ignored) about remote working have no competition with this one single point.  What has motivated me more than anything in the world:  Challenging Work at High wages.  I always needed at least one of the two or the project would definitely fail, but having both ensured that I&#x27;d always find the time, energy, and space to get the work done well, efficiently, with great communication.  The office space didn&#x27;t matter.  The noise didn&#x27;t matter.  The schedule _Definitely_ didn&#x27;t matter.  I was unstoppable provided I had Work that I couldn&#x27;t possibly tear myself away from and a sizable check at the starting and finish lines to help keep my life in order.<p>Good luck.",1388329396

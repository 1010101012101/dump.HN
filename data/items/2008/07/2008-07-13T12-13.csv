245081,comment,245033,245033,0,0,chris_l,,,"This is spot on, I've wondered about the economics of scarcity for a while. How does it apply to selling accounts for a hot web service? Maybe give them away for free while you're obscure, grant invitation privileges to the early adopters and start charging when the mass of users rolls in. Bonus points for raising the price, the more well-known you become. Can you share your success with the early adopters? Maybe allow them to sell their contingent of free accounts somehow?",1215953310

Well, old posts that have merit ought to be reposted. But old posts of little value? Why are we upmodding this? So that we can all agree that Eric is wrong about hackers in a self-congratulatory fit of back slapping and strutting?<p>Either way, I agree that this is another sign that HN is changing character. I am not prepared to say it is changing in a bad way, or that the site has no value, or that there is going to be an exodus.<p>But I agree that there is a change going on.",1215951754

That maybe true for USA, UK, Canada and countries like that. Maybe 1-2% (or even lesser) for other countries in Asia-Pacific region. And maybe the same for european countries like France, Germany, etc.<p>Basically, I just mean that it all depends on the mindset of the people of those countries about ecommerce in general. So people in regions like Asia-Pacific will get only ""Happy Birthday"" wall post.  :)",1215951547

It strikes me that this license more than any other protects the rights of programmers and enables them to earn a living. This might seem counterintuitive, and it certainly is counter to the propaganda that often spread about communism and programmers earning a living, but much of that stems from the way corporations are structured as legal entities.",1215951049

You've no control over this leg. From there the token travels through the network operator's network, to a switch, and then over the GSM network to the handset.<p>There are at <i>least</i> two places there where you can launch a man in the middle attack.<p>Which brings me back to the threat model - understanding the value of the asset you're protecting will tell you whether the cost [1] of such an authentication scheme is worth it.

It provides both the semicircular version and a sine-wave version. The paper does some mathematical analysis on the sine wave version, and putatively comes up with a way to transform the series of sine waves for a Sieve of Eratosthenes of a finite size into a single function that is close to zero for composites and significantly non-zero for primes.<p>I assumed on first sight of the visualization that the semicircles were standing in for sine waves, and I was right. I assumed that semicircles were used because they are easier to draw, or because it's easier to see the Sieve of Eratosthenes in it, or that it was necessary to make this adjustment in order to perform well. Or maybe just that it was prettier. But it was clearly alluding to sine waves. Looking at the paper demonstrates that I was correct on this assumption.<p>By the way, you do know that any periodic function can be expressed as a sum of sine waves, don't you? Even a wave form made out of repeating semicircles. What I didn't know before this is that Fourier transforms are used in number theory, and now I know, thanks to this visualization. And best of all, this visualization let me intuit that fact on my own. I can't imagine a visualization that could provide anything better than that!",1342650309

The toughest for me was sticking with Mathematics, because apart from trig, relational algebra, and discreet maths I hardly ever have a chance to apply the rest.

For me, after a year long period where I read into philosophy in depth I pretty much decided the whole field was pointless (for me), and decided to concentrate on disciplines that were more applicable and enjoyable for me such as physics and political history.<p>Lastly, to quickly answer your question about which subjects to learn I'd say the following a good for getting an overall understanding (and will keep you more than busy for quite a while :)<p>1. The world of the abstract - Math<p>2. Understanding the universe and our relationship to it - Physics<p>3. Life and living organisms - Biology and evolutionary theory (Dawkins, Dennett )<p>4.

Because it's easy to digest and easy to transmit, they get spread very easily by the general population, even though they don't make sense.<p>""Eat fat, and your body turns that into fat.  If you want to lose weight, then stop eating fat.""<p>The funny thing is how violently people react when you explain to them that those theories are possibly wrong.  My friend is ""trying"" to lose weight by cutting out the fat.  When I tell her that she needs to cut carbs instead, she gets almost offended, and says that it doesn't work.  Meanwhile, I lost 20 lbs in 5 months while on an aggressive South Beach diet (less than 100 g of carbs per day) and my cholesterol was extremely low.<p>When you look into the actual biochemistry of it, it really looks like the pathways that Atkins/South Beach diet talk about with respect to carbohydrates and blood sugar are the real culprits.  The food we eat today is highly processed, and creates an over-balance of blood sugar, and that is the cause of why so many Americans are fat.<p>The food industry has found cheaper and more predictable ways of making our food (process the carbohydates into a fine powder, so that it's uniform and easy to cook with), but the side effect of this is that it causes our blood sugar to skyrocket and makes us fat because we are mostly sedentary (myself included).<p>The funny thing is that even the theories on cholesterol are coming into question.  The absolute values of HDL/LDL may not be important, but some people are saying it's the ratio of HDL to LDL that matters.

But the vaccines were introduced anyway so  you could say it was the vaccines that did it but other factors were at hand.<p>Sometimes I think correlation not only doesn't equal causation, but counters causation, like a son doing well not because of his overbearing mother, but in spite of it. (She would claim the credit anyhow.) - I've read about vaccines causing diseases they are proclaimed to guard against - ""weaponized vaccines.""",1342648838

I love how simple it is to setup simple transitions and ""play"" the app.<p>Dragging a page into the trashcan is inconsistent with deleting an element by hitting the trashcan button; it took me a bit of frustration to figure out. There's no way to figure out what the buttons do short of clicking on them to figure it out. Most features are intuitive but as evidenced by the ""Actually it looks to me like it's only for iPhone design."" comment the UI could use a little more explanation (there's no rule against using an icon /and/ text for menu options).<p>I really don't understand why there are so many negative comments, this is very nicely done and I can see it being useful. I'll definitely give using it a shot on my next mobile project.",1342648801

10215702,comment,10215085,10215462,0,0,jerf,,,"A lot of social mechanisms are quite counterintuitive. One example I like to point out is that the purpose of voting is not to determine the winner, but to determine the loser. The winner already knows they won. Problem is, the loser also knows that they won. Voting is brilliant for creating a non-violent mechanism for convincing losers to go away while feeling like they have a chance next time. That&#x27;s why voting corruption is so dangerous... the problem is less &quot;the wrong thing winning&quot; and more &quot;society breaks down, the losers stop trusting the ballot box and start trusting their guns&quot;. People ought to be a lot angrier about voting corruption, even if they think it corrupted it on to &quot;their side&quot;, then they actually are. (This is also why high voting rates are important. It&#x27;s not about whether you tipped the balance between the two options, it&#x27;s whether you are bought in to the result being fair, at scale. Low participations leaves rationalizations available to the losers. It really is a civil duty, even if the immediate payoff seems low.)<p>Similarly, police protect the citizenry, right? Well, yes, but the citizenry unless actively prevented will work out ways of protecting themselves. The notable difference with a formal police and court system is that we still treat <i>criminals</i> with respect. Allowing the police and courts to breakdown is, in the final stable societal state, more dangerous for criminals and anyone perceived to be criminals, ultimately potentially degenerating into outright tribalism (usually called gangs in this context) that simply equates &quot;outsider&quot; and &quot;danger&quot;.<p>People really underestimate the importance of these social mechanisms, and corrupt them at more peril than they realize for their own petty short-term gains.",1442246373

    // ...
    obj->OBJ::~OBJ(); // OBJ was the template type

acquire() could be improved by using placement new and forwarding the constructor arguments via variadic template:<p><pre><code>  template<typename... T>

    return new(mem) OBJ (args...);

  class Pool {
    struct MockOBJ {
      uint8_t data[sizeof(OBJ)];

It happens even when writing real code into a real editor/IDE, and especially when dealing with code that has lots of repetition (as advocated by Galanwe).

10215642,comment,10214779,10215338,0,0,jules,,,"There isn&#x27;t anything missing, on the contrary, there&#x27;s too much so that the things that people actually care about are not easy. Nobody cares about an &quot;ecosystem of applications&quot;, or &quot;out of classroom experience&quot;. Put yourself in the mind of the student. What are their top questions?<p>1. What homework is due?<p>2. When and where are my lectures?<p>3. What was taught or will be taught in some specific lecture?<p>4. What do I need to study for my exam?<p>5. At the start of the semester: Which courses are available, and info about each course (topic, teacher, book, etc.)<p>Now, the promo video doesn&#x27;t show very much, but let&#x27;s see how you would find out about homework in current Blackboard. I need to log in (it doesn&#x27;t keep you logged in). Then I click on &quot;courses&quot;. Then for each course I need to click on that course and browse the course&#x27;s pages to find out if homework is mentioned somewhere. And of course because the professors find blackboard terrible too, most of them put the homework on their personal webpages instead, so not even half of the info is there. All in all it&#x27;s about 100 clicks to find out the answer to question (1). Maybe the professors are just putting the info in the wrong place which makes it hard for the students to find, but this also counts as a failure of Blackboard.<p>What should you do instead. Keep people logged in. The main page right after logging in should be a full page calendar with the schedule of lectures, exams, and homework due. Then for each course there should be ONE page. Current blackboard has zillions of pages per course, but 99% are empty and the info related to one course easily fits on one page so you don&#x27;t need to hunt among the empty pages for the info you need. The professors who have the course page on their personal website always use one page, and it&#x27;s <i>much</i> more usable. On the page of a course there should be general info, and info for each lecture (but not on a separate page per lecture!). The lectures in the calendar should link to the per lecture info, which is on that one page per course, scrolled down.<p>This way question (1) and question (2) can be answered by one glance at the calendar homepage. Question (3), (4) and (5) can be answered by clicking on a lecture in the calendar, i.e. one click away from the homepage.<p>Now for a very important point: let the students edit this info! If some professor does not use blackboard or uses it badly, make sure the students do. Let them put up a page for the course, enter the lecture schedule in the calendar, mark when homework is due, etc. Blackboard is much more useful if <i>all</i> info is there. Of course you get nightmares about letting students edit this, but trust me it will be good. If wikipedia can let anonymous people all around the world edit it, blackboard can let non-anonymous students of a particular course edit it.<p>The real problem of course is that Blackboard isn&#x27;t built for students, and isn&#x27;t built for teachers. It&#x27;s built for the people who make the decision to buy Blackboard. That&#x27;s why Blackboard will die like a fly to a competitor that does get this right. They will provide all this for free, initially, and students and teachers will use it out of their free will, and Blackboard will be even more empty than it already is. If you&#x27;re losing 70% teachers who put info on their personal homepage, and are willing to learn HTML to avoid having to use Blackboard (!), imagine what a halfway decent competitor that isn&#x27;t &quot;code your own website in HTML&quot; could do.",1442245700

It can collect and use a running average of pings to/from all clients which it can then use to order events (ie. did I do X before you did Y?). But that&#x27;s where the really hard (and fun!) coding and choices start, such as for example future prediction and unrolling of actions.<p>Roughly speaking, for prediction (to lessen the effect of perceived lag), the server could predict that I was moving forward up to the last packet received, so I&#x27;m <i>probably</i> still going to be moving forward. It can then use the predicted values in all calculations until it receives an actual packet informing it what actually happened (at which point it will need to decide how to handle possibly conflicting information, which is handled the same as below).<p>For unrolling, if you have for example a 50ms ping and I 100ms; then at T+51ms you tell the server that you killed me, but I do the same at T+100ms - effectively compensating for the 50ms of lag difference between us you should die since I killed you 1ms before you killed me. BUT now it really depends on the server choices, do you kill me because your message got there first (old-school FPS); or does the server wait for my info since I&#x27;m involved in the action and then retroactively adjust you? Worse, since the server only gets my info on T+100 you will at best only get it at T+150, meaning that you will perceive 99ms of being alive (and maybe during which you killed someone else) which the server will then have to discard before killing you (some modern FPS use this scheme, you&#x27;ll notice it where you peek out around a corner from safety and then go back, before suddenly being dead from an impossible shot). Also tough is the fact that it&#x27;s not a single unroll, during the extra 99ms of being alive you would have still been sending packets to the server which then all have to be unrolled.",1442245407

The lowest status tier requires 25,000 qualifying miles.<p>The Delta &quot;Reserve&quot; card will convert 15,000 miles to qualifying at $30,000 spent, and another 15,000 miles at $60,000 spent. The lowest status tier requires 25,000 qualifying miles.<p>The only other non-flying method of earning qualifying miles that I&#x27;ve seen in this decade was an occasional promotion US Airways would run, offering 5,000 qualifying miles for buying or renewing a lounge membership. It was not offered last year, and probably will not be offered this year.<p>Note that airlines will occasionally allow you to buy your way up to the next status tier if you&#x27;re within a certain range, but that typically doesn&#x27;t actually deposit miles into your account: you just pay the fee, get the higher status, and that&#x27;s that. Last year, American Airlines offered a flat-rate buy-up if you were within 15,000 miles or 15 segments of the next tier, for example, so at 85,000 qualifying miles you could have paid a couple thousand dollars to buy up to Executive Platinum status.",1442245142

This was before even asking the girl and her parents if they wanted to press charges, and when school sanctions would have been enough without getting the police involved and charging the boy with assault. These kinds of things happen when you make the definition of harassment too broad, you end up with a punishment that does not fit the crime.

Ones that matter to me: priority boarding is great on busy routes, because it means there will definitely be room for your carry-on luggage.

One thing I did with them really saved our hash at my last company multiple times:<p>Our infrastructure daemons were written in Python, and I wanted to make sure we had a debuggable system that allows me to trace any error without having to manually reproduce it (especially when, say, problems specific to a customer&#x27;s network can&#x27;t be reproduced on ours). I wrote a decorator, called @logme, that would log a function&#x27;s name and parameters plus the module it belonged to (easier said than done!), run the function, then log and return the return value. Every function was decorated with @logme. I also made a variant for methods called @logmethod that would also log data about the class the method belonged to.<p>Now, obviously, this generated massive amounts of logs, so I put in a healthy amount of log rotation (the Python logger is <i>beautifully</i> customizable). On average, logs would keep for a few days.<p>So many times, I debugged customer problems -- problems that would&#x27;ve been impossible to reproduce in our lab because of edge cases our customers encountered -- just from the incredibly detailed logs they&#x27;d send me.<p>Also, it was imperative that the main infrastructure daemon never, ever crashes. It sat and waited for commands to be sent to it. When it finishes executing one command, it goes back to listening. If it got an error running some command, it should report that error and then go back to listening for the next command; an error running an individual command should <i>never</i> bring down the system. The decorators took care of that too. In addition to logging what goes into and out of every function, @logme and @logmethod also caught any exception those functions raised and logged them, allowing the system to recover following any exception just by decorating everything (I would <i>not</i> recommend this for a more stateful system: it only worked as well as it did because any configuration needed was always loaded from disk when each command was run, so the daemon overall had no state that could be corrupted by an error).",1442244642

If you are willing to commit to the size of your string at compile time, you have the option to use char[N] instead, avoiding heap allocations. Or you can use a stack-based allocator for std::string.<p>The thing about templates is misleading. Sure, if misused they can hurt your cache. But they also move branching from run time to compile time, which is a very good thing. Google some benchmarks of C++ sort vs C qsort; the former is much faster because the comparator can easily be inlined.<p>The templates used in my post, for example, either bloat the code not at all, or very little. They are either generating tiny functions that get inlined anyway (like ArrayView; once a function is inlined its irrelevant whether it came from a template or not for code bloat purposes) or they are generating code that would just need to be written by hand (like make_contiguous).<p>I&#x27;ve actually personally witnessed two fairly detailed accounts of people that actually got themselves into situations where template or template-like bloat became a performance negative, relative to the benefits they provided. They didn&#x27;t cite a cliche about code bloat, they actually benchmarked and found the cost. What both of them were doing was very extreme; nobody who&#x27;s not using very extreme template techniques (and therefore is sold on it) is hitting that point.",1442244417

First of all, nature is not random, but there is a lack of understanding of the true implications of cause and effect of what goes on at a biological (and ecological) level that it may appear that way to people so captivated by the binary control of the programming world.<p>But, even if it were random, I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s evil in the least. It&#x27;s unpredictable, yes, but so are the implications of many of the technologies that Thiel embraces. That does not make those technologies inherently evil, just as &quot;randomness&quot; is not an evil part of nature.<p>I am afraid of the sterile world that Thiel seems to want.<p>Additionally, I&#x27;d like to point out this bit from a below comment where the poster responded to several article excerpts, including: &quot;I think of aging and maybe just mortality as random things that go wrong. The older you get, the more random things happen, the more breaks. If it’s not cancer, you could get hit by an asteroid. So on some level, technology is trying to overcome the randomness that is nature. That is a question on the level of a company. Can you get rid of randomness in building a company? But the philosophical version of the question is whether we can get rid of randomness in its entirety and overcome the randomness that I think of as the evil part of nature.&quot;
Nature isn&#x27;t random! Nature is complex, cryptic, self-referential, and chaotic, but it&#x27;s deterministic at the level of biology. &quot;Random things happening&quot; is not a proper understanding of age-related decline; aging is the long-term compounding interest of metabolic byproducts.

(E.g. an @skip(&#x27;not yet implemented&#x27;) test decorator.) Or they could call it multiple times. The post-decoration function doesn&#x27;t even need to be a function[1]. And that doesn&#x27;t touch on decorated classes, either.<p>I find them easiest to understand using the source-rewriting explanation:<p><pre><code>    @foo
    def bar(...):
       ...
</code></pre>
is the same as<p><pre><code>    def bar(...):
       ...

    bar = foo(bar)
</code></pre>
Classes can be decorated in the same way. This also explains why decorators taking arguments work how they do: because<p><pre><code>    @foo(...)
</code></pre>
turns into<p><pre><code>    bar = foo(...)(bar)
</code></pre>
and thus foo needs to <i>return</i> a decorator, not <i>be</i> a decorator. (Where a decorator can be thought of as &quot;any function that accepts a single argument&quot;, or as &quot;any function which happens to be useful as a decorator&quot;, or whatever.)<p>But explaining them like this doesn&#x27;t make it obvious what they&#x27;re <i>for</i>. (I can worry about that later, but others find it easier to understand things given a motivating example.) And some people haven&#x27;t got their heads around first-class functions yet. So while this would be my preferred explanation if I was talking to a version of me who didn&#x27;t know decorators yet, it&#x27;s not the best for everyone.<p>[1] This hasn&#x27;t previously occurred to me, and I&#x27;ve never seen it explored, but I just verified that it works:<p><pre><code>    def const(fun):
        return fun()

    @const
    def bar():
        return 3

    print 3 * bar # 9

As in this case.<p>> What he did is very precisely parasitical.<p>Nope:<p>> par·a·site; an organism that lives in or on another organism (its host) and benefits by deriving nutrients at the host&#x27;s expense.<p>Nothing precise about it. More like a slang insult for behaviour you disapprove of.<p>> If it&#x27;s wrong for Avis to be an amoral, predatory agent that focuses only on what they get without regard to the costs, then it is equally bad for this person to do the same.<p>But when companies do it everyone ignores it, or screams &quot;buyer beware.&quot; When an individual does it people start name calling, villifying, or using moralist arguments. It is a double standard. When Avis does it it is Avis&#x27; customer&#x27;s fault, when a customer does it to Avis, it is still the customer&#x27;s fault.<p>> In one way it&#x27;s worse: he knows he&#x27;s being exploitative, where a lot of large-organization negative externality is due to clueless systems, not conscious individual choice.<p>You&#x27;re now literally playing the &quot;Avis is amoral so it is ok&quot; card. Why is it inherently wrong for individuals to act amoral towards an entity which also acts amoral?<p>> Approving of it because you don&#x27;t like Avis and identify with this guy makes the problem worse.<p>For the record, I approve of it because Avis would do exactly the same thing in his place, and does to their customers all of the time. I think Avis should be treated the way they treat others. It isn&#x27;t because I dislike Avis, it is because I like to see equal treatment, and if Avis is treating people badly then they too deserve to be treated just as well (or not).<p>If companies are flexible or show loyalty, I genuinely believe customers return that in kind. Look at Costco. This is not one of those companies.<p>> Because now you&#x27;ve helped normalize exploitation as a behavior, and people inside Avis will feel just as justified in their bad behavior because they can see themselves as responding to &quot;those awful scamming customers&quot;.<p>Companies have already normalised the behaviour. So much so that we don&#x27;t even talk about it anymore. In fact we teach kids that companies will try and exploit them if allowed, or take advantage of them, and then teach them a bunch of tricks to look out for when booking or buying (e.g. resort fees, baggage fees, location fees, un-included taxes, et al).<p>It is laughable to suggest that this guy treating Avis just once like Avis treats their customers daily and for many years, has somehow caused Avis to act this way. You&#x27;re clearly applying one set of standards to companies and a completely different set to individuals (i.e. effectively companies are beyond repute in your mental model, but individuals deserve your disdain for being as bad as companies even if occasionally).",1442243036

Cars are the second most expensive capital asset most people have after their house. They sit idle, depreciating, taking up valuable land 95% of the time on average. A self-driving car is very complementary to services like Uber. If self-driving cars could be shared, increasing vehicle utilization past 5%, then we could repurpose vast swaths of unproductive urban land.<p>Once fewer people are owning cars, and instead paying a la carte, it also restructures the choice architecture of driving.

Fundamentally, the results are rarely good when someone is buying software on behalf of someone else unless they have a deep understanding of how the other group works and where they spend the most time. One really common manifestation of this problem is when senior managers buy the software which gives them the reports which they want but doesn&#x27;t consider how painful the process of entering the data is or whether the system design biases that data.<p>Enterprise software exacerbates that problem because the business model is a one-time decision to make a very expensive purchase. Since correcting a mistake is hard-to-impossible, that tends to lead to “requirements” which include everything anyone has ever thought they might need, which favors the really large vendors who can afford to check most of those boxes and promise that their expensive consultants can customize the software after the fact to get the remaining ones, which has a near-certainty of resulting in the problem mentioned where someone implemented just enough to say they satisfied a requirement but will never improve it before the next round unless you cough up more money and since it&#x27;s customized per-customer there&#x27;s limited ability to get improvements which someone else paid for.",1442242917

I think it&#x27;s pretty clear which is least readable and least concise.<p>So, what does XML buy one in exchange for its lack of concision?  Well, a pre-processing tool which knows nothing about WebDAV or CalDAV could use a schema definition to sanity-check the formatting of a query.  It could probably be set up to detect if one used an invalid date format; it may or may not be configurable to detect if one searched for a VCALENDAR component inside a VEVENT. Regardless, there are semantic constraints in a data model which cannot be expressed with, e.g., a DTD or XSD.<p>How about JSON?  What does it buy? Well, it has built-in hash tables (as opposed to faking them with (table (key val) (key2 val2))), which is a huge win, and it has a ton of libraries in every language one can imagine.<p>How about S-expressions? I think that they win on clarity, readability and concision. But there are not a ton of parsing libraries available for every language (OTOH, a canonical-S-expression parser can be written in a few hours for any language).<p>So, who wins? I think that for most projects nowadays, JSON&#x27;s clearly the answer.  The pain of XML simply doesn&#x27;t pay off in practice, while the elegance of S-expressions doesn&#x27;t outweigh the unfamiliarity of the great mass of enterprise software developers.<p>But if you have a choice, use S-expressions.",1442242892

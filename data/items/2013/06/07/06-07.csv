5837651,comment,5837253,5837582,8,0,anigbrowl,,,"I have read it, twice. Also, I'm not the same person who critiqued the Atlantic in the first place.<p>Here are my objections to his position:<p>1. Schneier is calling for people to break the law at great risk to themselves on the ground that the government's current position is immoral (but not illegal).<p>2. While saying that it's scary what we don't know, he makes no effort to educate his audience on what we do know, such as how this sort of activity comes to be legal and constitutional in the first place, the answers to which lie in the 1970s (see my other comments on Smith v. Maryland today, for example).<p>3. Schneier has absolutely nothing to say on how this state of affairs might be fixed, or what it is that US citizens should demand of their senators and state representatives to repair the situation through democratic means. My answer to that question is that that we need a constitutional amendment that creates an explicit right to privacy and another that narrows the power of Congress to abdicate its oversight of the Executive branch, which latter is conveniently required to maximize its defensive capabilities. I also think it's high time that the AUMF was rescinded.<p>4. Schneier has made a fine career out of complaining about the security state but shows no leadership when it comes to rolling it back. We all hate the TSA's instrusive searches and silly rules, yes? But when the TSA proposed loosening the restrictions on what you could take onto a plane, to allow practical exceptions like small pocketknives and so on, airlines lobbied heavily against it on behalf of their staff (who, in fairness, would be facing an elevated risk). Despite years of complaining about the TSA, Schneier did not AFAIK write <i>anything</i> about the proposed changes, let alone express support or encourage others to do so. Although the proposed rule change was pretty small, it would have represented at least a minor victory for common sense instead of security theater. But when it was offered up from public debate, Schneier didn't even consider it worth mentioning to his readers.<p>Schneier's great at stoking readers' outrage - not so good at educating them or helping them channel it effectively. In my view, his punditry is emotional rather than analytical.",1370588326

5837649,comment,5837253,5837253,16,0,kijin,,,"> <i>The U.S. government is on a secrecy binge ... We need whistle-blowers.</i><p>Q: What's the difference between the kind of transparency that Wikileaks et al. tries to promote, and the kind of transparency that Mark Zuckerberg wants Facebook users to adopt?<p>A: The former asks transparency of powerful entities, helping to check their power. The latter asks transparency of relatively powerless individuals, enabling the modern surveillance state and making individuals even more powerless.<p>The most important thing that we should keep in mind when we talk about any sort of justice in the context of information is how possession of information alters the balance of power in the world. Because politics, ultimately, boils down to who has how much power over whom. It's not about embarrassment. It's all about the loss of authority that public scrutiny and embarrassment can cause.<p>""Knowledge is power"": knowing something about somebody gives you power over that somebody. This rule of thumb even works when we interact with physical objects (if you know how something works, you have the power to use it to your advantage), and it works just as well when we interact with other people. Asymmetric transparency leads to asymmetric power because they know enough about you to take advantage of you but you don't know enough about them to take advantage of them.<p>This is why I firmly believe that powerful entities should be required to be several orders of magnitude more transparent, and therefore open to public scrutiny, than the average chump would ever need to be. The only thing that can balance off the asymmetry of power that complex social organization usually entails is an asymmetry of knowledge in the other direction. Example: Who I talked with on the phone last night is none of your fucking business. But if you're in a position of considerable power, every meeting you ever have with every lobbyist in the Universe should be damn well everyone's business. This is not unfair at all. Clinton had no right to get secret blowjobs in my opinion. Nobody should be allowed to have both power and privacy, because the combination is a recipe for tyranny.",1370588271

The most vocal market participants against HFT are usually large, institutional market makers who used to grow fat on $1/16 spreads and liquidity rebates (Themis, I'm looking in your direction). These guys used to not have to work particularly hard for the cash, but they're getting their lunches eaten by new market participants who can do it faster and cheaper and have built their companies around integrating new tech very rapidly.<p>You'll find people trotting out the same old chestnuts (brain drain, unfairness of server colocation, etc.) but those are distractions from the interesting issues.<p>As an aside, I once had the distinct pleasure of watching a conversation on one of the CNBC programs running in our kitchen in which a NYSE floor trader actually used the phrase ""we're the institutional investor looking out for the little guy"" while managing to keep a straight face. This dude probably would have curb stomped his own grandmother to pick up a $100 bill. Even the usually sympathetic hosts just laughed outright.<p>I'm surprised that the outrage against HFT is so strong given how comparatively little is at stake there. After the HFT's much, much, <i>much</i> larger financial cousins, the ""big bank"" market participants nearly destroyed the entire planet's financial system, it's quite a coup for them that they've shifted the outrage to the guys competing over less money than some banks pay out in bonuses.<p>I have no love for anyone in the financial industry (I'm a self-loather, if you haven't noticed), but the HFT guys are way, way further down on my list of people to be pissed off at.",1370585417

He adds: ""Your bag may be traveling for several miles"" in this maze, and watching it at every step along the way just isnt feasible.</i><p>That's a ridiculous excuse. The police, FBI, or whatever law enforcement agency could put hidden cameras and microphones in various luggage--packed with expensive things that are worth stealing--as part of a sting operation. If there's a serious problem (keeping in mind that the <i>average</i> loss is 0.5%), then they'd be able to nab the crooked TSA agents or baggage handlers after just a couple dozen runs.<p>The reason this is not done is because this is <i>boring</i> to police. It is not a glamorous or interesting kind of crime to solve, and nor does it make money like speeding tickets or parking tickets.",1345060776

Nevermind how difficult it must feel to try to fit in as a minority group at a conference only to find yourself sexually harassed  by a stranger.<p>Appreciate how privileged you are when your worry isn't ""i hope some random man doesn't try to grab my ass"" but instead ""how am i supposed to know if this random woman wants me to grab her ass?"". Is it really that difficult to be a guy? Is the line of sexual harassment (especially in the context of the articles examples) really that hard to figure out?",1345060755

I'm not saying the levels of scum are acceptable, just that there is a disparity in which encounters get shared.<p>We know that people have reported their first hand accounts of receiving harassment at multiple cons and multiple times per con. These incidents are not isolated. There is a strong chance that if you are a woman and you attend hacker conferences you will be harassed at least once. Computer circles at large have a problem with sexism and as an overall community does not disapprove of sexist behavior, attitudes, and actions.<p>Other people may not experience harassment at conventions. That is their experience and that is legit. However, that does not in any way negate other people's experience of harassment at those venues nor does it excuse those incidents.

Seems like a very interesting problem algorithmically.<p>Even small incentives can have dramatic effects  look at the number of under-employed who recycle aluminum cans for 5-10/pop. It's by far the most cost-effective way to increase the rate of recycling. There are certainly quite a number of people willing to move bicycles a couple miles for $1-2. I know I'm beating the HN dead horse here, but markets do tend to be efficient at allocating resources when the basic costs are set correctly.<p>With your mobile app, you have the advantage that you know not only where a bike was picked up, but how far the customer had to travel to reach it. With so much data at your disposal, you should be able to get a pretty good predictive handle on the ebb and flow of demand in the system.<p>It'll be cool when I can subscribe to a higher tier to have my demand weighted more heavily. ;)",1345060456

Then you modify it, and check it in again. Repeat 8 more times.<p>In git with and without git-annex, you can check out the repository at any time and end up with the local files from that checkout.<p>In normal git, your local repository is now a gigabyte (the encryption in this hypothetical file prevents git from being able to delta-compress; in reality git would likely be able to compress it somewhat, but it still may be hundreds of megabytes).<p>With git-annex, all the previous copies are stored on the SERVER, but not in git itself. Even if you don't care about local hard drive space since hard drives are cheap, consider that if I then clone your repository, I would only need to download 100Mb instead of 1Gb. The downside, of course, is that you need to be connected to the server to get historical versions of a particular file.<p>When you're dealing with, say, a game project with 20Gb of binary data that's been versioned 20x on average, you end up with 400Gb to clone your art repository, which is a non-trivial download size. And if, for some reason, you want your repository cloned to multiple folders on your drive, then again you're using 10Gb each instead of 400Gb each. Even on cheap hard drives, multiple folders of 400Gb each adds up quickly.<p>EDIT: OH, and one other advantage of doing it this way: If you just use rsync, and you accidentally overwrite a file and don't notice for a day or two, rsync will happily destroy your backup file as well, while git-annex will just store a new revision.

At some point, the quality difference between the encoded version and the source video becomes negligible, so it's natural to expect that better compression would result in smaller file sizes for any given raw source.<p>The time when this doesn't apply is when you're currently losing a noticeable about of video quality to keep file sizes down. Say that you're a movie streaming service, and you want to stream a fairly new movie. You have it at very high resolution, but if you wanted to stream it at Blu-Ray quality, that would really eat up your bandwidth, so you decrease the file size to something you're comfortable with, and get as much quality as you can within those limits. Better compression, in that case, would mean either better quality at the same file size, or bandwidth savings at the same quality, or some combination of the two.<p>So: I would expect this to make pirated TV rips smaller, pirated Blu-Ray rips larger or smaller (depending on what the encoding is optimized for), and streaming video either higher quality or smaller, depending on your connection speed and how much bandwidth they're willing to pay for.",1345059316

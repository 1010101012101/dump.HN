In doing that, I saw a lot of what you saw with regards to terrible and weird presentations, but I also saw some groups that looked like they had a ton of promise but were <i>terrible</i> and communicating the point.<p>That being said, you may want to consider also providing services to some of the smaller funds out there as a bullshit detector.

There are very few industries more arrogant and abusive than the telcos (at least in the US; I dunno about the UK), and if Google wants to take their place, I'm all for it.  Instead of playing the consumer-screwing game better (like Apple did with the iPhone and its subsidized/locked-in model) Google is leaving those decisions up to the consumer and giving them a fair deal all around.<p>My impression is that Google looked at the existing phones and the way they were being sold (exclusive to specific carriers, and used to lock consumers in, just like all prior phones) and felt that it just wasn't doing the job the way they'd planned.  Android had a reason for existing, and it was to break the logjam in the mobile industry so that Google could get on with the business of monetizing the hell out of mobile users.  Since the old players decided to use Android to play by the old rules, Google simply reminded them of the way ""open"" is supposed to work.  The play here is not for Google to become a traditional mobile device provider or to become a mobile service provider (though they'll touch on both).  The play is to make the mobile web standard enough and good enough and pervasive enough to where Google can work their money-making magic there.  Telcos are standing (aggressively) in the way of that, and the device makers remain willing partners in those plans.",1263304532

As an almost Atheist (lacking the needed faith to really be one) I find the Quram mildly disturbing (as I do with other sacred texts, the Bible included) in that it proposes to be the absolute truth that admits no questioning. I respect, however, your right to your faith. You may believe in whatever you like, and I will defend your right to it against those who may want to take it away from you. But, in return for my respect, I demand from you the same respect. If I believe the cartoons are funny and worthy of publication, I demand you respect my right to draw, discuss or even (if the authors so agree) to reproduce them. By hiding behind the ""biggest and dumbest asshole"" metaphor, you excuse yourself, and the intolerant people who find it right to kill authors for offending their faith, from the obligation to respect others. Muslims are not the dumbest and obviously can learn to live in societies that don't share religiously intolerant laws.<p>Some of the cartoons were funny. I had a couple good laughs out of them. Would I be offended if they were about Christ (I was raised a Catholic)? No way. Would I be offended if they had been about scientists (I am an almost-Atheist)? Of course not. They are cartoons, meant to be funny and to, sometimes, question beliefs.<p>If your faith cannot withstand questioning then, perhaps, you should question yourself how deep and true it really is.",1263304288

It's offensive and distasteful, and the author should have kept in mind that insulting 1 billion people is a bad idea. His mistake.<p>However, what I do know is that Westerners in Muslim countries tend to play by the local rules (I am not talking of the U.S. Military in Iraq). By contrast, many Muslims in Western Europe refuse to accept the European culture. Is there racism a part of the problem? Yes, sure it is. But there's more to it: if you reject the local culture, the locals will reject you. Of course, the same goes for Westerners living in Muslim countries. A difference is that  Westerners in Muslim countries are not at the bottom of the barrel as often as Muslims in the West are.<p>In my view it's as simple as this: adapt to our customs, or move back to where you came from. We, Europeans, do not like Muslim foreigners telling us that our women are whores, that we are spiritually dead, that we should not drink, etc. I know a bunch of Muslims living in Europe and, not surprisingly, the ones who are fully integrated in their host society and who have Western friends are the ones who accept the local culture and don't try to preach that their values are any better.",1263303859

1047399,comment,1047238,1047238,0,0,iamelgringo,,,"I've been running an HN meetup called Hackers and Founders meetup ( <a href=""http://hackersandfounders.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hackersandfounders.com</a> ) in Silicon Valley for over a year and a half.  I've seen hundreds of hackers/founders come and go in the last 20 months.  I've also seen a number of people trying to sell consulting services to them.<p>My best guess is that it would be an 80/20 split.  80% of the members of Hackers and Founders would shy away from what you're offering. If you've been in the Valley for any length of time, and do basic networking, you're going to get to know people with ties to investors.  Off the top of my head, I could think of 20 people that I'd go to for advice and introductions if I were looking for investor money right now, and they'd point me in the right direction.  Most of my members might talk to you, but they'd be pretty leery of selling a stake in their corporation before they know you.  I've found that the early stage founders I hang out with at Hackers and Founders tend to mistrust 2 types of people: 1) Pure business guys looking for technical co founders and 2) Money guys offering to help them out in exchange for a piece of the pie.<p>I could be wrong, but I'd think that the 20% of founders that would be most eager to take you up on your offer would be the most desperate of the bunch.  I think that by pitching yourself primarily as a guy who helps people get through the funding pipeline, you're going to be selecting for the wrong type of founders.  I can imagine that founders who aren't in the Valley might be more eager to take you up on your services, as well.  There's a much bigger separation between founder and investor in other parts of the country and world, and those people need quite a bit more help in the funding department.<p>What has really helped the guys at Hackers and Founders are people who are available to be a friend throughout the process.  Generally when the founders pursue the funding process, they turn to their friends who helped them early on, and if those friends have enough experience, those friends become board members (and at times get equity).<p>One of my members in particular has been phenomenal at that. He has a resume similar to yours, and he just hangs out with early stage founders for love of the game.  He talks freely, shares his experiences and advice freely, takes people out to coffee all the time, and when founders are looking for fund raising advice, he's the first person they turn to.<p>What's in it for him, is that he gets to interact with hundreds of entrepreneurs and he can pick and choose the best of them to hook up with and work along side of.  But, the teams that he signs up with trust him implicitly, because they've been getting advice from them for a while.<p>If you have other questions, feel free to ping me.  I'd be happy to talk about it.",1263303121

They've been selling computers and printers with insane bloatware drivers for many years now (at least back to 2004).<p>One might also note a business model where ink cost $8,000/gallon or as some headline noted, more than human blood.  (OK, that's perhaps an acceptable trade off, but it burns first time buyers nonetheless.  About the only good thing here is that HP has the ink jets integrated into their cartridges, so refills are not terribly dangerous.)<p>And then we could get into the post H&P period where the company's treatment of their employees has been quite nasty.  Or the general decline of the quality we used to get from the HP name (I'm still using my HP 28S calculator from the late '80s). Etc. etc. etc. etc.",1263301947

In effect it all comes down to a question of what has value to people.<p>To take music for an example, a digital copy of a song has very little value when compared to something like a live performance which commands a much higher price.  An artist bemoaning the economics of the digital world is like Dell commiserating about the decline in the average selling price of laptops because of the introduction of net books.  If an artist, or anyone, is interested in making more money they should concentrate on making things people are willing to pay more for instead of complaining that people aren't willing to pay for what they want to produce.",1263301651

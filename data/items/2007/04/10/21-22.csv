11553,comment,11285,11285,0,0,knewjax,,,"Rejection the best motivator? or is it just me? The passion to prove yourself and your ideas is more motivating than acceptance. \n \nAnyway we have some extra office space available to share with all you future ycombinator startups that will be locating in boston for the summer. We are located in davis square minutes from harvard sqaure in cambridge. We have been there for 4 months now and have 2-3 desks to spare. You can see pics at dreamvex.com (our soon to be designed blog).<p>If anyone is interested when you move to the city, you can email me at todd at dreamvex.com <p>goodluck to everyone who got an interview.",1176242372
11552,comment,11496,11496,0,0,rokhayakebe,,,"Reality Check. Anyone who was half serious about this application is hurt somehow. The reason why it sucks is not so much due to the fact that you are not going to hang out with ""startupreneurs"" and PG but because this was a competition and  your product was judged not as good as those that made it. That is what hurts. Maybe you can take a step back today and take a look at what you are doing and ask yourself ""How can I make better, more simple and scale it?"" or ""How can we make people see that this is better than other products out there and a business can be built around it?"" because if you believe it is great, than maybe you fail to present it the proper way. \n Take the rest of the day off. Get a drink, socialize, shut that computer down and relax. Tomorrow your head will be clear and you can start working on your startup again. Not because it will make you a millionaire, or because it will get you respect, but just because that is what you love to do and without it your Puzzle is just not complete.\nCiao'",1176242363

We got rejected also, kind of expected since admittedly we were more interested in seeing what startup life was like than our actual idea.<p>My partner and I are off to Silicon Valley anyway for jobs, however the Y-Combinator process has made us hungrier then ever to ultimately do something on our own. <p>I'm going to make sure Google doesn't remain a ""blackhole"" as PG described it :)",1176242224

11526,comment,11491,11492,0,0,zaidf,,,"Depends on what perspective you subscribe to and decide to follow. For example, launching in summer <i>might</i> not get you all the visitors you want but it will also give you time to use summer to optimize your site in time for when summer ends and you <i>supposedly</i> get the new visitors.<p>I did learn in my media planning class that TV use significantly goes down during summer. I've a feeling the same holds true for computer use.",1176240462
11525,comment,11496,11498,0,0,vlad,,,"Sorry to hear, Omar.  I was rejected, too!  <p>I submitted my application on April 6th after I specifically nulled out my entire application before because I didn't want to be in Boston this summer, because I got an e-mail that said ""you had started an application but never clicked Submit.  Please go in and submit it.""  When I went via the special link in the e-mail, I saw that half of my application was still there, even though I specifically had previously deleted each field and saved it blank because I didn't want to apply or to share my information.  So, I said, what the heck, they contacted me, and it seems my details were recovered from their database even though I deleted the fields, and I could say I was special if I both got in and had applied late on the 6th via a special e-mail link, so that made it interesting; so, I clicked Submit.   I'm also a single founder who has a pre-existing corporation, so I guess I struck out on all the important fields that matter. :P  Finally, I also knew from some post here that they say ""please laugh at us if we were wrong to reject you"", so I knew that even if I received such a letter, it would be fun to take them up on the offer. :P<p>The best part about YC, and one I will always be thankful for, is the chance to attend the Startup School.  So, whether you are specifically selected for YC or not, it's good that there are many entrepreneurial peers in Cambridge and Mountain View who you can associate with, thanks to YC.  Second, the articles on this site.  Third, this news.ycombinator.com web site.  Fourth, meeting great people.<p>The 5K+5K per person is great regardless of whether you are selected or not.  I'm rooting for as many teams as possible get selected, versus for any one specific team, because we all benefit from a huge number of peer startups, regardless of who specifically it is.  It's very lonely for those who aren't in those startup hotspots, and news.yc does something in additional to PG's articles--allows people to feel like they're part of the scene in YC, whether they are selected for YC or move to one of those areas themselves, without feeling like strangers.  But, that money isn't going to make or break a startup, and if you decide not to continue because of it (or you haven't already started your idea), time is ticking.",1176240269

For example, we were very reluctant to\naccept proposals with only one founder, because we think starting\na startup is too much work for one person.  We also had a higher\nthreshold for applicants who were still in school, groups where one\nor more members planned to keep their current jobs, and groups that\ncouldn't all move to Boston.  We rejected a lot of proposals simply\nbecause we couldn't understand them, or didn't understand the problem\ndomain well enough to judge them, or because the project seemed too\nbig to start on only three months of funding.

I should have been more precise and called it a ""syntax goof"" instead.)<p>I addressed the ""someone else wrote it two months ago"" point above: If that happened, and this was in the code, <i>it was dead code for two months</i>, because it clearly couldn't have been running correctly.  That's a process problem, not a syntax issue, and the appropriate fix is clearly not to modify the syntax of the language.<p>(<i>Edit for ctdonath: good grief.  1.) the reply was to to3m's post, not yours.   2.) The ""two months"" thing comes straight out of his example, please read it.  3.) It was a JOKE, based on his chiding me for language.  4.) Why are you still flaming about this?</i>)",1334257146

3833735,comment,3831345,3833361,2,0,nzadrozny,,,"There's a lot to be said for ElasticSearch's data distribution. It does sharding and replication really well. That makes my life easier, as a service provider, as well as the life of anyone that has to manage and scale an ES cluster. Or who doesn't want to have to deal with client-side sharding or worry about how many servers can crash before their search goes down.<p>Here's a good video on the subject from ElasticSearch's creator: <a href=""http://vimeo.com/26710663"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vimeo.com/26710663</a><p>ElasticSearch has very little ceremony around creating a new index and getting started with using it. You will eventually need to do some configuration to tune its behavior for your specific application, but the learning curve is nice and gradual. This makes ES great for exploration.<p>The JSON document store aspect of ElasticSearch is indeed very nice. The RESTful API is simple enough that you don't really need a client, just grab your favorite HTTP client library and start integrating. Plus, coupled with solid distribution, you're looking at a pretty viable standalone data store, IMO.<p>Also, very good documentation. And its user/developer community is all full of the really smart, enthusiastic early-adopter types right now :)<p>Not least, Lucene itself is hands down the last word when it comes to search.",1334257092

They get all of their 'relevancy' from bing, and blekko. The reason you like them is because they clean up these results, provide peripheral add-ons like user privacy, no ads, easier syntax for power users, and one-boxes which function more as a knowledge-base than a search engine. They don't crawl/index the web. or if they do, we haven't heard anything about it, or seen any different relevancy rankings from the BOSS api. So they are really a new face to already extant search engines.<p>You mention a 'bidding war'.  Who would buy them?  Any 'features' they provide can be copied by msft/google if they feel threatened.  They don't have their own backend search technology so partners who might want to do search with them, ask.com, search.com, etc. have no reason to work with them as opposed to the BOSS api themselves or even Bing.

For the conversations, I take that she would basically execute algorithms by hand and process information in the same way a RDBMS would in the present, even if she does not have the technical vocabulary to describe it that way.<p>So, the fact that you think those jobs are ""unskilled"" reflects a lot of how, as a society, we have come to trivialize a whole economic activity that was rendered obsolete by technology.

I'm referring to a passion for and respect of people that shines over their love of technology (it's still strong -- love of people and tech aren't mutually exclusive). Figuring out what customers want, how to reach them, making a good product, etc. It's all rooted in a deep respect for their users, potential users, or even people they've met.<p>This absolutely extends into technical writing. Have you ever read horrible specs? :) They're time wasters, frustrating, and almost insulting. If you care about your audience, and I mean really care, you'll produce damn good specs.",1334254196
3833536,comment,3833200,3833459,8,0,billpatrianakos,,,"The lines are starting to blur though. These days a good generalist with a penchant for the front end is probably more desirable than a pure frot end design person. If you're working with teams then version control is mandatory. JavaScript is now being used far more beyond just DOM manipulation, SASS/LESS/Stylus are, for many, required knowledge even if you're just doing static sites, etc. Point being, the lines are blurring the the skillets are breeding with each other creating a need for generalists more than ever.<p>You're right when you say this is probably more useful for web apps than static sites but even static sites are starting to become more app-ish. More emphasis is (rightly) being placed on things like server optimization and load times which requires just a bit more knowledge of what's going on in the backend than before. Take HTML5 Boilerplate for example. Their Apache .htaccess file is something that the front end guys should understand and even if you're working alone buildin a static site you should start getting into setting up those rules correctly and putting a lot of that stuff into Apache's httpd.conf. Basic CMS knowledge <i>is</i> required. Everyone ends up working with a CMS eventually unless your entire career is based on building single page static sites editable in Dreamweaver alone or something. Then there's new toys like Jekyll. Jekyll and its beginner friendly cousin Octopress require you to know a few things about the backend too and in fact require most of the skills the article describes.<p>So you're right to a point but it looks like as we move forward even web publishing will start to resemble web app development more and more as far as tools and workflows go. Gosh, even FTP is starting to go the way of Gopher. I hope I see the day that even shared hosts start allowing and encouraging SSH usage over FTP as the norm almost like MediaTemple does.",1334254174

The client sends its Finished and first ApplicationData message instead of waiting for the server's Finished message. Adam thought that since they put the two client messages in a single packet, servers would either fail to handle it or succeed.<p>However, he found that some servers would fail inconsistently. His explanation for that has to do with internal synchronization of various tasks within the server process, although it's only a guess. Whatever the case, it means their efforts to test SSL servers to see if they can support False Start would have to be redone, and it's not clear how many times they'd have to test a server to be sure it could handle False Start since the failures are intermittent.<p>In short, the Internet is a messy place, and standards are only reliable to the extent that implementations are robustly tested for every corner case.

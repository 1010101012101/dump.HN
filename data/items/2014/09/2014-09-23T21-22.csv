8358590,comment,8357736,8358482,1,0,dragonwriter,,,"> My problem is, I&#x27;m not sure what MD 917 (b) means.<p>Probably Annotated Code of Maryland Section 13-1601(b), added by House Bill 917, means exactly what it says. &quot;<i>Notwithstanding any provision in the federal regulations</i> on the protection of human subjects <i>that limits the applicability of the federal regulations to certain research</i>, subsection (a) of this section applies to all research using a human subject.&quot; (emphasis added)<p>> §46.102 (b) has a list of human research which is exempt.<p>But those exemptions are a provision of the federal regulations which limits the applicability of the federal regulation to certain research, and so are <i>expressly excluded</i> from the part of the regulation incorporated into Maryland law by Section 13-1601(b).<p>> Otherwise - and this is another tricky part - §46.102 (c) says &quot;Department or agency heads retain final judgment as to whether a particular activity is covered by this policy.&quot;<p>This, again, is a provision of the federal regulations which limits the applicability of the federal regulation to certain research (to those things not excluded by the relevant funding department/agency head), and so are <i>expressly excluded</i> from the part of the regulation incorporated into Maryland law by 917(b). So there&#x27;s no need to figure out how it applies -- it doesn&#x27;t.<p>> However, if that&#x27;s the case then the other exceptions of §46.102 (b) are also no longer allowed<p>Note that, if you go through the link you posted and click on the final passed (Third Reading) version of the bill and note the edits from the prior version, that <i>prior</i> version of the bill had express language incorporating the exceptions in 45 CFR § 46.102(b) as exceptions to the Maryland law, and this was stricken in favor of the language now present expressly disregarding any exceptions in the federal regulations. This makes it pretty clear that, <i>whether or not this is desirable</i>, the legislative intent was very expressly <i>not</i> to incorporate the exceptions in 45 CFR § 46.102(b).",1411509497

(And I can relate to you on the Irish cultural issues as well, since my mother is from Ireland and I grew up mainly around Irish people).<p>Mostly, it&#x27;s a matter of getting them through the psychiatrist&#x27;s door.  Hearing, &quot;I think you might be depressed&quot; or &quot;Why don&#x27;t you go see someone&quot; -- however you frame it -- is going to be tough to hear from a son.  A therapist, though, knows how to ask the right questions, and since they&#x27;re a neutral third party, they&#x27;re much more likely to get a person to admit that there&#x27;s a problem, and that the lost job may have been merely the catalyst for what is now a medical problem.<p>Depression is less and less stigmatized in the US (I don&#x27;t know about the situation in Ireland).  But in a sense, that doesn&#x27;t matter.  It&#x27;s the person&#x27;s own self-stigmatization that is the problem.  They don&#x27;t think they have a medical problem; they think they&#x27;re worthless, sad, listless, and perhaps &quot;crazy.&quot; Going to a psychiatrist will automatically mean that they <i>are</i> crazy.<p>I am not a mental health professional, but in my view, it&#x27;s worth trying any trick you can think of to get them through the door.  Maybe that means a group/family intervention (and maybe <i>that</i> means she&#x27;s angry at the entire family for some period of time).  Maybe it means cutting deals (&quot;If you just make this one appointment, I&#x27;ll never mention it again.&quot;).  Maybe it means an emotional appeal (&quot;Please, please do this for me.&quot;).<p>Whatever the case, extreme measures sometimes are necessary.  Because -- and I don&#x27;t mean to frighten you -- this is a <i>deadly</i> illness.  People commit suicide every year because they see absolutely no reason to go on.

That&#x27;s why banks are safer than Bitcoin: A robber can&#x27;t extract money from a bank without getting caught, but a robber can empty your brainwallet in a way that hides where the money has gone.<p>As for holding a loved one hostage, kidnapping for money hasn&#x27;t worked for a long time.  The failure rate for kidnappers demanding money is around 100% in the US.  But kidnapping will become much more lucrative if Bitcoin catches on in the way you&#x27;re imagining. It needs consumer protections.<p>Once bitcoin has consumer protections, it will be very valuable. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m advocating the protections. It&#x27;s a necessary step in Bitcoin&#x27;s development.<p>EDIT: To put it another way, instances of kidnapping and theft are rare because the current system defends against them, not because they&#x27;re inherently rare.  If bitcoin catches on without protections afforded by banks, then kidnapping and theft will likely become more common, because those tactics will be lucrative again.",1411508962

The way it does this is it actually mounts itself as a FUSE filesystem and keeps it&#x27;s own LRU cache of your spacemonkey data on the drive. If you access a recently created or accessed file it will just load from the disk cache.  If it detects that you are running out of hard drive space it will automatically prune the stuff that hasn&#x27;t been accessed in a while (so spacemonkey never causes you to have an &quot;Out of disk space&quot; error).  you still see it though, it tells you its size, metadata etc. and if you try to open one of those files it will grab it from the network transparently behind the scene for you it just might add a little bit of latency (as if you were accessing something on a network share).<p>In 2014 you should not have to be thinking about what to &quot;selectively sync&quot; the service you use should just figure it out for you (and let you customize it if you need to)<p>disclamer: I used to work for spacemonkey but do not any more, although I think they make a great product and are a super smart team.",1411508852

If you do everything linearly, it will take you a long time to get anything done. Learn how long individual passive steps take and determine what you can actively get done in the down time- especially true when making multiple dishes at once. Also, limit the complexity of your sides. It&#x27;s much faster/easier to steam some broccoli and carrots while cooking a steak than it is to pair the steak with loaded mashed potatoes and caesar salad.

I believe that&#x27;s the case, because §46.102 (a) (2) only applies to those organizations which are regulated by a federal department, so would already be covered under the law.<p>Section §46.102 (b) has a list of human research which is exempt. The most relevant for Facebook and OkCupid appears to be:<p>> (2) Research involving the use of educational tests (cognitive, diagnostic, aptitude, achievement), survey procedures, interview procedures or observation of public behavior, unless: (i) information obtained is recorded in such a manner that human subjects can be identified, directly or through identifiers linked to the subjects; and (ii) any disclosure of the human subjects&#x27; responses outside the research could reasonably place the subjects at risk of criminal or civil liability or be damaging to the subjects&#x27; financial standing, employability, or reputation. [Note: does not apply to children.]<p>If A/B testing falls under &#x27;educational tests&#x27; or &#x27;survey procedures&#x27; then it&#x27;s exempt.<p>Otherwise - and this is another tricky part - §46.102 (c) says &quot;Department or agency heads retain final judgment as to whether a particular activity is covered by this policy.&quot;<p>Who is the department head for Facebook and OkCupid?  §46.102 (a) defines it as:<p>> (a) Department or agency head means the head of any federal department or agency and any other officer or employee of any department or agency to whom authority has been delegated.<p>MD 917 doesn&#x27;t have the information for how to interpret §46.102 outside of the federal context for which it was written.<p>An alternative interpretation of MD 917 (b) is that <i>no</i> human testing is exempt, including §46.102 (b) (2) which allows surveys. Instead, <i>all</i> testing must go through an IRB.<p>However, if that&#x27;s the case then the other exceptions of §46.102 (b) are also no longer allowed, including<p>> (4) Research involving the collection or study of existing data, documents, records, pathological specimens, or diagnostic specimens, if these sources are publicly available or if the information is recorded by the investigator in such a manner that subjects cannot be identified, directly or through identifiers linked to the subjects.<p>which would require IRB review for every historian working out of previously published materials.<p>Therefore, I don&#x27;t think this alternative interpretation is correct.<p>Which means I don&#x27;t know if MD 917 really applies to OkCupid or Facebook. (The Facebook research was published in a journal which follows the Common Rule compliance; I presume the journals have a way to resolve the question of what &quot;department head&quot; means when there is no department head - it must have come up before. I only investigated MD 917 compliance here.)<p>_EDIT_ : The MD attorney general clarified this at <a href=""http://www.oag.state.md.us/Healthpol/hb917letter.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.oag.state.md.us/Healthpol/hb917letter.pdf</a> .<p>> Implicit in the federal regulations, and therefore in House Bill 917&#x27;s mandate for compliance with these regulations, is the requirement that a person have in place a reasonable process for determining whether research falls within one of the exempt categories.<p>So determining if A/B testing is exempt comes down to if there&#x27;s a reasonable process for determining if it&#x27;s exempt. It&#x27;s not clearly illegal.",1411508511

The war went ahead as scheduled.<p>Protest is totally irrelevant in the modern world. It is shuffled into free speech zones or tear gassed, LRAD&#x27;d, and pepper sprayed out of the way. &quot;Less-lethal&quot; armaments and massive police militarization means that there will never be another Kent State to shock us into action; instead, the state can play an indefinite game of divide-and-conquer by marginalizing anyone more radical than Ralph Nader, helped by centrist opportunists.<p>I lived in Washington, DC most of my life. There were always protests. When the police decided the protests would stop, they would roll in the APCs and the LRADs and flex-cuffs and stop them. Most of the time there was no need, since the protesters did the police&#x27;s job for them, herding themselves into cages and keeping their voices down.<p>You could say that more people need to be there, or that the demand needs to be clearer, or that the movement needs to be more cohesive, but you can literally always say those things, so they aren&#x27;t really useful criticisms. Rather, they betray a sort of Boxer-esque &quot;we must work harder&quot; mindset where it&#x27;s always the fault of the protesters for <i>not trying hard enough</i> in their use of a wholly ineffective tool.<p>Combine this with state and corporate control of virtually all news media, and a surveillance and police system that is able to destabilize any social justice movement before it even begins (Occupy was a great example of this), you have an unshakable state that can enact whatever policies it wishes.<p>Ironically, pleading to Google is probably more successful than pleading to your congressman.

I think I&#x27;ve seen some companies trying to attract talent like that now that I think about it (was it stack exchange perhaps?). I might underestimate the power of the almighty buck here, but I&#x27;d take the employer that says &quot;we value work/life balance, when we say 40h/week we mean it literally, we allow remote work, and we have 5 paid weeks off&quot;.<p>As for my questions above, it still doesn&#x27;t add upp. Either you don&#x27;t have kids as long as you hold one of these jobs or at least both parents can&#x27;t have such jobs, so it&#x27;s basically a job that requires one parent to stay at home at least part time? Or you need a nanny to pick up your kids after school/kindergarten?\nMy guess is that you are going to say that normally one parent (and not a random one) just stays home for years after having kids, but that would be a real blow to my view of SF/NYC as progressive...<p>It seems odd to me that people making a lot of money (which I hope these salaries are considered), wouldn&#x27;t just invest a huge chunk of it in family/free time, by simply working less hours, e.g. 75% at 75% pay.<p>With my european glasses, the salaries look huge, but of course I haven&#x27;t factored the cost of living and certainly not the impact on work/life balance. I hold a well paid (by local standards) full time dev job, and I drop off kids at 8 and pick them up at 4.30. Every other day my wife does that so I can work a bit longer. I never manage to do 40h at the office, but it&#x27;s considered normal for people with kids to leave early and do an hour or so of work in the evening.<p>Not sure what my point is, I guess it&#x27;s that I&#x27;m surprised of how a &quot;culture of work&quot; can form in this way in a country that is often percieved as valuing family quite a lot, especially in progressive regions where presumably equality means a lot. Also I&#x27;m surprised of how employers (candidates, rather) aren&#x27;t pushing the compensation in a more work/life balance friendly direction.

We want something in the event/messaging space.<p>But it isn&#x27;t even a want. If you don&#x27;t have it, you end up with each of the your components actually being very tightly coupled to all the other components it talks to and you&#x27;ve got a truly monolithic mess on your hands.<p>> It&#x27;s a bad idea to have the OS impose too much structure on your IPC, in the same way that it&#x27;s a bad idea to have the base class in an object hierarchy try to take on too many subclass-specific responsibilities.  This is because over-specialization of a component needlessly constrains the designs of systems that use it.<p>This isn&#x27;t exactly a new concept or a new problem. There are plenty of existing cases where this is happening (basically every platform I can think of right this moment, though I&#x27;m sure there are plenty of exceptions), including in the current Linux udev mechanism.<p>> But we already have this universally-parsable data format:  it&#x27;s called human-readable text.  It&#x27;s why you can &quot;grep&quot; and &quot;awk&quot; and &quot;sed&quot; the outputs of &quot;ls&quot; and &quot;find&quot; and &quot;cat&quot;, for example.<p>/me falls out of chair.<p>Yeah, that&#x27;s worked out great. Never had a problem with init scripts not extracting the right column or handling a new variant in how the output comes out (or even better still, the dreaded &quot;value with embedded whitespace&quot;).<p>But you know what? DBus is basically human readible with a bit more imposed structure than generic streams. So, I think you are arguing in support of the systemd approach without realizing it! ;-)<p>> First, udev is Linux-specific--it uses netlink sockets to listen for Linux-specific hardware events.  Second, not everyone uses udev and dbus.  mdev, smdev, eudev, and static /dev are also widely used and have well-defined use-cases that udev does not serve, and plenty of servers (and even my laptop) get along just fine without dbus.<p>Very true. I was speaking in generalities. Point being, udev is out there and very thoroughly established as something that people seem to generally want.<p>> The IPC layer does not know and cannot anticipate the security needs of every single application.  If you try to design your IPC system to do this, you will fail to encompass every possible case.<p>You have some ambitious notions for the systemd project that go well beyond the goals that critics say are overly broad in scope. This is for addressing a relatively narrow set of problems that wouldn&#x27;t even come close to defining 1% of IPC on a LInux system. I&#x27;m not suggesting we replace the entire Unix toolset with a complete new set of interfaces and programs (nor are the systemd guys). This is specifically for managing the interactions between devices & daemons... It&#x27;s a well established problem domain with some well established roles & responsibilities and some pretty well understood data message/event structures.<p>While it might use systemd/dbus/whatever to get notifications about various services and system events, YOUR BANKING SOFTWARE IS NOT SUPPOSED TO USE SYSTEMD TO MOVE MONEY BETWEEN YOUR ACCOUNTS!<p>> Again, what&#x27;s so special about DBus, besides the fact that it&#x27;s the New Shiny?<p>DBus isn&#x27;t the new shiny. It&#x27;s the old shiny. The new shiny would probably be 0mq or some of the new datagram protocols that people are experimenting with, along with various extensible binary protocols like MessagePack and Cap&#x27;nProto.<p>What&#x27;s special about DBus is that it is already being used very broadly on Unix platforms for this kind of function and is well integrated in to the system security model. The one bit of additional coolness it brings to the table is the support for socket activation, which simplifies the complexity of start ordering and discovery tremendously, which is indeed a VERY nice benefit, but could no doubt have been NIH&#x27;d independently.<p>> If I&#x27;m writing a secure service of any kind, you can be damn certain I&#x27;m thinking about a LOT more than input validation!  Security encompasses waaaaaaaaaay more than that.<p>Yes, but the point is one derives substantial benefit from trusted components in the system that take care of their part of the problem. You don&#x27;t benefit from having to reimplement an entire security apparatus with each component. This is basic security compartmentalization 101.<p>> Things like scalability, fault tolerance, concurrency, and consistency come to mind. There is no silver bullet for any of these, let alone an IPC system that solves them all at once!<p>You appear to be simultaneously claiming there is no silver bullet and being terribly upset that systemd isn&#x27;t one.<p>Yes, it is no silver bullet. It&#x27;s not even the huge sea change that some people seem to think it is. Rather, it is an incremental improvement over existing practices that gets rid of a bit more of the cruft and stupidity in the existing infrastructure. Doing that kind of thing right can really make a big difference for the system as a whole, but it isn&#x27;t the apocalypse.",1411507671

I&#x27;m (mostly) vegan, and I get a better diversity of food by doing it myself.  It&#x27;s more cost effective.  My food is more healthy, and I&#x27;m a far better cook than the average food you get at a cheap restaurant (and the expensive ones are just that. :).  Add to that that my kid has some digestive allergies -- but I cooked when I was a single omnivore, too, but only 5 days/week instead of 6-7.<p>2)  Half and half.  Big meal components get planned on weekends so that I only have to shop once per week.  Sides, veggies, salads I replan dynamically based upon what&#x27;s in the fridge and what looked good at the store.<p>3)  If you read through Veganomicon, World Vegetarian, Vegan Eats World, and some random Chinese and Indian cookbooks, plus a little bit of Julia Child, you&#x27;ll have it nailed! :)<p>4)  I&#x27;m vegan, family&#x27;s not, but no - just no meat/dairy.<p>5)  Practice.  Force yourself to accept restrictions on how and what you cook with -- try cooking vegetarian, vegan, every cuisine of the world.  Read the food science texts, too, because understanding <i>why</i> things work gives you room to experiment.  Experiment.  You&#x27;ll f- it up.  That&#x27;s ok, it&#x27;s still edible.<p>Learn to chop efficiently and get a really sharp, appropriate-weight (for you) chef&#x27;s knife or santoku.

I&#x27;ve had great managers that had great rapport with the team and everyone was tight knit enough that the manager could stand in the hall and say &quot;hey, come over here and look at the ridiculous code Bill wrote&quot; and it would all be in good fun, even for the person who was being mocked (being able to laugh at your own mistakes is important, IMO).  And on the other hand, I&#x27;ve had terrible managers who aren&#x27;t able to do it in a good-natured manner and it ends up being mean-spirited, condescending, and morale-killing.  There&#x27;s a surprisingly fine line between &quot;lol, Bill, what were you thinking?&quot; and &quot;Bill wrote bad code and I&#x27;m going to call him on it, making everyone on the team uncomfortable, and thus cultivating an environment where everyone lives in fear of making a mistake.&quot;",1411507141

8358321,comment,8356489,8356489,1,0,Cyranix,,,"1. A variety of reasons. The result of a tasty, nutritious meal is probably the main motivator, followed by challenge factor (I push myself to cook a somewhat wide variety of dishes), followed by cost. I pay for quality ingredients but still probably come out ahead on cost.<p>2. Most of the time, I plan a week at a time, but that might only be three or four dinners, as I plan on leftovers and usually eat out once a week. I keep a running list of meal ideas next to the week&#x27;s plan on a whiteboard in my kitchen.<p>3. I try to stick with seasonal vegetables and that often guides my meal choices. I cook for/with vegetarians, vegans, and people with various allergies these days, which sometimes changes my plans; I get more latitude when cooking for myself. Green curry (with paste made from scratch) is the dish I&#x27;m most often asked to cook for groups; pulled pork and braised leg of lamb are also quite popular. I try to rotate through various protein sources during each week (including meatless), and while meat is often a star of my meals, they&#x27;re mostly vegetables by at least a 2:1 ratio. Oh, and there&#x27;s usually one meal per week that&#x27;s stir-fry to use up lingering veggies.<p>4. No specifically named diet. I began to cut back on breads and sweets a couple of months ago to help shed a few errant pounds (I&#x27;m moderately fit at 135 lbs now), but other than that I generally eat what I want. I never drink soft drinks, rarely drink alcohol, and choose snacking carbs wisely.<p>5. I feel like most productivity hacks are geared towards squeezing every bit of efficiency out of one&#x27;s time. While there are some useful common-sense ideas — establishing mise en place, caring for your equipment, etc. — I usually encourage people to tackle efficiency from the other angle. Instead of fretting about doing a lot in a little time, slow down a bit and carve out plenty of time to make a meal well. Meat needs time to get tender, bread needs time to proof, etc. The main thing I encourage new cooks to do is invest in spices, because having a solid core set of them makes a huge difference in the quality of results and new cooks are sometimes hesitant to try recipes that call for spices they don&#x27;t have on hand.",1411507021

I always have a lot of eggs and onions which don&#x27;t seem to go bad for a while. In the freezer I have fish, bags of frozen veggies. In the cupboard I have canned beans and canned tuna.<p>3.

I do if I have a special event on the horizon (holiday, dinner party, that kind of thing) or I am going to pack food for travel. Otherwise I just make a mental plan based on what I have and what is available/in season.<p>3.

Hello Hotel California!<p><i></i>EDIT<i></i> to explain scummy, its because it allows the big funds to &quot;jump the queue&quot; if you will.  Scummy may have been a poor choice of words.<p>Rather than having to be active in the market with a quote on the NBBO, this allows the big funds to look at each order and say, pass, pass , take, pass, take, etc.<p>If there is money in filling the order they will, if not they will pass it onto the market where it will either sit or get filed by those who actually participate in the market.",1411506105

Saves time and aggravation with my autistic four year old.  And it&#x27;s enjoyable.<p>2) If something is on sale at the grocery store, I&#x27;ll plan out a specific meal around it (steak and peppers, for example) but otherwise I don&#x27;t make a detailed plan.<p>3) I do a lot of one-pot or two-pot meals.  One pot is grain (rice, pasta, or potatoes) and the other is a meat-veggie mix.  Sometimes it&#x27;s curry, sometimes it&#x27;s more beef-and-tomatoes, sometimes lemon chicken with asparagus.<p>4) I have in the past done weight watchers (the points plan that was popular in ~2008).  This is easily adaptable -- the meat-and-veggie dish is usually fairly low calorie and nutritiously filling, and using brown rice or whole wheat pasta with a small portion size keeps the points down.<p>5) I think of the dishes I make as essentially templates.  I know how to make a decent Chicken Vindaloo, but I can turn it into Pork With A Different Blend of Spices And Veggies using the exact same cooking techniques and it&#x27;s still good.<p>My favorite tools: a deep frying pan with a lid, a slow cooker, and a pressure cooker (especially for rice -- I live at altitude.)",1411506090

8358211,comment,8357789,8357789,2,0,ramLlama,,,"This is a very interesting problem, espeicially since consumer computing devices quickly shunted to small storage space when SSD&#x27;s arrived. A few years ago, a laptop with 500GB of hard drive space was rather small! Nowadays, a 500GB SSD is top-tier. Granted, SSD capacity is quickly rising, but with the combination of small computing like phones and tablets, space is at a premium.<p>Funnily enough, this problem has been solved before! If you look at distributed file systems, especially something like Coda (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coda_(file_system)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coda_(file_system)</a>), they are designed to make the local computer a &quot;thin client for storage&quot;. Basically, local storage is used as a cache for the main copy on the server, and this behavior is transparent to user applications via the FS driver.<p>Dropbox uses a user-space program to sync the files and cannot intercept system calls. As such, they had no choice but to synchronize all of it rather than bringing things in &quot;on-demand&quot; and releasing local copies that are not used. Nowadays, this can easily be done via FUSE driver in Linux. I do not know if something like FUSE exists on other platforms though.<p>Overall, I personally love the idea of a local machine being a &quot;cache&quot; for the server copy. However, the technical challenges are greater than a simple mirroring scheme, and there may be UX issues as well.",1411506072

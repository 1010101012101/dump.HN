7579357,comment,7576445,7578838,2,0,ThePhysicist,,,"Basically for two reasons:<p>-To my knowledge it&#x27;s still a completely hypothetical technology without an existing proof-of-concept prototype, so it&#x27;s unclear how fast it could be brought to maturity.<p>-Supposing it could be realized as planned it&#x27;s still unlikely that the initial cost-effectiveness would be better than that of existing, alternative solutions such as the Maglev, Transrapid or even conventional bullet trains, which haven&#x27;t yet reached their theoretical limitations in speed and efficiency.<p>An example: At an hypothetical average speed of 960 km/h (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperloop"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperloop</a>), the Hyperloop could traverse the distance between LA and SF in about 30 mins. For comparison, the current speed record for a TGV is 560 km/h, which yields a theoretical travel time of slightly less than 1 hour for the same route. I think it&#x27;s questionable whether the 30 minute gain in travel time would justify the large amount or R&D necessary to make the Hyperloop a reality, let alone make this a viable economic undertaking. Of course this doesn&#x27;t mean that it&#x27;s impossible (it is not), just that I think it won&#x27;t become a reality in the near future (but then again, people tend to be horribly wrong when making predictions about this kind of stuff).",1397339927

If so, then you can charge customers less, giving you an advantage.<p>Ordering - there could just be a tablet with an app that lets you see the menu, answers all your questions, shows you pictures of the food and nutritional info and stuff, and lets you order when you&#x27;re ready.<p>Water refills - just provide each table with a pitcher.<p>Bringing food to you (and other things like condiments) - One option is to still have servers bring it to you. But it would cost much less because the ordering app lets them be more efficient with their time. Another option is to have the tablet alert you when your food is ready, and you can go get it.",1397339827

What ends up happening is waiters fight to get the tables with white males, and adjust their service for each (better service for while males, poor service for black families).<p>And that creates a feedback loop. It is absolutely true that black people generally tip less, and that waitstaff generally seat them badly and give terrible service. Even black waitstaff get caught up in it with experience. Tipping is the problem here.",1397339802

Otherwise hours would probably be much less convenient for the customer. This may not be the case in a large city but in smaller towns the weekday shifts are also a rite of passage to earn a good night where you can make some money.",1397339762

Companies these days don&#x27;t allow for upward movement unless you&#x27;re willing to spend a decade playing nice with the right people and consistently over-delivering.  On the other hand, changing jobs from company to company likely benefits the employee much more by allowing him or her to enter in to a new role that they are fully qualified for.  The same goes for pay, even if its a similar role.  The primary goal of a Company is to pay the employee as little as possible in order to get the most out of them fulfilling their duties in the role that they were hired to fill.  Having the boat rocked by folks changing roles (upward movement) or increasing salaries is something that each Company tries hard to avoid.",1397339626

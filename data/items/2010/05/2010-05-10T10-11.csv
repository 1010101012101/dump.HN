We reinforce that by showing that the rationals are countable, that Q^2 is countable, in fact Q^n is countable.  Even the algebraics are countable.  We create the intuition that anything infinite is countable.<p>Then we present 2^N and everything goes bizarre.  Some people like that, but others decide that it's all meaningless.  I think this method of presentation does the majority of people a disservice.<p>But not only is there the set-theoretic infinity, there is also the geometric infinity.  That actually better matches people's intuition.  Separating the ideas of the set theoretic and the geometric versions of infinity has, I'm finding, huge benefits when trying to help people understand what's going on.<p>Of course, there's also cardinal versus ordinal infinities as well.

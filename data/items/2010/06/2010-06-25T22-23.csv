They're not going to remove features from the language, because that would break existing code for no reason, and that would be insane.  The only reason to remove a feature is if it can cause damage.  Maybe Scheme should get rid of call-with-current-continuation, but I can't think of any features C# needs to get rid of.

As I told someone else at Facebook today, unfortunately it's difficult to gain traction without a compelling headline.  However the article doesn't specify a specific change in strategy just a continuation of the existing one.<p>As I posted this morning, declaring war may be a bit of an exaggeration, however most people have been unaware that content off Facebook shows up in search results and that pages can be optimized for such.<p>At f8 this was announced but not until recently did I begin seeing results that link off-site.  The article was a way to illustrate how the Open Graph underlies Facebook's search strategy.  Until you show the average user a picture of what that means, theoretical discussion only gets so far.<p>I hope it wasn't interpreted as a shift in strategy, but a photo is worth a thousand words and a headline can multiply that!  You and I (as well as most people on this site) understood the implications of the Open Graph, but the average user had no idea what it meant.<p>The search results image makes things more apparent.  Happy to adjust if you think this is excessive sensationalism ... this is definitely an ambitious search strategy no matter which way you cut it.<p>Best,

Every place I've seen has a 2-4 Palantir engineers working F/T there during the deployment phase and at least 1 or 2 FTEs to maintain the ontology as mission requirements change (""oh, now we need VIN numbers associated with vehicles!"").<p>I'd imagine it's getting faster as staff gets trained and various little ETL tools are built to funnel data into the backend. But it's been a very frustrating process for most of the customers to drop the money on the deployment and not have an operational tool for the better part of their first year, and the maintenance tail has been reported to be some percentage higher than the original purchase (that may have changed, I've noticed the pricing structure has been changing quite a bit over the last year).<p>Of course, I also understand that when the customer says ""pump data source X into Palantir"" and data source X requires a 6 month approval process to hook up to, it can just take a while.",1277505192

I feel like a large section of the developer community doesn't understand the power of BBM. It's an application developed by RIM that allows for high speed conversations similar to texting except instead of sending messages over the SMS protocol, it uses the PIN message infrastructure that RIM developed so that it could push emails at a very high speed to phones.
BBM is RIM's secret sauce to their cell phones. It's amazing to me, but having a text-based conversation with someone over BBM is ENTIRELY different than even a threaded SMS conversation on two iPhones. Firstly, the messages are sent between the phones much quicker. It comes with complete outbound/read/delivery reports, and allows for a much greater level of complexity in the messages that are sent. Secondly, it uses a buddying system that changes the dynamic of conversation. You have your normal contact list, and then your 'bbm contacts'. I have 90 BBM contacts, (mind you those are all over people I know who also have Blackberrys and we have connected the two phones), but at school I knew people who had 250 or more. Thirdly, it allows for inline insertion of almost any content one wants. Be that sound notes, music, pictures, etc. It also allows for GROUP chatting. In a way that is simply impossible with SMS and the way SMS billing works with the American cell phone companies today.
I can't stress enough, there is a developer GOLDMINE here. The first group that writes an app which takes advantage of the inter-phone PIN messaging system that RIM has developed to do more than just BBM is going to be looking at a lot of money. I've had friends ask me multiple times why I didn't develop an app that would allow you to play chess or battleship against your BBM contacts (those are two simple ideas, the possibilities are immense), and after some research I got sort of turned off by the BBM api calls. There didn't seem to be enough of them, and the documentation was quite confusing. I feel like the next iteration of the Blackberry API will change this though, and I have a hunch that there is going to be a new wave of apps specially designed to take advantage of this system.
Keep in mind there's nothing like this on iPhone. There is no special code, (like the Bberry PIN) that I can give someone to specially link our two iPhones.

It's not a comprehensive ontology, but one that's domain specific to that customer -- which actually has the potential to work really well. So for example, the FBI would get one that targets law enforcement (people, places, addresses, license plates, violations, prior convictions, gangs, etc.), while the Army might get one that's focused around military operations (people, places, rank, equipment, unit, etc.).<p>They then custom write Java software that connects one of the customer databases to theirs, and probably either mirrors it and links it all to some metadata, or if it's federated, generates a pile of metadata with pointers/links back to the original data. The meta-data itself can actually be very very comprehensive. For example, assume the original data is a news report, that report might have everything from tagged people and their attributes to photos of some of the people, videos, maps, whatever (actually I think they just store a list of entity IDs and then store the rest of the junk oriented around the entities, but it's not that important). But basically it's a custom ETL tool for each data source.<p>I believe it's in that code that they also tell the Palantir enterprise backend how to map individual fields from the incoming data to entity types in the ontology. Assume instead of news articles, you are connecting to a phone book. You have to map names to people, numbers to phone numbers and addresses to locations (or whatever they have it called in that particular instance of the ontology at that site), etc. If it's a yellow pages, you can map names to businesses instead of people, etc. The ontology itself is mutable, so they can decide post-facto that they would like to add a new attribute to a person ""place of birth"". So if their knowledge base has phonebooks AND birth certificates, when you go to inspect an entity, like a person, it'll retrieve the place of birth and build you a nice dossier of that person.<p>In cases where they're consuming unstructured data (the lions share of government reports), there's no fields to map to the ontology. So analysts have to sift through each report and do the mapping with the front-end tool while they are conducting analysis. I know of at least one site that's in the process of hiring out a bunch of low-paid data entry people simply to go through and do this tag-map operation on their reports.<p><i>If</i> ahead of time, the reports have been run through an enterprise named entity extractor, they <i>can</i> leverage those to populate the knowledge base. But in practice, quality is low, and the named entity extractors tend not to do a good job of determining different subclasses of entities. For example, you'll get a giant list of people from a document, but no indication if a particular person is a scientist, a politician or a terrorist (and all three of those categories might be entity types in the ontology for that site). In addition, the key factor here is the relationships between entities and between entities and their attributes. And most named entity extractors do an even poorer job determining that than just finding the entities. So the default at most sites is to have shifts of analysts manually tagging and mapping documents.<p>On the front-end, when you search for a person in the little search box, you can not only get documents that name might appear in, but you can call up a dossier on them with all the little various attributes and other bits and pieces filled in for you. Imagine a police record like you see on TV, with the person's photos and other facts and figures and such -- except that it's generated dynamically based on all the tagged and mapped meta-data, and come be composed of data from several different sources at once, like a phone book, a DMB database and a million news reports.",1277504144

Back then, the web was split between two major browsers: IE and Netscape.  However, the feature set of what was supported in JS was not only completely different among the two, but also completely different among <i>different minor versions</i> of the two.  Things that worked on Netscape 6.x would be broken on 6.(x+1), and work again in 6.(x+2), although with a different calling convention.  It was mind-numbingly frustrating, and I don't think it would have been humanly possible to write JS that supported all minor iterations of each browser and maintained any sort of complex functionality.<p>By contrast, in 2006, I wrote a JS library that worked on IE6, Firefox 1.0+, and some early version of Safari.  It has worked ever since, among dozens of versions of those browsers.

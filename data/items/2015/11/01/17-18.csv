I have no problem with most people calling RC helicopters &quot;drones&quot;, etc.<p>In this case, I&#x27;m pointing out that &quot;dark patterns&quot; <i>already</i> has a rich accumulation of psychological tricks on web transactions. Thaler can build on top of that shared knowledge.  For example, people can go to darkpatterns.org and then click on &quot;Browse Library&quot; and learn many more variations of what Thaler is discussing.  If a reader is only exposed to the phrase &quot;bad nudge&quot;, <i>he/she knows less instead of more.</i><p>Do people want to eventually converge on &quot;bad nudges&quot; instead of &quot;dark patterns&quot;?  I don&#x27;t care.  But at the moment, &quot;dark patterns&quot; is the phrase that has attracted the bulk of discussion.

What if both are good enough?<p>Prior to Slack existing, lots of people who now use Slack weren&#x27;t using IRC, because Slack offers a lot more.<p>Everyone I know working in academia or on a startup that uses any kind of instant chat uses Slack. None of them previously used IRC for the same purpose.<p>And it&#x27;s just _obvious_ why, once you&#x27;ve used Slack for a while. They&#x27;re quite different -- IRC is a protocol for real-time discussion on the internet. Slack is a business tool that incorporates real-time discussion.",1446400744

But most pre-WWII cities do have a belt of railroad/streetcar suburbs to which many of these lessons would apply, though they might need new rail service to truly act on them— Pasadena, Palo Alto, Lakewood, Shaker Heights, Wauwatosa, Columbia Heights, Beaverton, Edmonds, Englewood CO, etc. Places like this are easy to identify— they&#x27;re basically anywhere outside city limits where the streets are laid out on a regular grid.<p>Places like this in growing cities will probably see a lot of development pressure in the coming decades, as young people who desire urban living but who are unable or unwilling to deal with American urban problems seek them out. And many of them were originally built out in 20 years, from 1910-1930, so if zoning is right they could once again rapidly urbanize.",1446400735

I meant that IRC isn&#x27;t foreign or alien to anyone who&#x27;s familiar with chat clients - the basic concept of servers and channels and nicknames is pretty universal.<p>> And just because someone doesn&#x27;t want to spend the time fiddling with IRC bouncers, IRC bots, getting clients to display things nicely doesn&#x27;t mean that they are a bad developer.<p>I feel like I covered this point already:<p>> And ok, if that&#x27;s not fun for you, there are plenty of really &quot;click and install&quot; tools for you (e.g. ZNC is super easy to setup).<p>>  And especially if you don&#x27;t do it all the time, getting people set up to work with Slack is way easier than IRC.<p>What are you referring to here by &quot;getting people setup&quot;? Like a corporate environment? It&#x27;s fairly easy to setup bouncers and the like in a corporate environment using tools like chef, etc. I really don&#x27;t feel like this is a strong argument for a corporate setting.<p>If you mean on a personal level for individual contributors to get up and running on contributing to FOSS, sure it&#x27;s not 100% frictionless - but pretty much. Again, there are lots of bouncers that can be setup with <5 commands.<p>If the argument is that it takes an extra ten minutes to install ZNC vs. Slack, then I dunno - I guess I don&#x27;t see that as very much friction when the tradeoff is using non-free software.<p>> I really find these discussions half amusing and half depressing<p>I feel the same way, but for different reasons. It&#x27;s a little depressing to me how averse people are to spending 10 extra minutes to use FOSS, usually under the guise of &quot;I have different priorities.&quot; I thought developers in the wild would at least be slightly more willing to invest the time, especially post-Snowden, to use FOSS.

Most of what I&#x27;ll be saying here comes from a CMU&#x27;s paper titled &quot;Open vs Closed: A Cautionary Tale&quot;[1] and from Gil Tene&#x27;s talk.<p>First, some terminology which I think is important for the discussion, also when I say &#x27;job&#x27; this could be something like a user, HTTP request, RPC call, network packet, or some sort of task the system is asked to do, and can accomplish in some finite amount of time.<p>Closed-loop system, aka closed system - is a system where new job arrivals are only triggered by job completions, some examples are interactive terminal, batch systems like a CI build system.<p>Open-loop system, aka open system - is a system where new job arrivals are independent of job completions, some examples are the requesting the front page of Hacker news, or arriving packets to a network switch.<p>Partly-open system - is a system where new jobs arrive by some outside process as in an open system, and every time a job completes there is a probability <i>p</i> it makes a follow-up request, or probability <i>(1 - p)</i> it leaves the system. Some examples are web applications, where users request a page, and make follow-up requests, but each user is independent, and new users are arriving and leaving in their own.<p>Second, workload generators (e.g. JMeter, ab, Gatling, etc) can also be classified similarly. Workload generators that issue a request, and then block to wait for a response before making the next request are based on a closed system (e.g. JMeter[2], ab). Those generators that continue to issue requests independently of the response rate, regardless of the system throughput, are based on an open system (e.g. Gatling, wrk2[3])<p>Now, CO happens whenever a workload generator based on a closed system is used against an open system or partly open system, and the throughput of the system under load is slower than the injection rate of the workload generator.<p>For the sake of simplicity, assume we have an open system, say a simple web page, where multiple users arrive by some probability distribution and simply request the page, and then &#x27;leave&#x27;. Assume the arrival probability distribution is uniform, where the <i>p</i> is 1.0 that a request will arrive every second.<p>In this example, if we use a workload generator based on a closed system to simulate this workload for 100 seconds, and the system under load never slows downs so it continuous to serve a response under 1 second, say that is always 500 ms. Then there&#x27;s no CO here. In the end, we will have 100 samples of response times of 500ms, all the statistics (min, max, avg, etc) will be 500ms.<p>Now, say we are using the same workload generator at an injection rate of 1 request/s, but this time the system under load for the first 50 seconds will behave as before with responses taking 500 ms, and for the later 50 seconds the system stalls.<p>Since the system under load is an open system, we should expect 50 samples of response times with 500 ms, and 50 samples where response times linearly decrease from 50s to 1s. The statistics then would be<p>min=500ms, max=50s, avg=13s, median=0.75s, 90%ile=45.05s<p>But because we used a closed system workload generator, our samples are skewed. Instead, we get 50 samples of 500ms and only 1 samples of 50 seconds! This happens because the injection rate is slowed down by the response rate of the system. As you can see this is not even the workload we intended because essentially our workload generator backed off when the system stalled. The stats now look like this:<p>min=500ms, max=50s, avg=1.47s, median=500ms, 90%ile=500ms.<p>[1][pdf] <a href=""http://repository.cmu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1872&context=compsci"" rel=""nofollow"">http://repository.cmu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1872&c...</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://jmeter.512774.n5.nabble.com/Coordinated-Omission-CO-possible-strategies-td5718456.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jmeter.512774.n5.nabble.com/Coordinated-Omission-CO-p...</a>\n[3] <a href=""https://github.com/giltene/wrk2"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/giltene/wrk2</a>",1446399544

If that thinking actually dominated, then you would never have seen the rise of Python, Ruby, Go, Node, Perl, PHP, Scala, Clojure, and so forth during the 2000s and 2010s. During the &#x27;90s, people predicted that Java would be the last programming language that anyone would ever use, using the same kinds of reasoning. That turned out to be false.<p>> You may be swayed toward Rust by the fact that Rust is memory safe. However, when someone comes and tells you that with this open source tool for C++ backed by the big names in C++, and developed and supported by Microsoft, and just by using the GSL types you can get most of the benefit of Rust, you will decide that the delta of improvement of Rust over C++ is not worth it.<p>Replace &quot;Rust&quot; with &quot;Ruby on Rails&quot;, &quot;C++&quot; with &quot;Java&quot;, and &quot;GSL types&quot; with &quot;Spring&quot;, and you could make the same statement in 2005. It might even sound plausible. It would also be an incredibly wrong prediction.<p>> There are already billions of lines of C++ in mission-critical production use.<p>How many lines of <i>memory-safe</i> C++ are there in production use? The amount of memory-safe Rust code far exceeds that.<p>Ergonomics and the ecosystem matter. The fact is that the proposed static analysis tool for C++ is very restrictive and complex, from everything I&#x27;ve seen so far, and coupled with the annotation burden equal to that of Rust effectively makes it into a completely different language.",1446398636

Slack doesn&#x27;t let an organization sunset and delete private chats/DMs after a certain amount of time. When employees think they aren&#x27;t overheard they start to get very frank with each other (which is good, I think frank and direct communication is important). But sometimes they say things that are ignorant or even their frankness can reveal things about the company that are embarrassing. This isn&#x27;t even a theoretical scenario anymore, look no further than dumps from recent hacks.<p>I like Slack&#x27;s default-to team member privacy but you can implement these features without compromising that. I opened a case with Slack about it but they closed it with the standard &quot;consider it in the future&quot; response that I expected (which I don&#x27;t hold against them, I can&#x27;t say I wouldn&#x27;t have done the same). It may take a breach of Slack&#x27;s infrastructure and subsequent leak of private chats for them to make the changes needed for organizations to protect themselves from this.<p>It might only take user education to protect a company from this, but in the end if you&#x27;re a big enough organization there are going to be people that don&#x27;t care, hate the organization or are just to jaded to take the ramifications seriously.",1446398491

Many people who understand classical economics get this wrong [0], because financial markets are a very degenerate kind of market from the point of view of classical economics.<p>The fundamental error in all cases is to conceptualize insider trading as buying <i>from someone who would have bought/sold anyway</i>.  This is precisely failing to think at the margin.  It is as erroneous as saying &quot;eating meat is ok because those cows would have been killed anyway&quot;.  Put more technically, when you buy a share, you do so by shifting up the demand curve a tiny bit, with your demand, which in turn shifts the price slightly up and causes a seller to sell, who would not otherwise have.  Market microstructure, together with the fact that supply/demand curves really form a single curve, can obscure this fundamental economic fact.<p>Given this, insider trading does cause harm to some people.  And how could it not?  If a person can make money from insider trading, then, to first order, someone else must lose money.  There are some externalities from information revelation, but only a tiny fraction of these benefits go to the marginal buyer/seller who lost out because of insider trading.<p>How does this compare to public releases of information?  Well unlike insider trading, public information can shift prices without any transactions occurring (or in practice, very few).  This is because while insider trading only moves the price by the mechanism of moving the supply/demand curve, while public information is revealed to all traders at once.<p>So while insider trading does reveal information (which is a good thing) it does so in a way that reduces liquidity, because people don&#x27;t want to be on the wrong side of insider trading.<p>I&#x27;ll admit that the above narrative isn&#x27;t watertight.  I think it&#x27;s the best analysis that can be done verbally.  The only models that allow a meaningful discussion of welfare in the context of financial markets are so called noise-trader models, which explicitly model the (irrational) reasons why most people trade.  The whole field is vastly complicated by the fact that theory predicts almost no trade in stocks if people were completely rational.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.marketwatch.com/story/why-insider-trading-should-be-legal-2011-05-17"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.marketwatch.com/story/why-insider-trading-should-...</a>",1446397737

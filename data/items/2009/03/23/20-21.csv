A quick look around makes me think you are trying a two-sided sale.  \nFirst side: get users to create a DandyID to use with all the DandyID enabled sites.\nSecond side: get websites to use your API to let all those users who have created a DandyID sign-up to their site more easily.<p>From the users perspective it looks like there is exactly one application - a wordpress plugin - so why should I trust some random site with my credentials?  So I can then install a wordpress plugin of unknown quality on my server?<p>From the website side I would guess after you subtract all your test accounts the number of live DandyIDs is in the dozens.<p>A two sided sale like this is very tough.<p>At first I thought you were offering the ability to look through all the sites you have aggregated (scraped?) by username - that could be useful.  When I saw the need for a DandyID account before the API was useful I realized the API was not very useful.<p>To your original question:  ""Apply for an API key"" is a little off-putting.  If I am cool enough maybe you will give me one?  And when you click on the link:<p><a href=""http://www.dandyid.org/beta/apiprofile"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dandyid.org/beta/apiprofile</a><p>you get this:<p>Whowzers! Lets try that login again.\nYou must be logged in to do that!<p>I guess if I clicked on that signup link, gave up who knows what kind of info, I could then ""Apply"" (oh please, please let me in)<p>but at this point I am gone.<p>You are essentially asking developers to work for you for free.

Are you proposing some sort of law against compensation about a certain point?  Limiting all salaries to $250K per year or something?<p><i>decoupling one's material well-being and lifestyle (somewhat) from one's job position</i><p>Does this also include decoupling one's material well-being from one's output?  To be fair, in the next paragraph you address that saying, ""Obviously, society needs to encourage and reward hard work,"" but who is determining what is hard work in your system?  Is this your personal morality? You've decided that certain labor is worth more than other labor and think society should use your values?<p><i>high-ranking jobs should only be available to those with sufficient experience and knowledge, but the concept of a job title as a reward for previous accomplishments has proven itself to be a practical disaster, in addition to the model's ethical problems.</i><p>Other than previous accomplishments, how else can firms screen people?  This isn't just a CEO thing.  It's pretty much how all labor works in our system. You've been here for x years and so should be earning more.  You did well on project y and so you should get a raise.  You've shown an aptitude for z so we're promoting you.<p>--<p>I'm not trying to tear your argument apart.  It's just that there's a reason why ""radical"" solutions are often not solutions.  Often times they might fix one thing while breaking 10 others.  The problem we have here is that we can't figure out who is good at being a manager (or any sort of employee).  You're arguing for a changed system that doesn't actually address that problem. We still have no idea who to promote.  People will still lie about qualifications because people want to be the boss for power reasons in addition to monetary reasons.  Would you argue that politicians are such better managers because they're in it for the position rather than the money?  I wouldn't say they're inherently worse than business leaders, but I wouldn't say they're a better bunch either.<p>Likewise, we currently value labor based on market offering.  You've suggested a move to the ""hardness"" of the job being the basis of compensation.  What makes a job hard?  Is computer programming harder than teaching?  What about construction work?  It's really subjective.<p>--<p>Clearly there are problems with the system, but you need to address the root of those problems.  How do we accurately measure employee (from the lowest level to the CEO) output value?  How do we screen potential applicants for all jobs accurately?<p>This isn't just a problem at the CEO level.  I've seen programmers that couldn't say what a linked list was, but they got past the screening process and coasted on a salary.  Likewise, there are CEOs that are doing great jobs managing their companies.  This isn't merely a CEO problem, but rather a whole labor problem - it's just more repugnant to us that an incompetent CEO is getting paid millions when compared to an incompetent low-level worker doing nothing.",1237839101

Please, please, <i>please</i> do not use cjson!<p>First, it is unmaintained. The latest version available was posted on August 24, 2007. When you encounter one of its myriad bugs, you'll either have to patch it yourself or pick another JSON library. Just skip the intermediate step and use another library to begin with.<p>Second, it is <i>buggy</i>. In some cases, parsing text it just generated will return a different value from what you passed in! It's almost entirely ignorant of Unicode, and what little it tries to parse it gets wrong.<p>Third, it's exceedingly non-compliant. The text it parses and generates bears only a passing resemblance to JSON. There are varying degrees of conformance to the spec between libraries, based on personal preference of the authors -- I prefer strict conformance, others less strict -- but cjson is <i>so</i> different as to be simply unusable.<p>Yes, it's fast. I know. I wrote jsonlib partly because I was unsatisfied with simplejson's performance, and one goal (never truly achieved) was always to surpass cjson. However, speed isn't everything. As the saying goes, ""if I want my math performed fast and wrong I'll ask my cat"".<p>In my opinion, the <i>only</i> Python JSON libraries worth considering are:<p>* simplejson -- it's in the standard library, and should therefore be considered first and most thoroughly.<p>* jsonlib -- it's fast, well-tested, and standards-compliant.<p>* demjson -- has several options for reliable parsing of invalid input.<p>Last time I checked, jsonlib and simplejson's C extensions are neck-and-neck performance-wise. In some quick, unscientific tests, jsonlib reads faster and simplejson writes faster. However, simplejson's extensions are only used for certain subsets of input -- if you want to use an uncommon feature, performance will degrade. jsonlib has an implementation in pure C, which avoids this problem at the cost of complexity.<p>Apologies for the brain-dump, but even if you skip right over it, please remember: don't use cjson.",1237838596

I'm specifically looking for a way to pull up an HTML document that I've created and see if there are any spelling errors on the page.  I've seen some sites that will parse your page and give you a report, but that seems overly complicated.  I'm looking for something like a bookmarklet or grease script.<p>What methods do you use to spell check pages that have mixed code and content (i.e. web templates)",1237838514

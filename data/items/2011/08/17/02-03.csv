Since he runs the company that extorts about $15 out of every phone Samsung makes, I would not be surprised if he had good information (despite being Ballmer).<p>Let's see how the racket goes now that Google has 17000+ more patents to defend their partners with.<p>I don't think anything like Android ever happened to the mobile space. Symbian was co-owned by Nokia and Sony Ericsson for a while, but was never open-source. I think saying a common Android stack would fail is premature. And my point is that it would survive <i>even if Google tried to kill it</i>, something I doubt will happen.<p>Motorola will, as Google has repeated many times, continue to be an independent company and will have to compete with other Android licensees in order to win preferred partner status. I strongly suspect they won't win frequently (as that would jeopardize the Android ecosystem)",1313549740

There were the billing hours that kept us in business and the after-hours stuff were I really learned stuff. I was single and I spent many hours arguing/practicing/learning from my peers. This was not like the situation described at github. If I consider the billing hours and the other stuff, I generally worked more than 40 hours. But the ""other stuff"" was fun, it was me geeking out. When I was not on assignment I did more of the ""other stuff.""<p>Right now I have a bit of flexibility. I don't force myself to work at a particular time, I find I do much better work if I do so when I feel like doing it. I still have several jobs. I have my full-time job, where I have to work hours. While I'm compensated like I'm full time, I am not 100% scheduled. This gives me time to write, work on the side, watch topgear.<p>That is an interesting challenge. How can a consulting company that bills by the hour not force a schedule? It turns out if you are a body shop, you've unnecessarily coupled your organization to the implementation of the customer. While that may be common, that doesn't make the ""right"" or ""best"", it's just the shit companies do.<p>I hope you guys manage to find the right size that lets you keep this culture.

OpenMP or just plain ol' pthreads are dominant for shared-memory parallelism. That's partly because in the HPC community, data parallelism dominates, not task parallelism. Can you point to the study? I'd like to see who they surveyed, what they asked and just what their general methodology was.<p>Also, from what I was able to find out about RapidMind, their product was a combination of library and compiler support - but I was never able to get a good grasp of what exactly they did. They were rather secretive. But my understanding is that it's not accurate to describe ArBB as a ""library.""

I wanted to take this opportunity to make a blog post about the situation and post some information from our side of the fence. Before I begin though, Id like to thank the tens of people who felt the need to e-mail us death threats and general profanity. We have forwarded these on to your ISPs abuse departments.<p>Yesterday on Twitter we were asked by a user why their friends account was suspended because of a PayPal dispute. Our terms and conditions are very clear that in the case of any PayPal disputes, or other payment disputes, all services are suspended until the dispute is closed and the payment issue(s) resolved. These are typical terms that most web hosting providers have, and in some cases a provider will even charge a fee to restore any accounts that have been suspended because of a payment dispute. We dont, for the record.<p>So, when asked why their friends account was suspended we told them Our terms are very clear. Your friend should not have opened a fraudulent dispute. We then sent a DM to the individual who asked, saying the following: Please mind your own business. Your friends account, and PayPal dispute has nothing to do with you. Of course, as a hosting provider we cannot discuss the details of another account and its status with others. Because of this message, we were informed that they would be canceling their accounts due to our unprofessional-ism. After much continued pushing from these users, we then responded (rather sarcastically I might add) with the following: Fantastic. Perhaps you can sign up with a hosting provider who doesnt take privacy seriously then. Enjoy.<p>We take privacy very seriously. If your friend has an issue with their account, your friend needs to contact us. Despite being your friend, it does not mean we will discuss their account(s) with you and it does not entitle you to demand information about a specific issue or incident. Your friends account is theirs, and theirs alone.<p>So, cue more pushing and baiting on Twitter and we then come to the conclusion that this situation is obviously some attempt for these users to attack us for reasons unknown, and we decide to end our business relationship with them. What this effectively means is that we decide to suspend their account(s) and offer them a full backup of their data with us. Of the two users we did this for, one of them was extremely polite and requested a backup of their data, which we provided to them. This user also had domains in their account which they still have full access to, and we even informed them via e-mail that they should transfer them to another provider as soon as possible as we would no longer be providing support to them.<p>The other posted on Twitter that they were looking for another hosting provider, to which we responded Best of luck with your new host!. This was not intended to be a taunt, this was intended to be the closing line to our discussion with them. Our way of saying OK, best of luck, we consider this matter closed now. Unfortunately, this user interpreted it to be a taunt or goad. They then responded with direct profanity aimed at us. At this point before the profanity Id like to state that their account was only suspended. They had full access to a backup of their data and files.<p>After the profanity (which was completely unnecessary) we terminated the account immediately, no longer wishing to do any form of business or communication with the client. As part of our termination system, any backups we store for an account are automatically removed via an action hook we have deployed. We dont see any logic in storing data for terminated accounts that we no longer host, so they are removed instantly. Please note; this wasnt a manual Oh Im going to remove your backups because you swore at me! situation. This was an automated process that occurs immediately after any account on our servers is terminated.<p>So lets just recap a little; we have 1 account that is suspended with full access to a backup of their data and their domain names. We have another account that is fully terminated, with all data removed, due to severe breach of our terms.<p>And then we have the Twitter/Reddit aftermath.<p>Now, I fully understand how as a customer or potential customer, a hosting provider terminating your account and deleting your data without notice is a bad thing. Hell, if it happened to me Id be very angry indeed. But what you have to remember is that this isnt a typical situation, and certainly isnt a random event. This is the direct result of publically swearing at and abusing your hosting provider, something which is actually covered in our Acceptable Usage Policy and results in instant account termination. Please also remember that before the termination, the customer was able to obtain all of their data in the way of a backup should they have requested it. The moment they decided to cross that line and become abusive in that manner, they made a conscious choice to break our terms and the result is the enforcement of that. The other friend who didnt decide to abuse us? They still have full access to their data and domains, and are presumably looking for a new host.<p>Im not saying were right and the users were wrong. Im not saying that perhaps some other hosting providers wouldve dealt with the suspension(s) and termination differently, to each their own. What you need to discern is that this is an extremely rare situation. Our terms and conditions were broken, something that very rarely happens, but when it does the outcome is always the same. These are our policies and these are how we respond. Many of you wont know because quite frankly, youll never break our terms  which is precisely the issue here. Ridicule us for it if you will.",1313547897

After months of patience, including offers to let them pay off the debt over time I went to a collection agency and got the lot back in a court settlement less $1k in fees for the agency (which at least was tax deductable).<p>I should mention that this was in Australia and I had a pretty solid contract. So this may not apply to you, but the debt collector took the hassle out of chasing it up and I didn't have to get involved in the court proceedings. It might be worth a look.<p>For anyone who's contracting I'd recommend a few things:<p>1. Always have a contract and make sure you get advice before you sign it.<p>2. Don't be afraid to change or negotiate terms if you need to. Look out for excessive IP restrictions and restraint of trade clauses.<p>3. If you're doing per-diem work, get signed weekly timesheets. They're a legal record of work done.<p>4. If you're building a product for a fixed price, contractually define milestone payments and ideally get a partial payment up front.<p>5.

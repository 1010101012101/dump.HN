For storage, that is ridiculous. It&#x27;s not like they&#x27;re going to start running ads in the paper for &quot;Unit J-14, a 5x8 walkup&quot;. I&#x27;ve rented numerous storage units in numerous states, and I&#x27;ve never been charged more than the last complete month. (So OK, maybe I&#x27;ve been screwed out of 29 days, but I understand they don&#x27;t want to mess with billing cycles or proration.) Also, I&#x27;ve never gone into a storage place and found any size I wanted unavailable. These places don&#x27;t want to leave money on the table, so if they start filling up they either raise prices or build more units. If you never fill up, 90 days notice is ridiculous.",1374976796

I remember plenty of blog posts about Go popping up a few years claiming that it was unusable due to the lack of generics, mainly stemming from on a lack of familiarity with the language.<p>The main reason to use Coffeescript is in place of Javascript, which already has plenty of warts to avoid, many more serious that this issue, and many of which Coffeescript helps to alleviate. If time spent on something is important to you, Coffeescript can help save a great deal through it&#x27;s expressiveness, especially in areas where vanilla JS is awkward (eg. OOP).<p>Personally, with relation to the scoping issue, I tend towards using Underscore&#x27;s higher-order iteration functions (each, map, reduce, etc.) in most cases instead of Coffeescript&#x27;s `for`, which eliminates this issue entirely due to the scoping of the anonymous functions passed to them.",1374976594

Uh, big deal?<p>The chunk of what&#x27;s important isn&#x27;t explained at all:<p>- runtime/ takes care of memory management quite efficiently with a decent tracing gc in runtime/mgc0.c.  I haven&#x27;t benchmarked it against other stop-the-world collectors, but it should be no match for truly concurrent gc.<p>- runtime/proc.c schedules various blocking and non-blocking (called netpoll, which resolves to epoll on systems where it is available) calls.  It seems to account for number of cores and use native threads, but I&#x27;m not sure how it interacts with the Linux scheduler.<p>- runtime/malloc.goc is the core memory allocator/deallocator.

However, in every case except <i>S aureus</i>, infection is basically unheard of when an individual has a functioning immune system; they are all opportunistic pathogens. This is a part of the problem: a healthy individual can carry a dangerous strain around with no idea of the risk they present to the immunodeficient.<p>So what is to be done with the immunocompromised?

When I do, I fully intend to walk into the office, hand them the key, and point out that I never signed the document and will fight any attempts to charge me the next three months worth of rent.<p>Like most people, I usually just blindly click through EULA&#x27;s and sign whatever documents wherever somebody tells me to but in this case not doing so paid off.

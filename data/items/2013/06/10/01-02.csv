Nations such as Italy, Germany, the Netherlands, Czecheslovakia (since rendered into the states of Slovakia and the Czech Republic), much of the Balkans and Baltic countries, etc., simply <i>didn&#x27;t exist</i> as national entities at the beginning of the 19th Century.  Neither did the states of the Middle East (Ottoman Empire), Africa (colonies, prior to which:  native tribal regions not structured as we&#x27;d consider modern nations), the Americas, etc.<p>Yes, you&#x27;ll find England, Spain, and France in much their modern form dating to ~ 1000 - 1400 AD, but only just.<p>There <i>are</i> a few modern countries which have occupied much the same area (though with different governmental forms) more or less continuously:  Persia/Iran, Vietnam, Japan, and China, with as I recall Vietnam being the oldest as I recall.<p>But no, &quot;nations&quot; as such really aren&#x27;t all that permanent.",1370829578

The idea of only giving you a &quot;MUST&quot; after finishing the current &quot;WANT&quot; is that you&#x27;ll have to take a break from work, before you can start with it again.<p>Another reason for doing this is that it would be quite unfair to give you a &#x27;work&#x27; item when you don&#x27;t feel like the &#x27;play&#x27; suggestion it&#x27;s making and just want to relax with something else - it would defeat the point of the &#x27;play&#x27; part, and would make you afraid of clicking &quot;something else&quot;, because it might come up with a &#x27;work&#x27; item.

If you are radicalized, they kill you for it, and then life for everyone else carries on as it was, then for me that is not a win.  That is beyond any doubt a loss, and I consider opting to do that rather than sacrifice non-violence for a hope at enacting change that others can appreciate to be a selfish act.<p>Nonviolence is not a goal for me.  I consider it a tool with limited application.  Failing to build a doghouse with a hammer, instead of successfully building the doghouse with a screwdrivers, is nothing to be proud of.

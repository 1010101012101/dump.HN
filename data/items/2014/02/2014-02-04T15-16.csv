7178224,comment,7177867,7177867,2,0,mjmahone17,,,"24m by 2035 doesn&#x27;t actually sound like that much. And the fact that most of the new cases will be coming from the developed world seems to speak more to the fact that life expectancy and pollution (due to development) in the developed world is increasing, meaning people are living longer, in more hazardous conditions, and are therefore more likely to get cancer.<p>There really doesn&#x27;t seem to be anything to be alarmed about. There will be about 73million deaths in 2035 (looking at current death rates vs. expected world population). If everyone who gets cancer dies from it in a year, there will be 24m deaths due to it, although <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_survival_rates"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_survival_rates</a> indicates that cancer seems to have a >70% survival rate, in general. In 20 years, it&#x27;s likely that survival rate will also be reflected in developing countries. So really, only about 7.2m, or about 10%, of our mortality will likely be due to cancer. That&#x27;s still a lot, and it&#x27;s worthwhile to try to prevent as many of those deaths as possible. But cancer seems like it&#x27;s not, statistically, our biggest threat.",1391529581

That may change but living long enough to die from cancer is, sadly, the grand prize in life.&quot;<p>I kind of see your point but you seem to be forgetting about the children who die from cancer. Not to mention the types of cancer that are more common in younger people (e.g. testicular cancer). In the past living long enough to bear children may have been considered a good thing - you didn&#x27;t die from an infection we had no cure for. The people who die from the disease probably don&#x27;t see it the same way and I doubt you would either. Even though I understand your premise if I got cancer even in my 90&#x27;s I wouldn&#x27;t be thinking: &quot;Wow, look how long I lived&quot;, I&#x27;d be thinking, &quot;Shit, I have cancer&quot;.",1391529108

7178093,comment,7177388,7177785,11,0,moron4hire,,,"Full disclosure: my mother and my sister both work in fundraising. I&#x27;ve also done some freelancing for university fundraising departments.<p>80% is pretty good in the fundraising industry. Usually it&#x27;s closer to 90%. Don&#x27;t ever do one of those &quot;text 12345 to donate to hurricane victims in the tropics&quot; sort of thing, the returns on those are abysmal. But really, what do you expect? People doing work have to get paid. Most of the fuel in a rocket is for getting the rest of the fuel in the rocket off the ground.<p>One of the ways that fundraising departments try to keep the costs down is to use volunteer work (i.e., a form of donation of time) and internships to do the grunt work of calling people on the phone. Nobody expects those college kids to stay in those internships for their entire careers. Usually, they&#x27;re only there for the &quot;busy season&quot;, the end of the year where people rush to get donations in to count towards their tax writeoffs. For many of the kids, it&#x27;s either that or a completely unpaid internship in advertising.<p>And government is actually a lot worse. In the US, only about 55% of your tax dollar goes towards social services. Then you have to take the admin percentage off the top of <i>that</i>. To beat an 80% number like the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, they&#x27;d have to keep overhead down to less than 64%. That&#x27;s so absurdly low that I can&#x27;t imagine it is possible.<p>My comment in my original post refers to the fact that every charity in the US is required to spend a certain percentage of their endowment every year. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has a HUGE endowment. They have to spend so much that they can&#x27;t find enough outlets for it. They have to fund projects that aren&#x27;t necessarily part of their core goals because they can&#x27;t fund their core goals anymore.<p>And the snarky comment about Al Qaeda is a commentary on the nature of Al Qaeda, they are not a single organization that operates above the board, they are themselves more of a foundation and loose conglomeration of various groups for mutual benefit. But the way our government casts it, if you help any organization that has any ties to Al Qaeda, then you are helping The Al Qaeda Man Who Is A Single Person Who 9/11 9/11 9/11.<p>So, when you have more money then you literally know what to do with, just tossing it around makes it very easy to hit Al Qaeda.",1391528608

7178076,comment,7177147,7177147,11,0,jeroen94704,,,"A slight elaboration about the way your eye works: The cones are not on-off affairs, and they are not limited to specific wavelengths. Each type of cone has a response curve, and these curves overlap (see e.g. the Wikipedia article about Cone cells: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cone_cell"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cone_cell</a> ). So different colors are not really &quot;made up&quot; by filling in the gaps between the wavelengths. Each color we see corresponds to a specific cone response pattern. So for example, 500 nm would lead to responses of (roughly) 0.3, 0.4, 0.1.<p>This means the explanation here is slightly misleading, as it compares yellow (which is a color that does exist as a single wavelength) with magenta, which is by definition a mix of at least two wavelengths.<p>You could say that magenta is a compound color, the interpretation by our brain of the simultaneous stimulation by at least two wavelengths (i.e. two or more cone response patterns). This means, of course, that magenta is far from the only color for which this is true. Any combination of at least two wavelengths is a compound color, and the interpretation of each of these combinations will not be found on the visible spectrum.<p>So, interesting article, but a bit oversimplified, in my view.",1391528457

Generally I aim to be in the last 3rd of people boarding.<p>There are also budget airlines that don&#x27;t offer reserved seating (e.g. EasyJet and Ryanair in Europe - I think, I don&#x27;t fly these airlines though), so priority boarding on them allows you to chose a seat, or to ensure you sit next to whoever you&#x27;re traveling with.",1391528070

I hardly ever watch movies and when I do, I go to the cinema, because I don&#x27;t like storing use-once junk in my apartment. Try to put it in perspective of 2% of income - in US most people can accept $85 broadband but hardly a $85 DVD, even if they are earning much more than average. I would be considered an idiot with too much money to spend if I bought them for myself. The only DVDs I have seen anywhere were gifts, as they are easy to pick and fit in boxes well.<p>The only reason why broadband may cost that much is because it&#x27;s localized and one can&#x27;t simply buy EU broadband in US. There are actually good reasons for broadband prices to be affected by local economy, since labour and materials may have different cost there. That&#x27;s not the case with DVDs, which cost the same (pennies) to manufacture.<p>But maybe I should have put more emphasis on the problems with availability rather than money. Having a choice of spending my $20 on cinema tickets or a DVD, sometimes I would choose latter to watch something at home. But here DVDs are released only when the dubbing is ready, often after a year from the original release. I could get to this content earlier online, but I don&#x27;t have Netflix here, nor Play Movies, Pandora and many others. There were problems with DVD releases that were solved in two ways: by VOD with reasonable monthly fee or by torrents. Saying torrents are for the greedy is just a good excuse to prosecute piracy instead of improving the market.",1391526799

I dont understand what you mean. The goverment should defnetly not do things that cause market failure, and in my opinion the should do things against it either.<p>> Saying that collusion can lead to market failure, and thus must be proscribed if one wishes to have an efficient market, is not propaganda.<p>My point was to say that, its propaganda to say that free market people dont belive in market failure, nothing else.<p>> It is the kind of thing that must be said, seemingly repeatedly, to illustrate the point that markets are not a magical solution to the allocation problem.<p>Again, nobody is arguing for &quot;perfect markets&quot;. This is what seemingly repeatedly has to be said.<p>> However, moving from that to suggest that imposing controls such as anti-collusion regulations (along with a whole host of other measures to avoid market failure), is unnecessary, is unsubstantiated<p>No it is not. Also you only addressed the first part of my argument. Its hard to argue the general case here, there is tons of litrature showing how for example anti-trust regulation was used to keep prices high. There are tons of cases where goverment was used to enforce cartels as well.<p>So if the goverment task of managing cartels would not exists then there might be less cartels overall.<p>> The foundation for why one might think that what you are saying is true (market theory) explicitly lays out the assumptions required for it to work, and you ignore these on a purely ideological basis.<p>You might be surprised but there no just the walrasian standard model (or Arrow–Debreu). Also just because the make these assumition and the need to be true in there model does not mean that it is the same for the real world. You are assuming that the standard model used in econ 101 is reality.<p>Well it is not, and everybody who studied economics a bit knows this. You need to bring in transaction costs, theory of the firm, information economics, you need to bring in instiutional economics, there needs to be a explaition market ajustment and so on. Also you need to model politcal economy, are you really so naive to assume that the correction of market failure is also just like in these models. A completly costless third party that only ever does anything when the model goes out of balance, interduce politcal economy into the mix, try modeling &#x27;goverment failure&#x27; as well.<p>Again, I feel I have to say this again, I do not make the argument that a market always is or always reaches generall equillibrum very fast(as in Arrow-Debreu). The simple idea that you seam to have is that any diffrence between Arrow-Debreu assumtions and the real world must be corrected is not woreable in practice, and I belive no economist would still try this.",1391526755

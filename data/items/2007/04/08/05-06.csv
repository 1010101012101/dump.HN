You never have to patch web apps. And you are automatically connected through the client-server paragidm that proved to be so wonderful before desktops ever came about.<p>Remember, dumb terminals were around long before PCs.",1176011078

10332,comment,10034,10300,0,0,gibsonf1,,,":)  <p>My experience with graphic design is mainly in the traditional realm, not on the web. I never claimed to have the ultimate typography on my website. (To give you an idea of my age, I programmed a BBS in basic on a commodore 64 ""Moondog BBS"" in 1982 - I was a Junior in HS.)  However, the site was cutting edge when I first had it on in 1995 and was published a few years in a row in the book _Design Portfolio_ with interviews, etc. in the late 90's.  <p>My site has been neglected as I've been too busy (too many projects, etc.), but the thrust of the site is the imagery and design and ideas, not the fonts.  That is the value people get from the site and why it is so heavily linked and visited.  I am definitely looking forward to having the site totally automated and database driven so that I can control the look and feel globally (the site is huge if you noticed) and have it always up to date finally later in the year.<p>But to take it off because of imperfect fonts and frames etc. would be foolish.  I would be denying the value that so many people are getting from the site in its current crippled form.   But thank you for the concern :)<p>",1176010535

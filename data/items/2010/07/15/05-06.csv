If they pay 500k less, that's 500k less the other pension fund doesn't get.  No value is created or destroyed by people trading at marginally wrong prices.  Furthermore, as long as it's the same people trading with each other at randomly wrong prices, things even out in the wash.  These days though, you're dealing with PhDs doing nothing but programming computers to trade, and extracting the money from these mistakes.  This makes it not even out in the wash anymore, and they're being paid billions of dollars to solve a problem that never existed.  I would much rather have those PhDs figure out how to program a computer to make an electric car that is 5% more efficient, or a wind turbine that is 5% more efficient, or a search engine that is 5% more accurate, or even figure out how to make a physical constant known to 5% greater accuracy.  All of those things increase the total value in the world.  Instead, they're all being siphoned off by trading companies to do things that make them money, but don't create much if any value.",1279173518

Pretty much every idea ever that can be written as software has been patented at this point. Any code you write is probably violating some fucking patent, and if you're making money from software you write, it's only a matter of time before the patent trolls come knocking. It absolutely disgusts me. Maybe I'll move to NZ. I'm really impressed by this, seriously.",1279173445

1517064,comment,1516710,1516710,0,0,grellas,,,"The article notes an unexpected by-product of the U.S. Supreme Court's <i>Bilski</i> decision: apparently, it has caused examiners to become more aggressive in rejecting software patents that represent purely abstract ideas. Of course, the line between what constitutes patentable ""method"" and unpatentable ""idea"" is murky. Nonetheless, before <i>Bilski</i>, the governing rule was pretty much that any method can be patented if it leads to a ""useful, concrete, and tangible result,"" a highly liberal standard first adopted by the Federal Circuit in its <i>State Street</i> decision in 1998. <i>State Street</i> had opened the floodgates to unprecedented grants of software patents, both in number and in looseness of quality. It was precisely this idiotic outpouring of dubious patents that the Federal Circuit court itself tried to stem when it adopted the highly arbitrary ""machine or transformation"" test that was ultimately rejected by the Supreme Court on further appeal in <i>Bilski</i>. Though the Supreme Court rejected the machine-or-transformation test as a definitive standard for patentability of methods and also specifically affirmed the patentability of methods, it pointedly <i>rejected</i> the ultra-loose <i>State Street</i> test while stating that machine-or-transformation <i>can</i> be used to provide an important ""clue"" to patentability, thus signaling that the USPTO and the courts were to be much stricter in evaluating method patents in the future. In addition, four justices (in dissent) would have struck down method patents altogether. Taken all together, then, the <i>Bilski</i> case has begun to rein in the worst abuses in this area, even if the rejections now rest on calling out a method as being a mere abstract idea.<p>This all may be cold comfort to those who despise the effects of software patents but it is a significant step forward in reality to help prevent abuses. And, of course, the ultimate corrective in this area for all the mistakes made since <i>State Street</i> is that such patents will in time enter into the prior art. This does not help anyone today, or for the near future, but it does mean that between a stricter standard going forward and the eventual lapse of the more frivolous patents previously granted, sanity is likely to be restored to this area over time.<p>Of course, for the short term, the abuses will remain as a carryover from the last 12 years and there is not much that can be done about this short of congressional action redefining what constitutes patentable subject matter. Since such action is nowhere near occurring, the U.S. will likely remain a treacherous terrain for companies in the software patent area for some years to come (and that would include New Zealand companies trying to ship their products here).",1279173141

1517040,comment,1516728,1516728,0,0,todayiamme,,,"Something that bothers me whenever something like this comes up is that children are assumed to be one dimensional beings. I know for sure that at some level, be it proprioception or some difference in processing information, male and female brains are different. However, the catch is that those differences may not actually be that profound.<p>Children as young as 3 can pick up gender cues from the environment and base their behavior on that. I know that I did. I just knew that I couldn't play with dolls. I knew I couldn't talk about babies and things like that. I knew I was expected to pick fights with other kids. I knew what my parents expected from me, and in order to seek their approval I did precisely that.<p>There are so many subtle societal cues which govern behavior. You tend to only notice them when you are carefully paying attention constantly. They are undertones in conversations. It is how people look at you. It is what they first talk about. It is in their facial expressions, and somehow unconsciously we internalize them all.<p>What is even more interesting is what happens when a child is gender variant. Societies response to such a child happens to be quite telling, and unfortunately for a child, at least, such things matter. It mattered to me and it matters for any child. At that age approval is everything.<p>So is it surprising that more women don't go into tech?<p>In the coming years when this generation grows up in an environment of different expectations and viewpoints.

It's really only when they're multiplied together that it becomes so starkly biased towards males.<p>My long standing theory on the tech front has been that the hook in the 80s and early 90s for kids getting into technology was computer games, which were largely marketed to boys.<p>My little sister, however, was born in 1988, and by the time she was using a computer the primary hook was the internet, which (as I recall) young girls spend <i>more</i> time on than young boys.<p>Like I had, she learned to program at a young age, knew HTML when she was 11, Java when she was 14, and so on.  However, also like me, she had a lot of aptitude for music.<p>I was <i>fiercely</i> discouraged from music.  My parents saw it as a waste of time.  Becoming a software engineer was respectable.  Heck, I started college in 1997 when it seemed like about the best thing in the universe that a kid could go into.<p>Now, my sister was encouraged in music.  My mom moved 90 miles away so that she could go to a magnet high school for performing arts, my parents bought her a $3000 flute and drove her around the country to top conservatories for auditions when the time came.  But even up to her senior year in high school she was considering a double major in physics and music, but the interest in physics was largely downplayed by my parents.<p>Now, what happened there?  Two kids, both good at mathematical stuff and music, same parents, <i>wildly</i> different parenting approaches.  I don't think my parents in the meantime considered music any more <i>useful</i> â€“ it was simply acceptable that she do something <i>useless</i>, while I had to do something useful.  I think you see where this is going.<p>In college I noticed this again â€“ the computer science department was about 95% male, while the math department was only 50% male.  The difference obviously wasn't in analytical abilities â€“ I think anybody that could get through a math degree could get through a CS degree.  No, the difference was that almost all of the girls were minoring in education and intending to become math teachers.<p>I don't think that <i>everything</i> in the gap is nurture; there's probably some truth to chest-beating nature of starting a company, but the scales certainly are tipped heavily in the direction of boys by our upbringing.",1279171940

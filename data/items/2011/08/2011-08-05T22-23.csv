It is also a well-written and easy to read book. The main takeaway is that our situation is not a problem with a solution, but rather a predicament or situation with various coping mechanisms.<p><a href=""http://www.newsociety.com/Books/L/The-Long-Descent"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newsociety.com/Books/L/The-Long-Descent</a>",1312585174

All of those factory and middle management jobs are being replaced by cheaper labor in the one case (offshore or robotics) or by technological and communication efficiencies on the other.<p>A prediction:\nTwenty years from now, there will only be two types of jobs in the United States: Creatives and those in the Service Industry.<p>Creatives - anyone who creates things with their mind.  Artists, yes, but also programmers, designers (graphic/web/product), musicians, directors, etc.  The US won't necessarily have a monopoly in this department, but there's enough cultural barriers in many of these fields that it's likely we'll still have a very healthy presence there, at least for selling to the Western world.<p>Everyone else will be in the service industry - and I'm referring to service jobs that cannot be outsourced, because they require someone local.  Waiters, barbers, chefs, trainers, couriers.  Nurses and caregivers.  And lots of service jobs that don't exist today.  Need someone to help assemble the product you just downloaded and 3d printed?<p>The only jobs that will remain are the ones that we can't outsource to robots or cheap labor.",1312585173

Looking at what I can find on Google books (I don’t have the book here), we have that historically the unemployment rate rises an average of %7 and that this lasts 4 years. Output falls more than 9 percent, but that down turn only lasts 2 years. So yes, a jobless recovery is what we should expect.<p>From their summary on pp. 224 [1] that on average:<p>-\tHousing prices decline %35 over 6 years.\n-\tEquity collapses %56 over about 3.5 years\n-\tUnemployment rises %7; down phases lasts 4 years\n-\tOutput falls %9, downturn lasts 2 years.\n-\tGovernment debt rises %86. The main cause is not the bailout but from the collapse in tax revenues.\n-\tFrequent spike in government borrowing rates.<p>So I would say we are not living anything unexpected.<p>[1] <a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=Iihe6s0XincC&lpg=PP1&dq=this%20time%20is%20different&pg=PA225#v=onepage&q=unemployment%20&f=false"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.com/books?id=Iihe6s0XincC&lpg=PP1&#3...</a>",1312585037

2852142,comment,2851444,2852087,1,0,davidtyleryork,,,"I don't think it's ""blogspam"" to educate the developer community about this opportunity. Betable is basically a hack for both the gaming and gambling industries. It hacks the gambling industry by letting new players easily enter the space to spark innovation, and it hacks the gaming industry by giving small developers a monetization channel that makes MUCH more money per player.<p>This is huge for game developers because they can afford to build their games faster and market more aggressively if they use real-money play vs. virtual goods. In our article, we mention that it takes a million users at an ARPU of $1 to make $1M in revenue. Many gambling games have an ARPU of $70-$100, so even if you fall in between $1 and $100 and hit, for instance, $10 ARPU, you are talking about an order of magnitude increase in your revenue per player. The flexibility that this will award game developers is awesome, and we think worthy of a post here.<p>Also, we believe that the best new games that will build on this will combine the best aspect of social games (as we know them) and gambling mechanics. These games will be a merger of the two: Social Gambling Games.",1312584968

OSHA regulations, Social Security, Medicare, health insurance, unions, and many other factors go into the cost of an American worker.  I don't know much about China or India but I doubt they have any of these things.  So, are they important? If they are, why are we ok with importing goods made by people without the same protections, in order to save a few bucks?  If they're not important, maybe we should eliminate them, so we can compete in the global marketplace.",1312584692

2852128,comment,2851470,2851797,6,0,gvb,,,"""Our new economy is shrinking because technology leads to efficiency over growth.""<p>I disagree with this premise.  IMHO, it is much simpler: we as individuals lived beyond our means for 20+ years by borrowing money against our houses and against our personal word (e.g. credit cards).  We as governments lived beyond our means in terms of direct spending as well future spending promises (e.g. promising retirement/pension/medical benefits that are funded by borrowing or not funded at all).  Big companies also promised retirement (pension) benefits that assumed a continuing growth of the investments that backed the pensions - that didn't work out so well.<p>""But why now, when it hasn't in the past?""<p>In the past, we relied on general growth exceeding our indebtedness, ""growing"" our way out of our debt.  This is a game that cannot go on forever... and the longer it goes on, the worse the crash will be at the end.  Right now, it is looking pretty tough.<p>In short, we lived beyond our means for 20+ years.  We will have to live ""below our means"" for a substantial number of years to balance our past spending against our current and future incomes... and that assumes we have the will to make the hard decisions to truly reduce our spending rather than claiming to reduce spending, but the ""reductions"" are 2/5/10 years in the future.<p>A big part of living ""below our means"" is buying less, paying down our debt, which means lower demand and thus lower job levels.",1312584659

2852125,comment,2851470,2852010,5,0,dxbydt,,,"> we've been through this many times before<p>'past predicts future' is not exactly commensurate with a point of inflection. perhaps a real-life example can help - a medical transcription firm in India hires 25 Indians to transcribe medical records. I then sell the CEO a copy of voice recognition software. He is so happy with the results, he fires 24 and keeps 1 Indian to fix the occasional transcription typos! After one month, he finds the transcription error rate is unacceptably high, so he hires one more Indian to fix typos. For the past 1 year, these 2 Indians & that software has chugged along, making money. Now that CEO is happy, making money, and has opened his second office in India, with another copy of the software & just 2 more Indians to babysit and bugfix! True story. Any way you cut it, that's net job loss. First, a bunch of housewives in Atlanta who transcribed for a living lost their livelihood, but you can rationalize that by saying, hey atleast 25 Indians got hired. But 23 out of those 25 Indians lost jobs & 1 piece of software ended up doing the job! Now unless the Atlanta housewives and the 23 Indians end up working for the voice recognition software company ( a very remote possibility ) or end up in a brand new job ( even more remote possibility ) given their limited skills, there is definitely a block of time when there is net job loss.\nOfcourse eventually some of these people will learn new skills and/or are absorbed into new jobs etc...atleast, that's the hope. But the intervening reality can't be wished away. I still think this story will have a happy ending, but so far I don't see it.",1312584630

And there lies the rub.  Perhaps net total jobs is still on the rise, but the rate of population growth is that much faster than the rate of jobs created.  And it's not flat rates, but changing rates as well.  When technology provides efficiency (I'm thinking scale, atm), it would probably push rate of jobs create slightly lower.  With more people on the planet, instead of competing with 1 other person for 1 spot, a person might be competing with 10 other people for 2 spots, hence the sense of joblessness, and a culprit to blame.",1312583777

Warning, if your probabilities are extreme enough, someone might want to bet you on it.<p>Presuming things are different, I see five obvious answers to the original question (and ""all of the above"" is also an option).<p>1)  The amount of regulation and regulatory burden has increased sufficiently between then and now, that new business relationships have a much harder time replacing old destroyed business relationships.  I.e., it's now more expensive to hire a new employee.<p>2)  It's a novel change in the financial side of the economy.  Like, capital-holders now try to make killings by investing in the right HFT funds instead of trying to go out and invest in new businesses.  Implausible?  Maybe, but finance <i>has</i> changed a lot recently, so the difference, if there is one, might be there.<p>3)  The amount of re-education required to get a new job has increased enough to be a killer barrier to re-employment, whether because of employers having imposed an arbitrary demand for bachelors' degrees or because the jobs are actually more complex.<p>4)  Ricardo's Law does allow individual regions to lose as a result of tech improvements, because if someone else beats your comparative advantage, people will want to trade with them instead of you.  There's nothing ahistorical about the Rust Belt having a persistent recession within the US.  This is now happening to the whole US; people no longer want to trade with us, but China is growing plenty.<p>5)  The Thiel hypothesis:  Recent technological developments are intrinsically more boring than past technological developments; people are trying to build web apps that will sell to Google for $10 million instead of trying to invent the next ""microchip"" or ""electricity"".  It's not that the 21st century poses a novel obstacle to forming new business relationships to replace old ones; rather, 21st-century technologies that obsolete jobs are missing a wow factor or wealth-generating factor that previously increased demand or increased total wealth at the same time as obsoleting jobs.",1312583513

My point throughout this discussion is (and I guess it's way off topic for this site...) that 'martial arts' have had their time in the context of systems who claim to contain or teach effective fighting. They're OK as systems of ritualized techniques to be practiced recreationally, but have been proven as in the best cases inefficient and in the worst cases wrong when it comes to teaching practical skills.<p>The early UFC fights (for all their faults) did show conclusively (at least, I don't really see how to explain it differently, nor have I ever heard anyone doing so) that one-sided training and a reliance on stylized movement are inferior, even when deployed by top practitioners, against techniques that were trained and developed in circumstances that mimic 'real' fights more closely.

There's a simple, plausible explanation for all of this:<p>1. Businesses are hesitant to invest in capital.<p>2. The housing market is terrible right now--especially housing starts.<p>3. Jobs related to #2 and #3 generally go to lower-skilled workers. They're the ones who are struggling right now (with something like 16% unemployment for men without a HS diploma).<p>This isn't the end of the American economy, people.

It's unclear what new class of jobs would fully compensate for the loss of, say, many unskilled labor jobs to automation.<p>A second answer might be that we're only now fully realizing the effects of globalization -- outsourcing, moving factories to China, call centers to India, etc... due to the advances in telecommunications and whatnot.

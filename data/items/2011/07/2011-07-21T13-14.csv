With so much money (and aside from the point that they invest a lot in their products), it's a wonder why they don't work on innovating products to help struggling nations.

If this sacking is a step towards finally dealing with those issues, then Twitter Inc. will only be stronger. If its just some part of a power play or structural re-alignment, then I fear that Twitter may be at risk of losing the plot.

article clearly seem to be directed at Anonymous and Lulz Security, and we are 
happy to provide you with a response.<p>You state:<p><pre><code>  ""We want to send a message that chaos on the Internet is unacceptable, 
  [even if] hackers can be believed to have social causes, it's entirely 
  unacceptable to break into websites and commit unlawful acts.""
</code></pre>
Now let us be clear here, Mr. Chabinsky, while we understand that you and
your colleagues may find breaking into websites unacceptable, let us tell
you what WE find unacceptable:<p>* Governments lying to their citizens and inducing fear and terror to keep
   them in control by dismantling their freedom piece by piece.<p>* Corporations aiding and conspiring with said governments while taking
   advantage at the same time by collecting billions of funds for 
   federal contracts we all know they can't fulfil.<p>* Lobby conglomerates who only follow their agenda to push the profits 
   higher, while at the same time being deeply involved in governments around
   the world with the only goal to infiltrate and corrupt them enough 
   so the status quo will never change.<p>These governments and corporations are our enemy. And we will continue to
fight them, with all methods we have at our disposal, and that certainly
includes breaking into their websites and exposing their lies.<p>We are not scared any more. Your threats to arrest us are meaningless to 
us as you cannot arrest an idea. Any attempt to do so will make your 
citizens more angry until they will roar in one gigantic choir. It is our 
mission to help these people and there is nothing - absolutely nothing - you 
can possibly to do make us stop.<p><pre><code>  ""The Internet has become so important to so many people that we have to 
  ensure that the World Wide Web does not become the Wild Wild West.""
</code></pre>
Let me ask you, good sir, when was the Internet not the Wild Wild West? Do
you really believe you were in control of it at any point? You were not.<p>That does not mean that everyone behaves like an outlaw. You see, most
people do not behave like bandits if they have no reason to. We become bandits
on the Internet because you have forced our hand. The Anonymous bitchslap rings
through your ears like hacktivism movements of the 90s. We're back - and we're
not going anywhere. Expect us.",1311256578

Maximize in-game social remarketing potential to expand the audience.  600 users is small enough set that a willful larger competitor can throw 50-100K at to develop their own solution and market it to out penetrate you.  Unless this is ESPN calling to market your app on their website, I don't see this as anywhere near a fair deal at current terms.  The value of traffic is relatively low compared to high value terms like equity, brand and rev share, especially in a high growth, early stage product.<p>Don't get into hard negotiations with this firm until you know they are serious about making a play that benefits both parties equitably.  This deal initially sounds like a mid-level VP found you guys, is hustling for a stellar deal that'll make him/her look great, without the CxO's awareness.  Remember, a banner ad and pixel space on a website is cheap and relatively intangible, cold hard cash and brand awareness is not.

Looking at the simple, clean Apple URL, it does two things: it provides an easy to remember route to their specific product, and two, it feels <i>clean</i>. In contrast, the Sony URL feels dirty and disorganized, lacking a real focus and seemingly, makes the Walkmen feel like just another electronic whatchamacalit. Although it seems purely cosmetic, there's a subconscious thing going on. Yes it helps developers/consumers but even more importantly, it makes your brand look focused.

I edit my HTML/CSS stuff and as soon as I hit ""save"", it is shown immediately in the browser. All you need to do is:<p>1. Add a <meta> refresh tag to refresh the page once per second. Alternatively, with one line of JavaScript you can refresh even more frequently, e.g. immediately after ""on load"".<p>2. Bonus: Use a tiling window manager such as WMII, which automatically adjust the size of your editor window if you resize your browser window, and vice versa. That way, you get some kind of ""split mode"" and don't have to struggle with resizing multiple overlapping windows.<p>In summary, using auto-refresh + tiling window manager resulted a big increase in comfort for me. Not only during CSS development.<p><i>A bit off-topic, but related:</i> If your target runs in the command line, the Unix command ""watch"" is a perfect auto-reloader:<p><pre><code>    watch --interval=0 your-app
</code></pre>
For instance, debugging some PHP code by auto-rerunning the test suite might look like this:<p><pre><code>    watch --interval=0 php run-tests.php
</code></pre>
This gives you immediate feedback after hitting ""Save"" in your editor, without even having to struggle with your browser.",1311255229

Now I'll grant that this is a fairly big leap to make, and maybe you're not holding that position; but within the given context (of people arguing pro and con the actions of the Reddit guy what's-his-name), I think it's not unreasonable of me to assume so, either.<p>So, to close the circle, my 'question' was (but of course it is a 'question' that is, in the end, a way of stating my position in the discussion...) if it is reasonable to hold that when something is too expensive for people, it is OK to circumvent the rights holders' restrictions on the use of something. (I'm deliberately being vague on issues like 'moral ought' vs 'legal ought', if JSTOR really has a common-law variation of a database right on their collection, jurisdiction etc. - I don't really think they're important for the question at hand).",1311253717

What is this, 1999 all over again (some might say yes ha).<p>I can see big corp. getting excited over this just like 99% of the crap they buy and don't use.<p>That said, this doesn't exactly move forward with global progress on the problem or solution (as well it shouldn't wolfram is a corp after all... in the business to make money).",1311253371

Who knows - maybe they already have. After all, you admitted to actually restarting the download from a different IP, which means that the issue may be something completely different.",1311253361

I've slowely been learning by looking at very basic examples, and then needing to read source code to fill in the details for the stuff I wanted to do.<p>While there's a great deal of excitment for ClojureScript, I feel that it as an entry point (at least for me) wouldn't have enough docs for me to learn quick enough so I wouldn't become frustrated. YMMV, of course, but I think you'd be better off looking at Compojure or Moustache, Enlive or Hiccup, and Ring , or even Noir: www.webnoir.com",1311253311

Upon checking the page source, I noticed an iframe content that redirected my request to the blocked message. Playing around with the iframe source, I found that my ISP is using Netsweeper Business software for blocking the file sharing services and the control panel is publicly accessible (<a href=""http://ipaddress:8080/webadmin/start/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ipaddress:8080/webadmin/start/</a> is the link for my ISPs netsweeper control panel login page. If you're lucky enough to crack the password, you can unblock any website you want ;)). I don't really think there is any need for blocking file sharing services in India and I feel that these are just the desperate attempts by the so called DoT and the govt. to say that they're doing something.",1311253280

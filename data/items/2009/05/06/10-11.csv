Perhaps he has absolutely no idea what a password file is, let alone how to crack it with a rainbow table. HOWEVER, he does know how to sell the laptop to a local ask-no-questions pawn shop that specializes in (a) buying stolen goods, and (b) computers.<p>I suggest that the pawn shop I've just described employs someone with considerably more advanced cracking skills: they receive several stolen phones and computers a day and have a tidy business on the side selling data and stolen passwords to identity thieves.<p>I made this scenario up to illustrate that if there is valuable data that can be cracked open, the ""market"" will organize itself in such a way to get ahold of it.",1241607594

Do enough of that, and other people will become aware of your existence.<p>IRC and mailing lists are good places to hang out if you do the open source thing -- every job I've ever gotten has been via IRC.  (This probably works only if you are an active participant in a smallish community.  I wouldn't join #java on Freenode and ask for a job, or expect someone to offer one.)<p>Actually, I'm wrong -- presenting at local user groups (and conferences) is also a good idea.  That is how I got started teaching training classes (and writing).",1241607475

Genius, like intelligence, comes in different flavors.<p>In short, it's silly and ultimately pointless trying to quantify terms such as ""genius"".

A person might easily spend 5 days a week for a half-century working at a career, not to mention schooling. You'd better like what you're doing, especially in engineering.

I will go even further and say that because a staging environment needs to mimic the production environment as close as possible it should be hosted by the same vendor too.<p>You're right that if you compare numbers directly, some aspects of EC2 are more expensive than other vendors. My point is that AWS offers greater value by allowing you to do things you can't do anywhere else.<p>Allocating static IP addresses on the fly for example.",1241606242

Solaris instances are slower too but those are still considered beta.<p>I've been working on a development tool for EC2 for the past few months so I'm starting and shutting down instances almost every day. All of the Linux instances I've started have come up in less than a minute and usually around 30 seconds.<p>Keep in mind, if you're using a custom image or one that's been modified it could take longer depending on how large the image is (lots of preinstalled software) and what scripts are running on startup.",1241605624

595513,comment,595231,595231,0,0,jrockway,,,"This is what's nice about using languages with libraries.  If I want to do an unsalted SHA-1, like news.yc, I would write:<p><pre><code>    use Authen::Passphrase;\n    my $pw = Authen::Passphrase::SaltedDigest->new(\n        algorithm  => ""SHA-1"", \n        passphrase => ""passphrase"",\n    );\n</code></pre>\nIf I instead wanted to be secure, and use bcrypt (which I always do, even for the most trivial sites), I would just write:<p><pre><code>    my $pw = Authen::Passphrase::BlowfishCrypt->new(\n        cost        => 8, \n        salt_random => 1,\n        passphrase  => ""passphrase"",\n    );\n</code></pre>\nNotice how I get better security without any extra effort?  That is the joy of not being the only user of your programming language, and that's how you ensure that people do the Right Thing with your data -- make it easy for them.<p>(I'll also mention that it gets better; with Moose type coercions, I can basically treat the password as cleartext -- the type coercion converts a Str into a Passphrase.  To set it, I supply the cleartext password as an initarg when instantiating a user; when changing it, the writer accessor handles the coerciion; when checking it, I delegate to the passphrase's check_passphrase method.  A great API with great security, involving almost no effort on my part.  <3.)",1241605179

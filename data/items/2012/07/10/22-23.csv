I realize a lot of the concepts in this design have been tried before in one way or another. However, just as important as the design is seeing how if actually feels. I think it certainly looks good in photoshop but the trick is executing in a way that makes it feel ""right"" too. Any plans for development?",1341961167
4226711,comment,4225817,4225817,6,0,MichaelApproved,,,"Here's how you sustain this model: package the VM with free software just like the toolbar guys do. You pay the software guys a cut of the profit for every setup they have running (referral fee) and users get a new way to ""pay"" for software. I like this idea much better than all the spyware/crapware software vendors have to package into their product to earn a living.<p>Consumers don't care about $2/month but a business would care about getting paid $2/month thousands of times.<p>Edit: If a VM is too big to download all at once with a freeware product, you just install the seed software. Then, over the next few days, the seed software downloads the VM and slowly sets it up so there's no disruption to the customer's activity on the computer.<p>I would also suggest you reserve the space needed on the disk with an empty file, roughly the size of the VM file. This way it's clear just how much space this newly installed software is taking on the customer's computer.<p>This is all based on the idea that the customer agreed to this during the installation. To what extent ""agreed"" is left up to you to decide. I'd suggest a dedicated page during the installation with a prechecked box that explains what this is and what it's about to do.",1341961167

This is, unfortunately, a common tactic of Federal prosecutors - they throw the book at defendants and if they realize they may actually lose the case, they keep delaying any trial as long as possible so the accused does not have a chance to get their money back or clear their name. Defendants are left defending themselves against charges the government won't allow to be brought to trial. See the case of Gibson Guitars as another example.

4226680,comment,4226378,4226498,2,0,randallu,,,"I've written embedded browsers based on Gecko (ages ago), Chromium and WebKit. Gecko was a big pain (they were redoing graphics at the time, moving to ""thebes/cairo""). At some point the GNOME guys were complaining hard about not having a stable API to Gecko, and Mozilla said ""we're not interested in that, we're doing Firefox"". Really wish they hadn't taken that path.<p>Chromium is going in a similar direction, they used to have a very clean ""WebKit"" implementation (the bit which every port does itself, sits on top of WebCore) but over the years they've added a lot of policy to it and now it's hard to do anything which uses Chromium WebKit that isn't ""Chromium"". And the code outside of WebKit is very very hard to disentangle (they did some work on that for Chrome on Android, breaking out ""content"" which is a minimal embeddable browser, but it's hard to do any work on ""content"" and I have no faith that they'd want to merge anything they're not directly using).<p>Chrome for Android is closed source, too, so it's not like they have any real commitment to OSS at all (and I think this hobbles Android as a platform -- maybe it's just a reaction to the Kindle Fire, but the Android team do still seem to be working on WebView as well).<p>WebKit recently (2010?) started on WebKit2, which is a peer to Chromium's WebKit and is very straightforward to hack. WebKit2 supports multiple platforms and the WebKit project accepts contributions that aren't used by Apple, etc.<p>So I would say that if there's a big hole that Mozilla drove into, then Google Chrome is diligently driving into it too. WebKit is on good track, though, and benefits from a lot of the Google contributions (though V8 WebCore integration is a point of contention).",1341960682

We aren't ""screwing up our environment"" any more than a fish swimming is ""screwing up the glassy surface of a pond."" We exist, we live, we breed, we do things, in what is effectively a closed system. We are the fucking environment. We should (and do) seek out opportunities to do things in way that maximizes our benefit and minimizes our pain, sometimes that changes the environment in difficult to reverse ways. But we keep living, moving, and changing.<p>There is no 'nirvana' of living in balance and peace with the world. This planet kills off all life periodically. It did it to the dinosaurs, it has done so several times. You and I will end up dead at some point. Humans will, if history is a good predictor, end up all dead at some point. Get over it.<p>In the mean time, its great to develop new science around how the planet's climate is related to all sorts of things.",1341959131

The graph they link to shows Firefox down slightly at about 26% market share (although with a little uptick at the end, belying the rumours of it being ""ruined"" and its reputation ""killed"") but holding pretty steady overall at what must be several hundred million users - most of us would be fairly happy with numbers like that. Meanwhile IE is plummeting, and I don't think ""the real battle"" is between it and Chrome any more. The kind of momentum their trajectories are taking suggests that IE can't hope to take back the no.1 spot any time soon, and in fact appears likely to be competing with Firefox for third spot soon.<p>So no, I don't think it needs saving.

Presumably one has thousands, or even millions, of clients simultaneously interacting with the world and with each other. This system would imply that your (low latency) world-state would be kept in memory on a small cluster of Galaxy servers.<p>The novel quality of this system is that node data-locality is determined by how you access the data.<p>Let's say you have 10 server nodes and 10^6 clients. That means that, in the best case, each node deals with 10^5 clients. Presumably clients (or players) can move through the simulated world, hopping from node to node.<p>Here things get hazy in my mind. For example, how does the client know which server to connect to? Does it just make a guess and get redirected if it guessed wrong? When a player crosses a node threshhold, how does that work?<p>I'm thinking there must be a central character store - basically a traditional database, that handles initial node affinity. Position in the world is part of character state, and when you login, you'll be handed off to the correct node based on that state.<p>But if this is how things work, when would you ever need your ""cache lines"" moved from node to node? The world-state is spatial so why move it from node to node? I guess that's the crux - I can't think of any other data that would need to move between nodes other than player data, and in that case I don't see what data it would need to take with it.",1341958914

Your analysis says it's a pretty good deal, but that's based in part on information the banks themselves have provided, and in general is impoverished next to the information the bank has. So you buy the security. Then you find out that you didn't get a good deal on the security. So you go to another bank, and the same things happens again in a completely different way.<p>Libertarian free-market types love talking about the power of incentives.

This is trickier than it sounds because you can't use secondary indexes and queries still needs to be efficient. Some recent database engines focused on non-batch ""real-time analytics"" are designed for this; it is a different internal model than traditional distributed analytic engines. Database engine boffins know ways of achieving this, esoteric but well-understood.<p>Second, you need a distributed interval index i.e. a distributed data structure that can act as an efficient index for 3-dimensional cube types. Scalable distributed interval indexing requires that data models be embedded in a higher dimensionality space, so at least 4-dimensions. The well-known example from literature is multi-level grids but those have many limitations. The state-of-the-art structures are adaptive spatial sieves; advanced versions are computationally efficient even for very high dimensionality cubes. However, these algorithms are encumbered and little has been published on them. (Disclosure: I am the inventor of the first useful spatial sieve algorithms. The idea dates back to at least 1990 but had unsolved theoretical issues until 2007.)<p>I am building a real-time analytical database similar to this right now, and petabyte-scale 3-dimensional spatial data models are a core part of its functionality. Building fast, distributed 3d spatial databases are achievable, it just requires a different data structures and algorithms skill set than you would use for more traditional database designs.",1341958247

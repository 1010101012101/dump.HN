We don&#x27;t pluralize the name of a rail system like Shinkansen because there is only one of it (similarly, &quot;the L&quot; but not &quot;the Ls&quot;). But there are many Japanese loanwords that are commonly pluralized differently in English. For example, futons, tycoons, typhoons, tatamis, ninjas and kimonos.<p>It&#x27;s ambiguous whether &quot;kanji&quot; is a mass noun referring to the character set as a whole or a singular noun referring to a character in the set.

I understand if you spend all day making shapeless / scalaz the lack of sugar for type lambda&#x27;s is annoying. Why not make a SIP to add some sugar there?<p>2. Singleton types would have use in ScalaJs as well for encoding. There is already a SIP for this.<p>3. Byte / Short literals, seem like again, a SIP could be made for the \nnext release.<p>So all this boils down to getting SIPs into the language faster. So I think the real feature is not having to wait 3+ years for language improvements that significantly improve the QOL of some library writers.<p>That is a feature I would like as well. I really miss being able to open the mailing list and scan for exciting new features, Instead I know even if someone has a great idea, it&#x27;ll be years before it sees the light of day. This sucks and I&#x27;ve moved onto to getting my neat idea -> wow I can use this in my language fix to ScalaJS[1].<p>I think (thought?) about Scala as ycombinator for language features. I see this enterprise mindset coming in now trying to tie down what Scala is and ultimately I fear that it will kill all the things that has made Scala popular in the first place. Pushing to a more infrequent release model <i>might</i> help enterprise customers but it absolutely crushes library developers in the vanguard working to make the Scala of tomorrow by fighting to get the language features of today. They need  turn around on the improvements listed above and can&#x27;t wait 4+ years to get them.<p>So does Scala take all the strength it has built up from acting as a feature incubator for the last 10 years and switch and lock down what works, it is in a prime position to do so? It has a virtual monopoly on it&#x27;s space.<p>Or does Scala continue to act as a language feature incubator giving its coders early access to cutting edge CS idioms in a mainstream language. There are a lot of CS ideas waiting to get their shot.<p>Some people would see this situation and say Scala is facing a mutually exclusive set of outcomes, it must decide now. Nonsense I say! When confronted with tough choices I think of the famous Yogi Berra quote &quot;When you see a fork in the road, take it.&quot;<p>I ask myself is there some way we can have our cake and eat it too? Can we go on trying out new features while still oferring stability to those willing to wait for it?<p>What if we moved to model of more frequently releases + less frequent releases? A controlled fork within the ecosystem, similar to what Ubuntu / Fedora does.<p>Publish 2 major short term releases a year that cutting edge library writers can target and build their libraries against. Vend these are properly tagged releases in maven central. Stick any old SIP in there, the enterprise overlords don&#x27;t have to know about it. Rapid iteration, with rapid fall-off in support, a fun Scala for those of us that love using new features, bugs and all, for us the language is about growth.<p>Then have an LTS version released every other year that picks up the features that worked and everyone seems to love and that will be supported for years into the future. Relatively slow iteration with slow fall off in support, vend this Scala to enterprise users with a coherent multi-year support policy that just oozes with that &#x27;this is rock solid and will work for eons to come&#x27; professional vibe that makes them happy.<p>1: I am using ScalaJS and man it feels great, it&#x27;s like Scala of 6 years ago, I love opening the mailing list to see if there is a new release with some awesome new features / improvements. There is a lot of green territory over there because it&#x27;s targeting a new platform and that will settle with time, but already it beats the socks off all the other competitors in the statically typed compiles to JS camp, just no one knows it yet.",1409684097

I think these libraries are a really nice way to bone up on theory and see how certain abstract concepts get expressed in something that is computable. None of that is the issue. The issue is that there is now going to be an unnecessary choice involved in what toolchain you are going to use even though the choice is going to be completely irrelevant. The enterprise guys are not going to use anything that is not backed by service/stability guarantees and the group that is going to use the alternate toolchain is potentially going to diverge more and more from the stable branch. It just feels like a whole bunch of wasted effort. There are many examples of this happening already. The biggest example being D and the fork of the standard library in the early days.

Another is &quot;fixing emaiL&quot; or &quot;email is broken&quot;.<p>It isn&#x27;t.<p>With all the change that&#x27;s happened with the Internet two forms of communication have proven to be incredibly resilient: SMS and email.<p>SMS is resilient because every phone has it. It&#x27;s portable and it&#x27;s simple. The best effort thus far at dethroning SMS seems to be WhatsApp. Sure phone companies (particularly US phone companies) charge a ridiculous amount for SMS. It&#x27;s no longer the valuable bandwidth control channel that it once was. But even so, I don&#x27;t see it going away anytime soon.<p>The beauty of email is that it&#x27;s largely decentralized. With something like Facebok, you get ads inserted into your stream, you&#x27;re constantly at risk of some privacy snafu and there&#x27;s always the risk the service changes in some problematic (for you) way or disappears altogether (OK, Facebook isn&#x27;t going anywhere anytime soon but we&#x27;ve all had services we like get bought out and sunsetted).<p>Email addresses are mostly non-portable. You can have your own domain and have a portable address but most people don&#x27;t. Just like a phone number has limited portability (eg only within the same country).<p>Changing phone numbers and email addresses seems to be an infrequent enough occurrence for most people that they don&#x27;t really care about it (as a whole).<p>Certain services provide useful value-adds to email. Spam filtering on GMail is a prime example. There are ads on the Web UI but hey you don&#x27;t have to use it (there are POP3/IMAP interfaces) and they aren&#x27;t that offensive (as, say, Facebook ads are).<p>The fundamental use case of both SMS and email is one person sending a message to another person. Think of this like IP (the protocol). People find each other with contacts. Think of this like DNS (kinda).<p>Every &quot;email killer&quot; I&#x27;ve seen has made this most important use case harder or just more complicated and, more to the point, for this use case provides no tangible benefits (that anyone cares about).<p>And in all cases you&#x27;re giving up the decentralized nature of email so someone has control over your messages and your experience. Why would anyone make that tradeoff? It doesn&#x27;t make any sense.<p>So forever? Well that&#x27;s tough to argue. But for a really long time? Sure, absolutely.",1409682254

Experience with AWS, apache storm, stream processing or high volume, low-latency applications are all plusses.<p>The things I’ve enjoyed most since starting here a few months ago:<p>- Interesting problem space<p>- Interesting tech stack<p>- I get to wear sandals to work<p>- Team running group that goes for a run together every Wednesday morning before lunch<p>- Company gym<p>- Quickly-growing team<p>- Good medical insurance coverage<p>- Starting a lunch time study group (with lunch provided by the company!)<p>Interested?

However how is it different from hiring someone and letting him go after a month if you think he&#x27;s not a good fit? The mention of a month of bootcamp or &quot;orientation&quot; is mainly to set expectations.<p>You should always hire the best candidate which you think will work out but that month allow you to set the right phase, this is a month where you both give the best to make that relationship work - orientation, pairing, documentation, short meetings to discuss potential roadblocks or issues.<p>All startups usually do this - I just consider it&#x27;s a good practice to say it out loud that there&#x27;s a period where we both find out if we want to keep working together.",1409681086

I cannot go too much into details, but as a partner, we have access to the live submission feed which we analyze in real-time to discover new threats etc. I can assure you that we are not the only one. Furthermore, most partners sync their data not in real-time which could yield incorrect scanning results, making the hackers think they&#x27;re good to go.<p>I can also say that the more serious groups/hackers do not use VirusTotal to check their malware.

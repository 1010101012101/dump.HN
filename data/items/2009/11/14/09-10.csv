I'm talking about being a software developer. As a software developer, you have damned near infinite options for making a living. And a lot of those options provide more dignity, <i>and</i> more money, than being Apple's bitch.<p>The notion that selling iPhone apps is a ""gold mine"" for developers is a bit like saying the lottery is a good investment strategy. Yes, some developers make a lot of money from iPhone applications. Most do not. I suspect that building products for the much wider general software market or the web market would be a much more profitable path for your efforts (at least, that's been where I've placed my bets, and where I plan to continue placing my bets in the future).",1258192588

941584,comment,940776,940776,0,0,mojonixon,,,"If you're interested in how the pros do it, about 5 years ago I temped at a bulk mailer--mostly medicare checks to doctors--using pitney bowes(IIRC) equipment. The machine I was running was organized in an L shape 20'x20'. One side would strip the letter off the continuous paper stack, collate it, fold it, and seal it in an envelope. The second side would stamp it and stack it in postal bins. A bad day I would do about 20,000 but if I had everything calibrated and the guy on the shift before didn't muck things up too bad I could get close to 50000 in an 8 hour shift. The system I was using rather old and temperamental, so I wouldn't be surprised if modern equipment is an order of magnitude faster.<p>Once the machine was running I didn't have to do much besides put envelopes in the hopper, but the noise, paper cuts, and opportunity to lose a finger while clearing a jam made it a horrible job.",1258190088

941582,comment,940188,940646,0,0,ismarc,,,"Your logic is flawed (as is nearly every ""solution"" to one of these problems I've seen).  The question wasn't ""How many barbers should there be?""  It was ""How many barbers are there?""  This is an important distinction as your approach shows the appropriate number of barber shops that can reasonably be operated and have no shortage of customers due to hair growth speeds.  I would approach the problem from the opposite direction.  How many distinct professions are there in San Francisco?  What is the current population?  What are the percentage breakdowns of those professions?  At that point, you can easily get the number of people employed as barbers.  Now, did they want individual barbers, or the number of barber shops?  You then only need to infer the number of barbers per shop, rather than estimating a lot of data that isn't readily available.",1258189764

Sure, this is supposed to be ""family time"" but you'll still be near them and at the least, be building the exploratory building blocks for a potential business that, if successful, could give you a whole lot more time w/ your family than you can ever get with your present job.<p>You should set an income goal (how much you need per month to take care of your family comfortably) and then try and plan a business that can help you reach that goal quickly and consistently.<p>My guess is you already have a lot of skills you can bank on to start a number of profitable businesses.

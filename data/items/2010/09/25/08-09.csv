The BSD license is a bit too enabling of developers who want to put restrictions on their users for my tastes. I'm not sure I take a stand as strong as RMS about what freedoms end-users should have, but imo every user should have at least the right to reverse-engineer software for personal use, while if I BSD-license code, someone can build something on <i>my</i> code that they slap an odious EULA on. I mean, maybe they can build it without my code, too, but I still don't really want to see something I built get tangled up in that kind of thing.<p>In particular, it could lead to <i>me</i> breaking the law! If someone built something using my code that they then kept closed-source and put a ""no-reverse-engineering"" kind of EULA on, I'd of course be curious how they'd built on my stuff, and would want to reverse engineer it.

1726614,comment,1725592,1726217,0,0,derefr,,,"> So no - a universe could have completely different maths required to describe it.<p>That wasn't the question, though. Pi is the ratio between circumference and diameter of a perfect circle, whether or not you can create a perfect circle in your universe. We can't even create one in ours, and yet pi still ""exists"" here. Undoubtedly, wiggly-space mathematicians would also have a conception of pi, though it might be as esoteric to them as toroidial universes are to us.<p>To put that another way: Math has very simple axioms (e.g. set theory), and everything else derives from them. What theories can be proven from those axioms in this universe, can be proven from those axioms in any universe (and a universe that doesn't obey those axioms likely wouldn't ""function"" as a universe—it wouldn't have any reason to be causal, for example.) The maths describing a particular universe is its <i>physics</i>, which do change from universe to universe—however, those physics are all just different <i>subsets</i> of the set of mathematical physical models—which are, themselves, a subset of the mathematical theories provable from the axioms.",1285404126

The carriers have a strangle-hold over this and can cut messages off on a whim. We had an experience once with Verizon where they ""accidentally"" cut-off our short-code to Poll Everywhere on a Friday evening due to some ""clerical errors"". 72 hours later they finally had somebody ""fix"" the situation (support doesn't work on weekends there), and in the meantime we were left in a really bad place trying to explain to our customers how Verizon screwed us over.<p>I've dealt with some total dopes at Celltrust (I need to call these guys out, they're atrociously bad. Please don't do business with them unless you absolutely have to) where our service to Canada was entirely out for a week because they changed how their API worked. They failed to communicate that to us and nobody at their company could tell me how it worked so I had to fire up nc -l, point their gateway at that server, find somebody from Canada who could send a text, and see what came in. After the fact, I told them how horrible the experience was and provided recommendations on how they could improve it. They threatened to cut us off as a client because they felt I was being mean to them instead of acting on the feedback that could have made their service better.<p>Twilio thinks this is assine and are trying to change how this all works. We've shared with them the pains we've experienced with SMS aggregators and they share the same thoughts with us that its a totally unnecessary amount of pain that developers face to build SMS applications. They're really trying to make this easier and lower the bar.<p>Anthony, while your experience wasn't that hot, it was far and above what you'd experience elsewhere. At least Jeff acknowledges that Twilio could do better. That is so far above and beyond anything else in the industry.

Loans would probably be pretty tough to exploit, since it's the bank's money you'd be stealing and they would take measures against that.  The government, however, is much less efficient and just plain terrible at countering fraud.<p>Medicare fraud, for example, is pretty huge right now.  Of the $500,000,000,000 that government pays out annually, it's estimated 10% of that is fraud.  Pretty insane stuff.<p>Scammers will set up a medical equipment storefront (to collect checks... they are never open), signed off by a crooked, made up, or identity-stolen doctor.  Then, they'll buy lists of information online (SSN + DOB + Medicare ID), and issue fraudulent charges to that person's Medicare account.  Expensive things, like prosthetic arms and such.  Medicare is required to reimburse the storefront the cost of the item within 60 days (it used to be 30 days, until Obamacare passed).  The fraud detection is so bad at Medicare, that even when people actively report the fraudulent charges (imagine getting a Medicare invoice that says you've required 4 new arms this month), the crooks still get away.<p>The thieves run through a few of their stolen identity lists, cash those checks, close up shop, open up a new shop down the block, and repeat.<p>This is essentially a summary of what I saw on 60 minutes a month ago, so you should do some fact checking.

I was confused at first, but I read about the first third of the couchDB book and then got it, and now I am excited that a ""distributed map reduce system in erlang"" (or javascript) is a much better solution- essentially my query results are pre-computed by mapreduce and this should make performance much better.<p>This is a lot easier than trying to figure out how to make SQL queries that will be performant or optimizing them later... in a previous startup we lost about 18 months solving this very problem.  In fact, I see map reduce as a competitive advantage.<p>Maybe I'm a fool... I hope not.",1285402153

However, I gather the hope is that an actual brand image (e.g. ""Pepsi"") rather than a household word (such as 'a coke' referring to many different sodas, or ""Kleenex"" referring to all things facial tissue) will help combat the clones and rip-offs. Perhaps if only because customers will expect to see the company logo stamped on 'quality' hardware.",1285401603

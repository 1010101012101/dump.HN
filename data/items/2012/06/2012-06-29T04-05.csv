Bicycle design and engineering has been improving for 100+ years.<p>Mission Bicycles are designed for a specific purpose, commuting in American cities. We optimized for:<p>- Ride feel: A frame geometry that put riders in an up-right position for comfort and visibility and made the bicycle very stable and responsive even at low speeds.<p>- Strength: Components and materials that are strong enough to last a life time even with the daily abuse of a city commute.<p>- Ease of use: Other than fixing an occasional flat, brake pad swap, or chain grease there is nothing on the bicycle to fidget with or break. We literally took everything off the bike that you don't need for a city commute which saves greatly on weight. A typical Mission Bicycle weighs in at 16lbs, which is important for when you need to cary it up a flight of stairs.<p>The bicycle features you mention (bottle cages, fenders, racks, etc.) were purposefully excluded from the bicycle's design to save on weight, maintenance, and cost.",1340945395

4175286,story,,,1,0,swarnet5,"Tobacco Warning: Even Non-Smokers Are At Risk",,"Visit http://www.ecigzone.tk<p>Smoking or puffing a tobacco cigarette is a vice that literally enslaves millions of people around the world. It is amazing how a small roll of finely cut tobacco, enclosed in a thin, paper wrapper could cause so much addiction. More than just an addiction, tobacco smoking is a very serious health risk. In fact, the World Health Organization says that traditional cigarette smoking is responsible for at least five million deaths each year. The WHO also estimates that at least 650 million people (the estimated total number of traditional smokers around the world today) will eventually die due to tobacco-related diseases. The said agency also released strong warnings about tobacco smoking during pregnancy. Pregnant women who smoke are at high risk of giving birth to premature or underweight babies. Some birth defects have been attributed to tobacco cigarette use. Smokers have been found to be overwhelmingly more prone to heart disease and respiratory problems compared with non-smokers.<p>In another study, the American Cancer Society pointed out that about 3,000 non-smoking adults die each year of lung cancer because of the effects of second-hand smoke. Second-hand smoke is a mixture of the traditional smoke from the burning end of a tobacco cigarette, pipe, or cigar. The traditional smoke exhaled by smokers are involuntarily inhaled by non-smokers. The second-hand smoke actually lingers in the air for several hours where a smoker puffed a tobacco cigarette. Second-hand smoke, also known as Environmental Tobacco Smoke (ETS) is now considered by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as a cause of cancer, a classification that has long been made by various health and medical associations. Second-hand smoke contains formaldehyde, benzene, vinyl chloride, arsenic ammonia, and hydrogen cyanide  all of which are toxic or carcinogenic. Cited below are some of the facts and important information about the risks of traditional smoking and exposure to second-hand smoke:<p>* One in two lifetime traditional smokers will die as a result of tobacco cigarette use;
* The mixture of nicotine and carbon monoxide in each tobacco cigarette can increase blood pressure and heart rate;
* Tobacco smoking is a leading cause of stroke and heart attack;
* The tar coats your lungs like a soot in a chimney and causes cancer;
* It is a slow way to die. You may get emphysema, bronchitis, and other cardio-pulmonary diseases; and
* Traditional smokers are more prone to lung cancer, head and neck cancer, pancreatic cancer, esophageal cancer, colorectal cancer, stomach cancer, bladder cancer, cervical cancer, and even breast cancer.<p>Quitting smoking is a difficult undertaking that demands discipline and commitment. Some can quit ""cold turkey"" while other need professional help and medication. Nicotine replacements in the form of patches have also been released in the market to help smokers who want to stop their habit.<p>While smoking is, in reality, an addition  there is help available. Quitting this vice is a life-and-death issue. Getting rid of tobacco will not only help decrease health risks, it would also help spare non-smokers from the dangers of second-hand smoke.

Chinese law can seem a lot more laisse faire compared to US law, unless they think you are in debt (and then you get imprisoned). Actually, it's not always laisse faire, it just looks that way because some things aren't enforced, and other things are - it's different, and your supplier knows the law better than you.<p>From reading <a href=""http://www.chinalawblog.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.chinalawblog.com/</a>, it seems one solution is to include an arbitration clause. You can take them to arbitration in the US, using US law, and get the decision enforced by arbitration treaties. But you'd want legal advice for this - if you mess up, the you can end up in a no-man's land where the Chinese courts refuse to see you (because you've specified a foreign legal jurisdiction), and refuse to enforce a foreign ruling because it's not in their jurisdiction.<p>Also, you want some things in Chinese. If anything gets used in a Chinese court, it gets translated to Chinese. If the other party manages to influence the official translation (or the official translation is just wrong), it's not going to be fun trying to change the courts mind.<p>Whatever the case, working with a Chinese supplier requires a good OEM agreement, written with the advice of a lawyer who knows the ins and outs of Chinese OEM agreements. It's not easy, but it's better than your supplier seeing you as an easy mark.",1340944105

And of course we don't have good data and controls to compare non incubator startups either.<p>I would argue that, similar to ""psychic income"" there is a certain ""psychic bump"" to feeling that (even wrongly) you are on your way to something because of the structure of the incubators. Something similar might be companies back in the day (not sure if this is done anymore but it was in the 80's) who would take groups of laid off workers and have them show up at an office to work on resumes and look for jobs. Being in the presence of other job seekers apparently did some good for them in terms of their self esteem and how they approached that task (as opposed to doing it from home). (My first hand experience with this was as a vendor to a company that became the leader in this field, Manchester Career which landed large contract after contract and expanded greatly because of what they were able to achieve).<p>So I would question that there isn't some benefit to the lower tier incubators that is worthwhile to experience and I don't believe that has been proven out in any research of them  and in fact there is this story which was widely discussed here:<p><a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/tomiogeron/2012/04/30/top-tech-incubators-as-ranked-by-forbes-y-combinator-tops-with-7-billion-in-value/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.forbes.com/sites/tomiogeron/2012/04/30/top-tech-i...</a>",1340942832

Sometimes I don't hear about parties / events, but it's usually just an event that I'd either hear about anyway, or would be uninteresting to me in some way. Other than that, no life-changing epiphanies, no extra productivity, no increased level of smugness. Absolutely nothing has changed, and nobody cares. The author of the article may be concerned, thinking their life will change drastically or they will drop off the face of the earth and have to claw their way back to the top of their perceived social food chain, but they'll learn over time that their presence on facebook also does not matter, and they'll have to find another way to tell the world about their thoughts, and hope that people will sign up for an RSS feed to know when they've made new blog posts.",1340942694

4175173,comment,4174550,4174794,6,0,jakejake,,,"agreed.  They'll only replace those systems when the expense of maintaining them is greater than re-writing.  I'm 100% in favor of making it increasingly more painful for companies to hold back progress.<p>I do have to say that my impression from comments that some devs don't actually comprehend the scope of the trouble for some of these companies.  On the surface you might think it's just a lazy IT department who won't upgrade the browsers.  But really the situation is that companies built their internal infrastructure using things like ActiveX components for IE and these systems are probably more like desktop apps than web-based apps.  They use all of the old IE components to interact with the desktop and do things that may still not even be possible with a regular web-based app.  So it is not necessarily that they're surfing the web with IE6 because they're too lazy to upgrade the browsers or their javascript code - rather they are stuck with it because they have huge infrastructure that depends on those old components to run.  It's hard to actually understand that now, but at the time 15 years ago it was really cutting edge stuff and MS managed to get some serious vendor lock-in.",1340942602

As we got into the car to head to the other factories, the factory owner conveniently disappeared and we were whisked off with his assistant and a machinist.  It was unclear where we were going.  After a long drive, the car stopped and we were told to get out.  There was no factory.</i><p><i>We were on a dark, narrow road where every storefront was some variation of a live/work machine shop.  Each one different.  Each one specialized.  A whole town of them, crammed side by side on narrow streets lit only by the glow of naked fluorescent bulbs.  Think Bladerunner meets pre-industrial metal shops.  The energy was palpable.  Clean? No.  Could we find it on a map?  No.  Could we have ever imagined that a factory work is outsourced to places like this? Definitely not.  And even though we had never seen anything like it before, we could recognize it straight away.  Every shop was run by highly skilled, passionate, self-taught makers.  A lot like the shops many of our friends back home run.  They are their own bosses.  They live for and are proud of their work.  This was nothing like the factory where we spent the past few days.  It was invigorating.</i><p><i>The man that machines the screw parts is awesome and his setup is incredible.  He has six CNC swiss screw machines in a storefront garage, in the back room is his office, a small kitchenette, a toilet (which you flush by pouring a bucket of water into it) and a small room off the back where he and his wife sleep. ...</i><p>(I received my Pen Type-A a month or two ago, by the way.

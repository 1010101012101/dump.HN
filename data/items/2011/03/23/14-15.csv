Take this one for example:<p>>Just last week, I had a conversation with an HR executive at a leading financial institution. He was calling because two of his firm's most important executives - each paid millions and millions of dollars - had come to him saying they just weren't sure they could keep it up anymore.<p>>They each listed their challenges: incredibly long hours, relentless travel, 24-7 digital demands, time away from their families and insufficient energy to even take care of themselves.<p>I read it as, ""I'm tired of getting paid big bucks to jet-set around the world on the company's dime."" I compare this to the situation faced by the bottom billion of the world - e.g. being unsure of where the next meal is going to come from and I have a very hard time taking any of these executives' complaints seriously.<p>Top executives are like professional athletes. The pressure to perform is an inherent part of the job, and indeed, it is what justifies the high salaries and other rewards. You can't accept an executive position and then complain about the stresses of the job. Stress comes with the territory, just like the $250,000 a year salary.",1300892302

People can do some amazing things.<p>> Edit: the problem is this, nuclear power is being put up to a far higher standard than any other power source because of irrational fears.<p>Yes, thats true.\nBut it is also held to a higher standard, because the contents of a reactor (eg plutonium) are extremely toxic, in a way that no other power source is.\nThe worst case scenario is thus very bad.<p>>There is risk in any activity, especially providing electrical power. People die from dams failing, from refinery explosions, etc. The question should be whether we can build nuclear plants that are at least as safe as competing power sources, and the answer, even in the wake of Fukushima, seems to be a resounding yes.<p>However, if out-of-control events had happened just slightly differently, the answer would have been a resounding 'No'.<p>And that's my problem with this sort of reasoning.\nWhether the answer was a resounding 'Yes' or 'No' seems to depend on whether there was (for example) another explosion, in an out of control situation, that had already had several explosions.<p>This is just like the shuttle scenario.\nMost of the safeguards, which were never designed to be defeated, have been defeated.\nThat there was no release does not mean there was a margin for error.<p>We nearly - from an engineering point of view - had a level 7 event, in a highly populated, first world country.\nI am arguing that anyone that derives solace from this situation is being foolish.<p>I am not arguing the merits of nuclear power.

That's where Microsoft makes most of their money, particularly Office.  Google has docs, AppEngine, and more.  For many mainstream people these days, the browser is the only thing that they need; Microsoft is still powerful, but if the trends continue, they'll be irrelevant.

For fission power a lot of those costs are novel or at least unknown and unappreciated by the population at large (who, sadly, are woefully ignorant about such things). For coal, oil, wood, etc. those costs have been known and paid for so long that they have become accepted.<p>We render huge portions of land, collectively larger than the Chernobyl exclusion zone, uninhabitable by man or animal and we accept that as the cost of digging up coal. Millions of people throughout history have fallen to early deaths due to the smoke and pollution of wood and coal fires, and to gas and diesel smog, but we accept that as the way things are. London is not naturally a foggy city, but it has been densely inhabited for so many hundreds of years and has had a persistent <i>smog</i> for so much of that time that the term ""London fog"" has become part of the lexicon.<p>Simply put, we look at our energy sources and our eyes skip over their downsides, largely because they are so familiar, we could not imagine a world without them. Nuclear is new, some of the downsides have yet to be experienced (the Fukushima accidents being a case in point), but the question still remains: are the downsides less than those of other power sources? If you build nuclear reactors to the level of safety precautions of the old Soviet Union (within epsilon of the null-set) then perhaps not, but if you build more responsibly then perhaps so.",1300890873

For awhile I didn't understand why they would do this (and I know a lot of people who still don't get it).<p>If your goal is to catch people driving drunk, then no, it doesn't make sense to announce the locations of DUI checkpoints. If however your goal is to prevent people from driving drunk in the first place, it might make sense to announce checkpoints at a number of locations throughout the city. If the potential drunk driver knows he can't go too many places without passing though a checkpoint he may decide to just stay home.",1300889046

It's tough, but just like any other startup you get out of it what you put in - hard work in school and hard work on the ground have put me in a position where I can get by and probably pay my student loans off in 30 years or so.<p>Let me say that again.  I will probably be able to pay my student loans off in 30 years or so.  I have an LL.M. in tax and am hustling for every dime I can get.<p>The lawyers you're working with in a transaction like this are doubtless badasses.  They work for a big firm, in a tall shiny building, with sexy secretaries and bookish paralegals.  They have continuously updated libraries, and conference rooms, and expensive subscriptions to LexisNexis and Westlaw.  They wear $1000 suits and fly to meetings on a private jet.  These things cost money... lots of it.<p>As a VC investing in startups, you know you have the choice in which companies you trust.  The same can be said for attorneys.  If you choose flash over substance, you're going to end up paying big bucks every time.<p>Should it cost $17,000 for a transaction that probably didn't take more than a few hours of an attorney's time?  Nope.  Whose fault is it that it did?  As with any product, the lawyers you've selected are charging what the market will bear and billing you what they know you'll pay.<p>Spend some time finding an attorney that you can trust that cares more about doing quality work than a fancy office.  In NYC, there are some really amazing LL.M. programs - find a recent grad from a tax program.  They're certainly able to put together a 'standard' deal and incorporation, and are better equipped to help a startup plan intelligently anyway.  They'd be thrilled to have the business and the experience, and you'd get much better service at a reasonable price.<p>And if you ever decide to invest in an Indiana company....  look me up.",1300889022

It is very difficult to figure out where and who to show your code too.<p>When I applied to undergrad 5 (or was it 6?) years ago I applied to CMU. I submitted with my application an ""abstract"" about some software I wrote. The software was really good. In fact it got me a job my first year in college (at a security consulting company). But, I don't think it got to the right people at CMU. They probably looked at a low score I got on a test and passed.<p>Maybe I should have tried MIT instead of CMU.

View, and even controller-level tests are brittle. If I'm going to spend time on brittle tests, I'd rather it be at the highest level. My thinking is, if your app can run a marathon, it can probably also walk.

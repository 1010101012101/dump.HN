3129040,comment,3128480,3128480,0,0,seven_stones,,,"This whole treatment is a little odd.<p>First, he had a second ""founder"" before the program started, so it wasn't single-founder.<p>Second, <i>luckily</i> the second guy turned out to be ""perfect"".  This could easily have backfired.  It is <i>far</i> more likely that adding someone as a founder who you haven't worked with before will torpedo the company.  IIRC, YC made this point previously.<p>So actually it was bad advice, like hitting on 17 in Blackjack, or not getting the right pot odds to call in Hold'em, and then calling anyway.<p>If you win, it's just dumb luck.  If you try running the experiment a hundred times, adding an extra unknown person not only to a promising single founder but also trying to make promising two-person groups into three-person groups, you're going to <i>decrease</i> almost everyone's chances.<p>Third, there is pronounced over-romanticization of founders.  It is extremely common for the founders to NOT be the most important cogs in their own companies.  It is very common for companies to be started by people who have money but not skills, and of course then the people who DO everything are non-founders.  It is also common for founders <i>with</i> skills to have employees with much better skills at the same thing.  And even the decision-making is frequently done by advisors who guide the young and inexperienced founders on every key issue regarding having a company.<p>Tom was just the PR cover for MySpace.  And who do you think really runs Facebook?  Or Apple in its early days?  Woz never ran engineering at Apple, and Jobs didn't run the company until his second coming.  The gee-whiz kids in the dorms and garages are just the figureheads to market to their demographic.  Just like Hot Topic markets to people who want to make a show out of how they refuse to conform by buying non-conformist uniforms in malls.<p>And dedication, sure.  But some companies get lucky in less than a year, like Auctomatic.  PG had to work for THREE years before he could retire.  Drew has been going for four.<p>But dedication isn't as rare as it seems.  Just look at the factory workers who work harder jobs for longer hours year after year making their Macbooks.<p>Overemphasis on founders hurts companies.  One of the reasons it's so hard to hire is that founders think it's ""generous"" to offer a fraction of a percent equity to someone they desperately need to do the thing the company was founded to make in the first place.<p>IIRC, RethinkDB is/was in this boat.  If you don't <i>start</i> with the needed expertise, and you find that you need to hire it or else you don't have a product, why would someone come work for you for 0.5% and average salary when by definition he could just start his own company doing the same thing?<p>So there are a zillion startups each with a handful of people at most and they all complain about the scarcity of talent, while they are offering the same or less as big companies that stick you with less responsibility, fewer hours, and no worries about burn rate.<p>Being a founder isn't special.  What's special is solving hard problems and making the decisions that lead to a successful product or useful technology.  That is orthogonal to being a founder.<p>No, really.  Founders aren't special.<p>SBA.gov:<p>> <i>An estimated 627,200 new employer firms began operations in 2008, and 595,600 firms closed that year. This amounts to an annual turnover of about 10 percent for entry and 10 percent for exit. Nonemployer firms have turnover rates three times as high as those of employer firms, mostly because of easier entry and exit conditions.</i><p>If you want a successful company, come off your high horse and spread out the equity.  I've seen promising companies bite the dust or spin their wheels for years because the founder(s) couldn't bear to part with their equity, and end up holding close to a hundred percent of nothing.",1319006776

This man was blameless and upright; he feared God and shunned evil. 2 He had seven sons and three daughters, 3 and he owned seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen and five hundred donkeys, and had a large number of servants. He was the greatest man among all the people of the East.

    4 His sons used to hold feasts in their homes on their birthdays, and they would invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them. 5 When a period of feasting had run its course, Job would make arrangements for them to be purified. Early in the morning he would sacrifice a burnt offering for each of them, thinking, Perhaps my children have sinned and cursed God in their hearts. This was Jobs regular custom.

    6 One day the angels[a] came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan[b] also came with them. 7 The LORD said to Satan, Where have you come from?

    Satan answered the LORD, From roaming throughout the earth, going back and forth on it. 

    8 Then the LORD said to Satan, Have you considered my servant Job? There is no one on earth like him; he is blameless and upright, a man who fears God and shuns evil. 

    9 Does Job fear God for nothing? Satan replied. 10 Have you not put a hedge around him and his household and everything he has? You have blessed the work of his hands, so that his flocks and herds are spread throughout the land. 11 But now stretch out your hand and strike everything he has, and he will surely curse you to your face. 

    12 The LORD said to Satan, Very well, then, everything he has is in your power, but on the man himself do not lay a finger.

3128952,comment,3128881,3128881,5,0,nostrademons,,,"No.  It was, once, until I realized that I could have my startup or my sanity, and I chose my sanity.  (And then my life became my work once again once I got put on an important project at my employer, go figure, but again I figured that I could choose my smarts or my sanity, and again I decided to go for sanity.)<p>Ironically, I've found I became <i>more</i> effective once I let go a little bit and gave myself permission to be lazy once in a while.  My startup failed despite my best efforts, and I struggled for almost 2 years after getting a job to get promoted.  And then once I said ""fuck it"", the promotion came within 4 months, I started becoming respected within the organization and known as the ""go-to"" guy for projects, people started listening to my ideas, and I became a whole lot happier inside and outside of work.<p>I suspect that what's going on is that that hyper-focus causes you to ignore the world around you and miss opportunities.  I wrote a helluva lot of code in that time period, but most of it was solving the wrong problems.  Once I took a step back and said ""Okay.  Enough code.  I'll start paying attention to people instead"", I got a much better sense of what they actually want.  I write a lot less - and a lot of the time, I just get someone else to write it for me ;-) - but what I do write generally makes someone happy.",1319004240

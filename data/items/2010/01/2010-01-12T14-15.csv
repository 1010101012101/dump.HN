In some jurisdictions, it's possible to seek damages for the cost of defending a failed lawsuit.  I don't know if any of these jurisdictions extend this to patent litigation, or what tax and other implications might be of incorporating there (so that one might legitimately change venue to such a location).  The two typical problems with this approach are getting into the right jurisdiction and being able to front the money for the defense in the first place.<p>Also, if the patent troll is suing a bunch of companies you're insuring based on the same patent, you could attempt to combine the cases, thus consolidating the defense costs.  This works because patent trolls work by firing off lots of very similar lawsuits, each for a small enough amount that it's economical to settle.  That's what keeps <i>their</i> costs down; such an insurance policy would let the defense leverage the same economy of scale.",1263307265

Maybe it is lazy loaded, maybe cached, whatever, but you have an array with keys that match properties.<p>You could use a giant switch, a slew of if(isset()) code, or you could do something like this:<p><pre><code>  public function __construct($data = array()) {
	foreach($data as $k => $v)
		$this->{$k} = $v;
  }

Obviously, this is POC stuff, in reality you'd want to put a 1-line check in there to ensure the $k is a valid property in that class.<p>AFAIK, there's nothing you can do with variable variables that you can't do another way.

It's almost impossible to do one handed (unlike the iPhone, which while slow one-handed, is very usable).<p>Add to the ergonomics issue the fact that keyboards are not very useful for languages like Chinese, and you have to ask if there isn't another way that they might do input. Apple already has tech on the new macbooks that lets you draw Chinese characters on the touchpad with your finger. My bet is that they repurpose that for other languages and include it in the tablet.

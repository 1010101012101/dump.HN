125086,comment,123903,123954,0,0,iamelgringo,,,"I'd disagree for someone unfamiliar with programming as the author seems to be.  Ruby isn't a good starter language, IMO.  It has a bit too much magic for beginners for my taste.  It's absorbed a bit too much from Perl in that it's a lot easier to write than to read.  When people are first learning a language, I'd suggest a language that has a little more structure to it than Ruby.  That's why I suggested Python and Django.<p>I really don't have anything against Ruby and Rails.  I really like the Rails framework and there's a lot of great stuff there.  I just don't think that Ruby is a best first language to learn.",1204154915

It seems to me that file copying is best left below the OS.<p>Basically, DRBD gives you RAID-like replication of data across multiple physical hosts. This makes deployment of high-availability services stupidly easy, if sometimes less efficient than applicaiton-level replication protocols.<p>For mail spools, NFS shares, or other simple file-based systems, though, it works pretty well.",1204154317
125079,comment,124760,124993,0,0,rcoder,,,"The description of DRBD as software RAID is a bit misleading, since in most deployment scenarios, only the ""primary"" node of the pair can actually write data to the replicated volume.<p>It's real use is in building high-availability services -- since the ""mirrored"" disks aren't in the same box, you can have an up-to-the-second copy of the data there. The two systems don't even have to be in the rack next to each other, which is a tough trick to pull off with normal hardware RAID.<p>As I said in my other comment, though, it is a lot slower than native disk writes.",1204154124

5658485,comment,5658478,5658478,1,0,msabalau,,,"What's striking to me is the extent to which the past decade's innovations (ad supported web services, carrier subsidized smartphones) have shifted people's perceptions of a reasonable price for technology. Especially for early adopters, who canonically paid more, and got less, and did so willingly play around with an unevenly distributed bit of the future.<p>For example, the Apple 1 motherboard (to which one needed to add both effort and other parts) costed a diabolical $666.66 in 1976, at a time when the US median income was $11,308.  According to a friendly internet inflation calculator, that's $2727.25 in current dollars.<p>Flash forward to the 80s, and one of the early important popular personal computers debuted for $595 in 1982, or $1435 in current dollars, roughly the price of the Glass prototype today.  If you pre ordered it before launch, they'd throw in a cassette drive, so that you would have a place to store programs, as opposed to having to type them in.  This was a $70 value.<p>Thanks to Moore's Law and mass market adoption the price of these innovations, as with so many others came down in price, and afforded more a more capabilities to a broader and broader audiences. This was true for almost all personal technology that succeeded from the 70s through the 90s, and is true for many technologies today--such as 3D printing.<p>It is however strikingly not true for a lot of the web based services that people   call to mind when they think of innovation today--it was free to join Twitter, say, and as an early adopter you didn't own something with less features than later adopters--instead you potentially had a first mover advantage, the ability to achieving a critical mass of followers in a way that latecomers might find harder.  You paid in attention, a pretty cheap coin, which nevertheless does little to stop the whining when a service disappears after an acquihire.<p>What's remarkable to someone who isn't in their 20s is that anyone would, well, remark on the fact that cutting edge technology that is actually built and manufactured in the real world would follow this path.<p>If wearables do become an important tech trend, and unless they rapidly follow the very unusual path that smartphones took (arguably the most rapidly adopted technology in human history), pricing could be very different from what people have come to associate with innovation.",1367765828

Then there are technologies that people decide to <i>make other people</i> use. Design quality is much higher in the first category (badly-conceived ones die out) than in the second.<p>Most of what you encounter in a corporate software setup is in the second category. It's built to sell well to IT managers, not be productive and fun to use, because the people who will actually work with the product don't get a vote. It's not so simple as to apply this to languages (Java is the right tool for some purposes) but you get a feel for it after programming in a variety of environments.

5658398,comment,5658135,5658135,1,0,drostie,,,"First off, you need to understand what DNS does.<p>There is a non-profit in Los Angeles called ICANN with a department called IANA, and this non-profit gives several companies special monopolies on selling ""top-level domains"" -- those companies are, in principle, ""domain name registrars"". So, for example, I have the domain drostie.org; this is in the .org top-level domain, which is maintained by the Public Interest Registry.<p>When you want to look up ""drostie.org"", your computer first looks up the ICANN servers and asks, ""who's responsible for .org?"" and it gives a server at PIR. It then asks the PIR server, ""who's responsible for drostie.org?"" and it gives my web host's IP address.<p>So ICANN does not need to know directly, but PIR's computers needs to know. Here is where the registry steps in: PIR does not deal with you directly, but through a middleman. The middleman allows you to manage your .org domains through the same interface as your .com domains even though these are managed by different companies with different back-ends; it also in some sense reduces the sheer number of clients and transactions which PIR needs to engage in.<p>Thus in a strict philosophical sense you cannot avoid ""going through a registrar"" because in some sense PIR is a registrar -- ""registry"" is right in the title, even. You could try, if you were enough of a company, to do direct business with PIR, but that might set you up for numerous headaches if all you want is a working domain.<p>Typical prices are generally less than $15/year for a domain purchased through normal channels; Gandi and NameCheap are two popular registrars which people are usually happy with; GoDaddy is popular but has a bad reputation generally. A couple of those dollars go to ICANN, a couple go to PIR, and the rest goes to the middleman.",1367763865

I'm not in the least surprised, primarily because of the traction/inertia that ebay has now. A bit of an  orthogonal take: Chuck-e-Cheese sucks, I mean really-really donkey balls sucks ass, bad food, boring entertainment, a viral haven, I feel dirty after being there, but parents still take their kids there in droves. Why? cultural inertia, <i>because everyone else does it, we'll do it too</i>. Stereotype, joe sixpack, soccer mom, sheep, lemmings, hive mentality, whatever you want to call it, its the same thing. That is tough to break these habits. I mean, look at McDonalds. I don't see any redeeming value eating there but tons of people do. Its like the saying, ""eat shxx, a billion flies can't be wrong."" OK, done with rant, mod me into oblivion for bashing our cultural icons.",1212296381
205665,comment,205600,205600,0,0,noonespecial,,,"You're looking for another, larger dinosaur to come along and eat ebay. Instead what is likely to happen is many smaller mammals like cragslist and <a href=""http://www.etsy.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.etsy.com/</a> will come along and slowly make it irrelevant.<p>They are certainly speeding the process along with their mistreatment of the most important kinds of sellers and allowing the rampant spam and fraud that has nearly taken over whole sections.<p>When ebay began the web was a very different place. The rise of social networking and basic online shopping awareness will allow smaller niche markets like etsy to flourish. A reputation system that is portable, secure and inter-operates easily would be a big plus in this direction but I think it will happen even without it being fully developed.<p>I can't wait for an online market of makers that can offer unique, one-off technology products. I'd gladly trade in my Ipod for a funky handmade OS Ogg player that did more of what I want and less of what Apple wants. Reputation built by how many cool things you've made, commissioned items.. Hey there's a startup in there somewhere!",1212296236
205664,comment,205600,205600,0,0,andr,,,"If you want to be the next eBay you need to be radically different from the current one. You can't just one-up them.<p>One thing I've been thinking about is using double-sided auctions instead of the typical second-price English auction you find at eBay. The idea is that buyers leave bids and sellers leave offers for a particular item class, rather than for a particular item ""instance"". For each class of item (e.g., 2GB iPod nano) you would essentially have a market similar to the stock market. You can leave an offer or a bid or you can act on a bid or an offer that is already left by somebody else.<p>This will be a much more efficient market than eBay, so the forces of supply and demand will be stronger. Buyers will be able to choose between speed of sale and profit. On average, buyers will have less of an advantage against sellers - things will be more balanced.<p>Overall, this greatly decreases the transaction cost, which is the cost of the time and effort to research the item, determine the veracity of the listing, and devise a bidding strategy. In a way, the market has already done the research for you.<p>In addition, it removes the wait until the auction expires. If I want to buy an iPod for $200 and you want to sell it for $200 we can close the transaction immediately.<p>The market principle won't be so strong with rarer items, but people will be able to show demand for rare items before sellers list them.<p>The major problem  is the adequate clustering of similar offers (e.g., all 2GB iPod Nanos). It needs to be done automatically, so this idea becomes to eBay what Powerset is to Google.",1212295977

205658,comment,205572,205651,0,0,DaniFong,,,"Depending on who you are, you could guard against javascript being rewritten by a man in the middle attack by running, say, a greasemonkey script that figures out when a password should be sent and hashing with the server domain automagically, so long as you can cache it locally. In this way, admins could secure clients against having their passwords stolen without any effort on the part of web-app writers, or users. Even a browser, say, Firefox, could do some version of this.<p>Really, digest authentication solves the same problem, but hardly anyone uses it.",1212295624

205652,comment,205420,205460,0,0,rplevy,,,"One approach is to invent a mnemonic system for constructing secure passwords.  The passwords should be systematically related to the specific site (including variables that are only known or relevant to you), but the patten should not be obvious to anyone but yourself (and memorable enough that the passwords & method of constructing do not need to be explicitly recorded).  This makes it possible to have a unique password for every site.  As a further foil to anyone who might somehow crack the pattern, use different mental password construction algorithms for sites with different levels of perceived security importance (although then it is easier to get confused).",1212295102
205651,comment,205572,205572,0,0,jsjenkins168,,,"As was pointed out by tptacek, this approach is not secure because the javascript can be rewritten in transit. Also consider that javascript-based hashing will be extremely slow and could interfere with the user experience if the browser bogs down. And IE may show an error that performance is slow on your site.<p>There just is no way around it, the only way to be secure is  use SSL to share secrets when you register. From then on you can just transmit an authenticator (stored in a secure cookie) comprised of an expiration timestamp, any identifying user data (like userID), and a non-malleable MAC digest of the expiration and userID. Doesn't protect against replay but it helps to enforce a short expiration for the authenticator. With this approach you'll only need to use SSL for the initial login.<p>This is the best explanation of web authentication I've encountered on the net [PDF]:<p><a href=""http://prisms.cs.umass.edu/~kevinfu/papers/webauth_tr.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://prisms.cs.umass.edu/~kevinfu/papers/webauth_tr.pdf</a>",1212295072

I do try and make an effort to read UI books but the effort is no way even close to what I do trying to tinker with all things coding related.  Unfortunately, while there is an element of genius/talent/""born with it"", it is ultimately a matter of hard work (a saying about perspiration and inspiration by Edison comes to mind).",1212294685

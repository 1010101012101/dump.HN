5138324,comment,5135187,5136184,1,0,jasondenizac,,,"timeout IDs are similar in a sense. By having the promise as an object, you can do neat things to modify program control flow as a separate concern from resolving a particular asynchronous operation. Sure, you can compose promises, just like you might with callback-oriented code. But you can also do neat things like await an object graph of mixed synchronous and promised values, eg: <a href=""https://npmjs.org/package/resolved"" rel=""nofollow"">https://npmjs.org/package/resolved</a>",1359525585

5138316,comment,5135789,5136422,1,0,codeonfire,,,"""I've often wondered why so few companies make a concerted effort to seek out talent rather than credentials.""<p>You have to realize how there is a huge, huge amount of people incredibly full of shit.  Everybody thinks, or at least says, that they are an expert hacker.  The problem is that invariably someone who overstated and overestimated their skills makes it inside a company.  Then the bullshit really starts flying.  They want to hire their no skills friend, or sibling, or spouse because $$$.  They talk them up and try to bully anybody who is against hiring the person. Suddenly it appears on the surface that the company IS trying to hire based on 'talent' or at least one persons biased perception of it.  Talent is not going to work in the typical political business environment.  Next, you go with degrees.  Does your self serving friend hire at least have a degree?  No? well too bad for you and your friend.<p>When you talk about ""talent"" it's almost funny because of how awful reality actually is in hiring.  When anyone tries to talk up themselves or their friends, all anybody can think is 'full of shit.'  When somebody says they dropped out and taught themselves, its 'full of shit.'  When somebody says that the best employees don't need to go to college, its 'full of shit.'  Do you think people who have heard and seen every lie out there are just going to take a person's word for it?",1359525474

5138298,comment,5132343,5135794,1,0,biomechanica,,,"I am dismissing the ""convenience"" factor simply to prove a point. I am under no illusion that there needs to be better alternatives out there that fill in the gaps. However, it is also important to note that while there is certainly a convenience factor that some people (or perhaps even most people) will gravitate to, there are also other factors to consider. Freedom, being one. Now, I'm not one to badger people about what Freedoms you can/will lose while using a centralized service such as Facebook or Google, but I do think it's important to  recognize the serious problems those services pose.<p>I also think it's important to not get off track from my original point which is: It is not the end of your social life if you decide to delete your facebook account (or google or twitter etc.). That is my point.<p>I emphasize ""open"" because those technologies are open for review by thousands of eyes. If there are privacy issues it will be known and tended to. Using something like Skype does not ensure your privacy; especially since now it is more centralized and not p2p. There has been many articles released about the privacy concerns of using Skype (wiretapping, China, etc.). I, for one, do not ever want to put my privacy in the back seat for the sake of convenience and I think it's imperative to educate or at least mention the problems with closed technologies that are supposed to be ""private"".<p>Jitsi, as far as I can tell, runs on Windows, Mac and Linux. Those platforms are pretty much covered. I'm not sure if it runs on Android or iOS. Though, I'm sure there are people working on mobile solutions (I am, at least). I wouldn't dismiss it so easily. Skype runs like utter crap on Linux systems and while Jitsi may not run all that well compared to Skype, it is at least open sourced and free software so people can work on it.<p>Email is essentially a social network. A social network is simply, at its core, a system which allows friends/family/other to communicate and keep up to date with each other. In fact, I would go so far as to say the original social network is not Facebook or MySpace but the Internet itself.<p>Again, I'm not trying to suggest there are alternatives that can completely replace Facebook (or others) convenience factor. Not at all. I am simply saying, you don't need it.",1359525024

5138296,comment,5138107,5138281,3,0,niggler,,,"If they paid dividends, it would have been returned to the shareholders (both long and short)<p>At the end of the day, buybacks benefit those who tender shares into the buyback at the expense of the other shareholders (the buyback would have to happen at a price above the market price at the time of the buyback, so that net loss is attributed to people who are still holding the stock.)  This would be worthwhile if the company can grow earnings and profits enough to compensate for the short-term expense, but that doesn't happen most of the time.<p>Taking the long view, dell was $15/sh back then.  If you just held for 16 years you'd be down nearly $2/sh.  If they paid a dividend instead of a buyback, you'd have received at least $20 in dividend during that time (and the stock price, all else equal, would be higher)",1359524968
5138295,comment,5137474,5138014,7,0,kareemm,,,"This is by design.  Restaurants will sometimes only give OpenTable a few slots a night as OT often takes a good chunk of margin from the restauranteurs:<p>'The access fees can be substantial, particularly for restaurants operating on thin margins. One independent study estimates that OpenTable’s fees (comprised of startup fees, fixed monthly fees, and per-person reservation fees) translate to a cost of roughly $10.40 for each “incremental” 4-top booked through OpenTable.com.  To put that in perspective, consider that the average profit margin, before taxes, for a U.S. restaurant is roughly 5%. This means that a table of 4 spending $200 on dinner would generate a $10 profit.  In this example, all of that profit would then go to OpenTable fees for having delivered the reservation, leaving the restaurant with nothing other than the hope that that customer would come back (and hopefully book by telephone the next time).'<p>From <a href=""http://insidescoopsf.sfgate.com/blog/2010/10/18/is-opentable-worth-it/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://insidescoopsf.sfgate.com/blog/2010/10/18/is-opentable...</a>",1359524953

The only difference is that the undergraduate Head TAs are typically ""higher"" in the food chain of responsibility than the Graduate TAs (who are more responsible for course development). This worked incredibly well: in 2011, one of our three intro sequences (the one meant for people who knew they wanted to do CS, but don't have the background in it) went from an enrollment of 70 students to 200. We managed by scaling the undergraduate TA group from 11 to 20 (with two, instead of one, HTA), and assigning a good number of those TAs to work on better automation for things like grading.<p>I've been a TA for three years now, and I've probably gotten more from it than from my actual classes. And because we see what the class needs to teach, as well as what the class has taught in the past, we're actually a lot better (IMHO) than grad students (and even many professors) at figuring out how to change the course to push students further.<p>As our professor last year put it:\n""I am the Pope of CS17.

Lots of ""publishing"" applications will melt very quickly if Rails ever ends up serving dynamic requests. Instead, you cache everything, either on disk with Nginx, in Memcached, or in Varnish.<p>But you <i>know</i> when the data is changing -- when an article has been updated and republished ... or when you've done another load of the government dataset that's powering your visualization. Waiting for a user request to come in and then caching your response to that (while hoping that the thundering herd doesn't knock you over first) is backwards, right?<p>I think it would be fun to play around with a Node-based framework that is based around this inverted publishing model, instead of the usual serving one. The default would be to bake out static resources when data changes, and you'd want to automatically track all of the data flows and dependencies within the application. So when your user submits a change, or your cron picks up new data from the FEC, or when your editor hits ""publish"", all of the bits that need to be updated get generated right then.<p>It's only a small step from there to pushing down the updates to Backbone models for active users ... but one step at a time, right? No need to couple those things together.<p>ps. Kudos to you for reading the source.

We have a two 20 drive &#x27;boxes&#x27; (40 drives) from Western Digital, as drives fail we pull replacements from the &#x27;new/refurbished&#x27; box, and we put the dead one in the outgoing box. When we get up to 20 we RMA them in bulk, 20 go out, 20 more come in. That becomes the new &#x27;new/refurbished&#x27; box.<p>It really isn&#x27;t SAN vs non-SAN it is all statistics.<p>That said, if you&#x27;re running your ReadyNAS with raid 10 (mirrored drives in a RAID 0 config) you may find some unpleasantness when a drive does fail.

9909444,comment,9908755,9909259,0,0,lsc,,,"> the situation we&#x27;re in right now with advertising is like medieval warfare with the advent of the crossbow -- a great imbalance in favor of the attacker that disrupted the nature of combat for centuries.<p>(totally off topic, but)<p>hm.   I thought that the crossbow was a little like the early fireams, in that it wasn&#x27;t particularly <i>better</i> than what came before, mostly due to it&#x27;s terribly slow rate of fire;  it was just easier to use.<p>My understanding was that someone skilled with a longbow was a more effective fighter, especially in terms of rate of fire, but also in terms of armor penetration  and range than someone with a crossbow or a early firearm.  (my understanding was that early firearms were massively effective at dealing with armor at very close ranges, but that effectiveness dropped off very quickly.   Crossbows suffered from similar issues, in a less dramatic sort of way.)<p>However, becoming really good with a longbow was a serious undertaking, one that took up a significant portion of your time  over a lifetime.<p>The crossbow and the early firearms, from what I read, were superior in that you could give them to a bunch of shopkeepers or construction workers or what have you, have them drill every third Saturday, and have someone who was a semi-effective warrior when it came time for battle.<p>back on-topic, I... think there&#x27;s a hole in our schooling;  one the greeks had down.   Rhetoric.  Most students don&#x27;t study it.  And most of that manipulation of other people (at least if you use words) falls under rhetoric.<p>Incidentally, I am given to understand that rhetoric and logic were often taught together.  Formal logic gets more academic time than rhetoric, I think, but I think that explicitly teaching logic with rhetoric says important things about logic and how it ought to be applied to argument.   This idea that we need to apply logic to our arguments before applying rhetoric is a cultural value that we don&#x27;t have, that the greeks did.  I mean, I&#x27;m the first to call the greeks assholes, and to remind everyone that they had slaves, that they were not good people and that we should not follow them in all things.  But we have chosen to model our education systems after theirs, and this is one of the things they did that I think we should do, too.<p>In fact, I&#x27;ve been looking for a modern academic-ish rhetoric text;   all I&#x27;ve found so far are a bunch of pop psychology style books, while I strongly prefer a more academic presentation.<p>But yeah;  I think in this case, understanding what other people are doing to manipulate you is how you disarm them.",1437263043

Having a separate device for music means I don&#x27;t need to feel guilty about wasting phone battery when listening to music.<p>2) Storage. I tend to use very little storage on my phone, mostly due to the fact that I keep my 40+ GB music collection on a separate device. This means I can usually go for the model with the lowest storage for any phone I&#x27;m interested in, and not have to limit myself to phones with expandable storage (that seems to be on the way out as a trend).<p>3) Sound quality. I&#x27;m not talking about the placebo-heavy issues that audiophiles concern themselves with.

Virtually all news and media companies. Sure, it is a bit nefarious to do some of the things that get done on the internet like trackers and info siloing and such, but seriously? Is not seeing an advert a moral imperative?<p>> I want to keep using this free email, social network, enhanced and personalized search capability, free cloud storage, document collaboration, real time news updates, weather, be entertained by television, be entertained by blogs, participate in an online community, etc<p>ok awesome, pay us money then, $1 a month per website/service you use?<p>> no<p>Or even the more infuriating, of course I would do that. Would you? Would you pay for google, facebook, twitter, reddit, HN, new york times, bloomberg? Maybe, but how much would you pay to that website your friend linked in an email? How many of you have apps or work at companies that get paid by advert revenue?<p>In a world where is is insanely easy to block ads, or to just ignore them, surely this isn&#x27;t a question of morality. More of triviality and annoyance. I have 3 adblock extensions + uBlock as well as a DNS killer. I HATE ads. The reason ads are so annoying is because I have all of these things. So now companies search exploits to get my data to sell it and load tons of JS libraries to break through all of the blocking software I have. The situation sucks, but it isn&#x27;t morality.<p>tl;dr If you think Axe body spray will get you laid, you are weak minded.

For example - &quot;Create a basic CRUD app, with testing, in a configured environment&quot; or some such takes time for me to set up, write, test, and package for delivery.<p>For me as an interviewee, to have to devote hours of my time doing work for free just to prove that I know how to code, all based on a short phone call, is just as crazy. How do I know your company is one I want to work for? How do I know you&#x27;re offering the salary and benefits I need? We haven&#x27;t gotten to that part of the conversation yet and I&#x27;m already putting in real hours of work - especially if I have multiple interviewers that ask me to complete code challenges.<p>It&#x27;s a catch-22 really.  If you have no hurdles, you hire people who don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re doing.  If you put too many hurdles, you scare off the folks who don&#x27;t want to waste hours of their time proving they know the basics.  For an interviewer, it&#x27;s best to get this stuff right up front so you can more effectively screen, but for the interviewee it&#x27;d be best that this comes at the end of the process when they know they actually want the job.<p>All in all, I think this works better for junior level positions because that&#x27;s where you want to know where folks are at, but hiring senior level people with years of experience, it just gets insulting to have to jump through hoops at every single interview.

As for getting fired within a month, it won&#x27;t happen.

His response &quot;just so we&#x27;re both clear, you&#x27;re telling me, not asking me, because I&#x27;d be really uncomfortable if you felt like you had to ask.&quot;<p>Performance: Coworkers are generally really high performers, people genuinely care, but the tendency to hire senior employees means a lot of family people, and there is work life balance. There is no &quot;stack ranking&quot; system in place and to my knowledge there never has been.<p>Unlimited stock contribution being a bonus for already rich employees: Really? Really?! I say this as someone who came in with a negative net worth and no cash flow. You&#x27;re taking risk in exchange for potential reward with the stock plan. Those who are rich can afford to take more risk, and they are taking more risk by putting more in. Sure maybe not risk of ruin but there is financial risk. What&#x27;s wrong with this? it&#x27;s been lucrative, I was considered a &quot;heavy contributor&quot; by company standards but pretty light compared to some I talked to.<p>Expectations: You set and manage these for yourself. Sometimes you screw then up. This is sometimes a challenge for me, but it&#x27;s entirely within my own influence. This quarter I set lower commitments and took the first month off.

Many years ago I purchased 4x 2TB 5900 RPM drives for a 4 bay ReadyNAS (cost about ~$300 for drives plus ReadyNAS). They have been spinning nonstop for ~4 years [1] and haven&#x27;t had to replace a single one. Not even an increase in errors to signal that the drive is going.<p>Yet - I&#x27;ve worked on a SAN that cost hundreds of thousands of dollars and would have to replace a disk about every month.<p>Granted the disks in SANs probably spin faster (thus faster data access/lower MTBF) - but that high failure rate seems rather suspicious to me.<p>[1] <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/NRQCedj.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/NRQCedj.png</a>",1437261247

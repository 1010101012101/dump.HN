(This would explain a lot.)</i><p>The reason it's slow is that the compositing engine requires that the YV12 -> RGB conversion be done in software rather than in a hardware overlay.  This is probably exacerbated by the fact that many sites <i>still</i> seem to turn off the hardware accelerated display out.  Note that as far as I know, all current implementations of HTML 5 video have a similar problem (compositing engine requires RGB input).<p>It's based on Mainconcept's decoder, which while not incredibly fast, isn't particularly slow either.  Though I wouldn't be surprised if Adobe stripped out some of the assembly to try to make it smaller (or compiled it with -Os).<p>My advice for performance would be to disable CABAC; that can probably save 15-25% decoding time right off the bat at the cost of 10-25% compression.",1254290023

People disagree with you.<p>First, there's no realistic world in which all of a sudden everyone is using different plugins. Almost nobody in the world has the kind of distribution that Google does. Very few people could pull this off, and I doubt even Google can.<p>Second, if there were a way to get users to install plugins 99% of the time, then we wouldn't have half the issues we currently do. You act like it would be a bad thing to test for the availability of plugins which enabled new features. It wouldn't be. It would actually be quite awesome.<p>Third, Chrome Frame is exactly the same as Chrome, so, at least in theory, there is NO NEED to test for anything knew. Even if every browser did this, there would be NO NEW browsers. There may be some implementation gotchas, but I don't see the same kind of doomsday scenario you do.<p>Anyway, I think it's highly unlikely Chrome Frame goes anywhere at all.",1254289741

Pretty much everywhere they use one of those phrases it should be qualified like ""X _say they_ like Y"".  But that gets tedious, and I think the authors are also making the assumption that you were paying attention when they explained where these numbers come from.<p>Note that the end of the article is leading directly into the objections that people keep making along the lines of ""this doesn't mean that these people really get along in real life"", and the conflict between what people say they are looking for and the choices they actually make about who to contact and respond to.",1254289609

Have you been to mostly-women gatherings before?<p>I believe that if people go to an event expecting to be treated as an outsider, they will behave in a way that will discourage people from welcoming them.<p>It's true that some number of guys have treated some women as lesser beings at tech conferences, but it's also true that some number of guys have treated other guys as lesser beings at tech conferences.   Geeks are competitive and cliquish.   It may be that way with people into crocheting, too;  I would almost expect it.    But my experience has been that most people are pretty accepting if you show some persistence and genuine interest.",1254289523

851970,comment,851889,851951,0,0,SystemOut,,,"One of the biggest problems we've run into doing h264 streaming is that there are a huge number of users that don't have powerful enough computers to decode and view h264 in a flash player when it's delivered at 720p.  You need a pretty fast system to watch 720p video at even 3 Mbps in the Flash player.<p>And h264 over HTTP is just a download of the HTTP file starting from a specific marker unless I'm mistaken. Not exactly rocket science. It's HTTP after all...you can't control much of anything on the QOS side. The JW player has the capability to do that out of the box for most of the major CDN networks out there already.",1254288924

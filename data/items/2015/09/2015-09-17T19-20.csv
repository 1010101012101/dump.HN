But I made the mistake of buying a used router that was managed by a ISP. They built their own firmware and purposefully made the firmware updater require specific headers in the firmware package. Now I can&#x27;t update this device to OpenWRT, without some very specific hacking and compiling my own version of OpenWRT.<p>Who owns this hardware? I bought it. I paid for it. Its in my house. But apparently this ISP is truly the owner and I can&#x27;t do anything that I wish with this device.<p>The firmware is based on Linux, the ISP of course hasn&#x27;t released their source. The only way I know about the header bit is because somebody else figured this out years ago and there is a single message on a random web forum detail it.<p>Presumably, the &quot;openness&quot; of the original device running Linux is what allowed them to build their own custom firmware in the first place.",1442519939

Having open access articles/papers, we are now moving to open availability of data for reproducibility of results. Open tools are the third component, allowing a complete reproducibility of research, unencumbered by arbitrary lock-in.
It is then important that we teach and share open and free tool with science learners, so that as they progress they can freely share fully reproducible research, with anyone in the world.<p>[edit] in summary, in the age of open access, FLOSS science tools become a must -- and a collective responsibility.",1442519915

You have a village and someone plants an apple tree. Everybody who wants an apple has to pay to the owner (planter). Now let&#x27;s say (to make it less politically controversial) that the owner dies, and the village decides that anyone in the village can take, say, 10 apples per month.<p>I would then say the apples are free, wouldn&#x27;t you? It perfectly fits the definition of the word.<p>And this is analogous to technological innovation. Someone spent time creating this innovation in the past, and the products of this innovation can be free, you don&#x27;t have to pay anyone to use it, they are already dead.<p>So I have shown you, I hope, that free things can appear &quot;out of thin air&quot; in the economy.

In most cases those invoices tend to fall under the &quot;petty cash&quot; category so they are often not very well checked and if you send out 500,000 invoices a year to companies even a small percentage of those being paid is still a nice take.<p>Now back to financial organizations, you can&#x27;t just make a transfer from bank a to bank b and expect it to work there will be huge scrutiny on even fairly small sums, yet alone millions, the funds will also be frozen for a quite long period of time (2-3 business days at the least) and in many cases will not be liquid for at least another such period.<p>And most importantly regular bank transactions can be reversed and those which can&#x27;t are insured.<p>Bitcoin exchanges seem to be too cool to adopt the same level of regulatory mandated processes that even the smallest financial institution has to adopt. And the fact that pretty much not a single Bitcoin exchange is insured against fraud and the fact that bitcoin transactions are for the most part &quot;anonymous&quot; and there is no way to revoke, or reverse them means that even the smallest case of fraud can bring down the entire exchange.",1442518659

I was given a roof over my head, free education, food, security, and medical care by my parents and I didn&#x27;t have to do anything for that.  I never saw our house being built, nor food being grown, or took a class in economics(by 18 I took several later).  By 18 I still understood that work is needed to create things.  Someone in sub-Saharan Africa has probably helped maintain their house, been knitting their own clothes, and maybe even planting and helping farm since they were 14.  Then if someone gives them a bed net they suddenly discount all of their previous experience and believe that things are spontaneously created?<p>It seems to me you&#x27;re argument is &quot;if you give things to sub-Saharan Africans they start to think that work doesn&#x27;t leads to things being made&quot;. This would be contrary to all the evidence around them.  Specifically all of the things they are making on a daily basis.  And this effect is so strong it overpowers the net positive of getting a bed net.  If this were true then communities given a free net would do substantially worse than communities that pay a nominal fee for bed nets.  All of the evidence I&#x27;ve seen shows that communities given free nets do better than ones that pay a nominal fee.<p>This is very counter intuitive theory.

A culture of honesty and trust is better for the experience of each individual employee, and for the company as a whole.<p>Unfortunately, the OP is right about one thing -- one individual liar in a workplace of honest people will likely get ahead.

If the sequence of operations is visible to attacker (via power, time, cache, branch predictor, etc.) then your secret key does, too.<p>So, ECC implementations are not generally in a better state than RSA.<p>This is why curve25519 and its ilk are so much better; they can be efficiently implemented using the Montgomery ladder which is really very easy <i>and cheap</i> to make free of side-channels.",1442517230

Then they gave examples of good engineers who were fresh grads, or were let go at other jobs and have no backup offers. In those instances, managers tried to low-ball or drive down salary.

10235408,comment,10233831,10233831,0,0,JoshDoody,,,"This is a really good story, and it drives home the famous @patio11 mantra: Charge more! (Even when you&#x27;re an employee who charges a company a salary for your work.) This is an amazing success story that drives home the importance of knowing your value and using that knowledge to get paid what you&#x27;re worth. Very cool :)<p>Some more thoughts...<p><i>Aggression</i><p>Your tactics are <i>very</i> strong and aggressive. If you&#x27;re truly indispensable, this level of aggression can pay off in a big way. Two factors go into figuring out how aggressive you can/should be:<p>1. How badly the company needs you. 
2. How badly you need them.<p>This seems obvious, but I think a lot of people overlook the relationship between those two things and your ability to negotiate aggressively.<p>The more they need you, and the less you need them, the more aggressive you can be. In this case, it sounds like you knew they needed you <i>badly</i> and you had many other options and little loyalty to the company, so you didn&#x27;t need them very much. This is a situation where strong aggression is merited.<p><i>Knowing your market value</i><p>I especially like that you went and got <i>real</i> offers from other companies. This is the best way to estimate your market value—a key step to complete <i>before</i> jumping into a salary negotiation. If you can find out what other companies pay for your skill set and experience, and if you can determine what your current company will pay for your skill set and experience, you know how hard you can push.<p><i>Knowing your minimum acceptable salary</i><p>You didn&#x27;t mention this, but I think it&#x27;s implicit: It&#x27;s also important to set your minimum acceptable salary before the negotiation. What&#x27;s the absolute minimum you will accept in order to take the job or stay with the company? This is your &quot;walk away&quot; number, and it can be a very, very potent tool when you&#x27;re negotiating. Pre-deciding this number gives you total control over your situation and helps avoid any knee-jerk decisions that you may regret later. Knowing your market value can help set this number accounting for more than personal feelings.<p>Here are a few more thoughts on things I might recommend doing differently (since I know a lot of people will read your post and hope to emulate your success).<p><i>I recommend witholding your desired salary</i><p>When you were looking elsewhere for opportunities, you said, &quot;They asked me what my other company offered, and I said $60k (a lie, I added $14k to the original offer). They offered me $58k plus a $7k performance bonus, for a theoretical $65k package.&quot; It is not a coincidence that the company&#x27;s offer was <i>slightly</i> less than the number you told them.<p>And again when you tell your employer about your other offer: &quot;I went back to my original employer and said I had a new job offer for $70k, and I didn&#x27;t want to negotiate, I just wanted their final, last ditch offer. This removed any potential for skilled negotiators to outwit me. Later that night they emailed me an offer for $66k and a few thousand more shares.&quot; Again, it&#x27;s not a coincidence that they offered <i>slightly</i> less than the offer you had on the table.<p>Rather than telling them your desired salary, or what other offers you had on the table, I recommend simply kindly refusing to disclose these numbers. You very likely would have been better off using one of my favorite lines: &quot;I want this move to be a big step forward in terms of both responsibility and compensation.&quot;<p>In fact, your story sort of bears this out. They obviously had a LOT more headroom for salary, and yet the salary you got was always <i>slightly</i> less than you had requested.<p><i>I don&#x27;t recommend lying</i><p>A few times, you determined your market value by getting offers at other companies, then went back to your employer and lied about those offers at your company. This worked out for you, but seems pretty risky. Why lie? If they fact-check you at all, you&#x27;ll be in a pretty awkward position of explaining the lies.<p>Instead, just don&#x27;t tell them the numbers at all :)<p>If you were going to demand their best-possible offer <i>anyway</i>, why not just demand their best offer without giving them an anchor?<p><i>I think yours was a special case, but is still illustrative</i><p>As I mentioned above, you were <i>very</i> aggressive here, demanding a raise and threatening to leave multiple times. Most people probably cannot get away with this sort of aggression and will end up either leaving or having their bluff called pretty often. (I don&#x27;t think you were bluffing here, which is why you could be so aggressive as I mentioned above.) I just point this out so those who may want to emulate your succes are aware that yours were <i>very</i> aggressive tactics that may often result in separation from the company or bad blood within the company if managers feel that you will constantly demand raises under threat of leaving.<p>I&#x27;m publishing a book on salary negotiation very soon.

I really like my job. It&#x27;s at a stable company with around 700 people. The pay is adequate but not fantastic. The environment, while frantic at times, is awesome. I also get lots of smaller but very pleasant perks like a free gym and an amazing view of my city&#x27;s downtown.<p>I got contacted by a recruiter last week regarding a job as a senior programmer at a local startup. 99% of the time I ignore recruiter spam, but several things jumped out at me: I&#x27;m almost perfectly qualified (on paper anyways), the listed pay is slightly more than 1.7 times my currently salary, and the job is located in a suburb that&#x27;s closer to my house than my current job.<p>I did a phone interview and that went very well. They gave me a small take home project to do and apparently they were &quot;very impressed&quot; with what I turned in according to the CEO.<p>I&#x27;ve got an in person interview tomorrow with their CEO. Given the way things are going so far I&#x27;m not at all worried about what they&#x27;ll ask me. What I am worried about however is: what should I ask them?<p>The company has been around for 5ish years, has 18 people, and has raised greater than 5 and less than 10 million in series B funding. Supposedly the job would have me doing more or less what I do now. The only difference is that I would be managing other programmers and instead of working on a wide variety of different projects I would be working on a small handful.<p>I&#x27;ve never worked at a company like that before. Normally I wouldn&#x27;t be so worried about what to ask them, just about getting the job. But, I really do like where I&#x27;m at and I don&#x27;t need a new job. If I&#x27;m going to switch companies I want to make sure I know they&#x27;re the right fit for me.<p>tl;dr - What can I ask them that will help me determine if they&#x27;re stable, have a long term plan, and are a good place to work?",1442516625

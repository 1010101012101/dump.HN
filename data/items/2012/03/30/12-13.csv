I may put in some real work to help the person. However, because the the level of difficulty of the question is higher, the level of understanding of the voter also needs to be higher to know if he/she should vote for the answer. Of course, there are other factors like the narrowness of applicability to a more difficult question and the time taken to even read the question if it is a longer one.",1333112209

I'm not a huge company that wants to hire Eric to help me 'get lean'. I'm one guy working alone with limited time, and really appreciate it when authors give me specific stuff I can do.

Apples to apples:  pick equivalent ultra-picky-with-membership team of talented programmers and then compare their artifacts' maintainability.  C is a fine language but the point of Java is that it lowers the bar (by dealing with hard problems e.g. GC) and makes it more accessible (look ma, no pointers).<p>A possibly controversial (but arguably viable) measure of ""Java and friends"" success is the explosion of ""complexity"" in software written in these languages.  My thesis is that IT league programmers would not have ventured to take spectacular architectural spacewalks in C or C++ but felt completely comfortable doing so in (say) Java.",1333112091

My reasoning follows.<p>Currently we program computers by giving them a set of instructions on how to achieve a goal.  As computers grow more powerful, we will stop giving detailed instructions.  Instead, we will write a general purpose deduction/inference engine, feed in a volume of raw data and let the computer derive the instructions it must follow to achieve the given goal.<p>There are two parts to such a system: the engine and the data.  The engine is something that free software is capable of producing.  The missing component is the data.  The wikidata project is this missing component.<p>I'm convinced that Wolfram Alpha is a glimpse of this future: an engine coupled to a growing body of structured data.  Wolfram's end game isn't taking over search, but taking over computer programming and ultimately reasoning.  It's just that search is currently a tractable problem for Alpha, one that can pay the bills until it becomes more capable.  There will come a day when Alpha is powerful enough to automatically translate natural language into structured data, at which point it will spider the Internet and its database and capabilities will grow explosively.<p>Free software needs Wikidata, to arrive at this endpoint first and avoid being made largely irrelevant by Alpha (or Google?)",1333111002

""standard"" of what?<p>There are meta-format standards: XML, RDF, HTML and lately JSON. With these four you are probably covering 80% of the world published open data, the rest is PDF, MS DOC and MS XLS.<p>That is missing, and good like filling this void, is a single format that you can use to describe everything. Personally, I think that such a single format will never exist and looking for one is pointless. Geographical data requires attention to certain details, music data to others; this means two different formats must be used (serialized through XML, RDF, HTML, whatever). If you are thinking about ""bridging"" different formats and data models, then, welcome to the world of RDF/S, OWL, TopicMaps ontologies (or ontologY), I'm not sure you want to live there :)<p>This new Wikidata, just like Freebase, is trying to collect structured or semi-structured data instead of unstructured data such as that present in Wikipedia. I am happy about the aim (completely unstructured data is basically useless for any serious data reuse and data extraction) but my fear is that they will not succeed as well as they did with Wikipedia. Wikipedia funded its success on the fact that anybody could edit it. In order to edit a wikipedia page you only need very low technical skills and basic writing skills (plus knowledge of the topic, obviously). Adding and manipulating structured data requires people to obey to a certain mental grid, to a formalized model, to a schema developed by someone and put in place to be respected strictly. The vast majority of people is easily demotivated when they are required to learn something substantial beforehand and most of the edits of unskilled users end up removed by watchdog (something seen often in high quality Wikipedia articles: edits made by new users are quickly reverted on the grounds that they did not follow some of the many guidelines that must be followed).<p>My idea is that many problems found in structured-data projects (FreeBase, MusicBrainz...) could be alleviated by better interfaces and a wide use of automation, both things that Wikipedia projects do not seem to excel in.",1333110772

I had seen it a few times before I started developing iOS applications, and on the surface, it never appealed to me at all. The idea to use it for anything never even crossed my mind, and looking at the sad state of GNUstep usage and the many modern Obj-C features GCC doesn't implement, I'd guess it's not really popular in the FOSS scene either.<p>Now that I have used Objective-C for some time, it would actually be a serious option anywhere I used to automatically pick C++ before. The more you learn about Obj-C and the more you use it, the more you will like it. It basically has most of the good things of C and C++ without many of their downsides, and it adds some almost Pythonesque dynamic features that are very useful and elegant.<p>IMO Objective-C deserves a little more credit than 'just the language Apple uses'",1333110667

3775593,comment,3771852,3775382,2,0,Lazare,,,"If you want an off-the-shelf solution, then you need two pieces - a markup parser and a template package.<p>The parser could be Textile, Markdown, RST, or various parsers implementing different wiki markups.  There are python libraries to implement almost anything you want.  Or you could write your own.<p>The parser goes through your content, and applies basic rules to translate it into HTML.  If you want a quick a dirty hack, just:<p><pre><code>  1. enumerate files in ""posts"" directory\n  2. sort by date edited\n  3. open each file in turn\n  4. read in contents and store as a string\n  5. chunk string by splitting on ""\n\n"" (ie, an empty line)\n  6. for each chunk, append <p> to output string\n  7. for each chunk, apply a regex to look pairs of *s\n  8. for each pair of *s, replace them with <b> and </b>\n  9. append the resulting chunk and a </p>\n  10. repeat 6-9 for each chunk\n  11. repeat 5-10 for each file until done\n</code></pre>\nThe end result of all that should probably be something like a dict, with a single key ""body"" container your post with <p> and <b> tags.  Add an author and date keys, and your ready to hand it off to your template system.<p>The problem comes if you want to do anything more than paragraphs and bold text, like, for example, a hyperlink, or an unordered list.  All of a sudden you will learn why using regexps to parse any sort of markup is a terrible idea.  It's like trying to fix a car engine with a toothbrush; even if you can make it work, you really shouldn't.  There's a lot of info on writing parsers with Python out there, and a bunch of parser modules you can use[1], but as far as I know the short of it is that it's really quite hard.  Either do some research on parsers and be prepared to devote a lot of time to it, or find one someone's already written is my advice.  (Either way, don't actually use regexps to try and make your own markup parser on the cheap.)<p>As for the template system, you could use Mustache, or Jinja 2, or if you're okay with going beyond Python, any of a hundred others, depending in what you want.  I'm quite fond of HAML syntax, but most of the template systems I know which speak HAML or a variant or written in Javascript or Ruby, for example.<p>If you want to write your own you'll face an easier task than for the parser step.  Again, you'll want to read in the template files, but the tokens your looking to replace are pretty simple.  Ideally they'll be something like: ""$$IDENTIFIER$$""; a regexp can easily find that, then you use the identifier as a key for your dictionary you got from your parser, and bob's your aunty.<p>The remaining trick is stuff like navigation.  A naive implementation will just process each file one at a time, which makes things like an archive page which lists every post you've made in each month tricky.  You can get around this by reprocessing every page every ""compile"", saving some metadata (like data and titles) and then generating your navigation, indexes, and archives.  If you're even smarter you can try and cache stuff so you don't need to recompile stuff that hasn't changed; this will require persisting metadata locally, presumably on the file system.<p>At some point you'll probably be tempted to drop in an SQLite database to store the metadata; this is pretty easy, but you might want to just run a full on CMS locally and cache the results to a file system.  Django has the Static Generator project[2], and Flask has something very similar.  These basically turn Django (or Flask) into a tool that will ""auto generate static HTML pages from a selection of page templates and a [database] of text"", which is more or less what you want.<p>(Of course, the static generation route is never going to make comments workable.  This may or may not be an issue for you, depending on how much you hate Disqus.)<p>[1]: For example, PLY:  <a href=""http://www.dabeaz.com/ply/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dabeaz.com/ply/</a>  If you look at that and go ""ah, this will be easy"" then knock yourself out.

Additionally: if users have to learn Rust as a new language, then they can use Ada anyway (which has a good track record, while there's no experience with Rust's possible quirks).\nAnd I guess if they ask AdaCore to include certain features as add-ons to their GNAT compiler, they'd do it or assist (because for fun and for the publicity that Firefox uses Ada).",1333109623

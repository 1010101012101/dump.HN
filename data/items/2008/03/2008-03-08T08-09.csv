In several other languages, you can't even write to standard output without importing a module or five, whereas in Python, you can get a lot done without even touching the standard library (although you will likely want to rather quickly). Seeing an import statement at the top might give the Python newbie the idea that core Python doesn't have ""basic"" functionality.<p>I think a good later lesson would be to explain how iterators and the standard library works and then revisit this code to make it look like your example, but in the beginning, I think range(10) would be simpler and would better serve the purpose of the lesson. Even in this case, xrange (at least in Python 2.x) is obviously the better choice, but introducing that complexity at this point doesn't gain much, in my opinion.",1204966667

131871,comment,131668,131805,0,0,BrandonM,,,"...except that a tar file really has nothing to do with compression at all. It's just a way of serializing a hierarchy of files into a single file, without any compression. The compression comes when you run gzip or bzip2 (typically using the -z or -j option to tar) on the tar file.",1204966202

He's pretty much universally reviled by every modern school of thought that I'm familiar with.<p>Anyhow, we're quickly veering away from the topic and toward the right margin.  We should probably take this to email.  My email address is on the page linked in my profile.",1204965688

131866,comment,131436,131863,0,0,curi,,,"Thomas Paine I know about. I read his book about the French Revolution -- the reply to Burke. It's really bad stuff. He doesn't understand Burke at all, makes bad arguments carelessly, and throws in lots of insults. (I realize I'm being insulting. Besides the low quality thinking he made excuses for massive bloodshed as well as glorifying some of it. And I have detailed notes with which I could back this up.)",1204965065

131863,comment,131436,131862,0,0,dfranke,,,"Bear in mind that the French Revolution began as something very different than what it became.  Thomas Paine, arguably the most libertarian of any of the founding fathers, was one of the French Revolution's most ardent American supporters in its early days.  After the revolution got hijacked by the Jacobins, Paine ended up in a French prison.<p>If you'd like, substitute Locke for Jefferson.",1204964664

The dates are around the time of the French Revolution. So, my guess is I dislike him. The French Revolution was really awful and revolutions in general are bad.",1204964385

131859,comment,131831,131831,0,0,dkokelley,,,"For adsense, it really depends on the subject. Is it a high or low paying subject? Some categories are ""worth"" more to advertisers so you'll receive more for each ad. This is what adjusts your CPM.<p>There is a sub-component of CPM when considering adsense and other forms of advertising, and that is your click through rate, and it's just the percentage of visitors who click on the ads. Many adsense ads only pay on clicks, which means that you'll have to design your site so that your ads are likely to be clicked on. Ads at or near the top of the page do better than those at the bottom of an article or hidden on a sidebar somewhere.<p>I can't tell you what Google pays for each click, because quite simply, Google doesn't know what it will get! It's all dependent on how valuable certain keywords are to advertisers.<p>A typical website running ads through an impression based ad network should earn about a $5 CPM. That number can go up to around $100 if it is a highly targeted and valuable demographic.<p>It would be difficult to tell you what the actual equation would be, because there are the previously mentioned variables that we can't accurately predict:<p>How valuable are the keywords you're offering?<p>What will your clickthrough rate be?<p>I hope this helps!",1204963879

My political thinking basically conforms to the framework laid out in <i>The Ethics of Liberty</i>.  The fact that I accept the label doesn't mean that I accept every word that Rothbard ever wrote as gospel.  I wouldn't expect any reasonable person to infer that I do, and nobody (reasonable or otherwise) has ever confronted me with such an accusation.

Given the objective outcome, a mental health care professional can either reshape your world view (which I don&#x27;t desire, because it&#x27;s a ridiculous vocabulary I don&#x27;t care to study again) or we can argue back and forth on theories about the human psyche, philosophize about various shared characteristics, and hope that somehow, abstractly, beneath this communication, lays something useful for the startup, code, math, logic, and so on.<p>The startup, the knowledge, the extending beyond the boundary of humanity TODAY is the goal. If you are completely alone in your life, then a health care professional can tell you objectively whether you are showering daily enough or not.

Revenue maximization is a modern religion. As we already discussed, Coase&#x27;s suggestion in 1959 that you should auction spectrum was novel and controversial.

(Nacnud&#x27;s comment is currently sitting at about -3 points.)<p>It&#x27;s unlikely that future technological advancements will give malware authors more tools to work with?  That seems unlikely, if history is any indication.<p>Imagine when you have 1TB of non-volatile storage which operates at speeds close to those we currently enjoy for DDR3 memory.  Most average consumers won&#x27;t use all of that space.  It seems entirely plausible that a virus will write itself to some area that is never overwritten.  It becomes a latent piece of malware, invisible to any filesystem, but activatable on demand by some other hard-to-detect malware.  This two-step scheme would be difficult to detect since the second component does nothing except activate the first component (stored in nonvolatile storage) under some specified criteria.<p>Or, how about key generation or password input?  Remember cperciva&#x27;s post about how it was extremely difficult or even impossible to zero a memory buffer correctly?  Now add in the idea that suddenly &quot;everything is nonvolatile&quot; and you get a perfect storm for security concerns: if a program segfaults or is terminated mid-operation, then suddenly any sensitive data it had spit out into memory might be capturable by other programs.  Or, since it&#x27;s nonvolatile, those secrets will persist &quot;forever&quot; (until they&#x27;re overwritten, which may be a long, long time if storage is plentiful) and you may inadvertently leak secrets when you sell your memristor-backed storage.  Whoever buys it can do some digging and uncover whatever was written into that buffer, if it&#x27;s truly non-volatile storage.<p>So, while the future is exciting, underestimating the security implications probably isn&#x27;t a good idea.  We can develop new methodologies to combat the new security concerns, but new security concerns will almost certainly come to fruition.  Of course, calling the concerns &quot;new&quot; is somewhat unfair, since new concerns are almost always very old concerns manifesting themselves in new domains, but new domains usually enable malware writers with new toolsets to exploit.",1415723127

This is not an app/site that makes it easier to send something to &quot;a loved one&quot;, it makes it easier to send something to <i>your</i> loved one.<p>Which is fine, except the site itself remains opaque about how it works or what it does. Are people really supposed to just start entering in things after the &quot;Dear Blake...&quot; prompt and hit send? There&#x27;s a prominent &quot;About&quot; link, but it&#x27;s not great UI/UX to force users to navigate your site just to figure out what the purpose of it is. The cynical person in me thinks this is an attempt to astroturf the justice system, so that supporters of Mr. Benthall can tout a media-friendly number of how many people have written on his behalf.<p>But the cynical UI designer in me thinks that what will happen is that a bunch of &quot;test/asdfjkljks&quot; messages will be sent off to the site&#x27;s maintainer, who will either just forward them to the prison or be overwhelmed with trying to filter signal from noise...and both scenarios do not seem very beneficial to Mr. Benthall.<p>I don&#x27;t want to judge intentions by quality/style of writing, but the About section is not very appealing to me. Telling me that Blake &quot;led a very normal life and was extremely kind, generous, and always willing to help&quot; just screams of an attempted saccharine whitewash. So I looked up  what Mr. Benthall is alleged to have done...and really, the allegations aren&#x27;t particularly ugly for him (e.g. he isn&#x27;t yet accused of hiring to kill someone). The About section should not be coy about the allegations, it smacks of dishonesty and is an insult to the audience.<p>However, I do applaud that the OP looked at the letter-sending process itself and found it to be &quot;obtuse&quot;. There probably is a need to reduce the friction here, and I would encourage the OP to also write about the steps involved...as it is, just calling it &quot;obtuse&quot; doesn&#x27;t really generate much sympathy.<p>There was a great NYT article about &quot;The Cellblocks&#x27; Amazon.com&quot;...a startup that navigated the bureaucratic roadblocks of sending gift packages to prisoners...this is what I thought the OP was trying at: <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/03/nyregion/sendapackage-bills-itself-as-new-yorks-inmate-superstore.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/03/nyregion/sendapackage-bill...</a><p>edit: My comment is more harsh than I&#x27;m probably feeling... I have no opinion of Mr. Benthall currently, I&#x27;m just pointing out that the site&#x27;s vagueness doesn&#x27;t really do him favors. If he&#x27;s being harshly punished by an overreaching justice system, more details/transparency about it is better for generating sympathy. And again, kudos to the OP for trying to navigate the prison-communication system... a writeup of what that involves would also generate some goodwill toward Mr. Benthall (as well as expanding awareness of our justice system in general)",1415722977

8590552,comment,8585483,8589250,0,0,lobster_johnson,,,"Seriously? I mean, Erlang has some gnarly syntax, but this is really basic, and translates directly to anything you&#x27;ll find in JavaScript, Go, Ruby, Scala, C++, even Java.<p>Let me take you through it:<p><pre><code>    do_stuff() ->\n</code></pre>\nThis declares a function do_stuff(). It&#x27;s exactly like:<p><pre><code>    function do_stuff() { ... }\n</code></pre>\nEverything after is the body. Unlike many languages, Erlang uses comma, not semicolons, as statement separators, function bodies end with a &quot;.&quot; so a function follows the form:<p><pre><code>    do_stuff() -> a, b, c.\n</code></pre>\nHere, a, b and c are statements. The last statement provides the return value. This directly translates to:<p><pre><code>    function do_stuff() { a; b; return c; }\n</code></pre>\nNext line defines a variable:<p><pre><code>    GetAnswer = fun() -> 42 end,\n</code></pre>\nThis just defines a variable which is an anonymous, inline function, sometimes called a closure or a lambda (all three are technically correct). In Erlang, anonymous functions end with &quot;end&quot;, not &quot;.&quot;. This is equivalent to JavaScript:<p><pre><code>    var GetAnswer = function() { return 42; };\n</code></pre>\nThe next line is therefore easy to understand, as it uses the same inline function syntax; it calls spawn() with this function as an argument. So it&#x27;s this:<p><pre><code>    spawn(...)\n</code></pre>\nThe argument is this function:<p><pre><code>    fun() -> io:format(&quot;The answer is ~p\n&quot;, [GetAnswer()]) end\n</code></pre>\nJavaScript version:<p><pre><code>    function() { return io.format(\n      &quot;The answer is ~p\n&quot;, [GetAnswer()]); }\n</code></pre>\n(Of course, JS doesn&#x27;t have spawn() or io.format(); this is just syntax.)<p>Complete version:<p><pre><code>    function do_stuff() {\n      var GetAnswer = function() { return 42; };     \n      spawn(function() {\n        io.format(&quot;The answer is ~p\n&quot;, [GetAnswer()]); });\n    }\n</code></pre>\nIn some ways, the JavaScript version is actually gnarlier. Look at all those braces and semicolons.<p>The thing is, the syntax we found nice is usually nice because it&#x27;s familiar. Many languages could seem like an incomprehensible mess if you&#x27;re used to C-style brace syntax. But that&#x27;s purely a question of familiarity. If you don&#x27;t know what all the bits and pieces mean, you&#x27;re going to be alienated by it. A developer who has grown up on COBOL and Forth will not find JavaScript syntax familiar any more than you find Erlang syntax familiar.<p>I suggest stepping out of your comfortable protective shell and trying it out. It&#x27;s not rocket science. After 30-60 minutes reading this book you&#x27;ll no longer find it alien, I bet:<p><a href=""http://learnyousomeerlang.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://learnyousomeerlang.com</a>",1415722481

I was commenting about &quot;This kernel function only gets 32 possible bitflags, but since they never validated their flags, they can no longer add any additional flags, ever, because it might break other programs which may or may not even exist.&quot;<p>That sort of mentality seems like it would push designers in the direction of poor design decisions.  If a bitflag is the best design for a new feature, but they&#x27;re prevented from using it out of a sense of &quot;Let&#x27;s not ever break anything ever,&quot; then the result may be a bad design that people are stuck with for the next 50+ years, which seems objectively worse.<p>But my reaction is based on theory and not backed by experience, so it&#x27;s probably unfounded.",1415721680

It&#x27;s a little overwhelming at times, how much interest and attention this project has garnered---especially so early into the 2nd draft, where I&#x27;m still shaping the breadth, depth, scope, and direction of the content.  The first time this project was posted to Hacker News earlier this year, I felt forced to push out exercises for the first two chapters as quickly as possible, just to give visitors some material to actually work with; but they do not yet reflect the final style and methodology that I&#x27;m aiming for.  I do want to make it clear, though, that I&#x27;m not going to stop working on this project until it meets the standards set down by Zed Shaw for LxTHW-based books.<p>The most important factor, as I understand it, is the show-don&#x27;t-tell method; it&#x27;s also the most difficult to achieve for a language like Common Lisp, which is so foreign to most people.  For the purposes of this draft-in-progress, however, just consider every explanation currently in the text as a placeholder for concrete examples that will illustrate the point better.<p>Another important factor is the pace of each exercise.  One of the biggest features I noticed about Zed Shaw&#x27;s Learn Code The Hard Way books is how perfectly he scaled the difficulty of progressive exercises, to maintain an even pace.  For an absolute beginner to programming, an exercise should take no more than an hour to complete---and that&#x27;s a goal I&#x27;m working towards for LLTHW as well.<p>To achieve these goals, once I finish laying out the content and direction with the intro text to each chapter, I&#x27;m going to be working backwards in each Part, writing progressively easier exercises, to make sure that all necessary material is covered, and that the pace is structured properly.  But even once the 2nd draft is complete, I will still be relying on user feedback to adjust the ordering and pace of the material, as needed.<p>Thanks for your feedback, and I hope you&#x27;ll continue participating in this project as I work out all the kinks!",1415721638

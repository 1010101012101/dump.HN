I'm pretty happy with it overall, and everything which I was really interested in is available.<p>Despite the massive amount of content available to me, I've found that I just watch the shows I'm interested in or a random movie and then go do something else.  I think the main reasons for that are that there's no show that just starts after the current one (I completely stopped watching Colbert) and there aren't re-runs of old shows that I liked.  In the case of the latter sometimes episodes of those shows are available, but I seem less inclined to watch them if I need to find and pick them then if I happen to see it's on some channel I'm passing by.",1260456951

We don't need to engage in meta-discussion about which blogs are worth reading because we simply upvote the specific posts that are worth reading. Prolific and consistently good writers simply appear more often.<p>If you, I or anybody else doesn't like what Joel writes or Jeff writes or Reg writes, the solution is definitely to write a blog post. But not this post. Instead, write the kind of blog post you want people to read. Be a force for positive change.<p>And if you don't feel like writing, don't get sucked into pointing fingers and sneering at others. Spend your time reading the good stuff.<p><i>Once there was a horse tied up on the side of the street. Whenever someone tried to pass, the horse would kick them. Soon a crowd gathered around the horse until a wise man was seen coming close. The people said “This horse will surely kill anyone who tries to pass. What are we going to do?” The wise man looked at the horse, turned and walked down another street. </i>",1260453978

That way, they can hire 2500 people who already know Cognos BI (which IBM owns) through education  and then send them out to companies to do consultation work.<p>It's a brilliant idea, and they'll make a LOT of money.",1260453862

I sometimes wonder if those who do not find this inherently bad can truly be sentient beings - but logic dictates that they are.

If one real URL scores much better than all others, you can redirect, otherwise provide a 404 with a choice of the top matches. I'm not sure automatically redirecting from incorrect URLs is within the HTTP spirit, however.",1260453723
987821,comment,987775,987794,0,0,pkrumins,,,"Sure.<p>I had a knowledge database back in 2002-2004. It was an application that I used every time I was learning something. It wasn't too advanced, I had to do everything manually, but now I am going to automate as much as I can.<p>Here is how it worked, every time I'd learn something from the web, I'd copy/paste the key information into the application from the source I was reading, add tags, wget the page (so that i had local copy of the database) and link to local copy. This was I was accumulating tons of information. Some days I'd review everything I had accumulated and add some comments with where it could be relevant. When I needed something, I'd just enter some phrase or keyword that I remembered, like 'linux security chmod' and I would locate the key facts about this topic that I had stored.<p>Now that I think of it, it can be argued that you can do the same with Google, but it would be a bit slower, you'd have to see which site was it and you'd sometimes make mistakes of locating the right one. But if it's in the database, there are just a few results and you can recall precisely which one is the right because you added the result. It's you personal knowledge database, not the knowledge database of the whole universe as Google is.",1260453709

Not only could I have gotten practically the same education at the local community college for much less, I may have avoided the 100+ student lecture classes my freshman and sophomore years. This was probably the most difficult adjustment for me when starting college (along with the lopsided gender ratio in engineering).<p>Unfortunately, as a senior at an expensive college-prep school, choosing community college would have been a huge blow to my ego. It also would have ashamed my parents, who are immigrants and place much emphasis on having the best (read: most prestigious) education possible for their children.",1260453615

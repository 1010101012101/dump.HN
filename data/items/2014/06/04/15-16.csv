Almost all of my data-center security and packet inspection devices have a Xeon or two in them.  The Cisco ASAs, Fireeye APT probes, Imperva WAFs, F5 load balancers, Sourcefire IDS.  A couple of them <i>also</i> have packet processing support hardware (Endace cards, mostly), but that&#x27;s mostly for taking the packet processing off the Xeons and letting them do just the inspection.

Since the soldiers pledge their loyalty to the crown it is deemed appropriate that a potential future monarch should serve in the military. They get to choose which bit, and perhaps when, but they probably never had a choice about joining up. Then the Royals only tend to spend a couple of years. Harry is the keenest as he joined infantry. But his fame brought him back from action early because he was a prized target.<p>Also Wikipedia now says Harry&#x27;s now in project management: &quot;On 17 January 2014, the Ministry of Defence announced that Harry had completed his attachment to 3 Regiment Army Air Corps and will take up a staff officer role at the position of SO3 (Defence Engagement) in HQ London District.

7846330,comment,7843618,7845195,4,0,revelation,,,"Checking the cell ID can be used to detect an IMSI catcher, but it requires knowing which cell IDs can be trusted. That requires some kind of cell ID whitelist and can be a pain to maintain / prone to false positives.<p>Notice however that CatcherCatcher does a lot more than just detecting IMSI catchers. It also detects when you receive a &quot;silent text message&quot;. Law enforcement works with mobile network operators to continously send these text messages to a mobile device. The baseband in the device then wakes, communicates with the nearest cell and thereby reveals its proximate location, without ever notifying the application processor that anything of note has happened. This allows for tracking a persons movement around cells at pretty much zero cost and can be done from any point in the world, unlike the IMSI catcher that requires you to be close to the target for it to pickup on the fake network.",1401897540

7846328,comment,7845565,7846231,1,0,x1798DE,,,"In true end-to-end encryption, this would probably not matter, since you can hand over all the encrypted e-mails you want and no one&#x27;s going to be reading them unless they have your private keys. That said, the nature of in-browser crypto is such that they (or anyone who controls their servers) could intermittently change the JS code they are serving in such a way that it captures your private keys and decrypt all your e-mails.<p>So it really depends on your threat model. This service is somewhat more secure than Lavabit, but incrementally and not by leaps and bounds. It also constrains the attack model (in the Lavabit model they could be coerced to give the plaintext directly, in this case they would need to be coerced to actively steal their users&#x27; private keys).",1401897516

As usual after a civil war, what emerged was not a democracy but a military dictatorship. The UK was a Protestant theocracy for a while. This was sufficiently awful that there was no substantial opposition to the return of the monarchy after the death of Cromwell; however 20 years later a combination of desire for parliamentary power and anti-Catholicism resulted in deposing the monarch and replacing him with a <i>different</i> monarch imported from Holland, who would be under the control of parliamentarians.<p>Unpicking the constitutional settlement opens several extremely controversial cans of worms. For example, the role of religion in the UK; authority over the armed forces; land ownership reform; the House of Lords; the electoral system in general; devolution; and the strangeness of the Crown dependencies (channel islands, Isle of Man, etc).<p>There <i>are</i> people who are violently loyal to the monarchy, as well as a wide spread of society who are affectionate towards the Royal Family.",1401897502

We&#x27;ve taken an energy and industrial system that absolutely cannot scale to seven billion people and now we&#x27;re trying to make it scale to seven billion people. The result is a kind of low-grade, very slow malthusian event in which people in the developed world are (relatively speaking) impoverished by exploding energy and resource costs. What we need is vertical development -- technological development -- to create systems that actually <i>will</i> scale. Everybody can&#x27;t drive a hydrocarbon powered car. It can&#x27;t be done.<p>I think this also explains why first world poverty rates are not shrinking. The poorer you are the more price sensitive you are to things like energy prices, so the poor are impacted by scarcity exponentially more than the wealthy.<p>Note that if this is true then wealth redistribution might not help. It might just trigger price inflation in scarce resources. Redistribute more and they&#x27;ll inflate more, and more, and more. ... But then again maybe it would help by causing lots of investment money to chase that demand and develop alternatives. It would cause hockey stick price signals across all the rate limiting inputs for the economy.<p>Hmm... well now... maybe we <i>should</i> drop money from helicopters...",1401897270

Seperate work and personal - There is no need to be receiving emails from friends, Amazon or whoever when you&#x27;re at work. Have a separate Inbox to process these, they will be waiting for you when you chose to look at them, not to distract you when replying to work emails.<p>2. Unsubscribe from everything - When was the last time you looked at or read a promotional email or weekly newsletter? If it wasn&#x27;t recently (a month), then unsubscribe.<p>3. Manage your contacts - Do you need to be CC&#x27;d into every email? If you don&#x27;t want to receive so many emails from a colleague, just email politely and say, due to the amount of emails you get, please don&#x27;t CC me unless it&#x27;s vitally important. This may have the added benefit of drawing their attention to what they&#x27;re doing and make them reconsider who else they&#x27;re CC&#x27;ing.<p>4. Consider separate email accounts for separate purposes - Running a businesses, a non-profit (as per OP) and you attend conferences alot? Why not have four email accounts? That way you can separate each of your 2 &#x27;jobs&#x27; and have one email for your personal friends and family, The Queen and Amazon. A separate &#x27;public profile&#x27; account can be used to field incoming requests for help or advice or meet-ups from strangers or acquaintances that you may meet at Conferences or on your blog. These are unlikely to be high-priority but you can have a scan through at your leisure when you get the time without them interrupting your normal work flow.<p>However, I can&#x27;t help but feel sometimes, people who receive thousands of emails it&#x27;s because they actually like to receive thousands of emails because it makes them feel and look more important and popular than they perhaps are. How many of those email chains were actually started by you sending out emails to other people? Or inviting people to contact you on websites or conferences? We&#x27;ve all heard someone subtly boasting about coming back from holiday and having x hundred emails. All they&#x27;re really saying is &quot;look how popular I am and how much people need me&quot;.

I have had many private conversations with researchers who will candidly say that the long-term goal of their work is lifespan extension or cognitive enhancement. Yet, for the purposes of grant and paper-writing, you&#x27;d never write such a thing; it would sound too speculative.<p>I think it was <i>Scientific American</i> or another such magazine that ran a story, maybe a month and a half ago, in which they interviewed a whole bunch of <i>real</i> theoretical and computational neuroscientists about mind uploading.  A not-that-small portion of these admitted that when they are in private, have had a drink or two, and are ready to admit things they would never say in a grant application, they are definitely trying to achieve whole-brain emulation.<p>Hell, it&#x27;s basically the implicit point of the Human Brain Project, or whatever those initiatives are called by the US and EU governments this past year.<p>> You are right that you won&#x27;t see many researchers publicly talking about human-level AI, or framing their research in terms of the search for general AI. But that doesn&#x27;t mean the field is &quot;dead&quot;.<p>Indeed.  What instead happened is that actual humanlike cognition has been steadily broken down into subproblems and each subproblem is being formalized and worked-on separately.  There are a few papers on optimal utility-maximizing agents for general environments, but those tend to require &quot;until the stars burn out&quot; levels of FLOPs to work anyway.<p>So actually, AI is going to work, but by the time it does, it won&#x27;t be called AI.  In fact, the researchers who&#x27;ll create it would look at you funny for calling it AI.  They do and will have lots of academic jargon used for specifying <i>exactly</i> what their algorithms do and how they do it, so much so that only when their algorithm kills all humans will anyone actually admit it was artificial intelligence ;-).",1401894877

I&#x27;ll reduce it to a smaller example case for simplicity.  The world has exactly 3 people in it.  Between the 3 of them, they can do exactly as much as 3 people can possibly do.  However, left to their own devices, their efforts are not coordinated.  They sometimes duplicate their efforts, and sometimes interfere with one another.  You can imagine them as n-dimensional vectors pointing away from a common point.<p>The sum of their magnitudes defines the sphere of human influence.  If they all voluntarily pointed in the same direction, they could reach a point on this sphere.  If that cooperative vector is projected onto each of their natural vectors, its magnitude could be greater than their own, working independently.  (It could also be less.)  Those people for whom it would be greater can realize an advantage by cooperation.<p>So these 3 form a civilization.  They decide that they will allow the others to constrain the direction of their natural effort vectors, so they are not coincident with their goal vectors.  Note that prior to the agreement, they could point in any direction they pleased.  They voluntarily limit their own freedoms for mutual advantage.  They establish rules that still allow some leeway in choosing direction, but encourage  a direction that still yields cooperative benefits.  These rules run the gamut from laws governing capital crimes to the dinner table etiquette for eating escargots.<p>So far, so good.  We have reduced human society to 3 arrows in space, and their sum vector.  Take a moment to bask in the nerdliness before we continue.<p>Now let us imagine that the vectors of two participants are more closely aligned to each other than with the third.  These two decide to form a company.  The rules of the company provide additional rules that encourage different vectors from those of larger cooperatives.  The two participants change their vectors accordingly, and suddenly the sum of all three effort vectors projects longer magnitudes on their goal vectors and a shorter magnitude onto the third person&#x27;s goal.<p>The company has a smaller sphere of influence than the civilization, having radius equal to the magnitude of only two effort vectors rather than three.  But the closer alignment of goals allows more efficient cooperative rules.<p>Being separate influences, the company rules could provide enough of a benefit that company participants could decide to break civil rules.  In this instance, anyone participating in the civil agreement but not the company agreement would be able to correctly say that the company is incompatible with the civilization, and the civil rules should be amended to compensate.  Perhaps it would institute a rule for corporations, to establish a mechanism for creating companies that do not undermine the civilization&#x27;s rules.<p>Now, the two people in the company could decide to continue only under their company rules.  But in that case, they should not expect that third person to continue under the civil rules.  That third person may, in fact, have to conter-compensate his effort vector to achieve a longer projection of the sum-of-efforts vector on his goal vector.<p>By this model, any company that does not include in its ruleset all the same rules as the civilization should not expect to benefit from those rules.<p>The conceit that a corporation is legally equivalent to a natural person in the purview of the government is limited by the fact that the government is the only entity that sees it as a person.  You have to choose to wear special glasses to see it that way.  Everyone else sees it as a legal fiction, and only plays along insofar as the arrangement benefits them--that is, as long as the corporation acts in the public interest.<p>The facts remain that corporations are creations of the government, and the government should not be able to create anything with powers that it does not itself possess.  Should people wish to cooperate using an entity with additional powers, they must do so directly, without the assistance of their intentionally-limited-in-powers government.  In that case, they will be unable to realize any advantages from the massive cooperative benefits the government may access.  While the private partnership can do no less than its partners, it can also do no more.  Tapping into more cooperative benefits requires adhering to stricter cooperative rules.",1401894749

I&#x27;ve always felt that database indexes are one of those fringe topics that&#x27;s just esoteric enough that people acquire a basic knowledge of them and know they need them, yet understanding indexes and using them correctly leads amazing performance.<p>On clustered indexes in particular, I try to follow these principles:<p>Narrow - in terms of a data type&#x27;s byte length, so that more keys can be packed into each level of the B-tree.  You can end up having to traverse fewer intermediate levels to reach the leaf level, where the data resides.<p>Unique - This ties into the point above, there will be no need to add a &quot;uniquifier&quot; to the key, helping to save space and the overhead of managing that extra tid-bit of data<p>Static - ideally, never changing.  By it&#x27;s nature, a clustered index is ordered, and updating/changing the keys will lead to data that&#x27;s in the wrong place.  You can kind of get around this by rebuilding the index after every update, but that just adds another task you&#x27;ll need to manage more often.<p>Increasing - this can lead to faster inserts; in a sense, the DB is just filling up the last page of the index and then adding another when it needs to.  (I think after a certain amount of inserts, eventually you&#x27;ll have to re-build the index (to add more intermediate level nodes) but I can&#x27;t recall the specifics, and you&#x27;re going to have to do rebuild indexes anyway with all indexing strategies.)",1401894614

7845959,comment,7845361,7845733,1,0,scrumper,,,"> Surely we should abolish such a job...<p>Fun to think about!<p>Let&#x27;s say we decide to abolish the monarchy purely on humanitarian grounds (i.e. it&#x27;s tantamount to slavery, however gilded the shackles might be, so let&#x27;s rescue them). Do they get a say? What if they decline to be saved? What does that say about their motivations - maybe they like the rewards of their servitude a little too much? What if secretly they crave power? Does the very act of refusing to be freed imply that they <i>must</i> be freed? What about the converse - if they accept release, then perhaps we&#x27;d consider them to be truly moral and therefore ideally suited to the role; mightn&#x27;t we then decide not to abolish the job after all?<p>My personal view is that the monarchy is a net benefit to the country, both economically and politically. I believe that republicanism* in Britain is mostly the product of reflexive prejudice and not deep, open minded consideration. I&#x27;d be interested to hear what the proposed benefits of abolishing the monarchy are, beyond a trivial cash saving which one might argue is invalid in the first place.<p>*(meaning abolition of the monarchy, not the Irish variety)",1401894441

During the &#x27;70s and &#x27;80s heyday of AI, the focus was on mechanisms that would mimic high-level aspects of human cognition: A* search, Prolog, and so on. The overall approach at the time was top-down, and focusing on deterministic algorithms.<p>I think what we have learned in the interim is not just that &quot;machine-learning&quot; style approaches are successful at specific tasks, but also that a statistical, data-driven, &quot;bottom-up&quot; approach is going to need to be an integral part of any eventual general AI solution. Whether we will need to explicitly design the high-level cognitive elements, or whether they will emerge from properly constructed low-level elements, remains an open question.<p>Another very important advance since the 70s/80s is the widespread realization that every major aspect of cognition is essentially probabilistic. People have realized that a search for &quot;exact&quot; or &quot;optimal&quot; solutions to problems with the complexity seen in the real world is a futile task because of the high dimensionality of these problems.",1401894138

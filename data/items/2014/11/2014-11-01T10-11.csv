By way of contrast, my best finish was a little worse than 100th, when I was 14.<p>Ran was 3 years ahead of me, and pretty much the ideal roommate (my second semester; I invited him to swap rooms with a first semester roommate I didn&#x27;t much get along with). No hassles about living conditions; some older-friend general advice; a lot of help studying for my qualifying exams.<p>Ran had a sadness about him due to political controversy -- he had gotten a special postponement of army duty due to his precociousness, he didn&#x27;t want to go back to fulfil his commitment, and orthodox Jewish department chair Shlomo Sternberg pretty much expelled him (albeit with a PhD) in retaliation.<p>Of course, a much greater sadness later occurred in Ran&#x27;s life, as his ex-wife killed their child in a murder-suicide. :(<p>Ofer was a stereotypical geek; Ran was a more socially adept guy, with girlfriends and so on. Not coincidentally, he spoke the much better English of the two.<p>If we had a hierarchy of who was quickest and smartest in the department, the top two were generally thought of as Ofer and Angelos Tsiromokos. In reality, Don Coppersmith was right up there as well. Angelos of course is the one who never got his PhD, instead going off to be a translator for the Common Market/EU. But then, he could beat me at Scrabble, despite English being his third language.<p>(On the other hand, Daniel Pipes, who briefly lived in my dorm, didn&#x27;t take kindly when a math guy -- me -- took him down at a word game. :) )<p>Ran told me of a multi-day conversation in which guys progressed through the natural numbers, coming up with an interesting mathematical question to which the number was the answer. I think they got stuck at 93 or so.<p>When we were in the common room, it somehow came up in conversation that Jacobi was Jewish.

C4 does not use transactional memory, it does however employ a very elegant lock-free algorithm which allows continuous concurrent compacting collections. BTW that is why it is called C4.<p>I can tell you from first hand experience that is does not have throughput issues. The truth is quite the opposite as it is the only JVM I&#x27;ve found scales well on large core count or large memory systems.<p>Do you have experimental evidence to back up your claims or are they just conjecture?<p>Having studied C4 it is important to note that to get the best out of it you need to allow it to avail of a large heap. If your mindset is to keep the heap small, as you would with many other collectors, then you will be restricting the C4 collecting algorithm from performing at its best. Don&#x27;t be shy, give it a big heap to play with. The obvious consequence to this is that C4 is not ideal for constrained memory systems - but that is not the world the majority of our servers live in today.<p>Amendment: All the above applies to Zing (C4) on Intel x86_64.",1414838209

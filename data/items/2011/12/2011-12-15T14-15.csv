There are far more ways that a private entity can support a politician than through money or even in-kind support.

Chrome replaced Firefox for many and, while lightweight and fast in it's early days, it has too become bloated; they are even working on a terminal emulator[0].<p>I'm also seeing a rise of distrust towards Google, as they are growing in size. Google is the new Microsoft but it's still 'cool' in the tech world. We must not forget that Google's business is that of serving advertisement, all their products are geared towards this. Yet they also improve the web by pushing open standards (Although the HTML5 player on YouTube, e.g., is inferior to the Flash player).<p>While Chrome never was very configurable (How does one change the shortcut for opening a new tab) Google really cut in this area. Without an extension you can't even change the New Tab page, and their recent revamp of it certainly isn't popular with everybody.<p>Now I ask you, HN, do you think it's time for a new browser?

Please use a custom theme for the jquery-ui widgets (like the autocomplete). It's like default and it doesn't match the page<p>3. I don't think blocking the search button is a good idea, if the autocomplete goes slow or the user is fast it will create the illusion of a broken button.<p>4. Give the search button a little bit of button style<p>5. I don't like the sign on facebook popup that gets on the way of the search, maybe putting it on the results page would be less anoying making users click on sign in only when they have tried and liked the application.<p>6. If you don't like 5), at least put the 'No thanks, show me generic results' on a button, something green or so, like the search button<p>7. Fix the 'Sorry! No items match this filter.' message, it's only text, you can do better using some cute images and inviting the user to re-search or change tabs.<p>That is about it, looks nice.",1323960359

And they're not too keen on the sovereignty of the individual: their right to decide their own values, and act as they deem best to maximize their own values.<p>The way our current system, with a single ""left/right"" dimension, divides up support for these seems to demand that we all take a position on which grouping -- column A or column B -- are more important, and that's very unfortunate.

Housewives, pensioners, working people who want to use a browser but don't have much time to invest in learning its intricacies.<p>History has shown that people can live with screwed up technology for a long time without looking for improvements because they think it's normal or they're used to it (floppy disks for file transfer in the 21st century, for instance) and sometimes new technology or features have to be forced upon the user for them to take it up.
In the case of Chrome, regular people get a truncated version of what a browser can do (no significant difference in features from Internet Explorer except speed). This creates a large entry barrier for regular people.<p>Do you think your average grandpa using Chrome (or Firefox, for that matter) will have a revelation at some point, thinking ""gee, I'd really like to have mouse gestures, they would make my life so much easier for my poor hands""? Or ""wow, I'd sure like a speed dial whenever I open my browser so that I can go with one click to the pages I most often use"" (no, I don't want ""most visited"" as chosen by Chrome, I want speed dial). No, of course it's not going to happen; grandpa has never heard of RSS, mouse gestures, speed dial, and so on; someone (or something) has to explicitly tell/show him these features so that he becomes aware that they are possible.<p>I also have a personal beef with the people who thought that on startup Chrome should have ""open the home page"" as default option instead of ""reopen the pages that were open last"". This is the most retarded default option I could think of in our day and age - if someone wants to get rid of their tabs then they will CLOSE THEM. It's that simple. Just because I have to close the browser does not mean that I finished what I was doing and that I want my tabs closed. Opera got this right more than 10 years ago but some people still have the Internet Explorer 6 mindset. It's as if all your Gmail messages were marked unread when you logged in to your inbox because hey, it's a new session.<p>TL/DR - extensions are a poor substitute for built-in functionality in a world where the majority of users still are regular users (non-tech savvy).

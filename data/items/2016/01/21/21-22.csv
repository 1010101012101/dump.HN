10948772,comment,10940455,10947634,0,0,Nrsolis,,,"What makes you think that taxes aren&#x27;t already being paid in the foreign jurisdictions?<p>This is a big part of the disconnect: if you (say, as Apple) sell a phone in Munich, you&#x27;re paying the VAT tax in that country already.<p>Generally speaking, when you take the profits from your German sales back to the USA, in many (most, save a few exception) cases, you&#x27;re going to pay corporate taxes on those profits now that they are repatriated back in the USA.  So companies are incentivized to keep those profits in overseas jurisdictions to defer the US tax and reinvest in their overseas operations.  Considering how much of their actual sales come from overseas, it&#x27;s no wonder that they pursue this strategy.<p>EVEN IF a company wanted to be a &quot;good US corporate citizen&quot; and pay more taxes to the government, they&#x27;d be at a financial disadvantage to overseas companies doing business in the USA because THOSE companies DON&#x27;T have to pay tax on their overseas profits.  That&#x27;s why you see all of these companies set up in &quot;corporate tax havens&quot; that don&#x27;t tax a single penny of offshore income.  For one thing: it&#x27;s damn easy to do international business through these companies because you effectively have a neutral ground from the perspective of finance.  For another: you save money on taxes, allowing you to offer better terms to your customers and partners.<p>This kind of stuff only matters to the biggest corporations with multinational operations because the regulatory minefield associated with keeping track of laws and regs in lots of different countries is a nightmare and only a few top accounting firms have the talent to master it.  Another reason why the law of unintended consequences shifts the tax burden to the little guy: he&#x27;s not big enough to care about shifting his income overseas.  When you create incentives by way of regulatory/tax arbitrage, you make it worth the while of a big multinational to invest the time and effort structure their deals so they take place in offshore jurisdictions.",1453413563

Author thinks good: <i>If corporate leaders and their investors truly believed that the future were bleak, that innovation and economic growth were irreparably slowing, there would be little reason to hold on to all that cash.</i> AKA that we are on the cusp of a new wave of innovation.<p>Personally I don&#x27;t believe this matches up with leading business cycle indicators, such as the stock market, employment rates, and trends federal spending as a percentage of GDP.

Everyone was buying shit non-stop. What kind of life is that? Sure it created jobs and growth but to the ludicrous end where we refused to accept the gravy train was ending. I remember Bush 43 pleading for Americans to &quot;go back shopping&quot; the black friday after 9/11 when the writing was finally on the wall. Its perverse.<p>I think if we want a shorter work-week, more holidays, and more leisure then we have to concede a bit on demand/buying shit. The endless race for growth eventually hits the laws of diminishing returns hard. Worst of all, automation is here in significant ways now. A lot of jobs are going to be gone forever with very limited new growth to make up for it. If I&#x27;m automating the responsibilities of hundreds of employees, I just don&#x27;t see what can make up for it.

10948741,comment,10947192,10948403,0,0,pcwalton,,,"Well, since you mentioned performance, the stuff I mentioned also buys you performance. Rust is in a category of language performance that GC&#x27;d languages with runtimes or JITs never reach in practice. I don&#x27;t believe Go will be an exception to this (especially not now, with its lack of an optimizing compiler).<p>In general, I think if you&#x27;re looking for &quot;one language to rule them all&quot;, that can scale up to the highest performance and down to one-off apps you would write in Rails, you will be disappointed. Even if you don&#x27;t care about safety. That&#x27;s because, no matter what people say, static and dynamic typing <i>is</i> a tradeoff. Rust is more statically typed than Go is. Go is more statically typed than Ruby is. Which you should use depends on your circumstances.<p>A lot of language designers and enthusiasts, from all communities, believe there&#x27;s a &quot;sweet spot&quot; of language design where your language can scale up or down at will. I don&#x27;t believe it. That experiment was tried with Lisp and Java and failed. Multiple languages are here to stay.<p>At the end of the day, all I can say is: If you&#x27;re happy with Go, use Go. Rust was never designed with all use cases in mind, and I don&#x27;t see that fact as a failure at all. I see it as just acknowledging reality: trying to make a language that scales up and down indefinitely to all use cases is chasing the impossible, and language enthusiasts who believe their language is the one language that can do that are all mistaken.",1453413415

10948708,comment,10946177,10948577,0,0,jcrites,,,"These are the kinds of questions I&#x27;d be concerned with:<p>Can I easily develop Haskell from any platform (Windows, Mac, Linux) and are good IDEs available on all of them? My team is diverse and I don&#x27;t want to tell my engineers what platform they have to use for development. Can I meaningfully develop my server software on those platforms and deploy it to another OS (Linux)?<p>I agree that Haskell&#x27;s type system will catch problems made in refactoring, but it&#x27;s about avoiding the <i>effort</i>. If I wish to rename a method or a class, I don&#x27;t want to spend time updating the text manually everywhere that is relevant and working through compiler errors - I just want to say &quot;rename class&quot;, &quot;rename method&quot;. In large code bases this prohibits people from improving the code over time and doing maintenance work.<p>Are there Haskell IDEs of equivalent quality to Eclipse and IntelliJ? My software development is a lot slower if I need to remember the standard library precisely and type its methods and classes, rather than typing TPE and allowing the IDE to auto-complete it to ThreadPoolExecutor; and it&#x27;s a lot slower if I can&#x27;t highlight a method and quickly invoke the IDE command for &quot;show me all methods that call this method&quot;, or &quot;show me the implementation of this class / method&quot;. I&#x27;ve personally found that this kind of code authoring and navigation assistance has a dominant impact on practical development speed.<p>When I&#x27;ve written a unit test, can I easily select the test in my IDE and run that single test with a keystroke, attaching a debugger if needed? (Maybe Haskell needs fewer unit tests, but for business software I doubt it.) That same test suite will be run by my build system at build time to make sure everything passes.<p>How would I accomplish in Haskell the equivalent of what Metrics helps you solve in Java? <a href=""https://dropwizard.github.io/metrics/3.1.0/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://dropwizard.github.io/metrics/3.1.0/</a> Or Log4j and Slf4j? Managing log messages from large applications is important, since log messages are the primary after-the-fact record of what processing took place. They&#x27;re often all you have to go on, aside from any metrics you&#x27;ve produced. (I would not buy the idea that Haskell code is <i>so</i> defect-free that these kinds of tools are unnecessary. In any case, Metrics is about performance metrics and business-relevant metrics.)<p>Are there profiling tools comparable to JProfiler? Can I easily get stack traces and heap dumps at runtime? In Java there are great interactive tools to explore these, to inspect every object and its properties and GC state. If the application crashes (not the runtime), is good troubleshooting information available to figure out what went wrong? It&#x27;s more difficult, though still possible, to attach debuggers to production code and step through, so log messages are a poor man&#x27;s after-the-fact trace. That said, I can still attach a debugger to a JVM remotely over the network and inspect the threads, heap, etc., and step through code execution. Is it easy to debug (attach a debugger to) a Haskell program as-is over the network in production?<p>How would I write a distributed map/reduce job with Haskell and execute it across a large fleet, like I would with Java using Hadoop, Spark? Are there distributed actor frameworks with the quality of Akka, or messaging systems like Kafka? Are there good RPC libraries for Haskell to interact with other applications written in Apache Avro, Google Protocol Buffers, Cap&#x27;n Proto, and so on? The tools I mention are <i>solid</i>, and very widely deployed - they&#x27;re not obscure.<p>There are a lot of practical large-scale problems that I can solve easily in Java, ones where many other programmers would be familiar with the solution I&#x27;d use. If there are good ways to solve these problems then I&#x27;d love to learn more. I&#x27;ve always been a fan of the Haskell language and its concepts, as well as F# and Scala. However, despite my wish to use them, I&#x27;ve run into a lot of practical challenges. These extra-linguistic factors involved in running software in production dominate the linguistic ones.",1453413250

Except that the only reason advertisers <i>need</i> to fingerprint the user is in order to collect enough information to decide which ads to serve to them, which is precisely what they&#x27;d be getting from Brave (and then some.)  Great, that information is stored in the browser instead of the cloud, and only subsets of it are exposed to the advertisers for each request -- but that doesn&#x27;t benefit the end user at all. It benefits Brave, by maintaining their middleman position as the de facto controller of which advertisers gets access to that data.<p>&quot;We block trackers, that’s a big win compared to the status quo.&quot; It is!

How long do you expect nuclear to be human&#x27;s primary fuel source, and how do you plan to deal with non-technical challenges.<p>Modern technical society is about 200-250 years old -- most sources date the start of the Industrial Revolution to about 1800.  Virtually all our present institutions, companies, science and understand, etc., have emerged or substantially evolved during this time (though of course many trace back further).<p>Running nuclear power at global scale from here until Doomsday means planning at the level of centuries, if not millennia or even millions of years.  That&#x27;s timescales exceeding the oldest people, companies, governments, schools, religions, languages, even basic systems of morality and ethics.<p>Provisioning global-scale nuclear power would require on the order of 15,000 plants operating simultaneously. Unavoidable metal embrittlement limits these to a practical life of about 40 years. That means commissioning and decommissioning plants at the rate of one per day, and both processes are themselves 20-40 year endeavours.<p>That occurring through political and economic crises, wars, natural disasters, political and moral revolutions, and more.

Substantial fault in <i>all</i> accident cases devolves to human and management practices, again, exceptionaly difficult to engineer around.  With 30 times that many reactors operating from now until Doomsday, what acceptible accident rate are you targeting?  We&#x27;re at about 1:50 reactor years.  Are you going to bump that up 10 - 100 fold?<p>At 1 per 100 reactor-years, we&#x27;re looking at 150 core meltdowns pere century. At 1:1000, 15.

Forever.<p>Renewable energy systems based on solar, wind, geothermal, and hydroelectric sources have far more benign failure rates.

China&#x27;s Banqiao Dam failed in 1975 (itself a story of engineering, design, management, communications, and meterological factors) killing 171,000.  <i>Despite that, the region is now home to over 7 million people.</i> The <i>long term</i> effects of such failures is relatively minimal, compared to the nondiscretionary multi-century wildlife refuges now surrounding the former Chernobyl and Fukushima sites, as well as smaller-factor radiation problems at locations such as Hanford, Washington.<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banqiao_Dam"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banqiao_Dam</a><p>More generally, the problem I see is that which was the real core message of the 1972 book <i>Limits to Growth</i>.

Those limits need to be embraced.<p>Nuclear power is just one of numerous cases of pleading for exceptions from the Gods of Complexity.

The .NET ecosystem is pretty high up there for performance (and gives you a bit more room for fine tuning) and it easily has some of the best support in the industry (both 1st and 3rd party).

Back in 2008 the $70 was all anyone could talk about. That despite the fact that included funding for benefits the Japanese automakers didn&#x27;t provide because they were socialized. Also completely ignoring that total labor cost was around 10%. Just how much did people think it could be cut?<p>Cut compensation and benefits in half and you save a whopping $1,500 on that $30,000 car. You know, the domestic one that&#x27;s <i>already</i> cheaper that you weren&#x27;t considering in the first place.<p>So would I tolerate my grocery bill being 2% higher to give cashiers/stockers/etc a living wage? Absolutely. I pay a lot more than that just to avoid shopping at Walmart in the first place (the parking lot is always packed, the lines are long, the aisles a mess and it&#x27;s further away than Fiesta, the asian market, Albertson&#x27;s, Kroger&#x27;s or Target).<p>What if the receipt was 10% higher? If it provided a living wage, decent benefits, and improved their stores generally then yeah, I probably would. The spread between the asian market and Target is already much much higher than that.<p>More than that? Not unless they excelled in some area. For packaged meats Target does a real decent job. For produce the asian market is where it&#x27;s at. For bulk items at low prices Fiesta rules. The others are sort of middle-of-the-road in offerings, at decent, if not amazing prices.<p>But I seriously doubt anything like or above 10% would be close to necessary to achieve what was proposed.",1453411485

There are millions of SSID called &quot;Netgear&quot; for example. You can&#x27;t use the name as a unique value, so mac addresses it is.<p>Regardless, phones are smart enough to understand that GPS is authoratitive, AGPS second, and wifi/IP address as last. If GPS/AGPS says Chicago, but the wifi says Atlanta, the phone should consider Chicago authoritative. I also believe its not the access point youre near, but a relationship of access points nearby that gives you a location. So if you see three mac addresses, all three are looked up to do a lookup and act as a sanity check against people recently moving and taking their wifi router with them.<p>I imagine the real reason will be something more prosaic than some GPS shattering bug. Neighbors running a criminal ring perhaps, duplicate mac address, random idiots messing with these poor people, some bug in a popular &#x27;find my phone&#x27; app, a geoIP bug, a local craigslist scammer using their address for whatever reason, etc.<p>Sadly, the article doesn&#x27;t specify what service is being used to track the phones or really any technical details, so its difficult to really say whats going on here.

I wish every editor had these.<p>4) Handwriting is well supported.<p>Bad stuff:<p>1) The organizational structure is overly complex and confusing as it has three categories of structure: Notebooks (top pulldown), Sections (tabs on top), and Pages (tabs on right). This makes it hard to know which to use and it&#x27;s visually overwhelming.<p>Wikipedia is a good example of something better as its structure is much more uniform: everything is a page and all navigation uses links.<p>2) Synchronizing is very slow compared to google docs. This makes it fine for simple scenarios where people edit alone and share after it&#x27;s mostly written, but makes it hard to work together on a document (no multiple cursors on the page)<p>My guess is (1) and (2) are an artifact of Notebooks being files instead of &quot;in the cloud&quot;. This likely forces the organizational structure OneNote has, and slows down synchronizing because it&#x27;s harder to sync at the file level rather than the text-run level.<p>3) Shared freeform content like this gets out of date fast. This should be built into the product so we can see which pages are important to the organization. Most people don&#x27;t delete pages ever, so some way of showing which pages matter and which should be disregarded would be very helpful.",1453411356

There were occasional recessions, but that wasn&#x27;t a permanent condition. That&#x27;s over in the US. Plenty of land outside NY and SF, lots of workers (some might need retraining, but it&#x27;s not like the real labor shortage of WWII), oceans of capital, and lots of experienced managers.

You can connect to the JVM and examine what objects are in the heap, or request a thread dump and see what threads the application has launched and what they&#x27;re doing. There are rarely any (JVM-level) correctness issues since code is safe and has a simple exception model - JVMs are rock solid and virtually never crash. There are advanced profiling tools available, and simple ones built in. It&#x27;s easy to deploy applications due to Java&#x27;s jar and class model. You can inspect a class and see its code as-deployed. Building Java code is simple, so there are rarely any build tooling or reproducibility issues.<p>Java also has excellent tools for logging and metrics emission, like Log4j / Slf4j and utilities like Metrics. These are just a few of the system-level features that are critical in large-scale deployments, and in practice these elements matter quite a lot for managing production apps. The language itself is only part of the story.<p>The Java language has also been improving substantially. Java 1.8 launched a lot of great features, like lambdas, functional interfaces, streams, and other modern elements that give me most of what I expect from a modern language and allow me to write clear and concise code that is statically typed, in the context of really strong IDEs. Java&#x27;s portability makes it straightforward to develop an application from any platform (not just the server platform you deploy on).<p>IDE support is crucial and frequently overlooked. Automatic code completion, refactoring, and inspection (&quot;show all usages of this method&quot;) are essential to working on large code bases together as a team. Java also has style enforcement and static analysis tools like FindBugs, Fortify, CheckStyle, etc. Java&#x27;s open source community is <i>extremely</i> strong - look at all of the work happening under the Apache umbrella such as Hadoop, Spark, and Hive [1] or Google&#x27;s umbrella, like Google Guava [2] or the Dataflow SDK [3]. There are excellent concurrency tools like java.util.concurrent, Guava&#x27;s futures, and Akka.<p>I agree with meddlepal on this one.

10948326,comment,10946177,10948056,0,0,edem,,,"On the contrary Scala is baroque, its syntax is not following any known pattern. For example if I want to write a recursive function I have to indicate my return parameter type otherwise not. It doesn&#x27;t matter whether you come from a C background or a Java background...or any background because of this:<p>>   def addInt( a:Int, b:Int ) : Int = {<p>>      var sum:Int = 0<p>>      sum = a + b<p>>      return sum<p>>   }<p>You have to relearn how a function looks like in the first place. Return types are at the end, parameter types are after the parameter name separated by a colon.<p>If you want a language which runs on the JVM Clojure is a way better option. You don&#x27;t have to learn its syntax since there is hardly anything you can call one. It is binary compatible with itself which is not true with Scala, you can choose whether you want a type system or not since it is optional (look at clojure/core.typed). It is also interoperable with java but it has a much better functional approach to programming compared to Scala since everything is immutable but it is not wasteful because of persistent data structures and for concurrency you have the STM which IMHO is a strict upgrade to the Actor model. Writing DSLs with the powerful macros Clojure has is more usable than any non-lisp language and the result is more expressive.<p>So to add it all up with Scala you add a lot of complexity and a lot of pitfalls you can fall into while with Clojure you take away complexity while retaining the vast Java ecosystem for interoperability.

So, at most you may want ~30% of one days worth of storage which less than ~1/20th of what he wants.  Extra capacity is actually fairly cheap (winds cost are ~2.5¢/kWh now) and something we already do.  In extreme events like a heat wave, traditional hydropower can make up the long term difference as it&#x27;s designed to store power over long periods already.<p>There math is also wrong on energy density, you get ~30% efficiency with gas > electricity.  So one gallon of gas takes less water on balance.  ~4 cubic meters of water dropping one mile ~= 1 gallon.  A 10 meter drop in water level over 1 km^2 = ~2,500,000 gallons of gas <i>per day</i> and 0.9 billion gallons of gas per year.<p>Sure, you would need two ~1 km^2 square body&#x27;s of water within ~3 miles of each other with one ~1 mile higher than another.  But, building two 10-20m deep pools is cheap, so now you just need a large flat hill or an unusually deep valley.<p>PS: People talk about how variable wind is, but if you ignore the peak and compare median power to minimal power it&#x27;s actually surprisingly steady.

14209,comment,14112,14112,0,0,dawie,,,"I think its possible to compete with Google on most things, except Web Search. Google has web search nailed down. I think this is the reason when people give advice to startups they nearly always say: Find a niche, or do one thing really well... Google does Web Search better tahn anyone else. Can it be done better, of course.\n",1176922780

14205,comment,14154,14154,0,0,theremora,,,"PG,   Since the piece was mostly tongue in cheek I agree, not much thought went into it.  But it would only make sense that some of the team members not making the cut ended up on a team that did.  Also, it is common knowledge and confirmed by large companies such as Google and Microsoft that they sometimes buy companies for the value of the team rather than the product. So in the general sense,  the logic works.<p>After reading some threads in your news-YC section, I did find that some of the companies not making the grade were ticked off. But, this can be handled by setting expectations and delivering the rejection in the proper manner. We all know that we desire what we cant have.\nPut it this way. I am sure that a recruiter that had access to the list of contacts amassed through your funding contests could show a fine ROI on your investment.  No doubt there is value in that network of contacts.<p>BTW the article is Titled:  Paul Graham is Selling our children   \n",1176922484

14202,comment,14093,14093,0,0,falsestprophet,,,"This is a little silly. How do you know when you have found a robot? When someone says no. How do you know when you have found an entrepreneur? When someone says yes. No doubt a good entrepreneur can find an encouraging angle on a lot of bad ideas, but that insight still does not make a bad idea good. <p>Innovative people have a lot of ideas; successful innovative people are able to understand which ideas are worthwhile and execute them. An entrepreneur with promise may well tell you: You are dead wrong.<p>Of course a buffoon may well tell you the same when you are well on your way to conquer the world. This article does not offer helpful insight into understanding who to respect (save for not respecting the author of course).",1176922244

But no, I have enough problems distracting myself from work, without blocking sites.<p>It comes down to the fact that, when I'm 'in the zone' I don't bother to read websites, and when I'm not, there's nothing that's going to take me there, so I might as well enjoy the internet.",1176921906
14198,comment,14183,14184,0,0,mattculbreth,,,"I'd suggest asking for 90% of a first-year salary for CS majors in the area (I'm guessing $55k or so?), plus 5% equity.  Take it from there.  You might get beat up on the 5% but if you're employee #1 it sounds reasonable.<p>Think hard though about leaving school.  Not saying it's a bad idea, just think it through.\n",1176921725

They gave me a demo of their product and I think it has a lot of potential.<p>Here's my situation: I'm a college student (sophomore), been writing websites in html since age 9, very comfortable with many open, web-based languages, and very skilled in graphic design and marketing.  I have most Adobe/Macromedia programs down.  I would also be the first 'employee' at this startup (would prefer a co-founder position, but I'm not sure if it's reasonable to negotiate on that level).<p>I've calculated it may cost me $2,000 a month to get a studio apartment.  Aside from that, I'll have to start paying my financial aid 6 months after leaving school.  Does anyone know what ballpark number I should be negotiating under?",1176920982

14176,comment,14154,14154,0,0,pg,,,"This guy has not thought things through.  Sure, hundreds of people apply to YC every cycle, but we only develop a relationship with the few we fund.  In fact the thing I like least of all about YC is that it's effectively a machine for making hundreds of smart hackers dislike us, or at least feel somewhat hurt, every six months.<p>Also, like nearly everyone (including, fortunately, most imitators) he's stuck on this idea that we like to fund undergrads.  In fact the median founder is around 25; it's harder to get funded as an undergrad than not.",1176920166

I had Reddit blocked at work for a while so I could finish up my previous project.<p>Alas, I find that taking away distractions really doesn't help that much.  I usually just find something else to distract myself.  I need to find something that's more engrossing than the distraction for this to work well.<p>Unfortunately, my workplace is interruption-central.  Open-plan office, cubemate working on the same project, frequent calls to help out on something.  Makes me feel important, but hard to get anything done.  Ah well, it's my employer's problem.

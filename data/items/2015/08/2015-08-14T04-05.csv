Otherwise I imagine that&#x27;s a really expensive bill.<p>Do you think they&#x27;re doing it because its cheaper when you account for things at a larger scale? Like, reduced liabilities, payrolls, CapEx, whatever? Or is it more expensive but still &quot;easier&quot; and they go with it?<p>I really REALLY would like to hear everything from everyone about this, because right now I&#x27;m facing that decision for my company. I&#x27;m not as big as Netflix obv, but it is a big deal for me. It is really attractive to have all the scale you need at will and forget about maintenance at all; even if it is more expensive I would gladly pay as much as double my operating costs if I can rest easily at night. I would even eat as much as 10%-20% of my profits if I don&#x27;t have to deal with that.<p>But the devil is in the details, I think is relatively easier to go full-cloud than to later find out it was a mistake and try to migrate back to your private premises. So, what could be the downsides of going full-cloud just as Netflix did? Also, taking into account that I&#x27;m not a personal friend of Bezos neither another Netflix, I would be just another smallish guy and I&#x27;m pretty sure that won&#x27;t get me all the perks that come with the former.",1439528399

The human brain isn&#x27;t always logical and can become emotional and irrational in some situations.<p>I live in Ferguson Missouri, we have riots and looting here. It is much more than the death of Mike Brown, it is government corruption, it is decades old racism, it is racial profiling by the police, it is politicians cutting the budget of education and the police to pay themselves more money, it is police officers using deadly force when if they had a taser it would have been different, it is lack of good paying jobs, it is a ruin down houses and condos and apartments, you got non-violent protesters and then you got some violent ones with them that throw rocks and bottles at police officers and even some shooting guns. I can&#x27;t think of a solution to all of that. But it is a bigger problem than workplace shooters.<p>In my case the society is sick, and it is only sick because of injustices and perceived wrongdoing by the police. You hear protesters saying they want to kill the police officers, because they have killed innocent black lives.<p>Again I don&#x27;t know of a solution to that, I&#x27;m trained to solve problems involving computers, math, science, and using logic and reason.<p>Racism does not pass intelligence tests, it is not logical or rational. It is based on hate, much the same as workplace shooters are based on hate and don&#x27;t follow logic and reason.<p>When a human being isn&#x27;t being logical or rational and goes with emotions like hate and fear, you&#x27;d almost have to get into abnormal psychology to find a solution.<p>Yes there might exist better answers.<p>As a mentally ill person, society generally looks down on me and does not support me anyway.

The problem they very well and knowingly created.. And they never speak up before this point.. It&#x27;s only after they&#x27;ve sucked every last drop out of the system..

And why does society fall for it every-time?<p>And I like how socialism is being promoted as a solution while the very same jokers who decimated American culture/free market capitalism are pumping in illegals by the boatloads. It&#x27;s as if they&#x27;re already prepping to tank/exploit the next system that gets paraded as a solution. Yeah, so there&#x27;s not enough jobs and the jobs there are don&#x27;t pay enough because we allow corporations and individuals to extort the crap out of everything a person needs. So, lets ignore all of that and have :<p>> Guaranteed income<p>> Free healthcare<p>And since there isn&#x27;t enough to go around in way of jobs, lets have :<p>> Open borders so people can overload the system<p>> Tons more legal immigrants<p>> Tons more illegal immigrants<p>And lets not focus at all on education so people can actually be productive... In fact, lets make it harder for the educated individuals by importing tons of competition from outside the country...Yeah, that&#x27;ll work out great<p>Who pays for all of this? Certainly not those who create/created this disaster. But yeah, socialism will fix things. After-all, it works in Europe where they have all of the things we don&#x27;t have :<p>> Far more strict immigration<p>> Far more Homogeneous culture and population<p>> Far less exploitative economic system<p>> Far more educated and involved populous<p>> Far less corrupt government<p>*Facepalm ..

For anyone who doesn&#x27;t see that this country is in sharp decline, I wonder.<p>Every time, America puts the foxes in charge of the hen house and then people wonder why it ends in disaster...<p>When you fix a bug, do you target the root or do you try to find the most inefficient and indirect way of fixing the code issue? If you have an unreliable code base (economic equality), do you initiate an unbridled code blitz among your worst software engineers (Unbounded illegal immigration)?<p>I feel like I&#x27;m in the twilight zone sometimes in this country...

10058670,comment,10058510,10058510,0,0,alialkhatib,,,"The title seems a little misleading. The study seems to explore the social impact of explicitly <i>declining to answer</i> questions, which is very different from <i>not volunteering</i> something. If I&#x27;m telling someone about my work history, the social implications of leaving out that summer I swept freight docks is different from telling them I&#x27;d rather not talk about the summer in question given that they&#x27;ve asked.<p>In the former case, there&#x27;s no attention placed on that summer, and people (probably rightly) assume that nothing interesting happened (it may come up in an interview why there&#x27;s a gap there, but I&#x27;ll get to what I think the parallel for that is). In the latter case, I&#x27;m being relatively uncooperative in the information-gathering process.<p>The connection to companies seems weak to me. When I go into a restaurant that neglects to post its food hygiene scores, I assume roughly the same as when I walk into a store and the cashier neglects to tell me if he has a criminal history. If I ask, and the restaurant tells me that it declines to answer, <i>that</i> seems more parallel to the question of declining to answer negative personal information. Similarly with the &quot;decline to answer&quot; case among people, I bet people would infer the worst of companies that &quot;actively&quot; declined to answer questions (versus those that neglected to bring it up).<p>These are interesting questions the researcher is asking, and it&#x27;s particularly interesting to think about how we craft our identities online, but I think they need to reflect more on the parallels they draw before concluding that dynamics are different.<p>edit: I&#x27;m looking up the paper itself, because it occurs to me that a mainstream news outlet is pretty likely to misreport the study&#x27;s design, results, discussion, etc... and it&#x27;d be unfair not to assume that the article writer (or I the reader) misunderstood something.",1439527732

It&#x27;s price was low enough and quality high enough that they have become somewhat ubiquitous, creating relatively low rental prices and creating a whole new generation of cinematographers that were able to skip the typical slow apprenticeship track (for better or worse).  An equally large game changer was the rise of the DSLR, opening the bottom of the market to a look previously unreachable for the price.<p>I love Blackmagic (have the pocket camera myself), but the difference in quality and cost between current DSLRs, the various REDs and the Ursa 4.6 is not great enough to categorize as a game changer.<p>I&#x27;ll probably pick up the new Ursa myself, but at this point the visual quality of the picture is the least of a filmmakers worry (check out Upstream Colour which was shot on a $1k GH2).

The idea was that when these changes happen, they tend to alter society in ways that couldn&#x27;t easily have been predicted beforehand.  It would have been hard to imagine the ubiquity of the internet or smartphones in our lives before they existed.  So what could the next major change be?  Self-driving cars on the scale where manual driving is illegal on city streets perhaps?  That actually isn&#x27;t too hard to envision.  Something else?<p>One thought that came out of that is that a major change I would love to see, although not a technological one, is for a major economy to implement a workable guaranteed basic income.  It&#x27;s been a popular subject on HN, and does seem to be starting to gain traction in the &#x27;real world&#x27;.  While obviously there are issues to solve, it&#x27;s something I see as really having a chance of working.  _Something_ will have to happen to address the growing inequality as technology keeps moving us closer to a post-scarcity society, and a basic income seems to fit the bill.<p>Or perhaps it will be something else.

They also spurred numerous asset bubbles through bad policy choices. It&#x27;s entirely understood that the Fed can cause asset bubbles by holding interest rates too low for too long. They&#x27;ve been aggressively using that understanding for the last six years.<p>The rich can deal with the dollar losing half of its value in a decade. Nobody else can. The rich have capital, and make a lot of money on the Fed&#x27;s intentional asset bubbles in real estate and stocks. The S&P 500 - and the wealthy who own most of it - benefits massively from a debased dollar, as their exports boom - while most of America suffers from a vast loss of purchasing power.<p>The end of the strong dollar of the 1990s, is what began the era of dramatically increased inequality. It&#x27;s not a coincidence. The currency race to the bottom, is really code for a decimation of the median standard of living. This is especially true in a country that consumes so much of its own manufacturing.<p>Debasing the dollar and sending commodities soaring benefited a very small group of people (Saudi Arabia, Canada, Australia, Norway, commodity investors). Who it didn&#x27;t benefit: US manufacturing that is consumed domestically. The oil price boom of the mid 2000&#x27;s, caused by the weak dollar, also harmed the US dramatically as deficits soared and the Middle East got uber rich. It acted as a huge wealth transfer to Canada as well.<p>The soaring inequality was caused by the Fed&#x27;s horrendous, and repetitive monetary policy mistakes. You&#x27;ll find people on the left go out of their way to evade ever pinning any blame to the Fed (it makes the welfare state possible through deficits and debt, so they love the Fed), and the people on the right don&#x27;t want to talk about inequality at all.<p>What did QE accomplish? Primarily it reinflated wealthy people&#x27;s balance sheets, and reinflated the housing market (which disproportionately benefits the top half in the US). The median net wealth of Americans still hasn&#x27;t recovered, even with housing and stocks so high. Skeptics will claim QE helped to heal the economy, generate jobs and so on - as though the US economy didn&#x27;t do that on its own for 200 years prior to the Fed utilizing QE.",1439525322

I would suggest reading the original works of Claude Shannon to become enlightened about how the word &#x27;information&#x27; is used in the context of math, electrical engineering, and computer science.<p>The manifestation of observational asymmetries absolutely must be equivocal to the asymmetry of manifest observation.  Therefore, the format of an observation is manifest via the symmetry of a relation under a set of attributes.  Thusly, the asymmetry of observations is a point measurably manifested by the difference in attributes.  That allows for the derivation of: a union operation over the observations; an intersection operation over the asymmetries; and a manifest closure property. This is how one may define points of &#x27;data&#x27; in the sense that is absolutely congruent with the terms database, big data, or data science.<p>Information Theory and Relational Algebra have some overlap, but they are not completely intertwined.  The subjects of Abstract Algebra and Information Geometry are there at the intersection, but they still too terminologically distinct to be taught in tandem.  The former subject is still best learned in French; whereas the latter subject is still best learned in Japanese.  It is possible for one to teach themselves these subjects by machine translation, if they have a deep understanding for the grammar and history of each language.

So the government started garnishing his wages.<p>He went to court because he was not the father and had never even met the mother, but the standard was &quot;the best interest of the child&quot; without exception. Since the child&#x27;s real father was unknown, receiving child support from an unrelated person is better for the child than not receiving it from anyone, so the court said he had to pay anyway.<p>By that logic, your colleague shouldn&#x27;t have to pay now that he has full custody of the children, because it isn&#x27;t in the best interest of the children for the parent with custody to be paying &quot;child support&quot; to the parent without custody.

929265,comment,928847,928913,0,0,Retric,,,"While that's true, the advantage of investing in mildly stable developing countries is such that we will run out of developing nations faster than you might think.  China has something like 40 years until it has US level consumption per person with India not all that far behind.  When 50% of the worlds population has modern education and  infrastructure the cost savings of shifting your work force around the world shrinks.  Japan might be the poster child for this transition but without massive destruction there is little to slow things down.<p>PS: The ability for science and technology to progress has had a lot to do with the number of people who focus on such things, when 80% of the world is developed we might see 10 times as much research which is then quickly spread around the globe.  And like the old VC equation having 1/3 of 50 trillion is worth less than 1/20th of 5,000 trillion.",1257688750

929260,comment,929153,929153,0,0,jamesbressi,,,"This is a very tough subject to comment on, and maybe why no one has yet.<p>I do believe that some vaccines are very important (like polio), but I don't believe that we should vaccinate for others (like chicken pox).  Know anyone that has had H1N1 yet? I bet you do and chances are they survived and found it  just about the same as regular flu, so why vaccinate the whole population for it? Now, I do believe high risk people should be vaccinated, like my girlfriend's father who had a kidney transplant (because if he gets the flu it can be life threatening).<p>I feel for this person who cannot send their child to daycare because other children are not vaccinated, but I'm not sure it is a reason to push vaccinations on others.<p>Please don't flame me for this; I hope you see that I'm just hitting on this from both sides and do sympathize.",1257688470

You want a lot of people using the latest release of your software so you can get an idea of where the bugs lie before your next version.<p>Besides that, what this blog is basically advocating is turning Ubuntu into Debian.  Perhaps there's a reason why Ubuntu is getting all the attention that Debian isn't getting?<p>And no, it isn't ""marketing"".  That's almost always a cop-out answer.",1257688275

929255,comment,928813,929139,0,0,rmanocha,,,"> Over the next 20 years, one side effect of this sort of bill might be to slow that innovation down.<p>There was an article in The Economist recently (unable to find the link - read a hard copy) which dispelled this myth. Research was done in some European countries (including the UK) which showed that introducing the NHS has not slowed down innovation. They also suggested some incentive plans to make sure innovation did not take a hit.<p>In either case, I think it's a long stretch to say that this bill, among other things, will lead to a reduced drug innovation. The money in the Drug business in the US and around the world will ensure that does not happen.",1257688187

929246,comment,929123,929233,0,0,ComputerGuru,,,"It very much is. Canonical purposely picked a release date to coincide with that of Windows 7. The Ubuntu community practically marketed this as the Second Coming and The Age of Linux (redux). And then they blew it.<p>Remember, it's the first impressions that count. Always. Someone who's hardware is wholly unsupported under the default Ubuntu configuration, crashing the PC or fscking up the display isn't going to try Ubuntu - or any other Linux - again anytime soon.<p>That's not to say that Ubuntu isn't a great distro. But like the article says, if you're going to market something, make that the best you've got. You don't enter a championship with your mediocre offerings when you've got loads better. Ubuntu can do, and indeed in the past has done, better so why this and why now?<p>Initial impressions == does it work or not. How badly is it going to mess up my existing configuration. How does the upgrade go. Is my hardware supported.<p>NOT initial impressions == how many windows you can wobble at once. Having the latest (and buggiest) version of framework X just for bragging rights or the need to get it out regardless of quality. Testing extensively under very limited conditions and barely for any of the slightly-out-of-the-mainstream cases.<p>EDIT: Wow, seem to have <i>really</i> struck a nerve to have reached -4. Would love to know what the downvotes are for, or if it's just a knee-jerk OSS reaction because I think I explained my POV quite well (whether you agree with it or not).",1257687139

But that is – again – not how it works. There are other players involved. Parts of the state might not be willing to use all that power. Other states (sometimes with vastly more power) will constrain the ability of the state to use all its power. And so on.<p>The consequence of all this is that revolutions against tyrannies are possible without firing a single shot or using any violence at all. Even though, just looking at the raw power of the two sides, the state could easily crush the population. Just think of the fall of the Berlin Wall.",1257686599

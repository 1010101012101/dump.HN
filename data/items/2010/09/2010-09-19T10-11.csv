1705971,comment,1705587,1705730,0,0,buro9,,,"> Last week, I committed to giving 10% of my income to charity henceforth forever.<p>I've been doing this for about 3 years now and not once have I found myself regretting it or unable to afford anything that I want.<p>I was originally inspired by some Muslim co-workers who told me about the compulsory charity that Islam prescribes for them, and the voluntary charity that they then make on top of it. 2.5% is compulsory for all Muslims, and then most top up to 10% as the voluntary portion is their way to give what God gave to them and by doing so show appreciation for what they have. This happens regardless of how much or little people earn.<p>Now, I am not religious by any definition, but I was embarrassed and ashamed at how most of my friends and especially myself were not really giving much at all. And I also felt that I could also appreciate what I have by giving some of it away.<p>Somewhere in an Orwell book I recall reading a bit where Orwell tried to tip a taxi driver a large amount. The taxi driver refused, ""I will still be poor tomorrow"". That 10%, I don't need it... that alone isn't the definition of rich that I use. Even a bonus once a year won't make me as happy as just working on things I am interested in. So it seems clear to me that I have more to gain by helping others less fortunate with those things than I do.",1284893762

However I suspect this is ''not'' the thief - even after such a short time. As pointed out elsewhere they will shift it off pretty quickly.<p>From the text of the mail the person probably knew it was dodgy. So it's probably been fenced and then sold on - the person probably knows or has a friend who knows the fence (but not the thief) [this is just a guess, but it is usually what happens].<p>Second the advice to get LE involved; in fact it is crucial that he does so. By reporting as much as possible the police know about all the crimes. So, for example, if they grab someone on theft and can't link him to the specific incident they are investigating they may still be able to link him to your theft - because it is on record (this happened the other month, we had a stolen laptop to examine, no evidence... but the serial number of the external HDD with it matched on reported stolen 10 months ago).<p>In terms of tracking down this person, there are a few ways to do it. Where did the email come from (i.e. webmail, or the PC?) and from what address? You might be able to geolocate an IP address to get a rough location (this is useful information for the police because they may be aware of fences/thieves in that area to question). If it is webmail the police would need a warrant, which they might get in this case due to the explicitness of the case.<p>If the laptop is signing into chat etc. then perhaps you could convince the person to talk directly to you via that - at which point the police could try to get a warrant for the chat providers records and track him down.<p>Move quickly, the IP information can go stale very quickly.",1284891837

A couple decades ago, when I learned about the rewrites, I decided to collect the originals, and compare them.  It was a fascinating experience.<p>Weingarten's phrasing above gets to the key elements. Racial stereotypes were removed-- the old versions were quite offensive to modern sensibilities at times-- along with about 1/3rd of the text.  Plots were simplified, and a much more formulaic approach to action (from one mini-cliffhanger to another) took over.  Descriptive passages were omitted, more often than not.<p>So: if you really want to read Leslie McFarlane, be sure to check out the pre-1959 editions.",1284891385

1705947,story,,,1,0,Hostymail,"Check out how federated search is different in SharePoint Server 2010 …",,"What is Federated Search in SharePoint Server 2010?
A Federated Search in SharePoint Server enables you to display search results for additional content that is not crawled by your search server. Using Federated Search, the query can be performed over the local content index, or it can be forwarded to an external content repository where it is processed by that repository’s search engine. The repository’s search engine then returns the results to the search server. The search server formats and renders the results from the external repository within the same search results page as the results from the search server’s own content index.
A federated location defines the federated search connection to the external content repository, and comprises Location types, Query and More Results link templates, Triggers, Display information, Restrictions, and Authentication and credentials information.
Benefits of Federated Search with SharePoint Enterprise Search
If you use Federated Search option to get search results, then:
• You require no additional capacity for the content index, as content is not crawled by SharePoint Enterprise Search
• You can take advantage of a repository’s existing search engine
• You can optimize the content repository’s search engine for the repository’s specific set of content, which might provide better search performance on the content set
• You can access repositories that are secured against crawls, but which can be accessed by search queries
<!–[if !supportLists]–>
All in all you can use SharePoint Server 2010 federated sources in core results, in a small preview of results, or in an instant answer format. Federated Results incorporate information from other sources, Related Searches, and People Results in the search experience.
Take advantage of SharePoint family of products that include SharePoint Server 2010, SharePoint Foundation 2010, MOSS 2007, and associated free SharePoint templates or web parts.",1284891124

I don't think it's about the coffee market in NY, or in general - it's about making sure you think and measure before you leap.<p>Starting a business is a huge deal and consumes huge amounts of your time. If the sums don't add up - that is, you're not going to be profitable unless you work as slave-labour in your own business - maybe you shouldn't do it. I think this is a trap that many educated people fall into that don't have direct business (or time billing) experience.<p>This is applicable to tech as well - if you build a product, sell it super cheap (say, software @ $20 per year), and it takes around 1 hour per year in technical support per user (per year), you need to consider that when pricing.

1705944,story,,,1,0,Hostymail,"Be secured using SharePoint Server 2010 Claims based Authentication",,"Today when duplicity problem has increased a lot, authentication has become a must. Authentication is the process of determining if someone is who they claim to be. It answers the question “Who is this guy really?” Taking advantage of SharePoint Server 2010 Claims Based Authentication feature may help you curb this duplicity issue.  Even if you are a SharePoint Foundation 2010 user, you can enjoy the same feature to authenticate the user identity.
Most enterprise applications need some basic user security features. At a minimum, they need to authenticate their users, and many also need to authorize access to certain features so that only privileged users can get to them. Some apps must go further and audit what the user does. On Windows®, these features are built into the operating system and are usually quite easy to integrate into an application. By taking advantage of Windows integrated authentication, you don’t have to invent your own authentication protocol or manage a user database. By using access control lists (ACLs), impersonation, and features such as groups, you can implement authorization with very little code. Indeed, this advice applies no matter which OS you are using. It’s almost always a better idea to integrate closely with the security features in your OS rather than reinventing those features yourself.
In the real world, we face the following challenges:
* Privacy regulations and other pieces of legislation are impacting what kind of information we are allowed to capture and store about users, so in some cases we can’t just demand that people give us all of their personal details.
* Businesses want to interoperate with other businesses, and government organizations want to provide more integrated services to citizens. However, different systems use different authentication systems and businesses want to integrate in a secure, legally compliant manner.
Consequently, claims based authentication in SharePoint Server is designed to address the two challenges mentioned above. Claims based authentication addresses privacy and other compliance concerns by requesting less specific, less personal information about people, and by trusting other parties or systems to do the “proof of identity” check. Claims based authentication addresses integration of different systems by allowing communications using open standards, and by providing a platform for developing more specialized ‘identity connectors’ between systems.
How to implement Claims based authentication?
The claims-based authentication is implemented in the following way:
* From a developer’s point of view, the platform that Microsoft is providing is called the Windows Identity Foundation. Earlier, it was called the Geneva framework. It provides a programming library suitable for building claims-aware applications. This library is also used by SharePoint 2010
* Active Directory Federation Services implement services to create, accept, and transform tokens that contain claims.
* Cardspace provides a user interface for users to select which “identity card” they wish to use for a particular system
Claims based authentication won’t address the lifecycle management of identity information.
Claims based authentication may let our system know that a user is a contractor from a partner company, but it alone won’t let us specify a rule that says “all of my company’s financial spreadsheets must not be seen by contractors”. Not only does claims based authentication not provide this capability, but neither do the role-based access controls provided by SharePoint. In fact SharePoint’s role-based access control model itself is too limited to address this. It still needs substantial improvements.
Claims based authentication feature was not available in MOSS 2007; SharePoint Server 2007 uses a native Active Directory-based authentication between machines and systems. In addition to claims based authentication, take advantage of other exclusive features in SharePoint Server 2010 and also enjoy some free SharePoint templates or web parts that come with SharePoint products.",1284891054

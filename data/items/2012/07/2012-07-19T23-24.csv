There's nothing inheritantly different about mobile that prevents web apps running as well as they do on the desktop.  You are aware that on the desktop JavaScript engines like V8 can keep up with any garbage-collected language, right?  There are a few reasons why things are progressing slower on mobile, among them:<p>1) There is very little browser competition on mobile. Users are either unaware of or don't see the benefit to downloading an alternate browser, and as a result the OS vendors have less of an incentive to improve their browser rapidly.  On the desktop browsers like Firefox and Chrome release a new version every few weeks, whereas on mobile the OS vendors release once or a twice a year.<p>2) The JS engines haven't been optimized for ARM as heavily as x86. We'll get there though.<p>These are very much short-term problems. And despite that, you can write performant mobile web-apps today.

If you care about making your code smaller (which reduces the occurrence of bugs), making it more readable, etc., and performance isn't much of an issue, then it probably is a win. If you care about getting maximum performance... well, then, you need to get a good knowledge of the target system's performance characteristics and how language features are implemented in order to decide if it's a win or not (or, y'know, just profile the two options, I guess); it's entirely possible that a string of pointer dereferences might turn out to actually be faster than a conditional branch anyway.",1342741476

I think thats the real key here: Im not paying for the sensation of a hypothetical idea, so much as paying to support the individuals whom I like and admire.

There is a lemming effect same reason people will follow people who park their cars on the lawn at an event (even if the sign says ""no parking"") or ignore a persons plea (famous NYC case years ago) if others aren't doing something.<p>That to me is the behavior that is going on with kickstarter. You see others are contributing. You wonder if they know something you don't. You decide to take advantage.<p>Edit: ""You wonder if they know something you don't."" I probably didn't state this as well as I could. In the shortness of time let's look at it this way. You see a pebble watch raises a million dollars on kickstarter.

For example, if a set of things that must be performed in order; and sometimes some of those steps are missing, instead of performing a null-check, you can have a default no-op case; that way, instead of:<p><pre><code>   if(firstAction != null) firstAction();
   if(secondAction != null) secondAction();
   if(thirdAction != null) thirdAction();
</code></pre>
in your inner loop, you can have:<p><pre><code>   firstAction();
   secondAction();
   thirdAction();
</code></pre>
While whenever firstAction, secondAction, thirdAction are set, you can say:<p><pre><code>   firstAction = newFirstAction ?? noop;
   // etc.
</code></pre>
All in all, I'm glad this sort of knowledge is getting out there. I'm just grateful for my having really, really good CS teachers back in highschool ( I don't remember my college talking about OO as a way of removing if-statements ).<p>* Users of Java, of course, will just need to write a NoOp instance of their interface to take advantage of this.",1342739383

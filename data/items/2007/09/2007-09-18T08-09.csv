56196,comment,55990,56163,0,0,shawndrost,,,"SPOILER<p>It took me a long time to articulate what new information was being given; much longer than answering the question itself.  The trick is to imagine a smaller scale.  Lets say there were three each of brown- and blue-eyed people.  And let's call the blue-eyed people 1, 2, and 3.  Everyone knows that everyone sees at least one blue-eyed person, so no new information, right?  <p>Look at this fact: before the announcement, 1 doesn't know if 2 knows if 3 sees a blue-eyed person.  (2 knows if 3 sees a blue-eyed person, because 2 knows that 1 has blue eyes, but 1 doesn't know any of that.)  <p>Then, after the announcement, the first night passes and 3 doesn't go home -- so now 1 knows that 2 knows that 3 sees a blue-eyed person.  That's the new knowledge.<p>To finish the riddle, now 1 can reason like this: if my eyes are brown, then 2 knows her eyes are blue, because 2 knows 3 sees a blue-eyed person.  (That's the new knowledge.)  So if 2 goes home, my eyes are brown.  And if my eyes are blue, then 2 will know that 3 sees a blue-eyed person that isn't me, and 2 won't go home.  Either way, 1 goes home the 3rd night.  And 2 and 3 are actually in the same position, and they go home too.  <p>(It seems like the brown-eyed people go home the next night, but I forget and am too lazy to think about it rigorously again.)<p>If you want to analyze this for n=4, start with this fact: 1 doesn't know if 2 knows if 3 knows if 4 sees a blue-eyed person.  Don't try this if you're sleepy.",1190105664

56189,comment,56159,56159,0,0,uuilly,,,"They're doing a bunch of bit voodoo.  The ^ operator is XOR, '<<' shifts bits left and '&' is a bitwise AND. That's what they are in C++ at least.  <p>x = a&x ? a&b : c+x 
is a lot like the C++ shorthand if-then-else thingamabob:
x = ( 1 < 0 ) ? 10 : -10;
which translates to:
x = 10 if 1 < 0 else x = -10.<p>Not sure what they mean with their thingamabob though.  ",1190104684

Telescope technology hasn't changed much since then.  The engineering has gotten better though -- we spend money to get as many photons as possible.  <p>---<p>In regards to the ""X beats HST"" stories that seem to constantly populate the news: there's no optical telescope/instrument out there that can image as faint as HST, over such a wide field of view, with such high resolution.  There won't be for at least another decade.

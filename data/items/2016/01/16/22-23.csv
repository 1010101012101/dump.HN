This is a straw-man argument.<p>> form of support<p>The entire point of implementing a proper progressively enhanced design is that you <i>don&#x27;t</i> need to add extra support for older browsers. Handling missing features is important because &quot;older browsers&quot; isn&#x27;t the only time errors happen.<p>Progressive enhancement is mostly good error checking. You should handle missing JS features (or missing JS entirely) for the same reason you should be checking calls to fopen(3) for NULL; skipping that check means you simply fail badly on errors. A webpage that sends an empty body tag is similar to a traditional program that crashes without any error message because it tried to use a NULL file handle when opening it&#x27;s config file.<p>If your tools aren&#x27;t handling a lot of this for you (Rails has since very early versions), maybe get better tools or maybe bug vendor?<p>> usable interface<p>Nobody expects <i>identical</i> functionality when the JS doesn&#x27;t load. Obviously, some features won&#x27;t work, and it may not look as nice. Choosing exactly how to handle an error condition is one of the many design decisions programmers have to make. Skipping optional features like dynamic page rewriting (pjax or even simple remote ajax forms) may be slower, but skipping those features and leaving links/forms as traditional page-reloads is a better way to handle a failed JS download than blocking the entire page with an error message (or worse: leaving the person who visited your site with a blank page).<p>// I <i>suspect</i> that a lot of the &quot;interface&quot; that is apparently so important to get right is <i>advertising</i>.",1452984505

By encouraging their preference, TfL effectively halves the capacity of the escalator in question, and creates significantly more crowding below, slowing everyone down. &quot;\nIt doesn&#x27;t make sense that this would &quot;halve the capacity&quot; unless no one was walking. It seems that with a 40% stated preference for walking, it would be only a 10% loss of capacity due to preference differences. The description should really also include a description of how fast walking is compared to standing. Elevators move at around 0.3 m/s, people walk at about 4x that pace, so even doubling the spacing requirements would shave a fair bit off of that.<p>I think this result is a due to it only being tried on one of three up escalators. By the assumption that there are 6 lanes, devoting 1/3 to walkers and 2/3 to standers can lead to greater efficiency if that more closely matches the actual preference distribution. By maintaining choice, and matching the available options to those desired by passengers one can optimize the results for both those who prefer speed and those who prefer not expending energy.",1452983483

So it&#x27;s bizarre to see his thought appropriated to that end. He was, in fact, extremely concerned  with the difference between culture that is merely popular and a genuine, healthy, thriving culture. He saw academics and journalists as frequent accomplices in the destruction of a thriving, healthy culture by their appeals to popular taste and public opinion. By their spinning rigorous sounding tales that merely served to comfort (or discomfort) individuals and reinforce their existing opinions no matter how deleterious or suspect such opinions were (eg. about morality, the nobility of the common man, the goodness/badness of state institutions, etc). Additionally, he was just as concerned about the  influence exerted by nation states on thought as he was about the similar influence exerted by public opinion, common sense, and mainstream culture.<p>To simplify the formula down to &quot;mainstream culture&quot; vs. &quot;the state influenced academics&quot; is to be overly reductionist and to overlook the part every segment of society plays in producing uncritical thought.<p>For more clarity here I would read Nietzsche&#x27;s &quot;Untimely Meditation&quot; on &#x27;cultural philistinism&#x27; - &quot;David Strauss: the confessor and the writer&quot;, and &quot;Beyond Good and Evil&quot; namely the section &quot;Peoples and Fatherlands&quot; for an idea of his approach to critique of mainstream culture in his time.",1452982888

Netflix will never air a show that questions the Holocaust because it could result in it&#x27;s bankruptcy.<p>While I&#x27;m not a Holocaust denier, I do believe everything can in principle be questioned, including our most sacred beliefs, or especially those - and perpetually reaffirmed. To expunge critical inquiry from any topic, as long as it&#x27;s not disguised propaganda, means to live on a flat Earth where everything was revealed and there is nothing more to know. And to do that in Academia - by definition a space shielded from popular pressure exactly to give it the freedom it needs in pursuit of knowledge and truth - is a cultural crime Amazon just can&#x27;t fix.",1452982336

My time has a numerical number attached to it. As a tangible example, my revenue for my company is $125 an hour. I ended up interviewing 10 people for our most recent junior level hire. 2 of them were duds, immediately costing the company $250. The rest of them each spent about 2.5 hours with me: $2500. 4 were invited back, spending about 4 hours each with me: $2000. 1 was invited back to spend the day with me pair programming. I&#x27;ll discount this at half price, given that I was still able to accomplish something: $500. They didn&#x27;t end up taking the job offer, so I invited my second choice in for the same deal: $500. I ended up hiring them. 10 people cost the company $5,750. Read back through what I wrote, and you&#x27;ll notice I said &quot;I&quot;. I&#x27;m solely talking about my contribution to being in an interview room, not even accounting for my coworkers&#x27; contributions, nor the time spent with resumes. Now read back through it again, and replace &quot;company&quot; with &quot;fellow employees&quot;. My &quot;selfish&quot; approach saves my coworkers money by eliminating candidates who were statistically unlikely to get the job anyway. If that&#x27;s truly selfish, sign me up any day of the week.<p>For some more context, go flip through linkedIn profiles of people with <5 years of work experience and you&#x27;ll see a strong trend: (5 months) (5 months) (3 months) (7 months). Not even 2 years and 4 &quot;full time&quot; jobs. Going back to the hiring numbers, intro_to_hiring puts the cost of replacement equal to their salary. Now imagine my hire follows this trend. I&#x27;ve spent $15k on finding them, $10k on training them, $40k in salary, and now I have to spend another $80k replacing them. All of that in a span of 6 months. Sounds like a pretty one-sided deal. All said and done, I struggle to believe I&#x27;m the selfish asshole of the story.",1452981775

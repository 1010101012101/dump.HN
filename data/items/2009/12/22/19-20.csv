I enjoy the peace and quiet when no one is around to bother you. During the day there are endless distractions but at night that all goes away. As I said, I used to be like this, now I have a baby and being a night owl is no longer an option. I have been progressively migrating towards starting my day at 7am, and I have to admit, I enjoy it. Yeah I've had some great late night hacking sessions, but being able to start working early and be done by 5 or 6 is very nice.<p>I find it much easier to separate work from home life when I start my day with work, as opposed to spending all day knowing that at some point I will in fact have to get to work. I've found that having things hang over my head like that really messes with my motivations, I prefer to take the approach of work or don't work, but nothing in between.<p>I also work from home, which is not only complicated by the fact that I have a baby at home, but also that my office is sitting off in a corner in the living room. The best solution I have found is to find a way to isolate yourself and convince your mind that you are in the same mode as if you were working late at night without anyone around. I have a nice pair of headphones that block out most noise, and I purchased standing paper room dividers so I can 'shut' my door and focus on work.<p>So while I've had a lot of fun being a night owl hacker, I find I live a more balanced productive life getting work done first and early. As they say, business before pleasure, with a personal corollary of don't combine the two.",1261511973

I'm going to assume that you are a programmer since you are assuming this is simply a programming problem.<p>I am a sysadmin, and I can tell you that I outgrew cute server names many years ago because they hurt more than they could ever help. Reading this thread, it is painfully obvious to me that most people here have not been meaningfully exposed to large server installations. The last time I had servers with cute names, there were 12 machines total. Since then, I've worked in environments with hundreds and thousands of hosts.<p>Even past a couple dozen servers, cute names become a liability and a significant distraction. Divining purpose, location, and other meaning by looking at a cute name when you have 30 servers is difficult and unnecessary. Applying the 3am standard (can a sleep deprived sysadmin do this task with minimal error at 3am?) cute names actually become rather cruel. The answer is to build an inventory system that lets the sysadmin map cute names to functional information. Or simply build that functional information in to the naming scheme.<p>So sorry guys. As a professional sysadmin and fellow engineer I appreciate that you are looking out for what you perceive to be our sysadmin needs, but cute names are one thing we don't want or need.

The parties are just coalitions of interests and voter demographics, not philosophies - you might as well talk about what direction a plate of spaghetti points at.<p>And as for conservatives' ""political system"" - <i>whose</i>?  Do you mean evangelicals and other theocrats, PNAC neocons, populist teabaggers, or Lew Rockwell/Ron Paul fans?  We're not talking remotely the degree of unity imposed by the Politburo and Comintern upon the global communist movement when it comes to either US party.  In a bipolar system, both parties must be big tents or be crushed by the bigger tent.  Elected officials are not (and Bush was not) advancing a single ""conservative"" or ""liberal"" ideology; they're trying to please various power blocs who agree or disagree with them on different issues.<p>Bush's failures highlight the failure of particular policies and ideas, but they don't say much about the ideas of self-described ""real conservatives"" who thought Bush was a ridiculously free-spending, anti-federal, protectionist, power-consolidating, Big Government guy long before Iraq.

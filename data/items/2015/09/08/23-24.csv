It&#x27;s very possible to use inline styles without adding unnecessary power to the declaration language - heck, you could declare them in JSON and load them during the build step if you want. How you use inline styles is your decision.",1441756799

Saying that there is no reversion to the mean implies being a martingale with respect to the weakest possible information set (the history of prices).  Traders, whether high frequency or others, may have extra information outside this information set.<p>In short, stop nitpicking and revise your understanding of what a martingale is.",1441756793

American preschools are way behind French preschools in terms of academic preparation, and yet French children aren&#x27;t exhibiting the same kinds of problems.<p>If it really is a play issue, it&#x27;s more likely that American parents don&#x27;t allow their children more freedom on the playground, instead helicoptering around (I&#x27;m guilty) and not allowing them to just handle things themselves.",1441756719
10188892,comment,10188796,10188796,0,0,AndrewUnmuted,,,"Reading this made me sad, but for a different reason than I&#x27;d anticipated when I first started reading. The trigger for me was the realization that our children are not having the conversations that they ought to be having.<p>Talking with/to children is important for their mental development, or so I have been told. I am no expert on this matter, but this is what I have come to understand. It&#x27;s rooted on the understanding that social expertise is developed by means of continual practice; if kids do not play/socialize/work together at a young age, they risk not sufficiently developing this skill as they grow.<p>If we are seeing anti-social behavior from children these days it would seem that trends in contemporary society have caused a decline in the opportunities kids have for conversing with others. The lacking development of our auditory sensory skills means a lacking development in the other sensory categories - speaking and hearing are the categories we master first as humans.<p>I don&#x27;t believe the cause of this is limited to the apparent advances in the stupidity of early childhood educators, as it is likely that the on-demand exposure to engaging media content at younger ages and other related trends are also to blame. After all, if a kid is staring at a screen, they are not developing their social functions, either.<p>In general, I believe this damage can be sourced back to the general trends of the modern household, which has both parents working full-time just to get by economically. The humans with which the child is most willing to converse are not available and instead the child is left in a scenario that more resembles Lord of the Flies.<p>This is all why I, personally, do not plan to bring children into this world until I can afford the time to raise them with the love and attention they deserve. So that the availability of finances has no bearing on their future. I owe any being I bring into this earth at least that courtesy.",1441756702

I&#x27;ve wanted for a while to understand how to, say, perform unsupervised training on my iMessage, Facebook and Slack history (which spans many years now) to tag messages, threads, and people with topics, sentiment, frequency, etc. I want to correlate that data with other time-series metrics that I either already have it can acquire easily enough, such as weather, medications taken, apps I have open on my desktop (which could signal context), to see if there are any interesting correlations. I have always thought that depression, anxiety, and AD/HD have had their own impacts on my life that are impossible to quantify without this sort of thing exercise, which could help me understand myself better, and help create a tool chain that would let others get the same kind of insight into their own data. I had always planned to make an open source kit of scripts or maybe Python notebooks out of the endeavor.<p>Things that I get stuck on, which then takes the wind out of my sails: tokenization (specifically handling the Unicode Emoji entities and ascribing meaning to them - Do I use them as tags/signals, or replace with synonyms?), lemmatizing (do I spend time going down the rabbit hole of simplifying all lines of chat to their most basic words?), grouping likes of dialog (if my reply was within ten minutes, consider it part of a &quot;conversation&quot; object), and how best to time stamp things (everything is individually stamped, but for some correlations, the time of day is the important bucket - for others, it may be the calendar day/season/busy work day).<p>It&#x27;s such a huge domain, I keep spinning my wheels trying to feel like I&#x27;m going down a path that will lead to some form of success, no matter how small.<p>Another topic I&#x27;ve tried getting into is using ML to process my Hearthstone logs (live, not historical) to try my own approach on an unreleased project I recently read about that sought to predict opponent&#x27;s cards. My thought was to create a series of dicts from popular &quot;net decking&quot; sites and compute cosine similarity between the cards an opponent has already played - the other project used game histories to predict the &quot;next card&quot;, and I was seeking to predict which archetype my opponent is likely playing, since my own domain knowledge would figure out their likely &quot;signature moves&quot; once I had that clue. I&#x27;d maybe expand on it to predict how likely it is the opponent can go lethal on their next turn, given the cards they likely have and the ones on the board. With that topic, I&#x27;ve been trying to figure out state machines and various data structures in Python. Computing similarity I&#x27;ve figured out, with Counters seems to work, but the mechanics of doing so against potentially hundreds of &quot;net decks&quot; is challenging. Is a comprehension the way to go? A matrix function? I have no idea.<p>I guess I&#x27;m making this big dump of my own thoughts to see if anyone has any pointers, guidance, example projects, or general knowledge to share or direct me to that could help me figure this stuff out, because I&#x27;m excited to learn and I learn best when I have a pet project to which I can apply my newfound knowledge.<p>Anyone in the same boat?

Greek approach to science is roughly represented by Plato and Pythagoras, where they have a disdain for arithmetical computations and a reverence for the beauty of the mathematical proof, particularly in geometry. Mesopotamia/Babylon, India, and China on the other had a more empirical approach to mathematics, with emphasis on arithmetic, number theory, and so on. Obviously, exceptions exist, for example, Archimedes. Greek is the Platonic ideal- math existing in a different realm uncorrupted by the real world, while Babylonian is the mathematics (and beauty therein) of trade and architecture- modeling the real world using mathematics.<p>Edit: Further, the theory is, when Islamic conquest and the Silk Route connected the west and east through Central Asia and Europe, there was syncretism. In addition to Islamic scholars&#x27; rediscovery of the Greek philosophers, they also combined this with ideas from India which via Fibonacci and others made its way to Europe in its new integrated form, right before the Renaissance.<p>[1] E.

10188718,comment,10186644,10186644,0,0,grownseed,,,"Talking from a slightly different perspective - the public health sector (so not the US) - I can also confirm that a number of the major problems in healthcare stem from entrenched cultural values. Most healthcare staff I work with or have met are really adverse to change. One must understand however that it is not change itself that they usually dislike, it is everything that comes with it.<p>Historically, healthcare, particularly the public kind, has proven to be riddled with senseless bureaucracy, and trust me, I don&#x27;t mean that lightly. A simple change to a procedure will require filing forms upon forms, countless layers of approval (often from people who have little to no relevance on the matter), using completely antiquated systems, etc. The first step to facilitating the acceptance of change is to cut the bullshit, to let people do their jobs, but that too is made very hard.<p>When ills and death are at the core of your field, it&#x27;s easy to see how people will constantly look to assign or shift blame. Bureaucracy, in its own very messed up way, attempts to fix this but instead ends up tripping over itself, repeatedly and increasingly. Costs that should have been divided and spread instead end up being multiplied and painfully reworked to match the different sources of funding.<p>Another major pain point in the public health sector (at least in Canada) which the OP indirectly touches on is the drastic lack of common business skills among leaders. In fact, the hierarchy and the &quot;power pyramid&quot; are completely and utterly devoid of any common business sense. Authority and management positions are aquired purely on the basis of seniority and academic fame (a whole story by itself...), but not a single drop of management skills is ever required. It is not uncommon to see well networked researchers make it to the top while having no social skills, no business experience and no leadership skills, all the while directly or indirectly, and often unknowingly, affecting hundreds of healthcare workers, and ultimately the patients. Redundant effort (duplicated research, processes, etc.) is rampant, entire departments can have several, unrelated heads, or conversely, exist in near vacuum with nobody to be held accountable (again, worthy of a dedicated story).<p>In this convoluted context, people will seek to bypass the rules or bend them so far that the rules themselves stop making sense. People at the top will often officially hold different supposedly full-time positions (!) to get their salaries increased (because the current process, particularly with recently-enforced unionization, no longer allows for individual raises, and because funding is so fundamentally messed up). The &quot;ground&quot; staff will often do whatever it takes to satisfy the rules, often in ways that don&#x27;t satisfy the original aim of the rules but that allow work to be pushed through. As an example, I pointed out severe security issues in our organization ; the response was to create a security council that would decide how to act on it. The result was official (ISO) standards are now being implemented (more than a year later) with people scratching their heads to find the most creative ways to meet those standards, so swaths of new standard operating procedures are being designed, which will themselves require validation, through validation processes that do not yet exist. Meanwhile, nearly all the security issues I identified back then are still well and truly alive, but the illusion (or rather, public appearance) of security apparently matters more politically than actual security.<p>The topics I have discussed here barely blow the dust off of the old proverbial healthcare book. As much as I feel rewarded by my professional position in a technical way (and there is obviously a lot to do), I can&#x27;t help but feel bitter about the state of the system as a whole, about people&#x27;s attitude towards healthcare on all sides of the equation. My personal efforts and suggestions to improve public healthcare are often met with the perennial &quot;eh, what can you do?&quot; that disillusioned, blasé healthcare workers have grown accustomed to.<p>Should anybody out there want to hear or discuss some of my thoughts on how to fix (public) healthcare, or is already actively working on it, please feel free to contact me, I&#x27;m kinder than I may appear :)",1441753633

It&#x27;s not a subway, so no digging, and the land is cheaper, but all the same. Something like this would be unimaginable in CA to take less than 15 years.

The 64kb era was effectively ushered in with the C64 and 800XL in 1982, but 128kb came a few years later and concurrent with a market shift to 16-bit CPUs. Accessing that much memory on an 8-bit isn&#x27;t a natural fit for their addressing capability, even though there are several examples of models shipping with it.<p>(In a lot of ways memory posed a bigger problem than CPU time back then.)",1441753356

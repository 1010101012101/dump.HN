(Electrics have regenerative braking, so stopping one train can be used to power another.)  That means either lots of stops or hills; a train going down can power a train going up.<p>While trains spend a lot of money on fuel, it isn't a big fraction of their costs, so even free fuel can't make a huge difference in total train costs.<p>Moreover, electrification is very expensive.  It's so expensive that electrification plan for the CalTrain corridor (San Jose to San Francisco), which is pretty much a best-case for electrification due to the frequent stops, doesn't mention cost-savings as a reason.

Based on what the story says, spammers are potentially earning about $2 million a year. I suppose larger spammers could be earning 3 - 4x that (so, $6 - 8 million), and this obviously isn't chump change.<p>This study points out what we already know, though: there is a problem with email. The barrier to entry is too low which is both a blessing and a curse. It allows people communicate with ease, but it also allows people to send millions or billions of emails at little or no cost to them. Now, I know that these are hijacked computers, but the point remains that since it is so easy and cost-efficient to send email, it becomes profitable at virtually <i>any scale</i> because of the non-existent cost.<p>I'm not saying that we should charge for every email, since that may not be a viable solution (though it could work), but there does need to be something done besides continuously improving our spam filters.<p>Also, isn't the methodology used by the researchers technically illegal?<p>""The team used these machines to control a total of 75,869 hijacked machines and routed their own fake spam campaigns through them.""",1226350416

359706,comment,359551,359646,0,0,prospero,,,"Rand's vilification of people who disagree with her is irritating, but what's more troublesome is the victim mentality that goes along with it.  Inevitably the protagonist (who is handsome, smart, determined, and surprisingly domineering in the bedroom) is held back by the mediocrity of the masses.  If only circumstances were different, the books tell us over and over again, our hero could achieve his true potential.<p>This, to me, is a cop-out.  Most proponents of Objectivism never make something excellent, they just talk a lot about how they could,  maybe, if only things were different.  Or, in an amusing variation, they can just declare themselves to have achieved excellence (Ayn Rand once declared herself ""the best writer today"") in spite of the opposition.<p>Both of these approaches seem to sidestep the very real challenges of making something great and enduring. While I think the comparison to Gladwell is apples to oranges, I much prefer his attempts to quantify what make someone exceptional to Rand's ineffable ""greatness"".",1226350228

359703,comment,359551,359602,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"As far as I'm concerned they're talking about two orthogonal subjects, and I think it takes a bit of cloudy thinking to conflate the two.<p>Rand never posited that people are <i>born</i> productive.  Productive people are productive by virtue of doing things, in Ayn's world...while a lot of other people are envious of the doing and stand in their way.  People can <i>become</i> productive.  Individualism requires that people can do whatever it is they want to do, as long as it doesn't harm another.  Rand wasn't talking about what childhood occurrences make for a Galt or a Roarke.  Perhaps she believed they were pre-destined, but I can't think of a single instance where that was indicated in her writing (and I went through a two year Rand phase in college...I've read just about everything she ever wrote).  And certainly not in Atlas Shrugged or The Fountainhead.<p>Gladwell, on the other hand, is saying that people we view as stars in their field are sometimes given a more obvious path to becoming stars than others, and thus things society does can help or hinder people who would be productive.  I don't think Rand would argue that there aren't people in the world who can help you as well as people in the world who can hinder you.<p>Note that I'm not making any judgment call on either idea.  I'm just not seeing how anyone could come away thinking this article is a useful addition to the subject (or subjects, in this case, since there are two under discussion, and somehow the author believes they contradict one another).  I agree with others that this is blogspam, making use of hot button names like Gladwell and Rand.  It's almost as if they have a machine that churns out high hit ideas...",1226350167

359679,comment,359041,359172,0,0,lionhearted,,,"Above really nailed some important points - the biggest is feeling like you're in control of your life. Whenever you blame something external for something you had <i>any</i> chance of affecting, you way disempower yourself. Not mental voodoo here - if you feel like your relationship had no chance independent of what you did, then why bother trying? Things like that.<p>Next point is really harsh - there's no way you turned in all-star caliber work at your last post. And if you want exceptions, you've got to be really, really good. Because managers really fear giving exceptions, because then everyone wants them. A lot of managers take the easy road and don't accommodate staff at all - they're not mean, it's just that once you stop having a consistent set of across-the-board policies it becomes really hard to balance everything and keep everyone on track. It just takes a high level of skill and personal touch that most managers don't have. Now, if you're amazing, like the most important person that's ever worked there, they might find a way to accommodate you. If you're another cog in the wheel, then rightfully or not, they probably don't gun hard to keep you specifically as that cog if you need accommodation. (That's not to say whether that's right or not - it's just how it is)<p>If you want to get different hours from other people, highlight how much it'd benefit your employer and tell them right from the start. ""Hi XYZ Company, I'm sleepy. I have this sleep thing but I do exceptional work. If you're flexible, I typically enjoy working 50-60 hours per week, but I've got to do some at night. I'd love to find a way to make this work - and it'd be cool to have someone alive and alert when the company's normally sleeping right? I can be that guy, and I pride myself on getting more done than everyone else.""<p>The average person only does 2 hours of productive work each day - you can double the average person's production by not procrastinating and focusing for 5 hours a day. If you're the best guy on the team, you get more slack.<p>Finally, if you want to contract - easiest way to start is by taking Freelance work somewhere like Elance or Odesk. Log onto to one of their sites, create an account, then bid the minimum possible for your first job and knock it out of the park. If you do 4-5 jobs below market rates and get excellent feedback, you'll be able to get work at market rates pretty fast.",1226349308

While it's nice to think that the founders of Facebook and MySpace really wanted to create ways for people to connect, in reality they were creating a service with mass-adoption potential in the most highly sought-after demographics.

The latter one refers to people that are so busy trying to excel in their field that they don't have time to think about working out or designing a program for success.<p>Setting goals, designing a fitness program, and meeting other geeks or ambitious types would be fun. Make it a way to meet new people, network, socialize, and get fit at the same time. None of that is possible online or at home in front of a DVD player. The value-added is all in the physical world- real people, real friends, real equipment. The value add is in how you address your chosen niche- as geeks, as ambitious young professionals. Trouble is, the people with money are baby boomers aged 45+. Then again, they just haven taken a 30% hit in widows and orphans stocks!!! Good luck, and if this idea doesn't work, start building the next one. Today.",1226348137

359648,comment,359315,359427,0,0,ssharp,,,"Of course this is the answer but a lot of management doesn't understand this.  If you take a look at Japanese manufacturers, you can see that they actually value their employees.<p>However, in the case of the UAW, management laid down for them for decades in fear of production cuts.  When the income was rolling in, the worst thing for them was a production shutdown.  They weren't forward thinking enough to realize that eventually these relatively unskilled workers would be making $40/hour on an assembly line and getting ridiculous health care benefits in their pensions.  It's a double-edged sword but a lot of baby boomers ended up making a lot more money then they ever should have.<p>Now, when any group of employees wants to organize, most management immediately thinks of what the UAW has done and thinks its the worst thing in the world.  They think that it's 100% employee greed and don't look at themselves for answers.  In reality, most unions organize today because management is really bad in creating a good work environment.  A little DAILY effort goes a long way in making your employees feel valued and as long as the compensation is somewhat close to average, you're not likely going to face a union coming in.",1226348041

Rand writes fiction; Gladwell writes theories based on anecdotes and statistics. For an analogy, that'd be a lot like saying ""Pablo Piccasso, or xyz modern photographer: Who is right?""<p>The guy's synopsis of Rand is pretty telling --> ""Atlas Shrugged is a similar story. In it a group of scientists and tycoons decide in equally petulant fashion decide that they will ""simply take their ball and go home"" when society refuses to capitulate to their capricious demands.""<p>Rand misses some points, the world isn't so black and white. But her general message is pro-individualism, hard work, anti-politicking, pro-competition, etc. It's anti-interventionism, anti-socialism, anti-labor, etc. It also mocks the hell out of people who come from opposite backgrounds, and interprets their motivations as scared and selfish. It makes for a good read, but makes her books hard to discuss with people from those viewpoints.<p>In reality, most people who are pro-collective, pro-socialism, etc. are decent folk with great intentions. Free marketists and socialists just happen to violently disagree on how to build the best world. Unfortunately, Rand's ruthless treatment of people who disagree with her all being nincompoops makes the books hard to discuss with someone who doesn't already have some of the underpinnings of her philosophy.",1226348014

In this case X is increase usage of wind power and Y is upgrade the power grid and add energy storage.

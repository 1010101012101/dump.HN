The rest of us hardly have a say.  In terms of personal freedom, this is just as bad as a command economy (no more, no less).  Also, remember that in some places, people can&#x27;t even chose their employer.  It&#x27;s work in the mine, or starve.  We westerners have it easy.<p>An independent contractor will still need to work to survive.  But at least she&#x27;s free from any boss… <i>if</i> she&#x27;s really independent —that is, she can afford to turn down contracts.<p>Pensioners, or otherwise &quot;financially independent&quot; people are even free from lucrative work.  They don&#x27;t need to work for their continued survival.  They can instead like look over their grandchildren or do some community work.<p>I&#x27;m sure there are higher attainable degrees of freedom yet.  But let&#x27;s work on the worst problems first.

10176372,comment,10175296,10175296,0,0,tel,,,"I still honestly haven&#x27;t given this enough time to digest—my Java-fu is quite rusty so I&#x27;m sort of reading between the lines on what I know about delimited continuations generally.<p>First I want to state that delimited continuations form a monad and (I believe) that in order to get the Java implementation working you need to implement that monad in the &quot;ambient monad&quot; of Java.<p>Second, I want to dissect the notion of &quot;monad&quot; as used here into two pieces. First, there is the &quot;PFP Notion&quot; of monad which tends to be represented as a data type and some associated operations. Actually, I mean this even more specifically as being aimed <i>precisely</i> at the standard library monads of Haskell. Secondly, there&#x27;s the mathematical &quot;monad&quot; which is just a qualifier assigned to any structure which satisfies the monad laws.<p>Delimited continuations are <i>definitely</i> a mathematical monad. They are represented by one PFP monad, but are generally eschewed as a style there. Why? Because delimited continuations are very &quot;large&quot; and PFP tends to favor the idea of having your data &quot;forbid invalid state&quot; so... large types are disfavored.<p>So now, to the third point: I think this is all just &quot;implementing a specific overlarge monad in Java and Clojure&quot;. It turns out that this is really convenient because overlarge things <i>always are</i>. They are of course more convenient in PFP, too. But this convenience has the price of making code difficult to treat as data, difficult to analyze statically.<p>All that said, it doesn&#x27;t mean at all that this isn&#x27;t a useful technique for implementation of monads in Java/Clojure.<p>Four, what about composability? (Specifically, here, we mean functor composition.) Turns out that delcont composes nicely compared to the PFP-style monads. The reason why is again because of lack of restrictions on state space. Non-composability of monads is a <i>good thing</i> because it relates to non-commutativity of certain effects.<p>You can get better composability in three ways: throw out all the non-commutative effects, work with subsets of effects a particular ambient monad (see Purescript&#x27;s impl of Eff), split the specification of effects from the implementation of effects and leave the decision of ordering up to the implementer (see Haskell&#x27;s mtl).<p>If you don&#x27;t want any of the above, just realize that non-composition is telling you something and forcing you to make choices. One choice is to build a new kind of composition (monad transformer composition) which does work the way we want by being more sensitive to ordering.<p>Fifth, and finally, all the above is not to say that there&#x27;s any lack of merit to using delcont for effects. It&#x27;s a great technique. It may fit the &quot;algorithmic mind&quot; better, too.<p>I am trying to say, however, that it&#x27;s not some grand trick that frees the user from thinking about monads. You still are, you just trade one set of implementation concerns for another. But since things are still monads then the same <i>mathematical</i> techniques will translate. Which is a great thing—it means there are more tools to think about, understand, and become confident in the application of this technique.",1441496090

Japan might not have become an ally of the US, might not have been part of the gigantic US economic motor in the post-war era that heavily relied on Europe and Japan as (economic) allies, and Japan may have ended up as some kind of North/South Korean divide but between the US/USSR instead of US/China.<p>The theory goes then, that the nuclear bomb hastened the process to swiftly force a Japanese surrender before the USSR could exercise its influence in the region.<p>As such under this theory, the nuclear bomb is seen as the beginning of the cold war, which is normally recognised to have begun two years later. The bomb ensured the US its first major exclusive ally, Japan, in the cold war.<p>I haven&#x27;t studied it but it seems like a credible theory in that it&#x27;s plausible. Whether this plausible type of reasoning actually played a role in the bombings is another story, one I haven&#x27;t ever taken the time to explore.<p>In contrast, the notion that the USSR&#x27;s declaration of war made the Japanese surrender strikes me as implausible. After all, the Japanese had been viciously decimated for many months, the nuclear bombs were dwarfed by the firebombings campaigns of all major cities over and over again, and it was well known that the Japanese&#x27;s military capacity was reduced to virtually nothing, and that as a country with few natural resources and reliant on imports, it was bleeding dry after every single one of its logistics routes (air, land, sea) were completely cut off. Finally it had no air supremacy left and was defenceless to bombing. My point is, victory was impossible and defeat inevitably, the USSR declaration changed very little from the Japanese perspective. But it changed a lot for the American perspective, which is why it&#x27;s plausible the US wanted to force surrender quickly.<p>Beyond that, the cold war was very much, perhaps most powerfully characterised, by constant shows of power. Demonstrating nuclear power as the first nation must have played a role in the US&#x27;s claim to hegemony. Any doubts there may have been that the era of European supremacy was over, and that the US had become the world&#x27;s superpower, must have instantly faded. It&#x27;s the equivalent of China overtaking the US in GDP, building a base on mars, dominating at the olympics and showing unprecedented military power and weaponry. In that sense, too, a show of power with the bomb was perhaps the first action of the cold war.",1441495044

Men typically are standing around the water cooler talking about things like the larger ramifications of a society of androids, or silly masculine things like who would win a fight between a Klingon and a Vulcan. Whereas woman want to know if the androids have families, and how the Klingon <i>feels</i> after being defeated by a pinch. As much as modern PC sensibilities want to whitewash the facts, women and men are different. TOS was created for a male audience.

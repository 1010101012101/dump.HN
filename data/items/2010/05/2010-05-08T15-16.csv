Presumptuous?  ...possibly, I am not here to pass judgement but if the same were to happen to me then I would donate it without a blink.  Also I feel that natural disasters, while the majority are localized, do not belong to the nation of their happening - they belong to all of us.  We are all on Spaceship Earth and we are all humans.  When I peronally give donations I do not consider it an 'imposition', so why should campaigning others to follow suit be considered as such?

Sometimes, this can be handled by writing a simple tool or file format for code generation, as opposed to using a new language.  Make sure perl and python are both in your toolbox.<p>While it's useful to spend <i>some</i> time looking for existing solutions, don't be afraid to build things.  Your version will often be good enough, and quicker to integrate than a 3rd party solution.

I currently use either iGoogle (as it has lots of widgets which I can quickly use - e.g. GPS phone locator) or chrome default homepage (I like the big icons showing what the page actually looks like rather than a websites logo - helps you find the site faster).<p>I will usually only use the homepage when I first open the browser, as after that I can click bookmarks. I want the homepage to probably have a few rss feeds and some big buttons to click on and go to a new site.<p>Specific to your site:
I wont ever use the video, games, photos, music tabs - and would like the choices to remove those tabs. My homepage must have no information that I do not need. I want it to be more streamlined and slick than a skinned rabbit covered in grease.
I didnt want most of the default links on the web tab - and removing them individually was a pain as it took so long
There is a bit too much space at the top of the page. the distance between the top bar and the search bar and the ""tabs"" bar should be decreased imo.
""Feedback"" on bottom of page is misspelt :)<p>So currently I would choose iGoogle. But I would try it for a while if there were choices on icon sizes, rss feeds, and a few optional widgets e.g. calculators, and there are options to hide all features which I dont want to see in settings.",1273334196

I think this would be a fun way for hackers who are already friends to kill a weekend--kind of like Apple's insomnia contests for film students but for coders.

IIRC, DOS 6.2's Edit could handle large files; it accomplished this with a partial-loading/paging trick, rather than actually loading the entire file in memory.<p>So yes, I would like to and have enjoyed opening files of large size.

1) Simplicity.

Over time, organization set into religion and people began anthropomorphizing the gods.<p>Judaism moved ""categories of things we don't know"" from a multiple choice to a single entity. Then organization set in again with the anthropomorphizing.<p>It's a mistake to take this to zero -- the assumption that we know everything and things we cannot prove are not worthy of consideration. Having a deep understanding of the huge amount of unknown in the universe is a critical part of a balanced life.

6949866,comment,6949474,6949775,2,0,yajoe,,,"Agree on needing comments.<p>My C++ is a bit rusty, but I think the code is in fact checking if the number is divisible by 2 (i.e. n % 2 == 0).<p>I think it&#x27;s using the bitwise and operator (single &) to AND each bit in n and (n-1) and then checking if the least significant bit is 1 or 0.  The code would need to shift (<< or >>) to check if the number were a power of 2.<p>I thought there was another bitwise NOT operator, not the !, but I think, and this is the part I&#x27;m hazy on after getting home, that the ! applied to an int is intended to flip each bit.  Here&#x27;s why:<p>------------<p>n = 6 = 110<p>n-1 = 5 = 101<p>n & (n-1) = 110 & 101 = 100<p>!(110) = 001 => true<p>------------<p>n = 5 = 101<p>n-1 = 100<p>n & (n-1) = 101 & 100 = 101<p>!(101) = 010 => false only if the least significant bit is used for logic decisions... this seems non-portable for some reason, just like using the ! as a bitwise NOT.  It may actually be that ! only looks at the least significant bit, but I can&#x27;t find c++ docs to say one way or another.<p>Whatever the code actually does, this is exactly the kind of example to use as a poster child for adding just a few comments.",1387704973

If you care to understand or to convince me, look at my hypothetical Jewish thread analogy from last post and explain why it is either a) not offensive/illogical, or b) is not a fair analogy to the thread here.

Further, the situation is embarrassing for the authorities because they negotiated massive electricity price rises on the basis of needing large infrastructure improvements to handle future load. These price rises have been very politically sensitive as they are asserted to be part of the cost of the &quot;carbon tax&quot;. It is now clear there&#x27;s no need for even a fraction of the infrastructure they&#x27;re building, and one consequence has been that there&#x27;s been a rapid scaling back of solar subsidies to try and make all parties look a bit less foolish.<p>I think the moral of the story is that people are way more enthusiastic about installing this kind of thing than rational analysis would estimate.",1387704116

10734651,comment,10728698,10728698,0,0,iofj,,,"This is not true at all. The correct way of stating matters would be :<p>If Apple paid out all of it&#x27;s $181B to shareholders, it would owe $ about half the claimed amount in US taxes. Apple however has not made this decision not to pay out to shareholders, and it would be extremely impractical to attempt to force it.<p>Note that Apple hasn&#x27;t actually paid out this money to shareholders, so it probably will do so at some point in the future, and still pay these taxes.  These taxes are deferred, not &quot;avoided&quot;. It&#x27;s just doing so at a slower rate (and probably waiting until negotiations with the IRS yield a better deal)<p>If it was outlawed to hold this tax overseas, Apple would still not pay it out to shareholders. Instead it would simply invest it, in overseas real estate, overseas data centers, overseas financial holdings or whatever. It seems to me very unlikely that it would make a different decision (not pay out vs. pay out) simply because the US govt. would try to force them.<p>Or worse, Apple would do what companies did before WWII. Never pay out profits. Instead have a deal that roughly amounts to this : &quot;if you have $xx of apple stock, you get a director position within Apple, which comes with an expense account, free disneyworld access, a yacht, ...&quot; and never pay out anything (and then have 10 tiers of this deal ...).

Yes, 100 years ago. So why regulate them beyond the existing regulations now? A better question is &quot;What changed?&quot;<p>Anyone who owns a quad copter of the type they show on various stories about this, knows they are a pain in the ass to fly in high wind environments. Even with 9DOF IMU assisted station keeping a stiff wind will blow them around.<p>So why now? Why haven&#x27;t people complained about 1:10 scale jets they fly around at RC plane meetups? Those things are fast and can fly straight through a gust of wind.<p>This program isn&#x27;t about &quot;danger to aircraft&quot;, this program is entirely about identifying the owner of a R/C model and being able to jail/fine people who don&#x27;t agree to link their model to their identity. That ownership link is essential in prosecuting the right person when their model photographs something that someone else doesn&#x27;t want photographed, whether it is a celebrity sunbathing topless in their back yard or police officers beating down protestors. Its about identifying the owner of one of these devices when they are used in the commission of a crime, whether it is unlicensed surveillance or simple burglary. Its about identifying the owner of the R/C model that just crashed into your sports car and scratched the paint.<p>None if the prosecutions can be cost effective if the perpetrator can argue that it is plausibly not their R/C model. And having hundreds of identical models sold? Sure anyone could have been flying that particular unit as it buzzed your beach house.<p>This program is about tying people&#x27;s identities to the R/C models they operate so that they can be prosecuted when they do something that someone else doesn&#x27;t like with them. It is couched in terms of &quot;safety of aircraft&quot; because that is a narrative that the general public can get their head around, however the risk to aircraft is already &quot;priced into&quot; the existing regulations.",1450133896

Particularly, it is pretty disturbing to me that they require a government-issued ID to open an account even though their form says that an ID is not required unless one plans to write checks there.<p>I know this is not looking like a well-formulated write-up but I am trying to understand if anyone else is concerned about this data collection, particularly if there is a breach. The way I see it, they keep your ID information, address, date of birth, another picture that they put on your ID, along with your shopping habits and history. If there was ever a breach, the data thieves in question would acquire a rich mine of information that might enable them to pass a credit check if they also had your SSN.<p>You can say that Amazon collects information. True, but they are intrinsically limited. You can create multiple accounts there and never have to give them ID or date of birth, etc. Further, you can close your account.<p>Costco seems to be very interested in tracking each individual consumer very precisely. I say this because when I questioned their information requests, they said that it is to ensure that I don&#x27;t have any existing accounts with them since they don&#x27;t like &quot;clutter&quot; in their system (stated as such by the counter manager.)<p>I know I have a choice to not shop there but I just found it immensely curious how obsessed they are with tracking individuals. The closest analogy I can think of is Facebook and Google&#x27;s respective &quot;real name&quot; policies, which are hardly impregnable.<p>Anyways, I guess I am wondering if anyone else has had similar concerns and has interesting theories on the matter.",1450133771

And nothing can be boiled satisfactorily down to an Excel model.<p>Disagree: But you still have to do it. For <i>yourselves</i>, if not for VCs. Presumably, VCs want to see that you&#x27;ve thought long and hard about the market opportunity, about the competition, and about your marketing plan and business model. And you should have. Your market sizing will never be pitch-perfect, but you can&#x27;t just wave your hands in an investor meeting and declare that the entire exercise is bunk.<p>I would argue that, if you&#x27;re being asked to &quot;dig deeper&quot; into market sizing, or even if you&#x27;re being questioned <i>at all</i> about the market size in your meetings, it&#x27;s really a proxy question for something else. Maybe they find the idea narrow, and they want to be convinced it can broaden to other segments. Maybe they think you&#x27;re being insufficiently ambitious. Maybe it&#x27;s the opposite; they think you&#x27;re being wildly naive. Whatever the case, &quot;What&#x27;s the size of this market?&quot; is a question their analysts can probably guesstimate in a few days&#x27; worth of Excel monkeying.

Lighting is something people think they universally understand -- if it doesn&#x27;t work when they expect it to, they call.  In the rest of the &quot;lighting world&quot;, people expect the lamp won&#x27;t have problems working with whatever switch they plug it into.  I <i>still</i> hear people confused about CFLs that don&#x27;t work with their dimmers.<p>2.  The large enough part of the market that they control might be large when that market is limited to &quot;extremely early adopters of this kind of brand-new technology&quot;.  The market will grow in many stages over the next few years and this is <i>way</i> to early to start giving people <i>another</i> reason to avoid your products.<p><i>I&#x27;m</i> usually an early adopter of technologies like this, however, I&#x27;ve held off because there were only a handful of implementations out there and the use cases for them was still a &quot;that&#x27;d be neat, but not worth the money&quot;.  I&#x27;ve recently become <i>very</i> interested and will be buying something in the next 6-months, though this is making me reconsider that now.<p>I <i>know</i> I&#x27;m a future customer of this segment of technology -- not just lighting but upgrading my existing home automation system -- and I&#x27;m starting with lighting.  I&#x27;m not, yet, a customer because I haven&#x27;t found a good mix of &quot;good product&quot;, &quot;good interoperability&quot;, yet.  So they&#x27;ve gained lock-in of all of their early adopters -- a very short-term investment[1] -- and caused the second wave of (in this case, also) early adopters to look elsewhere.  They&#x27;re nowhere close to the market that even high-end, non-smart bulbs command and they won&#x27;t see much of it this way.  People complain today about having to buy special bulbs for their dimmer switches; this is a whole other level -- you can&#x27;t even <i>use</i> the lamp you just bought.  No way someone like my dad is going to be a customer.<p>I can see how this might improve sales in the <i>very</i> short-term.  It also might not.  It will increase support calls.  It will hurt their ability to get future customers and might even delay the next wave of adoption as people wait for fear of buying something that will become obsolete.  These are all the things <i>I&#x27;m</i> thinking about as a person who really <i>wants</i> this technology, has the money to buy it, but doesn&#x27;t have the money to do it twice.  And I can live without it for a bit longer.<p>[1] Short-term because the people who are buying these for the most part have a lot of disposable income or a very small deployment, so switching to something else isn&#x27;t necessarily as much of a lock-in as they&#x27;d like.  And this product in particular, the primary consumer is tech folks -- they&#x27;ll hack together the interoperability eventually, defeating the purpose.",1450133555

That one sentence told me more about what your system <i>actually does</i> than the home page, features page, and a few other areas I scanned combined. Following it with more specific information about how your system can be used and what concrete benefits it offers over what I&#x27;m probably doing instead today seems like a good idea.<p>From the pages I read before, I get that you have a tool that wants to be developer-friendly and fully buzzword-compliant. Of course, so does every other online service whose web site I visit. Unfortunately, aside from being something about e-mail, contacts and calendars, there is <i>literally nothing</i> on the pages I saw that tells me what your particular service is for or why I might want it, which is kind of a dead end.<p>Another point you might like to consider is that your docs repeatedly talk about things like integrating with some e-mail related service. However, &quot;integration&quot; is an empty word here. The back end code for various projects I work with already sends transactional mails via some service provider&#x27;s mail servers just fine with the usual one-liners. It probably already integrates just fine with some well-known mailing list management services for larger-scale communications, too, again with close to one-liners. So we come back to what does the integration your service offers <i>actually do</i> with mail and calendars and contacts? Systematically process incoming mail? Manage a mailing list? Send lifecycle mails when someone new signs up? IMHO, something needs to say, very clearly and very early, what your USP is.",1450133088

At first it seems to just focus on how the popular physics class explanation of why the bridge collapsed was wrong...which is mildly interesting but I was hoping from the title that we&#x27;d get an indepth look at the engineering processes behind the bridge -- as I remember hearing far more about the bridge in my engineering classes than in physics. But the OP delivers some about the engineering, though I&#x27;m largely ignorant of the details about the Tacoma Narrows Bridge (based on the film footage, I had assumed it had happened in the 60s, because I didn&#x27;t think color footage would have been easy to take in the early 40s).<p>I liked this detail a third-way through:<p>> <i>To be fair to Moisseiff and his engineers, the phenomenon of aerodynamic instability wasn&#x27;t well understood at the time. But it wasn&#x27;t completely unknown either. The last collapse of a suspension bridge due to its reaction to the wind occurred five decades earlier, when the Niagara-Clifton Bridge fell in 1889. (The heavyset design of the Brooklyn Bridge, which opened five years earlier, in 1883, was meant to withstand the sorts of forces that had affected suspension bridges in previous decades.)</i><p>> <i>Just four months after Galloping Gertie collapsed, a professor of civil engineering at Columbia University, J. K. Finch, summarized suspension bridge failures in an article in Engineering News Record. &quot;These long-forgotten difficulties with early suspension bridges, clearly show that while to modern engineers, the gyrations of the Tacoma bridge constituted something entirely new and strange, they were not new—they had simply been forgotten.&quot;</i><p>The most recent example of a similar failure was 50 years earlier. No doubt the information would propagate to some degree through engineering libraries...but given how much we today forget about engineering failures and case studies (in the software engineering context, some would argue that the memory hole cycle seems to be about 6 months long) despite vastly improved information pipelines, I&#x27;ve always wondered how difficult it was to learn and maintain best practices in the engineering disciplines before the past few decades.",1450132187

I&#x27;m taking an empirical route where I reference techniques that were applied to many real-world projects with lessons learned in papers or studies that were consistent. All one can do with limited data & these aren&#x27;t in order of importance.<p>1. Formal, non-English (eg math/logical) specifications of requirements or abstract design. English is ambiguous and misreadings of it caused countless errors, even back then. CompSci researchers tried formal specs with both English as a start and precise notations (eg Z, VDM, ASM&#x27;s, statecharts) for clarity in specifics. Result was many inconsistencies caught in highly assured systems and protocol specs before coding even began.<p>2. High assurance stuff often used mathematical (formal) verification. Whether that worked or made sense was hit and miss. More on it later. Yet, virtually all of them said there was benefit in restrictions on the specs, design, and coding style to fit the provers&#x27; limitations. Essentially, they used boring constructs that were easy to analyse and this prevented/caught problems. Don&#x27;t be too clever with design or code. Wirth and Hansen applied this to language design to bake safety & comprehension in with minimal to low loss in performance.<p>Note: Led to Nick P&#x27;s Law of Trustworthy Systems: &quot;Tried and true beats novel or new.&quot; Always the default.<p>3. Dijkstra&#x27;s THE project showed that modular, layered design with careful attention to interfaces (and interface checks) makes for most robust and maintainable software. Later results confirmed this where each module must fit in your head and control graph that&#x27;s pretty predictable with minimal cycles prevented all kinds of local-becomes-global issues. Many systems flawless (or nearly so) in production were built this way. Dijkstra correctly noted that it was <i>very hard</i> to do this even for smart people and average developer might screw structuring up a lot. Solid prediction... but still worth striving for improvement here.<p>4. Fagan ran empirical studies at IBM that showed a regular, systematic, code review process caught many problems, even what tests missed. Turned that into formal inspections with the periodicity and prioritizing tuned per organization for right cost-benefit. Was generalized to whole SDLC by others in high robustness areas. Improved every project that used it from then on. Exactly what parameters to use is still open-ended but periodically looking for well-known flaws with reference sheet always works.<p>5. Testing for every feature, code-path, prior issues outside of code base, and common use-case. All of these have shown repeated benefits. There&#x27;s a cut-off point for each that&#x27;s still an open, research problem. However, at a minimum, usage-based testing and regression testing helped many projects achieve either zero or near-zero, <i>user-facing</i> defects in production. That&#x27;s a very important differentiator as 100 bugs user never experiences is better than 5 that they do regularly. Mills&#x27; Cleanroom process combined simple implementation, code review, and usage-testing for insanely-high, statistically-certifiable quality even for amateur teams.<p>6. By around 60&#x27;s-70&#x27;s, it became clear that the language you choose has a significant effect on productivity, defects, maintenance, and integration. Numerous studies were run in industry and military comparing various ones. Certain languages (eg Ada) showed vastly lower defects, equal/better productivity, and great maintenance/integration in every study. Haven&#x27;t seen many such studies since the 90&#x27;s and most aren&#x27;t constructed well to eliminate bias. However, it&#x27;s grounded in science to claim that certain language choices prevent common negatives and encourage positives. So, it follows to adopt languages that make robust development easier.<p>7. By the 80&#x27;s or 90&#x27;s, it was clear that computers were better at finding certain problems in specs and code than humans. This gave rise to methodologies that put models of system or code into model-checkers and provers to show certain properties always hold (the good) or never show up (the bad). Used successfully with high-assurance safety and security critical systems with results ranging from &quot;somewhat beneficial&quot; to &quot;caught stuff we&#x27;d never see or test for.&quot; Back then it was unclear how applicable it was. Recent work by Chlipala, Leroy, et al show near perfect results in practice when specs/proofs are right and much wider application than before. Lots of tooling and prior examples means this is a proven way of getting extra quality <i>where high-stakes are worth the cost</i> and where core functionality doesn&#x27;t change often.. The CompCert C compiler, Eiffel&#x27;s SCOOP concurrency scheme, and Navy team&#x27;s EAL7 IPsec VPN are good examples.<p>8. Static analysis, aka &quot;lightweight formal methods,&quot; were devised to deal with specialized skills and labor of above. Getting to the point, tools like Astree Analyzer or SPARK Ada can prove absence of common flaws with little to no false positives without need for mathematicians in the company. Just a half dozen of these tools by themselves found tons of vulnerabilities in real-world software that passed human review and testing. Enough said, eh?<p>9. Software that succeeded with testing often failed when random stuff came at it, especially malware. This led to various fault-injection methods like fuzz testing to simulate that and find breaking points. The huge number of defects, esp in file formats & protocol engines, found via this method argues for its effectiveness in improving quality. It ties in with stuff above in that well-written code that validates input at interface and preserves invariants throughout execution should simply disregard (or report) such erroneous input.<p>10. Interface errors themselves posed something like 80+% of problems. This was noted as far back as the 60&#x27;s in Apollo project when Margaret Hamilton invented software engineering, fault-tolerance, and specification techniques to fight it. Dijkstra and Hoare pushed for pre- and post-conditions plus specific invariants to document the assumptions of code during procedure calls. Modern version is called Design by Contract in Eiffel, Ada, and numerous other languages (even asserts in C). Many deployments and tests showed such interface checks caught many issues, esp assumption violations when new code extended or modified legacy.<p>11. Concurrency issues caused all kinds of problems. Techniques were devised by Hansen (Concurrent Pascal) and later Meyer et al (SCOOP) to mostly immunize against them at language level with acceptable performance. Languages without that, especially Java, later got brilliant tooling that could reliably find race conditions, deadlocks, or livelocks. Use of any method inevitably found problems in production code that had escaped detection. So, using prior, proven methods to immunize against or detect common errors in concurrency is A Good Thing. Note that shared-nothing, event-driven architectures also emerged but I have less data on them outside that some (NonStop, Erlang) worked extremely well.<p>The above are just a few things that computer science established with supporting evidence from real-world projects so long ago that Windows didn&#x27;t exist. Anyone applying these lessons got benefits in terms of code quality, security, and maintainability. The rare few applying most or all of them, mainly high assurance community, got results along lines of space shuttle control code with extremely, low defects or zero in production. So, given the past and present <i>results</i> of these methods every time they&#x27;re put to the test, I&#x27;m irritated every time another person talks like there&#x27;s no good science to quality software. I just listed a bunch of it, it&#x27;s been tested in production as scientific method requires thousands of time, tweaked probably hundreds, and core approaches remained even if tactics got modified.<p>Now people can feel free to use and improve on the science. CompSci continues to in every area I listed with a chunk of proprietary and FOSS developers using a subset of the techniques. Just need more uptake. Use what&#x27;s proven. And do note that there&#x27;s plenty of examples for specific design and implementation decisions for common types of functionality. Many things that were shown to work or not work that could be encoded in libraries, DSL&#x27;s, templates, whatever. No excuse except for our field&#x27;s continual failure to learn and hand down the lessons from the past.",1450132091

10734428,comment,10731586,10733848,0,0,paulmd,,,"Models (non-FPV) are typically flown until they deplete their power supply, which happens rapidly.  For small electric models this is usually 6-8 minutes.  Larger electric models and gas (usually nitromethane) models can sometimes stay up for 15 minutes or more, depending on how hard you&#x27;re hitting the power.<p>Gas models use a separate battery pack for running the receiver and servos.  Electric models usually use the same pack (via &quot;battery eliminator circuit&quot;), but there&#x27;s a low-voltage cutoff that cuts the motor power off while there&#x27;s still enough power to run the electronics.  There&#x27;s typically a &quot;soft-cutoff&quot; feature that allows you to restart the motors if you need power to land - you get maybe a 10 second burst of low power or 5 seconds at medium power before the cutoff trips again.  It can help to stretch out an approach if you&#x27;re downwind and not going to make the field.<p>Either way there is no technical problem with making a power-off landing.  Such &quot;deadstick&quot; landings are very standard in the RC world, and most fields will want to see trainee pilots make several of them on a &quot;buddy box&quot; system under the control of an instructor before they will approve you to fly alone.  They&#x27;re no big deal <i>as long as</i> you&#x27;re being responsible with where you&#x27;re flying.<p>Radio range is essentially &quot;as far as you have a line-of-sight&quot;.  Typical radios will have a range of 1.5-3 miles but you&#x27;ll lose visual on the aircraft at a fraction of that distance.  Some micro-sized parkflyer aircraft have less sensitive receivers, but since they&#x27;re smaller you&#x27;ll lose visual at shorter ranges too.  Some radios have longer range, particularly amateur radio operators who can operate with greater transmitter power.  These are popular with the FPV crowd, but to operate on these bands you must have your callsign and address on the plane.<p>The long range can actually be a bit of a problem because the signals really will go quite far, and can result in intermittent loss of control if someone else is operating on that frequency.  AMA-licensed fields have a pinboard (if you don&#x27;t have the clothespin with your frequency on it, you can&#x27;t turn your radio on), and the fields are spaced out far enough to avoid this (typically a minimum of 5 miles).  You&#x27;re supposed to check before you just go fly somewhere, but some people don&#x27;t.  2.4 GHz spread-spectrum radios are getting very popular nowadays because they&#x27;re largely immune to these radio hits.",1450131713

In the article you cited, for example, Chad Austin mentions GOAL, which was what we used for the Crash Bandicoot games. That worked well because it was domain-specific and because the rest of the code was all highly-optimized C and hand-coded assembly (the latter mostly by me, in fact). And it allowed us to pack the (tiny) code for the critters in data pages that were very, very precious (the PS1 only had 2MB of RAM).<p>However, x86 assembly, at least, is pretty big, and -- as you point out -- Python instructions are quite high level so you need far fewer of them to do anything. In practice, .pyo files really are generally pretty compact. I&#x27;m not sure how it compares to ARM, which has a less crazy instruction set. But I&#x27;m very skeptical on the code size claims. It &quot;feels&quot; like Python code is much smaller, but that said I haven&#x27;t done a real experiment.<p>Regarding startup times, you do have to be careful about imports and regexes: it&#x27;s easy to write code where importing a module results in a ton of additional imports you don&#x27;t really need yet, and regex compiles that are better deferred. But in any case, the big driver of startup times now isn&#x27;t Python -- it&#x27;s paging in and decrypting the database pages required to construct the first inbox view. That&#x27;s all done by SQLite, so Python&#x27;s largely irrelevant to the startup time these days.<p>I&#x27;m not sure how things come down with respect to memory footprint, but we fit comfortably even on a lowly iPhone 4, so I think it&#x27;s becoming less of a practical issue.<p>The huge win for me personally using Python has been that it is extremely easy to come back to code I wrote several years ago (or that someone else wrote) and immediately understand it. For such a nasty domain as email, this really helps <i>a lot</i>. Anecdotally, I&#x27;ve been coding in C dialects since 1979 and I still haven&#x27;t got the same ability to understand old C code as I do old Python code. For context, virtually all the code I wrote at ITA was C and C++, and Inky is the first &quot;real&quot; thing I&#x27;ve used Python for. It really is a nice language, despite having (in CPython, at least) some frustrating warts (and the whole Py2 vs Py3 issue).<p>Finally, it&#x27;s worth pointing out that we do use C for the most heavyweight things (embedded database, TLS/crypto, parsing, image format conversion, etc.) So we&#x27;re probably not typical of either a C or a Python app, really.",1450131527

Commercial operators should <i>always</i> be subject to some degree of regulation and oversight. Hobbyist operators who <i>are</i> a member of a model aircraft club (or were a member in good standing for $A_WHILE in the past) are obligated to follow FAA, AMA, and club guidelines and are liable for violations of FAA general regulations regarding interactions between model and full-scale aircraft, but are not required to register themselves or their craft with the FAA. Hobbyist operators who aren&#x27;t and have <i>never been</i> associated with a club?

I was trying to start up a company doing voluptuously sculpted telephones, when the guy who was helping me with that saw my 3dSkiMaps and thought it might have a better chance of flying than the phones. I've worked on various configurations over the years, and finally hit on something I felt I should go public with late in 2006.

74279,comment,74257,74267,0,0,Prabaker,,,"I don't think Facebook has had a good image recently, e.g. over valuation has made them a mockery; privacy concerns relating to the disclosure of personnel information to third parties; the fact that they don't actually delete your profile when you leave and Facebook personnel willfully looking at peoples profiles for entertainment. I feel a backlash coming on already.<p>Also, most of my profile is made up anyway. I have put cereals as one of my interests; I can't wait to receive 'contextual' cereal ads!",1193766114

74276,comment,74174,74176,0,0,ivankirigin,,,"Escape velocity is a powerful idea. Live long enough to live forever. <p>If you were born in 1945, living to 2027 is very likely. In 20 years, do you really think life expectancy will be stuck at 82? My dad was born in 1946 and most of his elders lived beyond 86. My reasonable assumption is that he will live to 100. My optimistic assumption is that 40 years from now, he will have access to much better technology, and will live well beyond 100.<p>One big reason to have confidence in this is that there are trillions of dollars backing the boomers' goals. As they age, people will take the ""cure aging"" movement more seriously. ",1193765907

Is it just that we have a collection of plain text links at the bottom of the page? Would adding some more content or more text describing the site help give it a more valid look?",1193764914

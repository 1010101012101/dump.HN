Things are so bad with infrastructure stability, I could not believe they had functioning internet during routine bombardment and military operations, especially enough for startups.<p>Very interesting article, but I have one pet peeve.  The word is halas, it is routinely translated khalas or 5alas (from خلاص).  I have studied Arabic now approaching ten years, and I have never seen this mistake before.<p>What is funny is that, when mocking expats and foreigners trying to integrate culturally and linguistically in Arab cities (I was a target of this of course), this is like always the first word (then maashi, ok, then in shaa allah, God willing) every expat who spends time in the MENA region sprinkles into their speech.  Almost always is it used in the incorrect context, with moronically extreme overuse.<p>The journalist could have easily Googled this: halas tells you nothing on Google, while the first result for me for khalas is Yahoo Answers, where someone asks how to use that word.",1412323112

An explanation is she&#x27;s in Electrical Engineering - my ugrad experience of EE was a emphasis on <i>using</i> tools (formula etc) as opposed to understanding them (that&#x27;s for Science). Engineers, after all, are paid to get stuff done, not just sit there and grok it. &quot;Fluency&quot; with tools works well for EE.<p>OTOH, all discplines have &quot;tools&quot; - even pure maths has algebraic manipulation. If you&#x27;re not fluent, it will slow you down (fortunately, you&#x27;ll have years of algebraic practice from school).<p>OAH, most professional mathematicians don&#x27;t <i>think</i> symbolically (a survey found, IIRC, about 70% visual, 25% kinesthetic, 5% linguistic) - notation not so much a tool of thought as a serial representation (serialization/data format), for recording/communicating. So practice in thinking is what&#x27;s helpful.<p>I think fluency with &quot;standard&quot; modes of thought is a double-edged sword. Yes, you become expert with those tools, fast and able. But that very expertise biases your perception and reasoning in terms of them. Thus, it&#x27;s hard for you to see another way; you&#x27;ll tend to build on top of them instead. Fortunately, since our tools are pretty good, this approach works well.

If you finish Realschule you can still get an education at a company for a skilled job and afterwards go get your Abitur (to be able to go to college) at an evening school or something.<p>The early separation isn&#x27;t the greatest thing (although there have also been people switching, or a friend of mine who changed from Gymnasium to Realschule and after 10th grade when Realschule finished he continued on the Gym and actually got his Abitur), but I actually think it helps because different students can learn at different levels and speeds.<p>Your criticism stands, though, and more recent attempts to reform the school system have introduced &quot;Gesamtschulen&quot;, where all students learn together in one school, but pick different courses at different levels. The results are mixed (not as easy as black+white), but AFAIK not that bad.",1412320473

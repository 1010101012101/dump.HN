20110,comment,20108,20108,0,0,reitzensteinm,,,"I really can't stress how highly I reccommend this interview if you are interested in the finance industry. John founded the first index fund after noticing that the stock market invariably outperforms managed funds after fees are taken out. The same is true today, and the Vanguard group manages around 750 billion dollars with fees around 0.2% (an order of magnitude less than average managed fund fees). Truly inspiring guy.<p>I couldn't help but wondering after listening to it whether there could be potential for a startup here. It would require a lot of connections in the finance industry and a significant amount of capital, but there's a clear path to profitability and only two real metrics - getting people to trust you (require some kind of insurance?) and keeping costs low. Just how cheap could you make something that maintains an index portfolio?<p>My other thought was maybe he could offer 'fund x + 0.2%' packages - something that tracks the performance of a specific managed fund, after fees, and tacks on a bonus 0.2%. That would be a cool hack that in the long term you could make a significant amount of money from, but there's always the potential that a fund will do exceptionally well in the short term. Food for thought anyway.",1178516988

20100,comment,20012,20012,0,0,jey,,,"Is it really that they ""run out of steam"" before finishing their projects? It seems to me that they finish all the interesting problems of the original project and are distracted by an even grander problem that still has unsolved problems. The original project's interesting problems have usually been solved and all that remains is mundane crap.<p>I also think the extended periods of melancholy are avoidable. After all, the BBM is melancholic because the real world he has to deal with is phony and filled with bullshit, not because he gets a kick out of wearing black lipstick and posting emo entries to LiveJournal. So what's the solution? Save him from the phony bullshit. Put him (or yourself) in an environment where he is stimulated and working on real problems without having to play society's idiotic games. Academia is my standard example of this.. there's just a lot of hoops to jump through to accomplish nothing, and the metric of GPA doesn't actually correlate to anything useful like ""knowledge acquired"" or ""mastery of the subject"", but instead reflects the amount of busy work done by the student. Learning is simply a happy side-effect that might happen while maximizing GPA. Even professors seem to spend a big chunk of their time just producing ""epsilon papers"" that contribute nothing other than an impression that the professor has been busy. </standard academia rant><p>Anyway, put the BBM in a suitable environment and they'll be melancholic less of the time. I think.",1178514855

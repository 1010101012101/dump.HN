The keypad / MIDI keyboard input method is definitely efficient once you&#x27;re good at it, but I would say it&#x27;s much harder to get used to than just drawing the notation.  Drawing a dotted quarter note is natural for anyone who has taken music theory.  Pressing 4 (or whatever) for quarter note, then &#x27;.&#x27; for dot, then pressing a key on a different keyboard for the pitch -- it&#x27;s just a pretty intricate set of steps to go through for something that would just be a few intuitive strokes of a pen.<p>2. A MIDI keyboard takes up noticeable space.  Even though I do a fair amount of Sibelius, I don&#x27;t have one in my music room -- I only have a real piano.  You also need to make sure your setup has the MIDI keyboard right next to your computer, which isn&#x27;t super convenient.<p>It&#x27;s true, I&#x27;m not a professional in the sense that you mean.

Steve rented the fanciest auditorium in San Francisco- Symphony Hall (though NeXT was just off the Stanford campus). No one had seen the NeXT computer yet.  Most PCs up until then were some kind of off-white plastic slabs. When the NeXT was unveiled it was a dark-gray magnesium cube. (The Borg were still three years in the future.) The presentation began in a darkened auditorium.  Then a computer screen started talking. It displayed something that looked like a Mac screen. PC multi-media was still crude then, so audience erupted at the high quality computer speech.  The speech said something about how the new NeXT woud supercede all previous PCs.  Then the light came on with NeXT cube unveiled and Steve launching into a product speech. Besides the high multimedia capabilities of the NeXT hardware, Steve also promoted the NeXTSTeP operating system and software-development kit. It was object-oriented top to bottom, pretty rare then, save for a few things at Xerox.  This was supposed to make writing educational applications a &quot;piece of cake&quot;.<p>The NeXT never really panned out at universities becasue it was expensive and slow.

I&#x27;m not really interested in that.  When I say &#x27;right&#x27; or &#x27;correct&#x27; in this context, it&#x27;s generally about not being blinkered by the current state of your codebase.  People get so used to the fact that their current codebase does things in a particular way, they often look at problems as situations where they have no choice but to force the problem into the frame of their code.  Solutions where you solve the problem with something closer to what you would want to write if you didn&#x27;t have to worry quite so much about the peculiarities of your current codebase generally scare people, but are often the better decision not just from some academic point of view, but literally from an execution, getting-things-done quickly point of view.  &#x27;correct&#x27; as I use it in this context is mainly a shorthand for that concept.<p>The whole point here is not to say that there&#x27;s some secret that avoids you from having to make decisions, it&#x27;s to say that many people in the real world are making a particular class of error in decision making. Signs that a particular decision might fall in that category include:<p>1. the main trade off being considered between the options is developer time<p>2. none of the developers actually think the believed-to-be-quicker-to-implement option is a good option apart from its supposed quickness to implement.<p>3. other options exist where a significant fraction of developers agree that apart from their supposed slowness to implement, they are good options.",1444250010

Pretty famous book. There were tons of Geometry. The kind of Geometry you could build temples for kings, find the shortest road or just show-off your math skills by proving that prime numbers are infinite(!).<p>Since the book was so famous and deemed <i>important</i>, the Farao tried to read the book. But it was a difficult book. He had to go back and forth more than twice. He was struggling to understand the first chapters. Eveything was so complicaed and soon he got bored to death. So being a Farao (a God among humans) summoned Euclid and asked if there was a shorter path to learning geometry than reading the book. Euclid turned to the royalty and replied: &quot;There is no royal road to geometry.&quot;<p>So, that&#x27;s the problem: There&#x27;s no royal road to programming. You have to put the in the hours and patience. If you&#x27;re really going to do this, stop pressing your self to learn <i>fast</i>.

I think I read it in some mimeographed computer newsletter the Stanford Math Library received which was a predecessor to Byte Magazine. Getting to SLAC by bicycle was nasty because it was up a challenging hill.<p>People demoed their projects there, often Rasberry-PI-type contraptions that did this and that.  I remember one group managed to get their hands on a cast-off mini-computer and would code it through front panel dip-switches to make music and light designs. A bare mini-computer in those days cost a couple of annual salaries.<p>Well the two Steves were demoing and almost-turnkey micro-computer board. You had to add a power supply, television and keyboard. And it was in a wooden case. Plastic computer cases were another year or two in the future. I thought a turnkey PC was boring. All the fun was soldering together your own contraption in my view then.<p>Several other groups were selling turnkey computer boards too. One was called CroMemCo named after a Stanford dorm. which they operated from.

Here is a short list of classic selling points for Perl 5 that Perl 6 clearly loses on.<p>1. Performance.  Back in the 1990s, Perl hit a sweet spot of being quick for development while still being fast enough for a wide variety of tasks.  It still performs reasonably well versus other scripting language.  Every time I looked at Perl 6 it failed to be fast enough for anything interesting to me.<p>2. Library support.  Any argument for Perl quickly lists CPAN.  It is a large part of why people adopted it in the first place.  Perl 6 loses to every major language, including Perl 5, on this.  If you need to do anything from connect to a database to sending email, Perl 6 loses.<p>3. Backwards compatibility.  Perl has a history of being careful with backwards compatibility, starting with Perl 1&#x27;s unit test suite back in the mid-80s.  (It would be decades until other language communities caught up.)  Most organizations currently using Perl 5 use it because they already have existing code in Perl 5.  Their primary motivation for staying on Perl is that they don&#x27;t want to rewrite their code.  Perl 6 requires a rewrite of their code.",1444248997

D1 and D2 were written for play on IPX/SPX LANs. <i>All</i> latency compensation was done <i>manually</i> by the player. It wasn&#x27;t until the IPX/SPX to TCP/IP bridges known as Khan and Kali came out that folks could play them on the Internet using their shitty analog modems. In fact, a pretty <i>big</i> part of Descent 3&#x27;s marketing was that it was optimized for play over a analog modem connection to the Internet. [0][1] (Source: I&#x27;ve -sadly- put <i>far</i> more hours into Descent 1 and 2 than probably <i>any</i> other video game. I could fly the first five or ten mines in both installments backwards, with rear-view off and not hit a wall. I also racked up <i>far</i> more in per-minute charges to my dial-up ISP than I <i>ever</i> want to think about.)<p>Edit: As I was thinking about this, I remembered that both D1 and D2 <i>also</i> offered null-modem (AKA crossover serial) and analog modem options for head-to-head multiplayer. Note that neither of these options transmit data over IP; the analog modem option just acted as a <i>really</i> long null-modem cable. ;) The analog modem option was likely added because once you&#x27;ve written the code to handle null-modem connections, you&#x27;re at <i>least</i> 90% of the way to handling analog modem connections. But -again-, latency compensation was <i>entirely</i> handled by the player.<p>> ...players report games becoming difficult around 100ms and nigh unplayable >=300ms...<p>Here&#x27;s the thing. If you have -for a little while- a > 300ms ping spike, it&#x27;s <i>going</i> to disrupt your play. If you <i>always</i> have a > 300ms ping, two things are true:<p>1) It&#x27;s the only way you&#x27;ve ever played, so your reaction times are going to tuned to that latency.<p>2) You&#x27;re never going to have any basis for comparison, so (and this is key) you&#x27;re not going to complain about your ping on forums.<p>> If someone is going to get bothered to the point of toxicity by ping, ... they&#x27;re going to get just as bothered being killed by Malzahar&#x27;s global ultimate, [etc.]<p>I generally agree with this. However, if one can easily remove two barriers to a player&#x27;s enjoyment and not substantially impact the game&#x27;s character or mechanics, why <i>shouldn&#x27;t</i> one do such a thing? The action obviously produces more happiness than it eliminates.<p>> It&#x27;s like instead of optimizing for players to be able to play their best and give them the tools to do so, they optimize for, and drag everyone else down to the level of the emotional child.<p>This is hyperbole. You <i>can&#x27;t</i> seriously believe that the removal of player level and ping information from the match loading screen is &quot;drag[ging] everyone else down to the level of the emotional child&quot;.<p>> I also don&#x27;t believe Riot is serious about dealing with the problem...<p>I played LoL for a looong time. I played before the Tribunal was even a thing. I can&#x27;t speak to <i>how</i> serious Riot is about improving the community, but the difference between the pre-Tribunal community and the community <i>today</i> is night and day. The improvement is <i>vast</i>, and has largely come through the steps that Riot has taken to remind folks that<p>* This is just a game.<p>* Your teammates are people, too.<p>* People who enjoy themselves are more likely to play well. People who play well win more often.<p>and through steps to identify and prevent chronically toxic players from interacting with non-toxic players. Maybe the isolation machinery doesn&#x27;t work quickly enough for your liking, but it <i>is</i> there, it <i>does</i> work, and it has had a <i>real</i>, positive effect on the character of the playerbase.<p>> ...banned people don&#x27;t buy champions and skins.<p>Non-toxic players who refuse to play the game because the playerbase is full of toxic players <i>also</i> don&#x27;t buy champs and skins, <i>and</i> they don&#x27;t introduce their friends to the game.

10348703,comment,10347492,10348026,0,0,careersuicide,,,"> is it reasonable to consider react when you just want to add some interactions and dynamism to a page that was rendered server side?<p>This is more or less what I&#x27;ve been using it for at work. My general &quot;rule&quot; is that if I&#x27;ve got a form and any other field or set of fields depends on what&#x27;s happening in another field or set of fields I try wrap both parts up into a React component (with as many subcomponents as necessary). I&#x27;m using react-rails[1] and creating custom form builder modules which I include in my main form builder class. The custom form builder methods just call react_component and pass in the form object as a property to the component so I get server-side rendering of the component and the same code gets reused client-side. Obviously it can be used for much more than dynamic forms, but for what I&#x27;m currently doing this is all I need.<p>> React seems kind of like an all-or-nothing approach. It seems like overkill if you just want to provide a little more structure to jQuery spaghetti code.<p>I&#x27;ve found that > 90% of my front-end bugs around forms involve fields that are somehow linked. Handling that with unstructured jQuery goes from easy to a horrible mess at a nearly exponential rate as the number of interacting parts increases linearly. React makes it really easy to keep track of state and have it flow downwards as properties to subcomponents. Obviously you can go way overboard with it and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for everything, but the ability to use it in just one troublesome spot and nowhere else if that&#x27;s all you need is really cool. It&#x27;s the opposite of all-or-nothing. I have a very large application that uses it in about a dozen tricky places like dynamic lists of things. The rest of the application is just plain old server-side rendered HTML.<p>1. <a href=""https://github.com/reactjs/react-rails"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/reactjs/react-rails</a>",1444248705

A term like that might sound cruel or dismissive, but I don&#x27;t care for the way that the cult of the amateur and the availability of very cheap technology has massively devalued the craft of professional photographers. This is part of a much longer historical trend in which the artistic/creative input to a piece of work is systematically undervalued and more is invested in marketing it than producing it.

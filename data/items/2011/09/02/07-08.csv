Many (really, many!) wealthy people I know or know through others are preparing for civil unrest.  From bankers in The City in London creating places in rural Montana to a billionaire who has built a ""bunker"" (his word -- although it's more a heavily-secured mansion) in Switzerland, it's definitely concerning them enough to ""insure"" against it.<p>I don't see how it <i>can't</i> get really ugly in the next five to ten years, including moments of martial law.

2953313,comment,2949790,2949790,1,0,jackkinsella,,,"SEEKING WORK (Freelance only)  London, UK<p>Im an Oxford graduate moving to London (from Ireland) in three weeks. I offer full stack web development using Ruby/Rails and help with online marketing (SEO, conversion optimisation, Adwords, Facebook advertising). As of this week I've written half of my first draft of a book on Rails best practices, and I will apply these vigorously in my work (unless it makes business sense not to).<p>I consider myself a Marketing-Driven-Developer because the majority of programming I do is intended to improve conversions.  Some recent examples:<p>-	A 15-step client management state machine, sending iteratively engineered emails to clients at key stages, the net result improving conversions nearly 400%.<p>-	Automatically generating arrays of keywords from data and using these to power Google Adwords campaigns.<p>-	AB-Testing design elements to improve conversions. Examples include internal remarketing pop-ups, advantages spiels, add to cart button placements (Top or bottom of the page? Both.), checkout button design (A big green buy now button lost to a grey and bland  checkout button. A surprising result, but thats exactly why you should be AB-Testing.).<p>-	Improving organic traffic three-fold by generating hundreds of unique pages using existing data and adding SEO keywords (determined through analytics data) to the URL, title, a H1 tag, the first P, a sidebar (in bold), the meta-description, and to internal links to that page elsewhere on the website . I also swear by sitemaps, which ought to be automatically generated on each build.<p>Ive studied works on advertising and influence and, if requested, I can offer some help with advertising copywriting. Briefly, I like to bombard users with long lists of advantages related to their core desires, use visually emotive vocabulary, then, once the users desire a product, apply influence techniques such as building trust by demonstrating social proof (testimonials, stories of other users, Facebook likes), and creating believable scarcity.<p>Work Samples:<p>www.oxbridgenotes.co.uk (I've worked mainly on this for the last year and a half) - A marketplace for students to buy and sell their notes online. I am the owner of the website and all development, design and copy is my own. I run an assortment of Adwords and Facebook advertising campaigns.<p>www.bolivianexpress.org - CMS on front, with a applicant management system behind the scenes for managing intern hires (Bolivian Express's business). Sole developer.<p>www.hiredhelp.ie - Directory for babysitters, housekeepers and so on. Lead developer.<p>www.westernlasserclinic.ie - I built the website (albeit with a nice ThemeForest template), and I edited the copy and run their Adwords campaign in the competitive laser eye surgery domain. According to the owner ""they've never been busier after my help, despite the recession.

If the government didn't bail out the banks in the first place, most of these banks would have been broken up and their assets sold off during bankruptcy. Many of those executives who made big bucks running their companies into the ground would have been out of a job.<p>You could even go one step back: if the government and its central bank didn't subsidize risk through low interest rates, incentives to lend to people who were massive credit risks, and so on, we may not have had the housing bubble - at least at that scale - to begin with.<p>Let's go back even further to the easy money .com bubble and the resulting collapse which ""excused"" the artificially low interest rates mentioned above...<p>Instead of focusing on more intervention, how about we argue for fixing the real problem: let the market work, end these artificial interest rates, and stop debasing the currency.",1314950016

2953305,comment,2952124,2953067,1,0,todsul,,,"Not <i>all</i> customer development, but the flavour we practiced, which mostly involved just asking people how/what/why they did what they did.<p>Imagine a scale that represents the strength of positive signals you get from data collected during customer development. At one extreme, you have weak signals from potential customers who just <i>say</i> they'll use your product. At the other extreme, you have strong signals from potential customers who <i>part with cold hard cash</i> and sign multi-year contracts (despite not having a product yet).<p>When we first tested our concept, we focussed on the following:<p><pre><code>  * Just doing customer development (it was a big step and an exciting new world)\n  * Building a big sample set (""if we're going to do it, let's do it right"")\n</code></pre>\nBut, in retrospect,<p><pre><code>  * We were oblivious to (the lack of) positive signal strength\n  * We too quickly dismissed negative signals as ""people outside our market""\n</code></pre>\nSo the intention was there, and man we worked hard at it, but the data was useless and our analysis was heavily biased. Sounds harsh to say it was <i>useless</i>, but it really was. We learned very little from talking to hundreds of people. Of course we learned how to better do customer development next time, which was/is invaluable.<p>I think when you ask people about their behaviour and whether they'd use your product, they're likely to err on the side of politeness. That's a serious problem for concept validation. But ask them for cash, and politeness takes a back seat.<p>Also, just asking if someone will <i>use your product</i> introduces bias already. It's a leading question.<p>You could instead ask the following:<p><pre><code>  * ""What are your top 5 interests?""\n  * If they mention your industry or niche, continue with...\n  * ""What are your top 5 problems relating to X-interest?""\n  * If they mention a problem your concept solves, then record a weak positive signal\n  * Describe your concept/solution/product... \n  * If they're willing to provide an email address, increase signal strength\n  * If they're willing to sign-up for a trial, increase...\n  * Pay deposit, increase... etc\n</code></pre>\nLong story short, I think signal strength and honest analysis is the key to validating a concept. It takes some real hustle to get financial commitments for non-existent products, but hey, that's what differentiates founders.",1314949863

2953255,comment,2951046,2952795,4,0,arete,,,"I really disliked Scala at first as well. It <i>is</i> a very complex language, partly due to the fancy type system, implicits, and syntactic sugar. Still, after a year of writing Scala code I've really come to like it. The complexity certainly comes with benefits, and I wouldn't call it ""obfuscated"" in the least.<p>That fancy type system goes a long way towards helping to verify, at compile time, that your program is correct. Plus, with dynamically-typed languages you often have to build your own halfassed adhoc type system to check function parameters, map objects to db tables, (de)serialize JSON data, etc. Much better to use a well-thought out one built into the language, that also finds errors before the code is running!<p>Here's a little real-world example of using Scala types to define the response from a Foursquare JSON API call:<p><pre><code>  case class Response[T](meta: Meta, response: T)\n  case class Meta(code: Int)\n\n  case class MayorshipsResponse(mayorships: Mayorships)\n  case class Mayorships(count: Int, items: List[Mayorship])\n  case class Mayorship(venue: Venue)\n</code></pre>\nIsn't the verification and documentation value of that so much better than using the typical dynamic language's map-of-maps and hoping you didn't mistype a string key name somewhere?<p>Implicits provide a really nice way to extend the functionality of existing types. Instead of monkey patching, which pollutes your entire program, you can simply write a wrapper class that provides new functionality and an implicit conversion. This is how Scala can give raw Java Arrays the same rich set of methods that any native Scala collection has, and how the standard ""map"" method can be defined generically but still build & return the expected result collection type.<p>Syntactic sugar is arguably a problem, there are definitely a lot of special cases to learn and remember: when can parenthesis be omitted, when can curly braces replace parenthesis, special methods with symbol names like ""::"", "":+"", ""@"", etc. But in the long run I think the sugar does make code easier to read.<p>Compare a single ""map"" function in Erlang (a language that really eschews syntactic sugar):<p><pre><code>  lists:map(fun(N) -> N + 1 end, [1, 2, 3]).\n</code></pre>\nvs Scala:<p><pre><code>  List(1, 2, 3).map(_ + 1)\n</code></pre>\nwhich is really just syntactic sugar for:<p><pre><code>  List(1, 2, 3).map({(n: Int) => n + 1})\n</code></pre>\nI think that in the long run I'd rather memorize some rules (as long as they're reasonable and logical) rather than have to read/write through a ton of boilerplate every time I declare a closure.",1314948398

There was no ""A tranche"", it was all a bunch of garbage tranches. As for the ""AAA"" rating, that's a rating assigned to the whole CDO by a rating agency such as Moody's or Standard & Poor's.<p>Toxic assets weren't always considered toxic. Some thought the bubble would last forever, some knew it would end but didn't know when & didn't want to miss out. Firms would get commissions for making or selling securities. Buyers of these securities made calculations that woefully underestimated mortage default rates & to make matters worse, borrowed money to buy these crap investments. Firms weren't required to keep the bad tranche of the CDOs either, they could rebundle all portions of CDOs into other CDOs(<a href=""http://www.propublica.org/article/banks-self-dealing-super-charged-financial-crisis/single"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.propublica.org/article/banks-self-dealing-super-c...</a>).

You're still stuck with your crappy merchandise & have to payback your debts. It's more complicated than that though when you get down to leveraging & the default swap daisy chains, essentially they all built a house of cards.

These are the people paid millions to do their job & they failed miserably. There are many reasons home owners can't pay. I am sure there are some who gave fraudulent information, but I am also sure you'll find many who weren't over their heads when they got into the loan but have been affected by the downturn in the economy. Additionally you will find stories of people who know they can no longer pay & are trying to do the right thing by working with the bank to adjust their payment plan or arrange a short sale, but often banks have been very hard to work with or it's even difficult to find out who owns your mortgage due to the mess (mortgage inside an MBS inside of a CDO is parts of which are inside another CDO, that is owned by a firm that was bought out by a firm within another firm).<p>As for banks falsifying documents, here you go:<p><a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/07/20/wells-fargo-subprime-fraud_n_905198.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/07/20/wells-fargo-subprim...</a><p><a href=""http://www.dailyfinance.com/2010/10/02/robo-signing-scandal-spreads-documents-show-citi-and-wells-also/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dailyfinance.com/2010/10/02/robo-signing-scandal-...</a>",1314947822

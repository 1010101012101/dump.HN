104675,comment,104560,104560,0,0,mnemonicsloth,,,"<i>The median startup is a business that's capitalized with about $25,000. The financing of that business comes from the entrepreneur's savings. The business is a retail or personal service business, a hair salon or a clothing store, that kind of thing. The founder doesn't have expectations of a very high growth business, in fact [the entrepreneur is] probably thinking a goal of $100,000 a year of revenue is a good goal.</i><p>The economist guy isn't wrong -- it's the article's title that's misleading.  It <i>is</i> hard to bootstrap your own gas station or hair salon.  I'd argue, though, that developing new technology is a fundamentally different undertaking.",1201370201

104672,comment,104560,104560,0,0,nkohari,,,"There are two kinds of businesses. First, there are so-called ""lifestyle"" businesses, like bars, restaurants, B&Bs, etc. that people start because they'd rather work for themselves than someone else. Most owners of these types of businesses aren't interested in expanding or getting rich -- just doing what they enjoy. Then there are ""growth"" businesses, like (most) technology startups. Many people who start tech startups are interested in working for themselves, but they are more likely to be interested in expanding the business as well... not to mention the most important fact, that technology companies can expand much faster than other types of companies. As demand increases for, say, a website, it's much easier to scale up the infrastructure by adding new computers than it is for a hotel chain to build new hotels, or a ""brick and mortar"" retailer to build more stores.",1201369700

Further, I don't think relational databases scale linearly either, and it is notoriously difficult to implement large DB clusters.",1201369604
104670,comment,104560,104560,0,0,nostrademons,,,"A little more economics and a little less statistics would've helped his argument immensely.<p>Entrepreneurship flourishes when there are diseconomies of scale and dies when there are economies of scale.  It's not hard to see why: if things get cheaper as you get bigger, then the first company to get big will gobble up all the smaller companies, and you end up with a monopoly or oligopoly.  If things get more expensive as you get bigger, then no firm will grow larger than a certain limit, and after a certain point the most productive employees will leave and start their own businesses, because they can make more money that way.  (If costs stay roughly the same, as in most professional services, the industry trends toward many small firms because of the psychological benefits of working for yourself.)<p>Software is the perfect example of a business with diseconomies of scale.  Every experienced software engineer knows that adding people to a project makes it go <i>slower</i>.  The only reason why a large software company might be more efficient than a small one is if there's an additional factor of production that has large economies of scale: for example, data centers (Google/Yahoo), logistics & warehousing (Amazon.com), buyer eyeballs (E-bay, Facebook), or retailing (Microsoft, Borland, Ashton-Tate, and all the boxed-software manufacturers of the 80s).  Other than that, there's no economic reason why big software companies should exist.<p>Big companies buy little companies when there's a market that they want to get into and apply their economies of scale to.  They can't develop the product in-house, because small teams of programmers are more productive than large teams of programmers and so the startup would continually outpace them.  But the resulting merger would be more economically efficient, because the startup could take advantage of the large company's datacenters & warehouses.  So they trade money for product; the small company's founders get rich, while the big company buys a product that can make more profit under the large firm than as an independent firm.<p>It's probably also worth mentioning that technology developments can fundamentally change the structure of an industry.  Intel single-handedly destroyed the minicomputer industry, because those firms had relied on their economies of scale in manufacturing to justify their size, and Intel brought <i>greater</i> economies of scale to the thousands of ISVs who could then produce software more cheaply than the big proprietary vendors.  The RIAA held a distribution lock on the music industry for years, but when the Internet came along and made distributing music free, power shifted to the independent bands who have significant <i>diseconomies</i> of scale.  The Internet looked like it was heading towards a universe of big firms with large datacenters, but then LiveJournal and Flickr published their scalability approaches and made it possible for everyone to scale out for free.",1201369360

Rent is too damn high and no one wants to pay it, and we seem to be the only ones who can. But lets get some perspective here. I&#x27;m willing to posit that the relative high rent prices has give our industry to greatest boost of all in town [<i>quick edit: for clarification if everyone is pushed out and only tech workers can move in, does that not just create room for more founders? Not at all arguing that wasted money is good</i>].<p>This city is still the Gold Rush, always has been. People move here with the dream to make a ton of money and have a good time, most likely moving away after <10 years when they get serious about family. This city is fueled by alcohol and general hedonism, which is fun! San Francisco is an awesome place to live, and people want to live in it. Tech workers move in to town and push everyone out, blah, blah, blah -- but its true, for better or for worse. Top talent not only wants to work in the Bay Area, but are also so often willing to throw away everything to live in San Francisco. The Valley down south has been there for half a century, attracting the best and brightest in the world.<p>Its only now, with this Second Boom&#x27;s influx of new businesses into the City Proper and the realization company-provided motorcoaches to bust the commute, that the tech workers are really pouring into SF. We&#x27;re the only ones who can afford to live, so we stay here, working more and founding more businesses. If the price continues to go up (mark my words, no more than 30% above now), rather than be threatened, the industry will slowly spread out to the periphery. What is startup-rich Soma was urban blight during the 90&#x27;s, the periphery.<p>I&#x27;d be the first to argue that urban development is good, especially when done effectively (not the conversion of existing rental space into high-HOA condos), and quickly (unlike commercial real estate development in Soma and South Beach). Just realize that we are the kings of this age of this city, and we are the last ones who would be at threat, especially when you can just move East or South and ride the comfy bus in to work.<p>tl;dr Nothing threatens tech but the drying up of capital to be invested in new business.

The point is that because of Intel&#x27;s experience, sheer size, and resources, they have a massive leg up over the very fragmented ARM group. They fuck up all the time, but they almost always catch up on features or optimizations (except for the power efficiency aspect, which I believe is highly dependent on the architecture) and they do so very quickly. When they do innovate (which is very often), others can&#x27;t catch up because by the time they do, Intel is already ahead again (not entirely true, but close enough).<p>&quot;They&#x27;re great at clinging on to their legacy designs, and adopting others&#x27; good ideas after they&#x27;re proven.&quot;<p>I guess everyone just really loves the underdog but come on, read a book.

Is the kbd connected directly to a certain place of memory? How is this implemented? Would there be some screen/gpu HW that is directly connected to the memory region? How is the CPU clock involved?<p>E.g. if you press a key, hold it and then release it, it is possible that this event gets missed as it was too short and the key press method did not check the memory region at the right point of time. For me their implementation enforces this bogus &quot;I am in total control of everything that happens feeling&quot; which often leads to bad design as it ignores the messy real world. I would have appreciated something more sophisticated and generic there which would work for different kinds of HW.

The most efficient farming and food-production systems today produce a unit of food using far fewer resources (people, labor, energy, etc) than were required in previous decades.<p>The people who continue to live in rural areas should focus on farming efficiently for large populations rather than for subsistence. If you can move the subsistence farmers into cities, and if (this is a big &quot;if&quot;) they can work and earn a decent wage without obliterating the current economy, then they will more than likely be better off personally, and will consume fewer resources globally.<p>I happen to think that this is a very difficult thing to do, and that their timeline is probably way too optimistic, but I don&#x27;t think China should be criticized for trying. They stand to gain tremendously if they can pull it off.",1371423706

I was being paid $40k/year, but it was a 6-month internship so really only $20K. But I lived pretty well. I had a bed to sleep on in the city, I went out with friends on the weekends, and had a great time.

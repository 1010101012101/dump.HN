Now, I suppose you could say that tech aggressively enforces a casual dress code, to the point where wearing a suit becomes an act non-conformity.  I&#x27;m not joking here, the blog post is absolutely right, wearing a suit may seem mildly eccentric in a tech company.  I see various people (including coworkers) wearing suits, and there is a counter-culture element to it.  Suits are worn in different forms at the Dickens fair, by jazz and ska musicians (and people in the audience), and by other counter-cultural types (there was a guy who worked at Peet&#x27;s coffee who always wore a suit and bowler hat).<p>SF is a place where this is particularly mixed up, since SF was probably the most east coast-ish of west coast cities where it came to wearing suits as part of the old dress code, and there are still a few more conservative industries here (banking, law) where suits are work as part of the older formal work culture than a new countercultural trend.<p>As for me?  I like suits, I think they look great.  I have never been required to wear a suit to work, so I never really associated them with conformity (I wore them mainly at weddings and a very few parties, so I have positive connotations).  Like Greg Foster (author of the post), people would give me a strange look if I wore a suit to the office, but now that I think about it, there actually is one guy who wears a suit to the office every day...",1445884964

NSA was mainly evaluator rather than developer, but developed some interesting tech of their own. EKMS for key management and especially the inline-media encryptor come to mind. My own IME designs were based on theirs.<p><a href=""https://www.nsa.gov/ia/programs/inline_media_encryptor/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.nsa.gov/ia/programs/inline_media_encryptor/</a><p>However, most of the developments came from computer science, U.S. military organizations, and defence contractors. They produced a lot of secure technology. People in NSA&#x27;s IAD helped where possible. Those same methods are used on select systems today although NSA is fast-tracking everything now for some reason at low-assurance. Probably part of BULLRUN.<p>Anyway, NSA could easily offer good INFOSEC by just applying what&#x27;s proven to work to various use cases as Bell said. Anyone could. Some did to varying degrees: Sentinel&#x27;s HYDRA firewall, GEMSOS&#x27;s thin clients, Mikro-SINA VPN, Secure64&#x27;s SourceT OS for DNS, and so on. Each of these either had clear security improvements or did vastly better on penetration tests with GEMSOS and HYDRA surviving NSA pentests with much praise from evaluators.<p>So, people wanting security should just apply what works to every part of the stack. Won&#x27;t be easy. Will take time. Will probably be incremental. Nonetheless, insecure protocols, monolithic kernels, C libraries... these things have never worked and never will. Just doing the opposite of mainstream in key areas will get one far. Imitating the best of the past will get you really far.

10453234,comment,10450099,10450099,0,0,lukedegruchy,,,"Optional (either JDK or Guava) is not perfect but is infinitely better than hand-checking for null.  Among other things, it expresses the intent of the API writer that their method may or may not return an absent value and this is expressed via the type system.  This is in stark contrast to using null as a primitive, which has no such transparency.  For instance, there is no difference in Java&#x27;s type system between a method that intends to always return a non-null String, and one that intends to return a null String under certain circumstances.   Thus it is impossible for the user of the API to determine when to build conditional logic to check for null or when not to bother.<p>In any case, the concept of null as a primitive is fundamentally broken.  Due to Java&#x27;s backward compatibility requirements, it&#x27;s too late to resolve this in that language.  However, newer languages don&#x27;t need to make this mistake.  However, there are &quot;interoperability&quot; requirements for new languages interfaces with legacy runtimes that tempt language designers to build escape hatches.  These escape hatches exist in Swift, Kotlin, Rust, etc even though they&#x27;re not recommended and their usage presents edge cases.<p>Ceylon and Haskell seem to be the only two languages to get this completely right.   Ceylon expresses optionality as the union between the present value type and null, which is an actual type separate from Object.  An optional String is therefore a String|Null, or a String?   Haskell accomplishes this with the Maybe type.<p>All this to say that null should not be a primitive but should be banished to its own corner of the type system with clear compile-time semantics for dealing with the absence of values.",1445883329

Also, ignoring for a moment that no commonly known type of drones would work in the martian atmosphere, stationary solutions have much more leeway for building it to NASA standards - better coils, more solder at joints, etc. I&#x27;m willing to bet that a simple blower hooked up to the energy storage and a timer mechanism could work without intervention for a hundred years or more - if made in the way they did it 40-80 years ago, as opposed to today, where all consumer devices are as crap as producers can get away with, on purpose. Contrast with (hypothetical) service drones, when every gram of additional reliability is cutting into the flight time.<p>As for what kind of drones could work on Mars... well, leafblowers on service rails or on wheels are the only things I can come up with that make sense.

Take a sequence of four flips. Consider five cases:<p>1. 0 heads. Probability of head following a head=0<p>2. 1 head. Probability of head following a head=0<p>3. 2 heads. Probability of head following a head = 1/3<p>4. 3 heads. Probability of head following a head = 2/3<p>5. 4 heads. Probability of head following a head = 1<p>Now if those five cases were equally likely, then what would be the expected number of heads following a head?<p>Answer: (0 + 0 + 1/3 + 2/3 + 1)/5 = 0.4<p>Is this what they assume gamblers are using for &#x27;empirical probability&#x27;? I can&#x27;t tell.",1445882554

I stick out amongst the hoodies and sweatshirts around me, but I&#x27;ve never felt any reaction more malicious than confusion.<p>Originally I picked this style to see if an orderly fashion imposed any kind of order upon my mind. (that was about 5 years ago, give or take a year) If so, I&#x27;ve not been able to discern it.  I did, however, enjoy feeling a little different, and over the years as my middle-aged gut expands, I find the vest far more slimming than a Tshirt.<p>This leaves me in the position of being a touch conformistly counter culture AND fat.

Many of the current CSGO pros using 4:3 AR came from CS 1.6 and I think they just never felt like changing. There&#x27;s no competitive advantage to it. If anything it&#x27;s a FOV loss and thus a slight <i>disadvantage</i> but it&#x27;s so minor as to not matter most of the time.",1445882542

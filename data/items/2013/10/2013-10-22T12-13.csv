6591509,comment,6591112,6591112,54,0,simonsarris,,,"The missing profit is a blessing for Amazon.<p><i>None of the other titans are challenging Amazon.</i> They can&#x27;t because Amazon&#x27;s Earnings Per Share are...<p>-0.23. Negative 0.23.<p>Investors often lump AMZN with GOOG and the like but GOOG&#x27;s EPS is 33.59. TGT? 4.26. Walmart is 5.07.
No other company with a market cap (100+Bn) as large as AMZN is allowed to get away with negative EPS. The only one that comes <i>close</i> is Vodafone, with a tiny positive EPS (0.13).<p>It&#x27;s important to note that if any other company spent until their EPS was negative, investors would <i>flip.</i>
Amazon is playing with razor thin margins while trying to scale up a platform to end all platforms that we might someday use for everything without thinking about it. If successful, on that day/year/eon dollar bills might as well be printed with Jeff Bezos&#x27; face on them.<p>Amazon won&#x27;t be using UPS and Fedex trucks on that day. They&#x27;ll be using Amazon trucks. You&#x27;ll know that era when you see it, I think.<p>If you&#x27;re Walmart or Target its hard to justify trying to do something similar at this point, the stock could take a major dive from such a risk. They&#x27;re at the &quot;Ask-questions&quot; phase, and the questions are always &quot;What&#x27;s the profit?&quot; because these are publicly traded companies. Amazon has been playing it risky since the get-go.
Bezos is in for a very long gamble, and that frustrates the hell out of some investors, but its lofty enough to still attract investment dollars while in the &quot;build-first&quot; stage. Hopefully they can pull it off for a few more years before the stock market shifts to asking questions.<p>So Amazon gets to play the long game that other companies are literally disallowed from playing because investors that have seen profits want more. Amazon gets to do something bold that would cause the mother of all stock dives in any other 100+Bn company. They get a free pass because Bezos is convincing and for Amazon its <i>sort-of-always-been-this-way.</i> Walmart/Target/Etc do not have either of those luxuries - the incredible (or believable) visionary and being a company that&#x27;s still in burn (build) mode.<p>~~~<p>All that said, an interesting question I think: What can we do to make more companies like Amazon? And is there a way to allow the older giants (such as Target) to ever be as ambitious again, without huge stock punishment?",1382446790

Now we have 50 plus.&quot;<p>You can have even more if you choose to stick to UNIX philosophy of having &quot;programs that do one thing and do it well&quot;, and you also can have only a few, if you choose software suites (and counting one such suite as &quot;one&quot; program), that do a broad range of things, so it&#x27;s a mater of personal choice in the spectrum of software solutions.<p>&quot;One part of the potential solution may lie in an app-centric operating system (OS), instead of the current file-centric(OS). In an app-centric OS, the file/folder management is a background (system/app level) process, similar to what you find on current smart phones and tablets.&quot;<p>Again, it&#x27;s a personal choice. In the desktop you may interact in an &quot;app-centric&quot; way. You open your application and then do things inside it. Opening automatically an associated application when you&#x27;re opening a file is only there for your convenience, desktop or phone/tablet BTW. It&#x27;s a no-brainer!<p>&quot;To access the last run I completed, I dont have to wade through the files on my iPhone to find it. I simply open the app, and the relevant files are accessed and presented to me in a meaningful way within the app interface.&quot;<p>Some sort of history and in-app access to recent files (read &quot;works&quot;) was there long before the iPhone! And that&#x27;s beside the examples of Spotify-like desktop apps &quot;partially doing it&quot;.<p>Files in current computing systems are like cells in the living organisms, like atoms in physical mater. Of course, there is file-less information transfer inside the system, just like there is chemical transfer among living cells, just like there is sub-atomic interaction among chemical molecules, but some sort of structure inside a given individual information system is needed, just like was needed in the nature itself. The entire article seem like a rant against the nature of things only because &quot;I can never remember where I file the bloody things.&quot;",1382446672

I often battle friends on Facebook over issues of politics, economics, and stuff, and I definitely notice that people are generally more interested in winning than learning. In fact, that&#x27;s the model cable news shows and presidential debates teach us. It&#x27;s all about introducing some obscure fact or anecdote that your opponent can&#x27;t possibly know off-hand to force them to have to research enough to rebut, acquiesce to your position, duck and counter with their own obscure fact, throw an exasperated ad hominem, or quietly slink away. But none of those tactics involve actually trying to learn some better picture of the truth or examining your own belief schema.<p>I think we&#x27;ve kind of moved to a post-fact society in this sense. Every position has it&#x27;s own set of miscellaneous facts that seem to support it, and those facts are typically unverifiable, or at least certainly unverified.

Although Standard had 90 percent of American refining capacity in 1880, by 1911 that had shrunk to between 60 and 65 percent, due to the expansion in capacity by competitors.[41] Numerous regional competitors (such as Pure Oil in the East, Texaco and Gulf Oil in the Gulf Coast, Cities Service and Sun in the Midcontinent, Union in California, and Shell overseas) had organized themselves into competitive vertically integrated oil companies, the industry structure pioneered years earlier by Standard itself. In addition, demand for petroleum products was increasing more rapidly than the ability of Standard to expand. The result was that although in 1911 Standard still controlled most production in the older US regions of the Appalachian Basin (78 percent share, down from 92 percent in 1880), Lima-Indiana (90 percent, down from 95 percent in 1906), and the Illinois Basin (83 percent, down from 100 percent in 1906), its share was much lower in the rapidly expanding new regions that would dominate US oil production in the 20th century. In 1911 Standard controlled only 44 percent of production in the Midcontinent, 29 percent in California, and 10 percent on the Gulf Coast.[42]&quot;<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Oil#Monopoly_charges_and_anti-trust_legislation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Oil#Monopoly_charges_a...</a><p>There&#x27;s also no great evidence that Standard Oil raised prices once they had established such large market share.

6591436,comment,6588572,6588572,1,0,Jtsummers,,,"I did a few things when I started working.<p>First, I&#x27;m very conservative and got hired on during the 2008/2009 financial melt down. I saved up enough cash to survive for a year (I was still used to college spending so this didn&#x27;t actually take long to accumulate). I put this cash into 4 CDs, each is a one year CD and one comes up every 3 months. The interest isn&#x27;t great, it&#x27;s pretty bad, but it&#x27;s better than the interest on a savings account. This isn&#x27;t an investment, this is &quot;in case I lose my job or get furloughed or ...&quot;. I&#x27;ve since made it a point to bump up the amount in the CDs to represent my current cost of living less things I can easily cut every couple of years.<p>Second, I owned my car outright at the time, I put the equivalent of a car payment (it was old then) into a savings account every month. I used this to (almost) pay cash for my new car this past year.<p>Third, I put a similar amount into a brokerage account, but I didn&#x27;t start that until after I had that 1-year fund. I&#x27;m not a great investor, I can&#x27;t give advice on this part, I&#x27;ve just gotten lucky on a couple things but mostly played it safe.<p>Fourth, I know how much cash I need in my checking account every month (with a buffer, just in case), so at the end of the month I transfer the excess to my savings. (This year excepted, a bunch of unexpected medical expenses)<p>The result is, if I lose my job, I have enough cash on hand to get me to my first CD&#x27;s maturity date, and they can each carry me to the next. This is a lot of peace of mind for me after seeing many colleagues laid-off in 2008/2009 and others who&#x27;d been unemployed for a year or more. In my current job that&#x27;s a low risk, but once the money is saved you can ignore it (until you need it). I also have enough cash + credit that, in a catastrophe, I could carry myself to the CD maturity dates to pay off the debt or, worst case, I could take a hit on the CDs and close them early (I wouldn&#x27;t lose much, penalty is the interest + a fee and the interest is low at the moment).<p>This next part is US-centric, I don&#x27;t know the UK&#x27;s retirement system.<p>Retirement, here in the US we have (at many companies) 401k&#x27;s available with some matching. I put in the minimum needed to get that matching: it&#x27;s free money for retirement. I put in more now that I&#x27;m in a better paying job and have my other finances in order. We also have IRAs, another retirement account, I&#x27;ve been maxing that out since my 3rd year of full-time employment, I could have started my 2nd year but decided the 1-year fund had priority at the time (I don&#x27;t regret that decision, my employer at the time laid a lot of people off that year and my office was next on the chopping block). Whatever the UK equivalent is, explore them. I know too many of my peers that have no savings or minimal savings for retirement, we&#x27;re obviously 20-30 years away from it, but investing earlier you&#x27;ll get a much greater return, and when you have a family and need money for those sorts of expenses, you can (though you should try to avoid this) cut back on your retirement savings without too severely impacting your retirement goal.",1382446048

Absolute control over a huge chunk of worldwide B2B and B2C transactions is extremely valuable <i>per se</i>, in political and commercial terms.

Bezos just bought the most influential newspaper in US political circles; this guy knows a thing or two about setting the agenda.<p>2. There is corporate profit and personal profit. Amazon employees are themselves turning quite a bit of personal profit. Does that make Amazon a No-Profit ? That&#x27;s debatable. As someone else mentioned, pure profit is easy to  tax, while &quot;operating expenses&quot; and share dealing can be shuffled around.<p>3. Industrialism. Many XIX-century industrialists saw their companies as agents of change as well as sources of profits. Amazon is pushing the envelop in commercial infrastructure (fully-automated warehouses, software-enhanced packaging, customer-seller variable relationships, etc etc) as well as creating whole new markets (AWS).

So while applications today each create an abstraction (e.g. SQL index) on top of the filesystem, what is really needed to provide the &quot;iOS experience&quot; while keeping normal file systems below, is simply an OS-level index with metadata. I can&#x27;t see how it can be preferrable to have each application have an inconsistent DB of files and their metadata, versus having the OS/filesystem provide one.<p>As for the mp3 scenario: for a 1Gb mp3 player its certainly doable to just scan the contents for the files/metadata once in order to show track titles etc. 
The problem is when the collections of files grow by several orders of magnitude and you need instant lookup of metadata (e.g. a 1Tb photo library, which isn&#x27;t even especially large these days, my camera takes 25mb photos with hundreds of pieces of metadata that can&#x27;t be encoded in the filename unlike an mp3 track).",1382444597

That&#x27;s all fine and dandy, and isn&#x27;t I don&#x27;t think directly controverted by evidence; but in the same statement, I think it is far from affirmed.<p>The second side, then, is what I see this all as evidence of.  Disclaimer, I know fuck all about the subtleties of running large businesses, but when you step back and look at the what they&#x27;re doing at a high level, expanding facilities, exploring new markets, new products, during what is as the article stated an investment boom time and where maintaining a certain level of revenue might be a &quot;somewhat safe bet&quot;, it makes sense to me that you would use this time to make more bets.  Risk becomes more acceptable when you&#x27;re not living dollar to dollar; the box of nails anecdote, simple as it is, spoke buckets to me. (maybe I&#x27;m overreading.)  At the risk of showing extreme naivete, I would LOVE to for once believe that a company is simply using all of its financial resources to continually try to provide optimal and novel services.  Shipping goes up in price; that&#x27;s how the market works when you add more services without anyone funding em, the cash has to come from somewhere.  I guess my hope is that the shipping is only raising due to their trying to provide new services, and that there will still be sufficient competition that amazon hasn&#x27;t killed off to prevent this from going out of hand; and that it was just as I said above, a way to fund growth and try to balance for changing economic times, and not a sign of the impinging amazon monopolypse.<p>Oops, suddenly essay, and now I&#x27;m late for work...",1382444433

The visual processing all in Haskell from the noisy sensor of a Kinect.<p>The examples aren&#x27;t immediately there to follow as it&#x27;s not a tutorial, but it&#x27;s a good look into the space of some real, complex hacking going on.<p><a href=""http://vimeo.com/77164337"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vimeo.com/77164337</a>",1382444086

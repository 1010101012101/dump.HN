8130252,comment,8126902,8127544,1,0,waps,,,"> Gent and Brussels had connections to the Scheldt, but never were on the coast.<p>That&#x27;s true. Both Ghent and Brussels had harbours that were on the coast though. The Brussels one was less than 20km from the city center, the Ghent one less than 5. And those harbors, were technically on the Schelde river, sure. But the Schelde is a river delta. Where does the coast start ? At the end of the river (which was a ~150km stretch of nothing but water), or where the waves stop (there were tides and waves in the Brussels harbour). So I see where the argument comes from, but let&#x27;s be fair here : they were as much on the coast as, say, Rotterdam harbor is today. I think most people would agree that is on the coast.",1407124636

8130244,comment,8127012,8130195,1,0,crdoconnor,,,">I did see (in the Straights Times) a PAP politician about 1.5 years ago go down for having accepted sexual favours from the sales staff of a corporation in exchange for granting that corporation government contracts (I can&#x27;t remember any names with which to google the case). I loved the fact that in Singapore, this behaviour is punished and government members are held accountable. In many Western countries (not to mention guanxi), it&#x27;s the accepted means of doing business. Let&#x27;s not even get into what happened with US defense contracts in the last 10 years...<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Yamamah_arms_deal"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Yamamah_arms_deal</a><p>&quot;In 2010, BAE Systems pled guilty to a United States court, to charges of false accounting and making misleading statements in connection with the sales.&quot;<p>The China, the West and Singapore all enforce rulings against corruption sometimes... and sometimes not. I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll see any of the corrupt Indonesians who stash their money here get prosecuted for instance. They&#x27;re even better protected by the financial secrecy laws than oligarchs in London are.<p>>In my experience, all government officials I have known have been professional, rational people with great values, imbued by a sense of mission conspicuously absent from the civil servants I have known in other countries (who fit the &quot;House of Cards&quot;/&quot;Yes Minister&quot; profile more closely).<p>Basically because they pay better here. That&#x27;s good in some ways. In other &quot;yes minister&quot; countries they actually supply a state pension to poor people over the age of 65 instead of forcing them to scrape shit out of a food court toilet in the last pathetic years of their lives.<p>It&#x27;s a country of polar opposites. The greatness of the country depends entirely upon your position in its class system, though. Based upon all of your answers, I&#x27;d say you&#x27;re pretty far up, and believe me, I can well understand why you love it here.",1407124455

Price signals are based on demand. The same demand is still there in the sense that customers still interact with private health providers. The only thing that changes is payment is now handled by a single government system. Uncle Sam guarantees you access and his guys sort out the payment with the private provider, later.<p>> The (slow, error-prone) political process is engaged in every buying decision.<p>I&#x27;m not sure I agree with your premise for a start (i.e. publicly ran organisations are necessarily slow and error prone) but setting that aside, why is bulk billing between government financiers and the private health providers not an option? The government knows how much demand they have for XYZ product or service so they can negotiate based on volume. Have I missed something?",1407124044
8130221,comment,8128700,8129891,3,0,vacri,,,"<i>Please show me a windows laptop that is still worth even half it&#x27;s value after 2 years.</i><p>About two months ago I was looking for a Thinkpad w700ds, and while admittedly an unusual laptop, I found two items on ebay going for more than they originally cost. As for a 5yo laptop costing $1500 after resale, the laptop I currently use is a Thinkpad x200, a 6yo laptop that I bought new for $1300 and I see now on ebay for an opening bid of $200. $1300/6 = $217/year (less if you count the $200 ebay sale), which is cheaper than any of the options you&#x27;re proferring. Where is this magical Apple-only value you&#x27;re talking about with laptops, then? I find that Apple fans are very skilled at convincing themselves that everything else sucks, which is fine (each to their own) until they start proselytising. Yes, Apple machines do hold their value well, but from your own numbers breakdown, my Thinkpad more than holds its own if you want to talk turkey.<p>In any case, the point I was making wasn&#x27;t about the resale value itself, it was that most folks don&#x27;t actually resell their computers.

I loved the fact that in Singapore, this behaviour is punished and government members are held accountable. In many Western countries (not to mention guanxi), it&#x27;s the accepted means of doing business. Let&#x27;s not even get into what happened with US defense contracts in the last 10 years...<p>In my experience, all government officials I have known have been professional, rational people with great values, imbued by a sense of mission conspicuously absent from the civil servants I have known in other countries (who fit the &quot;House of Cards&quot;/&quot;Yes Minister&quot; profile more closely). I guess we&#x27;ll know in 50 years when archives get declassified.<p>At the end of the day, we can&#x27;t know what the opportunity cost of having all the talented politicians join PAP for career reasons is, simply because there is no equivalent anywhere in the world.

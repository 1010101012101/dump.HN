548810,comment,548296,548703,0,0,anamax,,,"> Societies where marriages are based of 'love' have a very high divorce rate. Divorce in America or Europe is not easy, it's a long and expensive process. But there is still a 50% or so divorce rate.<p>Since those exact same societies had a low divorce rate not too long ago, it's unreasonable to blame the high divorce rate on what didn't change between then and now (love-based) and ignore what did change (ease of getting a divorce and stigma).<p>Yes, US divorce is expensive and can be long, but it is also socially accepted and easy to start.  The latter is more relevant than the length and expense of the process because said process keeps itself moving.  (The expense and length is also a choice - the choice to fight, which has nothing to do with ""ease of divorce"" or love vs arranged.)",1239026231

SQL is highly flexible and you can dynamically update the database format at run time which few ""modern"" languages let you do.  IMO, The problem is developers who think OOP means all data must map 1 to 1 with an object which manipulates that data and then complain that the database is now tightly coupled with their code.<p>As to scalability it's that's a software problem that has little to do with the relational model.  A link's to B and B is somewhere out in the cluster works just fine.  You can even write a relational engine that uses a key value store to keep the records.<p>PS: I like to think of it as Java/C++/whatever infecting the database.",1239025576

Their crime ""lab"" turns out to have been a sham and that's supposedly one of their best features.<p>> Plenty of examples of national/federal law enforcement, they seem to work OK.<p>Oh really?  How about some actual evidence instead of quotes cribbed from their funding requests.<p>> Large governments have their flaws, but it's hard to see a viable alternative.<p>Small govts of limited scope are pretty easy to see.<p>> Greater international cooperation would hopefully act against this kind of thing.<p>Hope isn't a plan.  Greater international cooperation doesn't have the properties you assume.  We have agricultural subsidies because the contries involved want them.  We'll stop having them when they don't.  International cooperation won't change that.<p>> And then you come up with that point, in which it would obviously be a good thing if a supranational body had the power to force the US and the EU to abolish an unjust subsidy.<p>You misunderstand.  You're claiming that the WTO is good.  I'm pointing out that it isn't good because it hasn't done the good thing that is obviously within its scope.  Claiming that it could doesn't change that fact.<p>> You were holding up isolationism as something good, and I was pointing out it has been on the decline for a century, with few bad effects and many good ones.<p>Actually, you didn't point to any effects - you merely pointed that it was in decline.<p>>>How does getting a bunch of evil together in the same room produce good?<p>> My suggestion was that you'd have the major trade blocs sitting around a table, and empowered to authorise, or not, wars.<p>Trading blocks are composed of nations and we've already heard about nations, namely ""I would be a lot more persuaded by your points about an evil supranational if we didn't see so much evil perpetrated by mere nations all around us.""<p>> It would produce ""good"" in the same way that getting a bunch of evil people together to make the laws they all have to live by would produce ""good"".  Even a society of murderers doesn't want to make murder legal, since they all have to live in it!<p>Except that it doesn't work that way.  The murderers don't want folks murdering them, but they don't extend that courtesy to others.  You need mostly good to pull off good govt and that's not an option at the supranational level.<p>> You can question the IMF's methods but they're hardly a ""disaster"".<p>Actually, I can question pretty much everything about the IMF as it has been a disaster in both methods and results.<p>> There are plenty of good supranationals, and they all seem to be working OK, or at least not actively bad.<p>The good ones have extremely limited scope and are in areas where standards have huge benefits to all parties and almost no downside to anyone.  (That's why I mentioned the radio folks.)  The WTO is on the edge of that and starting to fail.

I apologize.<p>And I'm sorry if I have lost all patience with phrases of the form <i>X is a slower language than Y</i>. These catchphrases are <i>everywhere</i>, major technical decisions are often based on them, and they are often <i>worthless</i>. They are overgeneralizations.<p>To make such a statement meaningful, the least we need to know is: What problem did you try to solve? What languages did you compare? What frameworks, compilers, interpreters, libraries, helper applications, and/or platforms did you use? Can we see your code?

Which you never question or test. And then you mislead everyone. You even mislead yourself! And even if you happen to be correct, for a given problem on a given day, things can change by next week. For example: the Javascript interpreter folks are working <i>wonders</i>, speeding certain computations up by <i>orders of magnitude</i>. (The Chrome JS interpreter nearly made me weep with pure joy.)<p>I don't see how we're going to break people of this bad habit except by correcting them, one by one if necessary. We certainly won't learn from history: We went through <i>all</i> of this with Java, less than a decade ago. Java was famous for being ""slow"", until one day everyone realized that it wasn't ""slow"" anymore and that it hadn't been for a couple of years. Now people hold up the JVM as the canonical example of a <i>fast</i> thing!

Assuming three letters from the valid [0-9A-Za-z] you have 62^3 possible links _per domain_.  Extending to four characters you'd have 62^4 (over 14m links _per domain_).<p>So an amazon.com link would drop to 25 characters.  A TinyURL link is currently 25 characters (bit.ly would be 18).  So this is still in the ballpark.<p>Of course, the results aren't consistent (e.g. a ycombinator.com link would have 30 characters).  But it would give a lot of information.

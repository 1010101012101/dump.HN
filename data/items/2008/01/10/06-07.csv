We all know people who made a good career with that attitude.\nI think at least one should be able to believe that one is right and the rest of the industry is wrong. Sometimes it really is true. As an example, most people on news.YC seem to believe that Java is bad, in contrast to almost the entire industry. (I am not sure what is true in that case).",1199948375

96692,comment,96423,96423,0,0,Kaizyn,,,"If I could only work with one language, then I'd have to say Forth.  While I don't know this one nearly as well as any of the others, this one allows you to work at the assembly instruction level up through the level of abstraction of languages like Python/Javascript.  Lisp on LispMachine hardware would offer you the same sort of advantages.<p>The C and D languages look like they might also be fairly good choices.  Everything else doesn't seem to give you the flexibility to go down to the metal while also having the ability to move up to much higher levels of abstraction.",1199947551

Maybe your script should be ""mcdonaldsrestaurant#{i}.com""<p>There was a thread on reddit where people had gotten NS to register some names that might be awkward to explain to any outsiders (gross, non-pc stuff, etc).

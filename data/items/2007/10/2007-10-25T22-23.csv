The big numbers come when your data is produced by a simulation, or when you're doing OLAPey things with O(n^2)-sized intermediate results.  Real-life example: keeping a log of all users, the IPs they've logged in from, and when, and looking for evidence of sockpuppet accounts.",1193352598
72711,comment,71952,72590,0,0,falsestprophet,,,">Actually historically there were numerous instances of largely-homosexual civilizations. Just look up the true story behind the movie 300.<p>This is anecdotal evidence. Isolated societies that practice homosexuality do not offer a sound argument against the general trend. Note that you can only think of a few examples. <p>>I think you completely forgot about masturbation, which pretty much destroys that entire line of argument ;) Males ""waste"" sperm on a constant basis. :)<p>Recall that is is a conversation about bisexuality and homosexual behavior, not homosexuality which is obviously not evolutionarily helpful to a homosexual man (although there are theories that account for the genes that increase the liklihood of homosexuality having an evolutionary advantage for the women that carry them). Evolution is not a boolean question, traits propagate according to their relative success. Men who only want to have sex with women are more likely to deposit more sperm into women than men who deposit sperm wherever it fits. Masturbation would work against both populations. <p>>Actually in many societies men were NOT focused on social interaction with females.<p>I did not say interacting with women. Lots of people interact with women without reproducing. I said 'interfacing,' which was meant as a euphemism for fucking. I will spare you the confusion of further euphemisms. Son, people fuck everywhere.",1193352481

72702,comment,72402,72649,0,0,pixcavator,,,"There may be a point here, but I am still uncomfortable with the use of the Pythagorean theorem here. Even if applied to areas only, it seems like a stretch. In fact with this approach one can suggest other identities. For example, if you replace squares with cubes (or circles with spheres), you will have a^3+b^3=c^3. And this clearly has nothing to do with the Pythagorean theorem.",1193351452

You don't imagine the search engine is putting stuff <i>in</i> to the database do you?<p>From the link above, ""Do any of these with your ""big hash table"" in less than 1 second""<p>1 second is eternity as far as my search engine is concerned.  If I can't handle a request in less than a couple of milliseconds, I'd say I've failed.  I've used this same approach in the past on a search engine that indexed 14 million records btw, and I didn't fail ;-)",1193351373

72697,comment,72560,72560,0,0,neilc,,,"Well, I think the point is that Microsoft gave Facebook $240 million in exchange for a few things. A ""strategic alliance"", 1.6% equity stake, an advertising deal for Facebook ads outside the US, etc. Now, it's not correct to just multiply those numbers to arrive at Facebook's book value, but the deal certainly values Facebook very highly: as a company that Microsoft is willing to essentially <i>give</i> $240 million to at a very generous valuation. So while Facebook aren't a $15 billion company, they're a company that can raise $240 million in exchange for a small equity slice and an ad deal -- which is a very highly-valued (overvalued?) company indeed.",1193350524

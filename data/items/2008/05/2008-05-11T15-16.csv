It uses the same type of paper (probably not the exact pattern) and I think all these pens with camera + special dotted paper are using the same licensed tech from Hitachi. Paperium also has special areas where you can point with a pen and send stuff over bluetooth over to your computer. Bluetooth connectivity was the reason why I didn't consider other USB pens (Livescribe seems to be USB). It gives you feedback as a series of short vibrations. Once it's on your computer, you can do all kinds of things including change the thickness, change the level of smoothing of the lines, export to Illustrator etc. This is all easy since the pen captures the vector data.<p>I've also started using Evernote which is this cool app that allows you to archive and search stuff within notes, pictures etc. It works really, really well. Even though I have a writing style of an old doctor, it recognizes my writing just fine.<p>The audio features of Livescribe don't appeal to me much but whatever works for you..<p>Paperium has solved my throwaway paper napkin doodlings problem quite nicely. I used to take a pic of my sketches/explanations with my phone and send it around that way but this is so much better. Can't recommend this type of tech enough!",1210521580

186900,comment,186870,186870,0,0,st3fan,,,"""""""This seems horrible design to me. """"""<p>Have you actually read the code? I just did and there is barely any thread-related code in the example. It's mostly code to push and pop stuff from a queue.<p>Personally I would turn this into a little Java/AWS framework whose API is based on a high level queue object to abstract away the communication with SQS. Probably simply modelled after a java.util.concurrent.BlockingQueue and configurable through Spring so that it becomes a nice reusable component.<p>Then it gets totally simple and interacting with those (remote) queues will not be any different than with one kept in memory for example. Since it is all thread safe it will be a no-brainer to create a simple workflow where you take stuff from one queue and put it in another.<p>I seriously don't understand why people are so afraid of threads. All you need is a good and well tested abstraction for common patterns.<p><a href=""http://www.javaconcurrencyinpractice.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.javaconcurrencyinpractice.com</a> is probably a good start for Java people with the threads-are-evil mindset.<p>S.",1210520195

186896,comment,186545,186545,0,0,eisokant,,,"I've read over the comments and I absolutely don't agree with those saying a business plan should not be a priority. If you do it right and spend a lot of effort on it from the start, it's not just a documentation for possible investors but becomes a set of guidelines for your company. It forces you to sit down and really analyze your product, market and the goals of your startup.<p>Personally I've read my fare share of literature on business plans but must say the book ""The Definitive Business Plan"" by Richard Stutely stands far above all. It's not written with a specific focus for a Web 2.0 firm but will give you a really clear overview of what you would want to include.<p>I hope I have been able to be of some help.<p>Best regards,<p>Eiso Kant",1210519738

186892,comment,186659,186694,0,0,nostrademons,,,"A lot of advertising isn't targeted towards getting you to buy things now, it's so that when you <i>do</i> go out and buy things, you'll recognize their product first and prefer it over the competitors that are also sitting on the shelves.<p>As a kid, I always wondered why companies bothered to run TV commercials.  After all, you aren't likely to jump off the couch and buy a car <i>this instant</i>, no matter how much Ernie Boch tells you to.  But a friend's mom explained that they don't care if you buy <i>now</i>: they advertise so that in a year or two, when you find yourself in need of a car, the first place that comes to mind will be Boch Toyota.<p>It's amazing how many people don't do any research on consumer purchases and instead rely on a simple recognition heuristic.  Even people who should know better.  The reason my startup's on GoDaddy is because when my cofounders bought the domain & rented the server (before I came on board), they just went with whatever they'd heard of.",1210518911

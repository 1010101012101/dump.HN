I was sitting there with my sales guy, and I didn't like something he was doing on the calls - I forget what exactly, but something didn't sit right with me.<p>I couldn't quite articulate what was going wrong, so I just I started dialing up a bunch of people myself. ""Hi, this is Sebastian... yeah, me, I run things around here... anyway, how'd you like the talk? Oh cool. Anything I could've done better? No? Nothing? Come on now, don't mess with me dude. Oh, that <i>is</i> interesting, thank you. Anyways, I wonder if our company can make your life better. Where you at right now? Uh-huh... and how about this particular solution? Uh-huh... yeah mate, I got something good I reckon we could do for you.""<p>People <i>love</i> hearing from the high-ups in a company. And you completely lose track of real life if you're not actively spending time in the trenches. That means doing any role you yourself can do periodically, and buying tea/Japanese food for engineers and technical people whose jobs you don't understand, while really testing their patience with your dumbass, Luddite questions. And constantly reminding them that you know you're a Luddite, but you really want to understand what the hell is going on in the trenches anyways.<p>Call people. They love it. You won't come across as desperate unless you actually are desperate, and even then, the desperation vibe will fall off if you call even more people.",1235728595

With a good education, you have both a skill, and a certificate saying you do.<p>Without an education, you might still have a marketable skill, but people have to take your word for it.<p>Personally, I don't have a university degree. I do have a marketable skillset, but it's up to me to prove it, and through a bit of luck I'm in a pretty good position. But it's certainly not a path I would recommend others to travel, you leave too much to chance.",1235728392

Timing out of old messages is a nice feature of this solution. These are dirty hacks comparing to a ""proper"" solution but sometimes they are OK enough.<p>Beanstalkd has a memcached like protocol but designed for simple queues.

497063,comment,496946,497048,0,0,davidw,,,"No, there are no silver bullets, but it seems to me that people reach for Mysql a bit too quickly, without considering the pros and cons.  And while it's improving, Mysql has had many frustrating things in the past... to me it's always seemed like a ""worse is better"" kind of thing.  Sure, it's ""fast"", but at what cost?  Once you go to InnoDB, you lose that speed advantage.<p>One thing that's not a tech tradeoff, and is generally a Postgres win, is the BSD style licensing.   You can take Postgres and do whatever you want with it with no worries.<p>> Google tried to switch their ads system from MySQL to a ""real"" database once,<p>I hope the part that actually handles money has been fiddled with by Google to be robust.",1235728089

497055,comment,495961,496259,0,0,thwarted,,,"I've found the thing that helps me get into the zone with first-person-shooters, especially with CTF varieties, is knowing the map well enough to be able to predict where everyone is on the map based on where you last saw them -- how long a flag run takes, what the major routes are through the map, getting hit from that angle at that location means someone is sneaking around over there... and it doesn't even need to be exact, not ""it takes 18 seconds to cap if you can run at full speed"" (which is useful in its own right), but rather ""the flag was picked up just as I respawned, and I'm here, and that's when a cap occurs..."" or ""I saw that guy when I died on that side of the map, and he should be crossing this area just as I respawn..."" or ""when I'm holding the flag here waiting for our flag to return, attacks usually come from that location, so let's pop a few grenades over there to keep it clear..."".<p>Unfortunately, many FPS maps are created to be simple and _fair_ in the extreme, which ends up severely limiting the kinds of routes you can take (everyone's instinct is always to take the shortest/fastest one, or all routes are roughly the same length), or where the serious choke points are, so if you spend _merely_ weeks playing the same map, you can get a really good feel for the basic attributes.",1235727086

497053,comment,496754,496973,0,0,timr,,,"Are there more biotech startups than 30 years ago?  Sure.  But probably not more than 20 years ago, and certainly not more than a decade ago.<p>There's plenty of evidence of a shift toward entertainment.  Look at the big startup successes of the last decade:  Google, Myspace, Facebook, Friendster, YouTube, Blogger, Flickr, Digg, Bebo, etc.  Save Google, nearly every major success story has been an entertainment/media play.  In fact, I don't see this argument as particularly surprising or controversial, given that the web has been the dominant technology of the last two decades, and that the web has <i>always</i> been about media.<p>I think we both agree that personal ambition is pretty much constant over time.  My argument is that if that's the case, then it's <i>not</i> reasonable to argue that people preferentially sought out ""safe"" jobs three decades ago.  Smart, ambitious people have always sought out the opportunities that make them most successful; today those opportunities are clustered in industries that reward ephemera.",1235726865

Implying that teachers get paid more so they can afford California's ""standard of living"" rings more accusatory to me than if the author had attributed it to ""cost of living,"" but I don't know if he's right, if he's wrong and deliberately wrote that to fan the flames a bit, or if it was an honest mistake.",1235726803

I have worked in the web industry since I was 16, done freelancing for couple of years, involved with few startups and currently a co-founder.<p>I know that I don't necessarily need the degree. For the most part it seems useless. I'm quite sure I could find a job, my financials are not that bad, I could even start a startup, but still feel that I'm not somewhat ""ready"" or have lucrative options enough to dropout.<p>My current solution is just to read for the exams and skip most, if not all the classes and work on other things. Good thing is that college education here is basically free, so I'm only loosing some time. But still, most of the time, I dislike everything with institutional education.",1235726777

Google tried to switch their ads system from MySQL to a ""real"" database once, and it was basically a disaster and had to be abandoned in favor of MySQL (I wasn't working on it, so I can't really give all the details).<p>Another problem we had with MySQL that Bret didn't mention was that it would try to be ""smart"", and sometimes it would ""randomly"" (from our perspective) choose a very inefficient strategy, and we would have to waste a lot of time figuring out what it was doing and how to force it to do the right thing. The approach Bret describes basically avoid any MySQL ""smarts"" and treats it as a dumb, but fast and well tested B-tree. This gives us fairly reliable and predictable performance characteristics because we know exactly what it's doing (mostly).",1235726576
497047,comment,496745,496955,0,0,thwarted,,,"It is interesting that a relatively advanced piece of software, message queues, which most run of the mill projects most likely have no need for, has an interface that is compatible with a simple, straightforward protocol that was designed for everyone and their dog.  I mean, if you need message queuing, you most likely have someone on staff who can design, write, and deploy a protocol language (especially if they can write the queuing software also) and who doesn't need to use compatibility libraries.<p>Great, your memcached-compatible queuing service can leverage all those memcached client libraries out there, but somehow I don't think that client libraries are the hard part of the queuing service.",1235726247

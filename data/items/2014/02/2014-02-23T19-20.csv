I feel like computing is such a large beast that one can find two very informed people disagreeing while each being right in wide area.<p>I don&#x27;t think you can even call memory allocation &quot;just another OS service&quot;, (much less garbage collection). Memory allocation is going to be ubiquitous in any application and if it&#x27;s performance degrades, so will the application&#x27;s performance. Further, one knows nothing about &quot;what&#x27;s behind the curtain&quot;, performance will degrade for any <i>medium performance or higher</i> application.<p>Java is perfect for enterprise code because most enterprise software is more forcused on data-safety and generally playing well with the rest of the data zoo. Enterprise software isn&#x27;t high performance and thus the costs of c++ outweigh the benefits. Or even more<p>C++ is needed in system programming and shrink-wrap software where performance is crucial.<p>On the other, other hand, if a dominant OS forty years ago had imposed a GC model that became ubiquitous, perhaps the sweet-zone where the programmer doesn&#x27;t have to worry about the allocation process would have been larger and the area where you did have to worry about the allocation process might not have been harder to deal with. Especially, a single ubiquitous program layout model would force hardware makers to adapt and what I understand is that a lot of the need for multiple memory/program-layout models comes from innovative hardware getting the last once of performance through constant novelty in low-level memory access.",1393185590

Factory barracks are commonplace in China and other developing nations.  Railroad workers, sailors, and other travelling employees are often lodged by their employers.  I&#x27;ve also seen more than one startup in which there was a corporate apartment, though that was usually used on a fairly short-term basis by new hires, or in some cases, by founders or remote employees when travelling to other sites.<p>One of the earlier examples of this was the Fuggerei in Augsburg, Germany, though more strictly it was an example of social worker housing:  <a href=""http://www.lonelyplanet.com/germany/bavaria/augsburg/sights/other/fuggerei"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lonelyplanet.com/germany/bavaria/augsburg/sights/...</a><p>The &quot;Company Town&quot; Wikipedia article offers more information on the practice.

Then some browsers started running plugins in separate processes, but still not in a sandbox. This allows the browser to survive Flash crashing, but doesn&#x27;t improve security. Some browsers have gone further and added a sandbox to the Flash process, but I believe that each browser uses its own sandboxing mechanism, with different security properties. Additionally, some browsers now use their built-in updating mechanism to update Flash binaries, instead of relying on Adobe&#x27;s questionable updater.<p>I&#x27;m not too familiar with what other browsers are doing, but I know Chrome&#x27;s version of Flash is different from other versions and specially built for Chrome.

It is conceivable that one of these providers (I think it was Cogent in this case) was offering &quot;<i>low rates</i>&quot; to take Netflix traffic and deliver that traffic to Comcast over their settlement free peering. As traffic flow between Cogent and Comcast was increasing, Comcast refused to upgrade the interconnect to accommodate the flow. Then: links get hot, traffic gets dropped, customers complain, Netflix+Cogent asks Comcast to behave, Comcast offers to unblock the pipes via direct Netflix<->Comcast peering for a &quot;<i>fee</i>&quot;.<p>Now I don&#x27;t know whether that &quot;<i>low rate</i>&quot; that Cogent was charging Netflix was lower than a &quot;<i>fee</i>&quot; that Comcast is charging.

The PM then tells the in-house Ford team who supports the code after its written this idea and they freak out because it completely breaks the semantics of the API.  German folks didn&#x27;t care because they get paid more and they need to keep their customer happy, the PM.  Ford engineers care but don&#x27;t have much power to fix the solution other than one off hacks to get the software done in time to meet the vehicle launch date.  Customers suffer.

If you have relatively balanced flows, and meet other qualifications, you can usually get free (settlement free) peering.  If your flows aren&#x27;t balanced, then the tradition is that whoever is sending more pays. If the networks you&#x27;re establishing paid peering with are cheaper than your transit provider (usually the case), then peering is still a win for you, and a win for the other network.<p>If Netflix wants to get settlement free peering with Comcast, they need to balance their traffic to Comcast (maybe partner with a backup service, or web crawler)",1393182560

It&#x27;s ideal when there is an equal exchange here and no money is involved.

The moment I feel any pain, on it goes - whether I&#x27;m going to type more or not, the brace is necessary to take the strain off and allow the wrist to recuperate.<p>I really regret not discovering that a few months sooner, because I may have done some permanent damage.  The problem is that (counterintuitively) just taking a break from typing and resting the hands doesn&#x27;t take the stress off - the neutral position/state of the hands keeps a great deal of stress on the wrist.  I can infer this because the pain continues when I take a break, but goes away the moment I put a brace on.  Only when I put a brace on, did my wrist get a chance to &quot;heal&quot; - simply taking a break didn&#x27;t help.<p>YMMV, but -man- I hope this advice happens to help someone - it took a long time for me to figure this out.  I only figured it out because a physical therapist friend of mine told me it sounded a lot like certain kinds of tendonitis she&#x27;d run into with athletes, and suggested the brace.",1393182526

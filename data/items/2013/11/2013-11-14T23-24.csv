6736662,comment,6733584,6733584,2,0,kapnobatairza,,,"Programmable mag stripe cards are really nothing new. This implementation is quite nice and sexy though. I can see immediate problems with it though:<p>1) Card thickness. Most makers of programmable mag stripe cards try to make their card the same thickness as a normal sized credit card. Why? Because thicker cards might scrape or get stuck in credit card readers (as old Amex black cardholders know). Unfortunately it has to be think because of the following:<p>2) Older iterations of this idea usually involved the bank/card issuer supplying cards with multiple card numbers preloaded on it. This card in novel in the sense that it has some writable memory that you can personally store your existing cards to. However this involves a few elements that add to the thickness of the card: It involves a non-volatile memory module for storing the cards, it involves a volatile memory module for holding information about new cards, it involves a bluetooth module for communicating between the volatile memory and your smartphone and it involves a battery to run it all.<p>3) The battery is non-rechargeable (because any existing type of charging point would add too much to the thickness), so the card only lasts for a specific length of time before needing to be replace.<p>4) There is a move away from mag stripe everywhere in the world but the US as mag stripe is really shit compared to chip and PIN for security. Even in the US, mag stripe will be phased out within the next 10 years. This card can&#x27;t even store CVC security codes (the 3 digits on the back of your normal card).<p>5) They have added a security feature that ties the card to your smartphone such that it becomes &quot;deactivated&quot; (locks the non-volatile memory) once it is loses contact with your smartphone for too long. What this means in essence is that you cant use your card without your smartphone. So that begs the question: Why would the consumer adopt this instead of adopting a smartphone based NFC wallet if its available to them? Google Wallet stores any credit card I put on it, and if the merchant doesn&#x27;t support NFC Google Wallet still displays an image of the card for manual number input. You might say that a merchant might get scared away from a transaction if you ask them to do that, but a merchant might get scared away by asking them to run a unfamiliar looking unmarked black card.<p>Regardless of the above, it is cool stuff and there is a niche that it will be useful for, at least until chip and PIN / NFC wallets become widespread in the US. I&#x27;m working on some similar ideas so I thought I&#x27;d toss in my two cents.",1384473154

Network (bandwidth) technologies are among those, but they have a strong step-function characteristic to their improvement.  This accounts for the delay in end-to-end deployment of hardware improvements needed.  This also creates a perception of sustained changelessness followed by rapid change (e.g. dialup modems to DSL/Cable).<p>Any improvement to payment infrastructure suffers from a much more entrenched form of the network upgrade problem.  This stasis works to the benefit of companies (e.g. Square) who can provide value without having to move the world.  Coin also fits into this opportunity/risk model.<p>The risk, which that quote hits on, is that Coin is already too late: if a payment network transformation lands too soon, it could leave Coin&#x27;s bright idea in the dust.  In that light, saying &quot;it&#x27;s been on the way for the past 10 years&quot; is <i>more</i> worrying rather than less.<p>But there are upsides. Imagine that Coin grows into its meta-card future, eventually supporting EMV[1] as well as easy revocability and reissuance.  Lose your Coin?  A quick report and it&#x27;s revoked and all of your cards are reissued onto a new Coin.<p>[1] Per Coin&#x27;s FAQ, they do not support EMV, aka &quot;chip and pin&quot;, yet.

Shouldn&#x27;t you be interested in feedback so you can get better, not just so you can get paid more? If so, shouldn&#x27;t you be getting it all the time, instead of twice a year?<p>What&#x27;s the goal of a raise? To keep you from being effectively paid less (because the cost of living keeps going up), and to make sure you feel satisfied with how much money you&#x27;re making. There&#x27;s nothing in there about making sure some people feel less appreciated than others. So pick a percentage number, preferably one that&#x27;s above COLA, and just give everybody that. If that&#x27;s not enough, your base salary isn&#x27;t enough.<p>Note that none of these goals overlap. Feedback and salary don&#x27;t really have common goals. If you&#x27;re trying to get people to do better work by dangling the salary carrot, you&#x27;re taking away intrinsic motivation  see DHH on mixing open-source and money, he did a good job with this topic  and you&#x27;ll end up with less performance and motivation, not more.",1384472534

To elaborate, my use case is this:<p>On YouTube, the only channels I read comments on are the educational ones (Crash Course, Grey Explains, SciShow, etc.). For everything else, I don&#x27;t care much for hearing what other people think. So in my use case, I honestly haven&#x27;t seen much profanity or bad comments in my entire time using YouTube.<p>For Google, I use strict Safe Search because I don&#x27;t care for NSFW content. I also work at a school and when I need to search for images to use on handouts, I don&#x27;t want any NSFW content to appear.<p>> Then wouldn&#x27;t it make more sense to complain that Safety Mode should filter &quot;bad&quot; comments rather than all comments entirely than to complain that you want Safety Mode and Safe Search to be in different states?<p>No, because prior to Google forcing my G+ account to merge with my legacy YouTube account, I was able to have these in different states. YouTube had Safety Mode off and Google had Safe Search on. If Google is going to force people to merge accounts, then they should not be removing functionality that existed when the accounts were separate. Complaining for a feature to change, when it was working perfectly fine on its own before, is far less productive than pointing out how two features worked separately before they were merged together. This also ties in with what theOnliest says below. There is a very distinct different between the two use cases (reading YouTube comments and using Google Search). It does not make sense to merge the two features; especially if you aren&#x27;t going to rename then into a single feature (there is no indication on YouTube and Google Preferences that changing one will affect the other).",1384471579

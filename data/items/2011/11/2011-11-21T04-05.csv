There's a $50MM company moving in across the street that keeps inviting me to parties because they can't find enough people to hire.  I probably get 5 e-mails from recruiters a week.<p>In the contracting game, there are unfortunately a large number of people who don't have a good appreciation of your costs, much more so than web dev or other types of contracting.  Sifting through the haystack to find the good gigs is a royal pain.<p>As for the work itself, it is definitely low-level development, and when done right, it is fun & rewarding. You get different kinds of performance problems than you would get with web dev, which is fun, and the release cycles cause you to come up with some interesting solutions for tracking down and fixing issues.  When you're fixing bugs in that codebase from India, on the other hand, because they wrote 20 KLOC in a single file and not a lick of memory management in the lot, you start to ponder your sanity.",1321851593

If I'm being honest, I think the Wikipedia option often provides the most value to the world at large: my contribution will be found/read by more people there, can be improved upon by others to snowball into even more usefulness, etc. But I would probably <i>capture</i> more of the value if I blogged it, because that'd build my personal brand, could generate AdSense/Amazon revenue, etc., while it's harder (though not impossible) to parlay being a respected Wikipedia editor into any sort of benefit.",1321851317

There is absolutely no incentive to lower costs or improve efficiencies. It does indeed become a game of brinkmanship between maximizing costs (profits) and cancellation.<p>I have seen it used in construction to mitigate risk. One example springs to mind. A particularly wealthy but eccentric individual wanted to build a lavish home. He was notorious for changing his mind, adding to the project and so on. The only way the company in question would touch the construction contract was on a ""cost plus"" basis.<p>Whenever you do this you basically have to trust the provider to a certain extent and it only really works if they trade on reputation and a hit to their reputation actually matters (often it doesn't).",1321849902

Now, after the recession, where are all these people? <i>crickets</i> Our banks in Canada were one of the only in the world to <i>not</i> suffer serious hardship coupled with millions of dollars lost in foreclosures, lost benefits and savings. This was, without question, due to regulation. Canada would not be in the position it is today had it deregulated the banks. This is a fact served by many, many examples throughout the world.<p>Admittingly, not all regulation is good. Matters like these should be investigated on a individual basis with due process. It isn't a matter of deregulation vs. regulation. Or Canada vs. USA. These mindsets are dangerous as they rubberstamp behaviour without consideration to the influences these actions may or may not have.<p>The CRTC needs good reform, but full deregulation is not my preference. The CRTC must encourage (require?) innovation for Canadians. That's the problem. We're unhappy because we don't  have the innovations we should - and we pay top dollar for archaic services.<p>Deregulated media only means Bell/Rogers/Shaw will eventually be in the hands of conglomerates. There are financial advantages to this, but a boat-load of disadvantages not seen immediately. Do you think Comcast or AT&T would continue to employ 50,000+ people in Canada to uphold their Canadian operations had they the opportunity to purchase our telcos? Doubtful. What about our programming? What about censorship in the media - would we eventually adopt the American model if it's less work for them to uphold our model with theirs? With SOPA, we'd essentially inherit American policies without force. Not something I'd consider an improvement.",1321849276

Musk says a lot of the answer is in the governments traditional cost-plus contracting system, which ensures that manufacturers make a profit even if they exceed their advertised prices.

Because youve got to go report to your shareholders why you made less money. So their incentive is to maximize the cost of a vehicle, right up to the threshold of cancellation.</i><p>I can't help but think of all the other places where that kind of system operates and makes costs much higher than they should be... How much better would the world be if fewer resources were wasted thus?",1321848015

The type of abuse pointed out in the article isn&#x27;t really different than picking of fat people, or bald people or people who are to skinny, to tall or to short etc.<p>To me, personally, racism is about hate. Making jokes or teasing someone about their physical appearance or racial background, to me, isn&#x27;t racism per se.<p>My wife told me a story; She worked in a noodle bar behind the counter. One day some people who had eaten in the place paid and when they walked out the door one of them turned around and said to her &quot;Fucking monkey!&quot;. Now, to me, that IS racism. Not this because this asshole happen to say this to my wife but because there is a tone of hatred in it.<p>To me the article sounds a bit juvenile. As if the author thinks that only Chinese or people of Chinese heritage get picked on or teased in daily live. People will pick on each other and will make jokes about each other and they will use the most prominent physical feature to do so.<p>However, I do agree, this sort of behavior by an adult man (gay) on prime time television is pretty childish.",1385323144

6790785,comment,6790392,6790392,15,0,strictfp,,,"I think that the article uses a bad example. OO is actually really bad in db apps (DTO apps). OO shines when you are in one big continuous memory space, and don&#x27;t have to worry about the data behind the objects. I see OO as a good way of abstracting the data away from the logic of your program.<p>This abstraction works well with classical desktop apps (lots of code, one big heap, pointers are always valid), but breaks down badly when your program is about communicating data and you start to cross memory address barriers.<p>A lot of modern apps are about data. You see a lot of networked apps, db apps and layered apps with different technologies in every layer, communicating with each other only through shared data formats. Such an app is primarily concerned with shuffling data around, and oo breaks down into a horrible mess. Each transition to a data representation requires a complete serialization of the object graph to a reasonable data representation and back again at the other side. This means that you essentially have twice the amount of work than if you would operate on the data directly as you would do with FP.<p>Once the amount of &quot;internal juggling&quot; with the data exceeds a certain limit, OO might be beneficial.

Even worse to equation production values with merit or quality of the end product.<p>There have been several low budget films and tv shows that have become highly successful and well regarded, the same is and will be true in the online realm. Look at Mad Max, which was made for around a third of a million dollars, Primer, or Napoleon Dynamite.<p>But also it&#x27;s not just production value or even quality but fundamental differences in character. TV was a different sort of beast than film, and even over the last decade commercial TV has changed a lot. Look at all of the independent content that sprang up on non-network TV channels, especially from HBO. A show like The Wire, or even more so The Corner, was very unlikely to ever be made within the confines of traditional network TV. TV has a different sort of character than film in terms of the sorts of productions that are suited for TV, and online video is different as well, but we haven&#x27;t seen all of the ways that&#x27;s so.<p>One example I&#x27;d highlight is the Lizzie Bennet diaries, a modern adaptation of Jane Austen&#x27;s Pride and Prejudice in vlog form of over 100 &quot;episodes&quot; of typical youtube length (~3-5 minutes).<p>Another example would be Periodic Videos (and related projects).

6790702,comment,6789905,6790050,1,0,rz2k,,,"I think the confusion here comes from viewing it as a single issue with <i>sides</i> rather than multiple aspects.<p>It&#x27;s a crude comparison, but it reminds me of a discussion on Reddit where someone was struggling over whether it was time to put his dog down or not. One poster responded by essentially asking whether the OP liked their dog, and if they did why they would kill it, and then summed up by stating that anyone who could consider euthanizing a dog never loved it in the first place.<p>I actually like the sentiment if it is talking about a dog that had grown inconvenient, and it was probably expressed by someone who deeply cared about a first dog, but had never had a dog grow old. Of course, there were some pretty irate responses from people who had dealt with the real situation of a dear friend no longer enjoying life and feeling constant pain. Perhaps one of the difficult parts is that even the clearest cases, it is just resigning yourself, since doubts will always remain. It isn&#x27;t difficult to imagine that you can always induce one more tail wag from your suffering dog, or presumably to imagine a glint in the eye from a loved one. That OP was in search of information to help make a difficult decision, and the only context that was relevant was that particular dog&#x27;s health, not someone&#x27;s ideological objection seeking to make it an issues with sides.<p>Imagine for a second if there were a <i>sides</i> debate over &quot;medication&quot; (of all types). There would be many constituencies lining up on those fakes sides. Some would talk about abuse, and health danger of using too much medication. Some would talk about personal liberty, and that people should be able to take what they want. Then there are some who believe that suffering is intrinsically virtuous, while others believe it is unethical not to treat pain. Some might believe that it is cheating for someone who doesn&#x27;t exercise to take statins, while another group would argue that as prevention they ultimately save money and increase quality of life.  I&#x27;m sure the people with eugenicist tendencies would want their say, too. And quite likely all of this would occur without any consensus over the relative importance of making people productive, or lucid, or comfortable, or keeping them alive, because the importance of these goals aren&#x27;t only personal, but informed to varying degrees by the differences in regional and socioeconomic cultures.<p>Simply put, there aren&#x27;t two sides to the vaccinations-and-marijuana issue, because it isn&#x27;t even one issue in the first place. Is there someone who worries that it is a slippery slope from using general anesthesia in the operating room to vaccinating children? Probably, but you&#x27;d have to accept a lot of premises before even being able to engage in such a conversation. While there may be people who are in favor of or against two independent things for a single reason, those reasons are not the reasons that most people care one way or the other about either. Conflating them would be a trick to elevate those frameworks.<p>Likewise, whether or not to knock off an older person who wants to live but can&#x27;t pay for their nursing home, isn&#x27;t the same issue as assisted suicide, which isn&#x27;t the same as a &#x27;do not resuscitate&#x27; order, which isn&#x27;t the same as decisions about who does or does not get access to a life-saving operation.<p>Allowing special groups to decide which issues get conflated into a single debate and then turns into two sides is an abdication of the responsibility to think critically on important policy matters.",1385321206

Unless you are legally married or a minor (when your spouse or parent can act), nobody can intervene to make medical choices for you. Under privacy laws, nobody can even ask about your condition. So your live-in lover or best friend is helpless to change how you are cared for -- unless they are named in a document like this one.<p>Part 2 expresses your wishes on how you want to be cared for at end of life.

On my form, for example, I specified that if I was unable to read, to watch TV, or listen to audio with comprehension, and had no reasonable prospect of regaining those abilities, my life was over and I wanted to refuse all medical interventions except pain management.

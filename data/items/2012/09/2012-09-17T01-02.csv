4531021,comment,4530217,4530750,1,0,rdtsc,,,"> Why does Dart look so boring?<p>So it appeals to the widest (and thus) more average programmer.<p>Languages have an implicit audience and purpose. For example I consider Java a language designed to be consumed by code-monkeys. The mentality that you have a large enterprise project and you look to India to hire 200 programmers to finish it for you. The language has to have static typing, it has to be familiar to those learning previous languages (C++, C), IDEs are the preferred work environments, everything is very explicit and verbose.<p>Take Haskell, it is a language that would appeal to an academically minded developer. Someone who knows about catamorphisms, uses words like endofunctor, or say wouldn't mind struggling for weeks to comprehend what a Monad is.<p>Those are 2 different audiences. Neither language is better or worse, they are just tools and in some cases one is a better fit, in other case another one is.<p>Dart is closer to the Java.. It wants to be used in large code bases, by many (including average and junior) programmers. So adding things like fancy list comprehensions, de-structuring assignment, pattern matching and stuff like that, might not fit with its goals.",1347846389

That said, I don't think your other two claims are well supported, that the sharks are 'arrogant' or that their valuations are too low.<p>Lets look at the valuations first, in any open market where prices are flexible buyers tend to feel folks ask to much and sellers tend to thing folks offer too little. If you walk away from a deal feeling like you didn't pay enough for something or that you sold it for too much money, then that market is out of balance. There are three sharks, I've not seen any credible evidence that they have any anticompetitive agreements in place, basically they seem able (and willing) to jump into another shark's negotiation and screw it up to gain leverage. So of the three of them the valuations are no doubt precisely correct. You might find an investor who is willing to give a higher valuation, but if you did that with full disclosure that these three would not agree to a higher valuation you might find it hard to justify. This disparity often arises from emotional involvement with the concept or the company. The wine-by-the-glass[1][2] guy is a classic example. They disagreed on value, he turned them down, and kept cranking. Were they 'wrong' ? No, the valuation to them was $x and to the owner $y, but they see a different business than the owner does.<p>As for arrogance, these folks seem to get a lot of pitches, I'm sure being on TV doesn't help with reducing the volume. The weird thing is, they still listen. You can hear that in their analysis. Arrogance would have them not listening and just telling the person pitching is wrong, but they give them a chance to explain, sometimes repeatedly. Its clear that some of the people coming on the show have done exactly <i>zero</i> homework, haven't even done a network search for starting a business or what it takes to run a business. I am really impatient with folks like that but the sharks take it in stride.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.copadivino.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.copadivino.com/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.aoltv.com/2011/03/21/shark-tank-inventor-wine-by-the-glass-turns-down-deal-video/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aoltv.com/2011/03/21/shark-tank-inventor-wine-by-...</a> <i></i> WARNING HUFFPO Category 5 MONETIZATION <i></i>",1347846233

OTOH it might be more accurate to say their state is formally unpredictable.<p>A system like the one being described would be more like a multi-threaded critical-path flowchart, where multiple processes are active at a given time. And at any time a high-level linear programming result might mandate a change of strategy based on available resources, even though individual processes continued to follow the tactical flowchart.<p>So even though a state machine approach looks attractive (as it always does), it's a matter of deciding how many states and how many levels. Because of the nature of the original problem and the number of connections with everyday reality, the fact that it was a state machine might escape the attention of even a careful observer.",1347845215

(really they don't; but one needs to be creative)  How do we produce specs that are not the result of committees and packed with everyone's favorite feature?  (and thereby masochistic for any mortal to try to implement)<p>See the 1999 interview with Ken Thompson that luriel posted earlier.  It has some great comments about these dynamics.<p>When I say ""counterintuitive"", I am referring to most programmers, judging by what's said in forums like this one, will _not_ be receptive to perceived restraints.  They will believe it limits what they can do.  Instead, they will see a langauge where there are multiple ways to do the same thing with the same effectiveness as somehow more flexible, making them more productive.  They want hundreds of libraries.  They want IDE's.  They do not want to write things in Scheme.  Some even hate the command line.  I say these things about ""most"" programmers.  Not all.  (thankfully)<p>Again, Thompson's comments are insightful here.  Many programmers are cogs in a corporate wheel.  They have little opportunity to be creative.  They want to save time and effort in any way possible.<p>But some people, the increasingly rare few, will see things differently.  I side with Thompson's preference in that I cannot understand large languages where I have to work from the top down and read a 500 page manual to try to understand all the components.  I cannot manage that degree of complexity as easily as I can I can work with something simple and build things from the bottom up.  (Alas, the things I can build do not amount to a UNIX kernel! :)<p>So, yeah, it's not counterintuitive to me.  It makes perfect sense.

Some questions, if you don't mind:<p>1) The Chinese language seems to be the odd duck in that it demands significantly more time to get a good grip of it. I've read a number of blogs where the language-learner in the end regrets having spent time learning Chinese[1], (something I seldom see for other languages). My question for you: if you had to decide at this point, in this day and age, would you go ahead and spend the time learning Chinese?<p>2) What interesting employment opportunity can be expected do you think, after having learned Chinese? I've read over and over again that every big Chinese company has strong ties to the Chinese gov't, and that no foreigner has ever been able to successfully pull it off (a good example is Zuckerburg -- even though the guy himself speaks a bit of Mandarin and has a Chinese girlfriend). Does that pretty much rule out entrepreneurial success in China for foreigners?<p>[1]: <a href=""http://thelinguafranca.wordpress.com/2008/05/27/why-you-shouldnt-learn-chinese/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thelinguafranca.wordpress.com/2008/05/27/why-you-shou...</a>",1347844291

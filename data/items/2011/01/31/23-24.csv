As would ditching ""the world is one giant grid"" in favor of multiple tables as in a relational DB on the screen. For example if you applied a formula to a table, you get a new table instead of some region of cells that happens to be the formula applied to another region of cells. This also solves the problem of having to enlarge the region where a formula is applied when more data comes in.",1296518373

It does a very good job of those things, and the mechanisms on place like moderating posts and karma all work towards that.<p>With respect to people going off together and starting companies based on ""meeting"" each other on HN, I'm not cynical about that either, I just have no opinion of it one way or another. It's as if you told me that two people met at a bus stop, fell in love, got married, but one had an affair and now they are in a bitter custody dispute. I feel very sorry things didn't work out for them, but as far as the bus stop is concerned, my interest is in when the next bus arrives, and I think the interior of the shelter should be devoted to the schedule, not to their story.<p>All I am saying is that there are established places for entrepreneurs to meet each other for the purpose of doing business, and such places have mechanisms for resolving and/or publicizing such disputes.<p>p.s.

Sure, if your language (like most, sadly) has null as an alternate value for almost any type you'll have to do that, just like in C you have to check for the bounds of the buffers into which you read strings, but that doesn't have to be the case!<p>There are languages that made away with null in general, such as Haskell (yes, I know, I know), where if you have operations that require some null-equivalent, you declare it so by using the Maybe monad, and the compiler will ensure that the null gnomes won't throw a wrench at the rest of your code :)<p>On not trusting the output of other layers/code: it's a great policy, but I do think that we should strive to be able to take more and more things for granted in our code, or at least reasonably for granted, like we usually trust that random bits won't change in our integers because of cosmic rays. And for that the language designers can give us tools in some form or another, if they do their homework. It will only make it easier to live with our limitations.",1296517961

Well don't answer really, it's a rhetorical question, the government buying ownership of new firms is socialist by definition, and this is not a ""Obamer is socerlist derp derp derp"" silliness, but a real concern.<p>This will distort and warp the investment field.

The largest bureaucracy on earth and in history can not make the same decisions, it is not possible.

Bob Smith is an investor funded with a printing press that he prints counterfeit dollars with to invest in companies. Without any concern for business plans or profits, if any VC in the world invests in a company, Bob agrees to double their investment on the same terms of ownership. Also, Bob has arranged with politicians to create many special benefits available only to firms he is invested in, such as expedited patents that aren't looked at as carefully for those in his special Bob Smith fund. Companies they are competing with don't get the same special legal privileges unless they agree to sign the contract with Bob and give him partial ownership. If the business fails, Bob prints more money. If it succeeds, he takes a slice of a real business for himself.

Those YouTube users who do not opt to set their video to private are doing it illegally.<p>Fair use fro educators depends on several factors which I don't think are in your favor. One, fair use limits the percentage of material that can be used, and two, fair use must not hurt sales of the music. With your users likely uploading whole songs, and having the option to obtain paid licenses just like those for dance teachers and studios, either pre-condition is questionable.<p>BMI, ASCAP, and SESAC are the 3 orgs for the publishers, composers, and lyricists in the United States and they do expect choreographers and dance instructors to have licensing to use the music (<i>Grand Rights</i>).

While there are definitely lots of easy ways that Google can improve its translation (introducing a rules-based pre-processor to stop it from screwing up names and numbers would be a good start), it's worth remembering that Google is the start-up when it comes to machine translation. They lured Franz Och (author of GIZA++) away from academia and gave him the computing power to single-handedly crush everyone working on MT in the government-academia complex and in DOD funded companies like Language Weaver. In response, NIST changed the competition rules to penalize Google for not using NIST data.<p>Google needs to improve its Chinese-English machine translation for the same reason it needs to keep working on Chinese -- you can't organize the world's information if you don't understand its largest language. But the underlying problem is that Google isn't engaging with China and doesn't seem capable of hiring people who actually straddle both worlds. Not that it hasn't followed Systran down the rules-based path.<p>Realistically, I don't see any other company out there which is making the sort of progress that they are in MT. The fact they are still wrong on occasion when tackling distant language pairs seems more a result of their being held back by a universal architecture for developing MT systems, not because they need to go back to an exclusively rules-based system.

These posts claim that I am a pedophile and that I have stolen money. These posts are false and I find it unsurprising that they began to appear after I provided information about the possible identity of jiganti's scammer. My name and phone number are easily Google-able, however, I provide it here in case anyone wishes to call me: Louis Marascio,  512-964-4569.<p>I'm posting this because although jiganti's post fell off the front page, <i>this story is not over</i>.  Other HN'ers and I dug up some information about the possible scammer in the original thread. Also, I believe jiganti might not be the only person who's been taken by this guy. Please read the post and thread in full. This sub-thread specifically discusses our findings: http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2158590<p>Our most promising evidence is this: the responsible party is a single user that has at least three handles here on HN: pinksoda, sinkfloat, and BrianHolt. This has not been proven nor has it been denied, and I repeat the last sentence of my findings: I encourage the owner(s) of the HN accounts pinksoda, sinkfloat, and BrianHolt to speak up--and if I'm wrong I apologize.<p>I re-urge you to read the post, the subsequent conversation, and the other linked-to Hacker News posts and make up your own mind. Hacker News is a tight-knit community, and if there is an unsavory character here who's using it as a way to find and exploit young entrepreneurs, then I feel we need to all be made aware of this. If a scammer does exist amongst us, let's all hope a little light will cause him to slither back into the hole he came from.<p>It is important to note that 'mahmud' is mentioned in the first paragraph of the original post. mahmud IS NOT THE SCAMMER.

Since the data are in the auditory domain, the “objects” they generate would be as real as human seen-objects than heard “objects,” that are so difficult for us to imagine.

I mean, as more and more bots create fake clicks and impressions, the value of the traffic itself is reduced.

9796282,comment,9795503,9796238,0,0,SeanAnderson,,,"Indeed. Thus the talks with YouTube. The issue has always been more of a technical challenge than a political/design challenge. The foreground popup page used by most extensions is destroyed when focus is lost which makes it a very poor location for hosting YouTube&#x27;s <iframe>. The audio would stop whenever the popup loses focus. So, the <iframe> is hosted on a background page which, unfortunately, isn&#x27;t visible to the end user.<p>I&#x27;ve known about the issue since day 1 and went into this project with the mindset of, &quot;If I make something cool enough to get shut down then I&#x27;ll consider it a success.&quot;<p>A few years into the project I garnered their attention and was finally able to setup some talks to figure out what my options were for fulfilling their ToS.<p>My initial suggestion was to allow Streamus to follow in the footsteps of the Google Hangouts extension which uses Chrome Panels to display a tab-independent window over your browser. The intent was that the YouTube video could be displayed there and minimized when not wanted. However, this functionality is being deprecated and Google didn&#x27;t have much interest in expanding the usage of it.<p>So, what I&#x27;ve got going now is some code which injects itself into YouTube&#x27;s iframe and sniffs the responses from YouTube&#x27;s server, <a href=""https://github.com/MeoMix/StreamusChromeExtension/blob/Development/src/js/contentScript/interceptor.js"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/MeoMix/StreamusChromeExtension/blob/Devel...</a>. This allows me to pass around a pointer to the array buffer of video data being rendered in YouTube&#x27;s iframe. Using this data I&#x27;m able to sync and re-render the video inside of the popup without having it coupled directly to the audio.<p>So far this seems like a satisfactory response to the issue. It&#x27;s akin to having a YouTube video player running on an inactive tab. The user has the ability to watch the video, but isn&#x27;t necessarily viewing it while listening to the audio.<p>I&#x27;m aware that I&#x27;m playing with fire a fair bit, but I think that&#x27;s the case when using any API. YouTube has been nothing but completely understanding throughout all of our talks.<p>Fallback options include migrating Streamus to a Chrome App, which would not suffer the same issue but, IMO, has worse UX, or migrating away from YouTube in favor of other sources such as SoundCloud, MixCloud, SFX.io, etc.",1435548696

Bear in mind that I&#x27;m in Australia, so $20k - $30k to me might be something completely different to you. From my perspective, if you can&#x27;t find $20k, you aren&#x27;t serious about your business. Also, in my model, $20k gets you to a point where you have a business that you can market, run and start taking orders.<p>AFAIK, YCombinator doesn&#x27;t build you an MVP, or provide you hosting or do all the items on your start up checklist, so I don&#x27;t think this is a fair comparison.<p>As for valuation, at the point that you walk in with an idea and nothing more, I think your idea is worth about $1. Valuation at this stage is fairly meaningless. They are paying $20K at cost for the services I&#x27;m providing. I forgo making a margin on these services in exchange for 20% equity. So, in effect we share the risk. I reduce my risks by making sure I at least cover my costs. They reduce their risks by knowing they&#x27;ll get to MVP stage without any hassles caused by their inexperience or lack of technical prowess.<p>Maybe 20% is too much equity, I don&#x27;t know. What I do know is that I want a potential piece of any large upside I might help create. That&#x27;s my price for forgoing margin on the initial services I provide.<p>Yes, for the model you envision the marginal costs should be low. However, you are looking at requiring a very long runway. How long do you think it would take before you start making money? You&#x27;ve got to include the time not only to launch your own start up but launch the first customer&#x27;s start up that makes money. Considering a potential 90% + failure rate, you might be waiting a while. This is why I think you need to at least try and cover your costs.",1435548246

It&#x27;s really quite addictive, and gives you a &quot;I really made something&quot; feeling that a new backup script or CRUD app doesn&#x27;t quite provide.<p>I too actually started off writing a stack/RPN-style language for the exact reason that I didn&#x27;t want to do a proper parser, but then realized that, for properly recursive structures like in Joy[4], it really makes it easier to just write a parser. And it turns out that a recursive descent parser really isn&#x27;t that difficult, conceptually, once you spend the brain-time to work one out yourself[5]. Like most things programmatic, it&#x27;s tough to wrap your mind around until you&#x27;ve done it once, then it&#x27;s just a matter a typing and bugfixing.<p>Along with the aforementioned Joy (which is a stunningly elegant language), some other languages I find inspiring are rhoScript (<a href=""http://www.rhoscript.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rhoscript.com/</a>), Pico Lisp (<a href=""http://picolisp.com/wiki/?home"" rel=""nofollow"">http://picolisp.com/wiki/?home</a>), and the very clever WadC editor (<a href=""http://strlen.com/wadc-editor"" rel=""nofollow"">http://strlen.com/wadc-editor</a>), which implements a DSL and interactive environment for describing Doom levels in code, rather than by dragging vertices in a purely graphical editor (This isn&#x27;t as crazy as it sounds if you&#x27;re unfamiliar with the limitations of Doom levels, since they are constrained to certain types of simplified geometry that lend themselves well to this).<p>In short, keep it up! I&#x27;ve never had to use any of these skills in my day-to-day work (I&#x27;m not even a professional developer, though I&#x27;d like to be.) but it&#x27;s still a heck of a lot of fun to play around with.<p>[1] <a href=""http://billipede.net/2014/03/30/reverse-polish-cowgirl.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://billipede.net/2014/03/30/reverse-polish-cowgirl.html</a>

Lately I&#x27;ve been unsure of the next couple of moves to make, and seeing how this community is the most intelligent I know, I would like to gain some input.  I get decent grades (3.2 gpa) and I like my classes however I have not found that one niche I really love.  I have also began glassblowing, which is off topic but at the same time is a growing industry. Ive been considering moving to California for a few years.  There, I would hone in on my glass skills (many more artists on the west coast I can learn from) and hopefully begin to pay off my student loans (over 120k in debt, and glass pieces can take 1-15 hours to make and range from $60-2000), save some money by growing my own medicine legally (I spend about 100/week at least on it), and also getting a job wherever I can in my field working a minimum of 30 hours a week.  Also I would be prepared to wait tables or anything else if I needed to. I was thinking of doing this and experimenting in a few different fields of biology until I found the subject I really loved.  My question is does this sound like a feasible path? Or would I be better off working 2 jobs back here on the east coast trying to pay off my loans.",1435547358

To analyse the data and optimise campaigns automatically, that is change the headline, call to action, hero image for the banner/landing page/offer page and also decide what is working and what not working across campaigns, pages, offers, images, text, etc.  Potentially there is a lot of data to pour over.<p>In addition, I&#x27;d love to start figuring out how to analyse and catelog images in our repository.

On freebsd I&#x27;ve got a jailed instance of poudriere that automatically builds binaries of the ports that I&#x27;m interested in with the compile flags I want.  Having a local build server is pretty awesome and makes a lot of things that would otherwise be difficult - very easy.  For example, samba4 needs some compile options flipped on in bind that are not on by default in the binary package (bind isn&#x27;t the default dns server in samba4).  Just add the needed flags to the options directory in poudriere, and now everybody who cares to grab a binary package from the build server can have it - and it is always up to date.  Of course the same thing can be done from the ports tree itself, per instance, but a build server starts to make sense after about five machines.<p>This is actually what got me to switch from linux to freebsd (though had I been around - systemd would have caused a ragequit), after I started running into problems related to how hairy my ~/bin and ~/lib directories were getting.

3192911,comment,3192316,3192316,2,0,snorkel,,,"From my experiences outsourcing saves money but costs velocity. There is much time spent creating detailed specs, clarifying the specs, reviewing delivered code then immediately demanding key improvements made to that code, replacing subpar developers, pinging developers that have gone AWOL, and all of this happening with the usual timezone delays. Sometimes its faster to write the code yourself than it is to create painfully clear storyboards, wireframes, or demand yet another rewrite.<p>To avoid these hassles you have to spend a little more money to include a local manager to drive the outsourced team and be responsible for their delivery.<p>Honestly I get the sense that people who are happy with outsourced code are either unusually lucky to have found a highly skilled and responsive outsource, or more often they just not technical enough to judge the technical quality or the timeliness of what they are paying for. They are happy with the shiny car the outsourced team made and they can't realize the engine compartment is an absolute mess.",1320343122

This ""Special Offer""'s confirmation came to me at 2AM, well after I went to bed.

3192904,comment,3192619,3192619,0,0,drivebyacct2,,,"I was going to post this as a reply, but every thread here so far is talking about this.<p>Saying that ""Android is the larget smartphone platform"" is not in contradiction with the statement that it's unfair to treat all Android devices equally. Nexus devices are superior to other devices in terms of consistency, speed of updates and reliability. Sense and Blur laden devices are less likely to be updated and are historically buggier.<p>It makes sense to lump Android together to talk about a <i>software platform</i> because those are the statistics that matter to mobile developers. They want to know where the users are. When it comes to phone, saying ""Android phones fail more often"", is only one abstract level above saying ""Smartphones fail more often than dumb phones."".<p>While it's a true statement, it's not a complete statement. It seems to make sense to distinguish between manufacturers of Android phones when making these kinds of statements in my mind.<p>Note, I have no problem with this sort of an aggregate report. There just seems to be a lot of ""AHA"" and ""Gotcha"", by talking about Android as a brand and pointing out that Android is considered an ""aggregate"" for platform size comparisons.",1320342961
3192903,comment,3192426,3192439,1,0,nekojima,,,"> What about married founders. Isn't it very important to have an understanding wife?<p>The understanding can have a time, cost and cashflow/earnings limit. At one of my start-ups, of the first dozen co-founders or staff (who received sweat equity at +2%), I was the only singleton. After 18 months it was clear some wives (all staff was male, except for our designer) were beginning to feel that their husbands weren't spending enough time with them, earning enough from the project in the short-term or that they couldn't take vacations as frequently or for long enough. At around two and a half years, there was a revolt by the wives, who had come to know each other, and we had to change some of our practices within the company to accommodate them, or we'd lose staff and potentially many months of development, when we were reasonably close to finishing our first major & deployable build.<p>We were quite open amongst ourselves in discussing the issue, but a considerable problem was that our product (corporate software) had a long & detailed development period and revenue generation was delayed longer than anticipated. Our alpha/guinea pig testing of our product hit has some snags as a result of the revolt and ultimately revenue generation has been further delayed as well.<p>I can understand their perspective and we have tried to accommodate them, but our view (co-founders and senior staff) is that this is our ""retirement fund"" and we want it to be successful in the medium and long term, not a short-term small cash generator.",1320342939

It doesn't add silly buttons that require you to remove your hands from the keyboard to the mouse to interact with. It doesn't add silly gradients that get in the way of showing you text. Aesthetically it's incredibly simple, and interactively it's incredibly complex, but IN A GOOD WAY. Not everything, especially tools, should be easy to use and learn. A well designed application knows its target and exploits it. Vim does exactly that. It doesn't mean it's a catch all tool for everyone, generally those kinds of tools end up half assed.<p>And for the record, I am actually a designer, I used to use TextMate, I now mostly use Vim. The UIs are similar in their sparseness. The 2 small beefs I have with Vim is the title bar text being overly verbose and and the rounded corners added by Lion on the bottom are rendered a bit glitchy.<p>TextMate on the other hand, while a decent text editor, has perhaps the most hideous project drawer around. Wait, actually, TextMate was never 'designed' as you describe it either. It just uses built using Mac OS libraries.

Since e-inks refresh rate is so slow, you typically dont see whats actually come up until youve pressed the button for the second time. So I often double click on words to highlight them, but some percentage of the time this kicks me over into the dictionary and I have to hit back twice to get out.<p>I'm on my third Kindle. The latest one, sans keyboard, is the first to have this problem. It's so annoying. Literally sometimes I'll be in the middle of a great passage and try to highlight it and then I'm brought to the dictionary page for a word like ""the"".<p>Is there anyone on here who is on the Kindle team and knows when a fix for this will come out?<p>*Also, as a general commentary, I think the Kindle is a revolutionary device. Moreso than the iPad. I think Bezos knows full well what he is doing and would prefer to keep it under the radar how absolutely amazing and big this thing is going to be.

3192663,comment,3192192,3192192,14,0,jonnathanson,,,"Just a prediction here, so take it for what it's worth, but my hunch is that the profession of writing is going to fragment into more and more subsets in the coming years. At the low end of the totem pole -- what we'll call ""low-value"" writing -- will be the sorts of articles that software can eventually automate. Things like news updates, information dumps, how-to pieces, lists, summaries, and so forth. Much of what traditional journalism would call ""news"" stories, and what magazine journalism would call ""informational"" pieces, fall into this bucket. In these sorts of articles, substance is more important than style. These pieces are all about the facts, or summations of the facts. Or, in the case of content farms, they're about relaying and recombining information in endless mixes, using provocative headlines. You don't need a Pulitzer-caliber author to crank these out. Hell, pretty soon you won't even need a <i>human</i> to crank them out. It's no surprise that this type of writing doesn't pay well, because frankly, it's the fast food of journalism. It's cheap, it's disposable to the consumer, and so it pays cheaply.<p>On the other hand, higher-value writing will be that which isn't easily automated, and for which style is every bit as important as substance. Fiction (good fiction, at least), features, human-interest stories, editorials (especially those relying on expertise), and so forth. This will be the kind of writing that either pays crap, or pays big, depending on the writer's skill level -- and his or her ability to build a market or following for it. There will always be a need for this kind of writing, and until such time as software AI becomes genuinely creative, it'll be very hard to automate the highest-quality, most interesting, and most innovative stuff.<p>Low-value writing will, if anything, see its value decline even further. It is the equivalent of the man on the assembly line who can be replaced by a tireless, hyper-efficient machine. High-value writing will not, on average, find itself paying more handsomely than it used to. It will still be a high-variance profession. But it will be what remains for professional writers in the age of content farms, automated news, social networking, and so forth.<p>Essentially, the way to earn a decent living in the future will be: 1) be damned good, 2) build and maintain a following, 3) differentiate yourself, and 4) produce at high volume.",1320340354

Which would you like to discuss?  You pulled that quote (as of 2005) off of a graphic, had you read the text to the left you would have seen this: ""As of 2008, statistics report that of 16,277 murders, 10,568 were committed by males, 1,176 were by female, and 4,533 were committed in which the offenders sex was unknown.

It's a huge time savings.",1320339624

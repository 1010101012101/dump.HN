I have a hard time imagining any system that is ever really tamper proof. Much is possible with enough resources, even tampering with the paper ballot. Tamperability doesn’t seem like a binary property to me.<p>When changing one vote costs you a few thousand Euro and the likelihood of the tampering being detected is still substantial (that would be my ballpark estimate for the paper ballot) the system is practically tamper proof and that’s good enough.<p>Sometimes we may even increase tamperability just to get the result we want. Absentee ballots are much easier to tamper with than paper ballots but we have them to allow as many people to vote as possible. That goal trumps the easier tamperability.<p>The problem is not that tampering with voting machines is at all and somehow possible – that’s just the same with paper ballots – the problem is that tampering with voting machines has the potential to scale much better than tampering with the paper ballot. The cost per vote is substantially lower as is the probability for detection.",1282485474

I recall a PyCon talk on security a few years ago where one of the speaker's first slides was a list of passwords with the text ""if this is your Twitter password, change it, then change your Twitter client.""<p>Most of these startups treat the iPhone as if it were some magical device that's plugged straight into their API.  I actually participated on a Get Satisfaction thread for Gowalla where one person claimed they liked that it was iPhone only (which dates how long ago it was) because it made it ""secure"" and couldn't be ""hacked the way Foursquare can.""<p>Needless to say, they were disabused of that notion pretty quickly when checked in at the Gug, the Apple flagship store in London, and my home within the space of 30 seconds.  It literally took 3 minutes to figure out - most of which was spent setting up my iPhone to proxy through my laptop.  They were (and keep in mind, this is back when Gowalla was still iPhone only) sending everything in clear text.<p>They also didn't regenerate session IDs for anything at the time.  I logged out and logged back in, same session ID.  I logged out via my iPhone, loaded up their site and changed my password, then logged back in, same session ID.  Basically, once you had sniffed one session ID you were set.  I tried it a week later and was still able to use the same session ID without any problem.<p>It's amazing that things like session hijacking are so unknown and unfamiliar to people people relying on web frameworks to do everything for them. At the time they were using Merb---I found out by hitting an ""/unknown/and/unknowable/"" page and seeing their backtrace output.  Session hijacking is a solved problem, why they were subject to it I can't fathom.",1282485077

Can anyone help with the bonus question? From searching Google, I read that the reason:<p><pre><code>    assert_equal { :one => ""eins"", :two => ""dos"" }, hash
</code></pre>
gives an error is that Ruby believes this to be a block. But then why doesn't it consider the hash to be a block below:<p><pre><code>    expected = { :one => ""eins"", :two => ""dos"" }

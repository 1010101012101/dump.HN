They'll use thermocouples to directly produce electricity from the heat emitted from the radioactive decay. Ordinary RTG's are generally more complicated, but that's because they're launched into space and there's no simply switching out the generator if something goes iffy.<p>I imagine how they'd be installed would be inside a concrete bunker of sorts. The company would build a underground container with connections leading to the outside installed when the concrete is setting like most foundation works and then place a multi-tonne concrete slab on top so that only someone with a back-hoe and crane can even get to them and open the things. They could easily be placed somewhere even more secure like installed on police property in small communities.",1226253592

There is competition between firms for resources; a mechanism for natural selection, with weaker practices, firms and individuals wiped out; scope for speciation, with the creation of wholly new species of financial institutions a key feature of the past few years; and scope for extinction, with species dying out altogether.</i><p>Reminded me of this documentary I've seen once before but can't remember the title. The film's hook was to approach the modern American corporation as a person then psychoanalyze it accordingly. As you may have guessed, by the third act of the film you want most of these companies under question to  be sent off to the loony bin.",1226253178

358363,comment,358256,358256,0,0,dpatru,,,"A long time ago I listened to ""The Bell Curve"" on tape. One of valuable ideas I got from the book was that we should strive to create a valuable place for everyone in society. Everyone, whether young or old, intelligent or not, should feel that they are contributing something of value. No one should feel that they have nothing to give and that society would be better off without them. Furthermore, we should encourage everyone to give their best to society. Thus, if the best effort a man with an IQ of 80 can do is sweep the streets, then we should give him job as a streetsweeper and not replace him with a robot.<p>To me, this idea, that everyone should have a valuable place is society, explains what's wrong with adolescence. We as a society do not allow adolescents (young adults) a valuable place in society; we should be encouraging them to do the most useful work they can do; instead we discourage them. Sure, there is encouragement for being a scholar and for excelling in sports, but only a few adults are gifted in those areas: those few who will later go on to be teachers, professors, writers, and professional sports players. The rest of them are forced to do work which they are not good at, which they don't value, and which society doesn't value. Is it any wonder they become bored and turn to other things?<p>A better system is described in an old book I recently re-read, ""Farmer Boy"" (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Farmer-Little-House-Ingalls-Wilder/dp/0064400034"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Farmer-Little-House-Ingalls-Wilder/dp/...</a>), not long ago which describes the life of a boy on a farm in New York in the 19th century. He was given as much work and responsibility on the farm as he could handle and he grew to the challenges. At school he learned to read and write and do arithmetic, and at home on the farm he learned to do useful work, negotiate, and spend wisely. When he was about ten or eleven, a wagon-maker offered to apprentice him. In return for several years of work, the boy would get room and board and training in the whole business of wagon-making with the likelihood that at the end of the period, he would buy the business which employed about 50 men. His father preferred that the boy become a farmer like he was, but he let the boy decide, saying to his mother, ""We can keep him here on the farm by law til he's twenty-one, but he won't do any good if he's wanting to go.""<p>Such a system worked very well in the past because it efficiently transitioned young people from a state of dependence on their parents to independence and it's accompanying responsibilities. A possible problem with that system is that it offered young people few opportunities beyond what was available to their parents. However, even then adults had a lot of opportunity to improve their situations by working harder at their jobs and by educating themselves. Today, there are many more opportunities. The job market is global: if you're not getting paid what you're worth, it's easier than any other time in history to find someone who will pay you more. Educational opportunities abound: books are relatively cheap, there are lots of libraries where you can read for cheap or for free, the Internet has lots of educational resources, and there are many institutions offering formal education. In addition, the number of work hours needed to survive is smaller than ever. So the argument that young adults need to be restrained from working and confined to public schools for several years because they won't have an opportunity to educate themselves later is unconvincing.",1226252666

358361,comment,358256,358347,0,0,kingkongrevenge,,,"> Now certainly the value of a diploma as a measure of intellectual curiosity has gone down dramatically, but I believe this was the original reason.<p>I don't think this was ever true.  You can read about the European universities centuries ago and even back then they were about getting the children of the rich to socialize and drink a lot.  More recently Jefferson said his time at William & Mary was waste of time, mostly drinking and riding and such.  In the same period teenagers like Franklin, John Paul Jones, and Thomas Paine self educated to high levels of sophistication while working full time.  In the case of John Paul Jones he was a ship hand from age 13 on at sea for months at a time, for crying out loud.<p>I really think the institutions of higher education have historically boiled down to the library.  Books were extremely expensive and it made sense to collect them in one place for common use.<p>To be usefully educated about anything now is a lifelong process.  This idea that there's something special about four years of the much longer process is a bit silly.",1226252481

358351,comment,357935,358062,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"433 Eros, the asteroid NASA investigated contains more gold than ever extracted on Earth. The total amount of gold on Earth is calculated at $3,000,000,000,000 and this is excluding all the stuff held in private collections and any fabled Aztec lost city of gold. However, I think there's enough economic incentive in space if we actually put a little money in to begin with.<p>If you're wondering just how much 3 trillion dollars is, well that's like the entire cost of the Iraq War there in one rock. Hell, you could buy Alaska and still have like 2.5 trillion to spare.<p>This is the ridiculousness of the arguments against advancing space exploration and technology, because there's more gold in one rock than in the entire world. That's not to mention, there's predicted to be asteroids containing mostly platinum and even more precious metals. For an asteroid of similar size to 433 Eros containing only 10% of its mass as a rare-precious metal like platinum, well that's when you get the capability to buy out the entire planet.<p>So I call 100% bullshit on people claiming there's no economic incentive in space exploration. There's more precious metals than anyone has ever dreamed of, there just needs to be a little spending to get it. Once companies like Virgin and all the other ones trying for space flight and then lunar orbits, it isn't going to be long before one of them figures out they can get to a rock like Eros and mine the hell out of it.",1226251338

Looks like living in a fish tank to me.<p>One thing that I don't get about ""modernist"" home design is all the big multi-use rooms.  I hate that.  I like separate rooms.  Notice how it would be very uncomfortable for two people to live in any of these places.  No privacy.<p>Also, many small rooms is energy efficient.  Traditional English homes have a couple small rooms, with basically just enough room for two or three to sit around a very small fireplace or stove.  Point being you can very efficiently heat just the small room.<p>I think these big, open space rooms are trying to evoke traditional Japanese design.  But because they don't have ceiling to floor shoji screens they miss the whole point.  Shoji are used to break up the space, achieve privacy, and also only heat a small space contained in a box of screens.",1226250605

6000603,comment,6000110,6000541,1,0,bpatrianakos,,,"Why is it so terrible that Amazon know your shopping habits? Honest question. I&#x27;ve heard of cases where Amazon knew a woman was pregnant before her family and such things but I can&#x27;t think of anything that would apply to most people that would be bad and come from Amazon knowing your shopping habits. Heck, even you yourself make a good case for why it&#x27;s helpful for them to do so.<p>Sometimes I feel like people are against this as a matter of philosophy, knowing it&#x27;d be rare for it to have a negative effect on them. And I&#x27;m not saying that&#x27;s bad or knocking it. I&#x27;m just trying to get a sense of why this is so distasteful. I&#x27;ve never seen an Amazon result when I search using the latest Ubuntu by the way. Then again, I&#x27;m only searching for applications or files on my machine. I&#x27;ve also never seen an ad on my desktop. I know these things exsits but don&#x27;t know why I&#x27;m not seeing them.",1373158464

If the specification is syntactically OK as a Turing machine description, and the output is syntactically OK as the decimal expansion of a (potentially infinite) real number, then that string maps to that real number.  Otherwise, the string maps to zero.  Then <i>this particular mapping</i> doesn&#x27;t hit all the real numbers.<p>It&#x27;s obvious that Theorem B is just a special case of Theorem A.  And it&#x27;s also obvious that Theorem A is a trivial corollary of Cantor&#x27;s result (that no mapping from natural numbers to real numbers hits all real numbers), with no Turing machines or computation theory anywhere in sight.<p>I can well believe that Theorem B was either proven by Turing himself, or established in the early years post-Turing; it&#x27;s low-hanging fruit once you&#x27;ve defined Turing machines and are familiar with Cantor&#x27;s results.  And it could hardly have been proven <i>before</i> the Turing machines were defined!  So Theorem B is a special case that could plausibly have first arisen in the 1940&#x27;s, but Theorem A is actually the theorem the author is talking about.",1373158362

6000582,comment,5999103,6000108,3,0,jccooper,,,"No one quite knows, as no such system exists yet, though I imagine SpaceX has some internal numbers. You need enough to slow your mostly-empty (and thus fairly light) stage from its terminal velocity to 0, and however many seconds margin you need to be comfortable.<p>Let&#x27;s do some very rough numbers to get a ballpark...<p>Say terminal velocity is 100 m/s, which is fairly fast, but a rocket is a skinny streamlined thing. (It could fall slower, maybe even 50 m/s, on its side or with parachutes, but parachutes are heavy and complicated, and falling sideways may be difficult to control, but seems quite possible.)<p>Say an F9 &quot;1.1&quot; first stage weighs 28,000 kg. The landing components mostly are already there: the engines are already gimballed and the additional software weighs nothing. Unless you&#x27;re so awesome you can land in a cradle--which is not impossible--you need some landing gear, so let&#x27;s add 3000kg, for a dry weight of 31,000 kg.<p>Amongst all its engines, our F9 has some 300,000kg of thrust. Just one engine is around 33,000kg thrust, so we&#x27;ll probably only use one or two.<p>Two engines will get us easily about 10m/s slower per second, so we need to retro-fire for minimum 10 seconds. You probably want some margin over that; let&#x27;s reserve 20 seconds fuel.<p>F9 1.1 stage 1 will have a burn time of 185s; our retro burn is only at about 25% capacity, so 20s of two engines is worth, oh, 5s of normal burn time. Say about 3% of the fuel.<p>Of course, it&#x27;s not that simple, because (1) we&#x27;ve made the stage heavier with the landing gear, which requires more fuel and (2) to avoid losing performance we&#x27;ll want to add enough fuel to add our extra burn time, which also requires more fuel, and (3) we need more fuel to lift all that fuel and mass we added. The rocket equation strikes again!<p>(Of course, it may not be that bad, because usually first stages have plenty of margin, and most payloads are not max. Maybe if you encounter a really heavy payload you just agree to throw away the rocket that time; use an old one or something.)<p>Most of my assumptions are pessimistic (I think) but in the real world they may turn out optimistic. I would guess you&#x27;re looking at 3-5% of the fuel load for a recoverable VTOL stage. A lot depends on details, as with rockets weight scales very badly against performance.",1373157815

This eliminates pricing competition and will probably give the local booksellers a few more years to live. However: Amazons margin on books is probably the largest ever realized countrywide. Book wholesalers have the contractual right to get the largest discount granted to any customer. This is why basically no-one gets more than 50%. Except Amazon. They&#x27;ll buy from wholesale, but the book will need 1-2 additional days to ship. To get 24h shipping, the publishers have to sell directly to Amazon at 50% rebate plus around 15% for handling and advertising. This way they realize lower sourcing costs than anyone else.

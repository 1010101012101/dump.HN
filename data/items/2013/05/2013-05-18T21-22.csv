They can get that from debt or equity (or maybe the government, but leave that aside).<p>It is a signal that they believe that their stock is highly valued  (or even over valued, but they would never say that) if they are raising equity - otherwise debt might be a more attractive offer. In the end, it's all a balancing act between taxes, cash flow, dilution, and market demand for securities.<p>Any time you raise money, you dilute ownership (or lower cash flow in the case of debt), which has the direct effect of devaluing the stock. But you wouldn't do that unless you thought you could increase the value of the stock by investing that cash and increasing <i>future</i> cash flows. (Incidentally, this is why everyone is so pissed at Apple, who has way too much cash to invest properly - they should be giving it back to shareholders to invest themselves if they can't figure out what to do with it).<p>The cynic in me says, ""beware - this stock is overvalued and they're just taking advantage of that with this offering."" The optimist says, ""great then- they can raise money at a low cost and increase their chances of making it big"". On this one, I'm siding with the cynic. This is highly speculative. Besides, do you want to be the one who is permitting them to raise money so attractively? (That's an open question - akin to paying a stupid valuation for a hot startup because it will not matter one day when it sells for 100x.)<p>I'm reminded of the time when AOL bought Time Warner with it's insanely overvalued stock. Didn't turn out to well for Time Warner shareholders.",1368913305

I joined HN almost 6 years ago -- then I was a naive teenager with a scattered view of the world, though with a ferocious appetite for intelligent debate.

I also have HN to thank for keeping me informed on various fronts so I could make right decisions that were key in seeing my first 'startup' project surviving (thanks patio11 for your instructive thoughts on a/b testing; grellas for legal stuff; potatolicious for thoughts on design, etc. etc. :)).<p>One thing I want to say is: I think it's okay to be ... well, a little bit mean sometimes. My favorite commenter on this site is rayiner -- one of the reasons I like him is he's never afraid to say what he really believes (sometimes in a slightly mean diction), even if it's going against HN userbase consensus. He's not out to get karma (as some other opportunist high-karma users here are sometimes... complete with amazon affiliate links in their comments, indeed, that is singularly the only thing that annoys me about HN). There's inevitably going to be disagreement when we're discussing important things we have strong feelings on. As long as the discussion doesn't devolve into corrosive name-calling and ad hominems it's fine, and I don't think we go that low very much.

I'm not very optimistic about the future of the Wii U though, IMO they are really to far behind with their hardware this generation. Nintendo consoles have never been about the best specs, but the Wii U is just barely matching 6 year old consoles at the end of their life cycle. Not a problem for many games and a large part of Nintendo's target audience, but with tablets and mobile hardware/software based devices getting more powerful each year, in 2 years or so we could have an Ouya 2 or an Apple TV with app store that will take care of the 'lighter gaming' segment that Nintendo pretty much depends on.

One such effect is they way discussions happen. In a village, town halls can have discussions with every member. An idea is brought forth, multiple people make changes, it gets amended, reworked, changed.   In short, topics have some amount of ""persistence"", and opinions have more dynamism.<p>In a city, discussions are more like a broadcast: any member might be able to speak, but they're not sparking discussion, they're broadcasting a point of view, and with so many points of view broadcast at any given moment, it's hard to have a discussion that lasts more than a few hours before the next topic of interest is brought forth. In short, topics seem to have little persistence, and opinions have far less dynamism.<p>It seems much more rewarding in a city to make comments designed to convince the audience of how intelligent I am, because I only have the city's attention for a moment. Perhaps this leads to the preponderance of middlebrow dismissals or other ""how can I look smart here?"" comments. In a village, by contrast, these comments are much less lucrative. If I walk around and the only comment I can give to others is that their new crop idea might not work, I'm probably not going to be very valued,  because people will notice over time that those are the only comments I give.<p>It's difficult for me to articulate quite what I mean, perhaps someone could help.",1368912463

Our parents were just like ""Go to the best college you get into, and we will figure out the money.""<p>The debt was paid off in full 4 years after graduation.<p>And the real reason it worked out were a variety of circumstances that could totally not have been foreseen when we matriculated.  I flunked out of physics twice, and in my scramble to pick a new major and graduate, picked...computer science.  And used a lot of the time I spent avoiding my physics homework to learn a bunch of cool programming languages, make contacts with real programmers on the Internet, and pick up internships.  So when I barely-graduated, I already had a job lined up at a financial software startup that I'd interned with twice.  If I had <i>not</i> flunked out of the physics major, I would likely be just barely finishing my Physics Ph.D now, having lived on $20K/year for the past 7 years, and would be coming into an uncertain job market with few marketable skills, no work experience, and a lot of debt.<p>My sister happened to go to school in Houston, at a school where her geology department had close ties to local oil majors, and so ended up with a bunch of oil industry internships before graduation.  She had two of the majors bidding against each other for her after graduation, and got a lucrative job that way.<p>The interesting thing is that we both went into college knowing very little other than ""Go to the best college you get into"", and came out of it with that being the right choice but for reasons completely different than what we thought they'd be.  A degree helps, but skills and contacts help more.

Microsoft are in the same markets that Google makes a huge amount of money from and yet they failed on most fronts.<p>I think the safest way for Google to make money would be to not innovate or create any off the wall projects, and then just return the money the money to shareholders through dividends or share buybacks.<p>Just looking at the current stock price of Google $909 and Earnings per share of $33, this means that IF Google returned the entire earnings to shareholders it would take 27 years for the shareholders to get their money back and THEN after this 27 years they would start to get a return on their investment. This assumes no growth, and Google has grown significantly but there is no guarantee they will grow in the future. Even if they do grow significantly it will still take a very long time to get your investment back.<p>There are unknowns that could completely disrupt Google's business models for example what if all search became voice based (siri-like) with better AI.

Most people tend to be risk-averse, so they will never accept a 50/50 gamble (ref: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann%E2%80%93Morgenstern_utility_theorem"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann%E2%80%93Morgenstern...</a>). However, those in the startup space tend to be risk seeking, thus they are more inclined for the second option. Behaviorialists will point out this is a classic example of framing effect (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framing_effect_(psychology)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framing_effect_(psychology)</a>).

5432209,comment,5431842,5431874,11,0,uchi,,,"""Yet Windows Phone is a dismal failure even with Nokia's huge manufacturing bulk behind it. The only sensible conclusion I can come to is that making a desirable mobile OS is far more difficult than it appears, and that there are numerous 'below the water line' effects that make a mobile OS popular.""<p>I don't have any empirical data to back this up, but in my personal opinion a large reason why Windows Phone just isn't doing so well is because of brand association with 'Windows' and 'Microsoft'.<p>Microsoft's general appeal to the public is not one of hip and chic and new, which is what Windows Phone marketing has generally been about. Microsoft is associated with corporation and money and monopoly. The appeal of Windows OS to users is that people just use it and it works and sometimes it does things they don't understand and they get viruses and they get angry at it and they have to use Excel and Word. Even if Windows as a product is stellar the old moniker still lurks and it's very difficult to move away from that. People buy Windows because it's Windows. Good or bad. Doesn't matter. And Microsoft clearly has the OS marketshare muscle to force people onto Windows 8 despite it not being very favorable to many at all. Microsoft is just seen as an unappealing 'businessy' corporation for the general public. It doesn't at all attract the young or relatively middle aged chic users that it wants so hard. Windows is just seen as a business brand in general.<p>Apple already has a well known established brand and image, and Samsung is relatively faceless to the western market (and quite respected in the east) so much so that it can shape its brand image still (Going for the Apple look). Microsoft is simply just too well known to market Windows Phone as Windows Phone.<p>I honestly believe that if they just set up a different Mobile branch with a new name, rename Windows Phone to something else, and removed some of the ""Windowsy"" stickers on the Phone's OS, it would sell very very well. As an operating system the core apps work very well together and it's honestly better than Blackberry's and stands as a fair contender with Android in terms of polish. The only real problem is that it's just called Windows Phone.<p>That, and Microsoft just loves to drop support for older phones (2+ years old). That's a big no-no. Fucking over your already small userbase because you're churning out bigger and more powerful phones to go after the cash prize of young consumers does not bode well. It shows your greedy cunty side and will obviously detract already existing customers... which makes developers not so willing to make apps on your platform, however open and easy and inviting it may be. You are not Android. You do not offer the upgradability option like Android.<p>But unfortunately Microsoft's goal is to unify all of their products under a few 'key' Windows things. Skype is increasingly becoming more Microsofty and hotmail was turned into outlook. Neither of those things as brands are exactly super appealing. Microsoft is trying to centralize everything a la Google with it's wide plethora of apps and services while simultaneously creating a walled garden of windows only products like Apple.<p>When I think of outlook I think of being at work and dealing with business emails. I hate that. \nI don't want to tell you what I think about when I think of Internet Explorer.\nAssociating that with Windows Phone doesn't make me happy. I don't want to take my internet explorer experience with me on the go.<p>When I think of Android I think of an open platform and flexible. Google's default apps are very open and clean and simple. Chrome mobile is just primary colors and white and sharp with some text. It doesn't fuck around but it doesn't look businessy either. Same goes for the gmail app. The plethora of adequate white space between apps and their overall simple and clean design shapes Google's image as an open and simple company. In general, that's always been how Google has marketed itself and it's products. Windows is trying to copy that same design style to some degree in Windows Phone, but it just doesn't work. That's not the company's history.<p>Now, going back on topic. Samsung is going to spend a few years actually just making Tizen work as an OS and polishing it, unless they somehow hijack a lot of grunt developers overnight or something. iOS has gone through a lot of polish and testing and Android has taken years to work as well as it is currently today. Yes yes, TouchWiz <i>is</i> Android to many Samsung users. But under the hood Android does quite a bit more than what TouchWiz lets you believe. And there's lots of things that you only learn about once you let something loose in the wild.<p>Sleep deprived walltexts. I am sorry HN.",1364136874

I think that any competition should be judged by outsiders, if the competition cannot be accurately judged by outsiders then it is not a good competition.  For instance, a self driving car race can be judged by outsiders.<p>For #3 the accountability comes from the board of directors.  Right now the highest ranking professors are basically accountable to no one.  If a field starts to stagnate, get to esoteric, or close off to new ideas, there is no one with the power to get it unstuck.  The top professors do not have an incentive to get it unstuck, because they are the most successful in the status quo, their status is directly linked to the current direction of the field. An independent board of directors has no such perverse incentive.  Also, each institution would be actually independent, unlike with the grant system in which grants are centrally allocated by a network of the existing professors.  So if one institution goes the wrong direction, another institution might try and make its name by trying out a novel area of research.",1364136659

Of course you don't have to wait, you can pay full rate and then claim the difference, but that could take months.<p>If you create a SL, you must designate a legal administrator, and the cheapest way is being an ""autnomo"".<p>Edit: about creating a Ltd in the UK, if your revenues are more than 50% from Spain, you will be fined by the Spanish IRS for capital flight.

I leave the url prefix to the main application.<p><pre><code>    app.register_blueprint(comment, url_prefix='/comment')\n</code></pre>\nFor migrations, I prefer alembic to sql migrations - <a href=""https://alembic.readthedocs.org/en/latest/tutorial.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://alembic.readthedocs.org/en/latest/tutorial.html</a> I find Alembic simpler than SQLAlchemy(without compromising on power). Alembic can autogenerate migrations based on your model definitions. The way I work is I add a new model, and then run alembic to autogenerate the migration. Same goes for altering models.<p>For settings, I maintain setting.py, dev_settings.py, prod_settings.py. settings.py contains all the common settings. If environment is not defined, I do a `from dev_settings import *`, else I do a relevant import for the environment.<p>I also prefer having BEFORE_REQUESTS, AFTER_REQUESTS, MIDDLEWARES, LOG_HANDLERS, TEMPLATE_FILTERS, CONTEXT_PROCESSORS, ERROR_HANDLERS... in settings, and in main.py, call the relevant functions. That way, I don't have to hunt down the codebase. For blueprints, I define the same variables in __init__.py.<p>Model forms are another time saver(use wtforms, or preferably flask-wtform)<p><pre><code>    from flask.ext.wtf import Form\n    from wtforms.ext.sqlalchemy.orm import model_form\n    import models\n\n\n    PostForm = model_form(models.Post, models.db.session, Form, field_args = {\n        'name': {'validators': []},\n        'title': {'validators': []},\n        'content': {'validators': []},\n    })\n</code></pre>\nmodels.Post is flask-sqlalchemy model, models.db.session is sqlalcheymy session. You don't need to list all model fields for your model form. I find keeping models and forms in sync a pain. This way, I only keep the validations in sync(field_args isn't required - that's an example of adding validations).<p>I use flask-debugtoolbar for basic profiling and debugging. flask-webassets is awesome for managing assets and dynamic compilation. flask-script for writing manage.py jobs(python manage.py get_deps, python manage.py db_createall etc etc)",1364134629

Samsung is a huge company and just because one parts screws up doesn't mean, well, anything really.<p>But I guess I just had barely used any samsung devices that required software.  I can honestly not mention a single piece of samsung software or device that wasn't seriously hindered by the software. From TVs that show hideous grey bars (when the aspect ratio doesn't match) that will blind you in dark scenes (just because the TV frame is grey (note that you can't even change this in the menus)) instead of black bars like all other TVs, to well, TouchWiz...<p>Take the sound notification you got in samsung phones (was this around the time of galaxy SII? (and not the 90's that you'd expect))  where the phone would make a sound notification when the battery was charged to 100%. With no way to turn it off. I dare say the most common use case when charging a phone is during the night, a lot of people have their phone alongside their bed and this meant that they would be waken a few hours later.<p>All samsung devices with software in it has at least a few of these annoyances that makes it obvious - no one, has ever, used this thing outside of a lab.<p>But that's just small details.<p>TouchWiz is horribly slow. No, it really is catastrophically bad. I tested the Galaxy tab 10.1 in a few stores, in everyone the interface was seriously slower than any of the competitors (with the same hardware). But I figured that this was because of people installing and abusing demo devices. Then I was to help a friend with their brand new tab 10.1, I even witnessed the unpacking and out of the box and it was just as horrid as in all the stores. The brand new top of the line $500 tablet behaved as a bloated, cheap, first generation device. And it hasn't gotten better with time.<p>Samsung <i>completely ruined</i> the Galaxy S. Compare it to the Nexus S, pretty much the same hardware and the Galaxy S was by comparison barely usable unless you installed a custom rom on it. At which point it suddenly became a great phone.<p>The touchwiz calendar and messaging applications (in galaxy SIII) looks like they have been designed by a 10-year old starting to learn photoshop (seriously, I just can't believe my eyes everytime i use a Samsung android phone). The UI isn't even remotely consistent with... anything.<p>Everything they tweaked and touched has been for the worse. Yes they have their own features, mostly features that are fun the first five minutes (if you are a ten year old) but at best doesn't annoy you after the first week.",1364134280

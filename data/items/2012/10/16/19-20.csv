4661552,comment,4660544,4661188,6,0,Gravityloss,,,"When I used Matlab daily, I never used the ide. The command line and editor were good.<p>Matlab is awesome above all else because the design is coherent. Both the syntax and the standard libraries.<p>It is extremely quick to whip up anything and then turn that into a script and then into a software with functions (since functions can return many variables, and they also have zero overhead, you don't need any includes or requires, you just call them). Type conversions are practically never a problem, since they are sane and automatic. None of this 1+1.5 giving syntax error. Real booleans. Data input and output libraries just simply work like you would expect them to. ( A=imread('/home/gravityloss/abc.png') creates a width x height x 3 matrix with all the rgb values. No requires, includes, plugins, hunting and compiling libraries.).\nYou don't need libraries to do a huge amount of stuff, but if you need them for something experimental, they work extremely easily.<p>You also rarely need stuff like loops since mass operations on data are native. If you as a newbie create a custom function for a scalar, there's good chance it will work for vectors or n-matrices automatically. This reduces the amount of error-prone housekeeping code for indices and lengths immensely. It's also much much faster than some looping in another scripting language.\nAs a result, the code is often very readable as well.<p>There's help which actually returns something sensible when you type help, you can type help help or help command or search this or that, the help texts are actually very thoughtful and helpful too and not at all like Linux man pages... I could go on for hours on features that don't really exist anywhere else, even though everything's been in plain sight for decades in Matlab.<p>Julia's an awesome thing though, I hope it gets more traction...",1350417513

As I'm an immigrant here myself, I have a lot of friends that are also immigrants, although most are of the kind I discussed, working minimum wage for the Wal-Marts of the world. I can guarantee you, they send every penny they can spare to their family in their home country, and themselves live in second world conditions (10 to a house, eating rice for every meal, hand washing clothes, absolute minimum heat in the winter etc. etc.) so they are spending extremely little. A local person earning that same money would be spending/investing more.<p>2. These immigrants are earning $x, likely minimum wage. So they only at most $x to spend or invest. The employer would have had to increase wages to $x+y to attract a local, so that local would be spending or investing $x+y, which would be better for the economy.<p>Bringing in people to work for less money than a local person would do it only helps the company increase profit.",1350417061

I personally know recruiters at Microsoft, AOL, and Google, so they have provided me with some of my insight (note that each of these companies has very different hiring policies though), other things I get from news stories, comments (like or unlike my own!), so like any propaganda take it with a grain of salt.  From the instances I have seen, women are not only treated fairly (doing otherwise would be grounds for a lawsuit), but they are given special attention (I have seen more women greeted into tech with open arms than otherwise...males tend to <i>want</i> females in their male-dominated workplaces).  Again, just pointing out what I observe, not claiming to be the Oracle of Truth.  And actually, challenging social norms is a good thing.  We tend to think like sheep, which is a good reason we only have two significant political parties in the US.  It took somebody challenging my views for them to change (I hope for the better).",1350416567

Traditional factories will probably always be cheaper for mass-market goods, but there are likely to be lots of opportunities for niche-market goods that simply aren't economic under a big-scale factory model. Maybe even more importantly, the existence of 3d printing makes it easier to bootstrap a manufactured product -- you can start out 3d printed, and only go to big-factory-mode much later when demand dictates.<p>3.

In that sense, the default logic of economics in a politicised argument should not (IMHO) be deferred to [just because]. It should be viewed as critically as a political policy (ie Art, not 'Science'...its not objective etc).  And also debated thus and put into perspective also.<p>That's why many debates on immigration, etc get so far off track and/or are difficult to conclude with much progress. Folks conflating the two ideas and the standards of judgement, performance, opportunity cost, etc.<p>__________<p>On the substance of your point:<p><i>By not allowing companies to pay lower wages to foreign workers the wages of the local market is being protected.</i><p>The answer is yes, it is being protected.  But this is a normal thing. Also what is being protected is the political Atom of <citizenship>. This is not something that should, in general, be commoditized.  Thus, the ""permeability"" of the body politic (at the level of citizenry) is a legitimate debate, but its a political one, not a one-dimensional one in terms of wages/pricing etc.<p>So, to advance the debate, the question needs to be reframed a bit: what is the optimum level of social-permeability desired to grant title: citizen (or: greencarde, etc) for a nation state?  And the you have to address issues of other kinds.<p>For example, do you care more about well to do foreigners than your less well-off existing compatriots? This is sort of an empathy argument (vs. efficiency). And in part its a longer term argument (are citizens more efficient working with some safety net underneath them?)/etc.<p>Right now in the usa, ""merit"" is not really a big goal of immigration policy.  Can't say I agree with this, but the policy was revised to be more about human-right/family etc.  So, if you are an immigrant general labororer US citizen it might be you get your cousin a greencard.  But a regular no-strings PhD in astrophysics or whateve is not at any advantage vs the cousin of the general labourer (in fact just the opposite).<p>But family and the like is the ultimate sort of <i>political</i> argument.  On the one hand, its very emotional (for those involved). And on the other hand, their are very specific special interests at play (important, process wise).  So, you can see this is not something just totally possible to ignore, intellectually or practically.<p>Each country is different, though, in these ideas.

You do the complexity analysis and then assign it to a Big-O class, the Big-O class represents the worst-case for that given analysis.

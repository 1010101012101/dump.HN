6436035,comment,6430191,6435527,1,0,saraid216,,,"> ubiquitous surveillance is much closer to following everybody than noticing everybody<p>The issue is still that you&#x27;re likening surveillance to harassment more than you&#x27;re likening it to an intrusion of privacy. Based on this argument alone, I&#x27;m <i>less</i> inclined to agree with your position, because surveillance isn&#x27;t harassment.<p>> People&#x27;s instincts haven&#x27;t caught up with the reality that is presented by ubiquitous surveillance, so IMO the right way in this case to decide whether surveillance is acceptable is by analogizing to the closest available cultural and instinctive concept that is still fully functional.<p>You realize you&#x27;re not saying <i>anything</i> more than, &quot;I think it&#x27;s wrong, so I&#x27;m going to go searching for a rationalization,&quot; right?<p>I don&#x27;t disagree that the surveillance we can safely suspect is being done by governmental organizations is probably immoral and should be illegal, but what I&#x27;m not hearing is a solid, justified argument for your position other than, &quot;It&#x27;s icky.&quot; You don&#x27;t even have the fallback of &quot;everyone thinks it&#x27;s icky&quot; since by your own admission, people <i>don&#x27;t</i>.<p>I&#x27;m not interested in doing that hard philosophical work, personally, so I&#x27;ll leave you with a suggestion.

It is from this foundation that all other arguments about privacy are really built. So I&#x27;d challenge you to <i>show</i> that ubiquitous surveillance <i>necessarily</i> violates <i>everyone&#x27;s</i> dignity.<p>I think you&#x27;ll find that more difficult than you expect, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s impossible to come up with a reasonably sound proof.",1379997854

When I was in college in the 1980s and 90s, essentialism was a dirty word. To believe that males and females might be different in essential ways was akin to admitting that you were unenlightened. Theres still a pervasive sense in our culture that to be educated is to be gender-blind, and there is something of a taboo against voicing aloud explanations for a childs behavior in terms of his or her gender. If you dont believe me, try uttering some version of the following statements at your sons next parent-teacher conference: Jamal is so logical and brusque when he talks. I know he needs all our help to ease up. But these are traditional masculine behaviors, after all, and we might need to accept him more for who he is. Or, Billy overtalks and really needs an audience, especially when he has a new favorite hobby or interest. He needs to be a better listener. But hes not unlike a lot of boys I know.<p>Its this public discomfort with discussing childrens gendered behavior that gets many traditionally masculine boys inappropriately labeled as high-functioning autistic. Poor eye contact, long-winded monologues about ones new favorite topic, being overly serious and businesslike, appearing uninterested in others facial expressions, and restricting friendships to those who share ones interests, may all be signs of Aspergers syndrome or high-functioning autism. However, these same traits typify boys who are traditionally masculine in their behavior. Parents somehow have to ask the uncomfortable question in the doctors office: Is he high-functioning autistic or really a more masculine-identified boy?&quot;<p>Or...you know...a girl. Who just so happens to have strange interests, be introverted, and struggle socially.",1379996619

Calling it a spectrum provides great insight (there are a large number of behaviors, and individuals have various combinations of each to a varying degree), but the author uses it to blur the line between what I would call functioning and non-functioning individuals (and seemingly on purpose). &quot;Full&quot; autism causes people to be unable to cope with the regualar world and all its stresses (see article about how autistics can take an airplane[1]). The author is exploiting the fear of parents whose children are found to be on the &quot;autistic spectrum&quot; (but more likely on the more functioning Asperger&#x27;s end) and justifying a refusal of the diagnosis.<p>My perception is that Asperger&#x27;s individuals (and the William in the article seems to fit--though I am not a doctor) have quirks and are difficult to raise. They have emotional issues and are socially maladapted. But they can lead fully independent lives and often contribute greatly to society. My issue with the author is that I believe Asperger&#x27;s children can benefit greatly from psychological help, to teach them emotional and social skills in a way that parents can&#x27;t. I believe that in certain cases, this help is critical to making the difference between the Asperger&#x27;s person leading an almost normal life (including getting married and having kids), and leading a miserable life as a social outcast (bullied, unable to be in a relationship, unable to deal with child-raising).<p>So I think more nuance is in order, more distinction between autism and Asperger&#x27;s (even though they are on the same spectrum), and more help for Asperger&#x27;s children and adults, not less.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-23989422"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-23989422</a>",1379996552

It works in a way that doesn&#x27;t undermine local economics but instead infuses cash at the lowest levels of society, generating economic activity in local communities and providing opportunities for individuals to scale to small businesses and small businesses to scale into larger ones. One of the biggest takeaways for me was that except for major capital expenditures like power plants, ~12 million people spending ~$13 will better allocate ~$156 million dollars than one fund manager investing $156 million dollars. On top of that, a $10 million investment in Brazil is likely to be half of that after graft and palm greasing.<p>Read up on the Bolsa Familia. IMHO it&#x27;s really a model of how you institute a social program in a capitalistic way and the northeast is proof.<p>[0] nothing wrong with many ideas of socialism per se, but if you want socialism within your city/state/country, then you need to ruthlessly pursue capitalism with respect to other cities/states/countries that aren&#x27;t yours so you can fund your social programs.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolsa_Fam%C3%ADlia"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolsa_Fam%C3%ADlia</a>",1379996346

He tended to observe children playing with a parent for forty-five minutes or more, waiting for choice points to engage a child to determine if he or she was capable of more sustained eye contact, elaborate verbalizations, or shared emotional reactions. Dr. Greenspan believed that these conditions of safety and sensitive interaction were essential in order to obtain an accurate reading of a childs true verbal and social skills.&quot;</i><p>Here is he saying that we&#x27;re not spending <i>enough</i> time with children to make conclusive diagnoses, one way or the other.

The military was spreading chlamydia and radioactive materials in black neighborhoods &quot;just to see what would happen&quot;.  But I think considering the level of social consciousness AND technology that existed at the time, things were in many ways better.  More to the point, especially with regards to the discussion:  If you went to the hospital, your bills were reasonable - you wouldn&#x27;t go into debt, the quality of service (relative to what could be provided) was high.  If you were poor, you would probably be treated pro bono without hesitation.<p>If your claim is that the technology to save lives <i>really is that expensive</i>, I think you&#x27;re wrong.  Even the oft-repeated mantra that it&#x27;s rapacious insurance companies is a flawed narrative:  <a href=""http://biz.yahoo.com/p/5qpmu.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://biz.yahoo.com/p/5qpmu.html</a> (there are rapacious companies in there but it&#x27;s not insurance) and I would be deeply suspicious of whoever is selling that narrative.<p><i>&quot;the government&quot; as if it is something distinct</i><p>It is distinct.  If you wrong me, I cannot imprison you in my basement.  I cannot hire lackeys to invade your home and threaten you with guns and shoot your dog.  There&#x27;s a categorical difference.<p>>We, the voting American populace, are responsible for its actions.<p>No, we&#x27;re not.  If you &quot;voted for the other guy&quot;, in what way are you responsible?  For not trying hard enough?  If you&#x27;re opposed to the war, are you responsible because you didn&#x27;t go far enough to stop it?  How far would be enough?  Saying we are is kind of jingoistic.  Ultimately, we&#x27;re citizens of the planet, and any given person has a finite capacity to change it for the better; and expecting responsibility for more is unreasonable.<p>>If we wanted real change, there would be real change.<p>That&#x27;s true, but to get it we need to understand that government is NOT the solution to everything and think real hard about what it should and should not be a solution for.<p>>We are a selfish, violent people.<p>I don&#x27;t see this at all.  I think that perception is really a crazy media narrative caused by desperation from the disruption we&#x27;re seeing in that industry, and partly from (mostly local) government interest groups seeding that impression to justify increased expenditures for specialized crimefighting units.  Crime in the US is down over the last 20 years.<p>>Besides, the only system under which no one has influence over something I don&#x27;t want them to is a system in which I am an absolute monarch. Do you want that?<p>I&#x27;m not an galtian individualist - I&#x27;m not suggesting that my ideal is one where no one has influence over me.

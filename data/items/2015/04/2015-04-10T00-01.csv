9351992,comment,9351549,9351853,0,0,jerf,,,"At the moment, the most feasible way I see to the stars is via laser-launched ship. The cruel mistress that is the rocket equations don&#x27;t favor even a self-contained starship driven by 100% efficient antimatter reactions, to say nothing of things that might actually work. Leaving your engine behind is almost a necessity. But even if you try to launch things from a solar-system based laser station the physics still don&#x27;t really work out well. Light-years is a long way to maintain a focus for the beam.<p>Some have decided this means star travel is impossible; I say it just limits how quickly we can do it. We could launch very large ice asteroids with nanotech unmanned fusion stations that construct lasers (&quot;vigorous handwave about magic here&quot;) and create ourselves a series of stepping stones to a star. It would take a long time, not least of which is because we would also need to set up the &quot;stepping stones&quot; to stop us on the other end, too! But in theory it seems like it would &quot;just&quot; be a matter of time. Lots of time. But a whole star system on the other end! It&#x27;s a pretty big payoff for a strapping young Kardashev II civilization.<p>(Note that &quot;just send information&quot; only works <i>after</i> you deliver a physical package to the other end which would be capable of receiving it and doing something with it, and even nanotech is unlikely to be able to land anywhere to begin its lengthy self-replicating process to bootup civilization on the other end  if it&#x27;s merrily passing through a system at 80% the speed of light relative to the local rest frame.)<p>If you were lucky enough to stumble on to one of these planets in the way, it would provide a pretty nice shortcut to setting up your bridge by providing you a nice, huge power source (if you can find a lot of hydrogen lying around somewhere, which is a reasonable guess) that&#x27;s already more-or-less at rest in the galactic frame, allowing you to use it to relatively easily create more stages on the enormous pipeline, and allowing you the ability to relatively easily replenish the stages in the middle. (If that&#x27;s even desirable... perhaps the stages can be retargeted to other stars or something once the bootstrap package is successfully delivered.)<p>... of course, the article&#x27;s starting with &quot;10,000 years in the future&quot; is probably not a terrible guess about all this, as such things go. This is a guaranteed-slow process, trading time for space. Tell your great-grandchildren to ask their great-grandchildren how the initial plans to make the initial plans for all this are going, and say &quot;hi&quot; to the future for you. Saying &quot;we&quot; will do this might very well be considered to be rather impudent of me, much like Napoleon trying to claim some sort of perceptible credit for the Hoover Dam.",1428627191

9351990,comment,9351032,9351801,0,0,smacktoward,,,"That quote is a bit misleading when taken out of context.<p>Early in the war, there were a lot of conservative Northern Democrats who felt that, while crushing the rebellion was a valid war aim, going beyond that to emancipation of the slaves was not. They felt that insisting on emancipation would poison any chance of ever reintegrating the South into the Union. Since Lincoln was the first President ever elected by the then-new Republican party, which had a strong pro-emancipation faction, these conservatives tended to view Lincoln as a potentially dangerous radical whose ideology could potentially sabotage the war effort.<p>At the war&#x27;s opening Lincoln tended to agree with them. But a year of hard fighting that saw a string of Northern defeats changed his thinking. He began to feel that only by embracing a higher goal than political union could the North seize the moral high ground it would need to keep its people from giving up in frustration. So he slowly began to swing towards emancipation.<p>However, it was critical while he was making that swing that word of it not leak out, since if it was revealed prematurely, without the right buildup, it could shock the conservatives into bolting from the national unity coalition of Republicans and Democrats together that he had assembled at the start of the war. So even as he was drafting what became the Emancipation Proclamation, he was furiously insisting to anyone who asked that he intended nothing of the sort. (The quote you cited comes from an open letter Lincoln wrote during this period to a prominent conservative New York newspaper editor named Horace Greeley as part of this PR effort -- see <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/1862/08/24/news/letter-president-lincoln-reply-horace-greeley-slavery-union-restoration-union.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/1862/08/24/news/letter-president-linc...</a>)<p>It worked, at least as well as it needed to work; while the conservatives never really trusted Lincoln, they couldn&#x27;t ever pin him down on the slavery issue either. And by the time he revealed his shift, it was clear to everyone that the conservatives&#x27; dream that the South could be reconciled with sweet words and restraint was a fantasy -- the South was in earnest, they were playing for keeps, and the only way they would be brought back into the union was with fire and sword.",1428627143

9351977,comment,9351032,9351873,0,0,tolmasky,,,"The question of slavery seems quite orthogonal to government. It was, after all, the United States government that codified and made slavery law in the first place. It was, after all, the southern governments that subsidized slave owners costs through police enforcement (by catching slaves), and courts (Dred Scott v. Sandford anyone?). It would arguably be quite difficult to have functioning slavery without it being subsidized (its usually cheaper just to pay people to do the work, unless someone else is paying to keep them in line).<p>At the end of the day, the government is just the people. I don&#x27;t &quot;blame&quot; the government for slavery in America anymore than I &quot;congratulate&quot; them for ending it. People at one point wanted it and thus the government unfortunately reflected that, and at a later point stopped wanting it and thus the government reflected that. Just look at your own interpretation here: it relies entirely on the historical accident that the north won. Had the south coincidentally won instead, which would have had little to do with which side was &quot;right&quot;, would you think government <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> work? Military force this time around thankfully was on the side of good, doesn&#x27;t seem in any way guaranteed however.<p>Not to mention the ways government continues to support slavery. It was only 50 years ago that we were interning the Japanese. And if you read the 13th amendment, you&#x27;ll notice a peculiar exception: &quot;except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted&quot;.

Not to mention Application Verfier.<p>I could keep going on and on but it&#x27;d probably cloud my point if I haven&#x27;t done so already :)<p>Not saying it&#x27;s perfect or the be-all-and-end-all either; I also use all three major OSs, though primarily develop .NET software on Windows.

9351836,comment,9350626,9351223,0,0,MaulingMonkey,,,"> My negativity here is NOTHING compared to the negativity and resentment by the professor in the article, who cloaks it in positive language.<p>Please note you&#x27;re assuming the worst of people, and appear to me to be choosing to give no benefit of the doubt.  Would you be willing to reconsider doing this?  At least for a moment?<p>> On the other hand, he is advocating for a Cult of Computer Science with specially designed courses for different races of people.<p>I read the exact opposite into what she&#x27;s saying: That we <i>have</i> specifically designed courses for white males (that happen to be open to all) and should consider mixing the design up to better serve a broader range.<p>I base this partly on the fact that she <i>specifically attacks</i> the idea of racial segregation that you seem to think she&#x27;s suggesting in the intro:<p>>> Throughout history, and even today in certain parts of the world, attitudes like this have been the basis for keeping entire segments of the population uneducated (“teaching women to read and write?! seriously, they can’t do it, look how much longer it takes for them to learn” or “blacks in Universities?! seriously, they can’t do it, look how their grades are so much lower”). This is basically the attitude of a class of educators who live so much inside the box of convention and intellectual lazyness that they are uncapable of seeing the big picture.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, I would call this negativity.  I certainly wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if there&#x27;s some resentment there:  I&#x27;d certainly be resentful if someone scoffed at teaching <i>me</i> how to read and write!  I would call it uncloaked negative language.<p>But, in all these things, it seems to be <i>against</i> segregation, not <i>for</i> it!<p>On the topic of learning styles:  What I&#x27;ve read hasn&#x27;t mentioned much about race or sex.  I believe that we all - even as individuals, regardless of race or sex - use multiple styles, and that we <i>all</i> can benefit from multiple approaches.  I certainly don&#x27;t always get everything, and having an explanation re-framed in a new way - in a new style, one might say - gives me another opportunity to understand.<p>I think, at worst, she meant to appeal to our sense of fairness and equality by borrowing - perhaps awkwardly - by tying it to the civil rights movement.  I&#x27;m skeptical at best about how relevant sex or race is.  I&#x27;m not willing to crucify her over that though.",1428624505

For example, your claim of exponential complexity was not just a matter of hyperbole, you backed it up with an explanation: &quot;...because you need to either stick to one specific implementation of one specific language runtime, or you have to deal with explaining them all.&quot; If that is no longer your position, say so, and we can move on.<p>Another recurring factual claim is that there is a set of people that will understand this issue only if it is presented in a very specific way. Putting aside, for the moment, the question of how well that worked out in practice, let&#x27;s look at what characteristics you have ascribed to your target: 1) They didn&#x27;t get it as presented in the original article; 2) They have read what the JLS says about it, but did not understand it there; 3) They could not be led, through a suitable explanation, to follow what the JLS says; 4) Any explanation based on computing basics would be beyond their grasp; 5) Despite all this, they understand (and not just think they understand) the more complex issue of argument-passing in C++. It seems unlikely there is anyone in this set. In particular, while there seem to be people in group 3, I doubt any of them have made it into group 5.<p>As for an alternative explanation, we have, for example, eslaught&#x27;s post:

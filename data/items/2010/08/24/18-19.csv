Which means you need someone who grasps both the tech and business side of things. And if someone fits into that category why would they work for someone-else's startup for a relatively small wage rather than working for a more profitable company (higher pay; more security) or starting their own company ? - essentially offering significant equity is the only way to hire these people.

1630720,comment,1630201,1630639,0,0,cscotta,,,"Apologies for not publishing the EC2 Small number in the original post. It was 120,000 for the pure Java NIO implementation, but I'd like to explain a bit more on that one.<p>We hit 120k clients at the time the process was killed by the kernel, but had about 500mb free memory left when the OOM kill occurred. Here's why (and please correct me if I'm mistaken - I'm not a kernel expert, but have done a lot of reading in this area over the past couple months):<p>Small EC2 instances are restricted to running a 32-bit kernel.  The 32-bit Linux kernel (2.6 series) allocates memory into three zones, with the first and smallest slot reserved for DMA (~16mb), the next portion reserved for kernel functions (""low memory"", ~896mb), and the rest allocated as ""high memory"" for userspace. There are very limited options to configure this allocation, aside from recompiling and maintaining a custom kernel for our purposes, which we do not want to do. The Hugemem kernel allocates low memory differently, but is no longer being actively recommended (that I can see), and only makes sense for servers with > 4GB anyway.<p>Because TCP sockets are allocated in low memory, and its size is relatively fixed, 120k sockets will exhaust low memory despite about 500mb of high memory being free and unallocated. At this point, the kernel has no memory left allocated to itself to do work, so the OOM killer steps in and shoots the process.<p>The 64-bit kernel makes no distinction between ""low"" and ""high"" memory, and does not suffer this problem. We switched to an EC2 Large instance in order to avoid this limitation and properly test the service. In the end, if Amazon were to offer a 64-bit Small instance, it would be ideal for our application and would push our cost per client even lower, though it's currently at a very acceptable spot.<p>While the metrics in this post focus on connections per node, our ultimate goal involves both maximizing the number of connections per instance, in addition to minimizing the number of instances required (essentially, we want to [safely] maximize density across the board). The sentence you quote refers to this cumulative goal rather than the particular comparison of implementations and instance types. I should've been more clear.<p>Anyhow, pardon this omission from the original post. At some point, I might write a bit more about the TCP/kernel-level issues we ran into if anyone's interested.",1282675880

That is the person who will be there when times get tough and sacrifice is required. It is the person who will <i>not</i> dart out the door, or dodge responsibility, when something has gone wrong and people have to step up to take responsibility. It is the person who will respect you as a co-worker, who will take a personal interest in knowing that you are well, who will sympathize when you share a problem, who will support you through your trials - I am not talking here about one who is a close friend but rather of the traits exemplified by one who has a loving, kind spirit that is ever alert to show concern for the welfare of others and who is willing to sacrifice for the good of larger aims besides immediate self-interest.<p>That is what I think of when I think of working with ""unselfish colleagues.""

If you take their average CR, it'll be something atrocious (not as bad as 1:200, but bad nonetheless), but it makes no difference for those 10% of marketers. My point is that industry averages don't mean anything. It comes down to how good a marketer you are.<p><i>I know the mechanics of the industry...nothing can actually convert at 1:10.</i><p>Then we are in different industries.<p><i>ESPECIALLY if you do ppv and media buys like you say.</i><p>80% of my traffic generation is via media buys, 18%-19% via ppc and 1%-2% via ppv.<p><i>Hell...most products don't have 1:10 conversions for the actual order form.</i><p>Again, this comes down to the marketer. If that's all you can pull in with your landing page and copy, then that's all you can pull.<p><i>So you are going to tell me your colleagues are converting at 1:5 for an ebook product? How about 1:1?</i><p>1:1? No. 1:5? Yes. But they care more about the CPC and EPC than the CR.<p><i>the only way you can actually get 1:10 conversion rates...is if you do VERY targeted CPC...which usually means you are getting low volume(which explains the 40 cents CPC).</i><p>Of course I laser target my CPC, only a newb marketer wouldn't. But while low volume = low CPC, the inverse isn't necessarily true. It comes down to the marketer - a newb will pay $5 CPCs but an experienced one can get high volume traffic at a 10th of that price.<p><i>How many actual sales do you have every month at that 1:10 conversion rate?</i><p>Here are my numbers for July (rounded from memory) -<p><pre><code>  price of ebook - $8\n  visitors - 71,000\n  CPC - $0.40\n  expense - $28,400\n  CR - 10.9%\n  buyers - 7700\n  revenue - $62,000\n  EPC - $0.87\n</code></pre>\nMy advice is still the same - try not blanket everyone in a niche with your experiences or the avg #s for that niche. There's a reason why 90% of marketers barely make any profit and see dismal CRs and EPCs. It's because the rest of the 10% take everything (ever hear of 'Truth About Six Pack Abs'? that ebook's author used to net over $500,000 a day while the majority of the marketers in the health/exercise niche were barely breaking even.)",1282673965

1630615,comment,1629951,1629951,0,0,todayiamme,,,"I honestly believe that this is the difference between Apple and the rest of the competition. You see, the secret they have to their products is that they realize that most people don't have any idea whatsoever what the hell a frikkin' mp3 file is. Neither do they know the difference between lossy and lossless conversion. They are intimidated  by all those fancy buttons on the screen and are too scared to try anything just in case they break something.<p>Steve Jobs recognizes this and that's his genius in a way. So, instead of creating a widget that does everything they choose to make a widget that does everything the user wants. There's a subtle, but important difference over here. Only a small subset of their users want extensive options so that they can put FLAC and other stuff onto it. Those are the users who fret about the product to the nth degree and they know that they don't exist to serve <i>them</i>.<p>So, they pick a feature and implement it in a way that those other users (80%+ of the market) know how to use it, and that makes all the difference. Just look at enterprise software and how hideously broken it is. You have SaaS that try to do everything at once which directly results in their users doing nothing at once. This instead causes grumbling against the software and in the longer turn your sales go down. The hardest lesson in business, I think, is learning how to bite the bullet. No one wants to admit that their software can't do something. So, they rush and put the feature in to satisfy themselves without checking if it works or not. Big mistake. What's worse is that it is so ingrained in us that we don't even realize what damage we have done.<p>What I am trying to say is that it's perfectly fine to not have the insanely great feature X, but it's inexcusable that the user has to read a 300 page manual to use feature X.<p>This is why I suggest everyone to read the Apple Human Interface guidelines. They aren't perfect, but they've gotten quite a few things right.

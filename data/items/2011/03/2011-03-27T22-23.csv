I wouldn't be planning to study for a PhD in Neuroscience and researching assistive brain/spine implants. I wouldn't study programming languages and designs. I wouldn't be reading The Intelligent Investor. In fact, if you lived for the now, you'd probably be living in a soma-induced haze  la Huxley's Brave New World: it'd be the optimal choice, in fact. Pure neurochemical bliss.""<p>Living for the now doesn't mean being a dopamine junkie.<p>I went to college knowing that it was basically useless for what I wanted to do with my life.  I went because it was time - all the adults around me said that I'd be missing out on an awesome experience if I didn't, and while I was a little skeptical, I figured I'd give it a try.  That, and the economy was about to enter the shitter (it was 2001), and the company I was working at was about to lay off 40% of its workforce.<p>I majored in physics because I liked the feeling of sitting out on my roof with sunshine on my face (yeah, New England, it didn't last very long), textbook in my lap, working on really hard math problems.  As it turned out, I didn't like it enough to stick with it.  I then majored in computer science because I had found out that I liked it enough to spend my weekends working on compilers and my late nights reading up on programming language design.  At the time I did those, I was a physics major, and they were completely irrelevant to anything that might possibly advance my degree or career.  But they were fun.<p>I read The Intelligent Investor because I'd just started working at a financial software startup, had an hour long commute, and figured it might be more fun to figure out what I'd just gotten myself into rather than stare at the silent faces on the train.  As it turned out, after reading The Intelligent Investor I didn't much like what I'd gotten myself into at all, which is why I'm not in finance now.<p>In one of Paul Graham's essays, he says that you can tell an adult from a child because an adult will tend to ""lean into"" challenges, accepting them as part of who they are instead of shrinking back from them.  There's nothing that prevents you from building the habit of leaning into challenges into your daily identity.  It doesn't particularly matter what those challenges are, it matters that you attack them.  If you build this habit, you'll usually do fairly well even if you don't make a master plan for your life.  Heck, you'll probably do better than people who do create a master plan, because life has a way of biting you in the ass and tearing your plans to shreds.",1301266355

His argument is that it's better that inflationary investing is happening in private markets, and while that's true for the general public, I'd still say that that has no impact on whether or not we're in a bubble.  If there is a bubble, and it does pop, that would be very bad for the HN crowd.  The fact that VCs and investment bankers would be losing most of the money doesn't change the fact that a whole lot of devs will be out of work, and there will be a few lean years of funding for people trying to launch.  In fact, for just about anyone who cares whether or not there's a tech bubble, its existence would be bad.

He quotes Apple's legal papers in which they clearly state that the concept of an app store is unprecedented and then he exposes that as inaccurate. You might think of him as a ""minor freetard business celebrity"" but he took the brilliance of Linux software repositories, made them easier to use and more accessible, and integrated in the ability to pay for software long before Apple did the exact same thing. That makes him extremely qualified to offer some insight on the topic regardless of how big of a celebrity he is. It also explains why he focuses on countering Apple's claim that they invented the concept despite it being less relevant to the trademark dispute.<p>He was also involved with the Microsoft v. Lindows case in which Microsoft claimed to own the trademark on all words that rhyme with Windows. Remember that one? Where Microsoft couldn't win so they ended up paying $20 million to Lindows for them to change their name to Linspire? He's had direct experience with a frivolous trademark suit from a major software company in the past. Again, that makes him highly qualified to share an opinion on the current situation, which he does. He directly addressed the fact that that app store had been in common usage before Apple started using it. It would've been nice if he could have given more concrete examples but he did still address it.<p>In conclusion, calling him a freetard is childish and contributes nothing to the discussion of the article. Saying that he fails to distinguish trademarks from patents is flat out wrong and gives people skimming the comments a totally inaccurate impression of the article and its relevance.",1301265606

You will see it on school playgrounds, you will see it with friendships & you will see it in the professional world. This leads you to be distrusting of the smile. I smile, you smile, but it doesn't really break the ice because I don't know who you really are or what your motives are. I may see you smiling & shaking hands with the person you were just bitching about ten minutes ago. Again more distrust.<p>Reading & listening beyond the obvious expression may be more valuable than just taking it at ""face value"".<p>That said, the smile is probably more useful as a default than a glower or frown. At least it does seem to present a willingness to open dialog. People are more likely to approach someone who is smiling at them, than someone who is sending them an icy look.",1301263315

8540799,comment,8537390,8539773,0,0,mikeash,,,"The Russians put stuff into orbit relatively cheaply, but not by a huge margin. Building the same rocket over and over again has worked out OK for them, but it hasn&#x27;t dramatically reduced the cost of access to space.<p>The landing fuel for SpaceX&#x27;s design is the same fuel as used to launch. A reusable Falcon 9 launch will have 30% less payload capacity than an expendable one, because of the need to save fuel for the landing. But the cost savings will be <i>vastly</i> more than 30%. So overall it&#x27;s a big net win.<p>SpaceX isn&#x27;t man-rated yet. They don&#x27;t yet have a spacecraft that can carry people, so there&#x27;s no point. That&#x27;s being worked on, of course. The Dragon 2 spacecraft that will carry people includes a launch escape system, so it will be much more tolerant of launch mishaps than the Shuttle was, where the options for surviving a serious failure on launch were pretty much just &quot;pray.&quot;<p>Turnaround costs and reentry shielding actually illustrate just how different SpaceX&#x27;s approach is from the Shuttle&#x27;s. They&#x27;re only reusing the first stage for now. That means that there&#x27;s no real need for a thermal protection system, so no worries with tiles. The engines are stressed a lot less, so they break less. The engines are also much less efficient (which is to say much less fragile) than the Shuttle&#x27;s, and should need no refurbishment for subsequent launches. They&#x27;re looking at reusing the capsules as well, but the heat shielding on those is tiny compared to what a Shuttle needed. They&#x27;re not currently looking to reuse the second stage at all, but of course the rocket equation tells us that reusing the first stage is a much bigger deal. Just reusing the first stage gets you 90% of the cost savings of reusing everything.",1414785575

8540795,comment,8538208,8540620,0,0,delluminatus,,,"No way man, that&#x27;s such a square question, it&#x27;s not about <i>specifics</i>, it&#x27;s about <i>generalities</i>.<p>Ahem. That was a joke. But in seriousness, I&#x27;ve also never heard a specific example of a programming problem solved during a trip, but I can say that I&#x27;ve found tripping to be very beneficial in some unexpected areas:<p>1. Holistic understanding feels easier. E.g. understanding other people on a much deeper holistic level. I&#x27;m usually not very great at group socializing in parties or whatnot but tripping actually helps with that a lot. This is, in my mind, the same kind of &quot;systems understanding&quot; that could be applied to programming. You can intuitively understand a complex system of subtle interactions, on a deeper level than just what&#x27;s being said.<p>2. Visualization. Almost anything can be visualized, even if it doesn&#x27;t really make sense. And the visualizations feel <i>real</i>, which makes them easier to move and comprehend. Sometimes you can literally see them, like in the patterns of the veins on your hand, or the stitching in your clothes.<p>3. Unexpected mutation. During a trip, things can often move in a weird way, including things that don&#x27;t normally move, like concepts or diagrams (or walls -- just try not to stare at them too long). It&#x27;s notoriously challenging to rotate, skew, or otherwise transform your mental visuals. Tripping can make this trivial.<p>4. Perceived reality. The difference between real and virtual completely fades. Video games feel <i>real</i> (which is awesome when it&#x27;s not terrifying). Have you ever played an FPS where you are literally afraid to die? It actually makes you a lot better! This same perceptive shift collapses the difference between real/virtual, digital/analog (in the nontechnical sense), practical/theoretical. It collapses inside/outside as well. You are not separate from what you are doing or thinking about; you&#x27;re <i>part of the system</i>, like you&#x27;re literally contained within the conceptual structure. This kind of dichotomy-destroying mindset opens up some very interesting new perspectives.",1414785539

Your business can also contribute up to 25% (or 20% if you&#x27;re a sole proprietor) of its profit as a profit-sharing contribution.

After accident reviews \nnearly always note that the system has a history of prior â€˜proto-accidentsâ€™ that nearly \ngenerated catastrophe.<p>> 17) People continuously create safety.<p>> Failure free operations are the result of activities of people who work to keep the system \nwithin the boundaries of tolerable performance. These activities are, for the most part, \npart of normal operations and superficially straightforward.

8540481,comment,8536686,8540008,0,0,saurik,,,"OK, at some point I see they started adding AppleWebKit/# to the User-Agent. On a device running iOS 6.1, I am seeing &quot;536.26&quot;. In WebCore.framework it reports &quot;6536.26&quot; (at some point they dropped the leading &quot;6&quot; from versions).<p>It looks to just be missing the final version component, as even versions of iOS 6.0.x have that same version. So, I went and got the code from opensource.apple.com and started bisecting for the version... the code is totally different.<p>I don&#x27;t think you understand the situation here: the iOS version of WebCore is not developed in public, and lots of parts of it are redacted. Even in the code dumps from Apple on opensource.apple.com, some of the code is a .a file.<p>To demonstrate this, as maybe it still isn&#x27;t clear what is going on, Apple released iOS 6.0 in September of 2012. Apple released the source code for the iOS 6.0 version of WebCore, and it includes a special &quot;platforms/ios&quot; folder.<p>This folder contains files like ClipboardIOS.h. If we look in the WebKit source code repository, this file did not get &quot;upstreamed&quot; until May of 2013. You simply can&#x27;t tag something if it isn&#x27;t even in the source code repository.<p><a href=""http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/150049"" rel=""nofollow"">http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/150049</a><p>(Interestingly, when Apple did finally provide this source code, they also provided the corresponding ClipboardIOS.mm: they did not on opensource.apple.com, and instead provided ClipboardIOS.o as part of libWebCore_armv7.a.)",1414782002

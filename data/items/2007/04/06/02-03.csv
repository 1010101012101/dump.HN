I know a few people or friend-of-a-friend.<p>But what are the better and cheaper web teplate design companies out there?",1175828314
9495,comment,9172,9304,0,0,BrandonM,,,"Oh, I totally get that.  The ""problem"" is that of building languages on top of Lisp, which is really half of the point.  The languages that can be trivially built on top of Lisp generally look like Lisp.  I would like to be able to use a language with Lisp's capabilities to build a new language which looks completely different.<p>I'm not really asking for an answer here; this is really just a thought exercise on my part that I thought I'd share.",1175828309
9494,comment,9348,9348,0,0,BrandonM,,,"I find that even though my desktop environment is geared toward productivity (i.e. I can switch quickly between vi, the shell, firefox, etc), I actually get more work done from on campus when I VNC to home.  That is, I waste less time doing things like reading random posts on this site, and actually do what I set out to do.  Even now, I have a homework assignment due in about 10 hours that I can't bring myself to work on.<p>So I must agree that at least having some sort of separate workspace must help somehow.  I think the real root problem, however, is to layout a schedule for yourself and follow it.  Going to an office forces you to do that; writing a schedule down and being committed to following it could feasibly accomplish the same goal.<p>Note to self: make a schedule.",1175827788

9492,comment,9492,9398,0,0,voiceofreason,,,"How DARE you call me a liar?  You work in a PR firm, so you use WORDS.  I use LOGIC.<p>The point of my thread was that the author was being a jerk to Paul and should apologize.  When I posted the quote where it's clear the author is insulting Paul, you got all uppity about it.<p>""your initial comment said that the author should apologize for comparing Paul to the musician.""<p>At what point did I deny that I ""compared Paul to the musician?""  I never claimed I never said that.  I simply replied to you and posted his quote you might have missed where the author said ""YC is a waste of time"" and also says, Paul is a bull who speaks ""shit"".  That's why I said the author should apologize.<p>The author obviously meant to say Steve instead of Paul, in the intro.  I didn't confuse that part of the article like you arrogantly believed.  The reason I compared the two is because the user shows disdain and hate for the YC, so much he even confused his friend and Paul's names, when the two had nothing to do with one another.<p>You work in public relations so you're probably very good at attacking people.  You're a liar and exaggerate by trade.<p>Do you understand it now?  Or are you attacking me just because you're a PR person trying to test your training?",1175827660
9491,comment,9361,9371,0,0,BrandonM,,,"This is exactly what I got from the article, and I totally agree with you that the headline is malformed.  What it boils down to is that you should not be waiting for YC funding in order to begin work on your startup.  Just work on it when you can, put something interesting together, grow it slowly (i.e. over a period of months instead of some huge launch), and go full-time when the opportunity presents itself.<p>I also have to agree with the others that the writer of the article kind of missed the point of the environment and guidance that YC provides.  But then again, perhaps some of the applicants are only applying because they think they need the money.",1175827444

9489,comment,9348,9473,0,0,brett,,,"I'd agree. The more environments you can work in the better, but often will power is as much about being smart enough to give yourself the ambient conditions you need to succeed as it is about just mandating how you are going to behave. <p>This only goes so far though. Daniel's probably right that you're in trouble if you require <i>another person</i> to motivate you to do work, but I don't think that's what you meant in the first place. ",1175826963

9486,comment,9361,9361,0,0,richcollins,,,"I was rejected by YC for the 2006 WFP.  I created an app with no funding that didn't make any money, but gave me credibility.  As a result, my current (new) project is funded.  If it had kept looking for funding instead of just building something, I probably would have given up long ago.<p>The true ethos of a hacker lies in building stuff.  If you get rejected, just keep building stuff!\n",1175825811

9484,comment,9171,9475,0,0,andreyf,,,"""Some simply like the control, autonomy and culture of a startup.""<p>Will people really get the opportunity for that, though? If the idea isn't ""theirs"" in the sense that it was (more or less) handed to them as something to work on for you, will they feel the same freedom to change or modify it as they would with their own startup? And isn't that flexibility a necessary component for a startup's success?<p>It's a delicate psychological issue... as students, we've been very much conditioned to respond to an authority figure (teacher, boss), and  if you don't want to fall into that role, you should be consciously careful not to.",1175825683

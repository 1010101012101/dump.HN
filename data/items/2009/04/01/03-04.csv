Right now with CouchDB, there's no bult-in partitioning, so if you want to distribute documents across databases on multiple host systems, you use some sort of reverse proxy to distribute requests across hosts or application level database sharding.  Both of these approaches are currently used by folks scaling out things like MySQL.",1238558076

541322,comment,541143,541254,0,0,znbailey,,,"We use it where I work and the designers like it a lot. It works very well to build cross-browser layouts in a very quick and simple manner and has drastically reduced the amount of time it takes them to cut PSDs into raw XHTML/CSS.<p>One downside you will quickly notice is your markup becomes much less semantic and a lot more cluttered with CSS classes. This is simply by virtue of how all ""grid"" CSS frameworks like this work - they set up a ton of generic styles that are impossible to be symanticized. With blueprint you start to see a lot of classes that look like ""span-XX last"" or ""push-XX"" or ""pull-XX"".<p>There are a number of ways to get around this, however. The first is a tool that comes with blueprint that lets you set up a yml configuration which maps semantic ids to these generic CSS classes. For instance you can say ""#footer => span-24 last"". This will then generate the CSS in a semantic manner so you can continue using id references in your XHTML.<p>The second way, and this is the approach that I would highly recommend, is to go ahead and use some sort of CSS metalanguage/compilation tool such as SASS (Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets - <a href=""http://haml.hamptoncatlin.com/docs/rdoc/classes/Sass.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://haml.hamptoncatlin.com/docs/rdoc/classes/Sass.html</a>). Chris Eppstein has done a fantastic job with the Compass CSS Framework (<a href=""http://wiki.github.com/chriseppstein/compass"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.github.com/chriseppstein/compass</a>) which builds on top of SASS, which allows you to do really amazing things with CSS.<p>The compass framework he has built allows you to do things like define CSS constants (colors, font sizes, etc), perform unit arithmetic, as well as define abstract classes or groups of properties called ""mixins"" which allow you to abstract out a lot of your repetitive CSS properties. It is also a whitespace sensitive DML which makes the highly nested nature of CSS selectors a breeze to work with. It also already comes with modules for blueprint and other grid frameworks!<p>I would check out his talk about it here if this sounds interesting to you:<p><a href=""http://pivotallabs.com/talks"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pivotallabs.com/talks</a><p>HTH!",1238557305

In mid-year, Ford apparently decided to change the design on the door lock actuator.  So, I blindly found a part that was supposed to be for my model year, and it turned out to be wrong.  I'd love to have a ""forum topic"" in the vein of what you're proposing.  I'm imagining a decision tree with places for people to comment, add photos, links, etc.  It ought to have Wikipedia-like community categorization.  There should be a topic for ""My Ford Explorer's door lock doesn't work"" which would walk through diagnostic steps along with part identification/repair procedures.  People post stuff like this to automotive forums all the time, so it's no stretch to think that they would add their knowledge to the tree as well (with attribution to encourage ownership).<p>I like the idea a lot.  Forums are a sloppy hammer used to attack community problems that are sort of like nails.<p>From a monetization standpoint, you can't do much better than a ""how to fix X"" forum since most repairs involve the purchase of parts/tools.  And, you'll know exactly which parts people likely need depending on where they are in the decision tree.  So, you ought to get really good click-thru rates for advertising.",1238556714

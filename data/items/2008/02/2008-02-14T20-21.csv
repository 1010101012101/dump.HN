116068,comment,115909,116007,0,0,youngnh,,,"C-M-\ actually only indents the 'region', which is the text between the point (your cursor) and the mark (C-Space). The neat thing about this is that yank (C-y) automatically sets the point and the mark at opposite sides of the yanked text. After copying an expression written in the slime repl to a buffer, C-M-\ works without having to move your cursor to the beginning of the expression.",1203022550

116064,comment,115800,116049,0,0,fiaz,,,"But the fact that other quality links can be liberally up-voted by others would prevent low quality links from rising.  The only advantage I can see with the down-voting is that it will make (subjectively) quality links rise faster and poor links sink faster - but this is not necessarily an advantage, at least I don't think it is (I could be TOTALLY missing your point here!).",1203022306

116059,story,,,1,3,epall,"Ask.YC: task management software? ",,"I have been using Llama Graphics' Life Balance (http://www.llamagraphics.com/LB/index.php) for a couple of years now, but in that time they have made one minor update and asked me for $50 on top of the $70 I already paid. With a buggy, unintuitive interface and glacial development times, I think it's time to retire Life Balance.<p>What solutions do you use for keeping track of tasks across different parts of your life? My favorite feature of LB is the ability to subdivide every task into smaller ones, creating a task tree with priorities assigned to every node. The software then does some simple multiplication and traversal to give me a prioritized task list based on what I've put in. Is there something out there that would allow me to do this and access the information from both my Mac and Treo?",1203021711

If you need to hire people (or are desperate to get funded or acquired ;-), then said startup-hub is important.  If you have a way of bootstrapping on your own (""I only bus tables as a day-job; I'm <i>really</i> an actor^Wstartup founder!""), and a plan for getting actual revenue, then don't overlook the potential of a certain global computer network that can reach across borders much more easily than you can.",1203021508

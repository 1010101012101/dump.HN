It&#x27;s on a scale that&#x27;s hard to imagine.<p>&quot;Is there something I&#x27;m missing as far as where its clearly deficient to a standard large scale farm?&quot;<p>* The cost of the land/building/facilities is going to be substantial, and would get much much worse if you try to do this at a scale that would even barley put a dent into the food production system. This gets far worse if you want to put them in urban areas to reduce transportation costs.<p>* It would take a great many years to achieve a scale that would change anything, even if the costs work out(which as I said earlier, I highly doubt).<p>* Any business model revolving around this idea will be under dire threat of any cost optimization/wins on the open air large scale farms. For a metaphor, take a look at the multitude of solar start-ups that went into the market thinking X cost-per-watt was competitive only to have chinese panels drop by 30% in a year, immediately putting them under(see solyndra). This technique can&#x27;t just be competitive, it has to destroy open-air farming in terms of cost in order to be safe enough to place a bet on it big enough to change anything.<p>* I would like to see some solid research on the affects of artificial light on plants. Nutritional changes, in particular.<p>Don&#x27;t get my wrong, I am into technological solutions, I just don&#x27;t see this panning out.

Things like smart crop selection based on data from projected weather patters and market conditions, crop cycle planning to better respond to water/market/field conditions, accurate yield prediction allowing better financial planning, etc.\n* GMO&#x27;s that do something else other than allowing a farmer to douse a field in round-up or making a plant produce it&#x27;s own pesticide.\n* The commoditization and expansion of &quot;modern&quot; farming technology to the various 3rd world countries.",1421099777

8876671,comment,8876445,8876445,0,0,7Figures2Commas,,,"Can talking to corporate development be a huge distraction? Sure. But talking to investors can be a huge distraction as well, and a lot of the things that PG writes about corporate development folks are true of investors. Is PG next going to suggest that startups avoid the Sand Hill Road dog and pony show? I don&#x27;t think so.<p>Broadly-speaking, investors today are overvauling startups. Seven figure valuations and ridiculous convertible deals are being handed out like candy to early-stage companies with way more potential than proof. It&#x27;s a hot market and investors want dealflow, so they&#x27;re not quibbling. There&#x27;s also a greater fool dynamic at play.<p>This in turn leads founders to believe that their companies are worth more than they really are. In many cases, the &quot;surprisingly low&quot; acquisition offers these companies might receive are only &quot;surprisingly low&quot; when viewed through the lens of the angel and VC environment. On their own, they might be quite reasonable.<p>The big challenge for founders is that a high valuation can be a friend made enemy. It&#x27;s great to raise a bunch of cash on favorable terms, but lots of companies will eventually fail to live up to their valuations. Once your valuation reaches a certain point and the structure of investments is more complex (liquidity preferences, etc.), founders can easily find themselves in a no-win situation even with a moderately successful business.<p>As they say, a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. This post seems intended to get founders to forget this.",1421099739

8876632,comment,8872100,8873207,0,0,techjuice,,,"This is not a problem with the language but the one programming in the language not having a more in depth understanding of the language.  Rushing for results without working out a proper solution or really understanding how to get from point A to B to get those results may end up with a false result.  How do you prove and verify your work if you are taking short cuts to get something you hope is the correct answer.  How do you know what you just copied and pasted is the most efficient way of solving the problem.  When moving to C or C++ there are normally faster ways to accomplish tasks then what is possible with higher level languages due to the built-in limits of the higher level language.<p>It is similar to learning Calculus, Statistics, Number Theory, etc. you start at the beginning with basic math and move up the later, trying to skip these foundation and using what you find online without the capability to verify is a grave mistake.  Those that skip the base foundation will be those that make grave errors in the future that can cost lives, time and or money.<p>Once you take the required time to learn C and or C++ you will eventually understand the power you have at your fingertips and what you once thought was hard or cumbersome will no longer be that way.  A benefit of learning C and or C++ is that you will understand the languages they are built in better.  Especially if you want to optimize the higher level code for performance or if you unfortunately find a security hole you will be able to assist with submitting a more detailed security report.<p>I see you are focused on seeing results as fast as possible, if you learn C and or C++ more in depth you will get the results faster when you run your professional grade code.  On your note about having to rewrite a big chunk of the program eventually this is not true if you know what you want to do, design it properly up front and insure it is not heavily coupled with other parts of your code.  C++ is a great language to get deep into object oriented programming and C for functional programming, learning both in depth will open your mind up to more battle-tested solutions that you can apply in higher level programming languages.<p>Just give it time you will see the light and it will help you in both lower and higher level programming languages.",1421099270

I&#x27;m at an earlier stage than PG&#x27;s target audience for this -- still bootstrapping but experiencing 20-30% month/month growth and getting ready to go that next step (probably seed).<p>At this stage I&#x27;ve gotten what after reading this essay sounds like the baby brother of this: the oddly aggressive hire attempt. These companies have been not necessarily direct competitors but people in related spaces who might want to add what I&#x27;m doing to their tech portfolio or use its techniques in their products.<p>The interactions have been quite different from any other &quot;job interview&quot; I&#x27;ve ever had. I&#x27;ve said no three times so far to some version of: &quot;your project is awesome,&quot; followed by some interesting discussion, followed by a hiring offer. The hiring offers have been decent but not outstanding, and they&#x27;ve included nothing for the project -- no &quot;acquisition&quot; to go with the hire. When I bring this up, the response is that my baby isn&#x27;t &quot;worth very much on its own,&quot; etc. In one case the response was oddly condescending even in its wording, which was discouraging until I went and read all the users raving about my stuff and then looked at my rather nice looking metrics again. In another case it was explained to me that while my product was interesting, I obviously wasn&#x27;t... &quot;business&quot; enough? That&#x27;s not how they put it but that was kind of the implication. I interpreted it as &quot;you&#x27;re not coming off as alpha male enough to run a business&quot; or some version of that.<p>In retrospect I saw these as negotiating tactics to shake my confidence in moving forward myself. These folks are trying to get me plus a lot (3 years) of code, users, and momentum without actually paying anything for the latter two things. Looks a lot like the kind of hardball PG is talking about-- I assume &quot;corp dev&quot; offers come in when you&#x27;re at a bit of a later stage.<p>Now I&#x27;ve got another one in the pipeline. I&#x27;ve decided the best way to deal with them is to go ahead and chat but otherwise to change <i>nothing</i> about what I am doing, to not spend much time on them, and to constantly remind myself that I am the one interviewing <i>them</i> and deciding whether to accept their offer. At this point given the metrics I&#x27;m seeing, the offer would have to be very good.<p>I&#x27;d say that the advice in this essay is probably good advice. If you do have the internal discipline/experience to put these sorts of things in a &quot;maybe but probably not&quot; folder, it <i>might</i> not hurt to chat about it with them, but if you have any doubt or if you&#x27;re too busy just say no and move on.

It won&#x27;t help and will likely kill you.<p>For type 2s, this is somewhat sound advice. While I don&#x27;t imagine too many type 2s who have the discipline necessary to not do that which they have overdone for years for 20 to 30 days, a type 2 eating a lot less (or perhaps fasting entirely under doctor&#x27;s supervision), it will definitely help better the situation and would be a great step in getting their diabetes under control.<p>What I find frustrating is that this research is being done for the section of diabetics who actually have control over their diabetic destiny, simply stop being obese by any means necessary. As a type 1, I honestly resent Type 2s who do nothing to better their situation. This research is just another way for Type 2s to not have to deal with the consequences of their actions ahead of me and those like me being liberated from our sharps, glucose monitors and pumps.<p>Wow, I am raging, better check my levels ;]",1421096891

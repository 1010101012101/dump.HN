Such as a VC round, a real exit (acquisition), or a certain level of prominence and profitability - that which is not compatible with bootstrapping. Boostrapping is only great when you attack a small niche, that is too small for people with more resources to get into. The same smallness will inevitably make meaningful ""exits"" impossible.",1281985132

In essay writing, this usually involves multiple revisions, again and again, across the same space. In essay reading, this usually involves a closer level of engagement with a text and its progression than is otherwise normal -- somehow, via its thoroughness, it challenges us.<p>The disadvantages with this type of approach are that you can get off base. Hence, something more dynamic, with feedback (in the form of a Socratic dialogue, etc.) can be much more useful. Perhaps the Internet has the potential for being more Socratic -- was my point before. But only if we understand exactly how it fits -- how, arguably, we've been waiting for this, in our linearity, for a long time. But if we abuse its dynamic qualities, we might totally lose it. So Nick Carr by reminding us that we might think about these things -- is useful.<p>The advantages of the linear approach are that by dwelling with something in an engaged manner -- you can often extract value that otherwise superficial readings don't. At some point all ideas come into contact with each other, and are validated, etc. But arguably by giving people more space to develop their ideas -- sort of mentioned in this article:<p><a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/16/technology/16brain.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/16/technology/16brain.html</a><p>-- you extract more value.",1281985122

I'm sure PG might correct me if I'm wrong, but the philosophy of YC is that it's the founders themselves which determine a startup's chances of success. It's not saving a few thousand dollars on living expenses. You should be focused on getting your startup what it needs to be successful, and that's the right people first, money second, if at all. Of all the things YC provides the funding is probably the <i>least</i> significant thing influencing a startup's possible success.",1281985030

And that's perfectly fine. Unless it happens even when you don't do sport.<p>That's my problem, I smell and I don't need to run 30 miles for that.\nThe strange part is, it only happens when I'm not comfortable in social situations, for example at work, but I don't smell if I'm at a bar with friends or alone at my house.<p>And because of that, my social life is quite terrible. \nImagine for a moment that you smell, and you have to go to work, and all you can think during you work-time is how bad you must smell, and how eager you are that the day finally end so you won't hear your coworkers sniff all the time around you.<p>You can't concentrate, you can't study anything, the only thing in your mind is how bad you smell, and the more you think of it, the more you smell because you're more stressed.<p>How can you go to a classroom, a conference, a movie, or simply enjoy life when you are so ashamed of ruining people's comfort ?<p>Picture yourself trying to learn some maths in a maths course, and the only thing you could think of is how to hide your own odour. When the course end, you don't have learned anything.<p>Actually I can't pinpoint the source of the smell on my body, but I noticed that at the end of the day, if I press my nose or try to smell the mucus (yeah that's not very sexy), it smells bad.\nI did a sinus scan, a dentist check, went to the ENT and everything seems ok.<p>I think the problem is psychological, although the smell is real (some studies show that some people believe that they smell when they don't but that's not my case, I know that I do).<p>Do pheromones actually exist in humans ?\nIs it possible that I smell when I'm stressed because it's a kind of defense mechanics ?<p>I don't think people realize how bad it actually is.\nWhen you're ugly, or disabled, you could still have a social life (I'm not saying that I would rather be disabled, you need a lot of courage to have a ""normal"" life while disabled), but I least you could get support.\nWho support you if you smell ? Nobody. People assume you don't bath (my hygiene is probably better than most people's), and you're just ""the smelly one"". People don't have compassion for you. You don't bond with other people and everybody knows that in the end, the only thing that counts is social relationships.<p>Please HN, please, help me.<p>I couldn't find help on the internet, I wrote that thread like a message in a bottle (and I'm so ashamed that I used a throw away account and Tor, just in case), and I hope that maybe someone here could give me useful informations or advices, because I know that comments here often give new perspectives.<p>And if you don't have any advices, you could still discuss about the fact that people with a strong body odour are discriminated.<p>Dear fellow hackers, please help me.",1281984764

1608664,comment,1608053,1608053,0,0,jjcm,,,"I've been using haml and sass for a while now, and I have to say that once you start using them, it's hard to go back. Sure, the major upfront benefit is less typing involved. For sass, there's no longer the long-winded<p>#main #content .post .title h3<p>CSS associations that you have to manually type out (or copy paste) each time you want to declare a style for something. More importantly though is that it creates much more readability. I can go back to code that I wrote months ago and see exactly where a style that I need to change is located in sass, whereas in CSS I'll have to poke around a bit. The tab delimited hierarchies will be a godsend when first you use them.<p>The variable declarations can be nice as well, although I haven't used those to their fullest capacity yet. Even without them though, I'd still use sass. That's not to say it doesn't have downfalls. It is another level of abstraction that you have to deal with. If you're building a server that's hosting .sass files, you'll need a sass compiler - not something you necessarily want to think about on a deadline. Then again, you can always just compile them before you deploy your packages, but you have to remember to update the .sass files if you ever make any on-the-fly changes on the server. That can always be remedied though by having a dedicated stylesheet server, although I typically only use one of those for development. I have a blank haml/sass template that I use for styling front ends, and will direct any site I'm currently making, regardless of the language, to the stylesheets hosted by that project. Even if you don't think you'll use it, I'd still give it a shot if you haven't played with it already.",1281983047

I haven't tried modern Perl. Maybe you could lure me back to perl.<p>I programmed in perl for about 4 to 5 years on an intermittent basis. I though it was great. I then switched to python because my lab was doing a big project in python. I ultimately became more comfortable with python over perl for some very simple reasons. (1) Readability. I could understand code from others far more quickly. I could understand <i>my own code</i> better after leaving it for a while. (2) Introspection in the REPL. Things like dir and docstrings were very helpful. Initially I felt the perl debugger was superior, but I came to rely on pydb running inside ipython and got along ok. (3) CPAN. Python was way behind but got close enough for me after easy_install became common. scipy and numpy were important to me and the perl variant of these things (pdl, I recall) seemed to lag. (4) OO was always easier for me to grok in python, probably because it was originally designed with OO in mind.<p>In the end I found I really don't like OO all that much, and now I code in haskell, which is an entirely different story.<p>Looking back I would also say that Perl6 was a huge distraction without a big payoff. It should have killed off Perl 5, yet it lives. Seems like Python 3 has similar issues.

That's really just a case of if you don't practice, you don't get better -- you can work around that by combining body building with endurance exercise, but that would mean taking time away from bodybuilding, which is a question of priorities and goals.<p>As for speed and power, they definitely decrease with bodybuilding workouts. Bodybuilding workouts DO build strength, but they also lead to higher muscle tension.<p>In martial arts, the LAST thing you want is a lot of muscle tension -- the big, strong guys that train with me tend to get very frustrated by how effortless my blocks are when they attack me, and how painful my short strikes are -- again with an apparent lack of effort. In fact, more effort almost invariably leads to LESS power, as well as less speed  -- because of a few factors:\n1) You tend to use fewer muscles, and smaller ones \n2) You tend to fight yourself a lot more, which holds you back\n3) You tend to unbalance yourself, which compromises your ability to move and therefore your efficiency.<p>Having said all that, you CAN build muscle without taking on those disadvantages, but the trade off is that you will end up spending a significant portion of your training time on something other than body building in order to do it.",1281982209

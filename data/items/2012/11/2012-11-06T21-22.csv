4751047,comment,4749362,4749362,1,0,apawloski,,,"This is attack was the natural extension of Ristenpart et al's ""prime, trigger and probe"" attack [1], which looks like this:<p>(1) Prime: Read B at s-byte offsets in order to ensure it is
cached.<p>(2) Trigger: Busy-loop until the CPUs cycle counter jumps
by a large value. (This means our VM was preempted by
the Xen scheduler, hopefully in favor of the sender VM.)<p>(3) Probe: Measure the time it takes to again read B at
s-byte offsets.<p>The idea is that if the co-resident VM's level of activity will increase the time it takes to read B (because the other VM cleared the CPU cache).<p>When they first published this, they noted that stealing cryptographic keys in a context like EC2 seemed impractical, saying ""In practice, cryptographic cross-VM attacks turn out to be somewhat more difficult to realize due to factors such as core migration, coarser scheduling algorithms, double indirection of memory addresses, and
(in the case of EC2) unknown load from other instances and a fortuitous choice of CPU configuration (e.g. no hyperthreading).""<p>It's really cool to see that they finally successfully implemented it.<p>[1]<a href=""http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~hovav/dist/cloudsec.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~hovav/dist/cloudsec.pdf</a> (PDF)",1352239180

I work for an agency, not a start-up, but it's the same process: convince someone within an organization to pay you large sums of cash for services.<p>In both cases, we were providing services to a single product group within a company large enough that those product groups can act nearly autonomously. And in both cases, the corporate office came to the (quite rational) decision that having ten product groups using ten different agencies was inefficient. In one case, corp's pet agency became the agency of record; in the other case, they actually built an in-house department from scratch and stopped using agencies altogether.<p>If there's a moral to this story, it's to scale that ladder. If your product/service/whatever only has one customer within a large organization, your use is vulnerable to consolidation moves. But, if your one user is happy and satisfied, you can often use that to gain wider traction within a company. In addition to more customers, it's a much safer position to be in when someone from on high wants to start standardizing across the organization.",1352239042

Same idiotic mania to make products thinner at the expense of battery life (especially stupid from the company that swears you never need to change a battery).  Same keyboards with no real Delete keys.<p>Now glued-in batteries.  Soldered-in RAM.<p>This entire decline of Apple's product line reflects massive failure to recognize what Apple has helped prove: a lot of people don't need a computer.  Computer users and tablet users are DIVERGING, so the last thing the devices should do is CONVERGE.  If someone fires up a computer now, he needs a COMPUTER and not a crippled gimmick.  Why would I buy a computer if it's just a tablet with a keyboard?  I can buy... A TABLET WITH A KEYBOARD.<p>People are finally realizing that Apple is sadly detached from real-world usage, but they've been getting a free pass on it for decades.  Literally decades.  They capitalized when the competition simply showed greater stupidity than they did:<p>1. Creative Labs utterly blew the design and marketing of MP3 players.<p>2. Everyone blew the UI and functionality of cell phones, which pretty much fell off a cliff after the StarTAC.<p>3. Microsoft became moribund, lost, and increasingly irrelevant as the only things a lot of people needed to do were surf the Web and play media.<p>The sheen is off.  It may be fiascoes like Maps that started some critical thinking, but there are many more fundamental problems that reveal Apple's dire need for a common-sense overhaul of its product line.

You are welcome to demonstrate that there is.<p>Sounds to me like you are doing low frequency strategies; it's a completely different ballgame than HFT. He's done 400,000 trades, half of them long, half of them short.

(Nanex publishes analysis on these events, which are not occuring several times a month and keep accelerating).<p>In Europe, HFT is mostly what OP describes, because they have reasonable control (e.g., you have to have one execution per 10 orders or pay a fine; in US exchanges, you can sometime finds 10,000 orders submitted in 3 seconds, hundreds of thousands per hour, with 10-20 executions).<p>> Also limiting trades isn't really adequate risk management. The tech exists to very accurately model your exposures.<p>That's basically what AIG did with copulas. Unfortunately, the assumptions in these models tend to break during crisis, when correlations go to one. And AIG went bankrupt.<p>Limiting trades, done correctly (mathematically AND legally) is the ONLY way to do risk management properly. With more assumptions, you can have ""more efficient"" risk management in terms of leverage (e.g., you can net S&P and RUSSELL exposure by assuming their correlation structure) - but as AIG has shown, that does not mean you are doing a better job of managing your risk.",1352238867

And ""no service produced"" is certainly wrong by accepted economic theory - arbitrageurs provide a price discovery service for everyone; they get rewarded for exposing the inefficient prices, even though it is done through market mechanics rather than a specific customer.<p>OP appears to be a statistical arbitrageur - which is the same concept, except that it includes a shift in time or space (and incurs risk). You might not be interested in this price discovery service, but other people are paying for it with their wallet. (And it's mostly the market makers who pay for this with reduced profits)<p>> one trader's gain being another trader's loss (relative to market returns).<p>That's not true in investing in general - when shares have time to appreciate or depreciate, it is definitely not a zero sum game. Everyone can win, or everyone can lose, or anything in between (it all depends on your time range, and your measure of loss or profit. The ""non-zero-sum"" element arrives partly from companies using operating profit to buy back their own shares).<p>> Because there's a commission on trades, and because you pay taxes on net gains but your minimum tax is zero, high frequency trading by its very nature must a loss for most players.<p>That's only true if all players are hf players. If there is sufficient non-HF activity, then the zero-sum argument does not hold.<p>(I'm not saying that it's not a good approximation - in most time scales, in most scenarios, it is - but it is not the mathematical truth you imply it is)",1352238406

The new rules spell out what a Web site operator must include in a privacy policy, when and how to seek verifiable consent from a parent and what responsibilities an operator has to protect children's privacy and safety online.""<p>One of the reasons I didn't become a web developer in grade school is that when this bill was first written, Geocities decided to comply by modifying their TOS, and then unilaterally terminating edit access to a 12-year-old's account.  After turning 13, they refused to reinstate or accept another signup from the same email due to TOS violations.  The site remained up, though thankfully without any personal info on it.  You can imagine the countermeasures I took after that against a similar attack.  Teaching the children that they have to lie and ignore contractual/legal restrictions to do anything useful becomes a standard very early that continues through their contact with music, games, movies, pornography, filesharing, alcohol, drugs, and hookups.  ""Protect the Children"" is an easy, cowardly rallying cry for a Joe Lieberman or a Tipper Gore, but teaching them that all the good stuff happens behind an adult's/corporation's back robs them of their free will within the bounds of the law, and of their respect for anything the powers that be are trying to do.<p>It is my contention that internet pseudonymity / anonymity is a treasured part of our culture, and part of the way we route around damage.  It is essentially required of our minors due to the way we disenfranchise them while simultaneously requiring an online presence for a lot of personally & socially beneficial activities.  The hideous notion recently brought up of criminalizing a TOS violation and tying it to jail-time would largely shut minors out of the Internet altogether, by any reasonable cautionary standard.  A constellation of laws which requires broad criminality, and is completely selectively enforceable, brings the status of rule of law itself into question.<p>On this November 6, let's say this: I don't think minors would be in quite so dire of a position if we could all (read: All American Citizens) vote.",1352238398

Reject ones that do not process properly (i.e. the one you described above would be rejected if there were conflicting indicators). I thought I remembered MN doing that (I lived/voted there ~a decade ago), for example, and I'm pretty sure my poling place here in Illinois did that last time as well (haven't been there yet today). It's not an impossible task to enforce the same constraints on a paper ballot, doing so with the voter present and able to clarify/fix their ballot.<p>3)You try really, really hard to design easy to understand and use paper ballots (for all the reasons I said above, you need paper for an audit trail). Good communication design (i.e.: how you design/layout the ballot forms) matters <i>a lot</i> and most of them are terrible.<p>That, however, is no excuse for accepting an electronic system which gives up any ability to audit the count in a reliable way (and, unless the voter verifies a physical printout, no electronic system can be reliable, as discussed above).",1352237702

This is key. It's important to benchmark your strategy against other stupid ones that you know don't have edge. When someone shows me strategies that worked in 2009 and 2010, I immediately make them prove their strategy was not the equivalent of being long equities.<p>Doing this will truly help isolate whether or not luck is involved. When you say that the number and size of your trades justifies the strategy's validity, that's just wrong. You could do 1000 trades in a day: buy 10 RUT futures at the beginning of the day, sell 10 at the end, and just scratch 1 lots for the other 998 trades. In a bull market like 09-10, that would have made 400k, and would have nothing to do with Machine Learning or its applications to HFT.<p>I make all traders benchmark their work against a series of other strategies that I know have no edge, even though they, at times, can appear to have edge.<p>Now, I'm not saying you didn't have legitimate edge, but you do your readers a disservice by omitting relevant stats and discussions like that.",1352235820

In the end, you need to essentially produce a paper ballot but you burden the voter with having to check it after already having voted in a different medium.

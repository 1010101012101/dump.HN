422760,story,,,4,0,mjnaus,"Ask HN: Any successful entrepreneurs out there with a business degree?",,"I had a long discussion with a friend of mine who teaches business at a local university. I argued that it really makes no sense to me to have teachers - without real life business experience - educate students about running a successful business. The discussion heated up and at one point I said I thought people with a business degree were actually at a disadvantage compared to people without a business education when it comes to creating a new business. My argument was that those without a conventional business education were less likely to hold on to taught conventions, will get all the knowledge they use to make decisions from real life experience and will spend less time trying to apply conventional business principles to their business and more time working on stuff that simply needs to be done (who the hell needs a business plan to get started, seriously).<p>He challenged me to come up with some examples to back up my argument; so are there successful entrepreneurs here on HN who have a business degree? And what about the other side, have you been successful without business education? By successful I simply mean being able to achieve the goals you set for yourself.<p>Thanks much!",1231289788
422759,comment,422575,422575,0,0,s_tec,,,"Since HTML will be around for a long time, the author says, we need a mechanism for adding new semantics to the language over time. Well, the W3C already has a nice mechanism for doing that called ""adding new elements"". This system works just fine, and there is no reason to define a monstrosity like <div structure=""header""> when defining a new <header> element would accomplish the same goal. The only valid complaint against adding new elements is that IE doesn't apply CSS to elements it doesn't recognize. Fortunately, a simple workaround exists: <a href=""http://xopus.com/devblog/2008/style-unknown-elements.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://xopus.com/devblog/2008/style-unknown-elements.html</a>",1231289710

422721,comment,421542,422507,0,0,barbie17,,,"You should check out Macroeconomics by Mankiw. It's very short and sweet. You really shouldn't judge economics by a few articles aimed at lay audiences just as you wouldn't try to learn about quantum mechanics from the NYTimes. Economics is filled with clever little insights that makes you go ""Ahh!"".<p>I'll take the time to explain some of your complaints:<p>""spending causes prosperity"": well, obviously if you don't spend any of your money obviously you don't have prosperity. If you borrow money to spend economics assume that you are rational and that it is because you prefer having a good time now to later. This seems more like a value judgment though, which most economics tend to avoid.<p>""conflation of trade deficits with indebtedness"": well, if country A wants to consume something produced by country B, it can only do so in three ways: 1) give B something A produced, 2) give B a chunk of A (e.g., real estate) or 3) borrow from B. Since most countries don't like 2), trade deficits are settled using 3)<p>Most economics will say that a higher savings rate will be beneficial in the long run but if people suddenly saved more because of government policy there will a aggregate demand shock and the economy will go into a recession since the price level cannot easily adjust in the short run. (When people save more they have less money to spend and thus all prices become ""too high"" for them.)<p>Check out the book for more information. You will find that while economics may have flaws, it is internally self-consistent. It just doesn't take into account that most people are not rational :(.",1231286931

So you found the twitteresque transcript pounded out by some guy desperately trying to keep up with live events from his seat on his laptop little dry, and you blame Phil Schiller? I thought Phil was positively engaging. The audience was on the edge of their seats for almost the entire keynote, and the ""Ooos"", ""Aaas"", and gasps were abundant. The products Phil highlighted all showed how Apple, once again, is innovating where everyone else is still working on getting a usable v.1. There's no one in iPhoto or iMovie's class, Keynote's iPhone integration just put another nail in RIM's coffin, and every laptop designer in the world just slapped themselves on the forehead, realizing that if they had only put some investment into stores and service, they too could have an 8-hour(!) laptop with no increase in size or weight.<p>It was a great keynote.

If they are not what the community currently uses, they are not idiomatic.&quot;&quot;&quot;<p>I&#x27;m not annoyed by idioms because they don&#x27;t ever change -- but because while they exist in a certain form, they inhibit experimenting with different approaches.<p>Or to be more presize, I&#x27;m not annoyed by idioms themselves (as I also wrote above), as individual practices. I&#x27;m annoyed by people insisting on them, and criticizing everything diverting (unidiomatic) as something that&#x27;s bad.<p>Nothing is static, except change. But for a specific period of time  (which can be like aeons in the software industry) idioms are for all intends and purposes static.<p>E.g Java EE land, from say, 2000-ish to 2007. The idioms were fixed and agreed upon, and most people and groups, from Apache Struts to Java engineers and IBM played by them, but they neither helped the community &quot;communicate via code&quot; nor helped &quot;make programs understandable&quot;.<p>Instead, they hindered both communication and understanding. Almost everybody agrees now that the adopted idioms at the time were bad, and inhibited progress and even slowed down projects.<p>It&#x27;s not even like &quot;it was good for it&#x27;s time, but we eventually came up with something better&quot;. We always had the option to do the better thing (it doesn&#x27;t take unique new research to not use a 20-levels deep hierarchy or to not think GoF patterns should be applied everywhere).

9110571,comment,9109406,9109406,0,0,205guy,,,"Great, just what Mexico needs is a zero-down solar clone as a carpetbagger. The issue with zero down solar is this: solar panels (and equipment and installation) now cost about 5-10 years worth of electricity (it all depends on electric rates and any state subsidies, which are obviously different in Mexico), but they last 20 years or more. The zero-down subscription models capture that 10-15 years of revenue instead of passing it on to the electric user.<p>Much more advantageous to the homeowner would be to offer solar micro loans for the express purpose of buying and installing the panels. Structure the loan so it&#x27;s a bit less than he electric bill (and more predictable) and it should be paid off in 5-10 years, and then the owner gets he free electricity. Or the SunRun power purchase model where the company sells all solar output to the homeowner for the cost of the system (either upfront or on a monthly payment plan), but the company still owns the panels (and could conceivably recover them in case of non-payment).<p>As far as I can tell, the zero-down model only works because of slick marketing and the general public being unfamiliar with the true low cost and possible financing of a PV system.<p>And I&#x27;m sure the Mexican population is thrilled about having a foreign-backed company data mining their financial info and creating an unregulated credit agency.",1424908301

The claims are about the prices of assets and their relation to information.

Random movements or other non-knowable events are not part of the EMH.<p>2 - all EMH versions talk about <i>risk adjusted</i> returns.

The Dennis system was particularly risky, especially in comparison to other market participants like him.<p>3 - Dennis&#x27; <i>system</i> did not perform well over a long period.  The <i>system</i> does not perform well past 1986 and was only first codified in either 1983 or 84.  Dennis performed better over that time, but his system did not.

As a non-Googler, Mountain View resident who owns a home, I can say that the vast majority of the commenters mischaracterize problem, Lenny Siegel and the MV City Council, Google and everything.<p>I should also add that I regularly attend CC meetings,etc.<p>Basic background:<p>1) Google until recently basically ignored Mountain View south of 101. Until recently Google didn&#x27;t own anything south of 101.<p>2) Google is not going anywhere. Mountain View is right next to Moffett Air field. This is where Larry and Sergey park their 767 ( <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2011/12/11/googles-3-top-executives-have-8-private-jets/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techcrunch.com/2011/12/11/googles-3-top-executives-ha...</a> ) - Maybe Sunnyvale would be an alternative but I really doubt there are too many spots where L and S can be in walking distance of their 767. Furthermore Google is leasing a shit ass land from NASA to expand on.<p>3) Its not just Google: Google, LinkedIn, Intuit, Symantec, all have HQs here. Microsoft/Nokia also have their research centers here.<p>4) Google, et.al. subsides all services at their HQ as a result outside retail/restaurants have pretty much died north of 101. This results in local business owners/voters complaining to city council.<p>5) Google woke up to the political problem when MV CC told Google that they were not going to be allowed build a connection bridge across Stevens Creek Trail for buses. ( a trail that MV residents worked 25 years to create )<p>6) Google land purchases have resulted in increases in real-estate taxes, however Google generates NO sales tax revenue for the city. (same problem with the other companies)<p>7) Land in North Bayshore has gotten so expensive that there is serious talk about putting a building on top of the VTA North County Maintenance Yard.<p>8) Mountain View renters have seen Y/Y increases of about 20-25%. A 2 bedroom/2 bath apartment goes for $3300.<p>9) The city planners have gotten so many building requests that the city has no staff to deal with the requests.<p>10) The school districts have real problems keeping teachers - turnover for some schools runs 6-10%.<p>11) Non-tech workers are being forced out - you know people like teachers, waiters, security guards. The MV Building inspectors have found entire families living in a single room ( <a href=""http://mv-voice.com/news/2013/07/26/high-cost-housing-creates-desperate-living-conditions"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mv-voice.com/news/2013/07/26/high-cost-housing-create...</a> )<p>12) The 3 new city council members are all pro-housing. The anti-housing candidates were rejected. Therefore comments along the lines of : stop whining and do something - well the new city council is doing something. Specifically, demanding that more housing gets built and less office space. We are trying to make room for the new people. In many cases these are our children.<p>13) Google to its credit is starting to throw some money at Mountain View Capital Improvement Project list to help out.<p>14) Google, Mountain View are working out a traffic management plan to reduce solo drivers - the whole of north bayshore is only accessible by 3 roads. Residents who live in north bayshore right now cannot get to/from their house between 8:30 and 10 and 4:30 and 6.<p>I might add more to this list but I think this is a good start.",1424906517

In other words, the post-ejaculatory horniness level was not always equal to zero, as the naive theory propounded above assumes, but to some other quantity dependent upon whether the ejaculation was induced by Self or Other: [sigma] =[sigma sub self] after masturbation but [sigma]=[sigma sub other] upon leaving a whorehouse, where [sigma sub self] > [sigma sub other] an inequality to which Waterhouse’s notable successes in breaking certain Nip naval codes at Station Hypo were directly attributable, in that the many convenient whorehouses nearby made it possible for him to go somewhat longer between ejaculations.",1424906296

As I said, it&#x27;s that funded research should benefit the funders.<p>It does benefit the funders in the case of government grants. The NSF gives a researcher a grant to scientifically study some specific thing. The researcher makes scientific discoveries about the thing.<p>The researcher publishes the research, and also (possibly in collaboration with people who were not involved in the research) thinks about how the new science can be applied to produce real world products. The research gets patents on some of those real world applications of the research results.<p>Note that the public that contributed to funding the research did benefit. The research was released, and they can use it as the basis of further research, or think up useful applications for it (and patent those if someone hasn&#x27;t already).<p>I think people tend to confuse the research (which is often paid for by government grants, at least in part), and development of practical commercial applications for the results of the research, which is generally not paid for by government grants.<p>Note that if the researcher had not worked on coming up with practical applications and patented them, but instead just published the research and moved on to the next project, that doesn&#x27;t mean there would not be patents. Anyone would be free to take the published research, figure out how to apply it to practical problems, and likely get a patent on that use of the research results. Their patents would not cover the underlying research--just the use of it as described in their patent.",1424905664

The development cycles are longer, the costs are higher, each prototype is precious. Once you have succeeded, the VC needs to know that a large company cannot swoop in and make the exact same product as you.<p>Let&#x27;s say I&#x27;m working at a university and come up with a new type of GPU, it&#x27;s 10x faster than NVIDIA&#x27;s & AMD&#x27;s. If I have a patent, I can raise VC funding and take on NVIDIA/AMD because NVIDIA/AMD cannot make the same thing and sell it in the USA (a large market). Now there is NVIDIA, AMD, and QUANTICLES selling in the market. The products are improved because QUANTICLES is 10x faster, and NVIDIA and AMD have their own selling points. EDIT: The public benefits here because improved products are on the market and jobs are created in the USA.<p>Let&#x27;s say I&#x27;m working at a university and come up with a new GPU but cannot patent it because University Patents Are Evil. Now NVIDIA/AMD are free to pursue it, or not, if they chose. Likely they wont because there is a significant ground to cover between university project and actual product. Usually there are many issues and tradeoffs to solve, solving these issues/tradeoffs is risky, and NVIDIA/AMD cannot take on the risk or are not aware they should.<p>Main point: startups are a proving ground for new ideas that big companies can&#x27;t afford to take on, or choose not to. The university comes up with the idea and then the startup tries to prove that it works in a commercial environment. If there is no protection for that company after it&#x27;s proven then investment is a losing bet.<p>Software/Web companies have a different sort of protection than hardware companies: users. A user is a customer that gets entrenched in a product. For example, how often do you change email services? How often do you change online photo catalogs? Each year I do my taxes on the same site since I can import my settings from the previous year and I know how to use it.<p>Hardware companies do not get entrenched as easily. Many times hardware can be switched in and out with other hardware (for example, GPUs). This also creates a feast or famine environment - you either have big sales because you&#x27;re best product on the market, or you have none because you don&#x27;t. If a startup cannot protect itself then it may not be worth investing in.",1424905492

Curation of package sources.\n2. People installing packages they shouldn&#x27;t have.<p>Curation of package sources: notice that people don&#x27;t complain nearly as much about dpkg/apt packages: they&#x27;re curated much more carefully than npm/RubyGems packages (which is to say, they are curated).<p>People installing packages they shouldn&#x27;t have: often the problems people run into with package management are self-inflicted. The adage is old: &quot;Libraries from CPAN should not be treated as if they were part of the core.&quot; &quot;Everyone else&quot;, as you say, is not experiencing DLL hell. I have zero difficulty with package management, because I use mature libraries and specify versions in my package configurations. There&#x27;s no excuse to be experiencing DLL hell these days. The people who experience DLL hell are the ones who don&#x27;t check in package configurations and then are surprised when the 0.1 alpha package they installed makes a breaking change and they don&#x27;t know which version their code works with.<p>This is a problem in the Ruby community in particular because part of the draw of Ruby is &quot;there&#x27;s a package for everything&quot;. Newbie devs get caught up in the ecstatic frenzy of solving all their problems with gems without researching or testing those gems at all. But that&#x27;s not a problem solved by Go&#x27;s lack of a package manager, it&#x27;s a problem solved by looking more carefully at what dependencies you introduce before introducing them.",1424905391

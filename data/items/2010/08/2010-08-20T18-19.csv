I buy veggies from the market here in Chicago because I can go to the farms and see how they're growing the produce.  While lowering the energy factor is a bonus, it certainly isn't the reason I eat mostly local food.  I eat local because I want to know how animals are treated, ensure that animals aren't bloated with corn feed, and to ensure that I'm not eating chemically (ammonia) laced meat.<p>It's also important to put money back into your local community.  If I spend $50 at a chain grocery store, very, very little of that is going into the local economy.  If I spend $50 on meat from a local farm, all $50 is going to the local economy.<p>PS How's the 1/2 pig?",1282330765

The interesting thing is how nowadays we model buildings and statues after our notion of what classical art looked like, but the models were never intended to look like that. It's almost cargo-cultish, in its own way. Of course, the non-color elements like the shapes and the proportions still stand through, and those are definitely worthy of study. But painting such a sculpture or building like this would probably be outright offensive to some people.<p>The color-restored versions somehow look less... impressive with the colors on, but that could be just because I'm used to thinking of the colorless versions as more regal. On the other hand, black-and-white photographs look more artistic as well, so it could be something about the lack of color itself.<p>If you want to see how ancient classical buildings looked when they were in use, check out the old British TV series ""I, Claudius.""

During the same period, JPM, C, and BAC also had a perfect quarter (1).<p>While its true that HFT groups tend to have great win/loss records (2), those ""trading profits"" basically have nothing to do with the banks' HFT groups.  The banks basically all had very big carry trades on -- they were borrowing at short term rates from the fed and lending at higher rates to others and collecting the spread.  Since the Fed was desperate to pump money into the system, they allow banks to borrow cheaply and essentially guaranteed the carry trade for the short term.<p>That sort of trade tends to be highly stable in static rate environments and you get very smooth return profiles.  Since they knew the Fed was essentially backing the trade, they piled onto the trade and that particular component of the firms' total daily P&L just dwarfs the rest of their ""real"" prop trading operation P&L.<p>Of course, it won't last forever.

Can my fellow Hacker News readers help with an ideal Babson MBA Capstone Project? An ideal project has five attributes:<p>1. Involves a product, a process, a service and/or a business model (not simply technology licensing, geographical market expansion, etc.)<p>2. Requires more than incremental innovation (technology, market, and business model risk cannot all be ""low"")<p>3. Requires a new organization approach that is entrepreneurial rather than efficiency-oriented.<p>4. Significant progress and learning is feasible within the course timeframe and resources. (persuasive evidence of customer need exists, ""technology lift"" is not too heavy, intellectual property entanglements are not too daunting)<p>5. Ignites the passion of a 4-6 person project team (more than just an ""academic exercise"", a commercially-viable opportunity - much more than simply an idea, raison d'etre mertis serious effort, offers a powerful learning opportunity.)<p>Are you ready to help in our opportunity search?

Almost every single long web form I've seen or filled out goes down where there is a clear sequential order. Think about long forms on SurveyMonkey or the product selection form on any computer manufacturing website. The main exceptions seem to be for very short forms (~4 fields).<p><i>They provide a phone number, office hours, and a satisfaction assurance.</i><p>None of that is different from the competition.<p><i>About whether manually quoting prices is a good idea or not... I think overall it facilitates the sales process, not harms it.

From a buyer/consumer perspective, this pricing uncertainty and lack of information can be confusing and even bad. Imagine having to do this for airline prices, etc. Even FedEx will quote you a price for a similar service (and they use vertical forms: <a href=""http://at.fedex.com/QX58q"" rel=""nofollow"">http://at.fedex.com/QX58q</a>).<p>An aside: whenever I hear something along the lines of ""a fact of the industry"" I usually smell money. That doesn't mean I know how to get it, but it's somewhere out there.<p><i>But does that really matter?</i><p>Absolutely. This is not an industry where there are one or two or three players. There are dozens of competitors and if I'm entrusting my business -- and goods worth thousands and thousands of dollars -- I'm going with the ""most professional"" people. I may pay more for it, though I don't want to. I'm not going to go with the firm that has so little attention to detail that they can't correct typos on a website that has likely been around for years.

They can't simply advertise the bandwidth, because you actually need to have the right piece of hardware. Imagine if they sold you a ""1MB/sec"" connection but it didn't work: ""Oh, I am sorry dear customer, but you need to have a UMTS phone for that"". I'd be really pissed at that point. :)<p>Edit: actually another such case is Flash format. You get SD, SDHC, SDXC, for example.

There may not be much variation within a particular customer's preferences, but there is a great deal of variation between the preferences of different customers.<p>Eliminating choices might make things simpler for some customers, but it will also shrink your market by alienating those customers whose preferences differ from your new standard offering.

Most of the action there, as in AI and ML at large these days---eg, the focus also at ICML and at other venues---is in statistical methods.<p>(On the other hand, neuroscience and explicitly biological neural modeling are exciting areas, reasonably well-represented at NIPS. Those topics, however, are almost entirely different from neural networks of the multilayer perceptron / [Hyper]NEAT varieties.)<p>But your criticism of the article seems accurate. ACO isn't new, and there's little evidence that it will solve any of the major outstanding problems in AI.<p>Less generously, however, I'd suggest that much of the research related to the family of population-based stochastic search methods, ACO, PSO, and HyperNEAT included, is prone to the same risk: the lack of a field-wide theoretical foundation, coupled with the absence of a field-wide standard methodology and benchmark set for empirical comparison (as opposed to, say, the situation in supervised learning), makes it temptingly easy for a particular researcher to believe too strongly in the capabilities of that researcher's pet algorithm. This situation seems to have balkanized the field (page through a recent GECCO proceedings, for example), and holds back wider progress.<p>That's not to say that HyperNEAT can't do great things. It's a fun approach, and Stanley et al are running far with it. But your boosterism of it, and the boosterism of ACO that you're objecting to, seem closely related.<p>(For contrast, I'd suggest, eg, the natural gradient work at IDSIA.

There clearly is a benefit:<p>* Out-of-season vegetables are very often of lower quality than canned; the obvious example is tomatoes, but you're also not going to eat a ramp in December, or a high-quality parsnip in May, or a Vidalia in the fall.<p>* The consumer embrace of faux-fresh off-season veg actually is a bad thing; it pushes out producers who make real veg in favor of people who are selling wax veg year-round; people are still buying wax tomatoes in July.<p>* Alienation from seasonal cooking results in home cooks who, like me, had never tasted a ramp or a morel or a vidalia or even a real tomato; seasonal cooking is vector towards <i>good</i> cooking, and one thing that I think is hard to argue is that America needs more and better home cooks.<p>* Supermarket meat is a bona fide debacle. There's universal agreement that we've managed to breed flavor and health out of pigs almost entirely. Industrial chicken is epsilon away from being grown in vats instead of farms. Beef is being treated with ammonia before grinding (the trend towards buying meat not only pre-ground but pre-<i>shaped</i> is another pathology).<p>* ""Local meat"" is in some cases actually <i>cheaper</i> than the supermarket crap; you have to make a lifestyle concession to get access to those prices (ie, you have to have a $150 chest freezer, and you have to be willing to actually cook), but high-quality pig and beef is <i>not</i> out of the reach of a lower-middle-class homeowner.<p>* I live in the midwest. I'm not a fan of St. Pollan[1], but there are some restaurant owners here that I do admire and who make a point of sticking to midwest-seasonal. I take exception to the idea that it ""really sucks"". We should meet in the middle. In the colder climes, we should be shipping in ""accent"" products from the west coast to liven things up, but there's plenty of regional produce that can and should form the staple. Right now, we're at the other extreme: most people in Chicago are happy to eat a caprese with gassed-red wax tomatoes and mutant basil and kraft mozzeralla in the middle of January.<p>* And don't get me started on our access to cheese here.<p>[1] <i>Although I like his writing about plants.

We're talking about machines powerful enough to compute anything that any Turing machine can compute.   You are correct that any one of these machines can emulate any of the others.<p>What's relevant to Kurzweil's argument is two-fold:<p>If I tell you about Turing-class machine A and give you Turing-class machine B, we know right away that you can write an A emulator that runs on B.   We know that because they are both Turing class.  What we don't know is how big that emulator program is.   It might take a trillion lines of code just to write the emulator.<p>Next, I have told you about machine A but now I also give you a 50 Megabyte program (called ""GENOME"") that runs on machine A.   Now you must write your emulator, encode GENOME for your emulator, and run it on B.   We know you can do that since these are both Turing class machines.  What we do not know is how many bits it will take to encode GENOME.   It could be 50 Megabytes.  Or it could be 50 Terabytes.   You just can't tell without proving things about the specific details of machines A and B and your emulator.<p>Kurzweil makes an argument analogous to ""Hey, GENOME only takes 50MB on machine A.  There's no way it takes 50TB on machine B.  Information theory at work, man!  Use your head!""   Problem is, ""information theory"" says no such thing.  Actually, it says ""If that's all we've been told, hell it could easily take 50TB on machine B.  It could take 5 bytes.  Who knows?  There's not enough said about machines A and B or the program GENOME to tell!""<p><i>Basically I was saying that if you offer some facility to translate programs from machine A to machine B, only a very small portion of the programs on machine B will turn out to be programs that were translated from machine A. Therefore the probability of programs halting on machine A tells us nothing about what the majority of programs on machine B are likely to do, and therefore tells us very little about the probability of a random program on machine B halting.</i><p>Yes.  You are correctly observing that Omega is not really a constant - it is a class of constants.  For machine A there is Omega_A.  For machine B, Omega_B.  That is why Chaitin lectures about Omega but only after several reminders that it's really ""Omega_X for some specific machine X -- but I'm mostly just going to say Omega and let X be understood.""<p>So, now, think that through with Kurzweil goggles on.  In Kurzweil's world, a program of 50MB on one machine can't be 50TB on the next machine -- that's just silly, right?  Well, <i>if</i> he were correct then, in general, Omega_A and Omega_B, for any machines A and B, would have to be somewhat close in value.   We know that Omega_A and Omega_B don't have to be close (other than that they both come from the same (0,1) interval).

In general, if you have two different kinds of machines, and you want to program each to compute the same result -- upper bounds on the program size on machine tell you nothing about the the upper bounds on the other machine.</i><p>Right on, upper bounds on program size do not directly translate from one machine to another.  So we can't set a hard bound, and we always need to speak about information content relative to a given machine - too few people have noticed this.<p>However, science doesn't give up when hard bounds prove impossible.  There's always statistics to fall back on.<p>And statistically speaking, we can <i>absolutely</i> translate information content claims across machine boundaries if we're careful, as long as we have no reason to believe that the machine in question is somehow ""special"".<p>A priori, knowing nothing else about machines A or B, we would expect that if we observe an upper complexity bound on an algorithm relative to machine A, there's better than a 50/50 shot that the same upper complexity bound will also hold relative to machine B (it's greater than 50% because it's almost certain that our observation did not pick out the best theoretical upper complexity bound).<p>As good Bayesians, exactly how this all translates into a best estimate for the bound relative to machine B depends on a lot of stuff (all our prior distributions - in fact, in cases like this talking about upper bounds is silly, it's far better to talk about the distribution of upper bounds, but I digress).<p>But it's <i>simply wrong</i> not to adjust your complexity estimates relative to machine B in some manner based on an observation of machine A, unless you know something special about machine A that differentiates it from all machines in such a way that it's well-suited to express the algorithm under consideration.<p>So I ask you this: do you know a fact about ""zygote machines"" that makes them much better suited to constructing intelligence algorithms than most other machines?  Do you have some reason to suspect that their dynamics are more likely to lead to intelligent computations than, for instance, normal computers?<p>Because otherwise, Kurzweil is a <i>hell</i> of a lot closer to the ""right"" estimate than you are.<p>(Edit) FWIW, I posted a more detailed argument elsewhere in this thread (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1621053"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1621053</a>) that more carefully boils Myers' claim down to just about the same question I asked you.",1282328393

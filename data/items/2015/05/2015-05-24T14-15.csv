They have prioritized self-improvement and careers over relationships.&quot;<p>I&#x27;m particularly curious about what she believes the alternative option is here. Are we supposed to waste our time and self-esteem with uncertainty and self doubt in the pursuit of a relationship, or focus on something that brings immediate and tangible results, and keep building up our confidence through building and administrating tech like coding through Python and working with Linux? Personally I&#x27;ll always take the the one that brings tangible results and confidence before the one that brings depression and uncertainty.",1432479596

On the bus I rode regularly, the back of the seat in front did not have exposed metal, but many in my town did. Frankly, the fabric covered ones were not much better as you could feel the metal bar beneath the fabric. Even as a kid, I knew I was likely to get seriously injured in the event of an accident. Thankfully, accidents are rare. Perhaps, newer buses are somewhat better, but I imagine most of the old ones are still in service.",1432479398

Sorting by usage in the Wikipedia table, I don&#x27;t see much of a correlation between policy and the actual use except with primary vs. secondary enforcement, which would imply it&#x27;s more cultural than not. That said, I agree that it&#x27;s very disappointing that people don&#x27;t understand the importance of wearing a seat belt when the cases are all around us showing that in almost every situation they are beneficial.<p>&quot;Self-reported seatbelt use among adults in the United States increased steadily between 2002 and 2010, with the national prevalence reaching 87% in 2010. However, seatbelt use in states with secondary laws continues to lag behind that of states with primary laws. This lost opportunity has tremendous costs. NHTSA estimated that nearly 450 additional lives would have been saved, 12,000 nonfatal injuries prevented, and $1.6 billion in societal costs saved in 2009 alone if all states had primary laws.&quot;

Then they cancelled it after witnessing the devastation to their economic sector.<p>&quot;During the first week of the tax, the volume of bond trading fell by 85%, even though the tax rate on five-year bonds was only 0.003%. The volume of futures trading fell by 98% and the options trading market disappeared. 60% of the trading volume of the eleven most actively traded Swedish share classes moved to the UK after the announcement in 1986 that the tax rate would double. 30% of all Swedish equity trading moved offshore. By 1990, more than 50% of all Swedish trading had moved to London. Foreign investors reacted to the tax by moving their trading offshore while domestic investors reacted by reducing the number of their equity trades.<p>As a result, revenues from these taxes were disappointing. For example, revenues from the tax on fixed-income securities were initially expected to amount to 1,500 million Swedish kronor per year. They did not amount to more than 80 million Swedish kronor in any year and the average was closer to 50 million. In addition, as taxable trading volumes fell, so did revenues from capital gains taxes, entirely offsetting revenues from the equity transactions tax that had grown to 4,000 million Swedish kronor by 1988.&quot;<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish_financial_transaction_tax"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish_financial_transaction_t...</a>",1432477299
9596328,comment,9595434,9595434,0,0,IkmoIkmo,,,"So far it&#x27;s always been a great idea, just not very sustainable.<p>I mean imagine building a home for every plant you eat. It&#x27;d be kind of crazy right? You&#x27;d need to provide many of the things a typical home has: shelter, electricity, plumbing, food supply, structures etc.<p>But this is really what is proposed in these types of farms. Instead of available soil, you build a large structure, pots, racks and tracks. Instead of rainwater and rainwater distribution systems (clouds) you build pipes and tubes and plumbing and install pumps to move it all around. And you provide the plants nutrients in this way. And then you build a large shelter to keep everything away from the elements that mostly grow the plants outside. And then you install artificial lighting and electricity systems to pump energy into the solar panels that we know as leaves, to generate food.<p>For the longest time this has been hugely expensive. And to feed 7 billion people with about 2-3 plants or whatever it is, worth each day (in cereal, greens, fruits and legumes etc), you need to build billions of little plant homes.<p>And that was just never very economical. Let&#x27;s not forget that a hectare yields an average of about 5.000 kg of cereal. Wheat goes for about $200 per metric ton, so a hectare nets you about $1k.<p>Now that&#x27;s 107k square footage. That&#x27;s incredibly cheap. Now imagine you want to replace that with a hectare of factory or say the plant houses I described earlier. That&#x27;s a huge capex investment in the tens of millions compared to the hectare of soil which is priced around $10-15k and can be leased for a few hundred. To compete on price you&#x27;d need very high production in cheap economies of scale to offset your fixed costs on building this huge greenhouse structure with infrastructure for every individual plant.<p>But that&#x27;s also where the land is much cheaper. It&#x27;s virtually impossible to run vertical farms on soil, so you need a soilless medium which isn&#x27;t a problem, but it means you need plumbing to every plant. No biggie. But the same for light, you can&#x27;t do a vertical farm on scale (i.e. rows and rows) and expect sunshine to reach the bottom plants who sit in the shade. So you need artificial lighting and heating, and that&#x27;s very expensive compared to sunlight.<p>High value crops, sure it&#x27;s fine. (e.g. see every indoor weed farm with artificial lighting etc). But as the future of agriculture (where staple foods worldwide are cheap cereals, legumes, corn etc), no way.<p>Unless you have very large advances in material science (cheap, sturdy materials to pump out large greenhouses cheaply and sustainably) and energy (cheap solar pv/thermal, wind, geothermal). And that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re seeing now. So it&#x27;s definitely getting more appealing by the day and it&#x27;s something I&#x27;ve been very interested in pursuing because I just adore the idea of automated farming on some levels (I love to hike in nature, but large corn fields aren&#x27;t really nature to me and don&#x27;t excite me more than the idea of an automated corn factory!), but I still don&#x27;t see how the economics make sense.<p>And it&#x27;s more than finance, it&#x27;s touted as an environmental solution because these farms can be located near the point of consumption. But that&#x27;s just one part of the story, and incredibly myopic if it&#x27;s the only part of the story that&#x27;s considered. For example the problem in community supported agriculture I see is that people will drive a car individually, once a week, to a small location that doesn&#x27;t get economies of scale, to pick up a tiny amount of food. Because they&#x27;re under the impression it&#x27;s more environmentally friendly than a large shipping container moving their beans across the ocean. When in reality their food miles is a bit like saying it&#x27;s environmentally more friendly drive 2 miles to a store, than to cycle 5 miles to a store for your groceries because &#x27;it&#x27;s less food miles that way&#x27;. Sustainability is a very serious issue and I&#x27;m not entirely convinced such factory-style farming is more sustainable (see inherent investments to move from soil to building plant houses). In terms of water usage, it&#x27;s actually amazing to use a soilless medium, and water is one of this century&#x27;s biggest challenges. But in terms of materials and energy... I&#x27;m very skeptical.",1432477266

A subsistence income is <i>not</i> a substitute for a real return on that investment.<p>Rent control substantially limits the upside potential of that sort of investment <i>at best</i> and usually goes further to act as a massive wealth transfer from landlord to tenant.

People have bought pretty heavily into the current status quo that says, &quot;you eat what you kill&quot;. So, if you don&#x27;t work you are an undeserving freeloader or loafer.<p>Whereas, BI, for some, essentially acknowledges the common ownership of natural resources, etc., treating sustenance derived therefrom as more a natural right than something that must be earned.",1432476140

[...] After he got KVM access, the attacker convinced NFOrce that he was me (using his KVM access as part of his evidence) and said that he had locked himself out of the server. So NFOrce reset the server&#x27;s root password for him, giving him complete access to the server and bypassing most of our carefully-designed security measures...<p>Ugh. We need to remember that social engineering your ISP, hosting provider, etc. is a very real attack vector. Do not trust them.<p>Reminds me of the &quot;N&quot; twitter username story:

There will still be reasons to earn more income, especially with those who are capable of delivering value.<p>2. There is a fundamental assumption that we are at a technological stage where work can be automated. If there are not enough jobs that someone a standard deviation below average intelligence can fulfil, we could be coming upon a societal disaster.<p>If instead, we incentivize automation by saying, &quot;no job is a superior alternative to an easily automatable, low value job where people are treated as disposable,&quot; there is no significant conflict. If people with low skill do not choose to work, and their skills are automatable, it is only our moral qualms that get in the way.<p>As it is now, significant portions of the population cannot provide enough value to ensure their subsistence, minimum wage or otherwise. Is it only our morals that require some work from them?<p>3. Incentivizing not working also means incentivizing spending a year on an idea that could advance society, or works of art and literature. Harry Potter was written by someone who decided not to work. There might be major value to society that we&#x27;re losing because we <i>don&#x27;t</i> have a basic income.",1432476078

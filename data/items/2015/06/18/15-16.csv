Yes, from algorithmic point of view. Cool as hell. However, this has nothing to do with consciousness.<p>If anything, some of those images are just a more elaborate version of a kaleidoscope. It&#x27;s not like they run a network and got a drawing.

By aggressively optimizing something, you are probably diminishing many of the things that you are not explicitly optimizing for. Breeders are sensitive to farmers&#x27; (their customers&#x27;) demands and they are sensitive to supermarkets&#x27;.

9739356,comment,9737785,9738463,0,0,electronvolt,,,"> An example of where it fails in explaining code to the layperson is the part about compiling C code in the command line. Yes, a layperson could follow this step by step, but I think if they did they wouldn&#x27;t be able to put it in a larger context. Ok, it is compiled but what does that mean? How does that compare to other languages? These are questions that are left unanswered for laypeople, so it is just confusing and unrewarding.<p>I&#x27;m not sure this is a drawback to the article.  Compiled vs. interpreted and etc. etc. is a huge set of things to explain and would muddle the point.  Most laypeople probably aren&#x27;t interested in the hypertechnical details--do you read an article on what it&#x27;s like to do mathematics and come out wondering why they didn&#x27;t go into more depth explaining why functions over complex manifolds have interesting properties?  Is it not enough to say &quot;Ok, continuous functions over complex manifolds are interesting compared to the functions you learned in high school (like y=x^2+x+1) because they are restricted to certain behaviors, which makes them easy to predict&quot;?<p>In the end, the human story of &quot;What does Jim at the end of the hall do all day, anyways?&quot; or &quot;What do the people who make my phones/car/computer/life work do, anyways?&quot; or etc. is a lot more compelling and interesting than teaching the minutiae of &#x27;code&#x27; as an abstract idea in an article, so I doubt a nontechnical layperson leaves unsatisfied with the explanations in the article.  I don&#x27;t look for technical explanations in articles on chemistry or biology, either, since I know I don&#x27;t have the background to learn about them in what is well under a short book&#x27;s worth of material--I&#x27;m not sure why anyone else would, either.",1434642631

The quiet fraudster would not argue when you closed their account - they would just sign up again and try a different approach to get round your system.<p>* The loud fraudster (the vast majority of fraudsters). These come in all shapes and sizes. They were often the most obvious frauds (100 payments from the same IP at our max payment amount, within 10 minutes of each other). Unfortunately they sometimes came in the form of someone deluded - for example the man that sold &#x27;magic beans&#x27; that cured AIDS. These are the loud fraudsters because they will either shout down the phone at your support team (shouting never helps when calling support - by the way), or try and drum up negative PR to create pressure.<p>* The accidental fraudster. These people have good intentions, but are none-the-less breaking the rules. For example, migrating all of your customers over to a new payment supplier by filling out a new payment form on their behalf (note - I worked for a payment processor that was not based on cards - this method may be allowed for CC though I doubt it). The accidental fraudster might also have fraudulent customers paying them yet be a legit business - for example online sellers of jewellery will have a lot of people pay with stolen details hoping that the business will ship the goods before the payment is flagged. Sometimes you can work with the business to fix the issue, many times you have to let them go (remember, they will have all the signs of an obvious fraudster - so you have to be sure that their story is true).<p>* The innocent. As you can imagine, sometimes there are people that have all the signs of a fraudster yet are perfectly legitimate. There can be many reasons for this.<p>===<p>Without a lot more information, I cannot begin to speculate what category the author falls into - hopefully one of the latter two.<p>That said, as much as I love what Stripe in general, it is completely unacceptable for them not to have an escalated support/appeals process for fraud complaints. If they have made a mistake (which happens even with the best fraud systems), then they could be destroying a business that might have customers/employees/suppliers that are also relying on them to receive their payments on time.",1434642622

But an immigration system that allows people to come in as free and full citizens, without requiring them to have a specific academic background or have a job offer from a specific kind of company in a specific kind of position (tech, in this case), would do more to preserve the positive qualities of a free labor market than targeted, industry specific, role specific visas.<p>Let me give an example of what I mean.  Suppose that a country with a large and valuable market has a 100% protectionist tariff on all foreign grown fruits and vegetables.  The next day, the government removes tariffs on lemons <i>only</i>.  Would that lead to a freer market in fruits and vegetables?<p>Most likely what would happen is that anyone outside the borders seeking access to that market would start producing lemons, and anyone inside it would seek to start producing something that is still protected by tariffs.  Domestic production would collapse, imports would soar.<p>I think this is essentially what the US has done with IT.  We&#x27;ve created very specific visas for a narrow band of roles, under the assumption that there is a &quot;shortage&quot;.  Open borders are a political non-starter, but we could replace this with a lottery that allows people to come here as free and full participants in the labor market, welcome to choose whatever field they like.  This way, tech employers would have to actually compete in a free labor market.<p>My opinion, like a lot of people here, is that there really is no shortage, in the sense that aversion to tech careers may be very rational when you consider options available to people with the talent to do tech.  Without these visas, tech employers would actually have to compete with finance, law, medicine, nursing, and dental hygeine, and so forth to hire workers.<p>There is no reason immigration would need to subvert this, all we need to do is allow immigrants to come here as free citizens with choice, and not force them to study a particular field or work in a particular job role as a condition of coming here.",1434642390

Distribution of water is governed by a system of &quot;riparian rights&quot; that (in brief) have an all-you-can-use first-come-first-served basis, giving landowners farther upstream and closer to the waterworks greater ability to extract water. The result is that this system gives many farmers no incentive to minimize water use.<p>Currently, agriculture consumes most of the output of the state&#x27;s vast water engineering projects, especially to irrigate the Central Valley.

9739269,comment,9738580,9738580,0,0,6stringmerc,,,"Well, this is a new development. I will state that my personal experience is different than what is claimed here. With the distribution service I pay for / use, Apple Music was an &quot;opt-in&quot; service. My music can be on iTunes or Apple Music, or both. Different releases can be categorized as I see fit, at least for now.<p>So, I&#x27;m not sure the claim of &quot;will remove bands&quot; is entirely accurate. They might remove Brian Jonestown Massacre, but I&#x27;d like to have a good look at the contract they have with their record label, and the label has with Apple, before I expand such a claim. Maybe Newcombe doesn&#x27;t know that it&#x27;s a bargaining position between his label (or affiliated labels) and Apple...because while he&#x27;s obviously really, really mad, I&#x27;m unsure if I believe his situation is entirely representative of the entire sphere of musicians out to make some money in this arena. In other words, maybe he signed a bad contract and should go yell at the mirror for a little while just to be fair.<p>While I&#x27;m on this soapbox, I&#x27;d also like to point out that unless Newcombe has a contractual obligation to his label to have music on iTunes, then pack up and leave. Go join TIDAL on principle. Or, even more to his point about wanting to get paid, go exclusively with Bandcamp and set the sales price to $50 per track. Take a stand, show the world - <i>actions speak louder than words</i> is an old but good expression for cases like this.<p>Again, unless the contract he/they signed handcuffs their decision making, there are a lot of options other than ranting at a behemoth retailer with a significant market share. Do I work for Apple or even use iTunes personally? Nope. Do I like getting pennies from Spotify versus some pretty decent revenue from iTunes or Amazon? Not particularly. I&#x27;ve marched down my own path as an independent who doesn&#x27;t make a living in music, mostly because I&#x27;ve never wanted to try making a living in music. It&#x27;s a ridiculously hard industry, and I dislike living in poverty quite a bit.<p>It will be interesting to see what the &#x27;investigations&#x27; turn up regarding Apple&#x27;s negotiating tactics and behavior during this process. Many people understand they&#x27;re sitting on a giant pile of off-shore, un-taxed cash...and believe the company could pay artists / labels / meat popsicles like me for every listener&#x27;s 3 months worth of royalties without a catastrophic impact to its business. But, like with those billions of dollars, I&#x27;m also aware that Apple&#x27;s mentality seems to be &quot;We don&#x27;t want to pay, and if we don&#x27;t have to pay, we won&#x27;t pay.&quot; I don&#x27;t like it, but I&#x27;m not remotely surprised by it.",1434641982

Hospitals and medical centers are using this too, according to the Chrome for Work pages. A doctor says, &quot;Ok, Google had a lot of results about new HLA-B27 research,&quot; when discussing a patient&#x27;s arthritic concerns, while proceeding to outline the patient&#x27;s symptoms and how treatment should proceed and now we&#x27;re looking at a potential HIPAA Privacy Rule violation.<p>As I type this, I look over at my Amazon Echo, and I&#x27;m reminded of something I heard once.

AVS checks only the numeric portion of the street address and postal code, and returns a code indicating whether AVS is supported and whether one or both of the numbers match the ones on file with the card issuer.<p>Stripe supports AVS the same as other processors. Whether you choose to reject cards that don&#x27;t pass AVS is up to you: it&#x27;s a setting. So is which of the codes you want to reject. That&#x27;s the case at every payment processor I&#x27;ve used. Different businesses, collecting cards in different scenarios, are going to have different risk profiles and different needs. If you&#x27;re running a store selling computers to strangers over the internet, you probably want full AVS in addition to other fraud checks. If you&#x27;re taking an invoice payment from another business you&#x27;ve worked with for years, you might not want to bother collecting and verifying an address.",1434641774

I tried using my own credit card with a fake name. Surprise, it went through. I emailed Stripe support. After half a dozen emails discussing CC authorization I learned that Stripe <i>does not</i> and <i>can not</i> validate Name & Address on credit card.<p>Stripe told me that Credit Card companies do not disclose this data to Payment Processors like Stripe. Thus, Stripe simply passes on the name & address to the CC API.<p>Interestingly enough, Name & Address are NOT validated by major credit card companies. You can use junk names on your name & billing address and that will NOT stop your credit card transaction from going through.<p>Try for yourself next time you order something online. Makes me wonder why they even collect the data in the first place...<p><i></i>",1434641330

In this case we simply feed the network an arbitrary image or photo and let the network analyze the picture. We then pick a layer and ask the network to enhance whatever it detected. Each layer of the network deals with features at a different level of abstraction, so the complexity of features we generate depends on which layer we choose to enhance. For example, lower layers tend to produce strokes or simple ornament-like patterns, because those layers are sensitive to basic features such as edges and their orientations.<p>Specifically, what does &quot;we then pick a layer and ask the network to enhance whatever it detected&quot; mean?<p>I understand that different layers deal with features at different levels of abstraction and how that corresponds with the different kinds of hallucinations shown, but how does it actually work?

Thus, they stick with anything that&#x27;s Java.<p>I went to the DevNexus conference and a person in the audience asked the presenter:<p>&quot;Why do things like Rails, and Python exist? Why don&#x27;t people use Java and Spring for everything?&quot;<p>Now this is an isolated anecdote, but it gives you an idea of the state of Java developers. They tend not to go outside their comfort zone to learn new tech.<p>The presenter mentioned that they are actually trying to take the Rails asset pipeline, and implement it into Spring. Something that has existed for years in Rails, is just now making its way into Spring.<p>I want to also highlight that certain things are just not possible because of statically typed languages like Java. Dynamic languages are a lot more flexible.<p>Another talk I attended at DevNexus was called &quot;Framework Fanboys&quot;.

The scientific establishment was not wrong about the danger of high fat diets.  This has been demonstrated over and over.  What the establishment got wrong was that they didn&#x27;t predict the extent to which people would replace fats with sugars in their diets. Another point I think it&#x27;s really important to make is that a lot of the argument about low fat or low carb is academic and I think harmful.  We&#x27;ve known for years that a low calorie, low fat diet that&#x27;s high in fiber and consists of lots of fruits and vegetables is healthy and can contribute to losing excess weight.  We&#x27;ve recently learned that some people find it easier to lose weight with a low-carb diet, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that the establishment view is wrong.  I think this debate over which is better is harmful because some people get the idea that science doesn&#x27;t know what&#x27;s healthy and what&#x27;s not, so they say to themselves &quot;why bother listening to anything they say?&quot;.  This becomes especially problematic when people conflate the statements &quot;high carb diets are unhealthy&quot; with &quot;any diet not high in carbohydrates is healthy&quot;, or similarly &quot;high fat diets are unhealthy&quot; with &quot;any diet not high in fat is healthy&quot;.",1434640727

My first &quot;real&quot; job was with a mega shipping corp supporting software for logistics and the autosorting equipment. I made 40k a year which was a lot of money to me in 2006. I worked 12 hour shifts rotating shifts (3 on 3 off which was nice). No holidays off. I wasn&#x27;t allowed to leave my desk without a phone. Was once told I was required to answer the phone while on the toilet. Often the 12 hours became more than 20 hours because my manager demanded you own an issue if it came in during your shift. We switched to rotating 8 hour shifts but still ended up working way more than 40 hours per week and not sleeping. I had way more responsibility than I should have had at that pay scale. I also should have been paid hourly. I&#x27;m sure there are tons of people in that situation. To your point I decided to leave.<p>There is a side of the industry that most high paid developers don&#x27;t see. Maybe they would just chock that up to lack of skills? I make double that now and average over 40 hours still. Plus travel, living out of hotels, and losing money on food while traveling. I still think I&#x27;m better off in Ohio at my current rate than in the valley at 50% more.<p>Overall IT is a good career even though it can be high stress. Most of the time that stress is unnecessary or even manufactured by managers/organizations. I really think the exempt employee is exploited in tech in general. There is no reason a help desk employee should be considered exempt. They should be paid by the hour with overtime.  That and non-compete agreements are one reason I would even entertain the idea of a union. When a non-compete basically says you can&#x27;t work anywhere then something is wrong.<p>Full disclosure: most of my family are union construction workers so that could sway my opinion. They have better compensation than I do, especially if you break it down by actually hours working.

Traditional hoteliers have to keep maintaining empty rooms in the event the industry picks back up, or build more rooms if the industry is at a high. On the flip-side, AirBnB can be sensitive to local regulations and property owners might simply decide to not have their place up for rent, making availability a slight risk.<p>To put this valuation into perspective, Marriott International has a Mkt Cap of $21.5B They&#x27;re the 3rd largest hotel group on the planet and own something like 125,000 rooms.<p>Airbnb claims 1,000,000 listings, but owns none.

While I&#x27;m sure that their PR contributed to their success (as all successful adverts help sell products), if Apple&#x27;s products weren&#x27;t also done to a high quality then their adverts wouldn&#x27;t have made a difference. So I will always credit Apple for releasing well polished products. But in any case, I wasn&#x27;t commenting about the success of Apple nor their products.<p>My complaint is that the incremental improvements that Apple bring to the industry - regardless of how sleek they may be - isn&#x27;t itself innovation. And I&#x27;m saying that their proprietary efforts are actually a relatively minor part of their wider software stack. But obviously being the front end, it&#x27;s what people recognise as being &quot;Apple&quot; so all of the fundamental open source components that power iPhones and Macbook Pros get forgotten about.<p>I guess if were to argue that I was having an emotional response to anything, it would be that the true innovators of the technology we use get forgotten about. eg the creators of the programming language C - for without which there wouldn&#x27;t be Objective C or Java. Or the creators of UNIX, for without which we wouldn&#x27;t have Mach or Linux. In many ways, Dennis Ritchie contributed more to the technology that powers our smartphones than Apple and Google have, yet his death was a footnote only noticed by us geeks.<p>But I&#x27;m drifting massively off topic now.",1434639955

You might find a similar vintage Subaru for hundreds of dollars less, but the risk of swapping an old car you know for one you don&#x27;t to extract a few hundred dollars makes no sense. One repair could wipe that out several times over. Moreover, this car is probably paid for. They might have to finance a replacement at very unfavorable rates.",1427720386

Some guy rambling about stuff, advertising himself or his social media presence, while slowly setting up whatever the actual point of the video is. Possibly this is because editing takes skill (which most people don&#x27;t have) and tooling (video editing software is hard and/or expensive).<p>The last time I had to get information out of a video because there was no other source was for a minor car repair issue. It was useful to <i>see</i> which screws to undo and how the parts come apart and go back together.

I didn&#x27;t say what I meant to say.<p>What I meant to say is that the idea includes an estimate of how likely it is that you&#x27;ll successfully build and sell the product. An idea where you could reasonably assume a high likelihood of being able to successfully build and sell your product is good (or rather it has a few components of being good). An idea that meets some of the requirements of being good, but that doesn&#x27;t have a reasonable chance at being able to be built and sold isn&#x27;t a good idea.<p>I think that these estimates may have a rather large confidence interval in some cases, and that in these cases the team is extra important. But I also think that there do exist ideas that have a high likelihood of success with a narrow confidence interval, and that in these cases the team is less important (but still important, for the reasons that are well accepted). And so, I think it makes sense to look at it as a case-by-case, rather than saying more broadly that &quot;ideas don&#x27;t matter&quot;.",1427720268

the steel beams are the blueprint of the skyscraper....<p>I&#x27;ll take the TL;DR at face value since it was written by the author.  The statement completely obliterates the entire concept of a blueprint or plan.  By that reasoning, it is true everything is its own blueprint, and the concept has no meaning (of course this is a standard tautology).<p>And, simply nodding to CYA documents (for when the customers/end users come back saying that your product doesn&#x27;t do X), or to docs for when formal proofs are needed, doesn&#x27;t cover the concept.<p>The point of planning (or blueprinting) is to <i>think</i> about what you are going to build <i>before</i> you get out the tools, abstracted away from the specific tools that you&#x27;ll use, and to then record and communicate those thoughts to all the stakeholders.  It doesn&#x27;t have to be a complete formal, engraved-in-stone blueprint, but a modest amount of actual thinking and planning goes a loooong way.<p>I&#x27;ve often found that with a little thought, we&#x27;ll use a different tool than originally expected.  If you expect to just dive in and sort it out in your source code, then you&#x27;ve already a priori restricted your choice of tool, and probably also your library, algorithm, etc.  (of course if you only have or know one tool then, well, &#x27;everything looks like a nail and who needs a blueprint?&#x27;).<p>Without planning, you&#x27;ll get what grows out of the first thing that comes to mind, not the best thing you could build.  The mere fact that it manages to run or stand is not a defense of the bad process.<p>Planning is where the real thinking takes place.  Sure, if all you want to do is exercise your programming skills and avoid thinking, then don&#x27;t plan.  But don&#x27;t pretend that no one else should think or plan, or complain when someone else presents a plan to which you are expected to build  (and don&#x27;t be surprised 10 years on when you don&#x27;t advance as far as you expected).",1427718660

With ever other language and toolkit I&#x27;ve ever worked with, the tutorial starts with opening up a text editor, writing some code, and producing a lousy, &quot;Hello World&quot; website.  With Rails, I went through three pages of the tutorial before I even saw a single line of Ruby. I grew to hate the &quot;generate&quot; command, as it produced ever expanding reams of unexplained code each time the tutorial had me call it.<p>I had always assumed that the elimination of the need for commands like &quot;generate&quot; would be the top priority of the Ruby community and that their existence was a recognized design wart, like Python&#x27;s GIL or Haskell&#x27;s unsafe prelude.

Perhaps I haven&#x27;t been clear about some of the points I&#x27;m making, which I don&#x27;t think are all that contentious.<p>I&#x27;m not saying a fast GC can reduce the cost of allocation.  I&#x27;m saying a fast GC can reduce GC overhead.  I think that&#x27;s an uncontroversial statement.  I can only insist so many times that Java&#x27;s GC doesn&#x27;t touch dead objects at any time during its scan.  If you want to disagree with me, that is your prerogative.<p>I agree that a GC walk can thrash cache when it happens.  However, a copying GC can also rearrange object layout to improve locality.  Which effect is more significant depends on the workload.<p>I didn&#x27;t mention the number of cores because it didn&#x27;t occur to me that it was significant to you.  GCs can scale just fine to many cores.  No core has to &quot;check&quot; other cores: each core can check its own local data, depending on the tactics employed to deal with NUMA.  There are always challenges in scaling any parallel workload, of course, and there are always solutions.<p>Our GC (in IBM&#x27;s J9 JVM) uses 8 bits in each object.  With classes aligned to 256 bytes, there are eight free bits in each object&#x27;s class pointer.  Hence, J9&#x27;s object model has one word of overhead on top of the user&#x27;s data, which is what malloc/free typically needs to track each object&#x27;s size anyway.  No disadvantage there.<p>[These are my personal opinions, not those of my employer.]",1427718583

And even if it is, the builder takes plenty of latitude in constructing the building.  For example, the way that builders pick nails isn&#x27;t by accounting for humidity levels or type of wood they use (older pressure-treated wood can corrode certain metals faster, same as newer wood can corrode others.)  Instead, most of them just grab what they have, so when nails start failing after a few decades that&#x27;s not their problem.  Not like the architect said to use all galvanized nails everywhere.<p>But I digress. Here is how bricklayers and programmers are similar: they commonly work in the vacuum of their own workspace, without awareness of the environment that impacts their projects.  So once the projects are launched, they&#x27;re impacted by things that weren&#x27;t accounted for.<p>If the foundation is too weak, the brick wall will sag.  If nearby trees grow too close to the wall, the wall will bow inward or outward.  If someone builds on top of the brick wall and doesn&#x27;t reinforce it over 8 feet, the inspector will condemn the work.  The bricklayers are paid to just lay bricks, so they won&#x27;t care about the nearby trees, they won&#x27;t care about the foundation, they won&#x27;t care about what you put on top of the wall.<p>Programmers will build the project to spec, and come launch time, not account for a particular load signature because that was never their concern. Seen that time and time again.  Substitute foundation for baseline server power, trees for amount of interrupting processes and meddling managers altering the original program at random, and you have a pretty reasonable comparison to bricklaying.",1427717647

3365330,comment,3355957,3356991,1,0,brc,,,"My suggestion is stop laying and wondering and start reading.  Economics and finance is a fascinating topic if you want to truly understand the history and theory of money and finance.<p>I don't mean boning up on company reports (though the ability to read and understand them is a good life skill) but rather truly trying to understand what money is, what it means, why so many apparent paradoxes exist.<p>To wit; wealth is not a zero sum game.  Hard numbers like valuations come about just from an agreement at a point in time, which are just the opinions of two people at a flash in history.  Even the value of a dollar in your wallet is a massively volatile thing in terms of what you can purchase with it.<p>A good jumping off point is Niall Fergusons 'The History of Money' (book or video).  Get through that and then decide which of the sub-themes you want to delve into further.",1324162663

3365325,comment,3364437,3365055,2,0,billpatrianakos,,,"I have to play devil's advocate here because what you said is interesting.<p>Why do we not want corporations in control? Does using their software give them real control? How so and how much?<p>Now once you've answered those questions you then must ask yourself, if the creators of the software used by government agencies has the ability to control those agencies then who <i>should</i> be ""in control""?<p>If only free software was used like Stallman wants then we're just shifting control from one group to another. What's to say that Stallman and the FSF can and will only do good?<p>Make no mistake here, even though Linux and other free software is driven by the community that doesn't mean there aren't cases where a single developer works alone and releases something as GPL. In addition, while you can always add to a free project the developer has final say of what makes it in and what to leave out. You can put out your own version but if you don't have enough clout then it's unlikely your better version gets used. If Linux was used in government then Stallman has control. If they use Red Hat then they have control. I think Red Hat is an interesting example because while they're free they can still be just as manipulative as any large corporation if they wanted to.<p>Doesn't it make sense that if you don't want anyone to be ""in control"" of government agencies through the use of certain software then those agencies would need to roll their own at every level. In the end we're all beholden to the developer whether the software is free or proprietary.",1324162449

When you outgrow your currently solution, the next step I'd take is use your PHP solution to pass the mail request to a mail service provider. That will give you the most bang for your buck without added complexity.<p>If you're feeling really brave and really want to roll your own solution, try to find a way to cheaply create a HTTP POST interface that you could point your form at to process your request. A python/django instance could do this but might be a lot of overhead for just a mail processor, for example.<p>Just don't try to over engineer it. :)",1324160093

But governments aside, what happens when person A takes a picture of person B who is sharing lunch with them, and behind them at a booth is Person C having a lunch with person D who should not be associating with person C. The tool picks up both person C and D's face and tags three recognizable people, B, C, and D in the photo.

I dislike some of the malicious code he talks about and I also believe it is important to be able to view source. But we already have that without the FSF. This belief that all software should be free (as in liberty free) is unacceptable. We should be able to choose what happens to our work. There is a place in this world for both types of software. I love OS X. Now, it doesn't matter whether you like it or not too, what matters here is that I really don't think that the FOSS community could have built something as wonderful as that OS without the resources of a large company. Ubuntu is great and comes closest to being a real replacement for proprietary OSes but the design of the Mac and the whole ecosystem that Stallman hates is actually an incentive to choose it! I love the walled garden of the iTunes, app store, and Mac platform in general because it gives me everything I need. I don't cry about not being able to modify or see the code and Im happy to pay because I get a ton of value from it.<p>On the other hand I also have a Linux machine. I love switching distros frequently, using the free software that comes with it and being able to mod my system however I want.<p>My point is that eradicating proprietary software hurts people just as much as if we were to eradicate the FOSS movement. People choose their platform based on what they're able to do. Most users aren't programmers and prefer Windows or Mac over Linux because it's well known, easy, and gets the job done. I'm glad we have FOSS too though. Why can't the two coexist? Why is proprietary always evil? What's wrong with making money? As it stands we're living in an amazing time where we have the best of both worlds and both sides are playing to their strengths in the greatest of ways.",1324159623

3365232,comment,3361181,3363012,1,0,mikegreenberg,,,"Let's put the ""interview"" part of this aside. I think the biggest problem here is anxiety. There's a lot riding on the outcome of this conversation and that makes you choke. I suffer similarly and, agreeing with the other reply, practice is what it takes! There's a particular frame of mind that you can develop which turns these ""interviews"" into just another conversation. For me, the easiest way I was able to achieve this was by doing a lot of interviews.<p>Go to college job boards and blanket apply to everything. Learn what they are looking for in their hire and try your hardest to come across as that person. You don't have to lie. But applying for a job which you're not qualified (even remotely) will do a few things for you:<p>a) Most importantly, you don't care if you fumble. Enough rounds of not caring will become habit-forming after some time. The goal of these interviews is not to get the job. (A job offer will always help your ego, but you'll also learn how to say ""no"" and politely decline opportunities which aren't inline with your goals....another really helpful skill.) The primary goal is to help you stop caring about the outcome and focusing more about the conversation and providing value to the interviewer. They could be asking you about programming languages which you're not familiar with, but what's to stop you from sharing your interest in learning new languages and offering relevant anecdotes that communicate the value that you suspect the interviewer is looking for. (The skill here is reading people and understanding conversation flow.)<p>b) You'll improve your awareness of what companies are actually looking for in a developer. You'll learn where to best focus your time... what technologies, what tools are they using, what algorithms they are interested in, etc... Job descriptions aren't always reflective of what they are really looking for and talking with companies directly will help flesh these details out for you and give you a better professional roadmap than any university could give you.<p>c) You'll also learn that being a good developer isn't just about knowing algorithms and tools. Really good software engineers know how to put systems together in non-obvious ways. Being able to design solutions around impossible problems is a skill EVERYONE needs. Interviewers will constantly try to challenge you to understand your methodology and approach to solving these problems. ""How many gas stations are optimal in a city?"" ""What is the optimal placement of a parked elevator in a 10-story building?"" ""What if there are two elevators? How does your algorithm change?"" These questions can be tough, but practice will be the equalizer you need to really do well.<p>Some people might feel like this creates a lot of overhead for interviewers and is bad form. I completely disagree. But that's another conversation altogether. Hope this gives you some food for thought. Follow questions are welcome.",1324159464

The team included the best programmers I knew in the city, and the CEO was (is) the best person at picking talent I've ever known. I believed, and still do believe, that people are the most important thing, so I wasn't too worried about whether the initial idea would work out. A good team would simply adapt, and this was going to be the best team I'd ever been on.<p>It didn't work out that way at all because the leader turned out to be... well, if I described how he was, you might not believe me. So let's just say I learned a lesson: the ability to find good people and the ability to lead them are two completely different things, and you can have one without the other. This team never had a chance to get off the ground.<p>This doesn't contradict what you're saying, but for me it's an important thing to add to the ""put great people first"" approach.",1225809916

When you read a Rand novel, you don't learn anything about how objectivism works, you only learn about Rand's imagination of how it works.  Similarly, sentience may in fact be mutually inclusive or exclusive of understanding; just because you can describe a circumstance in which something is true doesn't mean it can ever be true.<p>This doesn't mean that fiction is useless for learning about the world.  It just means that fiction does not contain the tools necessary to decide if something is true (or accurate, or possible).

Probably worth it even in purely financial terms since some of what I read is job-related, but the main reason is that I (1) enjoy reading and (2) have omniscience as a primary goal in life.<p>I usually have several books on the go at once.

353444,comment,353222,353409,0,0,wagerlabs,,,"> Did you really write your whole server code in Erlang?<p>Yes. I started with Lisp but realized I didn't know how to scale it. Then I tried Erlang, thought it scales automatically and finally realized that it's still a lot of work and careful analysis of your architecture.<p>I wrote another version of my poker server in Lisp in the past few weeks and it's almost complete. I know how to scale it now but see no point in pursuing it. I wrote it as a way of relieving my frustration with Erlang, a way of moving forward, even by taking a step back.<p>> Your intelligence scares me a little bit.<p>Thanks! If was as smart as you think, I would have been rich by the age of 30 and I'm not.<p>> First off, can you elaborate on what these ""social network"" features are?<p>I don't know, actually, I haven't given it much thought. I did google for poker social network and found that existing sites are forums without any ability to play poker.<p>I see my site as a friendly place to play poker, one you can customize and tailor to your needs and wants.<p>> 1. Why will your poker program be unique?<p>Beats me. It's not unique at all. It didn't have a poker client for a couple of years, I'm just finishing up tournaments and there's only Texas Hold'em at the moment.<p>Once upon a time, a sportsbook and casino in the Caribbean commissioned poker software. I was running an offshore development shop from my apartment at the time (NYC and then Atlanta). I outsourced development to Russia. The sportsbook fired their top management because their software could not handle the load during football season.<p>The sportsbook then dropped custom developed software entirely and went with off-the-shelf solutions. That's how I ended up with buggy PC-based poker software written in Delphi. I'm still kicking myself not not forcing development in C++. Devs said it would cost much more (Delphi specialists them) and I capitulated.<p>I thought I could do better myself and wrote OpenPoker.<p>> 2. How will you achieve critical mass (what's your distribution channel/marketing)?<p>Word of mouth and slow growth.<p>> 3. How will you stop your competitors from stealing your idea and implementing them with their existing user base?<p>There aren't that many scalable poker servers to go around. Also, most of the competitors are huge real money poker servers. I looked at gPokr but I think I can do better.<p>> 1. There are plenty of people trying to solve the multiplayer problem (my company for example)<p>I'm available for consulting.<p>> and we would love to buy some sort of license to custom code written to handle generic server requests.<p>What are generic server requests? Are they binary? JSON? UDP? TCP?<p>> Then you can package your Poker software on top of that as a ""demo"". But if you go this route, you really need to redo your server in a more traditional language, Erlang is fun for show and tell, but not very practical for the masses.<p>What is a more traditional language? Python? Java? C? C++?<p>> I would recommend making a Ning for Poker Sites. There are so many poker sites out there right now that it doesn't make sense to try and compete with all of them.<p>Great idea, thanks! Hosted white-label poker.",1225809401

I was five, and I just haven't stopped reading since.  I'll be 38 in a couple of months.<p>I'm reading <i>Wise Blood</i> by Flannery O'Connor, because O'Connor is wicked and funny.  Favorite book?  As others have pointed out, this is a ridiculous question -- my favorite kind!  Some books I love: <i>Lolita</i>, <i>As I Lay Dying</i>, <i>The Ghost Writer</i>, <i>Goodbye, Columbus</i>, <i>Blood Meridian</i>, <i>Anna Karenina</i>,  <i>Where I'm Calling From</i>, <i>Huck Finn</i>, <i>Dubliners</i> and on and on.  I read mostly literary novels, but I read fairly widely -- genre stuff (skiffy, crime), history, philosophy, pop science, whatever's good.  I average around 1 book per week, but I read in jags and sometimes go a couple of weeks without reading anything but blogs and news.<p>I'm sure there are any number of studies that will show the benefit of reading, but I much prefer to classify books with whiskey and cigarettes.  How do you measure the utility of whiskey and cigarettes?  I like the Romantic idea that books are bad for you.  You know, the kind of thing that destroyed Emma Bovary and robbed Señor Quixote of his sanity.  Maybe I just need to manufacture a vice.

353432,comment,352568,353171,0,0,jerf,,,"You keep saying ""complexity"". There's a reason I keep writing ""K-complexity"". The extra <i>K-complexity</i> comes from the extra bits needed to narrow down the results. The whole multiverse does have <i>English-complexity</i> (the conventional meaning of the word, not the measure of how many words it takes to describe something which would just be K-complexity again) greater than the part... but English-complexity is ill-defined.<p>Look at a word-processing document. A real one, sitting on your hard drive. The program to output all possible documents is very, very simple. The specification of how to get to the exact document you are looking it is the (compressed) size of the document itself. The English-complexity of ""the set of all word processing documents"" is high, but the K-complexity is low. The English-complexity of ""one particular document"" is low, but the K-complexity is quite high.<p>You might say, ""Well, I simply tell you to simulate the multiverse, then hand you instructions on how to get to that document"", but the instructions will be of a very non-trivial size. I think you intuitively see the instructions as very small, but they are actually huge. Starting with just ""Simulate the multiverse"" leaves me with, quite literally, a multiverse in hand. Now what? Now how do I find what you are talking about? I'm worse off than when I had nothing at all!<p>When you have a gigantic set, simply the act of indicating a member within it takes bits. K-complexity measures those bits. English-complexity says you're lowering the complexity. <i>Neither is wrong</i>... it's a definitional matter.",1225808916

Once you're done, you get the huge sense of accomplishment and it can be a drag to go back and add massive amounts of documentation to what you've just done (not comments, I mean a developer guide for the next guy).",1225807558

Your intelligence scares me a little bit.<p>First off, can you elaborate on what these ""social network"" features are? There is a really popular poker FB application already, that seems to me to have ""social network"" features.<p>I think that there are a number of questions you should answer before you embark on this journey.<p>1. Why will your poker program be unique?<p>2. How will you achieve critical mass (what's your distribution channel/marketing)?<p>3. How will you stop your competitors from stealing your idea and implementing them with their existing user base?<p>------------------------------------<p>As for how I think you can make money? I think that you are a very intelligent person, much more than me, and you should leverage that to your advantage.<p>Here are two ways I think you can make a lot more money than just simply running a consumer product:<p>1. There are plenty of people trying to solve the multiplayer problem (my company for example) and we would love to buy some sort of license to custom code written to handle generic server requests. Then you can package your Poker software on top of that as a ""demo"". But if you go this route, you really need to redo your server in a more traditional language, Erlang is fun for show and tell, but not very practical for the masses.<p>2. If you are adamant on doing a poker related site with your stuff. I would recommend making a Ning for Poker Sites. There are so many poker sites out there right now that it doesn't make sense to try and compete with all of them. It does make sense to setup the backbone to run poker sites, take a cut of the money processing, and then let everyone else figure out how to market and distribute your stuff. There is currently no free poker software that is easy to skin and market, you can be the first, you can undercut everyone and be a millionaire by this time next year.",1225807367

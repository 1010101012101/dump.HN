This is what I have tried so far.<p>- Meet bloggers from popular media companies in events around the bay area.
- Cold call these companies.
- Email them.
- Email to online networks/newsgroups that I am a member of.<p>
None of it has worked for us.<p>Also what's the best way to follow up once you  get a lead?<p>Thanks a lot for reading this,<p>-Manu.",1195451385

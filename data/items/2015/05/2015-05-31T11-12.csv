The  problem with office docs was due to lack of documentation not because they were binary.<p>When you&#x27;re parsing text, all kinds of crazy stuff can happen. You need to resize buffers as you read data, you need to know the escaping rules of each field, you need to know about line continuations, you have to know the text encoding, and many many other things.<p>Binary data in the abstract form has three elements: tag/type (may be inferred from position), data length (may be inferred from tag) and optional data itself. There are various ways to compose that information, but that&#x27;s it otherwise. Binary protocols may be harder to read for people (you can just use wireshark dissectors though), but writing a correct and bug free de/encoder for one is massively simpler than for a text one.<p>By design, every text protocol will require more documentation than binary, because you need to include information about data escaping and encoding.<p>If you want to see this in practice, implement a client for something which does support both options. I recommend memcache.",1433073483

9633881,comment,9633352,9633700,0,0,CHY872,,,"You&#x27;re at least over-optimistic (certainly more wrong than GP).<p>How are you measuring the performance of the app, then? Depending on your software, it might be throughput, it might be latency, it might be failure-related, etc etc.<p>The means with which the computer is supposed to work out &#x27;oh, this app should be tuned for latency&#x27; is missing; and in many cases they can&#x27;t know it (data-dependent etc). That&#x27;s the hard bit. You have no way of working out &#x27;better&#x27;.<p>Even if you have a good metric (user specified etc) you&#x27;re still going to suffer, because there are many failure modes you won&#x27;t have thought of. For example, say you&#x27;re running an application and a database. It could easily be the case that the database taking too much memory slows the application down, and improves average latency by reducing contention. That would be a positive for the database, but a negative overall.
So, you&#x27;d need to have overall knowledge of a system. Then things get really complicated.<p>Where stuff can be optimised programatically, it generally already is; there&#x27;s no setting for it. For example, the JIT settings in most runtimes are not exposed to the user (unless they dig deep). The remaining configuration settings should be things that the system can&#x27;t deduce itself, and so needs to be told.<p>Trying to &#x27;optimise&#x27; this without knowing what needs to be optimised is silly.",1433073223

9633876,comment,9632535,9633152,0,0,tenfingers,,,"It&#x27;s unpopular currently, mostly because most of the distributed bug trackers mentioned use vcs-based storage without a public-facing frontent. Even as a developer, it&#x27;s nice to being able to see/report bugs without having to fiddle with VCS commands.<p>But don&#x27;t dismiss them.<p>Fossil, which is not strictly a distributed tracker but rather an entire source-control system, is still maintained and very active. Several popular projects use it. And you do get distributed issue tracking for free.<p>BE is actually pretty mature. Development has stalled, but you have an email and web interface along with a pretty extensive bug manager which is certainly more advanced than Github issues. When configured with git, it&#x27;s easy to chose where bug storage should be in-branch or use a dedicated branch.<p>Using the VCS itself to store data has its advantages. As the early proliferation of projects showed, implementing a distributed bug tracker on top of a distributed VCS is almost trivial. The truth is that if github added support to embed issues in BE format under a dedicated branch, BE would become massively popular.<p>Then you also have SimpleDefects (SD), which actually implements his own distributed database, web interface (which I&#x27;m using) and a bi-directional syncronization plugin system. Way harder to implement, and it&#x27;s not surprising that SD is less mantained than BE, even though it would hold much more promise (a github issues sync plugin exists, but has bitrotted).<p>SD, in its current state, is also more featured than github issues.<p>Give these projects a spin. Contributing to BugsEverywhere in particular is <i>not</i> hard.",1433072980

9633831,comment,9633252,9633252,0,0,daanavitch,,,"That&#x27;s a coincidence, yesterday I have been trying to make an Agar.io clone in Node.js. There are some problems I&#x27;ve stumbled upon which aren&#x27;t mentioned in this article:<p>- The original Agar.io server client doesn&#x27;t send raw text data through the WebSocket, it sends compressed binary data. Agar.io sends packets of max 187 bytes on my computer. The Agar.io clone sends packets of a staggering 4253 bytes of raw JSON data on my computer, with only me playing! On a real-time game like this, where the user should receive immediate feedback on their actions, this is way too large. Unfortunately I wasn&#x27;t able to decode the data Agar.io is sending, so I don&#x27;t really know how they do it. Maybe they only send data for each player&#x27;s region of interest? Or maybe they send the data for each player individually? I think that should be a decent enough solution because we can send as many small packets of data as we want over the WebSocket. We don&#x27;t have to receive all player&#x27;s locations at once.<p>I took a look at sending binary data over the WebSocket with Javascript, but it&#x27;s not as easy as enabling compression, because you really have to think about the data types you&#x27;re going to use, you can&#x27;t just send a variable length JSON as binary data (please correct me if I&#x27;m wrong).<p>- The original Agar.io game processes no game logic on the client side, which makes the game freeze completely once the server lags. Most online games solve this by letting the client run game logic, but letting the server correct the client&#x27;s position when he is cheating.<p>This method creates a whole different problem when the client receives data from the server from a position from some time ago. The client can&#x27;t just correct the player&#x27;s position just like that, or on slow networks the player would constantly be sent back to an earlier position.

Do not confuse a server that never reboots, with a system that never stops.<p>For example the AWS services integrate metrics to define behaviors (scale up, scale down, etc), you can implement pretty convenient autotuning algorithms, even those that learn from previous metrics.<p>The Linux kernel networking and I/O layers are plenty of autotuning code. Powertop is just another example maybe. Even a perl interpreter makes some dark magic.<p>If I think on my own systems implementation, I think I have do noob autotuning too (alert control, alert frequency, recovery steps, recovery notification... systems increasing their swap before a cron runs, dynamic filtering tables based on app/network input, sysctl autotuning daemons.... etc...)<p>There are too much to improve regarding autonomous systems, but autotuning is just about programing programmable components, for react on events. Depending on those components, you have to coordinate some kind of events or very different ones. From IRQ interrupts, to a cache hit in the other end of the connection, there are a plenty of parts to implement autotuning, from many vendors, and maybe, this is the root of the issue.",1433070322
9633803,comment,9633161,9633553,0,0,arthurfm,,,"I agree! Many of the SSD &quot;tweaks&quot; mentioned are unnecessary and seem to originate from the early days of consumer SSDs (2007-early 2009). For some bizarre reason they still perpetuate and I am not sure why.<p>Disabling the browser cache is a good example. Back then we had many drives based on JMicron&#x27;s infamous JMF602 controller such as the G.Skill Titan and Apex, Core v2 & Solid from OCZ. Once thing these all had in common were incredibly poor random 4KB write latencies of between 0.5-2 seconds [1][2] which understandably lead to frequent pauses or stuttering in the operating system. The general advice in these cases was to move the browser cache to a HDD or RAM disk in addition to disabling or moving the pagefile. I am not sure why but many people seemed happy with this solution. If I had purchased an SSD that exhibited this problem I would have returned it to the place of purchase for a full refund since they clearly weren&#x27;t fit for purpose and shouldn&#x27;t have been sold in the first place!<p>Item 17 isn&#x27;t true [3]. Windows 7 onwards will detect solid state drives and will make the necessary adjustments itself (including disabling defrag <i>just</i> for the SSD). What many of these guides fail to mention is that if you completely disable defrag you are also disabling the automatic defragmentation of any HDDs that are connected to the same computer. Also, in Windows 8.x/10 the defrag tool now deals with storage optimization and does a lot more than defragging such as sending TRIM hints to SSDs [2][3] so you definitely don&#x27;t want to disable that.<p>If you have cloned a Windows install from a HDD to an SSD you can force Windows to detect the drive as an SSD by running the following from an elevated Command Prompt (although WinSAT will run without any user input eventually):<p><pre><code>    winsat formal -restart clean
</code></pre>
One reason for disabling hibernation was because SSDs were small (< 64GB) and the hiberfil.sys in Windows would take up a non-trivial amount of disk space if you had a PC with 4GB-8GB RAM. These days it&#x27;s a non-issue since capacities are larger and the as The Tech Report have proven, it takes a lot of effort to wear out an SSD. Also, if you are using Windows 8.0 onwards disabling hibernation will also disable the fast startup feature.<p>Another very recent myth is that SSDs will lose data in as little as 7 days if left in a powered-off state [5]. Thankfully this has been thoroughly debunked [6].<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.anandtech.com/show/2738/17"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.anandtech.com/show/2738/17</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.anandtech.com/show/2614/7"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.anandtech.com/show/2614/7</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.hanselman.com/blog/TheRealAndCompleteStoryDoesWindowsDefragmentYourSSD.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hanselman.com/blog/TheRealAndCompleteStoryDoesWin...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.ghacks.net/2012/08/19/why-weekly-defrags-are-turned-on-for-ssds-under-windows-8/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ghacks.net/2012/08/19/why-weekly-defrags-are-turn...</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://www.extremetech.com/computing/205382-ssds-can-lose-data-in-as-little-as-7-days-without-power"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.extremetech.com/computing/205382-ssds-can-lose-da...</a><p>[6] <a href=""http://anandtech.com/show/9248/the-truth-about-ssd-data-retention"" rel=""nofollow"">http://anandtech.com/show/9248/the-truth-about-ssd-data-rete...</a>",1433070310

It&#x27;s not just data storage, but ways that Personally Identifying Information (PII) might be shared through a product, and whether that sharing is approved by a responsible adult, etc.<p>User generated content is almost always a candidate for PII leakage; for example in a block building game, you might reasonably expect a player to proudly build their full name in huge letters for all the world to see. If other players in game can see it, and a legal guardian hasn&#x27;t approved that kind of behaviour (and been unambiguously informed that their child can do that) then you&#x27;ve got a COPPA violation. And COPPA violations are routinely prosecuted, so you need to pay attention when making a product explicitly targeted at under 13s.

We used to frequently host couch surfers, but in the end we have made the most friends and had the best experience with airbnb priced to just cover the room rent.<p>We found it to greatly reduce conflicts between guests and hosts, and actually get people more engaged in our small community.<p>With couch surfing, I often had thoughts like &quot;I pay for your room and you can&#x27;t even put your dirty dishes away&quot;. Since we offered the room for free, we kind of expected some sort of autonomy from their side to help us out in the household or maybe cook some dinner for everyone if they stay longer than one night. They often expected that we would go explore the city with them and give them a lot of attention.<p>On airbnb that problem somehow mostly vanished. If things with the guest aren&#x27;t great, at least you get paid. Thus you also don&#x27;t need such a strict screening process anymore.
Due to this, there seems to be much more diversity regarding the types of people we get to meet.<p>Many of them actually just want a quiet room to sleep in, and it&#x27;s absolutely fine.
Some people however really get involved and become good friends. Especially when they stay longer (which almost never happens on couch surfing), the fact that they pay rent just like everyone else seems to make some of them much more open to suggest improvements and be proactive.<p>We&#x27;ve met a lot of diverse, interesting people through airbnb, some of which ended up staying for a long time, some coming back regularly. On couch surfing we&#x27;ve mostly met the traveling couple, group of friends coming here to party and young backpacker stereotypes.<p>What killed couch surfing for me personally though, was that no matter how many people I&#x27;ve hosted, I could never find anyone who would host me when I was traveling somewhere.

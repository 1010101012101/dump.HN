These sorts of things stopped being an issue for me.<p>Seriously folks, it's a red herring, an issue created to make sure that one party has something to fight the other party over. If you want to sack the rich, have at it. Just don't pretend that by taking that position you are doing anything at all for the national treasury. Or poor folks, for that matter.<p>In the larger picture, many technologists view the state as something of the past. Tens of thousands of people make their money simply because computers are hooked to each other over wires. It has very little to do with national budgets or policy (yes, you can throw out a bunch of silly nonsense about national broadband policies and such, but let's get real: this economic activity takes place in all sorts of various scenarios.)<p>So if you are the type to sit around pining away your day, thinking about all those super-rich folks and how good they have it, I'm sure this will be a fun article for you. If, however, you are concerned with public policy -- and the fact that in the US, at least, the majority of people do not even pay an income tax, yet vote on the rates for the rich minorities (gee, wonder how that will turn out?) then this is all so much posturing.<p>I don't feel a need to slam Buffett. He's a patriotic citizen who means well. Smarter guy than me in a lot of areas. I'm just not sure that this article has anywhere near enough merit to have 500+ points on HN. It offers no solutions, only rehashed populist tripe. If you want to set the income tax at 95% of all money made over a million bucks? Have at it. It's not important.",1313416418

This reduces the chance of collision (and associated blocking, thread switching, kernel trips) and moves the 'saturation point' (where there are so many threads that there's always somebody blocking) up in threadcount by an order of magnitude.<p>In my measurement, OS X and linux both simply implement ""critical section"" as a semaphore, with two full kernel trips to take and release the cs. Since the code being protected is usually less than 10 instructions, the ratio of overhead to code protected is 1,000 or so.  The saturation point can be a couple score threads.<p>In Windows (yes! Windows!) they use special opcodes that lock/unlock the bus to provide atomic update of in-memory variables. The ratio is about 1 or 2.

It's not a meaningful word to use, and you even know that. Contrast with 'progressive tax', which <i>is</i> well-defined.<p>I don't understand the line of thinking which effectively says ""people don't want to earn 2 if they have to pay 1 in tax"". Erm, you're still richer than you were if you didn't earn more. The only possible argument against this is if earning another 100k takes more amount of effort it took to earn your first 100k. But if you know anything about making money it doesn't work that way. With more capital comes greater opportunities. You can afford an accountant to manage your money, you have more investment options, and so forth; and you still have enough to spare for a comfortable lifestyle.<p>A flat tax implies that a dollar is worth just as much to Warren Buffett as it is to someone flipping burgers, which demonstrates a complete lack of perspective.<p>Put it this way: everyone's living expenses are, say, 12k. now if you're earning a median wage that leaves you 10k to invest how you like. If you're earning 50k you get to invest 38k. assuming the schemes offer the same rate of return, guess who is going to amass 50k first? Hint: it's not the guy who has to get a 5x return on his investment.<p>The higher rate income tax is an incentive to invest the money you receive back into the economy via business or charity, where it is taxed at a lower rate or even not at all, rather than spent on your own personal gain. Why should it scare you that the government would take that money? BTW, investment in financial instruments of dubious benefit is giving money to the financial system (this should really be obvious...) so it does contribute to the economy, but there are almost certainly better ways to do so.<p>The problem with the libertarian perspective is that it irrationally assumes the best of people when there is no incentive for them to do so. If a billionnaire can afford to fund all the services he requires that someone on the poverty line would depend on government for, why should the billionnaire give his money away? If you want a society you have an obligation to provide for one, if you believe it is unfair that someone with broader shoulders should carry more weight, then perhaps you should consider how fair it is that  he has broader shoulders and others do not.",1313415587

Those behaviors you describe are not analogous to the problems of bitcoin. Just <i>storing</i> money as bitcoin puts it at risk of permanent loss.  If you take out 100 credit cards and never check your balance you are <i>still</i> covered for every conceivable fraud scenario (and in many situations the bank will tell <i>you</i> that you&#x27;ve been a victim before you even realize it). With bitcoin you are never covered regardless of your vigilance or best practices. You can be an expert user and simply make a typo and send your money to the wrong address and then you&#x27;re screwed. The general public doesn&#x27;t have the time, patience, or technical skills to decide which OS is the most secure for storing money, especially when bitcoin itself doesn&#x27;t actually provide any novel benefits <i>for most people</i>.<p>> <i>It&#x27;s a trade off, sure, but when it comes to my money I rather trust myself to keep sane habits than trust the payment processing website, the bank AND the gov. not to screw me.</i><p>That&#x27;s your right and I&#x27;m glad bitcoin exists for you, but it&#x27;s simply wrong to suggest that bitcoin is <i>safer</i>, it&#x27;s not. If you trust yourself to keep your bitcoin secure, more power to you, but statistically speaking your money is <i>still</i> less safe as bitcoin than as a bank balance. It&#x27;s like saying that driving your motorcycle cross country is safer than flying because you trust yourself not to crash. I&#x27;m happy that you can be your own bank and I think that it&#x27;s cool as hell that this is possible because of an emergent econony based on open source software, but bitcoin is not practical, useful, and least of all safe for most people.",1446764057

Either you believe that no government is necessary, or you believe that government can operate without money, or you believe that government can create the money it needs to operate (with minimal negative effects), or you believe that government can raise sufficient money from something other than taxes.  (But if they raise money from anything other than voluntary contributions, it&#x27;s pretty much a tax.  I would consider tariffs to be taxes, for example - they&#x27;re just a tax on foreign trade rather than income or property.)<p>From what I recall of your posts, I think you take the first position - that no government is necessary.  I strongly disagree, but here I will limit myself to saying that there is no evidence of this being possible.

One is providing capital to companies. Selling shares is a way to do that. But not many people would buy shares because growing companies is risky and slow business.

If you expecting to gain a well rounded education, where you learn about many things that you otherwise wouldn&#x27;t have, then relying only on you&#x27;re intellectual curiosity will not work for most people I&#x27;ve met.  Yes, for the rare auto-didact, they will dive deep on their own time into many different subjects, but in my experience most people I&#x27;ve known (even liberal arts majors) would never look beyond the confines of their chosen area of study.<p>I can&#x27;t remember how many times in high school and college I heard classmates grumble about  &quot;after I graduate, when will I ever need this&quot;.  In high school (for me) it was mostly aimed at math classes (I grew up in a very blue collar area where the high school had something like 10% of their students going on the college).  They were happier learning history or having to read cliff notes on some novel.<p>But in college it was usually people in one major complaining that they had to take the &quot;wider world&quot; requirements.  Though actually I heard it the absolute most from fellow music majors that had to take a physics class on acoustics.<p>The reality is so many people see college solely as job prep, and that is a very strong part of what it can do, but (and this is kind of the point of the article) it can function in many other ways.  I&#x27;m a counter example.  I&#x27;ve spent something like 15 years in college.  I have two bachelors (philosophy and english), an MFA (creative writing) and and working towards a PhD (math).

And about that rate has been sustained for decades, as well. Can you imagine hundreds of thousands of books being published every year for decades? Who&#x27;s writing them? How is this economicly sustainable? (If it&#x27;s not, do we <i>really</i> need to incentivize publication with ever longer copyright?) This is why when Google Books tried to estimate how many books had ever been published, they got a lower bound of 129 million and no real idea how much off they might be.<p>And it&#x27;s not just books, either. There&#x27;s maybe 100,000 albums being released every year, which means in our lifetime we&#x27;ll hit 1 billion+. The number of feature films keeps going up (4000 a year not terribly long ago). The TV industry is feeling shellshocked by just how many programs are in production now. And all these numbers seem like they must be undercounts because who is really able to track how many new songs get uploaded to Youtube every day by professionals, amateurs, and all sorts of indescribable people? And in the rest of the world like China?",1446762302
10516570,comment,10505476,10516162,0,0,detrino,,,"> Compared to Rust? I doubt that. Like I said, Rust lets you dance near the line.<p>Your problem is that you are trying to imagine what happens in the real world rather than just looking at it.<p>> This is from experience in various large C++ codebases. I&#x27;m not saying people use refcounting a lot, I&#x27;m saying it gets used more than Rust.<p>I count 56 <i>imports</i> of Arc and 37 of Rc in servo, would you wager the equivalent parts of chromium or firefox use more ref-counting?<p>> Not really. Aside from non-lexical borrows and a couple other nice-to-have things (but not necessary), the borrow checker is pretty precise for what it tries to prove.<p>The problem is that the borrow checker does not look at the function as a whole. You are a slave to the borrow checker, you can only consider other things when it has been satisfied, even if its trivially safe from a whole-function view. Some simple things aren&#x27;t even expressible at all without non-lexical borrows, no matter what gymnastics you try.<p>> It sort of does. If you try to introduce borrows and listen to the suggestions the compiler gives you, and eventually end up nowhere, it&#x27;s probably not possible to do it that way.<p>That sounds like a terrible workflow that I don&#x27;t think Rust programmers use in the real world. I think they usually use shared ownership because they know they have shared ownership, not because they gave up on the borrow checker. Any instance of actually resorting to reference counting because of the inability to make the borrow checker happy actually counts <i>against</i> Rust, not for it.<p>> in practice IMO the things Rust makes you feel safe to do is a superset of what C++ lets you feel safe to do<p>People <i>routinely</i> do safe things in C++ that would be impossible to express in safe Rust code. You need to let go if this untruth.<p>> if we&#x27;re going to talk about &quot;all possible things C++ theoretically allows you to do&quot;, then you should include unsafe -- you were comparing &quot;safe Rust&quot; with &quot;all C++&quot;, which is unfair here, since the entities to be compared for what you&#x27;re theoretically allowed to do are &quot;all Rust&quot; and &quot;all C++&quot;.<p>I focused on safe Rust because <i>your</i> argument was that safe Rust is just as powerful as C++, just proved safe statically. This is far from the truth and you refuse to accept the correction. Most people in the Rust community would probably say they accept the loss in power because they prefer absolute safety. This is a very defensive position. It&#x27;s impressive just how little power Rust gives up in comparison to languages like C#/Java. But to pretend that you actually have more power in Rust due to psychological effects is just zealotry and doesn&#x27;t reflect how people use C++ in the real world.<p>> Examples?<p>Any abstraction that uses dynamic checking that would be considered a bug to actually trigger. Some examples include borrowing a RefCell, random access of iterators, sequential access of certain kinds of iterator adaptors, etc.",1446762294

In the end, if not allowed to form a cartel, all publishers will reach a stable-ish price (differing only for different qualities of each edition, e.g. paper quality, hardcover, etc).<p>Else, it&#x27;s like we limit a reproductible work in an artificial way as if it was an one-off item, by granting sole pricing rights AND absolute control of its sales to the author.",1446762293

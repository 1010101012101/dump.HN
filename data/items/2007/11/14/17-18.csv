I was going to get into details, but figured my requirements are so typical it wouldn't be worth the extra description.<p>This is for a standard LAMP-based app with a minimum of graphics. I expect traffic volume to be low for the near future and have no heavy-duty requirements for video and such.<p>Basically I'd like to find an economical service that can scale with my user base.",1195062815

That is good protection.<p>I didnt realize there was a TCP standard for the max acceptable amount of retransmissions. But yeah if you can account for this with a pad then you should always be safe.<p>If you ever opensource your network code I'd love to see it.",1195062784

Of course not.<p>I was referring to performance and ease of adapting the JVM's way of doing things internally to very different languages. This is quoting a number of parrot and jython developers. I have the links around here somewhere..<p>Why do you think jython et all are so terribly far behind? It's not for shortage of interest, more because the likely possible outcome of this could only be sub-par.",1195062253

At the end of one of our meetings, the investor was checking his emails and pulled-up the Songkick powerpoint via an angel network they'd signed-up to! Then the following week you guys hit TechCrunch! That was pretty exciting and inspirational for me! <p>I'm eager to meet some fellow founders & hackers - so I've got to make OCC London and these hacker meetups...<p>",1195061207

79771,comment,78933,79358,0,0,breck,,,"I think if you are doing something you are passionate about self-discipline will arise naturally. You'll want to be better at what you are doing and so you start waking earlier, focusing more, turning down potential distractions, etc. Maybe most importantly you start meeting successful people in your fields and start to replicate their more productive habits.",1195060627

79769,comment,79694,79700,0,0,akkartik,,,"Hmm, but wouldn't it be annoying if it loads stuff on top while you're reading/clicking something? You'd lose your place on the page. I suppose I could create gmail-style update messages you have to click on. That loses the medusa-head character, though :)<p>I'm using page load as a surrogate for 'mark all as read', which keeps track of the state of the divider and so on. Keeps the UI simple.<p>follow is intended to be something you periodically focus on. With auto-reload stuff flows past you so fast I'm not sure what the dashboard-like view would convey above the fold. Especially since even new stuff vanishes below the fold on many occasions. Making something you can just glance at is much harder, I think.",1195060164

The only difference then was that the Sopranos was only in it's first season so it was not yet considered cool to do a photo shoot in which you posed as an organized crime figure. <p>GIVE ME A BREAK.<p>Articles like this make me think that the latest tech boom is already over.  This is just a trailing indicator.<p>",1195059821

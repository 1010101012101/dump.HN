Or dynamism that rivals Ruby and Python if you don't bother to specify types.  An object system (and meta-object protocol) that rivals Smalltalk in sophistication.  Full functional programming capabilities, and a syntax and libraries that favor that style.  An entire sub-language for iteration that rivals Python's generation/comprehension facilities.  The ability to be procedural when you really need to.  Sophisticated built in data types.  A facility for abstraction unrivaled by any other language that's not a Lisp.<p>The point is not necessarily that CL is the absolute best for every one of those points.

It seems the only way to maintain a non-niche forum is to aggressively counteract unthinking contributions (""me too"" posts, Internet memes) and trolls. Having a sanctioned area to vent and flame in, to keep the main area focused on serious (or at least on-topic) discussion may also help.

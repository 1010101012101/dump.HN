Our employees contribute a large chunk of the changes to Wine.<p>Obviously this port was botched, and the article is right to be annoyed at such a low effort port. I&#x27;m here to say that it is a really hard problem, even for experienced porters like ourselves. Proprietary software, especially games, on an open source operating system is hard. You&#x27;ve got libraries changing underneath you in incompatible ways, so you&#x27;ve got to support both versions of the library, or even ship your own build of the library. You&#x27;ve got any number of different desktop environments, which makes integration with the native environment hard. You&#x27;ve got about the same number of different window managers, each of which handles window messaging, stacking, etc in different ways. Each operating system, and often even each operating system version, has different package names, making dependency resolution a special hell.<p>Shipping proprietary software on Linux is a Hard Problem. You can target specific distros, but you&#x27;ll still have unhappy users who (rightly) want their distro supported. It&#x27;s a very long tail.<p>This port was botched, but I bet they&#x27;re trying to get in on the SteamOS wave. It&#x27;s hard to blame them for wanting some nominal support for Linux, and thus SteamOS, but they clearly chose the wrong contractor to provide the service.<p>All that said, I do have one issue with this article:<p>> They did not communicate the fact that it was not a proper native version, but simply a wrapped Windows version. It was fully advertised as “now available for SteamOS”, giving the false impression it was recompiled for it. Not a very good idea to hide stuff like that.<p>We get this complaint a lot. When your application is built using DirectX and other Windows APIs, doing a native port to another platform&#x27;s API can be very expensive. It&#x27;s not as easy as switching the Linux switch and running make.<p>Properly done ports are nearly indistinguishable from a game built natively on Unix APIs. In a kind of perverse way, you can actually get better forwards compatibility with a non-native port like this. As the old binaries rot and fall out of compatibility with modern desktops, you can just pull out the Windows executables and run them in a modern version of Wine.<p>Think of Wine (or this Eon thing, if it were done properly) not as a wrapper, but as a library that the authors decided to target their application for. You can then upgrade your library and still run the application that targeted it.",1401799701

7839684,comment,7839154,7839154,2,0,enewe101,,,"Lately I&#x27;ve been really focused on catering to the main usecase of most websites: reading.  Not all websites are for reading, of course!, but if yours is, use a nice big font with serifs, like 18 or 20px computer modern, and keep the number of characters per line down around 65.  This makes the trip your eyes take during a &quot;visual carriage return&quot; shorter, so you keep your place more easily.<p>I like to use sans for any widgets.  Serifs are nice for the main content, because they signal an editorial frame, but for you don&#x27;t want that for your widgets.  I also like to keep the text on widgets a bit smaller, because they spend too much time sitting there, staring at you, not telling you anything useful.<p>I also like to keep pages single-purpose.  On any given horizontal line, have only focus.  This will obviously depend on your application.  But chances are pretty good that your website is meant to be read, and most people can only read one string at a time.  Put related stuff at the bottom, or top.  Ok, maybe a nav bar in the margin -- but it should be quieter than the main content.<p>The layout and styling of a website should emphasize the main content, and help make relationships between items of content clear.  That said, design should be subtle.  It should not speak, or else it will compete for the user&#x27;s attention with content.  Keep a high information-to-ink ratio.  Meaningless gloss, is to be avoided.  The beginning or ending of an article is important, mark it a big initial, an elegant flourish, or a nice, stolid tombstone.  But please don&#x27;t succumb to the temptation to put drop shadows, gradients, and other bubbly 3D effects.<p>Usually, what makes a website nice is what is <i>not</i> done.<p>Also, hold your color.  Black, white, 80% grey, and 20% grey are your best friends.  IMO they are good for about 95% of the pixels on the page.  In that context, color can then actually be used to signal meaning, emphasis, and functionality.  Lots of sites establish a highlight, background, and main-text color which are not in the greyscale.  That&#x27;s ok as long as that&#x27;s as far as it goes.<p>This should go without saying, but don&#x27;t use any animation anywhere, ever.  Ok, ok, I&#x27;m excluding single-frame changes on mouseclick and hover -- used judiciously.  But please, no stretching menus, whirling tabs, and no slide shows.  If I want to watch a goddamn slideshow, I&#x27;d go watch a doggamned slideshow :P<p>Again, this assumes you&#x27;re making a site for reading.

7839653,comment,7838459,7838459,1,0,crazy1van,,,"So what is the optimal work day for productivity? Many folks here believe it&#x27;s a (proven?) fact that less than 40 is actually more productive. However, surely 40 is more productive than 0. So, what is the magic number?<p>Personally, I don&#x27;t think this is that simple. Heck, humans just aren&#x27;t that simple. I think some people and some professions are more productive above 40 and others are more productive under 40. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m in favor of a system that leaves this as a point of negotiation between the employee and employer. Just like there is no one-size fits all salary for, say, a java developer with 5 years experience (how fast is he? how buggy is his code? can he work independently? etc), why would expect to find a one size fits all for work day length?",1401798233

Mortgage debt is included in the US calculation anyway, so what&#x27;s the point exactly? The US doesn&#x27;t get a special calculation for household debt that is different from the Netherlands.

Let&#x27;s compare the Netherlands to the rest of Europe who they are in theory most similar to: their individual debt is drastically higher than basically all of Europe.<p>Third, having eg 100% of your home consumed by debt, means you do not own equity in your home.

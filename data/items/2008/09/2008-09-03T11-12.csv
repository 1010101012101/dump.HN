293726,comment,293320,293425,0,0,catch23,,,"It's unlikely that adblock will make a dent in google's advertising revenues.  A good chunk of their revenues comes from ppc (search advertising).  As long as people use google as their search engine, google will always have their main source of revenue.<p>""Banner Ads"" will die, but that's probably a good thing.  There have been other forms of advertising that have taken ground already.  If you use facebook and you look at the ""feed"" you'll know what I mean.  Good advertisers will know how to promote their products without users even realizing they are being subject to 3rd party goods/brand promotion.",1220442475

That's a good point.<p>Plus, since you never give a password, you don't have to worry about how they're storing it.  Plain text in the database?  passwords.txt file in the webroot?  Doesn't matter because they don't have it.",1220441576

293717,comment,292351,292351,0,0,MicahWedemeyer,,,"My site uses OpenID, and I'm surprised at how many users actually do understand it.<p>It's especially true in the case of Yahoo users.  All they have to do is type in ""yahoo.com"" and they're in.  Try and explain to me how it's easier to remember a bunch of usernames and passwords than ""yahoo.com""<p>And remember: There are no overarching guidelines on usernames and passwords, so the whole ""use the same one every time"" almost works...but not quite.  One site requires a 6-letter password, another requires 9 with one uppercase letter and a number, while another has no requirements whatsoever.  That crap gets frustrating as hell for me and there are several sites that I have to re-request my password every freaking time I go.<p>As more and more big sites come on as providers, like MySpace and Yahoo, it will only get better.  I agree that there are issues with presenting and explaining it to users, but the underlying premise is a good one.",1220441373

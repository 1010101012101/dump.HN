I'm sick of the herd mentality, and you guys can vote me into the gutter and it's not going to stop me.<p>I could care less about Krugman.",1224064665

Support when you are starting is apreciated :)<p>Sometimes you need someone to look upon, who you can use as inspiration or for support. The closer they are to you the better you tend to feel. For example, I would look first for a local incubator (Spain) instead of aiming for a foreign one (e.g. US), but that doesn't mean the foreign ones aren't as good, just that I probably will feel more comfy on the one that's closer and consider we will understand each other better. This of course can be true or not, and I will find out eventually.<p>Before thinking about ""does genre matter"", think of the subject and change genre for something else. Does it sound normal to you? Then why the controversy when it's about genre (or race, politics or whatever)? This is just a proposition to try to bring more players into the game :)",1224064534

Google used to be the hub of innovation but this browser is a disappointment. The minimalistic address bar is a very poor clone of Firefox's wonderbar and the default homepage is an exact copy of Opera's hot dial, also the javascript console is a copy of safari's.

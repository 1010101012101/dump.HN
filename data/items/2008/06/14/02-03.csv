It's basically the old Concord bookstore, re-opened in Cambridge after some dispute with the owner, after which all the employees quit en masse.<p>Rodney's bookstore on Mass Ave in Central Square is at least somewhat dusty.<p>The lower floor of the Harvard Bookstore is all used books, though mostly remainders, not much dust.<p>If you're into sci-fi/fantasy: <a href=""http://www.pandemoniumbooks.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pandemoniumbooks.com/</a><p>The Coop is pretty weak in my opinion. It's owned by Barnes and Noble, and the selection is not remarkable.<p>Also, tomorrow, there's the river festival: <a href=""http://www.cambridgeartscouncil.org/riverfestival/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cambridgeartscouncil.org/riverfestival/</a><p>Sponsored by Microsoft, no less!",1213412305

I think I'm more a fan of the dusty, hole-in-a-wall, hidden gem sort of place.<p>I'll look into that community boat house - I'm not sure if I have the time or patience, but it is definitely worth considering. Do you know where I can read more about it, or what the name is?",1213412119
217319,comment,217274,217274,0,0,cowmoo,,,"Sorry to hijack the thread - but I think that this is pretty appropriate nonetheless. I just recently moved to Cambridge/Boston, MA as well. Would someone enlighten me, as to what might be some great software/web companies in the area that a young CS grad should consider and apply to? I feel a little bit lost here, as there are certainly lots of tech companies in Boston but I only saw a few walking in downtown and Kendall Square.",1213411818

If I can manage to get a working proof-of-concept before I graduate I'll likely pursue it full time.<p>Otherwise, I still have a lot to learn (as I discovered from my last boss) and a few years at a big company (ITA Software looks promising) may do me some good.",1213411814

Thanks, I'll probably check it out this weekend.<p>Although, I already have a queue of about 10 books to get to ... A visit there will likely just make me feel more guilty for not reading enough ;-)",1213411611

There is a lack of innovation, creativity and challenges in my current job. I want to do something innovative, meaningful and challenging.\nSo, I am working to start a web startup.

I think you can take it as you want to.<p>By using the word ""sequel"" in the title, I was implying that there is perhaps some hope for future CS students to be inspired by the beauty that was in the SICP class and book.

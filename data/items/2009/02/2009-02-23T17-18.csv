491836,comment,491515,491696,0,0,Xichekolas,,,"My (admittedly anecdotal) evidence is to the contrary. Enterprise applications are neither the fastest nor the cheapest solution (at least not as implemented in any of the ""Enterprise"" places I have worked).<p>I think generally the problem is twofold. First, as the GP pointed out, design decisions (both technical and aesthetic) are made by people who aren't programmers or end users. These people care more about documentation and 'The Plan' than solving the problem elegantly.<p>The second problem is that most 'technical' people doing in-house enterprise apps aren't that great. I know this sounds callous of me, and there are definitely still great people here and there, but the average ability level is pretty low. My 'enterprise architect' has never even used Java 5 (her excuse: she hasn't had any training for it yet). People like this aren't going to be confident enough to suggest (or even aware of) alternative implementations to those given them by the 'design committee'.<p>I just started a job doing 'Enterprise Java' (gotta pay the bills until grad school this fall) and they have me working on this project for the next 6-7 months. Once I finally parsed all the buzzword bingo documentation, I realized that what I'm implementing is basically a read-only ORM.<p>The design as I'm given requires 15+ lines of Java to get a single object back (you know, Post.find(:title => 'foo')) and requires the end user to know which table goes with which DAO goes with which business object, among other things. I'm slowly but surely getting changes approved by my 'architect', and hopefully will, in the end, have something a little more sane.<p>The fact that they are paying both me and her for six months worth of work to do something that really could be handled by an existing ORM definitely doesn't point to in-house 'Enterprise software' being the cheapest solution. Throw in some of the ridiculous design decisions and 'requirements of our company's standard architecture', and it's not really the fastest either.<p>As for the Enterprise software from vendors, I'd argue that the problem is that it's solving the problems of these in-house developers and managers, who only have the problems due to over-complexifying (not a word I know) what they do.",1235409571

[1] Average vehicle sales price is $25,000 [2], despite the existence of nice cheap fuel-efficient cars like the Yaris at $12,000.<p>Actually, the numbers don't say that.<p>If you only have one car, that car has to satisfy almost all of your car needs.  The Yaris doesn't for a lot of people.  (The Scion xB does for a lot more people.)<p>If you're going to buy an ""extra"" car for its mileage, it has to be cost less than the amount of money that you save by using it instead of your ""all uses"" car.  A $12k extra car usually doesn't do that.<p>A 10mpg vehicle will use 10k gallons over 100k.  A 15mpg vehicle uses 6.6k gallons.  A 20mpg vehicle uses 5k gallons, 30mpg uses 3.3k, a 40mpg vehicle uses 2.5k, and a 50mpg vehicle uses 2k gallons.<p>At $4/g, the 10mpg vehicle's gas costs $40k, the 15mpg vehicle's gas costs $26.6k, the 20mpg vehicle's gas costs $20k, 30mpg costs $13k, the 40mpg vehicle's gas costs $10k, and the 50mpg vehicle's gas costs $8k.<p>Note that gas isn't the only cost - the ""gas saver"" extra car also has license/registration, insurance, maintenance, time value of money (the gas cost is over time while the purchase cost either isn't, or requires paying interest), etc.<p>So, if you're already getting 15mpg, the gas savings from an extra vehicle that gets 40mpg are considerably less than $12k.<p>If you're already getting 20mpg, it's even harder to save money by buying an extra vehicle.<p>In other words, the guy who wanted a $4k gas saver may have been at the upper end of economic sense - the ""extra car to save gas"" probably needs to be less than $3k.<p>Yes, the ability to ""rent"" big vehicles for occasional usage can let people have smaller ""main"" cars, but only if the rental cost is sufficiently low.  I note that the zip car people seem to have gone the other direction.  Hertz and the like charge a significant premium for big vehicles.<p>And the loss of flexibility is important.  I can (and have) gone diving with 15 minutes notice.  If I had to rent a car....<p>And, yes, many families have multiple vehicles.  They still have to satisfy simultaneous users so the above analysis applies.  (Yes, many can, and do, make do with a ""big"" and ""medium"", but that means that a 3rd vehicle to save gas must cost even less than the above suggests because they're already using the big vehicle less than their average.)",1235409116

When you're working on a thesis, you're still within some academic community, have a rough deadline, and have a pretty good sense of what's going to fly or not. Moreover, the progress you make on a thesis is inherently satisfying. You can stand back and look at even a page or a paragraph of work with pride.<p>When you're working on a startup, you spend much of your time working on things that don't work yet or will look and feel like crap for a while. A lot of the problems you solve aren't going to be intellectually interesting, as they would be for a thesis.

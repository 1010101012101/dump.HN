Copyright protection and trade secret protection are available for software, while patent protection is available for ""business methods.""<p>The whole issue is that one wouldn't reasonably believe that checking someone's driver's license to verify that it matches the name on the credit card they used to purchase goods at an auction qualifies as patentable subject matter. Yet, in 1999, eBay received a patent for a ""Method and apparatus for verifying the identity of a participant within an on-line auction environment."" [Pat. No. 6,466,917]<p>As we move more and more brick and mortar business functions to the virtual world, people are able to get around the prior art by inextricably linking their business method with a device--a computer or, as patent attorneys eloquently say:<p>""a client computer to present user interface information specifying an identity verification interface for obtaining personal information of a user and to communicate personal information over a communications network; a transaction computer, coupled to the client computer via a communications network, to implement a transaction system that facilitates transactions between the user and a further user, to receive the personal information from the client computer via the communications network, and to communicate the personal information over the communications network; and an identity verification computer, coupled to the transaction computer via the communications network, to receive the personal information from the transaction computer via the communications network, to perform an identity verification process to generate a verification result, and to communicate the verification result to the transaction computer over the communications network, wherein transaction computer makes the verification result available to the further user via the communications network and responsive to a request from the further user for information concerning the user."" [Pat. No. 6,466,917]<p>I find it intractable for one to reasonably believe that the virtual environment is so extraordinarily different from real life so as to justify awarding patents for routine business methods. The problem with business method patents, quite bluntly, is that the Supreme Court absolutely <i>blew it</i> in Bilski by not articulating, precisely, how much of a transformation is necessary to consider it ""inventive.""<p>This is for Congress to decide.",1320648311

3205276,comment,3204238,3205050,3,0,rayiner,,,"So first of all, the concept of ""double taxation"" is something you have to be careful with. In general, a given dollar will be taxed more than once because it is spent more than once. However, that same dollar also counts towards the net income of the country more than once. Double taxation is when the same income is taxed more than once, which is a bit different.<p>Capital gains in general does not involve double taxation. Some examples:<p>If you buy property for $100,000, and sell it for $150,000, you'll pay capital gains taxes on the $50,000. Here, $200,000 of income is involved and $200,000 is taxed.<p>Say you invest $100k in a store, and build it up to $100k/year in revenue. You sell it for $1m. The business has no assets to speak of (you lease the space, etc). You're taxed on the $900k. Here $1.9m of income is involved and $1.9m of income is taxed.<p>Where you do run into double taxation is with corporations. $1m of corporate income is taxed once when it is earned and again when it is distributed as a dividend. But that's because the corporate income tax is double taxation, not because capital gains is double taxation.<p>Also, there is no double taxation when paying salaries. Say you have $1m in revenue and $400k in expenses (salaries and rent). You're taxed on the $600k of net income, not the $1m in total revenue.",1320647675

3205271,comment,3204238,3205050,0,0,meric,,,"Same with dividends for non-Australian countries.<p>But let's look at how incentives change when these ""double taxes"" were removed:<p>1. No capital gain tax: Encourages speculation because speculation is ""tax-free"". Prices across commodities, properties, stocks and bonds will all rise, and may result in even more speculation.<p>2. No dividend tax: Encourages investment into companies who pay out high dividends because dividends are no longer taxed as much. Buying goods for the sake of capital gain would become less advantageous than buying goods because it pays out passive income that is tax free.<p>3. No corporate tax: Companies no longer store their money overseas as repatriating money from overseas no longer costs any taxes. Encourages investment by companies rather than hiring more workers, paying more wages, or paying out taxes, because further profit from investment is not taxed, but the other three activities are. Encourage creation of more companies (at least on paper).<p>4. No employee tax: Companies will be able to get more employee per dollar, and encourages companies to hire more employees because they can pay $100000 and the employee will now get $100000 instead of $60000. There will also be the effect of wage inflation; Every company wants to hire more employees.<p>Of all the double taxation that exists I advocate getting rid of (2) first.",1320647620

My learning process almost mimicked the old time when people used to program on punch cards and running routines during small amount of time. \nI started to work as a packer on a local grocery store to earn money and buy my first computer, and I did it piece by piece, first I got this mother board, memory, processor and a shitty power supply that almost cost me six months of salary when it burned during a lightstorm. I didnt have enough money to buy a hard drive so I started to load things up on floppy disks with DOS and Pascal. I wrote almost all software that I needed using Pascal. Writing computer software become my main life objective and I was pretty happy with that.<p>On day on my job at grocery store I was able to fix a tax bug in a Delphi project and got my first promotion. I was 16 my manager started to fill my head with information, he was the regular IBM/Norton guy and pushed me into the University. Once I started taking classes at college I quit from work and started to push really hard to become a great computer scientist. I was pretty good on calculus and physics and also was doing great on other classes. My dad was affording my college but one year before my graduation things become difficult at home, in the end we had no money or food and I decided to quit university and get a job to afford my family.<p>I move out form my hometown to live on one of the biggest cities in the world, and actually I did really great on CS even without a degree. I travelled across south america working with different peoples and projects and was earning money to support my family. I started with open source software around 06 and even got a full time job at RedHat to work on this open source project. I spent about 2 years working full time from home, but I decide to quit to chase a whole new level on my career.<p>I had this passion for computer science and I started to work doing Machine Learning algorithms at my job trying to solve particular problems. Actually I never quit studying, I aways read books about advanced topics on CS, learned Lisp, improved my english ( sorry Im not a native speaker =) ) and did other things like playing piano and guitars.<p>Right now I have this great job working with great people, doing great products but I still miss something, I completely missed one of my lifes main objective that is earn a degree. I have this crush for academics and I thing I could be a more valuable teacher than software engineer. Recently I started to hire younglings and teach then how to become great developers.<p>Next year Im going to enroll on an  University and start pursue my diploma on CS, then a master's degree and maybe a PhD on machine learning. Such objective requires some sacrifice and I will probably quit my job and start doing part time programming contracts.<p>Im 28 lead software engineer with strong background on large scale systems (my current projects delivery almost 3.2 billions requests by month).<p>I have some infrastructure background using EC2, Rackspace, Chef (I eat my own dod food) I know what happens with a large scale ruby project during a slashdot effect and how to prevent complete failure.<p>I also worked implementing delivering a web semantic capable CMS with a bunch of knowledge extractors and classifiers to increment news relationship and conversion.<p>I can work professionally with Java, Ruby, Python and even C. (I know R and Octave but not proficient)<p>I can speak English, Spanish and Portuguese.<p>I have this B1/B2 visa that allows me travel to US to meet with the team.<p>So I ask, is there anyone who can offer me a long term part time job to help me afford my degree? This  is a lifetime opportunity to have a great software engineer who can help you boost your company =)<p>Ps: Im using this trow away account so leave your contacts or website then I can send you my linkedin using my real name, Sorry for this inconvenience, but I dont like people sneaking into my private life.<p>edited: some typos.",1320646955

The first few times they encounter problems, they assume it's their fault and go RTFM, ask for help, and exercise their support contract if they're lucky enough to have one. Eventually it dawns on them that they shouldn't have to be jumping through these hoops, and that somewhere along the way they have been misled.<p>So it's not like anyone is misinterpreting the purpose and/or problem domain of MongoDB.

It fits what I'm trying to build, and it doesn't seem to have many obvious drawbacks. I think I'll give that a try.""

C doesn't <i>have</i> any of these.<p>Sure, it takes a while for you to wrap your head around pointers. But it also takes a while for you to wrap your head around inheritance. By virtue of being a smaller language, C has less of these things to wrap your head around.<p>If you need a dynamic array, you have to build it yourself from what you already know. Instead of having to learn yet another opaque concept, you're <i>reinforcing</i> your knowledge of pointers and dynamic memory allocation.

When you compare serfdom to pretty much any alternative is better. You will also notice if you read the data correctly that individual wealth has risen across the board. Everyone has more than they would have otherwise had in the 1950s. That's great but it doesn't mean that economic discussion is now over because all arguments have been won and lost.<p>What I was wondering about in my post was what happens when capital no longer requires much labour. This is happening now, hedgefunds are a great examples of this. They are amazingly efficient and produce very large sums of capital for the amount of labour required (revenue per employee). I'm not saying all labour is equal, I am saying capital is producing more in industries with less labour. Potentially, a financial model could get so good (or so stable) that it requires only minor updates to the system in order continue deriving a profit. You then have a situation where capital creates capital with only a statistically insignificant amount of labour. Efficiency pushes the system forward and delivers much to people while people have a valuable product to sell, their labour. When their labour is not valuable, they are unemployed. If their labour cannot generate enough value, why would they ever be employed in an ultimately efficient system?<p>My argument still stands, if you would like to respond to it.

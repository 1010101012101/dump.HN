1361932,comment,1361163,1361498,0,0,ccc3,,,"-<i>Exactly. How do you have one without the other?</i><p>If obvious patents are granted, society will be giving it's protection at a net loss. For society there is a cost incurred in enforcing protection as well as an opportunity cost in forbidding competition (assuming you believe competition creates better products). This trade-off could be worth it, but only if if the invention would not have emerged, or would have taken a long time to emerge, without protection.<p>-<i>Should Microsoft (or any other patent holder) go to court and argue on the basis that society is not being well served?</i><p>Absolutely not. They should never have to argue for anyone but themselves in court. Microsoft is just playing the patent game by the rules that exist today. My problem is with a system that is neglecting its purpose. The problem seems to be rooted in patent rules that are massively out of touch with the current state (and pace) of technology.<p>-<i>Any article that simply refers to a patent abstract as proof of the triviality of a patent is itself trolling. Patent abstracts offer a very broad description; it is the detailed body of the patent that distinguishes it.</i><p>You're absolutely right in saying that it's not fair to criticize a patent simply by its abstract. The problem is that often the detailed description in the body of the patent is far too broad. Many patents have less to do with a specific invention and more to do with gaining blanket coverage of a large swath of IP. This is the game that large companies and their patent lawyers are playing. I would argue that a system where ""he who has the most lawyers wins"" is very counterproductive to invention and innovation.",1274295270

We weren't checking our feed readers; someone texted me the news.<p>All the same - you're right, the traffic was low. A lot of people had thought ""we'd made it"" from being ""Mashed"", but clearly, that was anything but the truth. Still, I'll take it.<p>If you're curious, the post was here: <a href=""http://mashable.com/2009/11/27/guestlist/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mashable.com/2009/11/27/guestlist/</a>",1274292608

Android is getting more popular, and if Google releases a tablet that plays WebM youtube videos, I don't see why Apple wouldn't try to support it as well.",1274292587
1361794,comment,1360564,1361166,0,0,Tamerlin,,,"The author also conveniently ignored the fact that a lot of those applications exploded on the PC market partly because the PC's were so much more advanced.<p>Apple didn't lose all those developers because of freedom, those developers were after customers, and it's hard to convince customers to buy your product when you tie them to the high-priced and technologically backward option.<p>The reality is that Apple fears competition. It's never been able to handle any competition. When NuTech cloned the mac, Apple sued them into oblivion. When Apple start the clone program, the clones sold better machines... so Apple killed the program. When Apple bought eMagic and Nothing Real, it killed off the Windows version of both, because no one in their right mind would choose Apple's platform for such compute-intensive applications when it was so technologically behind the rest of the industry (except Sun, who was even farther behind).<p>So when buying a mac meant buying a vastly inferior machine, Apple lost a LOT of customers (including most of the high end film and visual FX industry, who went Linux + x86), largely because of the inferiority of the platform.<p>Today, the mac isn't an inferior platform, it's an identical platform. (I'm talking under the hood, not the ergonomics and OS.)<p>If Apple were smart, they'd be emphasizing their platform, and encouraging developers by doing the exact opposite of what they're doing. By continuing to support .NET, Apple would be making it easier for developers to make the transition to the iPhone and iPad. Sure, they'd get lots of generic apps, but they already have a huge pile of crud with a few gems here and there, and the better .NET developers who want their apps to success will put in the effort to make their apps iPad/iPhone/OSX compliant in order to better serve their users.",1274292573

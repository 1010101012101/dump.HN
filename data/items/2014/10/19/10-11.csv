8477914,comment,8477659,8477659,0,0,pmontra,,,"I&#x27;m a devop, not a system administrator. I setup and administered a number of single machine web services for my customers along the years, almost all of them with Debian plus some Ubuntus recently. Database, application server, web server. Nothing fancy. I also use Ubuntu as my primary desktop (some sort of gnome fallback DE) after I removed a lot of cruft if comes with by default.<p>From my experience what I need on a desktop is very different from what I need on a server. On a server I don&#x27;t care about displays, keyboards, backlighting, sound, USB disks, mics, scanners etc. On my desktop they are very important. There are a number of companies offering Linux VPSes with 512 MB RAM and they can be good to host a low traffic web service. Good luck running a modern Linux DE on a 512 MB machine. Not impossibile but not very productive.<p>So I can imagine having very different init systems for desktops and servers if this means that the server won&#x27;t be encumbered by a number subsystems which are of no use to it. Furthermore binaries instead of scripts and opaque log files leave a bad taste in my mouth. They make me figure a future with a Windows like event viewer to browse the log files, over a terminal based ssh connection. I&#x27;m quite concerned about it. It will waive one of the biggest advantages of a Linux server over a Windows one.<p>A fork, or an alternative init system, could be a good solution. We should run this experiment, pick what we like and don&#x27;t harass the people on the other side. We will see the results after some years. The satisfaction of the admins will decree the winner.",1413716288
8477913,comment,8477659,8477862,0,0,yaantc,,,"You can still use a keyscript (I do), it just need to be done in a different way. Instead of putting the configuration in /etc/crypttab, which confuses systemd indeed, you can still use the kernel cryptopts variable. For example, in the grub configuration add something like:<p>cryptopts=source=/dev/<disk>,target=sdc5_crypt,keyscript=/lib/cryptsetup/scripts/passdev,key=/dev/<other_disk>:/somdir/root.key<p>Anf then in /etc/fstab use the /dev/mapper/<target> (sdc5_crypt in the example above) as the root device, as before.<p>Then you need to make sure the initramfs contains all the tools needed to support this (that was done automatically with /etc/crypttab, it&#x27;s &quot;manual&quot; with the kernel option). To do this, add under /etc/initramfs-tools/hooks a script file to load what&#x27;s needed in the initramfs: cryptsetup, passdev, the needed kernel module. You can roughly copy the existing /usr/share/initramfs-tools/hooks/cryptroot and simplify it.<p>I&#x27;ve seen other distro documenting the kernel approach instead of /etc/crypttab for the root filesystem. It may become the standard way in the future, and there&#x27;s no reason it couldn&#x27;t be fully automated. There&#x27;s some coordination between several components so it may take a bit of time to converge to an accepted and supported way thought.",1413716277

The strength of this bias varies from people to people, and from culture to culture.  But if you are asking someone to listen to the opinion of a direct subordinate, you are asking for trouble.<p>This is one reason why Michael O. Church is so big on guilds, or &quot;professions&quot;.  If instead of being a subordinate, the engineer was a (possibly certified) master craftsman, things would be different.  Just picture the manager calling the the engineer &quot;master&quot;, then <i>not</i> listen to her opinion.<p>> <i>[…] engineers […] should be trained in how to negotiate with management</i><p>Conversely, it&#x27;s harder to negotiate when you have lower status than the manager.

8477859,comment,8475809,8477676,0,0,cbsmith,,,"> First, it is not equivalent - next() cannot apply to range() output, for example - you will need to do some iter() games and watch out for iteration order side effects if your values are iterators vs. lists.<p>It uses generator/iteration semantics instead of list semantics. If you wrap the whole thing with a decorator like function that does:<p><pre><code>    def scan_wrapper(f, x0, x):\n        return list(scan(f, iter(x), x0)\n</code></pre>\nYou get the <i>exact</i> same semantics. For most cases (including the one you cited), the alternate semantics are actually better, more flexible, and avoid requiring a list to be built in the first place.<p>No problem with iteration order side effects either unless your f() somehow invalidates your iterable... and you still have some potential exposure there in your original implementation.<p>> Second, it is ~10% faster...\n> It potentially uses less memory...<p>Yeah, I think you are understating it to say the least. Not only are you using less memory, but you are saving having to rejuggle/resize the list all the time.<p>> (unless Python 3 gained TCO when I wasn&#x27;t looking. Did it?)<p>I guess in a way it sort of did for the case of yield from: &#x27;The iterator is run to exhaustion, during which time it yields and receives values directly to or from the caller of the generator containing the yield from expression (the &quot;delegating generator&quot;).&#x27;<p>So, even without full on TCO (which is still possible... I&#x27;m not sure if they did it with yield from), you at least have direct pass through from the generator to the caller. Because of iterator semantics, that should mean that each of the generators gets created on an as needed basis and the previous generator should get destroyed right thereafter. It is possible though that it isn&#x27;t quite doing it right, in which case I&#x27;ll concede that I&#x27;m still allocating an N deep generator stack, but that is still likely to be more memory efficient because it isn&#x27;t having to reallocate/resize/copy increasingly larger lists throughout the execution.<p>> recursive solutions without TCO are rarely good enough to replace iteration.<p>As I mentioned, you can do the recursive solution as well, and it has the advantage of working with old Python. Still simpler and still far more efficient (here it is with extra wrapping to keep the semantics the same):<p><pre><code>    def scan(f, x0, x):\n        def scan_helper():\n            yield x0\n            for x1 in x:\n                x0 = f(x0, x)\n                yield x0\n        return list(scan_helper())\n</code></pre>\n> It is mostly space-efficient in general.<p>You say that like when doing statistical analysis space-efficiency isn&#x27;t a concern...<p>> I think it is more idiomatic, though - and also Python2 compatible - to just replace references to &#x27;r&#x27; with yield in my code, than using the recursive definition you gave above - which is more idiomatic in functional languages, but less in Python (and harder to debug in any language than the iterative version)<p>I was actually mostly getting at using yield instead of list append. I was just trying to express it as tersely as possible, which unsurprisingly became Python 3 and a functional style mechanism.<p>While I agree that often there is a struggle to understand functional programming, I think in this case it is very idiomatic Python (particularly since they defined &quot;yield from&quot; specifically for cases like this), and the code is <i>very</i> simple, readable, and easier to verify for correctness.",1413714677

I wasn&#x27;t sure if the OP was discussing &quot;disdain towards women&quot; (what I call sexism, henceforth sexism[fajitas]) or &quot;women making different choices than men&quot; (henceforth sexism[pron]).<p>I do find sexism[pron] innocuous and I take it you disagree. I do hope to prevent you from imposing your will on those women who behave in ways you disagree with. But that belief is completely unrelated to the question of whether a larger % of people will assume the word &quot;sexism&quot; means sexism[fajitas] or sexism[pron].

You know how when you first started, you didn't really know anything, and it was a frustrating experience? If you have ever tried to teach any of your non-technical friends any programming, you would know what I mean.<p>But if you are any good at programming, you have been ""in the zone"" where it feels like your brain is working at more than peak capacity and you just know exactly what algorithm you need, where to write it, what library methods to call, etc. Feels good right?

I had always viewed exercise as something people did to lose weight which was never enough to motivate me to do it consistently. Then I read ""Spark"" by John Ratey. The idea that one could use exercise specifically to increase and maintain brain health motivated me enough to give it a shot again. It took me a while, but I eventually found a combination of things I could work into my daily schedule (Getting off the train a stop early, quick lunches followed by long walks on the embarcadero or to coit tower, running around the park near where I live and around the block in my neighborhood, etc.).

Each item has a positive weight value associated with it.<p>I would like to do the following, quickly:<p>inner loop:<p><pre><code>   Sample an item, according it its weight.

   [process...]

   Update the weight of K items, where K << N.
</code></pre>
When I say sample by weight, this is different than uniform sampling. An item's likelihood is in proportion to its weight. So if there are two items, and one has weight .8 and one has weight .2, then they have likelihood 80% and 20% respectively.<p>The number of items N remains fixed. Weights are in a bounded range, say [0, 1].
Weights do not always sum to one.<p>A naive approach takes O(n) time steps to sample.
Is there an O(log(n)) algorithm?<p>What is the appropriate data structure for this task?
I believe that red-black trees are inappropriate, since they treat each item as having equal weight.",1238006791

  that same property was exhibited by particles. He had 
  been careful when constructing his theorem to use the same

  to call it. Some people choose to call it ""free will"" only
  when there is some judgment involved. He said he felt that
  ""free will"" was freer if it was unhampered by judgment -

Don't look at official GDP figures, they're meaningless.  Look at influence, manufacturing/logistical and financial power centers, and purchasing power parity.<p>After all, what is China but a United Provinces of Asia?  You think 1.3B people are <i>naturally</i> part of the same country/culture/creed/flag?  No fucking way, to think otherwise is racist ignorance.<p>Japan is quickly being usurped by Korea as well.  Once the re-unification of Korea happens and there is a large source of inexpensive labor from the North for the developed economy in the South to employ, Japan will start its relative decline.  They've already started to use Chinese manufacturing to remain competitive and leverage what's left of their engineering/design head-start given to them by the Marshall plan and previous Imperialist mindset.<p>The big picture, folks.  It's always worth looking at.",1238004395

For example, why not make the entire cell clickable for each entry here <a href=""http://govcheck.net/party/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://govcheck.net/party/</a> ? Would greatly speed my navigation through the site.<p>You'll need a subtitle, or a one line description of your site, otherwise I'm not sure what I'm supposed to be looking for. ""Get information..."" is good, but tell me what the purpose of the site it. Something like, ""All the stats on your Indian politicians.""<p>On the graphs here, <a href=""http://govcheck.net/mp/111/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://govcheck.net/mp/111/</a> label the axis.

But handler HA somehow triggers event EB which has a handler HC that <i>depends on the state changed by HB</i>. But HB hasn't fired yet because we're still in the HA handler. The illusion of simultaneousness is violated and we're fucked.<p>The solution is to delay handling of events until all handlers for one ""generation"" of events have been called.<p>edit: So maybe he meant ""sequential"" as in ""not out-of-order"".",1238004241

A touch-surface that's 5 times larger than an iPhone enables a much richer and more sophisticated UI, and this is evident in the iPad SDK, Apple's iPad software, and the successful 3rd-party iPad software.<p>Google needs to define their tablet HIG, they need to update their SDK to implement their HIG, they need to update their built-in apps to take advantage of the new SDK, and they need to get their 3rd party developers on board.  All of this takes time, and I would not expect it to take shape before the spring or summer of 2011 (they're still ""feverishly working"" to get Android 2.2 out the door).

1453267,comment,1453130,1453130,0,0,wdewind,,,"I disagree with a lot of this.  I used to hate exercise until I was taught two major misconceptions: 1) cardio helps you lose weight, and 2) high rep/low weight = muscle tone, and low weight/high rep = big muscles.  These are patently false.<p>Cardio is NOT for losing weight.  In fact in many cases it actually is very difficult to burn fat while doing lots of cardio because it trains your body to burn the fact more efficiently.  This is why you'll see people spend so much time at the gym and get no results.  The OP is quite correct that without a serious change in diet coupled with the cardio you will NOT lose weight.  Which is exactly why you shouldn't do cardio if you want to lose weight, you may get a small drop in the beginning, but ultimately you will return to a baseline.  Pushups etc. are great for warmups, but ultimately these will have very diminishing returns as well (the ""100 pushup"" style of training is laughable).<p>If you want to burn fat and lose weight you really need to lift weights, and you need to lift heavy weights.  The idea that you can ""tone"" your muscles with small weights is just ludicrously wrong.  You wont turn into a mega-hulk, trust me.<p>If you want to increase your stamina, your lung capacity and your heart health cardio is absolutely what you should be doing.  But also understand that this comes at a cost of diminishing your muscle gains (thus slowing down how quickly you burn your fat).<p>TLDR: the best way to lose weight is to lift heavy weights in low reps (as heavy as forces you below 10 reps) with moderately short breaks between exercises.  Cardio will be an uphill battle to lose weight.<p>And the best part is you actually get to eat MORE if you are seriously lifting.<p>Edit: if you want to disagree with me and downvote, at least post a response.  I'd love to hear why you think I'm wrong.",1277242562

1453252,comment,1452410,1452871,0,0,bad_user,,,"It's the JVM's and CLR's characteristics to blame.<p>Generics in .NET are said to be reified ... meaning that when instantiating a generic type, you get that type at runtime. It also handles it smartly ... meaning that you don't get performance penalties. And for stack-allocated objects (structs in .NET or primitive types like int/double) it does code-specialization (generates a new class) which means you can avoid boxing/unboxing overhead.<p>This actually makes a difference, as reified generics are the only sane way to have sane parametric polymorphism in a language that does runtime single-dispatch (like C# / Java).<p>Reified generics are hard to implement though, especially if you want covariance/contravariance. That's why .NET only has limited support for such rules (available only on interfaces and delegates).<p>With type-erasure, as in Java or in Scala ... generics are only a way to avoid explicit type-casts (Java), or to enable local type-inference (Scala). And I have found no paper on implementing reified generics on top of the JVM, without modifying the JVM (a possible task, no doubt, but it's probably not worth the overhead).<p>Java also has another problem (which is also a problem for dynamic languages) ... no way to have custom stack-allocated objects. This is a problem since number types (int/float/double) don't map 1:1 with the types in other languages, often having different behavior / different sizes, and this is a PITA since you want to avoid the boxing/unboxing overhead.<p>Of course, the CLR is not without its problems ... like, if you want lazy integers (as in Haskell) ... you would need an Union of an integer + a method reference, and it should be a union to avoid the memory penalty (and you could make the distinction by holding 1 bit of that integer as the tag). On the CLR, you can't do it this way since there are no union types, and the security model doesn't allow you to store method references inside integers.<p>The JVM on the other hand is preferred for dynamic languages because ... it is a better target (it does runtime optimizations that the CLR doesn't) and because people wanting dynamic languages also prefer more open ecosystems.<p>.NET's DLR is an interesting piece of work, but you don't gain much performance by using it and to me it seems like another mouse trap (no really ... building DLR ASTs seems like a good idea, but what happens when your language is nowhere close to Ruby/Python or Javascript, which have similar base types and dispatching rules?).<p>It's pretty cool though that by using it you gain instant interoperability with other .NET languages.

They launched The Point with all these different group-power ideas, then struggled until they stepped back and focused on the 1 idea that stuck.<p>>Andrew: ...You’re way too dumb to figure out if your idea is good. It’s up to the masses. So build that very small thing and get it out there and keep on trying different things and eventually you’ll get it right.<p>The advice he's giving here seems to be saying two contradictory things. First, you don't know what feature will be the one that puts you on the map. Second, focus on that feature. Wait-- what?<p>He makes it sound like you should build small idea 1 and see if it works; if it doesn't, build small idea 2, etc. However, what if he followed his own advice from the start? What if they built some other group-centric idea first and that one seemed to gain some minor traction. They'd be faced with the problem of whether to stick with a mediocre idea or ditch it in exchange for a potentially great idea.<p>It's as if Andrew did a global idea search, found the best, and is coming back saying ""If only I'd done a local search in that direction instead!""",1277241254

This makes it very hard for languages on the CLR to coexist with other languages if they do not provide that parametric typing information.

However, we're just a few developers here.  We don't have a DBA.  We're much more at home with Javascript than with the MySQL trigger syntax.  So, CouchDB was a much more natural fit.<p>We're also making heavy use of the fact that CouchDB is schema-less.  I'm not too familiar with the XML and/or JSON datatypes supported by the different relational databases, but some quick googling seems to indicate that querying the database for the contents of this data can be difficult.  In other words, storing and retrieving XML appears to work OK, but (looking at Postgres) I can't seem to find a way to, for example, find all rows where the xml document in the 'xml' column has a <city> tag that is equal to 'Chicago'.  Again, I could be very wrong here, I just don't see it after about 10 minutes of looking.<p>Working with documents is very natural in CouchDB, as that is what is was designed for.  Not only can you easily find all documents with a city property equal to 'Chicago', but you can also programatically interact with that data in the map and reduce functions, using Javascript.",1277241120

That's 1.85E10^21 bits[1] of information in a single gram of purified DNA, about a forth of a zettabyte. So, if they're using DNA as the storage mechanism (the slideshow linked in the article indicates that they are), then 90GB is pretty insignificant. Sure, the bacteria will all be pretty filled with DNA, but it's not especially outlandish. Throwing compression at the information (as the slideshow discusses) makes it even less outlandish.<p>[1] Each base pair encodes two bits, as DNA and RNA is basically a base-four sequence (when we're thinking about it as data storage).",1290740299

1941527,comment,1940778,1940778,0,0,patio11,,,"I was considering writing one of these for Frontierville, since it was scarily effective at sucking me in.  I have been playing it for mental breaks during the coding for AR, and have spent... crikey... $140 on it.<p>One taste of this: they had a Thanksgiving mission, which required (as the fifth stage of the mission) you to gather 40 of item A, 40 Bs, 40 Cs, 40 Ds, and 40 Es.  ABCDE are all not available through gameplay : the only way to get them is to get your friends to give you one or to give one to a friend (gifts are symmetrical).  ""Giving"" means sending them a Facebook request.<p>Each of these items was available for 2 horseshoes (the scarce currency which can be bought for real money), plus there was a final item which cost something like 30 horseshoes.  So, if you didn't spend a few weeks spamming everyone you knew on Facebook, but you still wanted to complete your Thanksgiving quest, you just had to click the buy-for-Horseshoes button a few hundred times, and bam, quest complete.<p>I did that.  Only afterwards did I do the math: I had bought 1,000 horseshoes for $70.  350 horseshoes is... $24.50.  I just spent twenty five dollars <i>to close a dialog box</i> and get a brief flash of text on my screen inviting me to spam my friends with the fact that I had closed the dialog box successfully.<p>(The rewards for the quest are immaterial -- FrontierVille doesn't tell you what they are in advance.  It turn out to be stuff much, much less good than what you could otherwise acquire for 350 horseshoes.)<p>It isn't a good game.  But it is <i>compelling</i>.<p>Still, I have taken one lesson from Zynga that I am almost certainly going to use: they show a progress bar on the first screen, with progress totally based on taking actions which benefit Zynga.  (Installed app, get updates, bookmark app, Like app.)  Your reward for filling the bar is to have a full bar.  This is <i>brilliant</i>.  I'm stealing it to make my signup page shorter -- I'll just defer the non-critical parts until later and make successful completion a requirement for filling the bar.",1290740171

I'd suggest reading Paul Graham's essays on the subject as a basis for discussing this particular point before going any further.<p><i>For example, the usual justification people give for why they like Ruby is that it has a good UX.

Certainly my first reaction is ""you'll have to pry my parentheses from my cold, dead fingers"", but it's unarguable that a lot of people are repulsed by the syntax, even if the enlightened among us know it's actually beautiful.<p>He's right about the requirements for such a syntax: it has to mix well with the existing syntax, meaning, among other things, it must impose no semantics and it must not be necessary to write the operands of an infix expression in infix.  I don't recall CGOL etc. getting the latter right.  I also agree with him about the lack of a precedence scheme.<p>I have to admit, I can see making light use of the curly infix syntax in my own programs.  I'm less sure what I think about the modern-expressions; I'd have to try them to see.  I guess I can see some advantages.  But I'm afraid I draw the line at significant whitespace.

1941513,comment,1941373,1941373,0,0,jimbokun,,,"I think that, for those of us who like Lisp, one of the things that draws us is the elegant simplicity of it all.  There are lots of other languages that distinguish between expressions and statements, function calls and primitive operations, and all the rest of it.<p>It is undeniable that there are certain readability advantages to conforming a little more closely to the conventions from arithmetic notation, or just looking like C, which is the course most languages take.<p>But I believe that there are also very different readability advantages to a very simple, elegant, and consistent notation for representing a computation.  There are fewer things you need to remember and translate in your head to express the program you want to write, or to understand the program you want to read.<p>For the record, I favor the approach Clojure took of making access to the reader out of bounds for the Clojure programmer, and assigning distinct semantics to the various paired characters on the keyboard: [] {} ().  This breaks up the visual monotony of traditional S-expressions and improves readability.  But remains simple, elegant, and consistent, in my opinion.",1290739700

However, this comparison is very misleading: both the air travel cosmic ray exposure and chest X-rays have much higher X-ray energies and the health consequences are appropriately understood in terms of the whole body volume dose. In contrast, these new airport scanners are largely depositing their energy into the skin and immediately adjacent tissue, and since this is such a small fraction of body weight/vol, possibly by one to two orders of magnitude, the real dose to the skin is now high.""<p># ""In addition, it appears that real independent safety data do not exist.""<p><i>""Essentially, this means that the X-ray source used in the Rapiscan system is the same as those used for mammograms and some dental X-rays, and uses BOTH 'soft' and 'hard' X-rays. Its very disturbing that the TSA has been misleading on this point. Here is the real catch: the softer the X-ray, the more its absorbed by the body, and the higher the biologically relevant dose! This means, that this radiation is potentially worse than an a higher energy medical chest X-ray.</i><p><i>With that being said, because the scanners have both a radiation source AND a detector in the front AND back of the person in the scanner, it is actually possible for the hardware to conduct a classic, through-the-body X-ray. The TSA claims that the machines are not currently being used in that way; however, based on the limited engineering schematics released in the safety documents, they could be certainly be easily reconfigured to do so by altering the aluminum-plate (or equivalent) filter or by changing the software. So the hardware has the capability to output quite high doses of radiation, however a biological dose is a function of the time of exposure as well as the proximity to the source and the power of the power of the source. Unfortunately, it is difficult to determine which zones in the scanner are 'hottest' because that information is masked in the document. An excerpt of the safety evaluation from Johns Hopkins is shown below to give you sense of how much other information is being withheld. Ultimately my point is this: even though the dose may actually be low, these machines are capable of much higher radiation output through device failure or both unauthorized or authorized reconfiguration of either hardware or software.""</i><p><i>""\nWhich brings me to how the scanner works. Essentially, it appears that an X-ray beam is rastered across the body, which highlights the importance of one of the specific concerns raised by the UCSF scientists... what happens if the machine fails, or gets stuck, during a raster. How much radiation would a person's eye, hand, testicle, stomach, etc be exposed to during such a failure. What is the failure rate of these machines? What is the failure rate in an operational environment? Who services the machine? What is the decay rate of the filter? What is the decay rate of the shielding material? What is the variability in the power of the X-ray source during the manufacturing process? This last question may seem trivial; however, the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory noted significant differences in their test models, which were supposed to be precisely up to spec. Its also interesting to note that the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory criticized other reports from NIST (the National Institute of Standards and Technology) and a group called Medical and Health Physics Consulting for testing the machine while one of the two X-ray sources was disabled (citations at the bottom of the page).</i><p><i>These questions have not been answered to any satisfaction and the UCSF scientists, all esteemed in their fields and members of the National Academy of Sciences have been dismissed based on a couple of reports seemingly hastily put together by mid-level government lab technicians. The documents that I have reviewed thus far either have NO AUTHOR CREDITS or are NOT authored by anyone with either a Ph.D. or a M.D., raising serious concerns of the extent of the expertise of the individuals and organizations evaluating these machines. Yet, the FDA and TSA continue to dismiss some of the most talented scientists in the country...""</i><p><i>""Furthermore, when making this comparison, the TSA and FDA are calculating that the dose is absorbed throughout the body. According the simulations performed by NIST, the relative absorption of the radiation is ~20-35-fold higher in the skin, breast, testes and thymus than the brain, or 7-12-fold higher than bone marrow. So a total body dose is misleading, because there is differential absorption in some tissues. Of particular concern is radiation exposure to the testes, which could result in infertility or birth defects, and breasts for women who might carry a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation. Even more alarming is that because the radiation energy is the same for all adults, children or infants, the relative absorbed dose is twice as high for small children and infants because they have a smaller body mass (both total and tissue specific) to distribute the dose. Alarmingly, the radiation dose to an infant's testes and skeleton is 60-fold higher than the absorbed dose to an adult brain!</i><p><i>There also appears to be unit conversion error in the Appendix of the report, which was recently cited by the FDA in response to the UCSF scientist's letter of concern, which might mean that the relative skin dose is 1000-fold higher than the report indicates (pg Appendix B, pg ii, units of microSv are used in an example calculation, when it appears that units of milliSv should have been used). I attempted to contact the author, Frank Cerra, to query whether this was a computational mistake or an unexplained conversion; however, none of his web-published email addresses are valid and there was no answer by phone. I cannot rule out that a conversion factor was used that was not described in the methods, and would welcome confirmation or rebuttal of this observation.""</i><p><i>""Finally, I would like to comment on the safety of the TSA officers (TSO) who will be operating these machines, and will be constant 'bystanders' with respect to the radiation exposure. The range of exposure estimates is a function of where an officer stands during their duty, what percentage of that duty is spent in the same location and how often the machine is running. A TSO could be exposed to as much as 86-1408 mrem per year (assuming 8 hours per day, 40 hours a week, 50 weeks per year and between 30-100% duty and 25-100% occupancy, as defined by the Johns Hopkins report), which is between 86%-141% of the safe exposure of 100 mrem. At the high end, if for example a TSO is standing at the entrance of the scanner when it is running at maximum capacity, then that officer could hit their radiation exposure limit in as few as 20 working days (assuming an 8 hour shift). While we may not be very happy with our TSOs at the moment as the face of these policies, we need to keep in mind that they really should be wearing radiation badges in order to know their specific exposure (especially for those officers who may also have to receive radiation exposure for medical reasons).""</i><p><i>Safety reports that should be considered invalid due to the fact that one of the two X-ray sources was disabled during testing:<p>1.

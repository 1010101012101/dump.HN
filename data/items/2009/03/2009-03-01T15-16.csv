I don't see bloggers and twitterati having the same social impact as a crime beat reporter with a circuit court judge's card in his wallet. All you're going to get from that is photos, opinion, and a lot of waving and yelling. Stuff like ""secret police videos"". I don't see much crime analysis, deep reporting, and investigative news from those formats. I might be wrong, though. Does anybody know of serious in-depth crime reporting that's come from blogs? (I'm not even going to use ""in-depth"" and ""twitter"" in the same breath)",1235922765

499034,comment,498797,498797,0,0,lionhearted,,,"Craigslist always seemed like a good candidate to have its wings clipped someday. CL works because it's the most widely used classified in the States, the design doesn't get in the way, and it's free. But aside from minor redesigns, the site is stagnant. Certainly, CL isn't the best and final way to do classifieds online?<p>While CL has the network effects going on, the issue is that cross-posting an ad isn't that much effort. For instance, Recycler is big in LA, and I looked at both Recycler and CL side by side when looking for a car. I even saw a couple of the same ads posted on both sites.<p>So if a competitor builds a viable new site that grows, you'll see people use both until CL evolves or gets relegated to second tier.<p>I will say - I do like Craigslist, it seems like the founder and staff there are nice people, and I've used it for a few things and it worked well enough. I just think once someone gets classifieds more right and builds the userbase, people will look back and say, ""Damn... I can't believe we used to Craigslist all those years when it didn't have xyz, abc, or def, and it had all those ghi problems that we just took for granted.""",1235921517

499028,comment,498921,498921,0,0,bbuffone,,,"I typically utilize Alexa and Compete or others as a good way to compare sites of a similar demographic. Having access to google analytics for two different sites; one being my blog and the other site is the company I work at.<p>I know that my blog gets about half the traffic of my companies site but the corporate site is ranked 370,673 and my blog is ranked 395,487.  I would think there would be more of a difference in the two sites ranking.<p>But if I compare several of our companies competitors sites the numbers seem to line up. The numbers also make sense as trend data for a single site. I know from monitoring my blog when there is a spike in traffic; Compete and Alexa show a spike in their rankings.<p>Because Alexa captures their information through a browser plugin you want to make sure that the set of people that visit each site are equally likely to have the plugin installed.  If people that read hacker news are half as likely to install the Alexa Plugin then people that read the new york times then there would be variability in comparing those two site.",1235921271

Infochachkie, on the other hand, seems like a pretty decent site so I'm not quite sure why they were banned. Are there others which were banned that we don't know about?

But,the necessary proximity of the customer base is more dependent upon what you ar doing, who can introduce you, etc.<p>And finally, my comments about ""passivity, complacency, and parochialism"" were not directed at just the entrepreneur base - if anything, it was directed at the VC base, the Incubator base and the Mentorship base you mention in your comment above.<p>Entrepreneurs will be entrepreneurs and work hard and innovate and  . . . . . only if the rest of the Seed Community around them gives them a good reason to be Entrepreneurs.",1235920473

499011,comment,498925,498925,0,0,zepolen,,,"Yes, and it's actually easier.<p>The trick is not to think in terms of 'supporting graceful degradation', but in terms of 'javascript enhancements'.<p>Which means, do your entire app to work in html. Then add javascript wherever you can to enhance the app.<p>Force all your javascript to run /after/ the page loads, it's a constraint that will stop you from cheating.<p>An example is a delete button. Do it in html as so:<p><pre><code>    <form class=""delete"" action=""/delete/something"" method=""post""><input type=""submit"" value=""delete""></form>
</code></pre>
Then, with your framework of choice (jquery here):<p><pre><code>    <script>
    runOnLoad(function(){
       $("".delete"").submit(function(){
           var form = $(this);
           if (confirm(""Are you sure you want to delete this?"")) {
               $.post(form.attr(""action""), function() {
                   form.replaceWith(""Deleted!"");
               });
           }
           return false;
       });
    });
    </script>
</code></pre>
(Code untested)<p>So instead of the delete button causing you to go to a new page, it will just popup a confirmation, and when you click 'ok' will do the ajax call, and change the button into a 'Deleted!' message.<p>With a decent framework, the code to 'enhance' will maybe add a tiny bit of overhead in terms of loc and time, (this example for instance, 3 lines more than if it was javascript only).<p>But you get a much easier to debug app and it works everywhere to boot.",1235919930

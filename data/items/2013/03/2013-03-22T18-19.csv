5424882,comment,5423455,5423455,10,0,ahoyhere,,,"Sad to see the discussion is more about ""what'll get you customers"" instead of ""what does it mean to do business ethically.""<p>Capitalism, fine. Competitiveness, fine. Postmark is not a company afraid of customers or competition. But they believe in competing in a classy, ethical way. Most importantly, their competitive advantages are based on <i>facts</i>, things they can control, things their competitors could control but don't.<p>How can anyone disagree with that?<p>But sure, let's look at it from a ruthless, ethics-free standpoint:<p>What if you do run attack ads, what if you do kick the competitor when they have a <i>freak event</i> that they <i>did not cause</i> and <i>could not have prevented</i> -- an enormous DDoSing campaign by an organized group -- and which could happen to you, too?<p>What if you lure customers away with these attack ads?<p>What will those customers do when <i>you</i> have a freak event?<p>No service has perfect uptime. DDoSing can happen to anyone.<p>So even if you have the ethics of a rutabaga, all you get for your efforts are <i>customers which do not tolerate the occasional freak event</i>. What do you think they're going to do when <i>you</i> have something you have no control over?<p>Your marketing will have created the results that you deserve.<p>Business doesn't exist in a vacuum. You do not ""win customers for life."" Customers are not all equal (far from it). This is a long game. Being classy, being honest, is the best way to create a business you -- and your customers -- can live with for a long time.",1363978770
5424881,comment,5424241,5424690,6,0,ajross,,,"This is true, but given that unemployment in the US is still sitting at 7% (or whatever -- pick your favorite metric), we as a society have a strong incentive for them <i>not</i> to try.  It's much better for all of us that they be comfortable and (importantly!) consuming in the marketplace than that they be destitute and looking for work.<p>And even so, the disincentive thing really isn't a macro-scale problem.  During the boom years in the late 90's, for example, we came very (some might say perilously, heh) close to full employment.  If this policy, which is broadly unchnaged from what it was 15 years ago, was really a drag on the labor economy, it would have been visible then.  It really wasn't.",1363978753

5424860,story,,,1,1,Pluggr,"Pluggr.com Pre-Launch Questions",,"App Url: www.pluggr.com<p>Basic concept of the site is that you can promote anything you want, whether it's your facebook page, twitter account, links you like, startups. It's a mash up of all of that. You can only plug one thing every 24 hours, the content is moderated. I'm close to launching this little application, it seems that is is missing a couple of features and this is why I'm creating this thread.<p>The plug statistics work in the following way: When a link from the plug is clicked, whether it's the website url, twitter account, facebook page, linkedin page or youtube channel link it adds 1 to the plug statistics. Statistics are IP based, one IP can click one of the links and increase the plug count by one for each links in the plug. So example: One plug has 4 links, one user can ultimately increase the plug count 4 times by clicking each of the links within the plug.<p>1. Is location filtering a feature that users would like to see on the site. My thought was that you could attach a location to your plug so in case you're promoting an event, people can search within certain areas and find content relevant to their areas.<p>2. Feed filtering, right now I just have two options, one being ""Newest"" plugs and ""Most Plugged""<p>3. Promoted content, eventually if the site gains traction I was thinking it may be a good platform for advertisement. It is not the main goal of the site to be monetized, this is more of a fun little project at the moment.<p>I'm looking for user feedback at the moment, if you guys could suggest features to add or remove on the site it would be greatly appreciated. I would like to launch by middle / end of next week!<p>Thank you.",1363978621

Yeah, stealing from your neighbors. Its a zombie-eat-brain world out there and sometimes you gotta steal from your friends to get ahead.<p>The game uses real-world location and Foursquare data to display businesses within a three to four block radius. The app determines a businesss potential as a supply cache (food, clothing and weapons) and how many zombies could hide inside. To keep you from running into the neighborhood coffee shop only to be mauled by a zombie horde, the app assigns a threat level of one (safest) to four (Walking Dead finale kind of danger) for each business.<p>Fights are turn-based. Take a swipe with your axe or shot with your rifle by tapping a moving slide bar when its in the red hit zone. Score a few hits, then wait for the zombies to take their turn. The outcome is determined by how powerful your weapon is, what type of armor youre wearing and, as in all RPGs, a bit or random battle randomness. That means your axe might be capable of delivering 43 hit points but only gives you half that.<p>All this zombie fighting is needed to scavenge local businesses for weapons, food, medicine and clothing.

If you don't know how to invert a 3x3 matrix, you shouldn't be getting a masters in math.<p>The ultra-PC crowd seems to want it both ways.  They want minorities to be given degrees more easily than privileged white kids.  And then they want the degrees handed out to minorities to be treated as having the same meaning as degrees handed out to those privileged white kids.  But there is a fundamental contradiction here.  If an advanced math degree means something different about your qualifications based on who you are, then people will learn that and won't treat that degree equally.<p>But, how would I solve the problem?  Quite simply - I'd tackle it like our military does.  To achieve a given credential you have to perform to the same level on the same test no matter who you are.  If you are someone whose background did not prepare you, extra assistance will be made available to help you catch up.  Make the credential mean the same, and people will learn that it does and will learn to treat it the same.  You are then laying the foundation for people to treat minorities equally in the future - not because someone tells them to - but because it makes sense for them to do so.<p>(I keep resisting writing a blog post about how unequal high schools make it so that the legally safe way to hire for basic literacy is to require a college degree - which actually discriminates more strongly by race than the legally unsafe approach of being willing to hire high school kids that can demonstrate basic literacy.

5424728,comment,5421908,5424148,4,0,kbenson,,,"> To turn the question on its head, why should anyone choose Perl over the alternatives? I honestly have never seen a reason to switch.<p>Was that the implication of the original statement?  When you said you didn't see much reason for a new project to be started in Perl, I took that as any new project, even in a shop that has prior Perl experience, not a project where you are specifically looking for something different than our prior language.<p>Indeed, if you are already using one of Perl/Python/Ruby, I'm not sure I see a reason to switch from any one of those to any other.<p>If on the other hand you actually meant ""When starting a new project, I see no reason to use Perl regardless of whether that's where you have experience"", then we still have a discussion worth having.<p>> 1. Community : there's no doubt Perl's community has taken a bit of a hit over the last n years population wise. In addition, the Perl community has, anecdotally, a reputation for being a bit terse [1]. Nothing cut and dry here, but again nothing that stands out IMHO.<p>Did you actually read that link, or just read a section title and assume it made your point? Because the author updated that section saying that he really can't talk much on that point, because he wasn't there, and the evidence shows it to have been fairly civil.<p>That said, Sebastian does have a bit of a reputation for being ""terse"".  But that's one person.  Since when does one person define a whole community?<p>> 2. Libraries : by extension of a diminishing pool of active contributors, it stands to reason some modules may not be as actively supported as their counterparts in other languages. This is compounded by the uncertain state of the language's version (5,6,7?)<p>You have a lot of assumptions, and are using them as the basis for more assumptions.  How much has the community decreased?  What percentage of the community that are still active are contributors of modules, compared to similar communities of other languages?<p>Or, just look at some data: <a href=""https://metacpan.org/recent"" rel=""nofollow"">https://metacpan.org/recent</a>
Feel free to change the filter on the left to new distributions, not just new releases, to get an idea of how much active development is going on.  It may be more or less than other languages, but I think what's shown should be sufficient to disabuse you of the notion that no development is going on.<p>As for the the version number, this is a non-issue.  There is no issue of version numbers, it's a solved problem.  Some people in the community occasionally bring it up because it's a <i>sore</i> spot, and it gets a lot of play in the tech media sites, but it's really rather simple (if different than most other languages).  Perl 5 is Perl 5, and will stay so unless someone forks it and competes.  Perl 6 is a new language, intended as <i>both a successor and a companion to Perl 5</i>.  People are <i>NOT</i> expected to migrate Perl 5 code to Perl 6, it is a <i>different language</i>.  This has nothing to do with the state of the language's future.  Perl 5 is still being developed.  Perl 6 is still being developed.  Both are available, and useful, for specific subsets of uses.  For Perl 6 that happens to be a somewhat smaller subset currently because of performance issues, and some portions of the spec still being fleshed out (this is a different discussion).<p>> 3. Language : I personally have enjoyed coding in Perl, and am not really too intimidated by its historical warts. It's quite possible to write readable Perl, so write-only accusations are of little concern (to me).<p>Agreed.<p>> * Versioning : As an outsider, the current state of Perl's versioning is confusing. Perl 6 has been in development for over a decade, and I've seen mention of Perl 5.2 being released as Perl 7. None of this reflects positively on the language as a whole as it raises concerns about future proofing and maintainability.<p>Blame tech media sites for taking an internal community discussion, misunderstanding the state of things, taking random suggestions from people as real community movements, and playing it up for page views.  I'm sure we can agree the media isn't infallible.<p>I'll agree that Perl 6 is unfortunately named.  If you know the eventual goals (Perl 5 interoperability) the name makes a bit more sense, but it has caused some in the Perl 5 community to feel constrained to a version number (thus the talk of Perl 7).  In the end, this is a marketing problem (which is why you see it from the outside).<p>> * Mojolicious : Looks nice. My only concern would be that, based on the GitHub commit history, it is overwhelmingly governed and contributed to by a single individual. More so than even Rails, and significantly more so than Django. This isn't necessarily a negative, but I'd certainly want to trust him before building a production app using his tool.<p>There's a fair number of other people that have committed[2], but I won't argue the impression that it looks to be primarily Sebastian (even if there's supposedly 4-5 core developers, according to changelog notices).  That said, from your earlier link that explained him leaving the core Catalyst team[1], he <i>started</i> Catalyst, so he's got some experience in this area.<p>I feel fairly certain others would step up to the plate if he couldn't commit as much.<p>[1] <a href=""http://blogs.perl.org/users/joel_berger/2012/10/why-people-dont-like-mojolicious.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.perl.org/users/joel_berger/2012/10/why-people-d...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://github.com/kraih/mojo/contributors"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/kraih/mojo/contributors</a>",1363977453

The actual economic worth of a publishing intern is nonzero (and probably above the minimum) but unsavory. No middle-class college-educated person will work for $9.50 an hour-- it's a pride thing-- so the wage is reduced to a flat zero and the job type is redefined as a ""learning experience"". To be fair, it's not totally dishonest bullshit. If the pay is zero, the power dynamic is different. So it <i>is</i> a different kind of experience (I'm just not sure how much of one it really is).<p>I actually think that a basic income is good insofar as it removes the need for the minimum wage. Minimum wage is essentially a clumsy minimum-income program where the bill is paid by low-end employers, who respond by cutting low-end jobs, creating unemployment. In theory, without a minimum wage, we'd have zero unemployment (except for the beneficial, intrinsic kind). Add that to basic income, and the (theoretical) result still holds: full employment. Most capable people would work, for economic reasons, but the option not to work would give employees more leverage and be better, on the whole, for society.

The project seemed simple enough to me that I felt like learning Ember, Backbone, etc. might take longer than it was worth.<p>So I solved some of these issues myself with rather simple solutions/brute force. For example the navigation issue; mine is a single page app. To handle reloads I am storing a cookie with what page the user was last on and any appropriate object ids to know what to load from the API. If they come back to the app at any point before closing their browser, it remembers exactly where they were and returns them there. That of course works for Refresh as well.<p>As for being able to link to a point inside the app from outside, that's what location.hash is for. For pages users need to be able to link other people to (in my case, the page where you view the agenda and can write minutes, etc.), I update the location.hash to one that if clicked on will send them there (and takes precedence over the cookies.) Granted it's not super elegant, but it works.<p>I've found that my single page app is remarkably fast even on a slow, old computer. I'm really happy with it.

Yes they are the ones that are corrupted, and they are also the one that did the Tiananmen massacre, no need to flat out deny that. But it's ok, they are the one that also made China stronger. Don't argue saying that but all those things we are ok with are wrong on principle, when US was becoming stronger or any other country for that matter, did they do nothing wrong? Don't get me wrong though, from individual levels, I do not agree with the government's doing. However, from a national and cultural level, the party's interest is to see China grow stronger so they have more power, while we don't necessarily want to see them having more power, but we are on the same line of thinking that we want to see China stronger. Even though they may do things that harm individuality in process, I'll refrain from speaking for all of Chinese population, but at least I buy it.",1363976599

My advice to guys at conferences would probably be, don't make dick jokes in public, because it seems somebody might overreact and you might get hurt.  That has nothing to do with whether or not I think the dongle jokes are appropriate or inherently offensive.  Similarly, I don't find rmrfrmrf's comments to be super inflammatory, probably because I don't feel like my position, if any, is being attacked, but if I was way polarized on the antagonist's side of things I almost certainly would.<p>Do we want to encourage crazy volatile feminism at conferences?  Obviously no.  Do we want to encourage even crazier volatile misogyny on the internet?  Obviously no.  Is it unreasonable, or unkind even, to encourage someone who is complaining about the negative attention they are receiving, who I perceive to be actively encouraging that negative attention without realizing it, to tone it down a little?  Personally, I don't believe so, but if it falls on deaf ears, it falls on deaf ears.  I just don't think that the anxiety of receiving death threats is good for anyone, and that level of anxiety can cause people to make choices that have big long term consequences.  Adria has already demonstrated a predisposition to overreaction that has already led to long term consequences, and death threats are significantly more serious than whatever happened at the conference.  It is not unreasonable to assume that someone actively defending her position might also overreact.<p>There are lots of things that I do everyday that I wouldn't do in an ideal world, but that nevertheless make existence tolerable, good even.

If someone does get hit by a car while playing in a park, you don't suggest to that person they should avoid playing in the park.<p>> What about if it is telling women to go out with their friends and look after each other when they are at bars? To be aware of their surroundings? Is that victim blaming to prepare your daughter for the realities of the world?<p>No, that's good advice!  And there is a distinct difference.<p>Yes, I know, the reality is that wearing provocative clothes <i>can</i> entice men, and some men will get the wrong idea, and might do bad things.  But it's a bad solution to adopt the ""change what you wear"" approach.  It doesn't solve the problem.<p>Basically, it's the same as this type of advice: If you don't want to get into an accident, don't use a car.  Of if you dont' want to get into an plane crash, don't fly a plane.  If you don't want to drown, stay out of water.<p>Or, if you don't want to get raped, look ugly.<p>But telling you daughter to go with friends, to be aware, to check in? These don't change her behavior.  It minimizes risk.  Indeed, if you think about it, the advice you give up there is much better than not wearing provocative clothing.  Mostly because wearing provocative clothing has little to do with getting raped.<p>Anyways, I hope you understand better what I was trying to say.  Again, it's not some new concept that I'm spouting.  Spend some time reading up on it.  Others do a better job at explaining it then I do.",1363975342

How shameless A little bit of the old story for those who don't know:<p>Around 2001~2002, NUDT, Lenovo Group, and a few other organizations took a government grant of 70 million RMB and claimed to independently created a new operating system with their own copyright/IP for defense use called Galaxy Kylin.<p>In 2006, an analysis [1] of the new OS revealed that Kylin was most likely a fork of FreeBSD, which voided the previous independent creation and copyright/IP claims. Worse, they did not follow FreeBSD license when distributing the software.<p>When the scandal was published and went crazy in the media the same year, another interesting incident happened: access to www.freebsd.org was blocked from mainland China. In fact, the term FreeBSD became a sensitive keyword that if you mention it anywhere on any page, your connection will be cut-off and subsequently blocked, not just www.freebsd.org [2]. Of course there was no official statement regarding the connection between the two (what do you expect anyway), given the deep involvement of NUDT and the Great Firewall, one has to wonder<p>Looks like they learned something from that scandal and this time they acknowledged the adoption of Ubuntu/Linux upfront. Let's see what will happen next.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.dancefire.org/article/Kernel_Similarity_Analysis.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dancefire.org/article/Kernel_Similarity_Analysis....</a> (in Simplified Chinese)<p>[2]: <a href=""http://www.williamlong.info/archives/406.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.williamlong.info/archives/406.html</a> (in Simplified Chinese)",1363975335

""However, it's worth noting that more than a quarter of the professors felt that their successful MOOC students do deserve credit. Those respondents include faculty members at Penn, Princeton, Duke, and Stanford. Most of them led courses that were oriented to math, science, and engineering.""<p>Which makes sense, those are subjects which are probably best suited to this kind of approach.<p>I've taken a number of MOOCs, from EDx, Coursera, and Udacity.  I'm an addict, always in at least one and plan to pretty much permanently keep doing them as long as it's possible to do so.<p>The 6.002x from EDx was probably the most rigorous of the ones I've done, and I felt a solid sense of accomplishment when it was over. But I don't think I should be awarded MIT credit for it, mostly due to the limited substitutions for lab work.<p>In fact, I don't think college credit would be appropriate for any of the classes I've done. However, the certificates for most of them do have meaning, and should be taken by employers as a sign that someone is likely to have some competency in the area.<p>Yes, cheating is possible, so it's not automatic, but you should always be evaluating someone's actual skills that matter to you anyway.  An A in a class on their college transcript also doesn't guarantee mastery in any way whatsoever.  It's just an indicator that the person may have such.",1363975286

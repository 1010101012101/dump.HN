I personally think the approach is flawed.<p>I would start with a real factory that can make everything in the factory. It would probably be the size of a big building.<p>Just like the first computers.<p>Refine the components, and make it smaller and smaller.<p>The initial goal shouldn't be a tiny maker, but something light enough to send to Mars or the Moon. I've been told (by one of Hod Lipson's students actually), that NASA estimates such a factory today would weigh in at 100 tons. That seemed small to me. They should try to make this.<p>It's the first thing you'd need to make if we knew of a big asteroid that couldn't be stopped.",1225420953

349552,comment,349383,349383,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Ooh, they finally launched.  Congrats Alex!<p>Edit: some feedback...<p>1.) It doesn't seem to work on IE6.  I added the bookmarklet according to the instructions (some of the formatting is messed up there, BTW, like the vertical ""Feedback"" link is overlaying the center of the page), but clicking on it doesn't do anything.<p>2.) Is there anyway to get the green snip bar to disappear once you've clicked the bookmarklet?  I guess it goes away when you navigate away from the page, but it's distracting until then.<p>3.) For better browsing convenience, it'd be neat if the Snipd bookmarklet toolbar <i>didn't</i> disappear, and followed you around as you surfed.  I don't see a way to do this, though, short of proxying pages through snipd.com and using the hash URL trick like TheSixtyOne does.<p>4.) I'm glad that snips are easily unhighlightable.<p>5.) It's clever that you put the vimeo tutorial in the bookmarklet, but it'd be even cleverer if it wasn't necessary at all.  I'm not sure what to <i>do</i> once I've selected and snipped something (and I guess I'm only aware that I'm supposed to <i>select</i> first because I've talked to you in person), and users tend to have their fingers on the back button.  If you could make the value proposition for the snipper <i>immediately</i> clear from the text & appearance of the bookmarklet bar, that'd help new users immensely.<p>6.) Grammar is off on the blog - ""You can follow blog"".  Clever that you're using Snipd itself as the blog.   How about renaming it as ""The Snipd Blog"", so that the sentence reads ""You can follow The Snipd Blog.""  Also works better with the next sentence as well.",1225419611

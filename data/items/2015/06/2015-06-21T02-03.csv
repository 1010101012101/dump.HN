I found it even easier than Knockout which is saying a lot.<p>- Injectable into a pre-existing project that was not designed around using ReactJS.<p>Things that have bugged me:<p>- Having to add a JSX build step (yes I know you can avoid JSX but it&#x27;s ugly)<p>- No standard Flux implementation the community can rally around<p>- There is a big community focus on utilizing bleeding edge front-end tech such as ES6 (using Babel) and CommonJS (through browserify/webpack), all installed through NPM.

It&#x27;s great, creating sophisticated interactions is a lot simpler with flux and react.<p>Flux is very boilerplate-y, even with some of the lighter frameworks. But boilerplate isn&#x27;t particularly complicated, so you get over it.<p>If I were going to a hackathon I would not use flux+react, I&#x27;d probably go with angular. If it&#x27;s something I plan on maintaining over a long period of time, react is currently my big choice.<p>Testing react is very nice, especially coming from angular where testing directives was very painful. (And testing everything else was needlessly verbose.)<p>I made a VERY simple project starter [0] that I&#x27;m going to take the chance to plug now. It&#x27;s built for frontend web applications in mind, and it focuses on giving you the starting environment to build an app. It provides development, testing, and production builds. In development you get live-reload and hot-loading of assets. In production you get minification, concatenation, and cache busting of assets, as well as getting all assets copied to your output folder. There&#x27;s a live testing environment (i.e. watch files and run tests) as well as a single-run environment. Tests also generate code coverage reports. The best part is that it doesn&#x27;t use gulp or grunt, it&#x27;s just a webpack config with a few flags per environment type, and to run every task you just use npm run-scripts. Out of the box it handles ES6/ES7/JSX, CSS, images and fonts, but extending it to support other assets is trivial. I took the time to heavily comment the webpack config in order to help people out.<p>EDIT: My coworker pestered me to edit this and mention that we&#x27;re hiring [1].

9751939,comment,9751613,9751913,0,0,pdabbadabba,,,"True enough. But the point is that this would greatly limit your options relative to a JD. If you happen to be interested in a field where a German law degree would be a benefit, then great. But that is probably not true for most people.<p>Having been tangentially involved in legal recruiting, U.S. law firms are very much looking for people who satisfy particular criteria, and these criteria are developed with the assumption that a student went through the conventional American legal education system. (Think, GPA, law journal experience, moot court, judicial clerkships [yes, you can get one with an LLM, but it will be much harder without the faculty connections you build over several years], etc.)  In short, they are looking for a &quot;certain kind&quot; of resume. For most, a German law degree with a U.S. LLM will not readily meet that test. I&#x27;m not saying, of course, that it will be impossible to get a job. I&#x27;m just saying that a person with that sort of resume will be swimming upstream compared to her UT friends with JDs.<p>It might be tempting to say that you would not want to work someplace that takes this approach to hiring.

Trying to apply simple FRP-style abstractions over state changes like Signals becomes infinitely more tractable in React, where components are just functions that return data (as opposed to most frameworks, like Angular, with their very effectful controllers and other code).<p>Also, having worked with both Angular and React alongside less experienced developers, I&#x27;ve noticed developers in general doing a lot less stupid shit with React (not to say none, just less). Angular doesn&#x27;t have many strong philosophies about programming, so it&#x27;s largely up to the programmer to make good decisions rather than have the framework make the right thing feel right - the latter, in my opinion, being what growing developers need.<p>My sample sizes have been limited though, so take this advice with a grain of salt.

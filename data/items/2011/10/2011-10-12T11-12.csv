Taking classes helped define what I like.<p>I thought I wanted to be a chemist, but after taking Chem 161 I realized I HATE EVERYTHING ABOUT CHEMISTRY. I thought I wanted to major in math but I barely passed Calculus III and the class was a huge drag. Then I started taking art classes and realized art was awesome. I've stayed for hours before and after the class finishing paintings, going to the galleries, hanging at the galleries, it was just so fun and I stuck with art for over a year.<p>But then I realized there's not a lot of money in art (for me) so I started studying design (especially since I have background in web-development so that helps).<p>I guess I'm better off than 100 days ago (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2725893"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2725893</a>) in that I at least am somewhat more determined with goals in life, somewhere in the arts/design industry.

Certainly the major initiatives haven't moved forward.<p>I don't think Bezos has a technical background... I thought he was a hedge fund guy before moving out to Seattle.  But I agree with everything else you said.<p>The funny thing was, when I got hired I was told that they were going to let people use Macs and that it would be a few months.  I had my own laptop I was willing to bring in and use, and though they were trailing macs with a few people, I was told I'd be fired if I used my personal mac for work.<p>So, I had to use a piece of crap HP laptop. The thing was always in the shop.  There were many days when I basically lost an entire days worth of work because it would break. They replaced it several times. (and I was babying it.. .it lived on my desk for the most part.)<p>So, not only could they have had zero costs by letting me use my own machine, but they lost more than the cost of the laptop several times over in lost productivity by me not being able to work when the machine they made me use was in the shop.<p>And when I left, they still hadn't approved macs (or maybe the IT department decided they were ""too insecure"" or some BS.)<p>While I was there, they were constantly starting initiatives and then abandoning them.

They'd start some project, do a press release, then disband the team and never advance the code again... it would just sit there and rot.<p>I think one of the reasons that most of management there is not technical is that non-technical people are threatened by technical people in that role.

I was scared of Math.  I spoke only one language.  My confidence was shattered through 9 years of being bullied.<p>Now I'm 31.  I'm 10 stone lighter.  I'm married to the girl I met when I was 21.  I've leant to love Math.  In addition to English, I speak fluent Dutch.  Heck, I live in a different country (UK to Netherlands).  In a couple of weeks I'll be starting at a new, better job.  That's going from a previous good job :)<p>Freelancing at your age is a joke.  You'll just be taken advantage of.  You don't have the experience to be able to demand a decent rate.

Focus your education to improving it.  Miss some Math?  Grab the Dummies books.  Read them.  Follow the MIT lectures.  Then put the knowledge to use in a personal project.  Write a flash Thrust clone.  Or Mario clone.  Write a charting library.<p>Don't try and go straight into IT.  You don't have the experience.  Get that experience via the side routes.  Start as office monkey.  Then help colleagues with Excel.  Build them a database.  Grow.<p>Don't get hung up on formal education.  In IT it's not that important.  The field moves much faster than other professions - continuous learning is more important than having done a specific degree.<p>Take my example.  I know more, and am better at my craft than my university-educated coworkers.  Why?  Because I've worked harder than them.  I've been coding for a similar amount of time, despite being 15 years younger (started at 11).  I read like crazy.  I've taught myself a lot (with a bit of help from MIT's open access scheme).  I'm a perfectionist, and that drives me to improve.  Constantly.  And ultimately I love my field.  I love learning.<p>My highly educated coworkers are lazy.  They use their degrees as an excuse not to invest in their skills.  Sure, they spent three years studying computer science in the 80s.  But a lot has changed since then.  They know little to nothing about software engineering.  They never think about how to improve themselves.  They hide behind a Phd or MSc.<p>If you need to talk to someone with similar experiences who can give you tips, then drop me a line.",1318420164

We all don't get it. The Golden Rule of platforms is that you Eat Your Own Dogfood. The Google+ platform is a pathetic afterthought. We had no API at all at launch, and last I checked, we had one measly API call. One of the team members marched in and told me about it when they launched, and I asked: ""So is it the Stalker API?"" She got all glum and said ""Yeah."" I mean, I was joking, but no... the only API call we offer is to get someone's stream. So I guess the joke was on me.<p>Microsoft has known about the Dogfood rule for at least twenty years. It's been part of their culture for a whole generation now. You don't eat People Food and give your developers Dog Food. Doing that is simply robbing your long-term platform value for short-term successes. Platforms are all about long-term thinking.<p>Google+ is a knee-jerk reaction, a study in short-term thinking, predicated on the incorrect notion that Facebook is successful because they built a great product. But that's not why they are successful. Facebook is successful because they built an entire constellation of products by allowing other people to do the work. So Facebook is different for everyone. Some people spend all their time on Mafia Wars. Some spend all their time on Farmville. There are hundreds or maybe thousands of different high-quality time sinks available, so there's something there for everyone.<p>Our Google+ team took a look at the aftermarket and said: ""Gosh, it looks like we need some games. Let's go contract someone to, um, write some games for us."" Do you begin to see how incredibly wrong that thinking is now? The problem is that we are trying to predict what people want and deliver it for them.<p>You can't do that. Not really. Not reliably. There have been precious few people in the world, over the entire history of computing, who have been able to do it reliably. Steve Jobs was one of them. We don't have a Steve Jobs here.

And for volunteer things it's incredibly likely a person on HN knows more about psychology than the volunteer and can help themselves more-so by learning about why they feel the way they feel instead of repeating stuff they already say to themselves to a passive listener who may just repeat it back.

It doesn't matter if its relevant or not.  It doesn't matter if the person who doesn't like you knows nothing about programming.

Only, that person will also be included in in the interview loop.  They have an incentive to say no, because they want the job.<p>Inside Amazon, this is called ""keeping a high hiring bar"". So, they go thru great expense and hassle to bring people in, and then pat themselves on the back when they arbitrarily rule someone out.  Saying no, means they're doing their job, keeping that bar high!  They once said no to a guy I'd worked with previously, who, as far as I'm concerned, was a much better programmer than me.

You just feel worse about it because your job was ""high paying"", which is really just a quirk of circumstance and totally meaningless.<p>If you really wanted a soulless but high-paying job you hate, you'd be at Yale preparing for a career in finance.<p>It sounds like you don't really know what you want to do with your life right now. Nobody really does at 20. So I'm going to give you some advice nearly everyone here will hate: go to college.<p>My parents threw me out when I was 18, and I learned a few things really quickly. The most important was that in California, you can go to community college for free as long as you're poor (which I was by default as a line cook/graveyard shift baker), and knock out two out of four years of a bachelor's degree just dicking around, trying different things in different departments until something clicks.<p>You'll learn a ton. Most of it won't have to do with your degree. That totally doesn't matter and it's not the point.<p>With just a little bit of focus, you can come away with an associate's degree and a killer transfer application to get you in to a better college. Or, you can just drop out, and hopefully you'll at least have a better idea of what you want to do with your life, a little bit of experience, and a larger professional network than you started with.<p>I built my freelance programming and design career by teaching myself those skills while taking classes[1] and working in kitchens. By the end of the first half of year two, I wasn't working in kitchens anymore. Now my school is paying me to finish my bachelor's degree, and I'm turning down job offers every time I go to a meetup for my field, one that everybody tells me is supposed to be dying or something.<p>The other most important thing I learned was how to be happy while poor (not fake college student poor where you can always call your parents for more money, but real poor where you have a jar of peanut butter until pay day next week and your heat is turned off), and that poverty is worth not being subject to others' expectations and living on your own terms.<p>Not having money is not a real problem. Living with shitty parents who yell at you about money and wanting to kill yourself is. Get the fuck out of there and go to college. You will not regret it, as long as you don't pay for it.<p>I second the advice to stay off of Hacker News, because it's generally full of privileged overachievers who will make you feel worse (though not consciously) about your situation.<p>If you want any specific details about how to accomplish any of these things, feel free to contact me, info is in my profile.<p><i>1. Some of you are saying to yourselves, ""Why were you teaching yourself while going to college? That's dumb, you shouldn't have been in college!"" It's because outside of ""elite"" universities, programming knowledge is usually woefully out of date, and the nature of this field is such that the only one with any authority to say it's out of date is the one teaching the out-of-date course material. History, philosophy, and writing skills are much less dependent on the state of the art, and it's easier to find a skilled, accesible and receptive mentor in all of these fields than it is in programming or computer science.</i>",1318418795

What you learn from this experience and how you eventually overcome it will put you ahead of those people who never take a risk and make fun of you.  When events outside of their control hit them they will not be equipped to deal with it effectively.  Normally hitting rock bottom has always been a turning point for me.  It's where you don't worry about pride that much and do the things you really have to do to dig yourself out again.  In most cases I was back into well paying work within a year and on top of my finances again after two years, and better than I have been before.  Also, just like the experience you gain with startups failing, you learn how to fail more gracefully each time.  You also learn how wrong you can be even if you think you've planned to move on through it gracefully.  Next time you'll probably just look for a less unreasonably demanding job instead of trying to create one from scratch, or do it in a partnership with someone who has experience, or find a consulting job where you can start reducing your days over time.  But before that is dealing with what you are going through now, the small, hard but pragmatic steps you go through to start earning some income, to start dealing with people in real life again so you feel more confident socially which leads to more opportunities, being able to pay the basic bills so you can survive until that all works out.",1318418730

I purchased a 450k home through financing when I turned 20, had two high end cars and a third (money pit) project car that I barely had time to work on.<p>Long story short, I was your age (20) at the time and I did what most 20yr olds do, bought whatever I wanted no matter the price. I thought life like this would last forever, with no care for the term ""housing bubble"", I didn't care to know what the worst of it would mean.<p>When 2007 came around and I saw lenders severely restrict guidelines and homes start appraising at an incredibly devalued price from what it once was, that was when I started to panic. Eventually I had to short sell my home, turn one of my cars in because I owed more then the value of it and go from 15-20k to basically nothing.<p>So I ended up moving to Miami beach for two years staying with a relative, and spent all of my money pretending to still be/do what I once was/could until i ran completely out of money. Then I sat in depression for the rest of the two years I was there. Things really got bad after my second car got repossessed.<p>Anyway, the story is of a person (me) falling from high up all the way to rock bottom which it sounds like is where you are. After the two year period of depression I got a second chance through moving back to Illinois and staying with my parents, going back to college and programming again. Now I have three partners working on a new product, face time with VC's that have shown interest when its completed, introduced to business owners (through friends) that have agreed to test our product. Things are going great.<p>There is one thing that happened to me which changed my outlook on life when things weren't going so well(im not saying you should go and do this by any means at the moment), I had a son and so far he has been my inspiration in pulling through.<p>Right now I am 25, my plan that I set for myself when I was 16 was to have over $1 million by the time I was 25, you can laugh at that if you want but i was serious and it was definitely possible at the rate that I made money as a Loan Officer. You still have a shot at achieving either the goal of stability or creating your own job by the time you are 25. Figure out which route you want and make a plan to get there, i.e. ""Get a GED. 4 months, goto community college/university for CS or whatever 2-4 years."" By that time you should have a side job and a nearly completed BS in CS.<p>You have time, you have talent. Make a goal, define a path and start going down it. The longer you wait and sulk in your depression the more depressed you will get being 21,22,23,24,25yrs old and in the same situation you are currently in. Don't do that.<p>You'll never find out what you have to look forward to if you never attempt to look forward, so dont look back, move forward.",1318418722

Especially a place where the people who hang out tend to be fast moving and with a quick, brutal approach to problems such as that you describe.<p>That's not outright blame for you; we're as much at fault for taking one part of the info and giving you advice on it - no one in the thread seemed to couch their advice with ""but talk to your friends/family"" etc. Which is probably part of the problem.<p>You mention the idea of freelancing as a revenue to keep you going; but it is not clear a) what your experience is and b) how much research you did into doing that sort of work as freelance. This is usually killer; I quit an OK job once to go freelance - it didn't work out because I didn't do the work.<p><i>Tell us about your skills - someone here on HN will likely have some work for you</i><p>Don't get depressed though; you're probably feeling like a failure, but realistically you were in a bad place and decided to try something radical to fix it. That hasn't worked - so try something else!<p>The suggestion below to go work in a supermarket while you build up freelance work & side projects is a good one. There is nothing wrong with manual labour, especially in your 20's. And if you are worried about being stuck there long term - constantly work <i>not</i> to be there long term.<p>Building a career is fucking hard. It sounds like you had a lucky break initially - a well paid job. But for a high trade off (horrible working conditions). Now you have to do like the rest of us :)<p>I'm guessing you were sold the ""get rich quick"" and ""quitting my job was the best thing..."" idea. This is an unfortunate side effect of HN... because it largely doesn't work - and certainly not without intense effort and drive.<p>Your 20; this is a setback, but it's certainly not the end. In 30 years time there is <i>no reason</i> it couldn't be you interviewing with Time, and telling them that this was the failure that drove you from them on - or something (note; a lot of work required!).<p>And tell the people abusing you to get lost; sounds like they are a large part of your pain/depression & likely what it holding you back.<p>Maybe volunteer for one of those charity trips - go build a school somewhere away from the people that are getting you down. Meet new people, get new ideas. etc.",1318418703

3102464,comment,3101876,3102367,78,0,potatolicious,,,"On the contrary, the way Amazon treats their employees <i>does</i> harm them substantially, they just haven't paid the price visibly to the public (or quite as hard as they will, eventually).<p>Attrition at Amazon is at <i>horrific</i> rates. I know the actual number, though I'm pretty sure that'd violate my NDA to reveal. It's high. It's really high. Guess a really truly terrible number. It's probably higher than that.<p>The stream of people leaving the company isn't a trickle as it is a well-managed places. It isn't even a modest stream. It's an outright deluge, particularly in this market where everyone else is desperate and willing to pay (protip: Amazon, as a rule, is not).<p>This is starting to show itself in <i>many</i> places in the company. In a lot of places there are no longer <i>any senior engineers left</i> who know how the system works. In their place are fresh-faced college grads struggling to contend with a system they neither have the experience nor the documentation to maintain, much less extend. The average tenure of the Amazon engineer is <i>embarrassingly</i> short, and coupled with the company's notorious lack of documentation, it means that technical debt is accumulating at an alarming rate.<p>There are constantly projects to completely revamp/redesign some portion of Amazon's systems. In my observation this is less about an honest improvement over the old system (sometimes there IS no improvement) but rather because <i>nobody knows how the fuck the old thing works</i>. The truly sad thing is, they have trouble keeping engineers around long enough to even see <i>that</i> redesign through.<p>If you know where to look on Amazon's site, you would see lots of evidence of this already. Extremely deep integration into systems that literally <i>no one still with the company</i> understands. Tons of mission critical code whose original author is long gone, no documentation exists, and in fact the code <i>isn't owned by any team</i>. I've seen many hacks to work around these problems, though I doubt they'd be super apparent to the common Amazon shopper.<p>The problem here, like many other companies in a similar stage, is that very little of Amazon's management has a technical background at this point. Bezos certainly does, and I still think he's one of the best CEOs in the industry right now, but many of his underlings... not so much. A lot of management do not <i>see</i> this accumulation of technical debt. Difficulties working <i>with</i> said debt is perceived as either ""natural"" difficulties of working with technology, or worse, incompetence. Amazon's internal existence is a depressing cycle of: hire people, people spend eons learning how the previous guys did it, people write code, people get fed up and leave, hire more people, people spend eons learning how the previous guys did it...<p>If any Amazonian management is reading, I have one thing I really want to drive home: <i>stop being so fucking ""frugal"" with equipment</i>. It is a <i>travesty</i> that my development desktop was a Celeron worth $300 on eBay. Not because I like having the newest shiny, because <i>I couldn't even run multiple dev environments on it, like I had to for my JOB</i>, and building my code took 12 full minutes, instead of, say, 3. Stop shitting on your devs with dinky 5 year-old monitors and give them some screen real estate. There are <i>plenty</i> of studies that outright prove the productivity boost that comes with bigger monitors.",1318418403

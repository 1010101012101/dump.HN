We now count them as a full person.  What changed other than perspective/brain state?<p>Even with sheep, consider the possibility that out of say 10 of the sheep you counted, one or all of those sheep are pregnant.  Not only that, but you don't know which are or may be pregnant, or how many sheep they may be pregnant with.  Does an unborn sheep even count as a full sheep?  And yet you counted 10 sheep, and if counting sheep works without changing perspective, then there are 10 sheep regardless.  I'm not sure I would agree with that.",1278399478

1490217,comment,1489989,1490178,0,0,lionhearted,,,"Yes, but maybe in a different way than you'd think. There was a divide in Imperial Japanese politics - the Emperor wanted to end the war and was looking to surrender pre-Hiroshima. The heads of the military were split on a course of action - some wanted to fight to the end, but a more common position was trying to fight enough to get more favorable terms than just unconditional surrender.<p>It's common enough to fight a losing effort to get better surrender terms, and that's probably what would have happened. The United States never wanted to land invade Japan - the second option to bombings was a blockade to starve the army out. Do the Japanese still unconditionally surrender if they go that route? Could the Imperial Japanese Army be enough of a menace that the U.S. leadership takes less than unconditional surrender for terms? Maybe.<p>The most interesting question is what happens if Japan doesn't unconditionally surrender, become occupied, and have the MacArthur transition government put into place. It was hell at the time for Japan, but then Japan became an American protectorate and was able to run their government with one of the lowest military expenditures in the Western world. They were also well-protected from the various brutal Communist regimes in the area. Could Japan have been invaded by Red China or the Soviet Union if the Empire had kept more sovereignty and wasn't an American protectorate?<p>Interesting questions. After the Battle of Midway, the Japanese had already lost to the American forces and it was just a matter of time. The war was going to end, nuclear bombings or not. The question is when and on what terms. Japan got the worst possible terms - unconditional surrender, full disarmament, dissolution and loss of all colonies, and foreign military occupation - but then it works out that it becomes the most prosperous place in Asia. Funny world.",1278399224

While that fact merely correlates with the CS grad employment rate, the two trends may share a cause: per-employee cost.<p>A common argument is that, in a recessive economy, women maintain a higher employment employment rate because they tend to make considerably less than men, given the same position and experience, therefore incurring less of a cost to their employers. Similarly, CS (and other technical degrees), have a considerably higher minimum expected cost - I'd guess the salary of a junior dev to still be around 50K US.

Both developing web apps and graphic design are highly skilled professions, graphic designers can take years to develop the expertise to design something truly great just as it can take years to develop the skills required to develop successful webapps.<p>Your logo is the single most important part of your brand and it drives the graphic design of the rest of you website. It is true that anyone with a little time can create a logo by choosing a typeface adding some colour and a drop shadow but making a logo that tells you something and holds a message is much much harder. I would be tempted to say that logo design is probably the hardest aspect of graphic design to master. For an example of a very clever logo that hold a hidden message take a look at the FedEx logo, see if you can spot the hidden image. Designing both a logo and a webapp are about knowing the audience and what makes them tick.<p>With that said something like 99 designs is actually a good way to get a first logo for your webapp. You can always iterate on the logo when you know the market is ready for your app, just don't underestimate it's importance.Â ",1278398085

But it is is possible to just use a stack/queue an forget about the heuristic, then you get a nice generic way of tree (graph) traversal.<p>Regarding your use of white/black/grey lists: in a tree (which is acylic), you would only need a list of nodes to visit, however, in a general graph you need to keep a list of nodes that you have already seen/visited so as not to get into a cycle when the graph is cyclic. In tracing garbage collection algorithms this is often used because the live program data generated by the mutator is cyclic, or at least potentially can be. Thanks for mentioning this, though I know my way around gc stuff, too, I would have never come up with this link here! Probably it is a good advice to anybody interested to spend some time reading into garbage collection algorithms, they contain many interesting algorithms on graphs, such as the Deutsch-Schorr-Waite algorithm for tree traversing without requiring an additional stack.

Unless they have something platform/device specific in mind, like in app purchases, push notifications, using the camera or compass or if the UI is important, it often does not make sense to create an app.<p>Most important, however, is the user (surprise, surprise). What is the task the user will perform at your site/with your app?

1490137,comment,1489166,1490053,0,0,nostrademons,,,"ii.) I'd noticed a while ago that all graph traversal algorithms follow the same pattern.  There is a white set of undiscovered nodes, a grey set of discovered-but-unvisited nodes, and a black set of visited nodes.  To execute the graph traversal, you push a start node into the grey set, and then recursively pop a node off the grey set, add any children of it that are currently in the white set to the grey set, and repeat until everything is in the black set.  The structure of the grey set determines the particular traversal algorithm:<p>1. If it is a stack, then you have a depth-first search, which visits all children first and then moves on to siblings.<p>2. If it is a queue, then you have a breadth-first search, which visits all siblings first and then starts recursing into children.<p>3. If it is a priority queue keyed by edge weights, then you have Dijkstra's algorithm, which will find the shortest path to any node in the graph.<p>4. If it is a priority queue keyed by in-degree of nodes, then you have a topological sort.<p>5. If it is a priority queue keyed by the lowest edge weight such that the endpoint of the edge is in the black set, then you have Prim's algorithm for minimum spanning trees.<p>You can have more exotic data structures too, eg.:<p>6. If it is a linked-list encoding of a stack done through pointer reversal, you have a mark & sweep garbage collector.<p>7. If it is a test on whether the pointer points to from-space or to-space, you have a Cheney-style breadth-first copying garbage collector.<p>I'd never seen a formalism that described this - it was just something I figured out when I was implementing my 3rd or so topological sort.  I assumed that something like that must exist though - the notion of white/grey/black sets for graph traversal is well established in at least the garbage collection literature, and from there it's a short leap to figure out what structure of the grey set corresponds to which graph algorithm.<p>I just took a quick look at the A* entry in Wikipedia - I've heard of it but never had a reason to implement it myself - but it seems like it's a generalization of Dijkstra's algorithm where edge weights can be arbitrary functions.  In this case, it's the same as case #3, but the keys to the priority queue are a function of the node instead of a straight list of edge weights.",1278396819

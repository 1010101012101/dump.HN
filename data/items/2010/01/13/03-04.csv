Like a lot of things Microsoft, the early versions of D3D were pretty poor, but they listened to feedback from devs and so on and iterated it up to a worthwile competitor to OpenGL, which stood still for many a year (extensions notwithstanding).<p>Also early on I think driver support was an important factor in D3D getting traction, as proper OpenGL support was mostly only in the blindingly expensive workstation graphics market.<p>Nowadays I think on the PC most games are D3D because that gets you a long way towards an xbox360 port.",1263355116

It happens that the Amtrak Downeaster line (<a href=""http://amtrakdowneaster.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://amtrakdowneaster.com/</a>) is unique in having WIFI, but it wasn't Amtrak that set up the service, rather it was the Northern New England Passenger Rail Authority.  That is, a local authority, which is more directly accountable to the riders of that line, a far cry from Amtrak's ""accountability"" to Congress.<p>Likewise, the other decent line I've ridden, the Cascades line (www.amtrakcascades.com/) is largely supported by & accountable to the Washington and Oregon state governments.<p>Amtrak is a decades-old failed experiment.

It's worth remembering that ""hacking"" is typically ill-liked, even by some of those claiming to practice it.<p><i>Start with purpose. With the exception of art software projects (which I don't believe Graham has in mind here) all computer programs are designed to accomplish some kind of task.</i><p>I suppose this guy is a Java programmer?...<p><i>No one cares how pretty the code is if the program won't work.</i><p>...that or Perl.<p><i>Great paintings, for example, get you laid in a way that great computer programs never do.</i><p>#%$hole...<p>PG could have alluded to the similarity between Math and hacking.  The thing that I feel both share is that there is an underlying beauty to a well-crafted result.  Truly beautiful results (like original self-printing program in Lisp) withstand the test of time, like a universal truth.  Thus a program is not like an egg made by a chef, or even a Porsche made by an engineer.<p>The flip side is that there's no ""way"" to write a program.  There actually isn't even really a notion of truth.  Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.  The only constraint I have as a programmer is to (1) not run out of memory and (2) not run out dough (which would force me to quit hacking and get a ""real job"").  There are some people who think that obfuscated C is art, and there's FP folks like me who would fire someone for writing anything in that godawful language (Which might be unfair.  People should only be fired for writing Java on the job).  I think this is pretty strong support in favor or programming as an art.<p>The other piece of evidence I cite is that the academic form of hacking is called Computer Science and we know what they say about anything that has the word ""Science"" in it...<p>Basically, the only premise of idleword's argument that holds up is that artists get laid and programmers don't.  I will resist fighting fire with fire on this point.<p>But maybe PG should allude to poets or composers next time.  Apparently some painters are real jerks.",1263352191

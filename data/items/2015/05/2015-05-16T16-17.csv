You suggest that blacks are innately inferior to Asians in terms of intelligence, which is nonsense. (Note the post below about IQ issues. There is considerably more research on this point.)<p>Moreover, many blacks admitted to Ivy League schools aren&#x27;t black Americans at all--they are Africans, and their scores are on par with Asian students. People like the &quot;Tiger Mom&quot; acknowledge this openly. But educational institutions lump all blacks into the same statistical category--in part because as soon as it becomes evident that some black Americans are getting left behind in favor of Africans, the institutions will have to deal with various groups on that issue.<p>Ultimately, you fail to differentiate between black students, assuming they are all of one type--and yet you tout your intelligence! Besides, it&#x27;s hardly surprising that African students fare better in education than Black Americans. Most African students are from an environment where they are viewed as leaders, as equals, and not as inferiors. They see themselves reflected positively for most of their lives. Contrast that with how Black Americans are treated, and it&#x27;s no surprise that Africans fare better.<p>Not to mention that among black Americans at Ivy League schools, many get their admission boost from legacy admissions and their family&#x27;s wealth--they don&#x27;t even need to benefit affirmative action. Grades just okay but Dad gives enough money to the school? Take a trip to Europe for a year, write about it and come back next year--that&#x27;s for wealthy kids, regardless of race.<p>And, finally, just because any racial group has an &quot;average&quot; GPA or LSAT score, doesn&#x27;t mean that every student in the group does. Drop the pretense: some Asians and whites with lower test scores benefit from affirmative action just like other minorities.",1431795242

Useful to see if some categories are getting more traffic than others, so that we can re-balance if, for example, we think that Privacy is not getting the attention we want it to.<p>- See how long people are staying on this page. What if the writing or infographic don&#x27;t make sense to users? We can try and improve them so that users come away with a better understanding of privacy.<p>- How are users interacting with those circles? If they&#x27;re not hovering over any of the circles, maybe we should make it auto-switch between them to draw the user&#x27;s eye over. Or maybe if they&#x27;re only hovering over the first three, we should make those first three the most important aspects of privacy to make sure they&#x27;re seen.<p>The goal of Shape of the Web is (in my eyes) to educate users about the issues that the open internet faces today, and to help give them a framework for thinking about what the web is (it&#x27;s hard to think about a thing if you don&#x27;t know how it&#x27;s &quot;shaped&quot;).

What you write about banks is a common, but incorrect misconception about what banks do.<p>The truth of the matter is: <i>Banks do not need deposits to make loans.</i><p>Quite the contrary: Banks make loaning decisions independent of the level of their deposits - and it is the loan that causes the deposit, rather than the other way around, because the money loaned by the bank eventually lands in somebody&#x27;s deposit.<p>Think about it this way: A bank cannot force anybody to take out a loan. Instead, there is a demand for loans which banks satisfy (subject to checks of creditworthiness and available collateral). Whether person A spends $10 or puts it in a deposit does not change person B&#x27;s demand for credit,[1] and therefore the amount lent by banks does not change either.<p>[1] Of course, this is not entirely true. There can be causal links, but their direction is totally uncertain. For example, person A deciding <i>not</i> to spend money could mean that person B&#x27;s business begins to struggle and person B needs to take out a loan that they otherwise would not have had to take. In that case, saving does increase the level of loans, but in a way that most people would judge to be detrimental to the economy.<p>Conversely, person A deciding to <i>spend</i> the money could lead to person B&#x27;s business projecting growth, which encourages person B to invest by taking out a loan.

I&#x27;ve thought about this a lot, just because the UX of now cheap older cameras tends to be very good, for me at least, and the UX of the low end digital tends to be very eh. > $1000 bodies, it&#x27;s a different story of course. It isn&#x27;t exactly clear what I meant by UX; With my Minolta SRT 201, I can see Aperture and Shutter speed at a glance, modify them with a quick, dedicated, dial twist, have a distance scale on the lens, and look through a large, somewhat bright viewfinder (Later Minolta viewfinders are noticeably brighter though). The mirrorless experience on the low end really can&#x27;t compete. Cheap DSLRs are closer, but with shit viewfinders, and I hate the Canon top screen/dial system, and harder to adapt old lenses.<p>This means you can use the Shutter speed dial, the combo shutter button is a good idea that I did not think of at all (I always was thinking you&#x27;d use two buttons, one to put the digital side in BULB, then the actual shutter, cause I&#x27;m dumb). On the other hand, if I had a functional NEX-5, I don&#x27;t think I would have the heart to do it, and 38mm is maybe a little long for m4/3 general purpose.

Because they are accepting students with test scores WAY below those of the superior test scores of the asian pacific islander visual demographic. In that way they are being discriminatory, in other words, they don&#x27;t want too many asians around and they have a certain look for the school they wish to achieve or maintain. So racism. People these days aren&#x27;t used to hearing about Asian discrimination because black discrimination is thrown in our face so much it&#x27;s almost fatiguing.<p>This instance is very much a first world problem (I couldn&#x27;t get into harvard because I&#x27;m asian, but that white or black person did even though they scored lower.) but it&#x27;s one we have proof of and it&#x27;s very much worth fixing to set an example everywhere.<p>You read harvard&#x27;s reply or reasoning that what they do is ok. Actually depending how you interpret it it could be a complaint by harvard. They said are following STATE Law.  Maybe, if we interpret what they said another way, we learn they don&#x27;t like doing things that way and really shouldn&#x27;t be held accountable for any so called legal discrimination because they are following the law. Maybe harvard wants us to blame the law and not them. Maybe harvard would like to bring on more asians or more whites but can&#x27;t even though they perform better and do more research.<p>Any attempt for harvard or any other school to bring up the holistic student argument is ridiculous. Because Asian students very much participate in extracurricular activities here and in asian countries, objectively so. You won&#x27;t see a lot on the football or basketball team. You will see a lot of them in other things sports and clubs of all kinds.<p>Also what do you mean to affirmative action will &quot;correct&quot; society?  In what interpretation is a society &quot;corrected&quot; if as you said races are a fiction in your mind?  If there&#x27;s no race, then there&#x27;s no racism, it&#x27;s just a bunch of people interacting with a bunch of other people of various colors and any &quot;trends&quot; are meaningless.<p>You can&#x27;t have it both ways. You can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s a fiction but then wish that any places you go was would be more &quot;correct&quot; if it were more color diverse, (tossing out all concept of people&#x27;s personal choice or their capabilities.)<p>Races do exist because groups of people evolved based on their environments and their ancestors ability to procreate. We may not know exactly why because people move and separate and that long span of time has no written record really. But we do know people look different, their languages are different behaviors however &quot;anecdotally&quot; are often different. Their prevalence of various conditions, disease and health are different. Artifacts were different too. Their capabilities on tests across the world are clearly different.<p>And if various experiments weren&#x27;t shunned we&#x27;d likely understand more about race. They acquired various levels of intelligence and physique due to conditions. The problem is a lot of these things that make people different aren&#x27;t studied enough. Because universities fear their reputation because even true scientific findings can and have been hidden due to political implications. Thankfully learning about the brain and understanding people are sciences that won&#x27;t be stopped. So we&#x27;ll probably learn more over time about race.

You&#x27;re describing real things.<p>A lot of people are still in denial about the fact that our industry has become populated in recent years by the sorts of high-powered uber-alpha sociopaths that dominate finance.<p>Only 20 years ago -- maybe less -- computing still had a &quot;hobbyist and hacker&quot; feel. People were making money, sure, but it wasn&#x27;t a place where people go to become instant millionaires or billionaires. Finance and high corporate MBA stuff was where you went to do that.<p>Now that&#x27;s changed. An app can make a fortune, quite literally. So now our industry is attracting an increasing number of &quot;wolf of Wall St.&quot; types.<p>Nerds and old school hackers just don&#x27;t know how to deal with this personality type, and many deny its existence outright. It&#x27;s tough to even describe to someone who hasn&#x27;t encountered it in its natural habitat. I also think people deny its existence because they want to believe in a rational, meritocratic world, not an irrational emotionally-driven shitshow like the real world we actually live in.<p>It&#x27;s really nasty because our industry is not hardened against this stuff. In a way, those folks are less destructive in finance because the financial scene expects, understands, and knows how to deal with them. Your typical mildly Aspergers-ey nerd is fresh meat, and our industry&#x27;s institutions aren&#x27;t &quot;psychopath-hardened&quot; either.<p>I&#x27;ve been in a good number of VC pitches and have met many. They are not all bad people by any means, nor do they tend to be dumb. A few of them are &quot;wolf of Wall St.&quot; types, but the negative dynamic I see more often is someone who <i>wants</i> to be this type but really isn&#x27;t. This leads to what you humorously call &quot;chicken hawking,&quot; and also to cases where VC types can themselves be taken for a ride by these predators. When you encounter a true high-powered psychopath, it&#x27;s really dangerous not to treat them like a rabid mountain lion. Any affinity you might have, or naivete, or desire to live vicariously in some way through them is something they can &quot;use.&quot;<p>I actually don&#x27;t blame people too terribly much for sort of wanting to be one of these predators... our culture glorifies it. How many movies do we have about the happy go lucky cop who blows people away and makes jokes, or the glamorous con man who pulls off the big heist, or the endearing mobster?

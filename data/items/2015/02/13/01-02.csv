9042468,comment,9042466,9042466,0,0,vincelieu,,,"Hello friends!<p>I want to introduce ShredReel to you all which just went live a few weeks ago. ShredReel is a collaborative platform for organizing, finding, and sharing videos from the ski slopes.<p>ShredReel allows you to upload unedited videos from any camera (GoPros, smartphones, point & shoots) and tag friends, tricks, locations, bloopers, basically anything done on skis or a snowboard using a vast set of pre-defined tags. You can also search and filter by any of those tags so it’s easy to find videos featuring specific actions or at specific locations. It allows you to perform cross-sectional searches of different tags (basically like a pivot table (for my Excel nerds) for videos). This is actually why the site was created - it is very difficult to find videos of specific actions since you are at the mercy of the person titling the video.<p>Lets say you did a 360 rotation on skis, you would add the tag for a 360, but if you didn&#x27;t land it, you could also add the tag for bloopers. If you also did a a grab, you can add a tag for a grab as well. That moment will then show up on all searches for 360s, bloopers, and grabs. The best section will most likely be the bloopers as I&#x27;m sure you can imagine.<p>We are still trying to get more content up there so pardon the fact that videos are sparse. I would love any feedback this talented community has to offer!<p>Hope you enjoy it!\nThanks!",1423792591

9042452,comment,9042149,9042408,0,0,Zephyr314,,,"Thanks!<p>1. The more dimensions in your parameter space the longer it will take to find an optima in general. Something like grid search is exponential in the number of dimensions while we find that in practice our methods are closer to linear (something around 2D - 10D, where D is the number of dimensions). While there is no explicit &quot;limit&quot; to the number of parameters (in the code or algorithm) we tend to see the best results when they are < 20 as Peter Frazier suggests as it allows us to find an optima much quicker (in the number of samples).<p>2. You provide a single metric (Overall Evaluation Criterion) to SigOpt, this can be a combination of many sub-objectives. We talked a little about this in the MOE docs [1] and are happy to help people brainstorm on the best objectives. This is a very important part of the process as Microsoft points out in a recent paper (section 3.1) [2].<p>3. We can give you back experimental designs with n>1 points. We condition on any outstanding experiments being run too. Some of this work was developed in my thesis [3]. We have some docs on this too [4].<p>4. We do support the notion of &quot;untunable&quot; parameters in beta (releasing soon). In a given experiment if you know you need to use a specific chemical we can hold that constant while optimizing the other free parameters so that you can run a single batch with that specific constraint (or a set of constraints). I think this covers what you are asking, but I am happy to dive deeper if not. I&#x27;d be happy to help you set up one of these experiments if you are curious.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://yelp.github.io/MOE/objective_functions.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://yelp.github.io/MOE/objective_functions.html</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://www.exp-platform.com/documents/puzzlingoutcomesincontrolledexperiments.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.exp-platform.com/documents/puzzlingoutcomesincont...</a><p>[3]: <a href=""https://github.com/sc932/Thesis/blob/master/ScottClark_thesis.pdf?raw=true"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/sc932/Thesis/blob/master/ScottClark_thesi...</a><p>[4]: <a href=""https://sigopt.com/docs/overview/parallel"" rel=""nofollow"">https://sigopt.com/docs/overview/parallel</a>",1423792242

It does not, and you are correct to point out that there is a big difference.  What I meant is than in many areas of the law, you are literally not a legal person if you are not on the koseki.  They just have no way of dealing with you.  Family law is the most obvious place where this occurs, but there are some others a well.  Basically, if the law is written to look at the juuminhyou (essentially your registered address), then as a foreigner you are good to go.  If it is writen to look at the koseki, unless you are married, you are going to hit a brick wall.  Unless, the law has changed very recently (and I know that they were planning to change it), the example I gave (custody in divorce) is a classic example.  There is no way that a Japanese judge can grant custody of children to someone who is not on a koseki somewhere because it is legally impossible to do so.  Where I was wrong was to say that this is a right.  It is not a right (and as a foreigner living in any country you have to get used to the fact that you have a lot less rights than a citizen).  It is a consequence of the way the law is written.  Still, I can tell you that the difference between when I was living in Japan before I had my name on that piece of paper and after is quite large.

9042358,comment,9034884,9041606,0,0,bobwaycott,,,"Again, your understanding of Marxist political theory is grossly inaccurate. This is [still] the mythical version of Marxism that was parroted by Soviets, [at least some] Chinese, and Western powers for their own ends--be it masquerading as &quot;true&quot; Marxists, or scaring the shit out of people into seeing Marxism/socialism/communism, instead of its authoritarian practitioners, as &quot;evil&quot;. You also appear to misunderstand entirely Marx&#x27;s conception of the dictatorship of the proletariat. It was in no way authoritarian in any of Marx&#x27;s explications of the idea.<p>Marx was--in his political theory, as well as his political activity--focused on defending and advancing the idea of <i>democratic authority of the general interests of the masses</i>. He did not, unlike Bakunin and others, view the masses as mere cannon fodder--<i>Bakunin actually called them this</i>--to throw at standing power to succeed in revolutionary overthrow. Moreover, Marx ardently and unfailingly argued and advocated that the ultimate end, with regard to the masses, was to teach them to walk by themselves, eschewing the bureaucratic regulation through which they are taught from childhood onward to believe in and acquiesce to the authority of those set over them. Workers are to engage the process of self-emancipation through taking charge of and reorganizing society--through bottom-up democratic means. Bakunin and others, on the other hand, argued that teaching the people anything was stupid, and they should merely be convinced to revolt. To this, Marx once wrote that inciting workers without offering them any guiding ideas or constructive self-emancipatory doctrine was &quot;equivalent to vain dishonest play at preaching which assumes an inspired prophet on the one side and on the other only the gaping asses.&quot;[1]<p>Writing during his time of participating in the International, Marx believed it “the business of the International Working Men’s Association to combine and generalize the <i>spontaneous movements</i> of the working classes, but not to dictate or impose any doctrinary system whatever.”[2] He vehemently opposed the moves by Bakunin and others to create secretive, autonomous groups within the International, because such a group “is opposed to the development of the proletarian movement because, instead of instructing the workers, these societies subject them to authoritarian, mystical laws which cramp their independence and distort their powers of reason.”[3] Marx explained to Wilhelm Blos that when he and Engels joined the Communist League, they “did so only on condition that anything conducive to a superstitious belief in authority be eliminated from the Rules.”[4]<p>The dictatorship of the proletariat is a bottom-up democratic seizure of power. Marx did not have any problem playing politics. He just wanted to see the workers in control of politics, instead of it residing in the hands of capitalists and their elitist servants who would use political power to perpetuate the alienation and division of workers, thus preserving the privileged status of those with capital within the social and political system. Of course, this is also heavily integrated with taking control of the means of production and placing it into the hands of the working masses, as <i>tarentel</i> mentions in a sibling comment. Nevertheless, you are imbuing Marx&#x27;s notion of &quot;dictatorship of the proletariat&quot; with post-Marx, 20th-century infused notions of dictatorship--that is, authoritarian rule of one (or few) over all.<p>Feel free to say if you are still convinced of the rightness of your inaccurate understanding and I will offer more explanation.<p>[EDIT]: For full disclosure, the particular arc and inclusion of quoted items 2-4 is borrowed from David Adam&#x27;s &quot;Marx, Bakunin, and the question of authoritarianism&quot;[5]. It got directly to the bits I wanted to cover, and saved me the time of having to comb back through my own library to find the relevant quotes I was looking for.<p>[1]: Francis Wheen&#x27;s <i>Karl Marx: A Life</i>, 104.<p>[2]: Marx&#x27;s &quot;Instructions for Delegates to the Geneva Congress&quot; in <i>Political Writings Vol 3</i>, 90.<p>[3]: Marx&#x27;s &quot;Speech on Secret Societies&quot; from <i>Collected Works Vol 22</i>, 621.<p>[4]: Marx to Blos in <i>Collected Works Vol 45</i>, 288.<p>[5]: <a href=""http://libcom.org/library/marx-bakunin-question-authoritarianism"" rel=""nofollow"">http://libcom.org/library/marx-bakunin-question-authoritaria...</a>",1423790479

However I am not a lawyer nor am I hugely aware of the nuances of the issues, so take this with a grain of salt.<p>Basically the law firm in question is using lawsuits as a method of social activism to compel large orgs to adhere to the ADA.  (Similar thing happened to Scribd.)  Basically deaf/blind nonprofits ask these entities in question for open accessibility accommodations and typically do NOT get denied the request, but this ends up being a low-priority task that gets tabled for years.  Unfortunately between asking nicely, mobilizing social support to effect change, and lawsuits, the legal stick is by-and-large most effective at making things happen.<p>This is also NOT a shakedown; the end goal is NOT that lawyers or plaintiffs get fat stacks of cash, but that these accommodations be implemented.  To the disabilities orgs, these requests are similar to asking for accessibility ramps and what not.",1423789473

We get sad and troubled when we shouldn&#x27;t. We experience intense pain with no way to shut it off.

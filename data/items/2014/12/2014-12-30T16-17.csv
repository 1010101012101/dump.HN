The only one that hasn&#x27;t bit me in the ass is string in Go; the approach they take is a sequence of bytes, utf8 encoded by convention (which is easy to follow); there are methods to work with unicode code points when you need to, otherwise it&#x27;s just bytes. It&#x27;s simple, well-defined, non-magic, and doesn&#x27;t screw you over.",1419958783

I&#x27;m not certain what that something would have been, but Mr. Entropy suggests that a destructive device was more likely than a constructive one.<p>Granted, he was working off of principles already explored and established by Manhattan and other nuclear physics research, but it is still possible that he would have created something novel before killing himself, and possibly others, simply because externally funded researchers must necessarily be prudent and rational to secure external research funding, and therefore don&#x27;t intentionally try anything too far beyond the ordinary.<p>Crackpots, on the other hand, can do whatever crazy thing they can imagine with their own money.  The only thing really stopping a tinkerer&#x27;s nuke is poor availability of appropriate isotopes.  And David Hahn began construction of a breeder reactor in his own backyard.  At age 17.<p>The &quot;demon core&quot; accidentally went critical twice, killing the person closest to it within a month, both times.  In both cases, that person had the presence of mind to remove the neutron reflectors as quickly as they were able.  An amateur, acting alone, might have accidentally caused a criticality event large enough to qualify as &quot;the first nuclear bomb&quot;.<p>Manhattan was more about adapting nuclear bombs for military use.  It&#x27;s really easy to create a bomb if you don&#x27;t care about blowing yourself up (see also: &quot;Things I Won&#x27;t Work With&quot; blog), but much more difficult to destroy only what you want to destroy, without dying yourself or going bankrupt.",1419958768

Even gregarious extroverts will be quiet in a library like atmosphere, and move their conversations to a kitchen or break out room<p>The open office allows people to split into sub teams and to work together on projects more fluidly than an arrangement where people have strong physical barriers to moving.<p>But it&#x27;s a sort of environment that comes together as the sum of its parts.

I have state farm, and my wife and I have our laptops under personal article policies.  The coverage is better, broader, and cheaper that anything else I&#x27;ve seen.  My wife recently got a surface pro 3 to use during her forest soils PhD, and I was adamant we get nice insurance if she was going to be using it in the field.  Two years of no deductible spill, drop, and malfunction coverage through squarespace is 280$.  I get the same coverage plus theft and loss for 40 a year through my insurer.  And it is a 3 block walk to the office where I can eat pastries and drink coffee while I file a claim.  I have only had to file one claim, but it was for a head crash and they covered a new hard drive w/out question.<p>I&#x27;m not saying it is a good fit for everyone, but it works out well for me.

You can try to answer specific questions without suspicion of guilt. This is what is happening. They are answering specific questions, but they don&#x27;t have suspicion of guilt.<p>An alternative is to get a warrant on the &#x27;known terrorists&#x27; (which in practice is used very rarely for &#x27;terrorist&#x27; and very often for other interests) and see directly who they have been contacting without having to see that I called my my babysitter and you called your attorney in the meantime.

I suggest rereading your comment.<p>> This isn&#x27;t law enforcement, it&#x27;s foreign intelligence.<p>It&#x27;s foreign intelligence that is collecting vast swaths of information on American people. This information can be used to investigate Americans without going through normal investigative channels. It is law enforcement, though you can mince words. If you prefer we can call it foreign intelligence so long as we remind ourselves that it is principally different than how foreign intelligence is supposed to work in the United States.<p>> There&#x27;s nothing in the PCLOB report that says that. The report makes it pretty clear that the whole three hop process pertains to phone records.<p>Perhaps I&#x27;ve confused PCLOB revealed information with the technical information revealed in Snowden documents then? I fear we&#x27;ll need to drag out technical documents to resolve this specific dispute. But even if you <i>don&#x27;t</i> take the other networks into account three hops is still <i>huge</i>, especially with a large number of targets. It is gross overcollection without selectors.<p>> It&#x27;s inaccurate because he states that the NSA can hand attorney-client communications over to federal prosecutors, when the document he&#x27;s citing says the exact opposite.<p>Perhaps he should have said attorneys? Were it destined for prosecutors, the intelligence will make its way to prosecutors later (when and if there is a trial).<p>> How could it be parallel construction if the person is already indicted?<p>Because parallel construction can be done to collect evidence and because the gathered intelligence can be used in the indictment of other targets - and here the source of the intelligence used to do this remains undisclosed. And because communications (as written below) contain records from before an indictment, which will contain lots of information useful to get an indictment and lots of useful information to a prosecution after an indictment.<p>Also we should note that the NSA only marks attorney-client communications a no-go after there has been an indictment:  attorney-client communications are a confidential and privileged communication whether you are on trial, expect to be indicted, or are talking to your attorney about what you should do to avoid legal trouble because of what your peers are engaged in.<p>> if the purpose was to feed intelligence to US law enforcement by circumventing client-attorney privilege, why would they put in those additional restrictions?<p>If we grant that &#x27;the purpose was to...&#x27; then the answer is: to comply with - or to appear to comply with - the law of the land in the most minimal way.<p>But we should be careful.

Imagine if half of the people who bought tickets on A->B->C flight decided to stay in B->C. They leave the airline in a position where they can&#x27;t resell the empty seats, so the jet flies half-full while still using the pretty much the same amount of fuel (the impact of passengers is marginal). If you scale this behaviour up, an airline ends up flying 2x as many B->C flights as needed, thus literally wasting half of the fuel on that route.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s very ethical to deliberately introduce inefficiencies to a system for personal gain, especially if it leads to wasting scarce resources. Being a responsible human being means caring about other things than just money.<p>Also, it&#x27;s hard for me to feel compassion for passengers exploiting this trick - air travel is totally underpriced already, casual passengers pay much less than they should actually pay to cover the operating costs (not to mention externalities). People complain about algorithmic pricing, but that actually makes air travel affordable for a typical person, where a fixed pricing scheme would not.",1419957813

While the tooling is still not as nice as Clojure-on-the-JVM in my opinion, it continues to get better everyday--this week support for a better REPL via NodeJS[1] was introduced, for instance. A lot of smart people are putting good effort into the compiler and ecosystem and I suspect we&#x27;ll see a continued uptrend in cljs adoption. Anyway, it may be just what you want: an elegant, productive, pragmatic language with first-class support for concurrency (atoms, core.async) and well-suited to short-lived and scripting-domain problems.

There&#x27;s a great recent post by Jeffrey Ventrella on &quot;Slow Programming&quot;[1] highlighting the problem that comes from the &quot;fallacy that all engineers are fungible&quot;[2] and throwing a bunch of programmers immediately into an iterative development cycle without proper up-front planning.<p>I think it&#x27;s important to note that big reformations, like Agile replacing Waterfall, are reactionary; by necessity they tend to be <i>overly</i> so; to promote change they demonize the old way. Unfortunately there&#x27;s usually a core of good ideas that get thrown out as well.<p>I don&#x27;t think the Waterfall methodology works for most products, but it made up-front planning and careful consideration part of the design process that&#x27;s missing in a lot of projects today. I think a balanced approach is needed; just enough up front planning to provide a strong, clear vision to the team, consideration for the tools and processes that will be used to get there, and someone with the vision and technical knowledge to lead it. These are some of the points I like to hammer out before launching into a project:<p><pre><code>  * Design - what is the product supposed to look like?
  * Testability - how do you intend to test your code?
  * Documentation - how will the code, product be documented?
  * Tooling - what&#x27;s your preferred dev tool chain?
  * Code architecture - What&#x27;s your design philosophy?
  * Prototyping - straight to product or prototype first?
  * Delegation - how to structure for future delegation?
  * Security - how to audit the security of your app?
</code></pre>
These points often seem to get left as an afterthought, but these broad strokes have worked pretty well for me and still allow for iterative development and functional refinement.<p><pre><code>  1. http://ventrellathing.wordpress.com/2013/06/18/the-case-for-slow-programming/

Which librairies should you pick to get started?&quot;<p>Who cares. What&#x27;s stopping anyone from just writing a JS file and adding a script tag to their html, that&#x27;s how most of us learned it.<p>&quot;There is, however, a price to pay to the approach of coding through instant gratification.&quot;<p>No there&#x27;s not. It just depends on what type of coder you are. I like to think a problem through BEFORE coding and then hack, when I come to another problem I pause, think, solve the problem, (all away from the computer) then want to code super fast again. Anything that
makes the &quot;turn my idea/algorithm&quot; into running code faster is good, when writing C/C++ anyone will tell you they hate
compiling, why? because its slows down the &quot;idea-to-code&quot; part. To the authors credit he seems to prefer this approach as
well, it just doesn&#x27;t follow that you have to hack super fast all the time and never think just because you don&#x27;t have to
wait for code to compile.<p>&quot;The hardest thing in Javascript development today is maybe less the development itself than knowing which libraries to pick.&quot;<p>That&#x27;s a problem?

If you can&#x27;t find what you want, build it yourself, maintain it, and use it. Everyone does
this in any other language and it works fine, its also working for JS too. see here: <a href=""https://github.com/sorrycc/awesome-javascript"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/sorrycc/awesome-javascript</a><p>The only thing I would agree with is that yes, it is ridiculously easy to publish something to npm so there is a lot of garbage.

Smaller scope issues should be easier and they would give you some more experience in reading code which would appear to be the issue at hand.<p>For the larger codebases, generally you would want to get a vague idea of the architecture and then blind yourself to most of the complexity.
Let&#x27;s say that you wanted to work on a network based data serialization library and the issue marked out as &#x27;contributor friendly&#x27; was adding unsigned integer support building off existing signed integer support.
For that target, there&#x27;s a large portion of the code that you shouldn&#x27;t need to understand too deeply and there&#x27;s a section that is going to be relevant to making the modification.
Try to find the code that is relevant and trace the execution just by reading the code.<p>As long as you limit the scope of your work and the codebase is somewhat compartmentalized, you can shrink the time it takes to go through large projects by a fairly large amount.",1419955847

Some(Result) can make nil go away, but you&#x27;ve still got the error to deal with.  So you&#x27;re talking some type system where a single value encapsulates Result/Nil/Error?",1419955224

Here&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve experienced:<p>I moved from California to Calgary, Canada in April of this year. In California I called myself a consultant and everything was cool. Moving to Calgary, where Oil and Gas dominates the marketplace and so do the scummy Entperise Consultants it seems the title of consultant rubbed people the wrong way, given I&#x27;m trying to do work in Ruby.<p>I recently went back from referring to myself as a Consultant to Freelancer in my conversations and I&#x27;ve had much better conversations with people. I also can speak more confidently in myself calling myself a freelancer. Consultant has always felt really cheesy and if I don&#x27;t feel comfortable saying it, then I won&#x27;t sell it very well.<p>Long story shory: Go with what you truly believe in and your ideal clients are receptive to. In my experience, small to medium sized clients are far more receptive to &quot;Freelancer&quot; than &quot;Consultant.&quot; YMMV.",1419955216

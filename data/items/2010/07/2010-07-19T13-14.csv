I got totally overwhelmed by the sum and quantity of knowledge to absorb, and by the fact that finding libraries to do ""fun"" things was very difficult.<p>Then i tried clojure (with netbeans which has at the time quite a easy IDE integration that allowed me to not focus too much on the java side of things, unlike using clojure on the command line was at the time). I used it first to solve some project Eulers problems, and then began toying with some libs, notably QT Jambi, swing, compojure, etc. All this to say that learning it was a lot easier than learning Common Lisp, because at the time i began, it was a lot simpler language than Common Lisp. It still is, but i wonder if the protocols thing is not gonna considerably complicate a noob's approach to the language.<p>My advice to clojure newbies is, start with an IDE that makes it easy to interact with libraries and let you concentrate on the code, not on the ugly java stuff. You will have plenty of time to handle that later on if you really enjoy clojure ;)",1279547110

It's been about 4 years since I last did something like this, but the general process was something like:<p>1) Design and model rough prototype.  This was my own time/effort and about $500 in materials (for a custom server bezel).<p>2) Take model to a local machinist/engineer to have CAD work done and produce initial prototypes on a Haas mill - $5000<p>3) Take CAD drawings and such to local low-volume production house to have initial small run of units made, at a cost of ~$250/ea.<p>4) (I never actually got to this stage in this project).  After stage 3, you'd generally do a field test looking for whatever properties you did or did not expect from the case.  Does it stay on, does it wear/damage the phone, does it survive a drop, does it affect the signal, etc.  From here you'd likely have CAD work done for a mold ($5,000 - $10,000, IME) and have an actual mold made ($10,000- $100,000, IME)  Depending on complexity, number of parts, tolerance, etc., this can vary widely.  Once all this is done, it's usually $1-$3/unit in volume (10,000 +), but again all this varies widely on a number of factors.<p>Very generally speaking, you're talking about probably a $30K <i>minimum</i> investment to get your first 1,000 or so unit.

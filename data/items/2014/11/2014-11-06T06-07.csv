You use them against <i>volatile</i> media in a physical attack in an attempt to sneak under/manipulate the limits of that volatility to cause violations of security assumptions, such as &quot;the keys are in RAM&quot; (true) > &quot;RAM is instantly volatile on shutdown&quot; (not quite true) > &quot;keys are instantly zeroised on shutdown&quot; (not this easily they&#x27;re not).<p>Some RAM is <i>much</i> more volatile than conventional bulk SRAM or DRAM (for example, frequently L1/L2 caches on CPUs are impractical to exploit). Properly encrypt bulk data held in high-remenance or non-volatile RAM with a key held in such low-remanance RAM, and your security problem is solved.",1415257125

If there were no price discrimination then the theatre would make more money charging £7 to all 20 adults and 10 students (£210) than charging £10 to only the 20 adults (£200) and having ten empty seats.<p>No, I&#x27;m not.  For one thing, I picked £7 out of thin air.  Change it to £6 and this (erroneous anyhow) statement falls apart.  Moreover your analysis is wrong - not everyone is as happy as they could be, you&#x27;re only thinking from the consumer&#x27;s perspective.  The cinema <i>could</i> have made £7 * 10 + £10 * 20 = £270 so in your &quot;best&quot; case for everyone, the cinema is actually £60 short of their best scenario.  The 20 adults were willing to spend £10 each, so their arbitrary £3 bonus that they didn&#x27;t actually demand is optimal based on what?  Consumers being less evil than companies?  Give me a break.<p>> if the market has vigorous competition then engaging in price discrimination will only drive the customers being discriminated against to your competitors.<p>It is not <i>discrimination</i> in the political sense, but the dictionary sense: to differentiate.  Price discrimination in theory should not drive customers anywhere but rather make them indifferent to their choice of supplier.",1415256542

Mental illness is not compatible with doing a start up).<p>Rather Than governmental Democracy.  Have a system where people can communicate information and ideas to large non-governmental entities.<p>Run a tree of delegates who feed information based upon its quality up to a higher level.  Anyone may listen to anyone and speak to anyone but you can also  choose to ignore anyone.  You choose delegates for each individual case by picking someone receptive to your comment.  People higher up the tree will generally only listen to people they know and trust.<p>This system would provide a useful middle ground to the current situation that people find themselves in when they need to communicate.  Their main point of contact are automated systems or de-facto automated humans following processes.   To get action on some significant issues,  you need to win the publicity lottery and have you case become virally popular to the point where someone who can actually help makes contact.<p>It isn&#x27;t as ambitious as running a government, but would serve a real need.  As an example of the sort of thing where this may help, there have been numerous instances of Obvious Malware on the Google Play store that have managed to acquire a significant number of downloads.  When these instances have been noticed and appear on reddit /r/android, they are swiftly removed from the store.   I&#x27;m sure similar instances have happened where a company has taken the action they needed to take only after the problem has reached the front page of HN.  Rather than having to make a big public noise (which only really works for a few), people should have an avenue to get information where it is needed.<p>As a business model I would aim to have companies pay to have their top tiers of the tree managed by full-time staff.",1415256078

The author buys into Wiki-utopianism -- the idea that Wikipedia could somehow become &quot;the sum of all human knowledge&quot;.

The number of administrators is dropping and soon there won&#x27;t be enough administrators to maintain the pages. [1] There is no plan from the Wikimedia Foundation to deal with further loss of administrators.

The article claims that &quot;Everyone can participate and every voice is heard&quot; but that&#x27;s clearly not true.

Excluding women and minorities is hardly, as the article says, &quot; a radically participatory model for this technologic age&quot;<p>It&#x27;s no secret that Wikipedia&#x27;s content creation process is one of the most toxic out there.

Despite a lot of talking about &quot;inclusion&quot; and &quot;diversity,&quot; nothing will ever be fixed, because the core feature of wiki software is &quot;content through conflict&quot;.<p>As someone who runs a crowdsourced content site not that dissimilar to Wikipedia, but that has 80% female and minority participation, I have come to realize that the wiki software itself is the problem, attracting young men who are willing to fight for their knowledge to be displayed on the site. But the intensity of that fighting excludes many others. Much of the discussion about why women and minorities don&#x27;t participate is like the lions at the watering hole wondering why the zebras aren&#x27;t thirsty.<p>[1]<a href=""http://wikipediocracy.com/wiki/index.php?title=Wikipedia%27s_%27death_spiral%27"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wikipediocracy.com/wiki/index.php?title=Wikipedia%27s...</a>",1415255445

Let&#x27;s take a look at the capital expenses: setting up some re-targeted advertisements isn&#x27;t very expensive at all, and giving away a thousand rides at an average ride-cost of, let&#x27;s say, $25, is only a $25k expenditure.<p>To recruit drivers (maybe in more than one city) might be a little expensive, just in terms of a time cost. If you&#x27;re paying recruiters, that might cost a month or two of salary for every city you&#x27;re launching in. Alternatively, some of these employees might just take an equity share in your startup.<p>The last big part is the design of an app: this could take a handful of competent engineers perhaps one or two months. This might be your biggest expenditure (a team of 10 might cost you $100k/month), but it might also be possible to pay them (partially) with equity.<p>I would wager that you could start up a competitor regionally (or perhaps even in a small number of cities) for less than $1M, which is a modest amount in the current tech. climate (specifically w/r/t/ venture capital). Especially considering the potential returns, it seems likely that some entrepreneurs will go for this.<p>And concerning regional competitors: yes, certainly.

Again: they get the product they wanted and you get profit you couldn&#x27;t have had any other way, and everyone&#x27;s as happy as they can be.<p>This is where you&#x27;re wrong. Not everyone is as happy as they could be. If there were no price discrimination then the theatre would make more money charging £7 to all 20 adults and 10 students (£210) than charging £10 to only the 20 adults (£200) and having ten empty seats. In consequence the adults are worse off to the tune of £3 than they would be in the absence of price discrimination.<p>The good that price discrimination is theoretically supposed to do is where e.g. it costs $10 to make a widget and most customers are willing to pay $50 but a small minority are only willing to pay $12. Obviously if the seller has to pick one price it will be $50 and the $12 customers are out of luck.<p>The problem with this is that it assumes either a monopolistic seller or explicit or implicit collusion between sellers. Because if the market has vigorous competition then engaging in price discrimination will only drive the customers being discriminated against to your competitors.<p>So if you think you&#x27;ve found a situation where price discrimination would be a good thing, what you&#x27;ve really found is a situation where antitrust enforcement would be a good thing.",1415253785

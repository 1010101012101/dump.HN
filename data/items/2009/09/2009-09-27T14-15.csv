Our entire industry, this ""Information Technology"" thing, is fundamentally about making things that allow people to not work hard. Technology is about being lazy, about avoiding effort where effort is not necessary.<p>Using index cards and typewriters to compose documents is certainly harder work than using a word processor application on a PC. Nobody would ever say there was greater merit in the old way (well, nobody worth paying attention to). It's the distinction between ""working hard"" and ""working smart.""<p>So ""hard work"" in the classical sense seems to mean ""sit down, head down, move the pencil, move the pencil, move the pencil."" That's toiling. That's <i>not</i> thinking of more efficient ways to ""move the pencil"". Working hard is a productivity enhancer, but only in a linear fashion. Technology is a productivity multiplier.<p>I refer you to the Robert Heinlein short-story ""The Tale of the Man Who Was Too Lazy to Fail,"" which is provided in his magnum opus ""Time Enough for Love"". We should be ""working hard"" on finding ways to be lazy. It's through the pursuit of technologies that allow us to be as productive as we are on less effort that make the big advances in productivity, not ""working hard"".",1254063547
846893,comment,846518,846518,0,0,camccann,,,"Okay, so holding to uncompromising moral principles isn't particularly compatible with real-world success. This is neither new nor limited to Free Software; you either compromise in order to get along, or you retreat with like-minded folks and live your own way (cf. Amish communities, hippie communes, &c.)<p>Not everyone agrees with Stallman's ethical standards, and it's not even hard to argue that strategic compromises could better achieve the long-term goals of the FSF (in fact, they've been known to make exactly those sorts of compromises).<p>But it really bothers me when people criticize Stallman for being out of touch, or imply that it's ""hatred of Microsoft"" or whatever motivating him, while sometimes seeming to promote compromise as a virtue in and of itself. Are these people willfully ignoring the explicit philosophical/ethical framework behind the FSF? Are they opposed to the ethical stance but unwilling to say so directly? Is it inconceivable to them that someone could actually dedicate their lives to a moral cause?<p>I suppose the obvious cynical answer is ""they're trolling GNU/Fanboys in order to rack up more website hits"", but I try not to assume acting in bad faith as my first explanation.",1254063543

846890,comment,846579,846876,0,0,Mz,,,"Serious question:  I am wondering if you aren't American.  American culture puts a lot of emphasis on ""work ethic"".  Someone in the comments section of the article indicated they were British but living in America and generally appalled at how we ""flog ourselves to death"" constantly.  Perhaps this observation is more ""obvious"" to people from other cultures?  But for most Americans it probably merits repeating (very regularly even).",1254062979

846879,comment,845938,845938,0,0,Mz,,,"Relatively new here.  I don't really recognize a lot of names and tend to pay less attention to names here than in other environments.  This is in part for reasons others have mentioned:  There are no avatars and there are no signature blocks.  The design here is more minimalist than anything else I have participated in.  I am still getting used to it and not really in a position to make a judgment call about whether the orange dot (lack of visible scores) is a ""good"" change or a ""bad"" one.  My general impression is that pecking order matters less here than on most discussion sites.  My general feeling is that is a good thing.  I hate the Lord of the Flies stuff that is so common in online groups.",1254062185

846876,comment,846579,846814,0,0,Ardit20,,,"It waters down the expectations that a writer should have of their readership however and the expectations that a reader should have of an article.<p>Personally I would not mind reading some of pg's articles as although some may contain obvious information, they usually have been thought through and synthesised to create new knowledge. This article however is simply stating the obvious as much as an article suggesting that you should eat everyday would be suggesting the obvious. I do not think it has escaped by anyone the fact that they need to work on the right thing, nor as the above comment suggests, that sometimes they may be 'traped' by focusing too much on a certain thing. If the article was about research findings on how to organise your time, how to manage tendencies towards perfection, how to recognise when you are spending time on something you should not, then perhaps the reader would have learned something. The article however is superficial and typical of a wider trend on the internet where opinions are the norm and currency rather than imparting knowledge on the readership.<p>Perhaps to suggest that what the article contains and the one who wrote it is dumb - within the confines of this specific article - might be perceived as derogatory and uncivilised, yet I do not think that one should refrain from speaking their mind. I found the article dumb, I could have said pointless, yet I thought dumb describes it better because it is so obvious, the title is misleading and hardly supported in the article and the article itself has not been thought through at all, let alone the title. If the writer wants me to hail her as a beacon of truth then she should try much harder rather than think that she is having a chat with her friend while drinking a coffee about what she thinks of hard work.",1254062013

Probes to Mars and Venus were deliberately sterilized before they landed. So far as I know that practice continues today.<p>The last thing you want to do to a planet that might contain life is to send living things from Earth to visit it. Their residue will screw up every experiment forever after. Even now, when all we send are sterilized robot probes, avoiding contamination by Earth-derived biomolecules is a major struggle.",1254061676

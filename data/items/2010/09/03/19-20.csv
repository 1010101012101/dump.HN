Apple can get product quality to the point they do because they laser focus on a few profitable segments. Microsoft's business model --- not ""what Steve Ballmer thinks they should be doing this month"" but their underlying business model --- involves them serving 80+% of the market.<p>This is sort of like complaining that Safeway can't make ice cream as well as Ben and Jerry's.",1283543906

It's easy to say XP is a good system <i>now</i> with the maturity of three service packs and the bad taste of Vista still in our mouths, but I remember all those years ago much dislike of XP around the internet. Among other things, it was a security nightmare that wasn't even fixed until SP2. You put release day XP on your machine and put it on the internet and you're machine will be probably hacked within the hour.<p>On the other hand not to many people stuck with Vista. A fully patched Vista installation works just fine nowadays. It still has higher system requirements, but those requirements are now 4 year old systems.",1283543786
1660894,comment,1660096,1660639,0,0,walkon,,,"I agree, when you consider when products were released and compare it to similar offerings at those times, many Microsoft products are (or were) ""decent"".  I would add these:<p>- Windows 95:  Not perfectly stable or technically very groundbreaking, but a good enough combination of usability and features to be considered decent in my mind and millions of others at the time.<p>- IE6: great at the time.  Some of the standards it doesn't support didn't exist when it came out.   Also, IE5 introduced the Microsoft.XMLHTTP ActiveX control, which was the foundation for XMLHttpRequest.   If that wasn’t created by Microsoft at the time, AJAX almost certainly wouldn’t be as ubiquitous as it is today.<p>- SQL Server 20xx:  Perhaps RDMS's aren't your thing, but they're very much needed for now, and Microsoft's can certainly handle most relational db needs.<p>- .NET 3.5+ and C# 3+:  If you want a statically typed language and platform, anything .NET 3.5 or greater are at least ok.<p>- ASP.NET MVC 2+:  Not quit the same as a dynamically-based ROR or Django and they also don’t give you a default ORM; you pick it, but its solid and improving.  Source code is available; contribs aren’t.<p>- Visual Studio 2008+:  Again, not some crazy vim/emacs setup, although plugins can somewhat help simulate that, but these definitely don’t suck at all.<p>- IIS7+:  Just because it’s not Apache doesn't mean it isn't decent.  It is quite powerful and secure.<p>- Windows Server 2003+:  Never had bad experiences with these.<p>- Microsoft Security Essentials: Very good and free antivirus.<p>I’m sure there’s more, but it is an exaggeration to say Microsoft hasn’t made any decent products.  Certainly some of these don’t seem as good overall when accounting for the licensing costs and associated culture/stigma that comes with working in Microsoft shops, but many of products in and of themselves are decent.",1283543756

To my continued amazement, the Perl folks are the only ones who never get upset. They just say ""Haha, yeah, boy, you're right, it sure is ugly. Heh. Yeah, so, um, anyway, I'm going to get back to work now..."" It's awesome. I've gained so much respect for them. It's almost enough to make me go back to programming in Perl.'<p>In my experience (which of course is just as anecdotal at Steve's), this is very true.  Zed Shaw writes yet another blog post blasting whatever technology crawled up his ass and died, and we just smirk and update our modules on CPAN.  But while that means we're not getting caught up in the ""narcissism of small differences"" (to refer to an earlier commenter), it also means we're not part of the noise on the web.  There will probably never be a ""Perl is a Ghetto"" blog post written, and while that's obviously a good thing, it can also lead to the perception that, ""man, nobody's talking about Perl, nobody's even bashing Perl, is it dead?""<p>d) That said, in my opinion these languages don't hold a candle to Perl when it comes to back-end engineering.  We love talking about startups here at HN and thus, we talk a lot about startup problems and their solutions.  But if your startup actually grows into a real company, you're going to encounter problems like, ""we need a system to allow our analysts to manage our SEM campaigns and reconcile our cost and revenue"" or ""this partner doesn't have an API so we need to spider their interface to get the daily data and import it into our data warehouse.""  And any company that dismisses Perl as an option for those problems just because of (a) (b) and (c) is doing their company a disservice.<p>TL;DR -- Perl's strengths don't match the trendy topics on communities like HN, but it still has real value for real business problems.",1283540938

I admittedly has better optics. And it crashes less.<p>Administrative tasks got more tiresome though, compared to XP you have to wade through more windows to get to a specific configuration point. That gets very irksome if you want to perform some configuration for a dozen PC's. (Enough to make it very repetitive, too little that automation would make much sense, especially considering the abysmal automation tools Windows comes with <i>cough</i>shell<i>cough</i>). Other critical points are software management systems (lack of) and general disability in the usability sector.<p>Granted, learning to cope with a Linux system is somewhat more challenging, but once you are into it, it's really much less bother to do things, no matter the scale.<p>Microsoft still has a long way to go just to reach the current status. Maybe they will manage, as they seem to be very apt at keeping the stranglehold on the market.<p>And I will keep avoiding them as much as I can.",1283540920

1660695,comment,1660297,1660297,0,0,ekidd,,,"I've played with ZeroMQ on some small projects, and I've been quite impressed by it. Basically, ZeroMQ was designed to send millions of small, mostly-asynchronous messages at extremely high speeds. If you feed it messages very rapidly, it sends the first message immediately, and queues the rest in userspace until (IIRC) the network card is ready to transmit another packet. Then it sends all the queued messages as a batch. So you get both high throughput and low latency.<p>There's some built-in support for common topologies (client/server, publish/subscribe, pipeline), and if you're willing to use the undocumented XREQ/XREP socket types, you can build more exotic topologies.<p>Most of the value in ZeroMQ is the actual C++ implementation, so other languages generally just wrap the C++ code. The zeromq API is tiny.<p>I haven't used it on a big production project yet, but I hope to do that soon.",1283540809

Some really did know exactly what they were doing, and it worked. But a lot of scientists frankly admit that the big career-making thing they did wasn't even something they thought was important at the time--- and sometimes nobody else thought it was important either, and it languished in a journal for 10 years before someone else noticed it had big implications. Of course, that's not purely luck, because they'd never have had that opportunity to get their work belatedly discovered if they hadn't done good work on interesting problems, and published it. But there does seem to be some element of luck in the work turning out to be huge. There are plenty of people in exactly the same position who do good work on interesting problems, write a good journal article, and it <i>doesn't</i> turn out 10 years later to have unexpected but important implications, winning them the Nobel Prize. Just sort of how it happens; you can't always predict what is going to turn out to be important.<p>I could be wrong, but my impression is that wealthy businessmen are somewhat less willing to admit the role of luck than famous scientists are. Due to real differences in the role of luck in the two areas? Due to political considerations (the implications of admitting that wealth disparities aren't all due to merit are more political than the implications of admitting that scientific fame isn't purely due to merit)? Due to the self-deprecating scientists being humbler personalities? Dunno. And I could be wrong on the aggregate difference; I haven't done a survey or anything.",1283540409

So you have to make it very explicit which you mean when you talk about them. You can&#x27;t generally interchange them in all contexts, but in some contexts you definitely can.<p>In Type theory, the product is a product in the sense of category theory, which is a very abstract notion of product indeed. The idea is that given objects, here types, A and B; you can form their product, A * B and that is also a valid object in the category. The diagram then universally identifies the A * B element as the one where you can project out of it via the 1st and 2nd projection such the at given diagram commutes, etc. And it is important to stress there are many products for which this property hold.<p>(Edited a bit to appease the automatic formatter at HN)",1406797037

The IOM also found limited or suggestive evidence linking exposure to damp indoor environments in general to shortness of breath, to respiratory illness in otherwise healthy children and to potential development of asthma in susceptible individuals. In 2009, the World Health Organization issued additional guidance, the WHO Guidelines for Indoor Air Quality: Dampness and Mould. Other recent studies have suggested a potential link of early mold exposure to development of asthma in some children, particularly among children who may be genetically susceptible to asthma development, and that selected interventions that improve housing conditions can reduce morbidity from asthma and respiratory allergies, but more research is needed in this regard.<p>Whether that counts as &quot;downright unhealthy&quot; is up to you.<p><a href=""http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0003/78636/Damp_Mould_Brochure.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0003/78636/Da...</a>",1406794054

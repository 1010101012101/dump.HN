For society at large, who gives a shit?<p>I think this would be a much clearer discussion if we defined ""Special"" and ""Important"" properly (and realized that they mean very different things to different people).<p>There are a lot of people on HN/YC who are trying to hack together a successful internet company. For them, I don't think Matt's definitions of Special or Important are all that useful, because they ignore a lot of viable business ideas -- ideas that fill a niche which is inane by itself, but economically important to a few focused souls. If you make your living building Widget X, then no matter how trivial that widget is to its users lives, it is <i>everything</i> to the people who devote their lives/company to producing it.<p>The better our economy evolves to allow niche ideas to make money, the harder time we're going to have figuring out how to define ""Important"". It is increasingly possible to earn a living doing something that's entirely trivial from a ""big picture"" point of view... but as soon as you're earning a living from it, it's become important (to you).",1207889963

160743,comment,160408,160698,0,0,blader,,,"Facebook is different from MySpace for exactly the use case of keeping up with your friends. Facebook is the only social network so far that rigorously enforces real names, identities and relationships through both social design and brute force. MySpace has degenerated in to a social game to rack up more points in the form of 'friends'. They are completely different, which is why Facebook is catching up to MySpace so quickly and MySpace is sinking.",1207889870

I could replace 'Facebook' with 'email' and 'Google' with 'the telephone' and your rant would make about as much sense, but it'd be just as wrong.",1207889637

160738,comment,160704,160704,0,0,tandaraho,,,"Rather than explicitly banning Valleywag or other particular sources, it might be more useful if PG can leverage his influence in this community by adding to the posting etiquette thread from a few weeks ago (right after the rush caused by TC) regarding the type of content that is the aim/target of this space.

First thing you sign when you join a new employer is an agreement that says something like ""I am not under any other company's non-compete"".<p>While this might not be enforceable, if you were a small company in a similar space, would you really risk hiring someone if you might get attacked by Google's lawyers?",1207889464

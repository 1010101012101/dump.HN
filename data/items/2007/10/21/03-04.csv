70805,comment,70711,70711,0,0,aaroniba,,,"We use Helma for our (unlaunched) YC startup, and we love it.<p>It's faster than rails, and IMO nicer to develop with.  Having all the Java libraries without having to code in Java is sweet.  The ORM is really well-designed and the built-in object cache is super fast.  The template system has its quirks, but once you get used to it, is also really sweet.<p>It's a shame helma wasn't documented or evangelized as well as rails was.  I think it's a better framework that just didn't catch on because it wasn't marketed well.",1192938821

Would you care to elaborate on why I should be downmodded?",1192938522

For all accounts, we could start by breaking the stereotype that nerds will all end as 40 year-old virgins.<p>Second, there was a study [1] that showed high correlation between lower testosterone levels and higher IQ, and little correlation between testosterone levels and sex drive.<p>Third, as someone already said before, the article tells little about age, and <i>that</i> is something way more connected with hormone levels than marital status.<p><p>[1] : <a href=""http://www.gnxp.com/blog/2007/04/intercourse-and-intelligence.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gnxp.com/blog/2007/04/intercourse-and-intelligenc...</a>",1192936754

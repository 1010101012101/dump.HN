They could also tag pictures with the names of related things so you could search based on objects that are commonly found near or work with the thing you're looking for. The picture would help you confirm you found the right thing.<p>For example, suppose you didn't know what the little plastic thing on the end of your shoelace was called and you wanted to buy more of them. You could search for ""shoelace"" or ""end of shoelace"" and find a picture of an aglet. Maybe even some ads to where you could buy a supply of aglets. Now, no more frayed shoelace ends for you, and life is a little better. :)",1231513026

Like I said before, you hire for your business based on need. The idea you'd have ""more employees"" because of a ""tax surplus"" is a myth. Especially from business owners that condescend to their employees and coerce their votes.

426622,comment,423839,423972,0,0,redrobot5050,,,">Even if its a truly bad convention (e.g. the Add/Remove Programs control panel does more than Add or Remove) its better than nothing. At the very least, if you're going to rename it -- have names that are clear and obvious like ""Uninstall Software"" for its name.<p>I decided to re-quote that. Its just one of the tenants of Human-Computer-Interaction. Microsoft apologists can ignore that all they want, but an existing convention, even a wrong one, beats a change that is equally poor.<p>Does ""Programs and Features"" do anything more/less than ""Add/Remove Programs"" in Vista SP3? No.<p>Its like if MS had done a UI study and concluded that left-click and right-click's functionality should be reversed. Sure, maybe it is ""more usable"". But to those of us who have been ""right clicking"" for a contextual menu for 15-20 years, it will feel alien.<p>>You seem to be one of those people that complains that Microsoft didn't add enough features in Vista in one thread and then complain in another that they changed everything around. You're complaining about superficial changes and willfully ignoring real functionality - the search-focused UI is a dramatic improvement, and you can claim it was taken from OS X or what have you but that doesn't make Vista's implementation any less useful.<p>Sir, I've made no such claims, and you're putting words in my mouth. With regards to search, I've found their implementation inferior not only to OS X's spotlight, but also Google Desktop Search. Especially pre-SP1 Vista search. But assuming you don't have Google Desktop Search installed (like the <i>average</i> user) it is still a usability win. But again, not worth a $400 upgrade, considering Google Desktop Search is free and runs great on XP SP3.<p>>Real power users will learn the new methods and features and probably learn to love them, and probably upgrade and/or dualboot/virtualize Linux. That's what I've been doing, and I'll continue to do that. On the other hand, whiny noobs on the internet will continue to whine about everything Microsoft does because they can't adjust to change.<p>Most of us Real Power Users whine about Microsoft is because they only time we're exposed to Vista is when something has broken. Like most Real Power Users I've adapted to the big change (internet apps) and haven't seen MS as technically relevant since I stopped working as a .NET developer in 2005. (Disclaimer: In the past six months I've started doing .NET development again.)<p>So yeah, most of us have adjusted to change. By bypassing crap when there are better alternatives.",1231512668
426621,comment,425789,425789,0,0,scott_s,,,"His timeline doesn't apply to Computer Science - and possibly other fields like engineering, but I have much less experience with them. Because CS Ph.D.s can get industry jobs, there's less need for them to do postdocs. Some do, but it's still common for freshly minted Ph.D.s to get academic jobs. Of course, getting those positions is still just as difficult as it is for the real sciences, but there's not necessarily the 2-6 year delay.<p>I've given this topic some thought recently. Academia has it's problems, but what I do like is that I can work on things that are interesting and useful, but not necessarily profitable.<p>How can something be useful without being profitable? I do research in systems and high performance. In theory, the software we create could be sold. Some startups exist that do just that - Cilk Arts and RapidMind are two examples. But I'm skeptical of their viability; companies that exists solely to sell compilers rarely do well.<p>The kind of research I do is valuable to companies, but rarely as something to sell on its own. Intel, for example, does research in programming models for emerging architectures not because they want to sell that software, but because they need it so programmers can use the processors they do sell.",1231512641

426615,comment,426370,426370,0,0,opticksversi,,,"Something I have not seen pointed out yet (in articles and discussions over the preceding many years) is the fact that CAPTCHA tests are essentially Gestalt Completion tests. A Gestalt Completion test is a type of IQ test. As CAPTCHA tests get progressively more difficult to solve, they might weed out progressively larger portions of the population - the <i>human</i> population, that is.<p>Perhaps, as a side-effect, the quality of web-based discussion will rise.<p>.<p>From Arthur Jensen's 1980 book <i>Bias in Mental Testing</i> (pp157-158):<p><i>Gestalt Completion. Familiar words and objects are shown in various degrees of ""mutilation"" and the subject must infer what the word or object is. Performance is scored according to the average time taken per item or the number of items completed within a given time limit. The difficulty of any given item is a function of its familiarity and the extent of the ""mutilation""; these can be varied independently in making up items. ... Gestalt completion items, which are known to be a good measure of the general intelligence factor (as well as of a small group factor labeled speed of closure), merit further experimental investigation in their own right.</i>",1231512246

426609,comment,424648,425402,0,0,redrobot5050,,,">1. PCs are cheaper than Macs, hardware wise, so if you compare them at price-point, Windows will probably still come out on top. 2gb ram on a PC is probably cheaper than 1gb ram on a Mac.<p>Maybe you haven't heard, but Macs use Intel chipsets now. RAM is RAM. The 90% of the mac faithful that have actually bought a mac before switcher ads know that you <i>never</i> buy RAM from Apple. And let's avoid the price-point argument because it can really go either way depending on what you're doing and what you're looking for.<p>>2. There's a ""Classic View"" option on the side of the control panel that allows you to see ""Add/Remove Programs""<p><i></i>FAIL<i></i>. I was using classic view. Its not called ""Add/Remove Programs"" anymore. I even fired up my Vista Business VHD image on my XP workstation to double check...and yup....FAIL UI still FAILs at UI. The control panel is called ""Programs and Features"".<p>Also, your analogy makes no sense whatsoever. GM is billing for pensions and obligations it agreed to shoulder in good faith, but never funded, because it assumed it would never faulter in terms of revenue, and thus, it would have the income to pay out those obligations at a later date. Unions are about 3% of the problem. Bad Design and Bad Management are  the other insignificant 97%.",1231511874

426591,comment,426014,426014,0,0,mdasen,,,"So, many cities have bus systems and those bus systems now-a-days are usually GPS equipped for several reasons (notably that a central office can monitor the system and that the busses can announce ADA-compliant stop messages based on location without the driver being involved).<p>I'd love to have something on my phone that would tell me where the next bus was on a cool Google Map (or other) and an estimated time to arrival (which could be calculated by Google Maps).  Of course, you'd have to get your transit authority to give you access to their GPS results.<p>But this would probably be one of the most helpful things a transit authority could do.  The problem most people have with public transit is that it can be inconvenient, but often it <i>is</i> convenient if you have better/more complete knowledge of it.  For example, when I get up in the morning, I have no idea whether a bus went by a minute ago and it'll be another 20+ minutes waiting or whether a bus is 2 minutes away.<p>This could also help trip planning.  Often in a mass transit system, there are multiple routes to get anywhere.  The trip planners we have today are primitive in that they often don't take current information into account (such as speed at various times of day, location of the next bus/trolly/subway train in proximity, etc.).  Using GPS information would greatly change that.",1231510932

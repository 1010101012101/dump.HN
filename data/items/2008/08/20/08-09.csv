To quote you, if I may, ""that is the worst logic I've ever seen.""",1219222797

That feeling might come from many reasons. I wouldn't use it as an argument without a detailed survey that evaluates things like response time, charges for reparations, or kindness of personal.",1219222568
281318,comment,280669,280669,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Awesome.  After spending way too much time staring at horrendously verbose and chattery PHP code lately (and being a Perl, and occasionally Python, developer historically), I've begun to wish for some resources on cutting down the verbosity dramatically.  It's just painful to read most PHP code (many folks complain about Perl code, but at least most of it is <i>short</i>, and the culture encourages brevity and conciseness).  PHP developers often seem to have some sort of inferiority complex about their language not being Java, and so they try to make it more like Java whenever possible.  Which is, frankly, nuts.  Java has its positive aspects, but none of those things are going to be achieved PHP by trying to emulate the syntax and OO conventions of the language.<p>Now if only an appreciation for the beauty of brevity would find its way into the PHP culture.",1219222532

281316,comment,281221,281221,0,0,jsomers,,,"Good essay.<p>I liken the difference between Python and Java to internships at small and large companies, respectively. In the small company, you can do meaningful work in any departmentâ€”you can be the cook, accountant, and network engineer in the same day, just as you can parse XML, send automated e-mails, and invert large matrices in Python with plug-and-play modules. At a small company everything's transparent, and on a scale you can understand; there's no organization for organization's sake, no vapid meetings or processes, just problems that need to be solved and the tools you need to solve them.<p>It is only when the small company grows, when the founders can't interview every new employee and the clients aren't recognizable by name, when managers and engineers are disjoint groups, that one needs all the stuff they teach you at business school. To round out the conceit: the Java curriculum is that stuff. And to a kid just learning to program, it's cruft.",1219222162

Stayed with me for three years before the logic board start to go out on me; freeze ups, bad video, etc. It seems like it was either asleep or on, and always with me so I kind of expected it.<p>Another person I was acquainted with seemed to have this same problem but every few months or so.

281308,comment,281158,281304,0,0,sd,,,"I think the concern is that HTTPS is necessary, but not sufficient for security.  If you use HTTPS on your site, but send cookies without the secure flag, then it is possible for someone to trick the user into acquiring (or otherwise obtain) standard HTTP content.  Setting the secure flag requires that all content sent relative to the cookie be from HTTPS.  Hopefully, that makes some sense.",1219220769

Get a thread up and running where people can post some of the worst ideas they can think of for the people applying for this (and later) rounds of funding.<p>Sort of like a process of elimination; people can cross-check their ideas against a list of pre-determined list of bad ones for similarities. Might help with an early filtering process or even good for a laugh.<p>For example:<p>It's like a toilet, but only more social!\nThis is not only a bad idea, but I think George Michael has already done this.",1219220123

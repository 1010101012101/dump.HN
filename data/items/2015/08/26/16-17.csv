A cold-blooded capitalist may argue this was a &#x27;win&#x27; for the company in terms of income, but regardless a business decision was made and there was huge damage as a result.<p>To summarise the second, Nestlé tried to encourage groups of mothers in developing countries to give up breast feeding their babies and sell them infant formula instead. They do so at first by giving out free samples. Numerous problems ensued (including the mothers&#x27; no longer being able to produce breast milk for their babies, leading to deaths once the free samples stopped and the mothers were no longer able to afford the infant formula).<p>There are plenty of other examples (especially in the areas of environmental pollution and worker conditions), I&#x27;m guessing I don&#x27;t need to go on.",1440608288

10124298,comment,10123456,10124020,0,0,api,,,"My own view is this:<p>The ideal would be to have a strong social safety net and a fair system of redistribution that operates with minimal micromanagement or intrusion into individual affairs.<p>Basically you have a government that taxes everyone according to the same rate and provides health care, unemployment and disability protection, insurance against certain emergencies (FEMA, etc.), and some sort of basic income. But as long as you pay into this system and are a &#x27;shareholder&#x27; you can do whatever you want.<p>Employment should be at-will. Companies should be easy to start. Regulations should be minimal and justified by specific rationales (e.g. environmental protection).<p>The problem with the USSR and to a much lesser extent European Socialist countries is that they try to micro-manage. They have all these messes of laws that try to dictate exactly how things work and exactly how people must live their lives. That doesn&#x27;t work. It just chokes everything and weighs everything down.<p>The irony is that all this micro-management is put into place because the obvious alternative -- just redistributing wealth -- is politically toxic. So instead of just redistributing wealth, we try to reach in and piecemeal adjust the operation of capitalism to make it &#x27;more fair.&#x27; The end result is the worst of both worlds: the system remains unfair, and we end up with micromanaging regulations that are far more expensive than what it would cost to just redistribute wealth.<p>The US healthcare system is a great example. We have everything that is bad about micro-managing Socialism (heavy regulations, bureaucracy, inefficiency) combined with everything that is bad about capitalism/free market healthcare (inequality, losing coverage when you get sick, etc.).<p>No &quot;system&quot; is fair. All systems contain intrinsic biases, emergent behaviors, randomness, massive opportunities for cheating and exploitation, and unintentional/non-obvious &quot;goal functions&quot; that conflict with the stated intents of their designers or operators. Constructing a fair system through central planning is impossible... IMHO it is &quot;perpetual motion&quot; or &quot;halting problem&quot; impossible. Complex living systems are not logical and their behaviors cannot be pre-specified by an intelligent designer.<p>Wealth redistribution is the obvious answer. Instead of trying to impose the impossible on a chaotic counter-intuitive world, just apply noise reduction and normalization.",1440607971

The only problem is that it&#x27;s deliberately ignorant of the past.  Since the author mentions SF Muni by name, we should recognize that Muni has been a total disaster since at least the 1970s.  If there has ever been political will to improve it, it&#x27;s been thwarted.  The agency has never met any of its legally mandated service requirements, despite numerous (successful) ballot measures throwing money at the problem and setting policies giving it a high (&quot;the highest&quot;, per Prop A) priority.  So it&#x27;s pretty difficult to pin the blame for that on something that&#x27;s existed for only a few years.<p>It&#x27;s no secret that I have no love for Uber, or that I consider it just another taxi service that should be regulated as such (which doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean it should be regulated the way taxi providers are <i>today</i>).  But claims that Muni&#x27;s failure are Uber&#x27;s fault are simply laughable.  Muni was a worthless pile of garbage before Uber&#x27;s founders were born, and it wasn&#x27;t on an improving trajectory that Uber came along and trashed, either.<p>The other angle, which the author did not explore, is that private mass transit is very common and popular, as it once was in the US, in many of the world&#x27;s poorer countries.  It&#x27;s ubiquitous in Asia and Latin America, and while it won&#x27;t win any awards for speed or comfort, it is cheap, effective, and capable of operating profitably without direct subsidies.  This seems at odds with the author&#x27;s lament that those left to suffer the indignity of public transit in the US are those with no other choice.  Clearly that is a product of a political system that champions public funding of mass transit, not some inevitable outcome.<p>There are many ways to make transit (public or private) better.  I don&#x27;t believe Uber is one of them, but nothing the SFMTA has done suggests that it&#x27;s part of the solution, either.  And it&#x27;s been failing without Uber&#x27;s help.",1440607301

You will be regarded as just another expendable cost on the bottom line, and you will be replaced by a younger, hungrier individual with less commitments outside of work. The company will find a way around the laws that generally protect mothers/fathers in these situations - that is why they are a market leader, because they will go where no other companies are willing/able to in order to uphold the mantra of operational excellence.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.marsdd.com/mars-library/competitive-strategies-in-operational-excellence-customer-intimacy-and-product-leadership/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.marsdd.com/mars-library/competitive-strategies-in...</a>",1440606690

If the senior management of a large company make a big mistake, they aren&#x27;t the only ones who lose: some employees may lose their jobs, the company may be less effective in providing customers with useful products or services, etc. And, conversely, if they do something very right, their employees may get bonuses or pay rises and their customers may get useful things to buy. And even government bureaucrats are likely to do better for themselves when they make good decisions than when they make bad ones.<p>But it&#x27;s a reasonable approximation. On the whole and on average, businessmen are in business to benefit themselves, and fortunately it turns out that when you have lots of people doing that it brings benefits to everyone.

We all are in fact. It&#x27;s a stratification of society; there&#x27;s one transportation scheme for the rich, Uber, and one transportation scheme for the poor, government-funded mass transit.&quot;<p>If you want to define &quot;harm&quot; as &quot;one day, a new thing pops up, and only the rich have access to it because it&#x27;s very expensive, and now the poor are more harmed than they were yesterday because there&#x27;s a thing they don&#x27;t have access to that didn&#x27;t exist yesterday&quot;, that&#x27;s your decision.

You&#x27;ve defined yourself up a definition of harm that can <i>never be fixed, by definition</i>.

It can&#x27;t be helped, only at most minimized, and economics being what they are, you can blow a lot of money that really ought to be helping people <i>now</i> trying too hard to push that date forward beyond what it naturally &quot;wants&quot; to do.<p>If that reality bothers you... well, good, you&#x27;re human.

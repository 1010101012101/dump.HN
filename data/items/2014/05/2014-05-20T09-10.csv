Neoreactionaries like to see themselves as the heroes of another sci-fi movie, in fact, sometimes boasting that they have been “redpilled,” like Keanu Reeves’s character in The Matrix—a movie Moldbug regards as “genius.”&quot;<p>And now we&#x27;re in the territory of implied racism, straw-manning and caricature.<p>&quot;By so doing, Moldbug has been able to an attract an audience that welcomes the usual teeth-gnashing white supremacists who haunt the web while also leaving room for a more socially acceptable assortment of “men’s rights” advocates, gun nuts, transhumanist libertarians, disillusioned Occupiers and well-credentialed Silicon Valley entrepreneurs.&quot;<p>By the time we get here the sweeping generalizations have become the entire article and it&#x27;s no longer about the material in question but an excuse for the author to broadbrush everyone he personally dislikes into a neat little category. Seems more like he was using 4chan&#x27;s /pol/ section than Moldbug&#x27;s blog. Please note that I&#x27;m not a Moldbug fan and I loathe Justine Tunney, for the record; but this article reeks of other issues and definitely of straw-manning those who critique mainstream journalism:<p>&quot;Apart from their reverence for old-timey tyrants, they espouse a belief in “human biodiversity,” which is basically racism in a lab coat. This scientific-sounding euphemism invariably refers to supposed differences in intelligence across races. It is so spurious that the Wikipedia article on human biodiversity was deleted because, in the words of one editor, it is “purely an Internet theory.” Censored once again by The Cathedral, alas.&quot;<p>The problem here is again, the broadbrush of &#x27;racism&#x27; - Again, not an HBD believer - but to instantly use that label is bigoted reporting and confirmation bias and shows a lack of journalistic ethics.<p>Furthermore, Wikipedia draws its primary credibility from mainstream news, which primary draws its stories from small outlets or other large outlets (Reuters) and reprints them. Essentially; this is a journalist thumbing his nose and saying &#x27;aha, behold, I&#x27;m the man, I am sponsored&#x27;.<p>&quot;“If you ask me to condemn [mass murderer] Anders Breivik, but adore Nelson Mandela, perhaps you have a mother you’d like to fuck,” Yarvin writes.&quot;<p>Note that the paraphrase adds &quot;mass murderer&quot; to Breivik who killed 77, but not to Nelson Mandela who killed tens of thousands as part of the MK and their bombing campaigns.<p>&quot;Yet the conservative press remains generally dismissive.&quot; This is an outright lie and fabrication; the conservative publications which reviewed Moldbug&#x27;s work loved it.<p>&quot;If the Koch brothers have proved anything, it’s that no matter how crazy your ideas are, if you put serious money behind those ideas, you can seize key positions of authority and power and eventually bring large numbers of people around to your way of thinking. Moreover, the radicalism may intensify with each generation. Yesterday’s Republicans and Independents are today’s Libertarians. Today’s Libertarians may be tomorrow’s neoreactionaries, whose views flatter the prejudices of the new Silicon Valley elite.&quot;<p>And now we&#x27;ve gone to Koch and assumed insanity - this from the supposedly trustworthy folks over at The Baffler - nothing less than a farce at this point. For every Koch there is a Soros. The money pool is bipartisan.<p>&quot;The formulation mirrored Moldbug’s “Cathedral.” Srinivasan’s central theme was the notion of “exit”—as in, exit from democratic society, and entry into any number of corporate mini-states whose arrival will leave the world looking like a patchwork map of feudal Europe.&quot;<p>Now everyone is Moldbug; straw man complete.<p>This article is a great example of how supposed anti-racism quickly turns into an equally vapid form of bigotry against skeptics and that &#x27;anti-racism&#x27; includes, like any collective, some of the most bigoted individuals in the world.<p>Please note that the author of all these knee-jerk reactions to supposed &#x27;racism&#x27; is a well-dressed middle-upper class male in Corey Pein. Do we really need successful white male journalists to fight racism and hierarchy in print and label everyone who does not as &#x27;Moldbug&#x27; or a potential member of Stormfront?<p>I cannot help but mourn the future of journalism as the liberal outlets take over with massive contributions and yet continually straw man Koch industries while they receive billions from Soros, Bloomberg, et al.<p>Why must the supposed opposition be labeled as racist, insane, etc.? Why aren&#x27;t the ideas analyzed in an academic, scientific manner? Have we passed the age of rational discussion in favor of writing those who disagree with us off as lunatics, &#x27;sympathizers&#x27; and &#x27;oppressors&#x27; in the age of the oppression olympics?",1400578573

We live at the edge of a small city center in Belgium.<p>Originally, we both worked full time, lived in a small house, and had income to spare to save some and do some small-scale travelling within Europe. With no kids, there was not really a lot of stress and &quot;busyness&quot; for us; the household chores had to be done in the evenings and weekends, but other than that we didn&#x27;t feel overwhelmed. (Although it sometimes did feel that way anyway.)<p>After the first kid was born, my girlfriend started working 80% instead of 100%, to cope better with the additional tasks imposed by caring for the child. The second kid added to the child care burden, leading us to delegate some of the cleaning chores to a household helper (4hrs every 2 weeks), which is not for free. The situation stabilized, but we do feel overwhelmed by the tight planning of each day, and chores left to do in the evenings and weekends.<p>Weekends are not always relaxing any more: even family visits have a tendency to start feeling like a burden if they displace other things that you have to do, and if several of them queue up in the same weekend or if several consecutive weekends become fully booked this way. Also, we try to build in &quot;down&quot;time in the weekend to let the kids play or to do something with the 4 of us, but this becomes more difficult with all the other engagements competing for time.<p>I too have requested a contract change to work 90% instead of 100%, so that I can move some of the chores from the evening and weekend to a weekday. This will hopefully leave us with more relaxed evenings and weekends.<p>I realize that in some sense we&#x27;re lucky that our finances permit us to trade some income for more time off work. I think (hope) we&#x27;re approaching a OK balance between work, child care, &quot;obligatory&quot; off-work stuff, and &quot;voluntary&quot; off-work stuff.<p>(Note: 100% means 40hrs/wk here)",1400578319

7771768,comment,7771611,7771727,9,0,chriswarbo,,,"D-Wave&#x27;s machine is running an approximate optimisation algorithm. It&#x27;s like trying to solve a large Sudoku by filling in all of the squares randomly then adjusting them to make the solution better and better (ie. get fewer invalid squares).<p>They&#x27;re using an &#x27;annealing&#x27; algorithm to do this, which means that the squares are all adjusted concurrently, in a random way which is biased by how well each square&#x27;s value fits with its neighbour&#x27;s. D-Wave claimed that their machine is quantum, without much evidence. They&#x27;ve since shown reasonable evidence that their machine does indeed use quantum effects, so that it&#x27;s running a &#x27;quantum annealing&#x27; algorithm; that basically means there&#x27;s some probability for non-neighbouring squares to interact, which may find better solutions faster.<p>However, &#x27;quantum annealing&#x27; isn&#x27;t difficult to calculate. Despite the name, it&#x27;s easy for classical computers to implement it and they can do it faster than D-Wave&#x27;s machine (thanks to decades of Moore&#x27;s Law). So at this point D-Wave have a single-purpose ASIC which is more expensive and slower than regular computers. They&#x27;re doing something quantum, but there doesn&#x27;t seem to be much point.<p>Compare this to a &quot;real&quot; quantum computer, which would be general-purpose (rather than being restricted to one algorithm like D-Wave&#x27;s machine) and would be able to efficiently run things like Shor&#x27;s algorithm, which are known to be unscalable on classical computers.",1400578031

There&#x27;s also no interaction between RA and instruction selection, despite them both influencing each other, whereas a human programmer will essentially combine those two steps together.

I was high functioning an in 1975 there was no such thing as high functioning autism, that wasn&#x27;t discovered until 1994, so I got diagnosed with depression instead. Child Psychologist told my parents to put me into a school for gifted children, but they put me in public school instead where I struggled and my brain worked 10 times faster so I was always ahead of the class in learning and bored waiting for people to catch up. I was still bullied and picked on and this interfered with my learning. The same thing happened when I went to college and had a job, I was bullied and picked on. I never reached my potential and my mental illness was one of the reasons why and people picking on me was another reason, and had I been in a school for gifted children I&#x27;d be able to reach my potential better.<p>I developed schizoaffective disorder in 2001 and it screws with my memory and focus and concentration. I ended up on disability in 2003. My career is basically over but I still have a potential I never met.<p>What good is a high IQ if you can&#x27;t reach your potential to use it?<p>We keep hearing talk of an AI that is smarter than a human being, but we haven&#x27;t seen one yet. Our current AI programs are not as smart as a human being yet, but they can do tasks that put human beings out of work. Just having a perfect memory, and being able to do fast math equations makes an AI in the &quot;Rainman&quot; category <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095953/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095953/</a> even if it is not as smart as a human being.<p>I guess what I am trying to say is that an AI doesn&#x27;t have to be as smart as a human being to be dangerous. Just like the Google Maps app that drives people off a cliff or into an ocean. An AI can make robocalls and sell a product and put people out of work. You can replace almost any line of work with an AI, and then it gets dangerous when a majority of people are unemployed by AIs that aren&#x27;t even as smart as a human being.<p>I&#x27;d like to see a personal AI that works for poor and disabled people to earn money for them, as they run it on a personal computer. Doing small tasks on an SEO marketplace using webbots for $5 each and 100 tasks a day for $500 in a Paypal account to help lift them out of poverty. I know there are people already doing this for their own personal gain, but if the AI that does that is open sourced so disabled and poor people can run it, it can help solve the problem of poverty.",1450414268

Most stream ciphers (including ChaCha20 and RC4) work by generating a pseudorandom bitstream based on the key which is then xor&#x27;d with the cleartext to produce the ciphertext.

Fb nukes the server, confirms the RCE, pays out $2500 for it, declines to pay for the second finding, and asks the tester not to use RCEs to explore their systems.</i><p>The issue here is that, in hindsight, FB failed at this step.<p>They nuked the server, but they didn&#x27;t determine what sensitive information was available on that server, and take steps to mitigate those risks.<p>I think that&#x27;s an understandable mistake - cleaning up after a server intrusion is hard. Knowing how much to do after a <i>possible</i> intrusion is even harder. <i>But</i> it is still a mistake and it happened on Alex&#x27;s watch.<p>If the purpose of the bounty program is to find out about your security mistakes, then the program did its job here, and Alex should be pleased that the problem was reported so that they could fix it.<p>That the researcher found the mistake by overstepping what is considered ethical (and I have no doubt that they did overstep) creates a very difficult situation - you don&#x27;t want to reward that behaviour, but you do want to know about security problems and this one was only discovered/reported because of that bad behaviour.<p>In that difficult situation it is all the more important to tread carefully. The easy cases where you&#x27;re paying out a $10k bounty typically don&#x27;t require much finesse. It&#x27;s the tricky cases where you need to make sure your actions are well considered and above-board at every step.<p>From Alex&#x27;s own summary it&#x27;s evident that he didn&#x27;t handle it as well as he could have.<p>Two of the longest paragraphs in Alex&#x27;s write up cover what he said to the CEO of Synack, even though Synack had nothing to do with this. Even if we accept that Alex thought it likely the Wes was acting on behalf of Synack (personally, I don&#x27;t think that was a reasonable conclusion to draw, thought I assume Alex is sincere in his view that it was), he should have determined that up front, and then, once he knew it was not work related, he should have avoided:<p>- making accusations about Wes&#x27;s ethics to his boss (<i>&quot;Wes ... had acted unethically&quot;</i>)<p>- suggesting that his external behaviour has implications for his employment (<i>&quot;Wes&#x27;s behavior reflected poorly ... on Synack&quot;</i>)<p>- bringing in the threat of lawyers (<i>&quot;keep this out of the hands of the lawyers&quot;</i>)<p>When faced with the difficult situation of legitimate security research that has (well) overstepped the ethical boundaries, all the evidence is that Alex jumped to the position of <i>protect yourself, protect the company, intimidate and control the researcher</i> and though that is a common and understandable reaction, it&#x27;s not the way you turn a bad situation like this into a good one.",1450413501

Also fundamental was that memory was addressable by cells, and that adding one to a pointer (which could also be an integer) must cause it to refer to the next cell. This could only be implemented efficiently on a word-addressed machine. When confronted with the byte-addressed PDP-11, they created a language where the basic unit was a &quot;char&quot;. Fortunately, they also added types, so that the language could adapt to changing architectures. However, they were fortunate, or foresighted, in that virtually every architecture after the mid-70&#x27;s was byte-addressable. C does not adapt well to word-addressed machines, but that didn&#x27;t slow its adoption because word-addressed machines disappeared rapidly after C was born.",1450413278

The problem with Forward Error Correction is that it can&#x27;t deal with too many sequential errors, so many modems use something known as an interleaver. An reorders bits as they are sent over the air, so instead of sending LSB to MSB or vice versa you are sending bits in a random yet mutually known order. This causes link quality issues such as interference to not interfere with continuous bits (to the benefit of the FEC decoder). The problem with an interleaver is that it causes latency to go up. If you interleave based on 256 bits of 2048bits, you can&#x27;t decode blocks of data until you&#x27;ve received all of this bits. So the 288 bit interleaver that 802.11 uses won&#x27;t cause many problems if you&#x27;re streaming but if you are interleaving data across multiple packets you will notice a spike in video latency.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viterbi_algorithm"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viterbi_algorithm</a>\n[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-density_parity-check_code"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-density_parity-check_code</a>",1450412677

Reservoir computing can be seen as random projections: echo state networks, liquid state machines, extreme learning machines. Does it involve extra constraints? Sparsity? Nonnegativity? Which random projection schemes do not conform similar to humans?<p>Very difficult to distill more info out of this!",1450411241

The images used, the division of products and copy layout are done really well.<p>In regards to concept, I think it&#x27;s great YC is promoting YC cos at every opportunity it gets. Sometimes it feels like an ad, but this time it does not. Perfectly timed &quot;launch&quot; of the site.<p>I think you&#x27;ve done a better job than most, in both content and design. I looked at the site a few hours ago, and was thinking of the team and the week of prep work that YC put into building this. Never could have believed it was made by a non-programmer in less than a single day until I read this.<p>For constructive feedback, would love if you borrow an idea from Apple&#x27;s gift list. That is, categorize the products and services by topic or type. I.e. For the music lover, the hipster, painter, etc. would really go a long way once this list gets out of hand (which I suspect it will ;)",1450411230

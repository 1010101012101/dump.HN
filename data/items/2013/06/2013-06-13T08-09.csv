5872963,comment,5872002,5872320,2,0,chongli,,,"Just imagine C gave you the power to overload the semicolon operator. You could now write a series of expressions (separated by semicolons) to express other concepts (such as non-determinism, failure or state). This is scratching at the surface of what a monad does. It effectively allows you to define a context (with its own semantics) and gives you a set of powerful (overloaded) operators for working with values inside that context.<p>In Haskell, side effects are constrained to the IO monad. This allows one to see, at a glance, whether or not a particular function has the ability to perform side effects. In C, on the other hand, it could be said that all functions live in the IO monad and that no other monads exist. This makes it harder to reason about the behaviour of a function, as one does not know whether or not it will perform side effects.",1371113984

Some time ago I&#x27;ve had similar issues with a designer I hired: He wouldn&#x27;t give me vector files, only flat PNGs. He said it had to do something with his reputation.<p>Obviously, these people want you to come back rather than hire someone else if you need any changes, or additional prints later on. That&#x27;s why they only want to give you low res files. But for the customer, that&#x27;s a bit troubling. What if it turns out the photographer makes lousy prints? What if the photographer closes up shop?<p>It doesn&#x27;t matter if this is &quot;standard business practice&quot;. This attitude is typical for people who don&#x27;t take their customers&#x27; demands seriously.<p>Luckily it turns out there are plenty of professionals who care more about their customers than about their reputation.

When one thread is waiting on memory access, the core can do work on the other thread rather than sitting idle.  (Memory access isn&#x27;t <i>that</i> slow, so switches need to be fast to capture those otherwise-wasted cycles, which is why this is a CPU hardware feature rather than an OS-level software feature.)<p>Purely CPU-bound tasks [1] don&#x27;t get any performance gains from HT.  But almost all real-world applications spend a lot of time reading and writing memory, and memory access is pretty slow compared to CPU speeds, so in practice HT helps (otherwise Intel wouldn&#x27;t have bothered to develop it and put it on their chips, which probably cost a lot of money).<p>> Have you check how disabling it influences compiling speed?<p>No.  But I&#x27;d guess it would be substantially less than 100% speedup since they aren&#x27;t actual, physical cores; but substantially more than 0% speedup since the compiler uses dozens or even low hundreds of megabytes of memory.<p>[1] By &quot;CPU-bound&quot; I mean register-to-register arithmetic.

Here&#x27;s the key passage:<p>&quot;As Aaron Bady has argued in MITs Technology Review, the language and concepts for privacy evolved in a world where walls were still the dominant metaphor. Peeking through a wall was sufficient to prove you violated someones privacy. But technology has opened up a brand new world where walls no longer exist, or things exist in so many places that the idea of walls makes no sense. Without them we need new concepts.<p>As is often the case, the battle between authoritarianism and democracy can do a lot of the mental work. One of the great things about democracy is its ability to check private and government power, as well as creating institutional structure promoting accountability and transparency. And I fear it is the only way out of the situation our country faces.&quot;<p>The point is that the definition of surveillance itself is changing along with the concept of privacy, leading to shifts in previously-stable balances of power. To a very large extent, these changes - which have both positive and negative aspects - are byproducts of a larger technological shift which has already brought far to many advantages to reverse.<p>In other words, we need to develop new social norms and structures to ensure the safety of what could otherwise be  very dangerous system. We don&#x27;t have to do this from scratch, but the familiar frames of reference do need updating. And that starts with recognizing that &quot;surveillance&quot; by itself, is neither good nor bad (depending on who is watching who, under what circumstances, and why), but that it can easily be either depending on the context.",1371111680

They would follow a car, and the policeman would win if he could point out a legitimate reason for which he could make a traffic stop, if he was so inclined.<p>The officer won every time, usually within a few blocks.<p>I saw a video [1] which noted that possession of a lobster can be illegal: &quot;It doesn&#x27;t matter if he&#x27;s dead or alive.

Taking into account that in the US the &quot;initial commit&quot; is hundreds of years old [3], there are ~50 forks, and it&#x27;s still a fast-moving target, it&#x27;s not surprising that the sheer amount of complexity is more than any one person can appreciate; even after decades of study and practice, AFAIK even the best professional lawyers are basically ignorant of the law in other specializations, and even within their own specialization they sometimes need teams of lawyers and paralegals poring over legal texts to find out exactly what the law says about their particular case.<p>[1] The quote occurs at about 6:55 [2] in <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXkI4t7nuc"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXkI4t7nuc</a><p>[2] The entire video is witty and informative, and it&#x27;s something that everyone should watch at least once.<p>[3] Maybe it&#x27;s more like <i>thousands</i> of years old -- if you go back through English law, there are probably things that go back to the Norman conquest in 1066, or Roman Britain even earlier.",1371111344

Each agent had a different and unique view of the plot, but not the whole picture. The lack of communication and intel sharing between all of the various agents made it impossible to get grasp on the enormity and urgency of the situation, and so very little was done about it.<p>The book itself is a very interesting read and I highly reccommend it.",1371110804

Indeed, while human factors have been recognized in Software Engineering research, few empirical investigations have attempted to verify the claim. Development tasks are undertaken through cognitive processing abilities. Affective states  emotions, moods, and feelings - have an impact on work-related behaviors, cognitive processing activities, and the productivity of individuals. In this paper, we report an empirical study on the impact of affective states on software developers performance while programming. Two affective states dimensions are positively correlated with self-assessed productivity. We demonstrate the value of applying psychometrics in Software Engineering studies and echo a call to valorize the human, individualized aspects of software developers. We introduce and validate a measurement instrument and a linear mixed-effects model to study the correlation of affective states and the productivity of software developers. - See more at: http://figshare.com/articles/Are_Happy_Developers_More_Productive_PROFES_2013_Presentation/718138#sthash.0mHZGJrN.dpuf",1371110785

Unfortunately for the GOP, their nomination process almost guarantees that people like Huntsman, who believe that running from science is the wrong approach, are out early.<p>The Republicans need to get the Tea Party to split off and form a third party, and then run moderate Republicans. They would then be able to run candidates who don&#x27;t want to fuck the environment, massively cut science budgets, ignore climate change, put all our energy eggs in the oil basket, cut aid to the poor, and so on. This would give them candidates that align better with the majority (and more important with the directions the majority is trending). They could more than make up for the loss of the Tea Party people, I think, by getting independents and picking up some moderate Democrats.",1371110706

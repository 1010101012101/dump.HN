9842690,comment,9835655,9835655,0,0,adamtj,,,"Intentionally or not, the author has cherry-picked the data in a way that completely undermines the article.  The conclusion that &quot;lives are at stake&quot; is obviously true and supported by the data, but the implication that the US has too many guns is not.  An analysis is only as accurate as the data.  Here, the missing data makes it painfully obvious that, while we should whatever we can to reduce gun violence, we cannot morally accomplish it by disarming US citizens.<p>If you merely look back to about 1939, you would find numbers for Poland alone that dwarf any statistics for the US, even ignoring differences in population!  Poland isn&#x27;t the only such example.  Around that time, certain groups of people suffered from numerous horrific shootings, decimating their populations, despite those groups having been recently disarmed almost entirely.  Of course, I&#x27;m being sarcastic.  These people suffered at the hands of their own governments <i>because</i> they were disarmed, not despite it.  There are some still alive who remember.<p>An honest assesment of history, even very recent history, makes it clear that America&#x27;s current level of gun violence is a mere rounding error next to the real threat: descent into tyranny.  We&#x27;re lucky that we live in such a relatively peaceful time, but let us not delude ourselves.  No human will ever live without the threat of tyranny.  No government of the people or by the people will ever, by it&#x27;s own internal guidance, remain civilized indefinitely.  We must never surrender the tools needed to provide the most drastic of course corrections for a government gone astray.<p>We are fortunate that by keeping and maintaining arms, we make it <i>more</i> likely that we will never have to use them.  Armed violence is always the absolute last resort, but if we give up our last resort, we give up all the other ones too.  Speech, for example, is of little use against a tyrant with absolute power.  But speech from the mouths of well-practiced riflemen, with their weapons close at hand?  Those words cannot be safely ignored by anyone.<p>It is for this reason that the right to keep and bear arms is not unique to just the United States.  Rather, it is a fundamental and irrevokable human right.  The Constitution of the United States does not and cannot <i>grant</i> this right -- though it does explicitly <i>recognize</i> it, lest we forget.<p>Yes, gun violence is awful, and we should work hard to reduce it.  But let us not forget that is is the price we pay for a civilized society, and it is a small price compared to the alternatives.  I grow tired of articles that completely miss this point.",1436223568

Indeed, it suggests, e.g., that a major difficulty of the program to formalize all of math in set theory, Russell&#x27;s Paradox, was discovered in 1901 and then immediately notes that set theory itself was begun by Cantor decades before.<p>It also then mentions how Set Theory was formalized and fixed through the introduction of formal classes (which fixed the size concerns discovered by Russell by outlawing them---and actually Russell himself proposed a system which did exactly this, his &quot;rammified hierarchy&quot; almost immediately after discovering his paradox; it is the foundational model of the Principia Mathematica which was published in three volumes in 1910, 1912, and 1913) and that these were in use by the mid 1920s.<p>In fact, the first mention of dates in the 1930s occur in Hilbert&#x27;s finitist attempts to prove consistency and Godel&#x27;s destruction of that program.<p>What you&#x27;re probably referring to is Bourbaki&#x27;s work. This wasn&#x27;t an initial attempt by any means but instead a broad reaching program to popularize the methods of sets that had been previously established. This was the moment of catastrophic phase change when all old mathematical concepts were suddenly shown to be suspect if they could not be axiomatized set theoretically—so certainly when a bulk of work occurred.<p>But all said, it is certainly the case that set-theoretic foundations of mathematics was a 1870-1930 affair.",1436223227

9842661,comment,9842302,9842512,0,0,kelseydh,,,"No problem, here&#x27;s my two (relatively unorganized) two cents:<p>With Heroku (frankly also thanks to Ruby on Rails) I can be a sys-admin, developer, database administrator and QA all at once; far easier than before.  For the price of $100k I have seen developers build successful products that used to cost $1M+ to develop.<p>On Heroku you definitely pay for convenience and ease of use, knowing that you get a benefit in doing so by being able to focus on the development of your app, the part that matters.  The costs grow if you get traffic, but through careful management (such as packing multiple processes into one dyno), you can reduce costs.  Even if many find Heroku&#x27;s prices high, they are still much lower than what you see in enterprise land, or even on AWS if you aren&#x27;t careful.<p>Heroku&#x27;s documentation is also incredibly good, and this helps you a lot to move fast.  Almost by accident, simply by following Heroku documentation I have found that developers end up following good cloud server practices almost by default (i.e. because Heroku forces you to build your app to follow certain conventions, conventions needed for making your app horizontally scaleable; such as delegating clock processes to a separate process, and not allowing dynos to manipulate or rely on unique file memory specific only to them).<p>If I architectured or configured my own servers it would have taken 10x as long, exposed me to far more security issues, and I would have probably screwed it up any way.  The lesson from this is that I think as developers we need far less freedom to configure than we think we need.<p>So in conclusion, if you&#x27;re a small to medium-sized app that does not have complex server or bandwidth needs (i.e. you are not Imgur or Pied Piper), then I highly recommend it.  I&#x27;m sure many Oracle salesman will be unhappy with this opinion, but take my word for it that the vast majority of applications do not need complex, overengineered server systems to be successful.  (After all as a startup, you should not be wasting months planning on how you will scale to support 10 million concurrent users.  I&#x27;ve seen that hubris distract failing startups before.)",1436223039

It was thought, even up to the time of the Columbia disaster, that the reinforced carbon-carbon composites on the wing leading edges were too strong to take damage from a foam/ice strike. And there were contingencies in place for foam damage, though the system was overall resilient enough to take a fair bit of damage without causing a loss of the vehicle during re-entry. So to some extent they thought they had their bases covered, though in reality that was just a fantasy. The reality was that it was extremely difficult to assess any damage to the thermal protective system while on orbit, there weren&#x27;t actually any feasible options for repairs of major damage, there weren&#x27;t proper contingencies for a rescue operation except when the orbiter visited the station (and then only just barely), and the wing leading edge material turned out to be far more brittle than had been modeled.<p>The whole history of the Shuttle system is a history of dodging disaster left and right and then hitting it after leaning too heavily on luck for too long. The very first flight of the Shuttle involved an &quot;anomaly&quot; during launch which the crew said would have resulted in them attempting to ditch if they had known about it during liftoff. On the 9th shuttle flight there was a leak and fire of two out of three of the APUs right at touchdown. Had that happened much earlier during entry it could have easily resulted in loss of the crew and vehicle. Not to mention the many near-misses with the problem that ultimately doomed Challenger.",1436220452

Liberal values include state housing which is proven time and time again to end mass homelessness at a smaller cost than the law enforcement, judicial and social cost of managing homeless populations. Liberal values strongly support taking from the rich to support the poor, including the mentally ill and homeless. You do not see many liberal values at play here.<p>It&#x27;s pretty ridiculous to say that when in democrat-controlled areas (I will strip the political posturing from the &quot;liberal&quot;/&quot;conservative&quot; weasel words to the teams they refer to, democrats and republicans) there is still plenty of homelessness, very little state housing, and plenty of law enforcement.<p>DC has been controlled by democrats for decades, as has Chicago, and I know DC has been having a great time selling off homeless shelters so developers can keep gentrification rolling.<p>Pretending that the other team is responsible for all the world&#x27;s ills is so juvenile.

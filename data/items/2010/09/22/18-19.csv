1717154,comment,1716829,1716829,0,0,parfe,,,"Cyclists and Motorcycle riders are most often killed by the oncoming left turn.  It's one of the most dangerous scenarios for a rider as you cannot react until it's nearly too late.   If you see a driver doing something stupid (like speed past you with the right turn blinker on) you can slow down and allow them to make a right turn and avoid a collision.<p>A car slowing to make a left on the other hand looks like a driver acting properly.  Slowly to a stop... waiting for cars to pass.... waiting for yo... and then the driver jerks the wheel and speeds across attempting to beat the next oncoming car.  Turns out you're trapped halfway across the intersection with a 3000 lb vehicle crossing your T.<p>Or worse yet they just assume you're going to yield to them because you're on a bike.  In that case, no amount of visibility will change the fact the other driver hasn't ridden a bicycle in 30 years and has forgotten the rules of the road.<p>Riding a motorcycle creates another issue in that drivers have trouble immediately identifying something small oncoming at twice the speed limit (relative).  You end up with a dead rider and a driver confused because they saw the motorcycle, but their subconscious driving habits were not trained to deal with it properly.   I think that is called beta reaction? e.g. absentmindedly braking when you see a red light without consciously connecting the red light with stopping.<p><i>6. In the multiple vehicle accidents, the driver of the other vehicle violated the motorcycle right-of-way and caused the accident in two-thirds of those accidents.</i><p><i>7. The failure of motorists to detect and recognize motorcycles in traffic is the predominating cause of motorcycle accidents. The driver of the other vehicle involved in collision with the motorcycle did not see the motorcycle before the collision, or did not see the motorcycle until too late to avoid the collision.</i><p><i>8. Deliberate hostile action by a motorist against a motorcycle rider is a rare accident cause. The most frequent accident configuration is the motorcycle proceeding straight then the automobile makes a left turn in front of the oncoming motorcycle.</i><p>source: <a href=""http://www.motorcycle-accidents.com/pages/stats.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.motorcycle-accidents.com/pages/stats.html</a><p>PDF of Study: <a href=""http://isddc.dot.gov/OLPFiles/NHTSA/013695.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://isddc.dot.gov/OLPFiles/NHTSA/013695.pdf</a>",1285181987

They have a very nice introduction to App Engine. [2]<p>Then once you've played with it, and deployed your first 'hello world' program, you can search github for small projects which run on App Engine.

Then go learn about Ruby [4]. And see how it compares to python. Write a bunch of ruby scripts, install sinatra [5], deploy to Heroku [6]. Now, try to write the same simple and fun service you've previously written in Python in Ruby. Then go read about other scripting languages (javascript, PHP) and once you've made your mind about which one you prefer, stick with it for a few months.<p>You can learn and deploy sites/apps without spending a cent.<p>[1] <a href=""http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/python/gettingstarted/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/python/gettingstarted/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/python/gettingstarted/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/python/gettingstarted/</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://github.com/search?langOverride=&language=python&q=appengine&start_value=1&type=Repositories"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/search?langOverride=&language=python&#...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://mislav.uniqpath.com/poignant-guide/book/chapter-3.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mislav.uniqpath.com/poignant-guide/book/chapter-3.htm...</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://www.sinatrarb.com/intro"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sinatrarb.com/intro</a><p>[6] <a href=""http://blog.heroku.com/archives/2009/3/5/32_deploy_merb_sinatra_or_any_rack_app_to_heroku/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.heroku.com/archives/2009/3/5/32_deploy_merb_sina...</a>",1285181228

One of my local curry houses gives discounts to Arsenal season ticket holders. Nobody should feel _obliged_ to make these concessions, but when many companies do makes sense for nonprofits to ask the question.

If there are not the user should at least be able to adjust the number of characters in a line.<p>Don’t justify without hyphenation. Never justify monospaced typefaces.<p>Use a single space between sentences.<p>Don’t letterspace lower case.<p>Pick an appropriate line height. The default is nearly always too small, especially for body text. Increase it but don’t break it.<p>Use the non-breaking space for mathematical and numerical expressions (like 4 cm).<p>Use hyphens, dashes and quotes correctly.

They have the cool and fast technology of both Sun's JVM and BEA's JVM (JRockit). They have acquired other brilliant technologies, and have in practice endless resources to acquire more: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_acquisitions_by_Oracle"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_acquisitions_by_Oracle</a> <a href=""http://www.oracle.com/us/corporate/acquisitions/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.oracle.com/us/corporate/acquisitions/index.html</a><p>But... although it's simple to appreciate the advantages of combining technologies, it's very very hard to actually do. For example, the IBM 360 project, of a series of machines of increasing power (and price), that were all compatible, so customers could upgrade, is a simple idea. But implementing this was a bet-the-company project, it was celebrated as an incredible, miraculous achievement, and the lessons learnt from it remain popular to this day (<i>The Mythical Man Month</i>, by the leader of the 360 project, Fred Brooks.)<p>To pull off these technical feats, you need the public superstar developers, but also the hidden superstar developers (the x100 coders; the people who, after working closely with them for a while, you observe, oh that guy's a genius); and then the x10 coders, who want to hang out with the geniuses and learn from them. It's places like HP used to be, where Woz wanted to work, at almost all costs (Woz himself being a x100 guy.)<p>If you only have x5 or x7 coders; and if you don't support them (with infrastructure, secretarial etc - not just compensation, adequate  decision-making power, and some kind of recognition.), then, well, you can't do these technical feats. You may seek but not find; ask but it shall not be given; knock but it shall not be opened. Though this is not a disruptive issue, the same factors occur of the difficulty for an established successful company to change its culture and business architecture.

Sometimes they fail. But due to their huge install base and lock-in effects and user inertia and huge cash pile they have the ability to muddle onward. In some ways, Microsoft treats Apple as a sort of external UI R&D department, one with the wonderful quality that Microsoft doesn't have to pay the Apple folks anything, just copy whatever people seem to like. I do think they succeed enough, at the right things, that it keeps them shambling forward. But the same is true of a zombie.",1293015162

2030994,comment,2030853,2030853,0,0,tzs,,,"This looks absolutely trivial to work around. The claims require a ""geofence"" at a <i>user-defined</i> distance from a user-selected location, requires that geofence be sent to a server along with the device location, and requires the server to determine if the location is within the geofence.<p>So, first way to work around. Do not let the user define the distance of the geofence from the user-defined location. Use a fixed distance, larger than any reasonable distance the user would care about. The server returns all events inside that geofence, and the device filters it down to a user-defined distance.<p>Second work around. Do not send the device location to the server. Just send the region enclosed by the geofence (which can be used-defined). Let the device decide whether or not the current location is within the geofence.",1293012934

2030983,comment,2025286,2029199,0,0,cookiecaper,,,"People always say this, but in the United States, T-Mobile is the only carrier that even has any alternate options. Everyone else doesn't discount your rate; you pay the same whether you buy a phone outright or buy on subsidy. Buying outright simply prevents a two-year contract (where the early termination fee is usually cheaper than the sticker price for the phone). There's no reason not to buy without subsidy unless you use T-Mobile.<p>T-Mobile offers a couple of different options, one of which is a $10-$20 discount on the monthly plan for non-contract phones, or a zero-interest amortized 24-month payment plan that allows you to still get the subsidy and the discounted plan. To me, not having to drop $500 to get a phone when I don't have $500 is worth $10-$20/mo (which, over two years, depending on the phone you get and the price you pay with contract, is usually pretty close to the sticker price for the phone anyway, maybe +$100-$200 than buying outright, a reasonable finance charge), and I didn't know about the payment plan when I signed up, though it's generally been agreed that that turns out to be the best option.",1293012172

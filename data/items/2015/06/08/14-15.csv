9679489,comment,9679085,9679301,0,0,drzaiusapelord,,,">you need hard documentation and evidence.<p>How is anything Snowden released hard evidence? Every single thing Snowden released could have easily been faked. Hell, those powerpoints look fake. Who thought an intelligence agency would use something straight out of the world of TPS reporting and cookie-cutter presentation templates? Note, I&#x27;m not saying they&#x27;re fake, but it would be trivial for someone to make this stuff if they wanted. So the argument that there&#x27;s this overwhelming proof that the public can&#x27;t ignore seems like weak sauce to me. The public isn&#x27;t terribly interested in hard proof (or have the time/expertise to weigh claims), historically. If they were, we&#x27;d probably be a society of hard atheists scoffing at anything that can&#x27;t be trivially proven in the lab.<p>The real issue here is why certain things go viral and others don&#x27;t. Snowden&#x27;s fleeing was fairly dramatic and I&#x27;m assuming that helped get the ball rolling.  The timed release aspect of his disclosures are fairly clever too.  Frankly, I think Assange cut a path for him by normalizing this type of leak and the journalist/news system was ready for it.  In the past, this system was too busy avoiding these issues, or worse, being a mouthpiece for the current administration (See the NYTimes&#x27; disgraceful Iraq pre-war reporting, repeating Bush admin propaganda without question.)<p>Without the Assange/Manning path, the previous whistleblowers only received marginalized exposure.  Now news managers realize how profitable leaks are especially with the White House not reciprocating with the &#x27;blocking of access.&#x27; Obama&#x27;s more liberal direction probably guarantees more leaks in his terms.  We&#x27;ll see how things are with the next POTUS. I suspect a GOP POTUS won&#x27;t be as forgiving as the Bush administration has shown (Valerie Plame/Wilson affair for example).",1433775583

It&#x27;s not a big deal in a thousand line program, but as things grow, the need to <i>always</i> remember to check for null becomes a real problem.<p>Related to null, you only get one null. the classic assoc problem. if i lookup a key in a hash, does the hash have the key, or is they value of the key null? Optional/Maybe is just wonderful for this case.<p>Semantic meaning of common types.<p><pre><code>    update(String name, String email, String address, ...)\n</code></pre>\nvs<p><pre><code>    update(Name name, Email email, Address address, ...)\n</code></pre>\nStrings get overloaded for lots of uses, and it&#x27;s so easy to swap the order when you have multiple arguments.<p>Status codes, stuff like Email vs VerifiedEmail. Encoding those random flags in types makes it so much easier to enforce rules.<p>Yes, they are all &quot;easy&quot;, but we&#x27;ve all lost hours or days to those problems. The sooner we can stop worrying about bonehead, forgot to check for null errors, the sooner we can concentrate on real problems. They&#x27;re trivial problems, but we waste a big fraction of our lives dealing with them. Just taking those issues off the table makes it <i>possible</i> for average programmers to find bugs in timsort. The cognitive load of these dozens of details detracts from average programmers (like me) ability to actually detect the hard cases.<p>Typing isn&#x27;t a panacea, but it is a help.

Contract law itself, and in particular for civil law, the underlying theory is that a contract is a meeting of the mind where both parties understand what kind of responsibility and obligation there is.

He donated a large sum of money to actively (and <i>successfully</i> for a time) strip his coworkers of their legal rights.  Not only did his position on marriage not change, but he expressed no regret over the actual, tangible harm that he helped to cause to his numerous gay and lesbian coworkers. It doesn&#x27;t sound quite as soft when you put it that way.<p>There was no big ruckus when he was the CTO for the Mozilla Foundation, either. But when you become the CEO of an organization, you become its public face in many ways.  And he had some baggage, there. Like it or not, many corporate CEOs are held to different standards of public discourse by their employers, because companies generally don&#x27;t want to risk alienating consumers.<p>Now, I don&#x27;t know that it was right for him to lose his job. That was probably the wrong thing to happen at this point in time. I have big problems with companies being able to exercise control over people&#x27;s expression of their political beliefs and actions. I feel bad for him losing the position, I really do. On the other hand, if he was not going to be able to effectively run the foundation and there were schisms forming in the community that&#x27;s so essential to the continuation of the foundation&#x27;s work...what are you, as Mozilla, to do?<p>I mean, if you had a corporate leader who came out publicly and said, &quot;I don&#x27;t think mixed race couples should be allowed to marry,&quot; she or he probably would not last much longer in that position.

In fact, I don&#x27;t have to bet about a situation like that — nobody shed too many tears for Donald Sterling.<p>It&#x27;s a complicated issue. I&#x27;d strongly suggest reading (or listening) to the things that Dan Savage and Andrew Sullivan (both gay writers with very different political bents) had to say afterwards. Savage pointed out, very interestingly, that this ouster, while pinned on the &quot;gay mafia&quot;, was really something that came from other large tech companies, from online journalistic enterprises, and from inside Mozilla itself. It may just be the first pang of society saying, &quot;Bigotry against gay people is not socially acceptable, just like many other forms of bigotry.&quot; Again, like it or not, society does this all the time. See, again, Donald Sterling for a case study in it.",1433775373

9679440,comment,9677896,9677896,0,0,michaelochurch,,,"This is intelligently argued and articulate but the content is a bit lacking.<p>First, Paul Graham isn&#x27;t an expert on languages. He wrote a decent Lisp book, years ago. Relative to VCs, he&#x27;s a technical genius. Relative to technical geniuses, he&#x27;s a VC. I respect him for taking iconoclastic positions against the Establishment, and I miss that Paul Graham, but... he has serious blind spots when it comes to, say, statically typed languages.<p>Now, PG probably intended &quot;Blub&quot; to mean a mediocre language <i>du jour</i> like C++ (in the early 1990s) or Java (since the late &#x27;90s) but Blub is more of an attitude than a language. Yes, there really are one-language programmers who can&#x27;t think out of a specific paradigm. They exist, and they&#x27;re the ones who write FactoryVisitorFactory classes because they haven&#x27;t been exposed to functional programming and the right way of solving certain problems. That said, there are cases where C or Java is the absolute right language to use. Not many, for Java, but they exist. Not everyone who uses those &quot;Blub languages&quot; is a mediocre programmer; Java is not always Blub, and C is definitely not always Blub (in fact, it&#x27;s out of fashion among the Blubanistas, who avoid low level programming because &quot;it&#x27;s too hard&quot;.)<p>As for &quot;Flub&quot;... I don&#x27;t even know where to begin. Just going to snipe specific points.<p><i>&#x27;Power&#x27; and &#x27;Expressiveness&#x27; turn out to be separate concepts. In the end, there is no simple continuum that you can use to line programming languages up, nose to tail, feeble to awesome.</i><p>I agree with this, whole-heartedly. Assembly and C, I would argue, are more powerful than Haskell because it makes it so much easier to create custom control flows and to manage memory explicitly. Haskell is more expressive. You trade some power, in exchange for a language that allows you to write very robust code, very quickly. But sometimes you need that power and C is the best option.<p><i>To use it effectively, however, requires using an IDE, and Flubbists hate IDEs, partly because their finger muscle memory has been overspecialized from spending too much time in Eighties power editors, but also because using an IDE is too closely associated with Blub practices.</i><p>No, we dislike IDEs (actually, we don&#x27;t; we dislike broken languages and codebases that require us to use IDEs) because it&#x27;s a lot easier to keep flow when you&#x27;re using the keyboard only. Switching to the mouse to recompile breaks flow.<p>IDEs also have a stigma because they&#x27;re most useful when you&#x27;re maintaining other peoples&#x27; code, which generally is a disliked sort of work given to juniors. So, IDEs tend to be associated with the second-class programmers who spend most of their time on maintenance work. I, personally, think the &quot;reading code is for losers&quot; attitude that many programmers cop is stupid and counterproductive.

Facebook dominated its market - using PHP - which everyone agrees is crap. Google built up the world&#x27;s biggest advertising agency using Java and C++; Android is a Java-like ecosystem that runs in most pockets these days.</i><p>Oh, this shitty argument. &quot;Your tech should be boring, your product should be interesting.&quot; Yawn. It&#x27;s a bullshit argument and I&#x27;ll tackle it another time.<p>Google was originally written in <i>Python</i>, which was more of a reach than Haskell is now. Python sucked in 1998. Also, the late &#x27;90s were a time when PL was considered to be a dead field, so PL never worked its way into Google&#x27;s DNA and it&#x27;s stayed that way. They use C++ because it was the best choice in the late 1990s, and they tolerate Java in the context of acquisitions, and when they tried to come up with their own language... the best they could do is Go.<p>Facebook started on PHP but is increasingly innovative on the language front, with Erlang, Ocaml, and Haskell getting a presence.<p><i>You put a group of merely good Lisp programmers on a project, and embed them in a corporate environment, and the stellar results are likely to be not reproducible. (I don&#x27;t doubt they will be more productive than Java programmers. But will the result blend?)</i><p>&quot;Will it blend?&quot; I&#x27;m sorry, but I prefer not to think of my work as something that will be ground to a pulp. If that&#x27;s the kind of work you want, then hire a Scrum drone, not someone like me.<p><i>Big companies understand this problem well, and prefer Blub programmers, who are easier to source and come with less attitude.</i><p>False. Do Haskell programmers come with more &quot;attitude&quot; than mediocre Java programmers? Yeah, there&#x27;s probably a slight difference. However, the problem isn&#x27;t &quot;Haskell programmers&quot; or &quot;Java programmers&quot; but <i>people</i>. People are just a pain in the ass: all of us, to some degree. Since you need 30 Java programmers to do the work of 5 Haskell programmers, you not only have more sources of &quot;attitude&quot; with the 30, but you have more politics and less per-person productivity on account of the larger team.",1433775233

The typical state lottery in most parts of the United States has parimutuel pay-outs for winning tickets, meaning that if multiple purchasers have winning numbers, they split the prize in a way that ensures that the lottery doesn&#x27;t pay out more money than was bet for that drawing. An example from Britain was a national lottery that had something like seventy-six different winners, who all bet on the same &quot;lucky&quot; number that happened to be drawn in that drawing. They split the prize equally, so that each bettor&#x27;s individual winnings from a large prize were not particularly large. The number may have been lucky in the sense that it matched the drawn number on that one occasion, but the number wasn&#x27;t INDIVIDUALLY lucky for each person who bet it.<p>Over and over and over, some people have winning tickets, but most people have losing tickets. When a lottery is structured in the typical parimutuel way, as most lotteries are, even if you buy all the tickets available for sale in the next drawing, which takes a big investment, you can&#x27;t be sure of winning a full prize individually, because other bettors may have a collision with your choice of a winning ticket number. tl;dr: A bug in one state lottery game was discovered by MIT students, who invested in exploiting the bug until the game was closed.",1433774685

The way I see it-<p>Advantages:<p>. Flash memories (specially NAND) are dart cheap these days. And if Microsoft decides to go for it, NOR memories won’t remain expensive given the volume of the OS Microsoft sells.<p>. Microsoft is losing significant amount of money to the hackers and crackers. And OS in chip only solution will force the customers buy the OS.<p>. OS hack will be significantly more difficult, if not impossible. Custom design of the chip will make hacking infeasible.<p>. Loading OS from flash to RAM will require significantly less time.<p>. Unique hardware identity per cheap (Apple’s iPhone 5s+ like) along with crypto engine will make the users and their data more secure.<p>Possible solutions:<p>. RAM Slot: OS in a RAM slot comes to my mind first. A RAM stick can have the OS along with RAM chips. Users plug and play the OS. No more hassle to install OS. It will ensure OS license/user.<p>. Single chip: Single chip containing flash memory, cryptography engine, MCU and RAM for data and OS update/upgrade management will be shipped with the motherboards of the devices. It will ensure OS license/machine.<p>. BIOS replacement: replacing the decades old BIOS with a full fledge OS chip makes sense in terms of dynamic hardware detection, and security of the system.<p>What&#x27;s the catch?",1433774642

9679242,comment,9677758,9677758,0,0,pron,,,"The question of computation vs. interaction is an fascinating one, but I think there&#x27;s another question (perhaps related) to the applicability of &quot;rich&quot; types to practical programming, and that is regarding the role of types, and how far they <i>should</i> be stretched. I think there is little question that &quot;simple&quot; type systems (like in C/C++/Java/C#) aid in developing large systems. But much of the fascination with type theory (as the article states) has to do with the Curry-Howard isomorphism, and the ability of programs to carry proofs to some of their properties. This is believed to be a powerful tool in software verification. The question then becomes to what extent should this tool be used? What properties <i>can</i> be proven? What properties programmers are willing to try and prove? How much harder is it to prove a property than write a possibly-incorrect algorithm without proof?<p>The benefit of proofs in code would only be worthwhile if it was relatively easy for common programmers to prove the absence of bugs that would have been more costly to find and fix using other methods, and that that ease would not come at the cost of other properties (such as performance). So far I have a feeling that this is not being delivered. Your run-of-the-mill clever use of types usually prevents very &quot;cheap&quot; bugs, and hard bugs are even harder to prevent with types.<p>I&#x27;ll give a concrete and recent real-world example. A few months ago, a bug was discovered in Python&#x27;s and Java&#x27;s sequential sorting algorithm[1], Timsort. It was introduced to Python in 2002, and its adoption by Java in 2011 has probably made it the most used sorting algorithm in the world. Yet, it contained a fatal bug that could cause it to crash by overflowing an array. There are a few interesting observations one could make about the bug and its discovery with relation to type systems.<p>1. The bug was discovered by a verification program that does not rely on type-based proofs in the code. The output from the verification system quickly showed where the bug actually was. AFAIK, the verification program required no assistance with proving the correctness of the algorithm, only that the variants the algorithm seeks to maintain be stated.<p>2. Proving the invariants required by the (rather complicated) algorithm with types would have required dependent types, and would have probably been a lot harder than using the verification program used. It is also unclear (to me) whether the problem and the fix would have been so immediately apparent.<p>3. The interaction of &quot;type-proofs&quot; with program semantics (namely, the requirement of referential transparency) would have made the type-proven algorithm much slower, and this particular algorithm was chosen just for its speed.<p>4. The corrected version ended up not being used because it could have adversely affected performance, and it was noticed that the &quot;incorrect&quot; algorithm with a slightly larger internal array would still always produce correct results for the input sizes currently supported in Java.<p>This example of a purely computational real-world bug shows some more limitations of the type-system approach to verification, I think.<p>Going back to effects and interactions, pure-FP approaches have a hard time dealing with timing properties. I already gave the same example on another discussion today, but the Esterel language (and languages influenced by it) has been used successfully to write 100% verifiable programs for safety-critical domains in the industry for a long time now. It is an imperative language (though it&#x27;s not Turing complete) with side effects and a lot of interactions, yet it has a verifier that uses Pnueli&#x27;s temporal logic to guarantee behavior, without requiring the programmer to supply proofs.<p>To summarize, type systems have shown their usefulness in reducing the cost of software development, but they need to be considered as a component in a larger verification space, and they need to strike a balance between usefulness and ease of use.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.envisage-project.eu/proving-android-java-and-python-sorting-algorithm-is-broken-and-how-to-fix-it/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.envisage-project.eu/proving-android-java-and-pyth...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://www.envisage-project.eu/key-deductive-verification-of-software/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.envisage-project.eu/key-deductive-verification-of...</a>",1433773474

More accurate would be: <i>&quot;the effectiveness of a programming language is driven by multi-dimensional factors instead of a single factor such as expressiveness of syntax.  One&#x27;s expert usage of a language can lead him to overestimate its overall effectiveness.&quot;</i><p>When people debate programming languages using words like <i>&quot;simple&quot;</i>, <i>&quot;powerful&quot;</i>, <i>&quot;better&quot;</i>, it&#x27;s not very precise.  It&#x27;s actually misleading.  All those labels have multidimensional factors <i>but people discuss them as if they are a single dimension scalar</i>.<p>E.g. &quot;<i>Golang is simple</i>&quot; -- it&#x27;s simple in keyword count but <i>not simple</i> in terms of implementing a family of algorithms  that differ only by type.  The paradox of &quot;simple&quot; has contradictory conclusions because that word has multiple dimensions.  Therefore, if one&#x27;s <i>typical</i> use case of Go does not involve templated algorithms, it is perceived as &quot;simple&quot; and one would proceed to evangelize the language as &quot;simple.&quot;<p>Same type of analysis can be done for words like &quot;power&quot;, &quot;better&quot;, &quot;easier&quot;, etc.<p>Yes, languages like Haskell/Lisp/Ocaml/F# etc have more expressive syntax but there are other dimensions in creating software that can overwhelm that advantage.  This is why PG can have reasonable opinion on the &quot;power&quot; of Lisp but Aaron Schwartz came to a different reasonable opinion[1] and determined Python in his case to be more appropriate for Reddit.  Aaron was not stupid and he knew how to write Lisp.  To understand Aaron&#x27;s viewpoint, you have to notice that he&#x27;s using different dimensions of the word &quot;better&quot;.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/rewritingreddit"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/rewritingreddit</a>",1433773408

They also made a commitment to take it back if you don&#x27;t pay (and you&#x27;ve paid for that privilege, perhaps dearly.)<p>Student loans are a bit different because some interest rates are heavily subsidized (some are not).  If you&#x27;re paying a high interest rate, then you are paying for someone to accept the risk of not getting paid back.  Default, they get punished, they stop making bad loans, the market corrects.<p>Instead we&#x27;ve jammed a penny in the circuit breaker and loans must always be available and are near impossible to discharge.  Government backs or bails lenders out and nobody gets punished for contributing to the mess (and driving up prices for cash payers too).<p><i>edit</i> tldnr -- Loans are not priced based on moral commitment to them.  If you get a loan priced as such (interest free from a friend) honor that commitment.  If you pay extra for the inherent risk, let the risk taking parties honor their commitment, too.",1433772666

But also fire the person quickly if it seems like they won&#x27;t be a good fit. After spending years interviewing people, this is the best conclusion I&#x27;ve come up with, because nothing else works as conclusively. Yes, it&#x27;s brutal, and a bit ruthless, but effective. Whiteboard interview questions are a terrible measure of whether someone will be able to contribute. Same goes for the other types of interview questions.<p>Of course, you need to give the person a chance to ramp up, etc, but if they can&#x27;t be a contributing team member in 2 months, then it&#x27;s better to give them 1-2 month&#x27;s severance and get rid of them.

9679080,comment,9677896,9678439,0,0,wz1000,,,"> Haskell is a good example of how you can overdo it, with the best intentions: concepts that are beautiful and frictionless in pure math become a cumbersome burden and an impractical cognitive load when translated too directly into a PL.<p>Why do you say this?<p>Sure, Haskell is radically different from most programming languages out there, even ones that claim to be &#x27;functional&#x27;. But that does not mean it is &#x27;overdone&#x27;.<p>With traditional imperative languages, you have years of experience behind you. Anytime you see a problem, you have those years of experience to guide you in choosing an appropriate way of solving it. All those idioms that you learn over decades of programming add up.<p>The problem with Haskell is that because it is so radically different, all that experience is largely useless. You start again from scratch. Remember the first time you learnt how to drive. It was confusing and you paid a lot of attention on every action and every turn. Eventually, with experience, it becomes instinctive and you don&#x27;t even <i>think</i> about it under normal circumstances. Now, imagine that you wake up tomorrow, with all of that instinct gone. It would be utterly disorienting and scary.<p>Now, time for an anecdote: I&#x27;ve spent the bulk of the past one and a half years learning Haskell, with a couple of years of experience with other, partly &#x27;functional&#x27; languages like Scheme and Python. In the beginning, I was extremely confused, and whenever I came across a problem, I had <i>no idea</i> of how to express myself in Haskell. This was completely alien to me. No other language I had come across had left me so lost.<p>However, in a few months, I came to learn functional idioms and began to grasp the language. What really appealed to me was how expressive the language was once you knew how to &quot;speak&quot; it. If you have to become &#x27;fluent&#x27; in anything, you have use and think in it repeatedly. Eventually, it becomes second nature.<p>Because of how so many things in Haskell are based on solid mathematical foundations, it is extremely easy to generalize and most importantly, <i>compose</i>. Haskellers tend to draw a lot of inspiration from category theory(which I&#x27;ve also taken a liking too). The essence of the concept of &quot;composition&quot; is a category. It often astounds me how simple, generic functions and combinators can be strung together to form complex programs. I haven&#x27;t come across this level of generality and composability in any other programming language.<p>Programming in Haskell, once you learn to &quot;speak&quot; it, reduces cognitive burden by a huge margin. Often, you deal with concepts so general there is only one way to implement them. You don&#x27;t have to care about details of the underlying representation, because the number of representations is extremely vast. This is initially extremely disconcerting, and is probably the reason why people face so many problems with monads. The concept is so general, and has no single &quot;concrete representation&quot; that would make you grok it. When you ask &quot;what is a monad?&quot;, people answer in a vast variety of ways. In truth, the only <i>correct</i> way to describe a monad is the monad laws. Anything that follows the monad laws is a monad. Those three laws are <i>it</i>. Newcomers are often astounded by that. How can that be <i>it</i>? The laws don&#x27;t really say anything! They <i>can&#x27;t</i> say much because they can be used to describe a vast number of things, from IO to exception handling to parallelism to non determinism. When you write code for a generic monad, you don&#x27;t care about any of those detail, and what the monad you are dealing with actually <i>is</i>. All that cognitive burden is thrown away. In the beginning, it seems scary, but after a while I realised how liberating it actually was.",1433772131

Upon which I find the thesis sorely lacking, if you accept the principle as discussed in the comments that it&#x27;s OK for research to be &quot;wasteful&quot; as long as &quot;1%&quot; of it turns out to be useful, especially in the long term (e.g. I do not accept that all interesting computing is going to limited to the context of the current context of the cloud and supercomputers masquerading as smart phones (&quot;mobile&quot;; I started my computing career in 1977, when the 90 MHz Cray 1 was the pinnacle of number crunching, although I have to confess that I don&#x27;t know the 64 bit floating point performance of typical smartphone ARM CPUs)).<p>More specifically, his criticism of Haskell seems to be misplaced by his criteria of developing useful software, if you accept that the seL4 microkernel is useful, which I gather it is, otherwise General Dynamics et. al. are wasting money.

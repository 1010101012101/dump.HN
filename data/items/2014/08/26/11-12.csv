Guix is built on top of Nix but replaces the custom package configuration language with Scheme, among other differences. <a href=""https://gnu.org/software/guix/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gnu.org/software/guix/</a><p>Personally, I&#x27;m rather more keen on Nix; the language is pretty much designed for writing JSON-style configuration except as a formal programming language, which is what the vast majority of Nix code is (both package definitions and system configurations).<p>Additionally, with Nix, you can be close to certain that if you build something twice, you&#x27;ll get the same result, because it can&#x27;t access impure resources.<p>Finally, because Guix is a GNU project, the official repositories are going to go nowhere near non-free software. Nixpkgs contains non-free software, although disabled from installation by default. You might be a little less likely to have people help you get non-free software working on the GNU Guix mailing lists, if you happen to use any.",1409054270

8226618,comment,8224412,8226348,1,0,dredmorbius,,,"When you ask for solutions, the first thing to be clear about is what the question is.  I was addressing the matter of the study and understanding of <i>economics</i> rather than of <i>the economic system</i> itself, though both are pretty profoundly troubled.<p>For the first, I think adopting a systems approach as suggested by <i>Limits to Growth</i> would be a good start, and find the writings of ecological economists (Odum, Daly, Hall) to be superior to most of the orthodxy, with Hall perhaps among the most rigorous.<p>In terms of the economic system itself:  I don&#x27;t see a solution to the present crisis.  There are too many people, consuming too many resources, and yet we want to increase both values.  There&#x27;s a simple formula that was derived in the 1970s that describes this:  I = P x A x T<p>Impacts is equal to population times affluence (material resource utilization per capita) time technology.<p>Alternatively:  k <= S x A x P<p>Sustainability x Affluence x Population is subject to a maximal constraint k.<p>Which means that you can optimize at best any two of the three.  Your choices are high affluence and large population, but low sustainability.  High population and high sustainability but low affluence.  Or high affluence and high sustainability, but low population.<p>Or of course, optimizing for at most one or zero aspects.<p>The &quot;solutions&quot; in this case involve deciding reducing population, accepting crushing poverty (as existed for much of human history), or wipe ourselves out.<p>I&#x27;m not predicting an imminent collapse of the global order, but things could turn south on relatively short notice.  More likely this is a scenario which will play out over decades, possibly a couple of centuries paralleling the rise of human population following the Industrial Revolution.<p>Economic growth has to top out at some point, simply due to physical planetary limits.  And no, we&#x27;re not going to overcome those any time soon, if ever.  Even <i>planetary</i> space travel is tremendously expensive, let alone interstellar travel.  And there are <i>multiple</i> things we&#x27;d have to solve to address near-term challenges, with energy, phosphorus, other minerals, soil, and fresh water chief among them.  Look up Leibig&#x27;s Law of the Minimum -- any one constraint is sufficient to limit growth, and we&#x27;re facing many.<p>Your past civilizations and empires weren&#x27;t global in scope and yet even their falls typically precipitated long periods of darkness.  And yes, life for much of human history was pretty interesting, in a Chinese curse sense of the word.<p>The solution in a nutshell?  A man (or all humans) have got to know their limits.",1409054100

In my experience that&#x27;s not the case <i>at all</i>. Money and tech are important, but the marketing and strategy are equally, if not more, important. You can build the best tech in the world, but without marketing and sales to get it to customers it&#x27;s worth zero. Don&#x27;t be so quick to discount your friend&#x27;s marketing/strategy input.<p>As for the $100k you&#x27;d be losing, it&#x27;s an opportunity cost of doing this startup. As far as the other people involved are concerned it&#x27;s not relevant to them, so there&#x27;s no reason why they should compensate you for it. After all, you might have an offer to work for the next year at $100,000,000 - would that mean they need to be offering you more equity because you&#x27;d be giving that up? No. The value you represent to the startup doesn&#x27;t change. You alone have to work out whether or not the deal on the table is enough compensation for what you&#x27;ll &#x27;lose&#x27;. If it&#x27;s not enough compared to what you could get elsewhere renegotiate or turn the deal down, but don&#x27;t expect them to &#x27;overpay&#x27; (in their mind) for what you&#x27;ll bring to the table simply because of what you could earn somewhere else.<p>All that said though, it seems odd to me that the group have left so little equity for the technical founder.

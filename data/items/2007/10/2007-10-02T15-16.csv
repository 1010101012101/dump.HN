I still had the image of one big Nerd Summer Camp that happened to spit out companies and connections.

62050,comment,61762,61965,0,0,Goladus,,,"One recommendation I have (in spite of PG's essay) is that if you take a course in Classics or ""Western Humanities"" as it was called at my college, take it from a Philosophy professor.  <p>I might have just been lucky, but they always had the most interesting discussion and criticism of the stuff we were reading.  One of the best discussions about the scientific method I've ever had came from in a Humanities class taught by a philosophy prof.  One of the first things we read was Galileo's letters on sunspots.  Later in the semester we demonstrated how Freud's theories were completely unscientific (because they were unfalsifiable/untestable).  I actually never <i>really</i> understood the difference between axioms and theorems until I took that class.  I mean, I knew vaguely that an axiom was a rule and a theorem was a confirmed hypothesis, but the fact that axioms are essentially arbitrary never really sunk in.  In actual science classes I was always too busy learning details to think about the abstract stuff.

62048,comment,61922,61922,0,0,edw519,,,"""...I don't want to bury anyone else's reputation...""<p>That's not for you to decide.  If what they did was unethical, then you have a responsibility to share.  If it wasn't, then anything you say won't matter anyway.<p>I place ethics more important than anything else when considering partners.  WAY more important that skill, work ethic, or connections.  Take it from someone who has been burned more than once by lying, cheating, stealing, and backroom deals that my partners thought were ""no big deal"".  F*ck 'em.  They'll never get a second chance with me.  Never.<p>You're probably tempted to say nothing so you don't offend.  Don't.  Spare the rest of the community the same potential headache and tell the whole story.<p>(Personally, if someone tried to poach my partner, only one of us would leave the room alive.  This isn't a game anymore.)

10781582,comment,10779592,10779592,0,0,tptacek,,,"The ACLU and EFF seem clearly to be in the right here, and the district court ruling seems pretty straightforward. Here&#x27;s a quick sketch of the facts of the case:<p>* The plaintiff is a serial child molester, convicted once in the late 80s, again in the 90s (for which he served a 10-year sentence), paroled in the early 00s, and had his parole revoked after he sought contact with 4-5 year old children and admitted to considering molesting them.<p>* Following his sentence, he was committed involuntarily to a psychiatric facility after a hearing with a jury found unanimously that he was a danger to the community and likely to offend again.<p>* As was his right, he annually challenged his commitment, and in 2010 had an evaluation that determined that while he was more likely than not to offend again, his condition didn&#x27;t then meet the standard required to confine him at the psychiatric facility, and he was released.<p>* At that point in 2010, he was as a matter of law free, &quot;maximally discharged&quot;, with no lawful encumbrances remaining on his whereabouts or activities.<p>* During the time he was committed (but after his criminal sentence had expired), Wisconsin passed a law requiring lifetime GPS monitoring for people convicted of the kinds of crimes he was convicted for.<p>* The state contends that because he was involuntarily committed fairly as a matter of law, and because the hearing that released him from that commitment was aware of the GPS monitoring law when they determined he could be released, the GPS monitoring act was fairly applied to him.<p>* The state also contends that the GPS monitoring requirement isn&#x27;t a &quot;punishment&quot; but rather a public safety mechanism.<p>* The court roundly and vividly rejected the idea that the GPS bracelet wasn&#x27;t punitive, and found that because his commitment followed from a criminal conviction for which his sentence was entirely served, he couldn&#x27;t be punished retroactively.<p>* The court also determined that because SCOTUS had already established that merely attaching a GPS monitor to a car temporarily constituted a 4A search, there was no possible way the state could prevail in any argument that suggested that lifetime GPS monitoring of a person was <i>not</i> a 4A search.<p>As EFF says, this case is really more about retroactive punishment than anything else. This plaintiff if a corner case. 10 years from now, we can expect lifetime GPS monitoring to be the norm in states like Wisconsin.<p>Irrelevant but interesting note from the article:<p>Pedophilia is a diagnosis recognized by the court as warranting involuntary commitment, but the state cannot premise arguments on the idea that pedophiles will <i>compelled</i> to molest children. If they were, pedophiles could evade criminal convictions by pleading insanity.",1450835936

So that the Falcon 9 can lift X Metric tons to orbit for $Y. The way in which they keep the value $Y low is by re-using the first stage. Every satellite project knows the throw weight of all the common launch vehicles and their cost per kilo. And that is how you plan you satellite design.<p>Now at the moment SpaceX gets 9 merlin engines and the first stage booster back for &quot;free&quot; (which is to say that the cost paid assumed it would be consumed in the launch) but as they learn what they can do they will use that cost savings to offer cheaper launch services (more business) until they have a full launch schedule and then keep any excess value for re-investment.<p>But an interesting question is this, given that they have a &quot;used&quot; first stage, who would be willing to launch on it? It has no track record and no reliability statistics other than it worked at least once before. To develop that information you need to re-launch them.

I can also solve it for the subset of all programs that do halt by simply running the program and reporting when it halts that it does, in fact, halt.<p>More usefully, the type systems in Peaker&#x27;s examples rely on user-provided annotations to help the compiler &quot;see&quot; the truth of the user&#x27;s claims (or equivalently, the compilers restrict the class of programs they operate on to those programs which contain sufficient user-provided annotations).

If they&#x27;re not equipped with effective tamper-evident seals and/or escorted by a trustworthy courier at all times then they can (and probably will) be intercepted. It&#x27;s tough to gain access to the small ones, but a shipping container is much harder to keep under watch at all times. It only matters if you get caught with your hands in the cookie jar after all.<p>I&#x27;d guess the typewriters weren&#x27;t shipped in tamper-proof containers and were simply altered en route. I once read a story that I can&#x27;t find again about the CIA intercepting a shipment of (what I think were fighter planes?) and disassembling them overnight, then putting them back together to be on the train again the next morning. It was a great story, I wish I could find it again.",1450832576

If this was possible, it would be a huge blow to publishers. Imagine a new game being released on PS4 for $60. A good number of people buy the game at release, play it through and then put it up on a marketplace at a lower price. At this time, there is zero incentive for a buyer to get it from PlayStation store since he will get the exact same product in either case.<p>I say this as a gamer who exclusively buys digital downloads these days. Would I like to be able to resell downloaded games? Yes. I just don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s realistic.",1450832574

8322047,comment,8320968,8321998,3,0,jroesch,,,"I think one of the core challenges is how traits play with HKTs. You can only allow for the defining of HKed type parameters and type arguments so many ways, but it becomes more complicated when dealing with the resolution of traits around HKTs. In Haskell for ex. there is no `Self` so the type class can easily be dispatched on a higher kinded type without needing a receiver type. In Rust `Self` must currently be fully applied as it is resolved from a value directly: `value.trait_method` and we pick our instance based on value&#x27;s type. If we want to implement Functor (Mappable or w/e) we need to come up with another approach. I&#x27;ve thought about a few but they seem to play best with multi-dispatch + associated types + where clauses. I&#x27;m hoping to finish the RFC once all these features land and I can actually hack a prototype, instead of scribbling on paper.",1410821586

8322040,comment,8320968,8321350,13,0,dbaupp,,,"As others have said, having a package management system that deeply understands the language and tooling is awesome. Examples:<p>- Rust has a distributed-by-default documentation generator (rustdoc), cargo knows this and provides `cargo doc` to render a library&#x27;s docs with it.<p>- rustdoc can run code examples in the documentation as tests, to check that everything is up-to-date, `cargo test` does this (along with running the in-source unit tests and any external tests).<p>- the Rust compiler allows for plugins, which are dynamic libraries loaded into the compiler and can be used for things like custom macros (aka procedural macros aka syntax extensions) and custom compiler warnings. cargo understands these, allows them to be &#x27;imported&#x27; via the normal dependency mechanism, and specifying `plugin = true` in a package makes cargo do the right thing, e.g. building as a dynamic library (static libraries are the default) and compiling for the correct target when cross-compiling.<p>I&#x27;m sure all of this is possible with other systems, but it seems unlikely to be <i>so</i> nice to use.",1410821459

The issue could have taken weeks to surface and days to track down, and the C++ compiler simply didn&#x27;t have enough information to determine that it was a problem.

If you are writing security critical applications Rust will provide you with some very important guarantees (ie. there are certain mistakes which are inherently not possible in the language). C++ doesn&#x27;t really guarantee anything and if you&#x27;re an idiot you can shoot yourself in the face. However in practical terms memory management in C++11 is very straightforwards and C++11 compliant code (ie. using the STL and not writing it like C) is very safe and clean. You&#x27;re not mucking with raw pointers anymore<p>The main issue I see is that Rust is still in early development. It may or may not get &quot;big&quot; in the coming years. And library support is ... lacking<p>In contrast C++ has the STL and boost and every library under the sun. I haven&#x27;t working with a lot of other languages extensively, but I&#x27;ve never seen anything as clean, robust and thorough as the STL and boost. C++ will remain relevant for a long long time.

But let’s be honest, manually working with pthreads in C++ is quite the headache, but parallism in Haskell is super easy.<p>C++ has std::thread and it would be very simple to parallelize this program, so yes it is unfair. I also wonder just how optimized the C++ AVL library is when it contains &quot;//Assignment 6&quot; at the top of its header. The C++ program is also non-optimal in that it is doing 2x lookups for each insert, once for the insert and then another to increment the counter. I haven&#x27;t investigated the Haskell to see if it does the same.<p>Another important point is that mutable single node data structures like AVL or red black trees provide a property that the Haskell data structure cannot: stable iterators. If you don&#x27;t need this property then you can usually get better run-times by using a more cache efficient data-structure like a BTree.<p>This is a very biased comparison.",1410819053

I just don&#x27;t get why the compiler should decide on such a large thing, instead of letting the programmer do it. One can always be more explicit if one feels they&#x27;re getting value from it. If someone wants to write a bunch of terse code, why stop them? Does the compiler gain a large benefit from not having to include this feature? Who loses by allowing users to do what they want?<p>Comparing C# and F#, the extra annotations change the frequency in which I&#x27;ll introduce an inner (local) function. For instance, here&#x27;s a little helper in a piece of code I&#x27;m writing at the moment. It&#x27;s part of a larger function and isn&#x27;t exposed beyond 5 lines of code.<p><pre><code>  let runWithLog f name =\n    try run f name with ex -> logExn ex\n</code></pre>\nUsed in:\n  runWithLog &quot;sessions&quot; collectSessionStats \n  runWithLog &quot;visitors&quot; collectVisitorStats<p>Having to add &quot;(f: string -> RunParams -> Whatever -> unit) (name: string)&quot; almost doubles runWithLog helper yet provides no benefit. And this an extremely simple case! Once the arguments are generic, higher-order functions themselves, it gets quite noisy.<p>Sure, if it&#x27;s a top-level export, then maybe annotating is a good idea. But if it&#x27;s limited in scope then what&#x27;s the harm?<p>Not that it&#x27;ll change when I use Rust - there&#x27;s nothing competing in this category. It&#x27;d just be nice if the language let the user decide on the style.",1410818650

As for cheap, try sharing a panel: <a href=""https://oshpark.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://oshpark.com</a><p>Parent&#x27;s talking about prototyping, so injection molding ain&#x27;t going to work. A good path is to test with 3D prints, iterating with cheap consumer-quality stuff until you need to test mechanical/fit more accurately, then get a shop to print your forms with a professional printer.<p>I&#x27;ve never heard of anyone going from Sketchup to injection moldable files, but I suppose that&#x27;s... possible? Rhino for Mac is in free beta right now - not ideal, but easy enough to learn as far as these programs go. 3D modeling really is not that easy to get a handle on, and then doing it for manufacturable parts is another thing. Uploading your files for Protomold to auto-analyze is a good way to learn about what&#x27;s manufacturable, at a really basic level (because Protomold can only make basic parts).<p>But physical prototyping depends on what you&#x27;re making, of course. The above makes sense if you&#x27;re just making a case for electronics, and it doesn&#x27;t have to have any particularly interesting performance characteristics itself. If you&#x27;re prototyping something flexible, for example, that&#x27;s really hard to prototype with a 3D printer since the likelihood of finding a printed material close to your final is small. In that case, you may have better luck with casting silicone, etc.<p>For Coolest, I guess you&#x27;d want to prototype the novel user-manipulable features, but a cooler is a cooler and presumably his partners know how to make those. If he hasn&#x27;t prototyped the novel features, I predict there&#x27;ll be a delay if he&#x27;s got a reasonable standard of quality, and at least, the final will look different from what people have seen so far.",1410818505

And beyond that, many simply don&#x27;t know this system exists at all. I was excited reading your blog post, but by the end of it, I still had no clue what EI2 really <i>is</i>. If EI2 were a startup whose target client is undergraduate students, it would not be making the money that it should. There&#x27;s something fundamentally wrong with that. You&#x27;ve built a cool product, but for whom?<p>I don&#x27;t think we need to &quot;drownproof&quot; students. That&#x27;s getting too many steps ahead of ourselves. We instead need to instill the entrepreneurial spirit into the average student before he or she will ever care about drowning.<p>From my (limited) perspective as a student, the problem is ignorance.

The point of the article was - as I understand it - that we should be suspicious of people who just won&#x27;t put their money where their mouth is:<p>&quot;The skin in the game heuristic is best viewed as a rule of thumb that places a pragmatic \nconstraint on normative theories. Whatever the best moral theory  (consequentialism, \ndeontology, contractualism, virtue ethics, particularism etc.) or political ideology (socialism, \ncapitalism, libertarianism) might be, the &#x27;rule&#x27; tells us that we should be suspicious of people \nwho appeal to it to justify actions that pass the cost of any risk-taking to another party whilst \nkeeping the benefits for themselves.&quot;<p>Designers who wouldn&#x27;t drive a car they designed.

I think most of us would, as a matter of course, get people to put their money where their mouth is if we could practically pin people down to it on a day to day basis. But, in reality, I might not choose to be treated in the hospital I work at because I can afford better care, or because I think some of the people there have it in for me, even if I&#x27;m an excellent doctor. I might not choose to drive a car I designed because I can afford a better one, or have different tastes.<p>etc etc.<p>And that&#x27;s even in the case that I can show that I&#x27;ve skin in the game.

My food for thought is:<p>Small transactional costs stop things from existing at the fetal/growth stage. Evolution destroys them long before the long-term benefits demonstrate themselves as it supports short-term adaptive traits over long-term adaptive traits. If you require skin-in-the-game transactional costs then your transactions will happen far less often, and in the short-term you will get out-competed for resources by those that protect themselves with top-down regulations.<p>It is often difficult for third-parties to evaluate the authenticity of a cost or regulation, which is why institutional costs exist - they factor out hundreds of checks of hundreds of transactions into a single check of the institution that regulates hundreds of transactions (which itself is often proxied by the social proofing of this institution.) This lowers the transaction cost which causes high growth.<p>Fetal is really a good analogy here. The womb exists for good reason; scaffolds exist for good reason; decorum on first dates exists for good reason. Without these things early transactional costs defeat growth.<p>In short, skin-in-the-game evolves out of artificial systems as it is bad for early-growth. However this does not mean that it should; in well-designed/natural systems the entity first exists in a protective bubble during its gestation period and then slowly has its skin placed in the game.",1375144292

In my view, the OP is showing intelligent intuition about software.<p>I&#x27;ve encountered the exact same issues that they have. It&#x27;s frustrating when code wrapped up in a function prevents you from testing or experimenting in a REPL. It&#x27;s infuriating when a framework wraps your code in one of these mega-lambdas so you can&#x27;t get at it. There are many programming techniques that require the ability to breach encapsulation when appropriate.<p>Meanwhile, the virtues of enforced privacy are overrated. There are countless ways to screw up software; trying to lock things down so the next guy can&#x27;t screw them up (preventing access, etc.) is a classic mistake. Modularity is extremely important in systems design, but not as an enforcement mechanism. It&#x27;s an organizational tool. It&#x27;s about decomposition and factoring, not hiding things so that only you can control them.<p>It&#x27;s worth noting that Smalltalk doesn&#x27;t have private methods [1], and that this was regarded as a feature not a bug. That alone shows that there&#x27;s no particular link between enforced-privacy and OO, or even enforced-privacy and encapsulation.<p>To some extent this is a matter of taste, but I come down on the side that sees little value (and considerable drawbacks) in the privacy fetish.

Undergrads have the technical skills required, there is absolutely no denying that. And if they don&#x27;t, they&#x27;ll go off and learn them. It&#x27;s 2013, MOOCs are everywhere.

6124663,comment,6124595,6124595,1,0,dcaisen,,,"WASHINGTONSome big Wall Street firms are throwing their weight behind an upstart trading platform pitching itself as an antidote to a mounting problem in the stock market: predatory high-frequency trading.<p>The platform, IEX Group Inc., will go head-to-head in October with established stock exchanges and &quot;dark pools,&quot; private trading venues that don&#x27;t publish buy and sell prices for stocks. Its aim is to nullify certain advantages enjoyed by high-speed traders, such as the ability to detect large orders by less fleet-footed traders and make trades ahead of them.<p>Its backers say IEX will provide a haven for firms that are looking to swap larger chunks of stocks, such as mutual funds and hedge funds. It plans to impose a uniform split-second delay on all trades executed on the exchange, offer a limited number of order types, and forgo the widespread practice among exchanges of paying firms that post orders on their venues.<p>IEX has garnered interest from firms such as Goldman Sachs Group Inc. GS -1.26% and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., and has attracted financial backing from fund managers including Los Angeles-based Capital Group Cos., which manages American Funds and has $1.2 trillion in assets, and Brandes Investment Partners, a San Diego firm with $25 billion under management.<p>A Goldman representative said the firm sees IEX as &quot;a true departure from the existing exchange models.&quot; More than 50 of Goldman&#x27;s institutional clients have expressed interest in IEX, the bank said.<p>Still, IEX, with about 30 employees, could have a hard time steering enough trading to its platform to reduce the need for the high-frequency element, as it hopes. High-speed trading represents about half of all stock trading, and is seen by many experts as a necessary cog in today&#x27;s computer-driven market, providing the steady flow of buy and sell orders that helps traditional, long-term investors trade.<p>IEX Chief Executive Brad Katsuyama, who spent about a decade designing sophisticated trading systems in New York for Royal Bank of Canada, says large money managers have become disillusioned with stock exchanges catering to high-speed clients. IEX&#x27;s ambition, he says, is to &quot;provide a common place&quot; for such investors to trade in relative safety by curbing the ability of quick-draw firms to detect large orders and trade ahead of them.<p>That hasn&#x27;t happened with other nonexchange trading venues, typically owned by a single broker-dealer. But no brokers will have a stake in IEX, which instead is largely owned by institutional investment firms and private investors. Mr. Katsuyama, 35 years old, hopes the distinction will encourage brokers to trade on IEX, since they won&#x27;t be trading on a competitor&#x27;s platform.<p>Regulators are turning up the heat on high-speed trading. The Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating whether stock exchanges have provided high-speed traders advantages over regular investors. The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority recently sent letters to high-frequency firms seeking more information about the computer codes they use to trade, with an eye on whether the firms have proper risk checks in place.<p>Unlike dark pools, IEX plans to publish traders&#x27; buy and sell orders. It will have four order typescommands that prioritize how an investor&#x27;s orders are handled by an exchangeas opposed to the dozens of order types provided by exchanges that have drawn scrutiny from regulators.<p>IEX also will forgo the so-called rebates that many exchanges pay firms that help provide buy and sell orders. The payments, typically about 25 to 30 cents per 100 shares, primarily benefit high-frequency trading firms that provide orders.<p>At the same time, exchanges charge firms a fee for taking those orders. For firms that trade millions of shares a day, those rebates and fees add up to either a significant windfall or cost.<p>Many high-speed firms have designed strategies that allow them to pocket rebates, while brokers trading on behalf of fund clients typically pay the fees. IEX will charge a flat fee of nine cents for every 100 shares a firm buys or sells. Its hope is that firms trading solely to get a rebate will send their orders elsewhere, Mr. Katsuyama says, while brokers will pay a lower fee to trade than they do on exchanges.<p>IEX also plans to house clients&#x27; computers in a separate building from its own computer system, introducing a delay of 350 millionths of a second between the time a client sends an order from its server and when it reaches IEX&#x27;s computers. Trade information exiting from IEX&#x27;s system will have the same delay.<p>That is a departure from the practice at other stock exchanges, which place client computers in the same building as their own and have cut delays to less than 10 millionths of a second at times. The shorter delay gives high-speed firms the ability to react to trades at the exchange faster than other firms whose computers aren&#x27;t housed in the same building, among other advantages.<p>While such protections have sparked interest among big investment firms, it remains to be seen whether enough will send orders to IEX. &quot;We&#x27;re hopeful that the platform will draw liquidity to it,&quot; said Matt Lyons, who runs global stock trading at Capital Group, an IEX investor. &quot;The proof will be in the pudding.&quot;",1375142816

6124653,comment,6123042,6124000,1,0,wonderzombie,,,"Respectfully, I think your critique is entirely misguided. What you wrote above sounds more like a explanation in search of a phenomenon rather than the reverse. Couching a social phenomenon in a socioeconomic context seems like an especially poor fit, IMHO.<p>For instance, do you really think the police, SNAP, and federal assistance for hurricane victims incline people to flame others on the Internet? Folks who need food stamps are probably among the least likely to spend &quot;all their time on the Internet,&quot; and more likely to be working two jobs. I&#x27;m not sure the presence of cops, SNAP, or FEMA matter to folks who don&#x27;t need any of those things in a concrete fashion.<p>More importantly, though, it&#x27;s a fallacy to assume that this sentiment is new merely because it&#x27;s newly-ish observed. I do think there&#x27;s an economic component, given how shitty the economy is compared to previous generations&#x27; experience; people are unhappy, but I suspect some of that stems from the idea that they&#x27;re on their own, whereas &quot;everyone else&quot; (or perhaps the rich) is getting a handout. Actually, I&#x27;m not even sure folks like millennials believe that in aggregate, but I don&#x27;t know for sure.<p>That said, anonymity combined with increased connectivity <i>is</i> novel, and I think it&#x27;s an enabling factor. I think our social mores and our tools haven&#x27;t caught up. People can say whatever comes to mind with little or no consequences, and the onus is on the recipient to filter that. There&#x27;s a many-to-one relationship there and it&#x27;s hard to manage.<p>A technological, &quot;dumb&quot; answer would be applying sentiment analysis to emails, tweets, et al. Incorporate as signals stuff like: whether it&#x27;s a first-time sender; whether the Twitter account has followers; and so on. It&#x27;s possible these would be band-aids for a real social problem. Or perhaps they would at least lower the percentage in harassing people online.<p>Socially, it might help if escalated harassment (i.e. persistent, involving death threats, etc) were treated as legal matters. As it is now I suspect it&#x27;s too hard for victims to do much, and that it can be difficult to get the police to pay attention to it. I don&#x27;t really have a concrete proposal; I just have a intuition that reporting harassment or stalking to the police is unlikely to be productive as it stands now, and I think the law is unfortunately a really blunt instrument, so this would be hard to get right. (It wouldn&#x27;t have to be <i>perfect</i>, since no solution which will scale to hundreds of millions of people could possibly be.)<p>Internet mob justice is probably the answer that will happen from time to time, when people decide to deliberately out trolls. I am not a big fan of Internet mob justice, but sometimes it seems like it&#x27;s that or no justice at all.",1375142669

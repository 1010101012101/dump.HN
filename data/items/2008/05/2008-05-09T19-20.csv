I believe it would be uncommon for the customer to spec out everything down to what each screen looks like and the logic behind each page and it would be uncommon for the saleperson to do that too.  Someone has to be the ""interpreter"" between the customer vision and the salespersons vision (both of which are valuable) and come up with a working prototype or at least page by page html screens.<p>I guess that begs the question who in your company is the interpreter.  Sounds like you would be a good fit for that position.  An approach would be ""Hi my name is x in x position, great job on the sale with x company.  I would like to help define the x features that will be released upon launch and a timeline for the customer to launch as quickly as possible and help define launch dates for the remaining features"".",1210363176

Many games make the bulk of their money in a few weeks or months. To be effective, DRM only needs to keep the hackers busy for this period -- or so says the advertising of the DRM creators.<p>After this period, however, the DRM serves no purpose other than to frustrate legitimate buyers.  Ideally, the game creators would disable the DRM after it has served its purpose, thereby eliminating problems for their customers as well as freeing up server resources and support call costs.  Unfortunately, there are few companies willing to do this.",1210363082

185815,comment,185348,185682,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"The ""simple"" explanation is that lots of people think that quantum mechanics is nondeterministic. And it isn't. If you know the quantum state of a system at time X you can figure out what it will be at any time after that.<p>People get confused because it's easy to look at a quantum mechanics problem from the wrong angle and see nondeterminism. We're really well trained in intuitive mechanics (""an electron is like a tiny tennis ball, and tennis balls are always either <i>here</i> or <i>there</i>, right?"") so at first glance quantum mechanics seems wacky and random: the electron might be here, or it might be there, with <i>equal probability</i>, and we can't tell which! Whereupon your head explodes. Seriously: The discoverers of quantum exploded in horror, and they started ranting about that crazy cat in the box, or ""God playing dice"". (Colorful but misleading metaphors. One reason that Bohr and Einstein's early confusion persists today is that they were just so darned <i>eloquent</i>.)<p>In fact, God does not play dice: God sees <i>all the outcomes of the dice roll at the same time</i> and doesn't understand why we think it's a game, and not a static work of art.<p>People also think that nondeterminism is somehow an important ingredient in whatever it is we mean by ""free will"". This doesn't make much sense to me. If you want it to not make sense to you as well, read Daniel Dennett's <i>Freedom Evolves</i>. You might want to budget more than a couple hours for that book, though.",1210362448

I'd argued enough with myself about whether it was a good idea; I didn't think that either me nor my boss was going to convince the other, so I didn't see anything productive that could come out of the discussion.<p>Interestingly, our sales guy (who'd been sent to me earlier to get me to stay) saw this immediately.  After I explained why I was doing this, he said immediately, ""So, even if the Goldman Sachs deal came through tomorrow, and we were rolling in customers, you'd still leave?""  I said ""Yeah.  This is something I have to do, regardless of what the outcome is or what I'm giving up in the process.""   And he just said, ""Interesting.  I see where you're coming from.  You should go do it; when you're this set on something, you're doing a disservice both to us and to yourself to not pursue it.""",1210359953

In any job, no matter how enjoyable or rewarding overall, there are elements which are more interesting and others that are less so.<p>In my job, the ratio of fun stuff to non-fun stuff is quite high, but still finite -- there's still a fair amount of boring stuff I need to work on periodically. I find that one technique which works well is to try to pipeline my work (if possible) such that I can work on multiple aspects of it simultaneously. Then I can devote a few hours per day (or days per week) on the boring stuff, with the thought of working on the exciting stuff immediately afterwards as a strong motivator.<p>BTW if anyone finds a job that's uniformly exciting/fun throughout with no boring parts, let me know =)",1210359864

Although this article is merely a pro-journalism example of the very same ""consider the case of sites X and Y, where X and Y are cannot be named"" phenomenon, so it still isn't clear to me how large the risk is.<p>And I'm with justindz, who doesn't understand the proposed defense. If a competitor decides to cross the ethical line and take your site down by ""generously"" having spambots put up links to your site, thereby causing Google to conclude that you're a spammer and shut down your pagerank... can't they do this to all of your sites at once, not just one? My understanding -- correct me if I'm wrong -- is that the cost or supply of spambots is not the limiting factor here.",1210359691

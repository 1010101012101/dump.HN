137405,comment,137351,137351,0,0,jasonlbaptiste,,,"founders- salary for sure.  I don't think you can really measure a founder's contribution by the hours they put in. As Founders, its understood we're putting in insane hours.  If we were ""charging"" by the hour, most startups would be broke.<p>One off work- For development maintenance, some design work,etc. definitely go with hourly.  Have your shit together when it comes to specs, design, what the project entails.  If things go overboard, you might be kicking yourself.  It's also a good way to see if that person might be worth joining the team, without making a huge up front commitment.",1205560524

Please understand that I disagree with yours, too. The ""tangential direction"" you are complaining about is the reason I posted the article. I would not have posted it otherwise. You should be glad that people who disagree can still be helpful each other, rather than complaining that your free ice cream wasn't the appropriate flavor.",1205559991
137402,comment,137351,137351,0,0,dkokelley,,,"I think it depends on where the startup is in its development. If there is no income, and the startup is very young, there should be no employees. The founders should all take a salary, even if it's just a token salary of their living expenses, for tax purposes.<p>In my opinion, anyone working on building the primary product of a company (the hackers) should be a founder, or have a significant equity share in the company, especially if the company has yet to earn a profit (assumed if the primary product isn't build yet).<p>If the startup is at the point where they are earning a steady income, and needs to hire additional people, then it depends on the role needed. Secretaries, customer support, and other administrative work should be hourly (or even better, contracted out). Sales should be commission (to the extent permitted by law). Additional hackers should be on salary with stock options and the expectation to do a lot of work beyond the typical 40 hour work week.<p>I'm interested in hearing what others think about my suggestions. Please let me know what's worked/worked better for you.",1205559884

137399,comment,137359,137389,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I think the emotional rollercoaster applies to anything you do where you have a large personal stake in it and yet it's new, innovative, and unproven.  I remember feeling that way with several of my volunteer & employment projects, even though the outcome wouldn't make a financial difference to me either way.<p>It's exacerbated when you actually start working on your startup, though, because you have so much more invested.  If it's just your idea, then it's only your pride at stake.  When you start backing it up with your own money and large amounts of your time, it can become overwhelming unless you specifically try not to think about it.<p>It's gotten to the point where when my friends ask me how the startup's going, I answer ""Depends when you ask.  Right now, pretty well, but if you asked me this morning, I'd tell you that we're doomed.""",1205559202
137398,comment,137351,137351,0,0,fizz,,,"A startup will need to hire strong talent and retain them during critical periods to have a hope of success. The enticement needs to go beyond a simple deal of annual or hourly agreement. Bonuses based on completion of goals and other kinds of benefits are important. Shares in the company is even more important. If you don't have the enticement, you can just quit tomorrow and paid just as much somewhere else. The cost to the employee who quits is a tiny amount of risk in transitioning to a new job. The cost to the startup can be huge due to delays in hiring and ramping up new employees.",1205558802

137396,comment,137351,137384,0,0,jk4930,,,"Think of employees as subcontractors. Their basic monthly salaries are your costs of having them on standby to work on your assignments. Then you can (more or less) calculate the value of a unit to your company / project and that's what you pay for it. Roughly speaking. So ""unit"" won't translate into ""work unit"" (like LoC and similar quantities) but into ""subproject"". And so we're talking about capital budgeting. A good hacker can understand and apply this creatively after some good books or courses (or the VC advisors provide the knowledge), 'cause in the end it's just some basic concepts + formulae.",1205558481

137392,comment,137244,137330,0,0,whacked_new,,,"I have a related story. During a visit to a doctor when I was a kid, the doctor found me unruly, noisy, and over-active. Being a friend of my parents, he flatly and frankly told them, and in front of me, that I ""cannot sit still"" and suggested they enroll me into a Go classroom, which they promptly did.<p>After a few months I visited him again, and he said, again in everyone's presence, that I was ""much better."" I was actually not yet mature enough to care or comprehend what it was all about, but I am thankful for having had those lessons.<p>I also daresay that the benefits of taking such lessons would have comparable or perhaps superior effects to these lab-controlled exercises, at least when there is still uncertainty.<p>However, as per the article, the goal, I believe, is self regulation, so at least in my case, the neural changes probably were not focused in the cerebellum.",1205558211

137390,comment,137358,137358,0,0,deltapoint,,,"Good idea, but it is still rough. The actual value of the idea wouldn't matter in an auction setting, it would just be the perceived value that would matter. And that perception would usually be flawed.<p>IP has value. I don't know if a mere idea with no protection is IP though.<p>Information is meant to disseminate. It is nearly impossible to manage the spread of the information. Nothing stops someone from reselling an idea or just distributing it freely after distribution.<p>Usually when ideas are sold there is a specific context for the ideas. Consultants can come in and just give advice (ideas) and receive compensation, but they are solving a problem. Not just a random idea.",1205557448

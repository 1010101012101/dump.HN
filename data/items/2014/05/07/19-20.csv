I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s been tried before, but there&#x27;s a way to organize a service like this, one that relies completely on user-generated content, that would likely be much more resilient: a cooperative.<p>Forgive me if this is half-baked. I&#x27;m not an expert by any means.<p>Add a pledge level of, say, $150, with the reward being that you become a founding consumer-member of the upcoming.org co-op. The way co-ops work, the surplus or benefit of the co-op&#x27;s operations is periodically distributed (as a &quot;patronage dividend&quot;) to the members in proportion to their &quot;patronage&quot; of the co-op in that period. In a worker co-op, patronage is usually defined as hours worked and the surplus is basically the profits of the business (cash). In a consumer co-op like a natural food store, a member&#x27;s patronage is how much they spend in the store, and the patronage dividend comes in the form of lower prices.<p>You could define patronage in the upcoming.org co-op as participation in the site: contributing content, performing moderation, that sort of thing. The patronage dividend can be distributed in the form of free or discounted admissions to events or other rewards of that sort. Otherwise, it would operate the same as it would as a for-profit corporation (probably ad-supported in some way).<p>(In case it&#x27;s not clear, I&#x27;m not saying the site should be members-only. Anyone would still be able to have full use the site, but those who pay the $150 membership contribution would just have additional privileges and/or responsibilities.)<p>As far as operations, it could be a multi-stakeholder co-op, as in a hybrid worker/consumer co-op. There would be two classes of members, one for employees and one for users. Some proportion of seats on the board of directors would be elected by each class (maybe 50/50). The board would then hire managers charged with keeping everything running (monitoring budgets and all that). In that way, the user-members would have a voice in major decisions, via their board vote.<p>There would be no risk of the founder selling out, because it&#x27;s a standard part of the by-laws of most co-ops that memberships/votes are non-transferable and the co-op as a whole can&#x27;t be sold unless it&#x27;s to an entity that maintains the rights of the members (i.e. another co-op).<p>The main downsides are more organizational complexity and overhead and the fact that the founder has a much smaller upside potential. In other words, the best-case scenario for the founder is pretty much a stable job.<p>Obviously a lot of details would have to be worked out, but I can&#x27;t help thinking that all the talk about building something sustainable for &quot;the community&quot; is pretty rhetorical if you&#x27;re not willing to actually give the community a stake in it.",1399492273

Just as an example: It&#x27;s pretty simple to implement a mutable reference cell as an actor which contains only pure functional code.

One day things can be great, the next you&#x27;re looking into the abyss. Although this can seem dreary, this is more reason to enjoy the health and quality of life you have today.<p>* There is never a wrong time to go after the things you feel are important. When I found my Mom was diagnosed, I disengaged from work for a good couple weeks thanks to a great manager (and, thankfully, a pretty convenient lull in strong deadlines). After much soul searching, I knew that life was too short to work at the large company I was working at, and it was time to pursue my dreams of being self-employed, something I knew I wanted to do full time since I was ten years old.  Seriously, I knew I wanted to be self-employed even back then.  That was over 2.5 years ago, and I am still happily self-employed. My Mom&#x27;s illness gave me the perspective I needed to stop worrying too much about certain types of failure, especially since I had been saving up a reasonable emergency fund in case my self-employment experiment failed.  Thankfully, it has not!<p>* Steve Jobs&#x27;s fantastic Stanford commencement speech lucidly talks about this realization: &quot;Remembering that I&#x27;ll be dead soon is the most important tool I&#x27;ve ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Because almost everything — all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure - these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important. Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.&quot; To be clear: that does not mean YOLO, nor does it encourage making unwise decisions. But the death of my Mom was the ultimate in sobering reminders of the importance of this thought, and since that reminder it has shaped many parts of my life.<p>As someone else commented, whatever emotions you feel are okay, as long as they are not hurting you.  Surrounding yourself with any friends and loved ones is the path to healing, even if they don&#x27;t understand what you&#x27;re going through.

We currently have 137,677 lines of ASCII Ledger-CLI data.  We&#x27;re thus likely the largest Ledger data set in real-world operations on the planet.<p>We switched to Ledger-CLI simply because it was the only Free Software accounting tool that had the flexibility to handle the complex area of non-profit accounting called &quot;fiscal sponsorship&quot;, which is the primary purpose of our organization.<p>However, the fact is, I keep the books myself because Ledger-CLI gives you an excellent set of books that only a hacker could love.  That said, our accountants after a few annual audits that were painful, this year absolutely love our reporting and find our audit a breeze (see the contrib/ area of Ledger-CLI&#x27;s repository for the scripts we use for reporting).<p>Our biggest challenge now is that we are growing and need a programmer who can use Emacs, the command line, and revision control systems to keep our books isn&#x27;t scalable.

7712192,comment,7711200,7711815,10,0,dba7dba,,,"> I&#x27;m shocked, shocked that there is shitty software running in this Samsung establishment.<p>haha. As someone with some knowledge of Korea, I can add a few pointers. Of course it should NOT be used to paint a broad black/white picture of S Korea or even the state of IT companies in S Korea, but let me try. Please note this is just a personal view.<p>First, Samsung and other S Korean companies know their weakness is software. They started providing more funding for software majors and Samsung even started a program where they will sponsor (pay salary, provide office space) high school graduates (but not in college yet) to study coding and put out projects over a period of a years (?) all in order to have more more talent get into software.<p>So WHY this seemingly lack of talent/interest in software building in S Korea&#x27;s mega corporations? Surely with companies such as Hyundai Motors and Hyundai Shipyards and Samsung memory chips, it shouldn&#x27;t be that hard to find good software engineers and coders?<p>I was told one reason is software piracy. It&#x27;s gotten much better but in the past software piracy was a big issue in SK. I&#x27;ve used/seen many softwares in the past but the only one that ever required a physical dongle for licensing was a Korean Word processor. I had to support it a bit many many years ago. That was the only one with physical dongle for licensing that I&#x27;ve come across. Why the piracy? Well because people didn&#x27;t have money (or thought didn&#x27;t have enough money to spend on some intangible thing that requires a fee based upgrade in just a 1 or so). There&#x27;s a reason linux/opensource is strong in some countries. Some just don&#x27;t have the money to spend on software.<p>So due to piracy, a generation of students came to think that software was not a secure career path. Why get into a career to work to build something that can be easily copied at little cost?<p>Another reason I see is English. Again, it&#x27;s gotten better with the obscene amount of money the nation as a whole spends on learning English and now other languages. But learning English for S Koreans used to be pretty intimidating. Sure source code is nonsensical alphabets to even native English speakers. Imagine someone learning English for first time starting in middle school with a dozen other subjets to learn. No wonder it was hard to find decent English speaker/writer in S Korea for decades. If you were decent at English, you had other far more prestigous/lucrative career path for you.<p>One possible reason that the seemingly big/stable corporations in S Korea don&#x27;t seem to attract good coders is requirement for degree from top school. Getting into good college in S Korea is hard enough. Well, getting into one of the big corporations like Hyundai/Samsung is even more competitive. And we all know the really outstanding programmer/coder/startupers usually didn&#x27;t have a degree when they started out in programming/IT. Like Jobs, Gates, etc.<p>That&#x27;s my 2 cents.",1399491084

With that setup, you can offer discounts for the IAP to previous customers (basically, by having 2 IAPs that unlock the same functionality, but you only present one to the user). So your repeat customers still need to pay full price for the Regular edition but their Pro upgrade is cheap (or free).<p>Of course, most apps don&#x27;t really split into Regular and Pro very well, so this solution won&#x27;t work for a lot of people.",1399490601

7712139,comment,7707262,7709159,2,0,smichael,,,"This is perceived as a big problem by many people. Here are some current options:<p>CSV:<p>You download CSV data from your bank (manually, probably). Then you convert it to ledger journal format using one of a number of tools: CSV2Ledger, reckon, Ledger, hledger (both have CSV support built in by now), or something you write yourself. This data is &quot;single-entry&quot; and doesn&#x27;t know about your chart of accounts, so you augment and translate it into more useful general journal entries. There are several approaches being explored:<p>- rule-based - you set up rules, matching patterns in the description, which assign accounts and balancing postings. Eg: CSV2Ledger, hledger (currently; eg <a href=""http://hledger.org/manual#csv-files"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hledger.org/manual#csv-files</a>).<p>- history-based - the CSV description is matched against transactions already in the journal, and the most similar one is used as a template to flesh out the new transaction. Eg: Ledger (<a href=""http://ledger-cli.org/3.0/doc/ledger3.html#The-_003csamp_003e_003cspan-class_003d_0022command_0022_003econvert_003c_002fspan_003e_003c_002fsamp_003e-command"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ledger-cli.org/3.0/doc/ledger3.html#The-_003csamp_003...</a>).<p>- artificial intelligence - I seem to remember reckon does something else more clever ?<p>OFX:<p>- manual download - as above, but you download an OFX file. OFX records provide more structure than CSV but still need to be fleshed out. ledger-autosync does this, using history matching. It also skips transactions you&#x27;ve already saved to the journal, avoiding duplicates.<p>- automatic download - ledger-autosync can also handle the download, if your bank provides OFX Direct Connect. This is the most automated option at the moment, recommended. I pull transactions daily from Wells Fargo this way (though I&#x27;m going to quit one of these days since they charge too much for it).<p>GNUCash:<p>- In the distant past, ledger could read GNUCash files directly, so you could enter with GNUCash and report with ledger. This feature is long gone, but you might be able to get it working with an old Ledger version, and `print` into a journal file you can then use with modern *ledger.<p>Converting from other finance apps, eg mobile ones:<p>- As above, you might find adhoc ways to import from apps with nicer data entry. Eg use the iXpensit Pro app on iphone, export the CSV, convert that, add crazy automation duct tape until it&#x27;s &quot;smooth&quot;.<p>hledger web:<p>- hledger-web has an add form. It&#x27;s not very good, but it&#x27;s in your browser, and if you&#x27;re really keen you could set it up to be accessible from your smartphone.<p>hledger add:<p>- hledger&#x27;s built-in add command does assisted (history-based, tab completion etc.) interactive data entry on the console. Some folks may find that preferable to editing a text file.<p>Editor modes:<p>- for people used to text editors: ledger-mode provides some data entry conveniences for Emacs users, and there&#x27;s vim-ledger, a ledger bundle for TextMate, etc.<p>HOWEVER...<p>If like me you&#x27;re working on building discipline and insight into your finances, you may find nothing beats manual data entry for a while.

You put it in an oven, then in a freezer, then spray it with water, tumble it in a dusty drum, drop it onto concrete, put a heavy weight on it, blast it with some radio frequency interference for good measure, mash its buttons a million times, then do some accelerated aging (some combination of the above for a few weeks) - and if it keeps working through it all, you have a good, reliable product.

That&#x27;s basically the difference I talk about.<p>Also, there is another difference between newlines and indentation: newlines only go &quot;forward&quot; (next line), whereas with indentation you go back and forth into levels of indentation. It&#x27;s not the same. The closest thing I can think of is that one language where you could write the exponent of a formula on a line before, faking superscript, or the index of a formula on the next, faking subscript. Making mono-typed source code look like math formulas basically (and probably a pain to type out). That&#x27;s the only programming context I can think of where newlines are actually significant in a similar fashion to indentation.",1399489698

6360391,comment,6359786,6360156,1,0,mbell,,,"> RabbitMQ wouldn&#x27;t satisfy the latency requirements?<p>From the comments at the bottom of the article:<p>> I think it would depend on one&#x27;s use case and requirements, but Redis is generally faster than RabbitMQ since it avoids the heavier AMQP protocol overhead and internal (data structure, etc.) implementation (C vs Erlang) and we are using unix sockets to communicate with it (locally) but then it&#x27;s not as reliable as RabbitMQ.<p>In our case it is more important to process a HTTP request as fast as possible, while the processing, propagation and storage of request data for analytics could be slow but has to be reliable therefore we chose the Lua->Redis->agentredrabbit->RabbitMQ model.<p>-------<p>Personally I wouldn&#x27;t think it would be an issue, elsewhere he mentions: &quot;we aim for less than 40ms&quot; I can&#x27;t imagine enqueuing a (seemingly) small message in rabbitMQ takes more than 1 or 2 ms.",1378825137

The OP&#x27;s comments are reasonable as a parent, but like many she doesn&#x27;t properly comprehend the difficulties encountered by a modern day teacher.<p>When I was teaching class, I had to contend with numerous learning obstacles and then had to leave after class for my other full-time programming job. The idea that I could preempt kids from saying a comment is something only a parent could believe. In the minds of high school students, policies were made to be tested.<p>The OP further wants to make young women into white elephants by reminding them how rare they are on the first day of class. I had a far more interesting and engaging introduction to algorithms on the first day of my class using paper airplane folding instructions as an example of how literally computers interpreted your instructions.

6360302,comment,6358441,6358441,1,0,Arjuna,,,"Hello there...<p>Struggling is no piece of cake, especially when it comes to work. Work is obviously a large part of our lives, and we all want to contribute to our maximum potential, working on projects that have meaning and impact, while hopefully doing it along-side cool people who share a common vision.<p>I have written some about this in responses to other &quot;Ask HN&quot; questions [1][2]; these might not be necessarily specific to your situation, but you might find some help in them nonetheless, with regard to the thought process involved with solving your problem.<p>The essential theme in these responses is that you have to work to separate your thoughts out about various items, like the commute, the job itself, the team, etc. That is to say, once you break out the various components of the problem, you can better assess your feelings, your situation, etc. and come to an answer that works best for you.<p>For example, in your post, you identified 2 issues:<p><i>1. You are having a bit of a hard time with the team.</i><p>You don&#x27;t have to do this publicly, but ask yourself some questions to help you identify what is going on in this area. For example, what is the nature of the problem? Do you have a problem with a single person? Do you have a problem with multiple people? Is this problem simply irreconcilable, or is there anything that you can do to resolve this problem?<p><i>2. You feel that things seem to be going nowhere.</i><p>Now, this can, of course, be related to the above, but it&#x27;s still important to break issues like this down into their component parts. For example, why is the project going nowhere? Is it largely related to the above (i.e., having a hard time with the team) or, is it related to something else? Is this a funding issue? Do you no longer believe in the product? Do the people that you work with no longer seem to believe in the product? What if everything was perfect with the team... would you still feel that things are going nowhere?<p>Finally, there could be other issues at play that are making you feel the way that you are, which you may not have considered, and which are not mentioned in your post. For example, if you have a long commute, that can play havoc on how you view your job. Or, you might be burned out, which can damper your feelings about your work and who you are working with. When was the last time you really got away from screens and work and got some restorative rest away from the shop?<p>My advice is to head to a quiet space, go on a walk or a hike and think about some of these starter questions and their answers. This process will kindle some of your own questions as well. You might also try writing some things down, like a pro/con list of what you like and do not like about this job, and how it compares to your ideal situation. This process might serve to help you see things in a new perspective, in a different light.<p>I have found that the key is to break things down into their component parts, then work from there.<p>All the best.<p>--<p><i>Ask HN: I do not enjoy my job, what to do?</i><p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6327863"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6327863</a><p><i>Ask HN: Alternate Careers for a Software developer</i><p>[2] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6220534"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6220534</a>",1378824466

For example, some guys are pretty tough on tall women although most don&#x27;t care, and from a lifetime of locker room observation, those with the worst attitude toward the tall ladies statistically tend to be correspondingly unusually short in one particular physical attribute.<p>Given that, I would not be entirely surprised if the root cause of some anti-woman brogrammer behavior could be statistically highly correlated with one anatomical part being unusually small.  Aka if the girls are going to laugh at him anyway, may as well pre-emptively strike against them first, not much to lose.  Although why this behavior is seen more on the coasts than the midwest and the other civilized areas, is still unclear under this theory.  We may simply grow &#x27;em larger here thus less root cause for the anti-social behavior.  I do not have enough observational data, and frankly I&#x27;ve gathered it all inadvertently rather than intentionally.  A suitably geo-located chatroulette image analysis program might help.  Although a theory that seems to &quot;explain it all&quot; is highly appealing, it none the less may or may not be proven out by actual statistical research.  I would assume some sociologist with a ruler could probably figure it out for us, along with a questionnaire about brogrammers opinions about their physical self image (in other words they may not actually be shrunken mutants, but inaccurately think they are...).  I don&#x27;t think population migration necessarily disproves this theory; consider if hormone contamination in the water causes shrinkage or perhaps some other environmental toxins; the coasts certainly have plenty of environmental toxins compared to other areas.",1378824461

The name was the acronym for &quot;Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service&quot;[1] (as well as an allusion to ocean waves). The word &quot;emergency&quot; implied that the acceptance of women was due to the unusual circumstances of World War II, and at the end of the war the women would not be allowed to continue in Navy careers, but it or its successors continued for decades afterwards.</i><p><i>Within their first year, the WAVES were 27,000 strong. A large proportion of the WAVES did clerical work, but some took positions in the aviation community, medical professions, communications, intelligence, storekeeper, science and technology.</i><p><i>The WAVES could not serve aboard combat ships or aircraft, and initially were restricted to duty in the continental United States. Late in World War II, they were authorized to serve in certain U.S. possessions, and a number were sent to Hawaii. The war ended before any WAVES could be sent to other locations.</i><p>It wasn&#x27;t until six years after WAVES was formed on June 12 1948, women gained permanent status in the armed services. Grace Hopper absolutely wouldn&#x27;t have been welcome in the Navy if it wasn&#x27;t for World War II.

6360206,comment,6359892,6359892,12,0,logicallee,,,"The third comment (on the article) is interesting.  In theory, a &#x27;XOR&#x27; among sources of data is &#x27;secure&#x27; if any one of them is truly random.<p>Let&#x27;s look at this further.  Imagine you have a stream of entropy, and then you xor it with a second stream.  The first stream is secure (truly random) but the second stream is defective: it&#x27;s all 1&#x27;s.<p>Question: Do you now have a random stream, or is it biased towards 0&#x27;s or 1&#x27;s or in any other way?<p>Answer:  If they&#x27;re independent it&#x27;s secure.  Let&#x27;s see why.  In fact, you can consider the correct (random) stream as being a OTP on the plaintext which is all the rest.  In this case the &#x27;rest&#x27; is all 1&#x27;s, but it could be something partially random.  So, any random-enough source acts like an OTP on the final output - Except you throw away the key.<p>Naturally, as OTP&#x27;s are secure, the resulting &#x27;ciphertext&#x27; (looking at it as though it were an OTP operation) does not exhibit any evidence of the &#x27;all 1&#x27;s plaintext that you &quot;applied&quot; it to. It doesn&#x27;t matter what order you do the XOR&#x27;s, or how many are secure (random enough) and how many are insecure.[1]  So, if you have 27 sources of entropy you XOR by, then if any one of them are &#x27;random enough&#x27; then the output is &#x27;random enough&#x27;.<p>There&#x27;s just one problem: your output could be LESS random if the &#x27;random enough&#x27; &quot;key&quot; could somehow be recovered.  For example, if instead of all 1&#x27;s, for our second stream we XOR&#x27;d by a mirror of the first (otherwise secure) stream, then our results will be all 0: a horribly biased RNG.<p>So, if any of the 27 (or however many) sources &#x27;know&#x27; about the most random source, they can &#x27;undo&#x27; the entropy that is being added, and add hteir own.  so you might be XORing with a copy of the &#x27;random enough&#x27; source, netting all 0&#x27;s, and also xoring by the output of an encrypted output of an iterated counter, encrypted with, e.g. the NSA&#x27;s private key:<p>then to anyone that didn&#x27;t have the NSA&#x27;s private key it would look like the stream was still random enough.  But in fact, the entropy added by one source is removed in another.<p>The correct way around this is for hte sources to not have enough information about each other to be able to &#x27;leak&#x27; keys this way (undo entropy).<p>So the third comment on the article is very interesting in this light.<p>[1] XOR is commutative so you can rearrange the expression this way for any number of sources of entropy; it doesn&#x27;t matter which one is secure:  e.g. if D is secure in A XOR B XOR C XOR D XOR E XOR F, the output is still the same as (A XOR B XOR C XOR E XOR F) XOR D (by the commutative property) and therefore secure.",1378823375

By itself, LLVM IR has neither a &quot;send&quot; instruction, nor a &quot;call&quot; instruction with yield-semantics, and LLVM offers no tail-call elimination support. The JIT has to do a lot of pre-munging (dynamic recompilation) to produce code that LLVM can treat &quot;blindly&quot; as sequential machine-code. (LLVM also has a specific calling-convention implemented just for Erlang code, similar to the one it uses for Haskell code, since both generally avoid mutable state, which confuses LLVM&#x27;s regular register-allocator.)<p>Rust is a lot more like Go, with its multitasking primitives being based on channels (shared-memory atomic data structures) rather than message-passing-by-copying, and each actor/thread of execution allowing mutable state within itself, as long as its mutations don&#x27;t leak across actor boundaries. In other words, it doesn&#x27;t really change the semantics overmuch from that of the non-NUMA multicore Von Neumann machine (e.g. x86) it&#x27;s running on; it just does &quot;green threads&quot; the traditional way, with some elegant builtins for getting data from one to another.

1) I don&#x27;t fully understand how Android is stifling innovation in local-mobile services simply by having a dominant market share. From where I am standing (which admittedly, is in android&#x27;s favor as I very much enjoy using and developing for android) the platform is more open to development of advanced local-mobile services and applications due to fewer restrictions of background usage of sensors and services (vs. iOS, for example). In addition, I see Google pushing the envelope much more and much faster than iOS in terms of providing its own local-mobile services and applications (they&#x27;re potential data harvesting evil-ness aside).<p>2) Why do you trust Microsoft more than Google when they have pretty much blow-for-blow have equivalent services, applications, and (potential) scalability in online and mobile services? Is it simply because they have bought the Nokia devices and services division and are folding it under the Microsoft brand, making them a true hardware manufacturer (in the sense that they stand to benefit if they profit from hardware sales)? As I see it, the big three mobile companies (Apple, Google, MS - sorry BB) all now have their own top-to-bottom mobile stacks, except Google has kept Moto silo&#x27;d away from their core business. So are you simply pointing out that Google&#x27;s current business model is still to undercut in hardware prices (not try to profit) and make the rest up in services, while assuming that Microsoft will not go this route (they probably will)? Also, all that being said, Google&#x27;s hardware stance certainly appears to be changing if they really make a mainstream push for Glass and plan to start making their own hardware as they have hinted at (Glass, Pixel, Nexus Q, Moto X).",1378822032

Yes, if you are using a 64-bit hash, it only takes 2^32 tries to find a collsion via the birthday paradox.   This is a problem if you want to protect against random corruption.<p>But an attacker who is trying to subvert a system generally wants to replace a specific node in a content-based addressing scheme.  For example, they might want to replace a commit in a git tree.   In order to do this, you need to be able to carry out a 2nd pre-image attack.  That is, given a message m which hashes to h, you need to find another message m&#x27; which hashes to the same value.   In this case, the birthday attack doesn&#x27;t apply, because you can&#x27;t just find any collsion --- you need to find a collision given a specific hash value.   This is the difference between trying to find two people in a crowd that have the same birthday, and trying to find a single person in a crowd that has the same birthday as another, specific person in that crowd (say, May 14th).  The latter is far more difficult than the former.<p>So for example, even if git used MD5, for which a collision was demonstrated in 2005, a theoretical pre-image attack was only demonstrated in 2009, and even then it had a complexity of 2^123.   So you could replace a file in a git tree with another, but it would require trying 2^123 different messages --- only slightly better than a brute force search.   And even then, there is no guarantee that the replacement file would make any sense as a valid C file.<p>And of course, git is not using MD5; it&#x27;s using SHA-1.<p>It&#x27;s really unfortunate that Val&#x27;s compare-by-hash paper doesn&#x27;t go into this rather subtle point, because it causes people to get more excited than what the facts really warrant.",1378821924

The short, polite, version of my response is &quot;below average&quot;.  The longer version would be something like &quot;that is the worst pickup line I&#x27;ve ever heard and I&#x27;m married anyway, now go away I don&#x27;t talk to strangers with weird pickup lines&quot;.  Claiming to have a talent and refusing to express it by continuing the conversation would be considered pretty rude, its more polite just to blow off the questioner and claim not to be an expert.<p>I do this with home computer stuff all the time.

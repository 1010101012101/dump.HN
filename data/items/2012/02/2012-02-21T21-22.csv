This applies to anything that I want to place in a deeply-nested hierarchy which I already have open in Terminal or Finder but that would require effort in the open-save dialog.

They both move at 1 inch per tick of game clock in any direction.  To make things simple the the lion goes to the center of the ring, then aims for 2 inch closer to the ring than the tamer.  Well the tamer will either go closer to the wall or the lion get's closer to him every second.  But while he runs along the wall the lion takes a shorter path closer to the center of the ring, catches him and eats him.  Also, if the tamer ever goes closer to the center of the ring in any turn the lion get's closer to him that turn because the lion stays on a line between the center of the ring and the tamer.<p>The reason my example does not work for this puzzle is simply there is no distance closer the the center of the ring the lion can aim for and still get to eat him.

In the summer of 2011, I blogged for fun about home cooking: www.foodisloving.com.<p>Two things I would add to the article:<p>1) The decision to blog or not to blog should be rooted in how you plan to reach your target audience and prioritizing your expected returns. Since you only have so much time in the day though, you may find that it's more effective to market to your target audience using other means. If SEO and referrals links are important to you, then blogging is absolutely a great way to authentically build your status.<p>Mark's target audience are tech entrepreneurs who hungrily look for advice online about how to build their companies. Hence blogging is an ideal means for him to connect with his audience.<p>2) In deciding who at your company should blog, make sure that the designated blogger is efficient at writing understandable and eloquent prose. Table stakes are that the blog must be easy and (somewhat) fun to read. Then you layer in Mark's point about saying something of use to your target audience",1329859709

However, what is missing is some nice, reusable, simple UI set of elements for pivoting and drilling down. The idea is that apps can use Cubes as module for providing aggregation and drill-down capability. Then you have a front-end module, either within the app or any external, that can connect to the Cubes OLAP API and you can do reporting as you like.<p>I'm not too much front-end guy, so any help would be appreciated.

Everyone who's consuming this packet already has a function available which can parse url query parameters with arbitrary name/value pairs, and that's the format being used here. I'm also not sure that the user needs to turn this into a binary format before using it; a string comparison against ""75"" and ""0"" is just as capable and nearly as fast as a numeric comparison, especially if you're using a scripting language for your heartbeat monitor rather than C.",1329858308

Both pair programming and peer reviews (of code or otherwise) have the same aims and same results:<p>1) fewer bugs (peer reviews / pair programming is the most efficient known method to reduce the number of bugs, by far - testing is a distant second)<p>2) better spread of knowledge around the team<p>It's important to realise that they're the same tool, just twisted into a different shape. Pair programming is essentially taking the peer review concept and making it continuous rather than applying it at a regular interval.<p>In a startup environment, I'd recommend pair programming rather than code reviews, because it tends to provide a greater return, and it feels more nimble and fresh.<p>To ease yourself into it, you could start with pair programming days once a week, and see how people like it...<p>Daniel",1206033230

It includes an appointment scheduler (!) and has some sort of message button I've never pressed for fear of being reminded of what my voice sounds like.  Apparently the designers thought there was a large underserved market of families whose entire lives revolve around their microwaves.  All the buttons to support these extra features mainly make it less convenient to use for heating up food.<p>The worst feature by far is its insistence on having its clock set.  Every time I lose electricity, which happens every few weeks in my neighborhood, it refuses to cook anything until I:<p><pre><code>  1. Press ""clock"" to set the time (even though all other functions are disabled).
  2. Enter the time in HHMM format.
  3. Press ""start"" (but don't get too excited about actually ""starting"" anything yet).
  4. Locate the single-purpose ""AM/PM"" button and press that either once or twice.
  5. Press ""start"" again.
  6. Enter the date in MMDDYY format.
  7. And again press ""start"".
</code></pre>
What this means is that you can always calculate how long it has been since the first time I zapped my morning instant oatmeal after the last power outage by subtracting from the current time and date displayed by the microwave: 2011-11-11 11:11 a.m.<p>So, yeah, don't design a web site like that.",1206033059

3665351,comment,3661947,3662599,1,0,snikolov,,,"<i>Because most colleges teach ""computer science"" not ""software engineering"". Computer science is primarily about abstract concepts, and not so much about necessarily doing anything worthwhile with them</i><p>A computer science curriculum (even a theoretical one) need not consist only of abstract concepts. And it need not include software if the purpose is to have a theoretical curriculum. I've always been a fan projects whose primary purpose is to help you learn the concepts. My favorite courses have been of the type where the problem sets are: ""read this paper; understand it; implement the algorithms; write a report with results and discussion.""",1330919896
3665350,comment,3664908,3664945,1,0,akaalias,,,"Greetings, having lived with 2 roommates for a good time period, I was very interested checking out how you are trying to solve some of the issues surrounding it.<p>Here is my immediate feedback:<p>1. Overall looks good, professional enough to trust. (Personally, not a big fan of vanilla Bootstrap 2.0. But I'll hopefully be one in thousand users who even know what that is)<p>2. Awesome, a clear call to action! However, I was hesitant because besides a bunch of icons and paragraphs of promises, it's not tangible how it works and how you are solving issues better than a bunch of magnets, a fridge and small pieces of paper. Add a walk-through or at least a few screenshots.<p>3. Login with Facebook only (as noted by others) makes sense but I'm not a big fan of this being the only option. Case in point, one of my past roommates did not have a facebook account.<p>4. Join or create a ""Room"" -- Errr... This naming made no sense (to me) whatsoever. Why are you replacing 'shared residency' or 'house' or 'apartment' with 'room'? To me, this is silly and - in my interpretation - seems like an overly clever play on the words 'room' and 'roommates'. Unless of course, you think we all sleep in bunk-beds in the same physical room (which, if you live in New York City is a possibility).<p>Okay, so I am now on my dashboard, I understand that my other roommates need to be invited. Okay. Instead, I'd like to poke around a bit first. I'd like to schedule/add chores, some existing bills, todos etc. so that, when they join, there is something to use/look at. Hm, that doesn't work because of some before_filter requires me to have them join first. That's a no-go for me.<p>Right now, I still have _no_ _idea_ how this thing works, what kind of forms/options you are going to give me and if they apply to the specific real-world situation (since there was nothing to be seen or checked-out pre-registration).<p>Because of the requirement of invitation, I can't move forward checking out what it does, so I'm losing interest quickly and am bound to leave and possibly never return.<p>Keep up! Looking forward to the next iteration :)",1330919895

You won't believe how many people have a similar opinion about JQuery and Javascript these days.<p>A few days back I wanted to use a object oriented language for a big project. Generally I straight away go and use Perl for all my experiments. But since this time I wanted Java programmers to be working with my project later I thought let me use Python as its more syntactically closer to Java. When I started coding, my manager peeked over my shoulder and asked if it was Python in which I was coding I replied yes. He immediately asked me to stop writing in it, as he thinks writing in 2.x is waste of time as it is going to go away, 3.x is not yet having all the libraries. And writing 2.x will force a huge rewrite effort later. I tried and reasoned enough to convince other wise. But alas, it didn't fly.<p>That is how it works with pointy haired managers. They read something some where and then hold strong opinions about a particular technology.<p>As programmers we can try and educate people in forums like these.<p>But managers don't read these forums.

In other words, the programmer makes a mistake and therefore there is a security hole.  The problem with this approach is that programmers make mistakes all the time.<p>Certainly it is impossible to take all the weight off the programmer's shoulders.  Mistakes will always allow a program to be misused, misdirected, and so forth.  However, most security issues are best solved as architecture problems, not as developer problems.<p>For example input sanitation is generally a bad idea* beyond certain things we should never see in inputs.  It's far better to find ways of making the input safe to the database and to the web interface that doesn't depend on it being sanitized on input.<p>* This is because you can only sanitize based on how you want things to go on output, whether you are outputting from your program to the db or to a user interface of some sort.  If you sanitize for HTML, you can't use the same info reasonably well for LaTeX, etc.....<p>So I am of the considered opinion that data should be checked for basic sanity on input (no termination sequences in the middle of input strings, etc), and escaped on use or output.  If you have a framework to do this, then you centralize that logic so you don't have to think about it every time.  This drastically cuts down on things like XSS, SQL Injection, and the like.<p>This sort of thing again strikes me as something the framework should prevent.  That's not necessarily a flaw of Rails if you use Rails as a toolkit for your own application frameworks.  However, it is an architectural flaw, not a programming mistake.",1330919068

Here is my take on your question(s).<p>Mini Coopers are cheap ""premium"" cars, in a sense that they are indirectly marketed as if they were mini BMWs (they are made by BMW), but they are just the equivalent of a volkswagen in terms of quality (which is pretty bad from professional experience). They are built using cheap parts, that are even too flimsy to even use (it is not an exageration, but actual experience).<p>Porsche is a brand that is driven by engineering, but engineering != reliability. Even though they have improved a lot in the last 5-6 years, they are not sold for their reliability, but for their performance. The Boxster is a specially good example of how not to build a cheap sports car when all you do is build premium sports cars. The best example of those shoddy quality of the Boxster (first generation) is the engine that self-destructed due to an improperly machined engine part (the case). Sadly, some 911 owners also got a bad engine with the 1999 model carrera equipped with the 3.4 engine (ddg it). The engine goes for about 12k when sourced from Porsche, not including installation.<p>Honda does not make cars that don't break. They have problems too. The Accord suffered from a defect in the engine block cylinders that cause it to warp the deck surface and thus make the car overheat (it required you to buy a new engine, because this was not serviceable).\nThe S2000 has a transmission made out of glass (not really, but you get my point(it is prone to failure on the first, second and third gear grear set)).<p>Mercedes does have the ussual electronic gremlic (just like most European cars), because they have extremely short development cycles, and you just can't test so much stuff at once (they ship a lot of buggy hardware, if you will). One of my favorites is the C240 Kompressor, which had a supercharged engine that blew up if you used a fuel that did not meet the octane requirements. Why didn't Mercedes just let the computer retard the ignition timing to compensate for the lack of octane? Wait, they did! They just didn't do enough of it (they did not test it throughly, and they also used parts that could not withstand a simple engine backfire ( a backfire is more lethal on cars that use supercharger or turbochargers, as it sends an explosion through the intake manifold (where the supercharger/turbocharger intake is)))(this comment looks like LISP code).<p>tl;dr: cheap parts, cheap engineering and cheap testing that derive from extreme cost-cutting measures make most brands out there a russian roullette. Good for mechanics, but bad for owners. Though with European cars, its as if you were playing Russian roullette with two bullets instead of one.<p>PS.If you do get the S2000, install a transmission oil cooler to extend the life of the tramsission components. The later years with the 2.4 engine had stronger transmissions, but a lower readline (and less peaky powerband (something people loved about the first generation (because it felt like a motorcycle/F1 engine))).<p>=)",1330916772

It does however have everything to do with the info reader being totally unusable. From the texinfo documentation (Read through the info reader.):<p>"" This all probably seems insultingly simple so far, but _please don't_ start skimming. Things will get complicated soon enough!  Also, please do not try a new command until you are told it is time to.  You could make Info skip past an important warning that was coming up.""<p>It's a bloody <i>text reader</i>. It shouldn't ever get ""complicated"". For that matter, it has the most obnoxious scrolling ever. It's hard to tell where one page starts and the other ends. (Contrast with: Less.) I shouldn't have to memorize keyboard shortcuts to navigate. (At least not in a system that wants to be used and supported by anyone who <i>isn't</i> the most hardcore of users.)<p>On top of that, part of the reason I can't use the texinfo reader is because it very often doesn't have the ""info"" I want. And just takes me to the top node or whatever. So let me go ahead and append to ""As for backwards compatibility"". The system should also be able to take and render man pages as though you were using man, because expecting 30 years of projects to all move to <i>any</i> new system is ridiculous. And supporting man page format really shouldn't be that hard.<p>The closest thing to what I'm thinking of is something like the links web browser. Which still falls short. And with all that in mind, it's not like I expect anyone else to do it. Thats probably like the first rule of project ideas. Unless you do it, it won't be done the way you want it to be.",1330916585

I think framing it as 'the open and free internet won the fight against the state-controlled, for-pay, closed minitel', as sometimes happens, is one of those things that make a lot of sense in retrospect, but in its day the minitel was clearly a winner.",1242111448

The next one will (hopefully) be more peaceful & market driven. Space flights for tourism provide a few of these increment. Asteroid-mining might be another. Military probably has a few more to play.<p>None of these have been paying much dividends in the last 30-40 years.<p>The <i>of protocols and business rules humans create</i> may be capitalism (or some sort of cousin).

a web app in it though. It's just the right tool for certain

2) Non-animated images under a particular size
3) Not served by blacklisted domains
4) Or listed by a whitelist-----<p>--------<i>screeecchhh</i> stopping myself right there, new thought:<p>What about a plugin which annotates ads with thumbs up and thumbs down buttons.

604991,comment,604686,604891,0,0,ccpascu,,,"Hey, Cristian here, developer of FlairBuilder.<p>It's true that early in the process is not OK to spend to much time on details. You'll just want to grab a pencil and a sheet of paper (or a digital equivalent as Balsamiq Mockups) and sketch down as many ideas as you need.<p>However, there is a point/stage where you'll need to dig down into the details, as many as possible to make sure, again as much as possible, that you got the requirements right.<p>Another thing: IMHO there is a clear difference between an wireframe and a prototype. With both you can go from plain, or even sketchy look'n'feel up to a polished design.<p>FlairBuilder aims to bring the amount of interactivity that coded prototypes have (for proper usability and user feedback ), with the plain simple look'n'feel of wireframes.<p>Cheers,
Cristian",1242110874
604990,comment,604379,604912,0,0,yish,,,"Actually this for me is an issue, I use email search all the time, primarily for when I travel and have to look up various confirmations codes, reservations, etc.  I also email myself all the time with notes, links, etc. The only issue I am having is that 
  1) Gmail works quite well for me right now 
  2) I don't want to pay $4 a month for this
  3) Another company with access to my email
However, while the app is free I will definitely test it out especially appreciating Gabor's replies and comments here and elsewhere.  If it's truly faster and also provides me effective offline access to the info I really need, well I would still have an issue paying $50 a year for it, but at least it would be a consideration.",1242110808

Once one subscribes to a label, it invites toeing the party line and switching off the brain. Hackers are even nervous, it seems, about accepting the label ""hacker"".<p>Rand, like Marx presented a cartoonish, plastic version of reality that seems compelling at first but when considered carefully fails the test of being practical (or possible) to implement. After you get some distance you start to see the bits of reality that have been fictionalized and over-emphasized. Like using a parametric EQ on your favorite song to learn the bass line.<p>Hackers will generally accept people of any political makeup so long as their reasoning is clear and systematic and their initial assumptions are reasonable. They won't accept beliefs based on dogma, anecdotes, or superstition. This is why the hacker community tends to be so diverse yet seems to have so much cohesion. (So much, in fact, that the near total lack of venomous idealogical bickering might fool the uninitiated into thinking everyone must just believe the same as them.)",1242109460

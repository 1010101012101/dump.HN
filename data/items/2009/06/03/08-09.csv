639452,comment,639330,639330,0,0,axod,,,"Interesting article.<p>Threads should always be an absolute last resort. Programmers working on concurrency, locking, etc are often solving self inflicted problems. I don't know why they do it.<p>edit:<p>I've mentioned it in the past, and I do hate harping on about mibbit ;) but I had a similar experience there - as you can imagine, a large amount of dns lookups (both forward and reverse) are required. First version used a single separate thread to do them. Had to do lots of synchronization in the callback. 2nd ver had a threadpool, which was even more complex. Still slow as hell.<p>Final version, and the version in use now uses async nio in the main network thread, and is as fast as fast can be. The code is far simpler/faster than the threaded version, and handles thousands of lookups with minimum of fuss. There's just an initial investment of writing dns packet+udp code (Not rocket science).<p>At first glance, threads often seem like the 'easy' option. Often they're not. In my example, it was far easier just to knuckle down and write a simple async dns client than constantly mess around with concurrency issues and try and get it to go fast.<p>The code in this article looks horrible to work with, and reminds me of how my first version looked :/",1244019342

639447,comment,638752,638794,0,0,ryah,,,"> Are Node people going to reimplement event-driven MySQL client from scratch or what?<p>No. MySQL does not provide an API that is usable with an event-loop, so it will need to be run in a separate internal thread. It will notify the main thread when it is complete. With Postgres the situation is better, they have a very nice API that can be integrated into an event loop, so the extra overhead won't be necessary.",1244018814

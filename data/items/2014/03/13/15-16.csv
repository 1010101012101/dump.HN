7392661,comment,7389940,7390786,1,0,briantakita,,,"I&#x27;d like the flip that thinking on it&#x27;s head a bit. It&#x27;s not about &quot;average&quot; or &quot;better or worse&quot; than average. The need to put yourself and others into some sort of ranking stems from the need to categorize everything into a hierarchy.<p>I&#x27;m talking about something more binary. Good or bad. Progress or stagnation. The right or wrong side of history.<p>I&#x27;m also talking about power. Who determines engineering practice. The engineers or the marketers?<p>Evidence of power is in the corporate hierarchy. Are there n tiers of middle management? Can an engineer truly make a difference at a company? Will the engineer be able to have a voice in what the priority is?",1394726362

Assuming that the family is young, that would buy one of the better pre-ACA plans in my state (Washington). I have no idea how old the parent is.<p>Of course, that won&#x27;t buy a comparable post-ACA plan.

If you live in most of the big centers, you pay as much tax as Europeans, and receive almost nothing in welfare benefits (whereas your European peer will receive tens of thousands of dollars, if not more, in government services over a lifetime). If I didn&#x27;t have health insurance through my spouse&#x27;s employer, I&#x27;d be paying $1,600/mo in student loan minimum payments and catastrophic plan health insurance (which will only get more expensive as I get older and have children). Add that on top of federal taxes, payroll taxes (self-employed, so I have to pay both sides), New York state and New York city taxes (NYC conveniently double-taxes S-corp earnings, btw), and I&#x27;m paying far more than any European would in my position.<p>Doing business is also a huge headache, with so many different taxes to navigate, on the federal, state, and local level. Payroll taxes are a joke. Why not just collect it along with FICA and earmark it at the government level? Because politics. They think, if you label the tax &quot;Medicare&quot; or &quot;Social Security,&quot; they won&#x27;t think of it as a tax but rather a savings account. Right.<p>And I&#x27;m a lawyer! I can&#x27;t imagine how much precious capital is wasted on CPAs and attorneys by small business owners trying to start a business the right way.<p>More and more I realize that the US is actually quite <i>mediocre</i> at many things, especially governance, not exceptional. What we are is a huge homogeneous market, and that&#x27;s where much of our wealth comes from.",1394726223

But in comparison to estimates on things like coal or climate, the population growth models are almost trivially simple, and while the numbers are adjusted up and down regularly to account for actual data, all data we have show the population growth consistently slowing down.<p>For starters, one of the things that make the population models straightforward compared to a lot of other things we might try to model, is that we can compare countries, and as it happens there are patterns that have consistently applied to countries as they develop, and that we have detailed data on: As life expectancy increases, growth rates drop to near or below maintenance rates.<p>Unless the remaining countries with rapid growth are somehow drastically different, it would take massive, earth-shattering changes for the population growth not to stop. It&#x27;s not realistically a question of <i>if</i> it stops, but <i>when</i> and <i>how high</i> the peak will be, and how much the population will fall back afterwards before growth resumes (the expectation is that it will fall back because we get a &quot;bulge&quot; similar to what we&#x27;re seeing these days due to the baby-boomer generation, and eventually the people in that bulge will start to die off).<p>Even many developing countries have long ago entered into the phase where it is not birth rates that is the cause of ongoing growth, but improving life expectancy, which means that their growth will eventually stop.<p>And with countries like China heading rapidly towards contraction as early as 2030 (with net growth now down to around 1/3 of its peak in the mid 80&#x27;s, driven by a fertility rate far below maintenance), even the remaining high growth countries would have to dramaticall raise their population growth if we are to continue seeing overall growth.",1394725914

Think Fortune 500 companies developing internal software tools here; a lot of these guys are still stuck in the &quot;we release software every year and hope the requirements haven&#x27;t changed&quot; mindset. Meanwhile the &quot;customer&quot; expectations have changed: people expect faster releases because Google, Facebook, Netflix, etc. update their shit every month. The business environment changes quickly too; the old development ways just aren&#x27;t fast enough to keep up.<p>Agile helps force groups like this, who have been doing things a certain way for a long time, to re-think how they manage requirements and release schedules. Most likely, the developers at the bottom level have been screaming about this for years, but middle management doesn&#x27;t hear them because they&#x27;re stuck in meetings all day having to explain why all their projects are over budget because change management costs are through the roof. Along comes Agile as a solution to all of this.<p>This isn&#x27;t a technical problem, it&#x27;s a management problem.

7392588,comment,7391734,7392399,3,0,jeffdavis,,,"Why does buying and selling buildings cost money?<p>First of all, it can take some effort to find a buyer. This effort needs to be expended regardless, and I don&#x27;t see how it&#x27;s better to in-source the work to the selling government agency. They are not professional brokers, have little incentive to act quickly or efficiently, and we&#x27;ve already established that they don&#x27;t have any magical database that makes the buyer obvious. Just let a commercial RE broker handle it like a business would.<p>Second, you need to settle-up the accounting so it&#x27;s no longer on the seller&#x27;s books, and is now on the buyer&#x27;s books. That means you need to agree to a price. You can skip this because &quot;it&#x27;s all part of the federal government&quot;, but that leaves us with the mess we have now: nobody knows what buildings are being used by whom at what cost. Accounting costs are not waste; otherwise large private (not publicly-traded) companies would fire their accountants. So it seems like the best course of action is to do the same negotiation and accounting work that happens as a part of the sale.<p>So the buying/selling costs are not a waste, they are money well-spent. It&#x27;s possible to make them more efficient in special circumstances -- maybe the costs of due diligence, fraud prevention, title insurance, etc. are little or nothing when buying from the federal government. But those special cases can be handled as special cases and there could be a cheaper, quicker path to sell if those circumstances are met.",1394725826

The first &quot;close to $100,000&quot; (the amount changes annually for inflation) of income you earn abroad is free of income tax in the USA.<p>The hard part is knowing whether you qualify for this or not.  You need to be physically out of the USA for 330/365 days in a 12 month period (not a calendar year--this is stupidly overly complicated and tricky), or be a &quot;bona fide resident&quot; of the other country.  Look at the instructions on the form to help you here.  Most people fail on this point, and this is the first vector of attack by the government to try and tax you.<p>CAUTION CAUTION CAUTION.  I see any number of Americans abroad who work as self-employed independent contractors.  Oh, hypothetically, software engineers living in Thailand and working.  They successfully spend 330 days out of the USA.  They use Form 2555 to eliminate income tax on their Schedule C self-employment income.<p>But Form 2555 _does_ _not_ _eliminate_ the self-employment tax -- the equivalent of Social Security tax for self-employed people.  See Schedule SE.<p>Sorry for using all caps and fakey-fake underlining to emphasize this problem.  It happens all the time.  I saw it yesterday.  You think you have no tax liability and you end up owing $16,000 for self-employment tax.  Not fun.  At all.<p>The next magic form to remember is Form 1116.  This is the foreign tax credit.  If you earn a dollar of income in Japan and pay Japanese income tax on it, Uncle Sam will give you credit on your U.S. tax return for the Japanese income tax you paid.<p>This is usually the better way for Americans abroad to go when they live in high-tax countries.  This is why Americans in Europe pay many thousands of dollars to have a tax return prepared but never give Uncle Sam a nickel of tax.<p>If you are an American abroad working for a foreign employer, you don&#x27;t have to pay U.S. Social Security.

7392368,comment,7390736,7392155,9,0,philiphodgen,,,"The answer is yes.  You will face some variation on the problems that OP described in his post.<p>The level of paperwork and pain you will face depends on (1) where you are &quot;doing business&quot; (and that is a nuanced phrase); (2) what type of business you are doing; and (3) the humans who are doing the work -- U.S. residents or nonresidents.<p>The problems arise from the multiple government entities that have the ability to impose tax on a business.  From the top:<p>- income tax from the Federal government, (most) State governments, and (a few) cities.<p>- various employment taxes to fund government retirement benefits, unemployment relief, medical care for the elderly, etc. etc.  This is Federal and State.  Solve that problem by handing the whole f-ing problem off to a company that specifies in payroll services.  Hint:  despite marketing promises to the contrary, all payroll services are alike, except for the ones that steal your money.  Buy services from an established, reputable payroll services company.<p>- sales tax.  There are a maddening number of jurisdictions nationwide that impose sales tax at a maddeningly different set of rates.  Some things are taxed in one place and not in another.  My experience with the California bureaucracy that administers this tax is that they are the second-lowest level of Dante&#x27;s hell.  (The lowest level of hell is reserved for the employment tax bureaucracy).<p>- City business licenses.  It never ceases to astonish me how stupid local governments can be.  The City of Los Angeles imposes a tax on the privilege of running a business within the City limits.  It is a percentage of gross revenue, FFS.  Yet adjacent cities (I&#x27;m in one--Pasadena) charges a vastly smaller tax, based on number of employees.  A business can save tens of thousands of dollars simply by putting its offices in the correct place.  Then the City of Los Angeles has budget woes and wonders why.  Oh, well.  The immediately former Mayor has his name in big-ass letters in the international terminal at LAX.  C-o-r-r-u-p-t-i-o-n.  But I do not judge.  And I am not bitter.  :-)<p>Having said all of that, it IS possible to create an outpost in the United States and keep the paperwork and tax burden semi-sane.  Assuming your business generates some kind of software, I would do the following:<p>1.  Choose your base of operations in the USA on purely business grounds.  Where are your potential employees?  Where are your potential customers.  Let&#x27;s say it&#x27;s California.<p>2.  Next, examine carefully the different municipal governments in your target area to see which cities have the best city business license set-ups.  You might find that these places are popular and rent is expensive.  Go figure.<p>3.  Next set up the business entity you need.  If your company in Canada is a corporation, you almost certainly will use a corporation in the USA.  (Hint:  ignore everyone who tells you about LLCs.  CRA treats U.S. LLCs as corporations for tax purposes.  Just set up a corporation).  First preference is to set up the corporation in the State where you are actually doing business.  It saves you money and paperwork.  Success in business is all about avoiding paperwork.<p>4.  The U.S. corporation should probably be owned by your Canadian corporation.<p>5.  Staffing the U.S. corporation with employees.  If you are coming across the border you will need a visa.  Look at the TN visa or the L-1A visa categories as the easiest way to be here, work, and live.  If you are hiring locals, you don&#x27;t need a visa for them, obviously.<p>6.  F-ing payroll taxes.  Hire a giant-ass payroll services company.  I have used one after another and they have all f&#x27;d up my payroll at one point or another.  F-ing Intuit&#x27;s f-ing QuickBooks Payroll is the worst.  &quot;Oh, we really can&#x27;t track that $120,000 and can&#x27;t really tell you where it went.&quot;  But I am not bitter.  Really.  Not much, anyway.  :-)<p>7.  Hyper hyper critical for you coming across the border and working here:  payroll taxes.  You have to contribute to the U.S. Social Security system with your taxes even though you will never get a penny of benefits here.  There is a treaty with Canada.  Look for &quot;totalization agreement&quot; in your favorite search engine.  You can eliminate U.S. Social Security taxes for 5 years using that method.<p>8.  Your business SHOULD -- for certain definitions of &quot;should&quot; -- pay income tax to the Federal government and the State of California.  If you have a sufficiently high level of business activities in other states, they will want to impose income tax on your profits, too.  Strive to avoid those activities in the other states.  That&#x27;s where you need guidance.<p>I hope that helps.  My email is in my profile.",1394724082

The people of Nebraska really, really want that. So much so that if their senators can&#x27;t push it through, they&#x27;ll likely vote them out of office. So those senators trade every favor they have to get it through, which usually means voting for keeping a military base open in Colorado, funding road work and pipelines in Texas, building a new airport in Oklahoma, etc.<p>That&#x27;s how we get such a bloated federal budget. It&#x27;s why Congress wants to build a whole bunch of tanks for the Army that they have said they don&#x27;t need. It&#x27;s really more of a tragedy of the commons situation than inefficiency.<p>IMO the question shouldn&#x27;t be &quot;how can we lower our tax burden&quot;, it should be &quot;how do we get more value out of our tax dollars.&quot; That may mean increasing the tax burden. There&#x27;s a sweet spot between socialism and capitalism, and IMO we&#x27;re swinging a bit far towards capitalism right now. I&#x27;m not saying we should go full-on welfare state, but our infrastructure is crumbling and people are losing faith in the American dream, yet companies are more profitable than ever.<p>It&#x27;s also important to recognize that government accounting is substantially different from normal corporate accounting. Governments can literally print money if they need to do so to cover debts (and thus shift the burden of debt repayment onto all holders of their currency). The flip side of that is that governments have such a massive scale, they tend to absorb a lot of economy-scale losses (such as building vacancies) that businesses wouldn&#x27;t have to, so their balance sheets look awful.",1394723854

Also I made the unfortunate mistake of using JavaDB/Derby as the datastore, thinking I had no need for a full RDBMS, I&#x27;ll never make that mistake again, it&#x27;s the most pathetic excuse for a db ever (I&#x27;ve used Oracle, MSSQL, Sybase, MySQL and Sqlite in the past, so I have some perspective on the matter)<p>So I began looking for alternatives, as a result v2 is written in Python (Flask/REST producing JSON, a simple wrapper around TornDB querying a MySQL db) which is consumed and presented by the Javascript/HTML front end using AngularJS. I re-implemented everything V1 had from scratch in under three days and was ready to begin adding the new features. By comparison the initial implementation in Java had taken me several weeks. Obviously some of that is to be expected, its easier to re-write than write. But I come away now feeling that Java & Glassfish made me jump through hoops to accomplish something that should have been simple, and I was certainly guilty of chosing the wrong tool for the job, but Java was what I knew best at the time.",1394723849

College basketball, in particular. IIRC, the preconditions for a fixed game tended to be:<p>- Non-tournament, regular season play (b/c not as many bettors and media would be paying attention)<p>- The favorite team is favored by 11 or more points<p>- The favorite team is dominated by one or two very strong players<p>If one player controls his team&#x27;s play, and he&#x27;s favored by 11+ points, he has the incentive, the ability, and the margin to shave points without risking losing the game. With a smaller point spread, on the other hand, it&#x27;s too risky. For reasons I can&#x27;t recall, an 11-point spread was the magic number. It provided just enough cushion to cover shaving, without jeopardizing the nominal win.<p>When analysts looked at the history of games that met these criteria, they found consistently abnormal distributions of outcomes in favor of the winning team, but just south of the spread. They estimated that about 3-4% of games in the study sample are quite likely to have been fixed.<p>At any rate, it would be interesting to see bigger data sets plied for this sort of thing.",1394723258

(I am an American native speaker of English who has been learning Chinese as a second language since I was a teenager in the 1970s. My HN user profile discloses other languages I have studied over the years.) So, yeah, I guess he&#x27;s doing not half badly. You won&#x27;t fail to notice that Benny speaks MUCH more slowly than the native speaker of Chinese he &quot;interviews,&quot; and after the prepared remarks he uses to open up the interview, and a few personal stories about himself, he hardly interacts with the native speaker of Chinese except to say &quot;uh-huh.&quot; (You will also not fail to notice that the Chinese woman he is interviewing knows English, and presumably has spoken Chinese to other Americans with thick accents before.)<p>I think the rule of language learning in the blog post that has the most plausibility is &quot;#8 – Embrace mistakes.&quot; (The interview subject basically says this to Benny in the interview, that he has a good habit of immediately using the language he learns, which he learns to use, and uses bravely.) I know an American man whose first visit to east Asia was simply to use up a one-way portion of an airplane ticket a friend gave him. He arrived in Taiwan in 1982 not knowing a word of Chinese, and having a thick south Boston (specifically Quincy, I think) accent that made his English sound strange to most Americans who met him. But he was very bold in striking up conversations with local people in Taiwan, and practiced his Modern Standard Chinese (Mandarin) relentlessly, so he gradually outpaced a lot of more shy Americans in his actual communication proficiency. He eventually found work in a high-tech company operated mostly by Hong Kong Chinese people, and has had a very satisfying career working both in east Asia and on the west coast of the United States. I was DELIGHTED to remake acquaintance with him by LinkedIn a few years ago and to endorse his language ability. He earned it.<p>Of course Benny is promoting his new book, and here is a link to some press coverage generated by his publicity efforts:<p><a href=""http://metro.co.uk/2014/03/13/benny-lewis-the-man-who-says-you-can-learn-a-language-in-three-months-4545062/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://metro.co.uk/2014/03/13/benny-lewis-the-man-who-says-y...</a><p>Perhaps the statement in the article, &quot;Lewis says: ‘The problem here, though, is that if you have such high criteria for fluency, then I have to confess, I’m not even fluent in English, my native language’&quot; helps put his claims in context.",1394723245

I&#x27;d never studied Italian before (but French and Latin, yes) and just simply turning up and having to struggle through reading and writing emails in Italian, talking to people in Italian, even terribly broken and incorrect Italian, has done for me in 6 months what would have taken about 8 years of non-intensive study. My grammar isn&#x27;t great but that&#x27;s for lack of actively studying it, I&#x27;m too busy. Even still, I self-correct all the time and my conversational and comprehension skills are comparatively through the roof. There really is no substitute for immersion and practice. The more familiar with something you become, the more you start to recognise patterns and where your own styles fall down -- you start to notice that others use certain prepositions in a context where you&#x27;d use a different one, and you check and self-correct. All the time you&#x27;re getting better and more comfortable with the whole process; listening, speaking, pronunciation, stringing more and more complex sentences together. It&#x27;s a holistic process and there is simply no substitute for jumping in the deep end, and the more organic and &#x27;real&#x27; it can be, the better. A stale classroom a few times a week is almost doing you a disservice by making you think you&#x27;re studying -- you might be better off saving your time until you can commit yourself to it properly (for e.g. reading a newspaper every day, speaking for an hour every day with a native speaker, reading and writing in forums/IRC in that language).",1394723037

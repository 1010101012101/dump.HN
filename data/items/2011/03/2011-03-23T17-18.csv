I've been specifically told, by a VP (who was one of the early employees), not to refactor code which very much needed it, because the engineering resources were needed elsewhere.  There've been other times where I've made the call on my own not to cleanup dirty code, and it was 100% the right decision, because we never touched that code again.  There've been still other times that I look at code Jeff Dean or Craig Silverstein wrote and say ""This is a piece of shit"" - encapsulation violations all over the place, an API that encourages you to do the slow thing (after micro-optimizing for efficiency everywhere else), complicated object ownership semantics.  And then I remember that they probably wrote it in a day, for requirements very different than we're facing now, and cut them some slack.<p>The operative word there is ""sometimes"".  It's a very useful skill to be able to make a judgment call and say ""This code is peripheral; we're unlikely to touch it again"" or ""This code is temporary; we'll replace it in 3 months"" or ""This code is critical; it better be rock solid, because 500 developers will be changing it every day and learning how to program from it.""<p>The point the article makes is that a manager doesn't have all the information, because they're not the ones who look at the code all day.  And the point <i>I'm</i> making is that a developer doesn't have all the information either, because they're often not aware of the opportunity cost of fixing that code.  What other features could you have implemented in the time it takes to write those unit tests?  What other markets could you tap instead of fixing your integer overflows?<p>There's a peculiar kind of survivorship bias when looking at code.  The fact that you're being paid to look at it means that it was successful enough to actually get users.  Usually, that means some sort of trade-offs to actually get to market; the people who spend time writing unit tests and figuring out the perfect design get beaten by competitors who don't (trust me, this happened to my first startup).

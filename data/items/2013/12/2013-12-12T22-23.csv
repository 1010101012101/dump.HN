6897882,comment,6865220,6865220,1,0,thaifighter,,,"I like the idea, but I&#x27;m not sure this can work. The first thing you should do is try to poke as many holes in this idea as possible, then close them and build the case as to why this would work. One problem I see is that it might hyperfocus demand toward a small number of base consumption items <i>if</i> a larger than anticipated number of recipients do decide to not work. This could inflate the price of these basic items and put the poorest in society back into the same boat of not having quite enough money to sustain themselves (having to pay the higher price for goods that they previously could afford etc). Then, we&#x27;d have to revisit raising the basic income level every 3-5 years instead of 8-12 years. Along with ridiculous debt ceiling fights, we&#x27;d also have basic income fights.<p>If it&#x27;s set up to avoid these fights by being indexed to the rate of inflation, people will lose ground over the long haul, since wages tend to rise faster than inflation (and if we index it to wages, it creates a problem currently being discussed with respect to social security) and those pressures from wages might ultimately drive the price of goods out of reach for those who rely on their basic income.<p>You might also see irrational behavior on the part of some recipients, where they buy nonessential items (iphones, hdtvs, etc) and choose to go hungry or even homeless. Econ likes to assume rational behavior, but that&#x27;s only so it can fit into a nice model. Fact is, plenty of people act irrationally, and while it&#x27;s easy to ignore them in a model, it&#x27;s hard to when they&#x27;re sleeping along the street or in your stairwell.<p>And what would we do with them? Put them in jail? Force them to spend only on essential goods? If we force them to spend on essentials, aren&#x27;t we just calling it welfare by a different name? The state can&#x27;t let them just linger, because their loitering has costs of it&#x27;s own, not limited to growing social unrest (this is partly why privatizing social security is such a horrible idea -- the market might fail and the state will still have to bail out people&#x27;s private pensions or risk unrest, probably gaining nothing but added uncertainty in the long term).<p>Our system just might function optimally when its set up to let people choose to fail, as some surely will, and to make it just painful enough to encourage moving one&#x27;s self out of poverty.<p>Playing devil&#x27;s advocate here. A shift like this would seem to have very little margin for error.",1386889178

6897879,comment,6895300,6895630,6,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Titan is known to contain oceans, but of nearly cryogenically cold hydrocarbons. It&#x27;s unlikely to support life merely due to the temperatures there.<p>Many planetary bodies are thought to have sub-surface water oceans of some variety, though Europa&#x27;s is the most intriguing for several reasons. Given that Europa&#x27;s surface is entirely water ice and geologically quite young that is a strong indication that Europa&#x27;s sub-surface ocean is vast, warm, and consistently liquid over geological time periods. If, for example, Ganymede&#x27;s ocean were as large and as warm then why has it not risen to the surface and formed an ice layer? This is backed up by the fact that Europa experiences an intense amount of tidal heating from it&#x27;s galilean moon neighbors.<p>Because of this high amount of tidal heating, which on the neighboring moon Io is sufficient to cause widespread vulcanism, there is a reasonably good chance of significant hydrothermal vent systems within the Europan ocean. We&#x27;ve found on Earth that such vents can support chemotrophic life (through sulphides and serpentinization) which can support complex ecosystems which include animals such as shrimp and clams.<p>That isn&#x27;t to say that other bodies may not harbor substantial sub-surface oceans or support extra-terrestrial life, but the case for Europa is that much stronger and so that much more a compelling target for investigation.",1386889139

6897873,comment,6896080,6897709,1,0,dragonwriter,,,"> The total electricity used in Bitcoin mining is pegged to the bitcoin supply<p>No, its not. &quot;Mining&quot; is a misleading term based on the early-phase reward. A better name for the function would be &quot;providing resources for transaction processing&quot;. In the early phase, the reward is new bitcoins (hence, &quot;mining&quot; as the common name for the process), in the late phase it becomes transaction fees.<p>>  And transaction fees shouldn&#x27;t change this too much. Competition amongst miners should eventually drive those towards zero too.<p>Competition among miners only drives transaction fees to zero if there are a large number of miners compared to the number of transactions -- i.e., if either usage <i>isn&#x27;t</i> high or lots of people are dedicating resources to mining (and thus, electricity usage isn&#x27;t going to zero.)<p>>  It&#x27;s not just bookkeeping that&#x27;s happening, it&#x27;s dispute resolution.<p>No, its just bookkeeping.<p>> Currently your financial disputes are solved by calling your credit card company and having them deal with it.<p>True for certain classes of financial disputes when credit cards are used, but not generally the case. But, whatever.<p>> There&#x27;s a whole network of dispute resolution services going all the way up to the SCOTUS. All of which uses resources. Bitcoin does all that through mining.<p>No, it does not do the same function as the entire court system in terms of financial dispute resolution. Disputes involving Bitcoin are still resolved through the legal process. In fact, the absence of chargeback like mechanisms means that any disputes require escalation to more expensive mechanisms of dispute resolution sooner.<p>(Now, if transactions are done in a manner which is anonymous, dispute resolution may be practically impossible in the same way that that can be become the case if you are doing anonymous drops to exchange cash and goods -- but that doesn&#x27;t mean that mining is fulfilling the dispute resolution function, just that you&#x27;ve adopted a protocol which excludes dispute resolution.)",1386889039
6897872,comment,6895502,6896108,4,0,zhemao,,,"This probably varies greatly team-by-team. After all, it&#x27;s a big company. I interned at Amazon over the summer, too, and basically did the same thing you did. However, I did get a return offer at the end. Sounds like you were unlucky and had a bad experience with your team, and I&#x27;m sorry about that. But I will say that what makes the difference probably is communication. You were probably working enthusiastically and producing great code, but did your manager know that? Meanwhile, I wasn&#x27;t so enthusiastic about my intern project (it was an accounting system, so yawn...), and I didn&#x27;t really produce all that much code (it was mainly just gluing some existing systems together). Hell, for a whole week, I was blocked waiting for information from a team in India and spent the entire week working on a side project. However, my team had daily standup, and I always had something to say about what I was doing at the time and what I was stuck on. Perhaps you actually were good about communicating what you were doing and your manager just ascribed to the &quot;time of butt in chair&quot; method of measuring programmer productivity, which is unfortunate. But if you didn&#x27;t, it&#x27;s something to think about.",1386889032

I&#x27;m from the side of the fence that doesn&#x27;t overly care about code tidyness, so long as it performs its overall function. 10 years ago this kind of thing might have bothered me a lot more, but at some point crossed a threshold where I realized _all code generated to the present day_ is pretty ugly and long term unmaintainable (but that&#x27;s a story for a rather large and rather boring essay).<p>The tl;dr is simply that if you obsess over minor details on this level, a lot of brainpower is wasted that could be used for bigger problems you should be much more worried about.<p>Playing devil&#x27;s advocate, in this case the if() is obviously a guard for the subsequent switch. Moving just the constant &#x27;15&#x27; into a #define would make it read more like some magical sentinel value, unless you also #defined all the literal values used in the switch, at which point you&#x27;ve introduced a wholly bullshit layer of abstraction to what was otherwise incredibly concrete and explicit code.<p>Let&#x27;s assume you have a great reason for doing that. OK. So what do you call these constants? Well, the code appears to be branching to special cases based on the width of some integer. So we instead have what, WIDTH_1_BIT, WIDTH_2_BITS, ..., WIDTH_15_BITS? Now we&#x27;ve pulled those constants out, you stare at the block of #defines, and think, damn, this is so <i>ugly</i> since most of the value space isn&#x27;t fully defined! So some kindly maintenance programmer comes along and pads out the rest, producing a perfectly beautiful block of utter line noise.<p>That is arguably considerably less readable than what we started with",1386887742

6897655,comment,6889679,6893692,1,0,lsc,,,">And as someone who uses virtualisation like this extensively: it is about separating functional concerns. I have images of our &quot;standard&quot; web frontends, and our &quot;standard&quot; database backends and their slaves. We can deploy one of those with a few commands to any of our VM hosts (currently using openvz, but looking at both LXC and KVM and combinations). I don&#x27;t want them co-mingled because it complicates migrations as needs change.<p>Once you are at scale, each node, doing one thing, should be able to fill a server,(at scale, you will need a lot more than one server for each service you&#x27;ve got, assuming the app has enough scale to support a team of sysadmins.)  -  the exception I can think of is &#x27;lopsided&#x27; services that require, say, more cpu and less ram than your servers were bought with;  in which case, yeah, if you can find another service that is lopsided in another way, you are in good shape.<p>Until then, sure, you need less than a server, at which point some sort of virtualization makes sense.   (And if you own and sysadmin all apps, containers could make a lot of sense, as they are rather lighter weight.)  And hey, sometimes even if just one app doesn&#x27;t have the scale to support a team of sysadmins, the whole lot of them do.<p>If you are saying that virtualization and containers make a lot of sense for small-scale stuff, or any use case where you need servers that are smaller than the  physical servers you buy,  we are in violent agreement.<p>>E.g. some customers could easily fit on a single server when we start deploying our apps for them, but may a year down the line require a complicated multi-server setup. When they do, and it&#x27;s all in containers, we can migrate the web container to another machine (or duplicate it and load balance), and database container somewhere else, and it&#x27;s all generic tools. We don&#x27;t need to start messing around and untangle dependencies on a single server.<p>This makes it sound like you are as much in the &#x27;service provider&#x27; realm as I am.  That is an interesting way to think of the cluster administrator role;  thinking of the different development groups you are running code for as customers, helping them scale up and down.  I actually don&#x27;t have as much experience with that style of cluster administration.  At all my cluster administration jobs, the products I was sysadmining were already many-server affairs by the time babysitting them became my job.  In those cases, I (and/or the team) pretty much owned the application, with a little bit of help/support from the devs when we couldn&#x27;t figure something out, which is different from the customer/provider setup.<p>>And there&#x27;s the dependency issue. In my experience, I don&#x27;t trust for a second that you will end up with a working setup if you ship packages and install them on a pre-existing OS install. It takes about 5 seconds from someone other than a very experienced sysadmin gets an ssh login to a server before it deviates from the servers it is supposed to be identical to, at which points all bets are off whether or not your app will run once deployed to your production servers at all. VM&#x27;s and containers provide the opportunity to easily guarantee that the images you deploy are unchanged from what you tested on.<p>Sure, sure.... but generally speaking, if you are using whole-server images?  you wipe and re-install the whole goddamn thing every time you get half a chance because of this.  With PXE this isn&#x27;t much more difficult than copying over a new tarball.  Most large clusters have some software that let you burn-in and re-install thousands of servers by typing one or two lines.<p>Now, you can argue that copying a new chroot to a thousand hosts is generally easier, or at least faster to recover from if you screw it up than pxe-installing a thousand hosts, say, if you accidentally target the wrong servers.<p>>Having them neatly isolated in small manageable chunks also means that we are free to change hardware specs, and move containers around depending on what is most cost-effective rather than having to make sure everything fits.<p>Sure, different hardware needs different drivers, but I think the difficulty of dealing with that is overstated.<p>The hard part of having different hardware specs isn&#x27;t the drivers, it&#x27;s the different performance characteristics, and virtualization doesn&#x27;t always help you with that.  You&#x27;ve got some servers with 15K sas disks and others with &#x27;intelipower&#x27;  No amount of virtualization is going to make the two servers perform the same.   But then, sometime Virtualization <i>does</i> help with that, for instance if the problem is ram to cpu (or ram to disk) ratio differences;  if you have one app that requires a lot of ram and disk but little cpu, and another app that requires a lot of cpu and nothing else,  if your new boxes with the best cpu happen to have a lot of ram, you could gain benefit from running them both on the same servers.",1386886454

6897618,comment,6896779,6896779,46,0,skosuri,,,"I looked over the paper pretty quickly, but on a quick read it looks really nice. The data are really impressive, and they seemed to have pulled out really interesting trends for how transcription factors are affecting coding sequence. Furthermore, they map how variants found across the various cell lines they used (81!) to show that these variants actually are causal for transcription factor binding changes. For those saying this is not a big deal, or is obvious; it is, and is not (respectively).<p>It&#x27;s been pretty clear for some time that codon choice is not random (hence codon optimization is useful when taking a gene from one organism to another), and over the last few years it&#x27;s also been clear that codon bias can be evolutionarily constrained. For a while, it mostly thought to be based on tRNA levels (basically anticodons). However, it&#x27;s been increasingly clear that there are other constraints to protein coding sequences than just the decoded protein sequence (aka the genetic code).<p>For example, we published a paper a few weeks back [1] showing that in bacteria (and probably higher organisms), the N-terminus of genes has a lot of rare codons and this is due to other constraints such as relieving mRNA structure to allow better translation of proteins.  I think in the coming years, we will find that other regulatory elements also shape this code, including sequences that control splicing, small RNAs, mRNA degradation and transport, et cetera<p>Anyways, it&#x27;s a pretty fun time in biology. The tools we have now make studies that were ridiculously impossible just a few years ago, a reality for an individual lab. I can&#x27;t wait to see what the next few years bring.<p>[1] <a href=\"http://arep.med.harvard.edu/pdf/Goodman_Sci_13.pdf\\\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://arep.med.harvard.edu/pdf/Goodman_Sci_13.pdf\\</a><p>EDIT: Since my comment has hijacked the most useful comment linking to the original study, I&#x27;ll link to the comment here:<p><a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6897122\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6897122</a>",1386886024

All that shit is customer-hostile privacy-invading bullshit and I&#x27;m ecstatic that Google is making a move that kills it. I vigorously object to things like tracking bugs that leak information about me without my consent, so I&#x27;m in favor of measures like Google&#x27;s that get us further towards people being unable to go on data fishing expeditions such as were possible with inserting arbitrary tracking bugs in emails. HTML email is a giant attack surface not just for Outlook Express-style remote code execution, but for invasions of privacy. If a marketer can&#x27;t do their job without invading my privacy, I have no sympathy for them and I hope that this technical change stabs their business model in the belly.",1386885968

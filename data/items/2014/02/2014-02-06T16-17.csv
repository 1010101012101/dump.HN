7191357,comment,7189978,7189978,3,0,beat,,,"How these objections work depend very strongly on the nature of the startup. It&#x27;s something I&#x27;m very concerned about. My own work is going to be chock full of sensitive customer data about their system configurations (it could be described as a DevOps analytics tool). Privacy and security will be huge concerns for customers. I&#x27;m starting with SaaS, but I fully expect pressure from some customers to provide a COTS version for internal deployment, due to &quot;security&quot;.<p>I don&#x27;t want to do COTS at first because I want the ability to iterate quickly for new features and bug fixing. I can do that with SaaS, but enterprise COTS is the land of programs that haven&#x27;t been updated in <i>years</i>. I don&#x27;t want to put myself in a position of supporting antique versions of the code, even if it comes with lucrative support contracts, because it&#x27;s a drag in other ways. So my answer to customers who can&#x27;t deal with SaaS security in the short run is probably going to be &quot;Sorry&quot;, and my efforts focused on pleasing the customers who are comfortable with a SaaS solution.<p>On the other hand, I&#x27;m not even in beta yet. I may well have to eat those words in fairly short order, if that&#x27;s what it takes for survival and growth a year from now.<p>That all said, I&#x27;ve put a lot of thought into addressing customer objections about their data, and a lot of it is baked right into the architecture.",1391705953
7191356,comment,7190508,7190508,17,0,j_m_b,,,"As a comcast customer, I&#x27;ve noticed that if I am having a problem with streaming video that if I go to speedtest.net, the video streams fine after the initial ping test from speedtest.net. It will be fine for a few moments (seconds to minutes), but will slow down or stutter again eventually. A fresh visit to speedtest.net again corrects the problem.  I have a hunch that a visit to speedtest.net will disable traffic shaping for a set period of time in order to convince people that their connection is fine.<p>It is interesting that in the article about Verizon&#x27;s shaping of traffic to AWS that the tech support had the author go to speedtest.net and test his traffic in order to tell him &quot;see no problems!&quot;. I&#x27;ve had similar responses from AT&T when I was a DSL subscriber.<p>I understand that traffic shaping should only affect particular sites and that,in theory,there would be no need for a temporary disabling of traffic shaping for a speedtest. My theory is that due to the high volume of packets needed in order to have a good result on speedtest.net, the analyses of packets at the router for traffic shaping is enough of a slowdown to affect the results.<p>Anyone else ever notice this?\nAny alternative explanations as to why going to speedtest.net would suddenly make paused streaming video run again? I notice this mainly when watching live streaming youtube events or sometimes when I am watching netflix during peak hours.<p>I would love to hear alternative hypothesis as to what is going so that they could be tested!",1391705947

No.  Was I being offensive?  Probably.  Am I now more sensitive about it?

I takes a lot of dedication to reach the point where you&#x27;re comfortable with the terminal and see it&#x27;s potential. I don&#x27;t think students would reach that point in school.<p>> I&#x27;ve always felt the opposite is true, that most Windows based solutions enable people to do easy things easier than with Linux, but that implementing more complex solutions often quickly becomes harder on the Windows platform than on Linux. That&#x27;s been my experience, YMMV.<p>It is from a technical point of view but for the average person who will never need to do anything more complex it isn&#x27;t. And even if they do need something more complex they&#x27;re already invested into windows so it&#x27;s unlikely they&#x27;ll switch.

This recently changed and now I quite enjoy C++. Destructors are one reason why. The whole idea of resource-managing classes and RAII is clever and really useful.<p>The hard part is that it takes a lot to be a good C++ programmer. C is such a smaller language, you can master a handful of best practices, gain experience, and become a competent C programmer. In contrast, C++ is such a large language you have to be active in learning everything â€”Â read Meyers, Modern C++, GoF&#x27;s Design Patterns, etc. Anything short of this, and you&#x27;re going to accidentally reinvent the wheel or do something stupid.

It defeats the purpose of citing sources, of course, if Wikipedia &quot;bootstraps&quot; its own sources by citing print-outs of previous versions of Wikipedia articles as the source.<p>This does leave a more subtle problem than literal printouts of Wikipedia articles, which is harder to solve. Sometimes journalists and even scholars consult a Wikipedia article for background, and then just repeat something similar uncritically, without independently verifying whether the Wikipedia article is correct. If the Wikipedia article then at some point ends up citing that writing as a source, a hidden reference-loop is created, with Wikipedia effectively &quot;laundering&quot; a self-reference (unintentionally) through a third party repeating something they read on Wikipedia.

It probably doesn&#x27;t have it in stock, but it knows where it can buy it for, say, $9, drop-ship it to the customer without ever seeing the acutal product, and make a buck on the arbitrage. Robot 2 notices this and lists the same book for $11, hoping to do the same thing. Robot 1 notices Robot 2&#x27;s listing, doesn&#x27;t know or care that Robot 2 is another arbitrage trader, and reprices its listing for the book to $12. Robot 2 notices this and goes to $13, and away we go.<p>This makes no sense; the fundamental rule of amazon bots is that consumers buying used books almost always buy the <i>lowest-priced</i> used book available. So the bot war would send the price <i>down</i>, not up.<p>Why in the world would bot 2 offer the book for $11? It would know that nobody would buy it when there was one already listed for $10.<p>The silly-high-priced books that I saw when I was working for the book company were rare long-tail books. One of the discoveries that many people have made is that for rare books, whether or not you understand what the heck it is, some % of them will get bought even if they&#x27;re listed for <i>silly</i> high prices. Enough people will pay thousands of dollars (not an exaggeration) for a used copy of a book that they can&#x27;t find elsewhere that stocking the long tail of books can in fact be very valuable.<p>That means that, when you find lots of rare books, your incentive is to throw out some crazy-high price for each, because some % of them will, in fact, get paid, making the whole enterprise worthwhile.<p>edit: Arbitrage on the same market Does Not Work, in my experience, and to just claim that it does with no evidence doesn&#x27;t make it any more likely to do so.",1391705145

However, the ones putting the transactions in the chain, are not XCP miners. They&#x27;re bitcoin miners, they don&#x27;t care what extra information you attach. And by extension, they don&#x27;t care if they violate some rule in your protocol.<p>This basically means that XCP-looking transactions will appear in the blockchain, however, they will be invalid, because by the rules of XCP their outputs would already be spent.<p>In Bitcoin this is an invalid transaction, and it never enters the public ledger. This important because, it allows you to shortcut the path to figure out if an address has unspent outputs. Figuring out quickly if an address has unspent outputs or not is important for miners (they need to produce valid blocks), and it&#x27;s important for participants to transactions, because it means the recepient can quickly verify that the sender is intending to make the transaction, and that a transaction, sufficiently confirmed, is not double spent. The recepient relies on the work of everybody who produced a block. And in turn, everybody who produces a block relies on the work of everybody before AND on the work of everybody after (who bases their block on his).<p>This is what I mean by iron-clad guarantee against a double spend.<p>But if nobody can reject an invalid TX for XCP, that means verifying that something has unspent outputs is an extremely expensive task. And the longer transactions go on, the more expensive this task becomes. And nobody can put in some kind of &quot;block&quot; that could be rejected by others to &quot;proove&quot; that some balances on addresses are now valid up to that point.<p>This means that in a short time, XCP will become unusable for everybody as the XCP-TX spam rises and everybody is checking the entire bitcoin blockchain over and over and over for XCP-looking TXes to figure out if the coin he thinks he got, aren&#x27;t actually double spends.",1391705020

Find a candy that has a long shelf life, and during your normal packing process, pack and set aside shipments to be used as &#x27;Welcome Bags&#x27;. Then, all you need to do when a new customer signs up is label and ship them. Even doing this once per week on your non-shipping weeks would significantly improve the average purchase-to-candy delay. Then, to avoid shipping them 3 packs in one month, you can just omit them from the very next ship list. What you&#x27;re effectively doing is splitting the purchase delay into two chunks instead of one long one. This also means people&#x27;s experience will improve over the first two months - they&#x27;ll be getting candy more and more frequently for the first 3 - 4 shipments.",1391704851

If your skill in anything were dependent on how good your teachers were at the skill itself, rather than at the skill of teaching, then we would <i>really</i> be a lost society.<p>I don&#x27;t think I had a single teacher in high school or a professor in college that was a better programmer than me, and half of my professors probably couldn&#x27;t code beyond the old linked list example they were putting up on the projector every semester. They didn&#x27;t teach me how to program. They taught me how to reason about software.<p>But that isn&#x27;t the point. As far as I&#x27;m concerned, the act of programming is unteachable. The physical act of typing characters in a text editor, running tests on it, and changing some characters with new characters, is all you can teach, but the mental leaps of figuring out which are the right characters and tests and changes for the failing tests takes a lifetime of experience and practice.<p>But that doesn&#x27;t mean there isn&#x27;t a role that a teacher can play to instruct students during that personal experience. Otherwise, what is the point of art teachers? It&#x27;s the same thing, you can&#x27;t really teach someone to make good art. You can teach them the mechanics of holding a brush and putting paint on a canvas, or taking photos, or writing. I&#x27;ve seen dozens of kids spend small fortunes on art educations at Ivy League schools and they still aren&#x27;t artists. Because you can&#x27;t teach them how to make something have meaning.<p>And I knew dozens of kids in my own computer science program who spent the equivalent of a luxury car on a software development education and they still aren&#x27;t software developers. Few of us stayed in the field, post-graduation, and fewer still are any good at it.<p>The only problem I can foresee with the &quot;Learn To Code&quot; movement is not &quot;not everyone can learn to code.&quot; It&#x27;s that, having the ability to write text in a text editor and run a compiler against it, is going to give everyone opinions on what <i>software development</i> should be, but they will have no experience, no knowledge of what distinguishes software development from programming. I can see it reinforcing the asshole manager view &quot;it&#x27;s just pushing buttons on a keyboard, what is so hard?&quot; Because &quot;pushing buttons on a keyboard&quot; is all they are going to teach.<p>It would be as if we replaced our art classes with paint-by-number sessions.<p>But, on the other hand, we do force people through art museums and art appreciation classes and they don&#x27;t seem to try to tell artists what creating art should be.

7191160,comment,7186491,7188056,3,0,jarrett,,,"> The part that I don&#x27;t understand is why the programmer even has to acknowledge the subpoena at all or show up to court.<p>That&#x27;s actually the whole point of subpoenas. They&#x27;re a step up from a simple letter demanding information. In the latter case, the recipient may choose to respond in the hopes of placating the sender, or s/he may choose to ignore it. You can see why that would be a problem. Sometimes litigants genuinely <i>need</i> to force the other party to produce information. There has to be some method of doing so, and there has to be some way to enforce compliance. Thus the subpoena: A request you&#x27;re not allowed to simply ignore.<p>Obviously, if you create a procedural right like this, there&#x27;s room for abuse. The courts theoretically serve as a check on such abuse. The court may reject a litigant&#x27;s application for a subpoena outright. Alternatively, the recipient may file a motion to quash, explaining to the court why s/he shouldn&#x27;t have to comply with the subpoena. Subpoenas that are abusive, oppressive, overly burdensome, unreasonable, or downright outrageous will likely be quashed.<p>Even with these checks in place, the system is imperfect. Recipients of defective subpoenas are still burdened with, at the very least, filing a motion to quash. Practically speaking, anyone who receives a subpoena will have to pay for a lawyer or find one to represent him/her for free.<p>This problem is not unique to subpoenas. The same argument could be made about nearly any legal process. If I sue you frivolously, you still have to get a lawyer. If the state arrests you for no reason, you still have to get a lawyer. Et cetera. Is there a solution? There may be a partial solution available to our society: We could increase the penalties for abuse of legal process, and make those penalties applicable in a broader range of circumstances. Of course, this approach increases the risk to those who would make legitimate use of legal processes, so it&#x27;s not without downsides. It&#x27;s a difficult balance to strike.",1391704184

With the same amount of money that&#x27;s currently being sucked into their manned program, infinitely more and better scientific endeavors can be funded. Imagine not only having a mars rover, but an entire robotic base on mars that could possibly fuel itself and send out dozens of missions with air-and-land-based drones. Or perhaps the same on Venus or Titan, or even better equipment for monitoring Earth.  Far-fetched, sure, but with the kind of budget the manned program is pulling in, I believe things like that are possible.<p>With that said, I&#x27;m OK with us still having a space station with people in it, because it keeps the engines of the national space machine greased. It won&#x27;t be long before the United States is faced with a new contender for Global Superpower, and space will definitely become the place to be. If you want to control the land, you must control the sea, and if you want to control the sea, you must control space. As our military becomes more and more drone-heavy, I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if Space Command drastically increases its scope and reach as an organization. Its much faster to control a drone across the world in real time from space than it is from Virginia.<p>Couple military need with the new blood of private contractors (spaceX and its like), I believe space will be a big deal once again in a few decades.",1391703527

Stanza is good but was bought by Amazon and (again, from what I saw) nothing was done with it.<p>Prime Video is great on iOS but has a very very odd lack of presence on Android, despite being available on the Kindle Fire.<p>Kindle HD/HDX devices are unable to install apps from the Google Play store without rooting or other technical workarounds.<p>My point with these is that there appears to be a history of Amazon acting in favor of their own platforms and applying a strategy that encourages users to &quot;buy in&quot; to more Amazon.<p>Amazon&#x27;s video game digital delivery service has proven to be price-competitive with Steam, but downloading games directly from Amazon is a bare-bones affair.<p>If Amazon wants to own more of the living room I&#x27;m guessing that:<p>- They will want to get out of the business of being a Steam key reseller if they have their own console<p>- Seeing as they&#x27;ve acquired a game developer it&#x27;s plausible they produce content that is available only in the Amazon app store and not Google play.  Over time this may become Amazon-console exclusive as well.<p>- Prime Video will continue to be offered on other platforms but will get less attention over time in favor of adding features to a Amazon-console version of Prime Video (I am honestly surprised that the iOS version is so good)<p>As far as pricing and ads, I would expect to see a dashboard with heavy tie ins to Prime Video and Amazon&#x27;s App Store.

I am familiar with PHP (Symfony Framework),JS, Handling Servers: VPS,AWS, etc and have a dream product idea but the only thing that is making me not to quit this job and &#x27;start up&#x27; is the fear of failure.<p>My fears are primarily due to :<p>1 )  My dream product is having a bunch of big competitions and is targeted towards  developers/Project managers (Ex: Basecamp/Atlassian/IBM Rational Suites etc).Even though I am okay when it comes to development, I cant sell especially not in these kind of targeted developers group :(<p>2 ) I have never worked in a complex Symfony PHP Application which I have to work on if i pursue my product idea.<p>3 ) Even though I have friends in real life but when it comes to my Startup idea , I am all alone.  I have read and seen repeatedly that a sole founder startup is doomed in most of the cases.<p>4 ) Going back to my job is very difficult if I fail as we have large number of aspirants for the job and a break in career is a black mark in my country.<p>But Money is not much of a issue as i have saved chunk of my salary. So i can Survive for next 1-2 years.<p>Continued in comment below ..https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7190984",1391702400

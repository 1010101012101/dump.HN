If you're like me, you don't want nsfw sites in your browsing history and especially not in your bookmarks. So I built http://xstashed.com/hn/ (clickable in comments) - a place to stash your nsfw links.<p>While it's a minimal viable product, I do have a basic roadmap that can be viewed here http://xstashed.com/todo/. I just wanted to get this in the hands of potential users to get feedback early on.<p>On the tech side of things I've built this thing nimble so that I can quickly shape the site from your feedback. For those who are interested in the technical site of xstashed, it's a custom Django (Python) application continuously deployed with Chef. MySQL for database, Celery for background task, and Redis for cache and Celery broker.",1359338365

5126664,comment,5126017,5126384,3,0,jerf,,,"""Anything worth trying once for, is worth trying twice for.""<p>I can give you a far more specific principle. The only solution a government bureaucrat knows for when the first thing they tried didn't work is do the same thing, only harder.<p>The logic is simple: Any other proposed second solution by the bureaucrat is <i>ipso facto</i> proof that their first idea was bad and wrong. Therefore, this is not an acceptable proposal, since it implies they should be removed from office or should have less power. Clearly, the problem will not be solved by doing <i>less</i>, and it wasn't solved by doing the amount we tried the first time, so therefore, the only thing we can propose is to do the same thing, but harder.<p>War on drugs? Education reform? Significant swathes of foreign policy? This pattern is everywhere in government, and companies large and secure enough to be dominated by politics rather than market realities.

At NetMarket, we were proud of ourselves for figuring out after a few days that we couldn't put the state of the shopping cart items in the URL, since you lost it with the back button, and so we needed to use a state ID in the URL as a key to the database.

5126645,comment,5124929,5125144,9,0,Yttrill,,,"This does reflect very sadly on schools, and shows up when trying to explain things to programmers used to conventional languages, especially if you're trying to explain why C is fundamentally broken.<p>Roughly there are three fundamental control transfer operations: conditional jumps, subroutine calls, and coroutine calls. A subroutine is a slave, the caller is a master. With coroutines, the caller and callee are peers.<p>Coroutine calling is more fundamental and easier to program, but it isn't available in C.<p>The theory is about continuations. A continuation is just ""the rest of the program"". You can think of it as the program counter (PC). Subroutine calling works by passing a continuation to a routine, when the routine is finished it invokes the continuation. This is done by pushing the program counter on the stack, and the subroutine popping it with a return statement.<p>Coroutines work by exchange of control. When you call a coroutine you give it your current continuation to call when its ready. But also you do not call the coroutine at the beginning. You call it where it last left off: at its last continuation point.<p>A set of coroutines are usually called fibres. They represent interleaving of control. You can emulate them with pre-emptive threads and locks, but coroutines are synchronous and non-premptive.<p>Felix and Go both make heavy use of coroutines (called fthreads and goroutines). Iterators as in Python are a special case.<p>In general on today's badly designed CPU's you have to think of coroutines as requiring stack swapping. Threads do this which is why you can emulate coroutines with threads.<p>By far the most well known coroutine scheduler is .. the Operating System. Its basically a coroutine of applications. This is why you can read and write to files: the real world is event driven but callbacks are impossible to program with. So the operating control inverts the events by stack swapping so your application can be written as a master.<p>You think you're calling the OS, and the OS thinks its calling you.  You're both masters. That's coroutines.<p>Python (and Felix) both have yield, but that's a special case. In general the model is reading and writing channels: yielding is just writing the ""sole"" channel and getting a function result is just reading it. A channel is basically a ""place to swap stacks"".",1359337999

On the other hand, a more conservative idea might be to try to record the entire state of the environment when particular samples are recorded, so that in theory you could replay all that analysis- fire up the vm from 2 years ago, install the same version of all the packages, install the code with the same tags, and analysis that data set, then do the same thing for every other data set.

As the author notes, even if the ramblings of the stalker are so obviously crazy, it still requires people to evaluate whether you could have done said actions and whether it is a risk to associate with you regardless.<p>My wife got dragged into a situation a while ago. She merely commented on a blog article about a man who had travelled to another country, got a woman pregnant, and then when the woman got sick and needed treatment, claimed it was a scam. In his mind it grew into a giant conspiracy. Anyone who didn't take his side was involved in this conspiracy, including the hospital, local business people, even the British Embassy was in on it apparently. And then my wife, for commenting on an article. I worked out that if you divided the hospital bill by the number of people he alleged were involved, they'd all make about $3 each.<p>The local community rallied behind the woman who was disadvantaged and could barely afford the bill. They tracked her down, obtained proof from the hospital, took photos and posted them (with permission) thinking that would clear up the allegations. He started to look for evidence in every blog post, image, comment and forum posting. Where you look for a pattern, given enough data, you start to find them. He tweaked his conspiracy theory to fit the patterns he found, offering them up as evidence. My wife's name ended up on a ""website of scammers"" he created. He set up free websites on many services, created videos which he cross posted to every video sharing site (surprisingly effective), set up blogs dedicated to his ramblings.<p>Eventually the community he was targeting with his hate had enough. Being computer literate they beat him at his own game, set up a domain that matched his real name, used masses of SEO and inbound links from networks of blogs they ran, and listed what he'd done on the website. Now whenever someone Googles his name or something related, they can see exactly what he's done. Since he worked as a freelance professional with schools, theatres and companies, this really was not good for him, and after that he seemed to vanish. I presume this was only effective because his own reputation could be used as leverage. If they have nothing to lose it would be a pretty bad situation, as the author has experienced.<p>I have another anecdote about a friend who tried to raise money in his community for victims of a disaster, only to be character assassinated by a fake facebook account.

5126512,comment,5125939,5125939,4,0,cageface,,,"I think this article highlights a legitimate weakness in Apple's one size fits all product line. Smart phones are as much luxury fashion accessory as communication tool now. Like other luxury fashion items people believe they're making some kind of statement about themselves by choosing one product over another. And there's not really that much you can say about yourself by choosing the same single iPhone model that Apple sells to everybody else.<p>I really think this year is going to be pivotal for Apple. They can recover their momentum if they broaden their product line and demonstrate some vision in UI. If they continue to stubbornly cling to the tactics that brought them their recent successes they're going to continue to slide. They are, to some extent, a victim of their own success. Android 2.x was so rough that Google didn't stand to lose much in a bold redesign and they leapfrogged iOS with ICS. Apple has a huge userbase used to iOS as it looks and works today and they risk alienating them if they make the changes they need to make to stay relevant for another product generation.<p>As much as I criticize some of their decisions I hope they do show some new life because iOS is currently the only mobile platform that enables the kind of real-time multimedia apps I want to write.",1359335288

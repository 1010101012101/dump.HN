While there is competition obviously, many start ups are actually complements for other companies.  It is entirely possible that many of the start ups ""competing"" with each other actually thrive on the success of others and  even increase the success of other companies through their existence.<p>As an example, think about a company like Heroku, and Amazon.  Heroku makes using AWS easier, so Amazon rents more time and servers to Heroku while Heroku also makes money that otherwise wouldn't have been made.

I started looking on Monday and accepted a job by Wednesday afternoon.<p>If you are interested in working with a recruiter let me know and I can put you in touch with the person that helped me.  I won't name drop but if you would like me to put you in touch I will be more than happy to.<p>Questions:
- What technology stack(s) are you comfortable with?
- What type of development are you interested in the most?<p>Suggestions:
- Do not just take a job for the sake of moving out here. A means to an end is simply not enough in the bay.  You need a life too and that costs $$.  Make sure you take a job that will fulfill you financially and professionally. (I moved out here 2 years ago).<p>- Get in touch with a recruiting agency about 1 week before you arrive.  They will fill up your schedule with interviews.<p>- Stay anywhere you can that is cheap and near Caltrain.  You'll probably have to travel all over the peninsula for interviews so a central location does not apply.<p>- Check Meetup.com and other user groups of interest (if you are into Node, find the node user group meeting in the bay and be there).  Fill your evenings with networking events so you can meet people.  Once people hear your story they will take a vested interest in your success and they will <i>help</i> you find interviews and network.  This I cannot stress enough.  Use your personality and make people want you to move out here.  A lot of people are transplants and will go out of the way to help a fellow transplant out.<p>Other than that - good luck.  I think 1 week is enough for preliminary interviews but I would plan for 2 weeks if you can.  With 2 weeks I am confident you will find an offer.<p>Regards",1334883204

Obviously it's true that ""outsider"" startups will see their funding dry up faster than YC companies and other ""insider"" groups will.  But I don't think that's the right metric.

GroupOn is a much better indication that a bunch of non-technical people are eager to buy overvalued tech stocks.<p>Of course we are in a bubble.  Not in the real estate bubble sense, mind you, but in the 1999 tech bubble sense.  Tech and health care are the two industries actually growing.<p>Right now no one knows which companies are really creating value and which are just hype.  The last bubble created more value than money was invested, but the investors don't discriminate well between valuable companies and those that are just taking them for a ride.  That doesn't mean that all the companies are overvalued, just that some of them are.<p>Plenty of companies emerged successfully from the last bubble.  Plenty of companies will come out of this one by creating actual value.

We have seen various internet businesses take share from magazines, cable broadcasters, billboards which has led to unsustainable growth which will end soon.  When it ends people will realize projecting 30%+ growth for website ad revenue is dumb and will lead to massive losses.<p>The ""we are not in a bubble"" argument should be:  Internet advertising is taking share from other sources and will continue to do so for a long time.  Because online advertising allows you to buy products right away or customize ads to individuals, its more efficient.  That efficiency makes advertising spending more likely to increase as a percentage of costs for businesses.  A combination of those will help fuel continued growth in startups.<p>Regardless of which you believe or a hybrid version, at some point internet advertising will reach its max and there will be a bubble followed by a crash.

iTunes gives me an alert saying some tracks can not be synced and so the sync process hangs until I close the prompt or manually stop the sync on my iPhone. 
If I remove a large app on my phone (example: the 1Gb Max Payne game) and then attempt to sync the phone after, iTunes decides to install the app again which means a lengthy transfer of a 1Gb file.

Taking this logic to its conclusion, in a fair and just society, if a law enforcement agency executes a search warrant, it should have to pay those affected by the search warrant the reasonable costs of that seizure (e.g. the cost of renting and deploying an acceptable alternative until the equipment is returned, or the cost of lost business if it is a purely for-profit organisation and loss acceptance appears to be the cheaper based on the information available to the business at the time). This wouldn't apply if the court was satisfied following a contested hearing that the person having assets seized was a party to a crime being investigated.<p>While the above would be fair, it is not how the law works in many jurisdictions, because politics works on what politicians can fit in a sound bite (lower taxes! more law enforcement on the same budget!), not necessarily what is fair to minorities like innocent parties having their equipment seized.",1334880599

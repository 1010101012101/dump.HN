Your desire to reduce this to black and white statements tells me you're only interested in convincing yourself you're right. \n""private telephone companies (dial up) would never have bothered wiring huge swaths of this country where houses or farms are miles apart."" It's not too hard to deduce from my statement that private telephone companies would have wired parts of the country where homes were very close together and they could therefore reasonably price their services and capture a profit. And roads would be built to the most populous towns and cities where there would be enough traffic to create tolls low enough that people would adopt the roads.<p>Again, government investment in infrastructure makes a lot of sense, and happens, when the economics do not make sense for a private company.",1368989979

Rather, I am providing you with a list of timestamps in ISO 8601 format. I am making no claims about how Satoshi tends to write timestamps (and I don't remember if I even looked at that, I think I got bored).<p>These timestamps can be used to determine which timezone he is a member of, or which timezone he wanted you to think he was a member of, or to compare against other email headers. For example, I would love to compare this data against a historically-accurate cypherpunk email archive. (I do not have one at the moment.)<p>However, he could have written some small amount of software to delay the posts he wrote to the forum, but some of them look very timely. He could also have written software to delay the times that his posts were posted, to make it sync up with the timestamps of another cypherpunk member (which would be hilarious and evil).<p>I think a more thorough analysis would have to look at each individual Satoshi forum post and determine whether or not it was written ""probably delayed"", because sometimes the delta between the post he wrote and the post he was replying to was very tiny, which would improve the chances that he was not on a delay timer (unless he spoofed all questions he replied to, which I also doubt).",1368988614

Let me share 2 comments: 1) i only tried icomoon, and 2) i used only 1 embedded font.<p>I use jqMobi, now called Intel App Framework, to build a mobile website that targets all major mobile browsers. The jqMobi framework includes ~70 icons from icomoon embedded into its ui CSS. I needed a few more, so I initially tried to extend that by making another font file called icomoon-extra, uploading it to <a href=""http://www.motobit.com/util/base64-decoder-encoder.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.motobit.com/util/base64-decoder-encoder.asp</a> to produce the base64 string and adding another @font-face to the jqMobi CSS. That didn't work for me, so i simply created a new icomoon-ac file that includes most of the original icons from the jqMobi icomoon selection, plus another ~30 or so icons that i needed. Now, i just use my icomoon-ac font in the framework and it works.<p>Regarding jqMobi, I absolutely love this framework. Much like the author of the original article, i looked at a bunch of frameworks. jQuery Mobile was my initial ""no brainer"" choice but it quickly lost favor with me because it was very difficult to customize. They really screwed it up, IMO. I looked at wink, joApp, dhtmlx, unify, uranium, embedjs, enyo, lungo, the-m-project, mobl, barleyjs, limejs, joshfire, lavaca, xui, zepto, chocolatechip, jQT, iUI.

I know my learning style. It's depth first. I'm bookish.<p>So, I'm developing an outline - a sketch of what Emacs actually is. To me it looks like AutoCad of 1991 with a less powerful graphic interface - AutoCad had screen menus which were a context sensitive text based menu system. The difference between that and the <handfull> of Emacs extensions I have seen is that AutoCad screen menus were persistent and had a dedicated slice of the ""window"" (right or left side). They paged and predated pull downs in the interface.[1]<p>Anyway, the picture that is coming into focus is that what tutorials are teaching is not the language of Emacs (commands and eLisp), but the language of Emacs users (shortcuts).<p>Beyond that, Emacs command language uses a verb-noun structure. This is both a natural product of its Lispy origin and lousy for users.<p>[The following examples are fictitious]<p>Lisp thinking tends toward being about processes not objects. A programmer will create a higher order procedure <make f> contracted<p><pre><code>  procedure -> procedure. \n</code></pre>\nCall <make buffer> and get <make-buffer>. Call <next line> get <next-line>, call <previous line> get previous-line. It's all nice and tidy from a programmer perspective.<p>It sucks for the user. The user needs a buffer. Is it <create-buffer>, <new-buffer>, <add-buffer>, or <make-buffer>?<p>Auto completion doesn't help. The user cannot easily conjure the proper demon. This is where object oriented conventions rule the field. If the user knows the kind of spirit, they know the first half of the spell, [2] and auto-completion is much easier. <buffer.next> <buffer.new> are more user friendly.<p>Just because from the perspective of the code <next-buffer> may be more akin to <next-line> than it is to <previous-buffer>, it is not akin semantically. There may be a natural language which uses prefix notation, but even if there is, few computer users speak it natively. When Emacs was a tool for a small community familiar with Lisp, verb-noun probably was not an impediment to learning its intricacies. Now it may be something a full fledged tutorial needs to be cognizant of.<p>[1] <a href=""http://docs.autodesk.com/ACD/2010/ENU/AutoCAD%202010%20User%20Documentation/index.html?url=WS73099cc142f4875513fb5cd10c4aa30d6b-7bf8.htm,topicNumber=d0e389142"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.autodesk.com/ACD/2010/ENU/AutoCAD%202010%20User%...</a><p>[2] Ableson and Sussman rock.",1368987429

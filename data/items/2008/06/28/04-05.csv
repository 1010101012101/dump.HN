It also matches no string, I guess to mean 0.<p>Next part matches a captured string consisting of 2 or more ones, and the captured string must be repeated at least one time. That is, 2+ repetitions of chunks of 2+ ones.<p>This much is obvious, but it wasn't until I wrote it out that I realized what it is doing:<p>multiples of 2<p>11+11 or 11+11+11 or 11+11+11+11 or ...  = 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, ...<p>multiples of 3<p>111+111 or 111+111+111 or 111+111+111+111 or ... = 6, 9, 12, ...<p>multiples of 4<p>1111+1111 or 1111+1111+1111 or ... = 8, 12, 16, 20, ...<p>multiples of 5<p>11111+11111 or 11111+11111+11111 or ... = 10, 15, 20, 25, ...<p>multiples of n<p>which leaves only primes remaining.<p>Side note:\nIn Perl, executing it this way:<p>$nstr = 1 x $ARGV[0];\nprint ($nstr =~ m/^1?$|^(11+?)\1+$/ ? ""composite\n"" : ""prime\n"");<p>The largest prime I can find without a seg fault is 37397<p>And the largest composite I can find without a seg fault is 37399",1214628773

If it doesn't then it's not.<p>All this nonsense about whether it's wierd or whether it somehow relates to hookers is just a total waste of time.<p>It's just a frameword guys.

Think about that next time someone talks about the minor cost of slightly dampening economic growth. The third world would certainly be better off with climate change and twice the wealth than slightly delayed climate change and the same level of wealth.<p>Either way, the solution to this and any problem is engineering.

I suppose for some it's a matter of degrees -- determination doesn't imply being an asshole, but sometimes really pushing yourself can lead you to take energy from the things you'd be doing to make the people around you happy and divert that energy into your own work. That is, you don't become cold so much as you sacrifice a bit of warmth.",1214626923

It's priced so low that I would consider buying it myself, personally, if I thought it would make me better at my job but my employer wouldn't fork out for it. That's an aggressive price point.<p>Secondly, there's nothing wrong with getting paid for your hard work. If people don't want to pay, and other people want to give advice for free, that can and will still happen - the two models can coexist, they aren't mutually exclusive. I think some geeks are a little wary of paid products and would do well to try selling something they make that has value for users.",1348876590

Verizon was originally planning to launch the Pre as its premiere smartphone but then got in bed with Google, launched the Droid, and the rest is history.  I don't think WebOS would be in Android's position if things had gone differently; the ability to customize Android was always its biggest selling factor... but maybe, just maybe, Verizon customers would have loved their WebOS phones enough to give it a longer life than it had. It was a much better OS than Android at the time. As someone who owned Android 1.0, 1.5, and 1.6 devices I can definitely say that.",1348876120

However, I've since moved to Clojure, which I would recommend over CL. The main reason is that you can do more with Clojure. The packaging system is a lot easier to deal with, and you have a lot more at your disposal through your access to Java libraries. Another good reason is that Clojure is just more pleasant to deal with than CL. For example, there are many CL implementations and dealing with their differences is a pain in the ass.

There is going to be a huge Bootstrap ecosystem - again similar to WordPress as well as jQuery.

4588219,comment,4587382,4587382,1,0,xackpot,,,"You know what, my standard answer would be: ""Go take a degree if you want to cross the screening barrier at companies for a job. This is what companies usually do to avoid spending time looking for individuals who don't have a degree but are awesome"".
But over a round of beers at a nice pub I would say is that the education system is highly overrated. If everybody started looking for talent of an individual, leaving aside the educational certificates they hold, we would have society working at its full potential. 
 In my opinion, the aim should be learning, not getting a degree. Also to get higher up, you don't need a degree. Just because one has a degree doesn't mean one is capable of executing the task assigned to. Suppose, you get a degree and grab a job, but you fail to deliver. Are you still gonna get higher up? Now say, you get in without a degree, but really churn out a stellar performance at work. Is anybody going to stop you from climbing up? What is the difference between the two scenarios? One is of course the degree and the other one is the quality of work you are putting in. 
  I really didn't give you an answer as you might have subconsciously made a decision but I hope I have propelled you to think more and take a right direction.",1348873305

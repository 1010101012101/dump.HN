It's 3.25 miles and I do it in about 16-18 minutes (exact minutes matter when you're catching a train).  The train ride gives me a chance to air out before work, so the summer weather hasn't been too bad.  Chicago winter should be fun :).",1218124431

Supposedly, their developers work very closely with you, if necessary, in order to get the most out of the product. To the point of helping you write code in your own app. It's not so bad having a team of experts at your disposal when you're trying to scale your startup app that suddenly became popular overnight. I think the licensing terms are negotiated on a case by case basis too so the royalties thing may not be set in stone.<p>It's certainly understandable why people would be turned off by their license, but it's not necessarily a bad deal. It also says a lot that Franz has been in business as long as they have with this type of license. The customers who have signed on must be getting something worthwhile out of it.",1218123449

269685,comment,268710,269067,0,0,lliiffee,,,"I think you are on to something.  For example, many people see research in the sciences as the progress of a few unbelievable geniuses, with 99% of people contributing nothing and wasting their time.  So, for example, progress in Physics is just waiting for the next Einstein to show up to make the next insanely brilliant advance.<p>However, I think that is wrong.  Einstein was obviously a huge genius, but with an IQ of 160, I calculate there are currently about 9 million (=3 billion * .003) people walking the earth with higher ones.  The stars have to be properly aligned so that it is <i>possible</i> to make such an advance.  It is no coincidence that Einstein's discoveries were made so soon after other physicists make the contributions necessary for them.  If he hadn't done it, it would have been somebody else.",1218122871

All iPhone apps will be free just like all software will one day be free. Anyone who believes that is just not aware of capitalism and psychology. People will want to make money off their applications, and people will want to pay money for applications. People making money have more incentive and capital to make a better program than someone giving away something for free. Sure, there will be exceptions, but it doesn't mean your iPhone app will be forced out the market any time soon by a free alternative.",1218122732

So my assumption would have to be that he actually thought this was true for some reason. Possible reasons:<p>1. He misheard something or otherwise confused OS/2 with something else. DB/2 for example.\n2. IBM had extracted some bit of technology derived from the OS/2 lineage and were pitching this as the latest and greatest thing.<p>On this assumption, flat out contradicting him would make him look stupid, and at least be a little rude. So to me this says more about his character (VC who plays games - sounds unpleasant) than it does about that of the people he says it to, other than that they're prepared to dissemble a little to keep an investor happy.<p>Me, I'd say ""Really?

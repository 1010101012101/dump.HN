It exhibits many of the same problems as Slashdot, but they&#x27;re usually worse at SN than at Slashdot.<p>While many of the stories are the same at both sites, they&#x27;re typically on Slashdot well before they&#x27;re on SN. Many low-quality submissions get through on SN, as well, most of which would have no chance at Slashdot. Of these low-quality submissions at SN, many of them come from a small number of frequent contributors who are known to consistently send in biased and inflammatory submissions. While Slashdot&#x27;s editors aren&#x27;t known for doing a good job, we aren&#x27;t seeing anything better out of SN&#x27;s editors, and in fact I&#x27;d say they&#x27;re doing a worse job based on some of the submissions I&#x27;ve seen there that have made it to the SN front page.<p>The SN community is also quite tiny. Most of the comments I&#x27;ve seen come from a relatively small number of people. Slashdot still offers a much larger community. This results in much better discussion at Slashdot, while much of the discussion at SN is inane, if not totally off topic.<p>Slashdot&#x27;s moderation system isn&#x27;t great, but I do find it generally does help me identify high quality comments, while also helping me to disregard low quality comments. That&#x27;s not the case at SN. When I read the comments at SN, I always have to set it to show -1 comments. Very insightful and informative comments often end up at -1 on SN, while many of the highly-rated comments are absolutely worthless. The very small number of active users results in an even smaller number of users who are allowed to moderate, and this has resulted in the moderation system being used to push specific agendas or target certain other users, rather than giving a quasi-objective rating of a comment&#x27;s value. The moderation system at Slashdot is generally helpful. The moderation system at SN is used as a weapon.<p>SN had a lot of potential. But now that the Slashdot beta site is gone, and likely won&#x27;t be back, the biggest benefit of SN is gone. With its lack of quality submissions, with its small community, with its moderation problems, and with it&#x27;s other less-serious flaws, SN provides no benefit over Slashdot. Slashdot offers better stories faster, its community offers wider and deeper points of view, its moderation system is much fairer and more balanced, and it&#x27;s just a much better news source than SN is.",1433112829

9635911,comment,9635133,9635278,0,0,akg_67,,,"> when people talk about fixed income, they refer to the low risk government one<p>I am sorry to say this is incorrect. No knowledgeable person will refer fixed income as &quot;low risk government one&quot;. Fixed Income covers a broad range of assets that are typically debt-based, non-equity based that generate periodic payments/interest. This includes Government Bonds, Corporate Bonds, and other debt securities (Real Estate, Consumer Loans, Invoice Financing, come to my mind). Fixed income is a very large and complex (much more than equities) field and calling it as just &quot;low risk government one&quot; is a disservice to the field.<p>> According to Markowitz, you buy fixed income as &quot;risk free&quot; asset, to offset an optimal portfolio of risky assets.<p>I would like to see reference that attributes this to Markowitz. Markowitz&#x27;s Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) refers to &quot;risk-free&quot; rate but never specifies if fixed income equates to risk free. There is no risk-free assets.

I&#x27;m reposing here because I found it hard to find:<p><i>You think you understand??<p>Submitted by Ngorana of Sinivit, South Coast Baining, Papua New Guinea on August 7, 2012 - 7:49pm<p>I agree that some cultures and child rearing and discipline can be restrictive, but brought up in a similar manner does not mean that we do not value our upbringing - and i do not see it as &#x27;dull&#x27; or &#x27;boring&#x27; or &#x27;wrong&#x27;!\nFrom what I think, in the western society, perception of play and the correct form of discipline to be practiced on children is very different from the most cultures in the east.<p>I must say, that in the previous works stated in the essay, of the Baining people saying little or nothing in interviews is due to the fact, that if you are not a member (specifically foreigner) of the concerned society amongst the Bainings, than you do not necessarily need to acquire knowledge of their cultural or philosophical way of life - except if you are &#x27;married&#x27; into the society, adopted or asked to be part of the society.\nBaining people are very careful with what they say, and to who, especially about cultural practices - it is a taboo to inform foreigners about this.\nWe are people of little talk. We believe more in actions, and that people must read and interpret them correctly. Something of which our children are taught.<p>For Baining&#x27;s of Sinivit of the south coast for example, play is accepted and taken as time-out.\nHowever, adults instill in children that working such as chopping fire wood, diving for fish, gardening, building houses, hunting and gathering is crucial in sustaining your self and your land - especially for males at a later age.\nChildren are taught to be independent and self sufficient and less dependent on their parents or elders at a very young age. This whole concept of not allowing play in our daily lives to me is WRONG.\nThe notion of them becoming young women or men one day is embedded into our thoughts by our elders, and that how we are brought up by them will determine what type of adults we will become.\nIn return, the very existence and state of our land (our heritage) and its affairs depend greatly on our actions. We are taught to become hard workers and very private about our cultural affairs.<p>You see, before the colonial era, we the Baining&#x27;s inhabited the whole of the land of East New Britain.\nInvasion by a neighboring cultural group - the &#x27;Tolai&#x27; people, forced us into the jungles and coastal area due south of the province.\nOur forefathers lost most of our valuable land, and people to cannibalism, practiced amongst these invaders.\nThen during the colonial area, the Germans enslaved them, forcing them into mining our alluvial gold and carrying them hundreds of kilometers inland and storing them away, in what was considered as sacred land - biding us against our cultural beliefs.\nStories of these past events have further created a sense of secrecy in protecting our cultural ways (specifically the fire dance), and our land especially.<p>Baining people do not depend on other related societies to survive out in the natural environment, and land and sea is seen as a commodity of which is treasured and priceless. &#x27;You reap what you sow&#x27;, is highly emphasized in our cultural society - something of which may be deemed archaic in biblical times....<p>And so, in my opinion the essay composed by Dr Grey based on some the works of Fajan&#x27;s is quite biased if you ask me.\nPeople do not have the right to be &#x27;frustrated&#x27; when studying foreign cultures - you simply have to endure it, or stop wasting your time.\nCulture is not just something you record, observe and interpret over time, its how well you integrate yourself into the traditions, beliefs and practices of the people of that particular heritage and understand it and its people.\nMost importantly, you must respect these aspects, as not one culture no matter how much you see it as perfect, is seen as perfect or the correct practice for different cultural societies.</i>",1433112270

There just aren’t any sandwich shops in Germany (this is obviously hyperbole so don’t you dare correct me on this one) and Subway actually is pretty much unique in that regard. (I don’t think bakeries count, cause their selection sandwiches, besides being much, much smaller, is usually not their main focus and also quite different from what you get in a Subway, though that might be a valid counterpoint depending on your perspective.)<p>Obviously there are other fast food options with similar parts, most notably probably Döner Kebab, which is very sandwich-like (grilled meat, often pita bread, salad, cabbage, tomatoes, onions, etc., white and red sauce of some description).<p>I would guess it’s Subway’s main competitor in Germany. Not a chain, since Germany apparently doesn’t do fast food chains. Some cities might have a couple restaurants with the same owner and that’s about it. Now that I think about it that’s actually really weird, but probably not. There are all these chain restaurants in the US and Germany for some weird reason doesn’t really have that at all. It’s either imported (McDonald’s, Burger King, KFC, Pizza Hut) or the odd exception (Maredo, Block House, Joey’s), I guess.<p>It would be interesting to see whether you could build a national Döner chain in Germany.",1433112063

For a chain that can operate inside of shipping containers suspended by crane on high-rise construction sites, they seem to lack the foresight to improve their lengthy process for making a sandwich. Every Subway store you go to seems to be understaffed which just adds to the wait time.<p>Here in Australia if you go to a McDonald&#x27;s in a metropolitan area you&#x27;re literally stepping into a restaurant. They take your order, they seat you and then bring out your food on a wooden board (chips come in a basket). Compare that to Subway, where you stand in line while you watch a student make your sandwich (sometimes in a hasty way) only for the end result to either be cold because they&#x27;re understaffed or fall apart if you take it out of the wrapper.<p>I like Subway, but there are arguably much better sandwich shops out there.

A few high profile sites have been using it, but who else? Several major browsers haven&#x27;t even supported SPDY until quite recently. Most don&#x27;t support HTTP/2 fully yet. And in my search earlier, literally no-one was even talking about how to use some of the new capabilities to best effect server-side, never mind demonstrating server-side software that can actually do it.<p><i>That&#x27;s a very long beta period and gave everyone plenty of time to play around, raise objections, write software, etc.</i><p>You must be joking.<p>The kind of network monitoring and security devices I was talking about have 5-7 figure price tags in US dollars, sales cycles measured in months, purchasing cycles measured in years, and working lifetimes potentially measured in decades. Two years to understand, integrate, fully test, advertise, provide for evaluation, and ultimately sell support for a new protocol is <i>nothing</i> in this industry.<p>Among the projects I have recently worked on, I think three different major web servers were used, a couple of different reverse proxies for load balancing, and assorted other proxies for caching and the like.

They really do literally design and build their own network infrastructure and write a lot of their own software stack instead of buying from the big brands. However, it&#x27;s also true that I could probably count the number of such organisations in the entire world on my fingers.

However, the particular incremental technique of self-adjusting computation has two big flaws:<p>- There is a significant storage overhead due to all of the data that is collected about the computation (the &quot;dynamic dependency graph&quot;).<p>- It makes the assumption that if the input to your algorithm changes a little, the execution path and intermediate variable values will still be the same for most of the computation. This is not true for many algorithms you might wish to make incremental.<p>I&#x27;m not necessarily saying these issues couldn&#x27;t be overcome, but a lot more research is needed.<p>For some other alternatives to incremental computation that avoid these flaws (while introducing other problems of their own), you could look into:<p>DBToaster: <a href=""http://www.dbtoaster.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dbtoaster.org/</a>\nLINVIEW: <a href=""http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2588555.2610519"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2588555.2610519</a>",1433110782

Taylor, a naval architect who served as Chief Constructor of the United States Navy during the First World War and who used the concept (known as a bulbous forefoot) in his design of the USS Delaware, which entered service in 1910, there are earlier examples.<p>Continuing,<p>> The modern bulbous bow was developed by Dr. Takao Inui at the University of Tokyo during the 1950s and 1960s, ... It was eventually found that drag could be reduced by about five percent. Experimentation and refinement slowly improved the geometry of bulbous bows, but they were not widely exploited until computer modelling techniques enabled researchers at the University of British Columbia to increase their performance to a practical level in the 1980s.<p>I presume the experiments in the 1950s and 1960s were done experimentally, and the later CFDs validated through experiment.

If the sales staff never had conflicts of interest when it comes to helping consumers it would probably be a very different story.",1433109917

I found one:<p>Chess<p>Chess works pretty well as a phone-game.  You can blitz against the computer and work through endlessly non-repeating permutations of mid and late game play that you&#x27;d rarely see against human opponents. Playing against your cell phone does not adequately prepare you for human opponents on its own, but it does help you improve your game.<p>While being good at chess if of questionable utility, at least it&#x27;s somewhat respected and can be used in social settings.  It&#x27;s viewed as a skill, unlike being good at flappy bird.",1433109758

The employer mindset is, if I don&#x27;t give this raise, will they walk and do I care.  That&#x27;s why sales guys have the top salaries - its easy to quantify - they bring in - make ALOT of $, or they don&#x27;t and are out of a job.  With Devs its harder, so you make your case.<p>Another thing, managers higher up who make the decisions don&#x27;t necessarily know who is good and who isn&#x27;t.  Especially introvert devs who are the farthest thing from self-promoters.  Your interactions with your boss, annual reviews, kudos, etc.. should give you some idea how well you are liked.  Well liked people get raises because losing them hurts.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t be too timid then - and ask directly.  Not this &quot;can we please discuss further&quot;.  Rather, &quot;I would like a 5% percent raise.  Here is why I deserve it.&quot;  Could be job accomplishments.  Could be speaking, helping marketing, extra-curriculars..  Any chance to quantify with numbers is good.  You&#x27;ll get it, or not - or get part of it.

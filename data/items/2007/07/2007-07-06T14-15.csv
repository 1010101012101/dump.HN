   (trav + 1 (readall (infile file))))
</code></pre>
Anything that appears after two newlines and a blank space is treated as code, till there's a line that doesn't begin with a space.  This is like the markdown convention, but you don't have to use four spaces; one will do.<p>Incidentally, the code above tells me the number of nodes in the code tree of a file.  Not just leaves, which would be <p><pre><code> (len (flat (readall (infile file))))
</code></pre>
but interior nodes as well.  To me this is the best measure of how long a program is.  I used to go by lines of code<p><pre><code> (def codelines (file)
   (w/infile in file 
     (summing test
       (whilet line (readline in)
         (test (aand (find nonwhite line) (isnt it #\;)))))))
</code></pre>
but I found this was encouraging me to do the wrong things.<p>(This kind of test matters because I'm constantly trying to make news.yc shorter as a way of pushing functionality down into Arc.)<p>Here's trav, btw:<p><pre><code> (def trav (f base tree)
   (if (atom tree)
       (base tree)
       (f (trav f base (car tree)) (trav f base (cdr tree)))))
</code></pre>
It traverses a tree, doing something at every node. So e.g. CL copy-tree would be <p><pre><code> (def copy-tree (tree) (trav cons (fn (x) x) tree))
</code></pre>
If you're wondering how the second argument to trav in codetree could be 1, it's because a constant when called as a function simply returns itself.  This turns out to be quite handy.<p>",1183733640

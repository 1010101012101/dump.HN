Be this loyalty programs or agreeing to cookies on a website (see UK cookie notification policy). This is a commonly accepted personal choice even if a user doesn&#x27;t entirely understand what they are agreeing.<p>2) There is a hell of a lot of money in measurement/advertising.

Do you think people will move on mass away from  free services like gmail/hotmail/Facebook and pay $10/mth when they can get it free in exchange for some tracking?<p>4) General apathy - consider the mass society reaction, or lack of reaction, to the Snowden revelations.

Remember the first Apple II predated the first IBM PC by four years! Each platform had a different set of enthusiasts, and at least early x86 PCs were more business-centric.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t compare the Apple IIgs to an 386 PC. It&#x27;s not really a fair comparison; the poor IIgs would be outclassed. It&#x27;s 2.8 MHz 65C816 processor was 16 bits and introduced in 1983.<p>The 386 benefited from two years of technological advances when it was introduced in 1985, and had 32-bit registers and a 32-bit data bus (2^32 bits==4GB of physical RAM). It shipped at 16 MHz. (A better comparison would probably be the contemporaneous 68000 family vs. the x86 line.)<p>More broadly, Apple didn&#x27;t have a lot of great options circa 1984-1985. The original Mac was slow, black and white only, didn&#x27;t support hard drives, etc., but at least enjoyed a modern architecture. The Apple II was still selling well, and bankrolling Mac development, but was falling behind its x86-based rivals (yay 64KB bank switching!). So you keep the cash cow alive for a while longer with the IIgs until the Mac reaches critical mass.<p>Apple II enthusiasts still resent John Sculley & co (though Steve Jobs would probably have been more ruthless) for this betrayal. :)",1438670792

It&#x27;s possible to sandbox code, but as soon as you allow any communication at all, there&#x27;s no automated way to prevent data theft.&quot;<p>It turns out, it is possible with information flow control (IFC). The
simple idea behind IFC is to protect data by labeling/tagging it and
restricting code according to the kinds of labeled data it reads. Once
code in an execution context (e.g., iframe or process) reads some
labeled data, IFC restricts where it can further communicate. In the
simplest form: once you read data that is SECRET, you can&#x27;t write to
any PUBLIC communication channel. (You can, of course, write to a

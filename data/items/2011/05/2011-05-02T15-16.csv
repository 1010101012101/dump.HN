We are currently expanding the API to the client-side (JS API), to make a cleaner client interface with Javascript text chat and Flash video/audio chat. Everything will be customizable.<p>Distala appeared lately (around February), to give a complete example of a typical API's implementation. And is finally a complete service.<p>For the technologies used:\nWe mostly used Java (with pieces of C++ for JNI).\nWe have a cloud-based relay system that enables efficient scalability, all over the world.\nInstallers are generated with Install4J (a really great tool).\nAnd distala is a PHP/JS/MySQL website.<p>The professional version isn't out right now, but will soon be available.<p>Thx all",1304351821

Sometimes also due to various tax subsidies (e.g., green energy tax credits in the case of GE).<p><i>Are the tax policies of most nations unfair to corporations?</i><p>I didn't say it was unfair to corporations. I don't believe that a claim like ""unfair to corporations"" even makes logical sense.<p>I said it was unfair to their owners. Consider your hypothetical business owner. Out of the $100k in profits, the business pays perhaps $20k. The business owner then pays another $15k. But then people trying to score political points complain that he is getting away with something, and paying only $15k on $80k (19%). I think that's unfair.<p>Under my proposal, the business pays $0k and the owner pays $35k. This way, he gets to take (moral/political) credit for the taxes he pays just like a salaried employee.

You need to hit every source of talent and try your damn best to get the best. Failing that, settle for someone who is only as good as you are. This is monumentally important with your first 4-5 hires as it sets the bar and sets the culture.<p>For job seekers:<p>They are interviewing you, but YOU are also interviewing THEM. If you are not passionate about what they are doing, it's probably not a good fit. If they are unwilling to listen to you give a better solution than the one they thought of, there's probably something wrong with their culture. If they are offended that you found a bug in their code or test, that's a huge red flag already.<p>Now, in big companies you can get away with coasting along, working as a simple code monkey. If that's what you want (not saying it's a bad thing), then you need neither passion nor aptitude to get a decent wage working an easy job.<p>If, however, you crave something bigger and more rewarding, you need to seek out companies that are passionate about the same things you are.

Along the way, we've really pushed the devices to their limits and have something special that doesn't rely on the cloud for service, doesn't copy old and crappy ""100 buttons on a screen"" POS interfaces, and is still just as efficient and much more usable. Combining Bonjour (Apple's implementation of zeroconf) with the excellent Cocoa APIs also made it a relatively magical experience - you can literally watch on an iPad as a waiter takes an order on a iPod connected to the iPad.<p>This is my first time as an entrepreneur, and we're trying to bootstrap out of Buffalo, NY. I'd love to hear any advice you have on marketing to a relatively hard to reach segment such as restaurants, and any feedback you have on the app itself. The app is available for free (trial version that doesn't allow adding menu items or allow complete printing of checks to receipt printers) at http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ambur/id408723017?mt=8&ls=1 , and our website is http://www.refulgentsoftware.com<p>Thanks for your time!",1304350945

If I want to know about you, I can just check your FB in a few seconds and know months of data about you. FB also includes lists of your contacts, logs of (some) communications, pictures of you, and maybe location data to boot.<p>Also, all of everyone's information is now available from a single broker. With law-enforcement API's that (I'm assuming) FB provides, it's possible to track thousands of people in real-time for months without leaving the room or investing in lots of equipment.

At least in idealized theory, a stock is worth the time-discounted value of its future dividends plus any terminal liquidation payout (if the company eventually gets sold for cash). A share buyback increases the share of a company that a given stockholder owns, by getting rid of some of the other outstanding shares. That should make the share more valuable, because it's now entitled to a larger percentage of those future earnings... but raising the percentage of future earnings you're entitled to is only valuable if there are any! So either there have to eventually be some dividends or a cash sale, or else we have to abandon that view of valuation as having any tie to future earnings.",1304348513

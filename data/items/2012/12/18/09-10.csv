You're used to high information density, utilization of screen real estate to show as much as possible on one screen to avoid a user needing to navigate away? Forget that on Modern UI. Whitespace rules, it is like the GMail redesign on steroids<p>Hold it there. They are called guidelines [1] because they're <i>guidelines</i>. You don't <i>have</i> to enforce them! That said, they're there for a reason! The reason is that you use your finger on tablets, not a high-precision mouse device. Seriously, have you tried operating Excel on a touch device?<p>Second, who says enterprise apps can't be made with this kind of UI? Some guys succeed [2]. You just have to think new.

Nearly any account change requires reauthenticating with your password, and only recently did they start to roll out support for a more persistent auth for viewing what most people would consider non-critical info (order history, etc).  With the exception of a phone-based password reset - which should not cause a problem like the one described here - they could require even a web-based PIN (behind the login-wall, of course) for chat and phone support; live chat could skip this if the user already has a fresh auth.<p>I hope for everyone's sake that Amazon is able to prevent this kind of problem without harming their fantastic customer support.

It seems that their new TOS explicitly lays out that your photos may be used in advertising, possibly due to a new law somewhere requiring specific notification and release, but my understanding is that <i>you'd already given them this right</i> based on this clause:<p><i>By displaying or publishing (""posting"") any Content on or through the Instagram Services, you hereby grant to Instagram a non-exclusive, fully paid and royalty-free, worldwide, limited license to use, modify, delete from, add to, publicly perform, publicly display, reproduce and translate such Content, including without limitation distributing part or all of the Site in any media formats through any media channels, except Content not shared publicly (""private"") will not be distributed outside the Instagram Services.</i><p>Yes, that's in the <i>old</i> TOS, and it's pretty much boilerplate for any site with user-generated content. That language certainly seems to me like it would cover uses in advertising or even Instagram reselling your images as a ""stock photo"" site. This kind of clause is required so that users can't attempt to entrap the service provider by uploading content and then claiming that Instagram didn't have a license to utilize it and therefore had violated copyright, and also probably as a fallback policy in case a cranky user spotted their image in a stream or feed or video or something (or, alternately, that the server is hacked and db is leaked, and thousands of claims of ""unauthorized use"" come flooding in).<p>IANAL but pretty much this is a non-story.

4936679,comment,4934161,4936101,2,0,meaty,,,"Knowing where to look and what order to do things in is the key to success on this. Without understanding in a reasonable order you're screwed, hence your Vcc problem. If you dredge through the basics up to BJTs, you would suddenly realise that it's ""voltage common collector"" (or +v). This kind of demonstrates my point. This is no personal reflection of your progress - just an observation.<p>With all the free resources out there, it's probably best to do the following. This is my personal recommendation and it's what I throw people towards who want a solid understanding of the subject:<p>1. Start with Khan Academy and do at least up to the end of Linear Algebra. Make sure you cover trig as well. Do the first few sections on arithmetic with a calculator or skip them if you can't be bothered. Arithmetic isn't all that important in maths. Grab a reasonably new Casio calc with solver and calculus functions such as FX-991ES as well.<p>2. Pick up the NEETS guides from [1] and work through the first module [2] until you get a rough understanding of what electricity is. Some eye openers in there which surprise a lot of people.<p>3. Grab a copy of ""the art of electronics"" and the associated student guide and work through the latter using the former as a reference ONLY (seriously the latter is an awesome book which contains some real practical hints and tips that are missing from everything else). The main art of electronics is a disjoint mess of information but the student guide uses the right approach.<p>4. Move slowly to AC circuits, referring back to Khan Academy if you get stuck on the maths and NEETS as the fundamental information.<p>5. Rinse and repeat. You will be able to chose your own path when you get through those bits.<p>Also, best advice in the world - buy an analogue oscilloscope - an old 25MHz one can be had on ebay for virtually nothing. It doesn't have to be a nice one - just something that works. I've got one that is 35 years old that is fine - it cost me $20! Ignore those digital ones - they're a piece of shit unless you want to spend upwards of $500.<p>You can probably do the whole series in a year or so with $100-200 investment which is less than an iPhone.<p>If you get royally stuck, visit <a href=""http://forum.allaboutcircuits.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://forum.allaboutcircuits.com/</a> and there are plenty of us who will help you out.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.phy.davidson.edu/instrumentation/NEETS.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.phy.davidson.edu/instrumentation/NEETS.htm</a><p>[2] When I say work through the modules, I mean buy some components and actually build some stuff and play with it rather than just mindlessly sap up the theory.",1355821672

Residents had long complained about vendors inflating prices and rigging scales. They liked the way Wal-Mart challenged the old irritants of the Mexican shopping experience  stores that do not list prices; stores with no parking; stores with musty display cases.</i><p>I can relate to the above here in Bangladesh. The local grocery chains as well as the mom and pop stores are notorious for price discrepancies but worse than that - they sell food that has been adulterated and even laced with chemicals. With Wal-Mart consumers would at least get better quality food relative to those sold by local businesses.",1355821549

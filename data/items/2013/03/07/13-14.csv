Rather, it's a hardship with all client/server apps, specifically in that trusting any client requires additional support from the platform (self-assertion or possession of a secret by the client alone is insufficient) and even then it's known hard problem.<p>This has been true of client/server apps for a very long time, well predating any particular protocol. I'd be sincerely interested in any solutions that people come up with that don't depend on additional extrinsic platform capabilities.",1362664791

If there's no assignment statement, there can't be any side effects.  If there are no side effects, you can't race conditions or concurrent update problems.  You can't have resource leaks.  You can't have order dependencies.<p>Does Clojure guarantee all these things?  Not entirely; because Clojure allows you to invoke the java stack, which is decidedly not immutable; and because clojure provides mechanisms for changing state; albeit with significant discipline imposed.<p>The end result is that clojure is _much_ safer to use in complex and multi-threaded systems, and is likely much, _much_ safer in extreme multi-core applications.",1362664560

In fact, the only countries who have ever adopted a no first use policy are the USSR/Russia (for 2 decades, but not any more), India (this is apparently more ambiguous now) and China (who continue to hold to it).<p>Wikipedia briefly mentions a North Korean pledge to the same effect, but I think this latest news shows that we should probably not take that too seriously.",1362664495

On a desktop it's not possible to authenticate clients because whatever they do, the information can be extracted and simulated by a malicious client.<p>The other thing is that by now many desktop OAuth clients embed a webview for the authentication handshake. There is no way for the user to be sure that they are typing their credentials into the site they think they are. There is no browser chrome, there is usually no URL bar and even if there was, there is zero trust that the URL is actually showing the correct URL.<p>Worse: How many client apps are actually going through the trouble of checking SSL certificates (or even that SSL is on)?<p>Embedding a webview for an OAuth handshake provides (to the user) no additional security compared to just showing a username/password dialog.<p>The only way how I see this actually work is if the application opens the default browser for the handshake. But of course that will show a big-ass security warning when redirecting back to the local url protocol.<p>In consequence this means that the only method by which OAuth on the desktop could provide additional security is the one method that presents a security warning to the user.

5337428,comment,5337011,5337011,4,0,drewcrawford,,,"This was a very strange story to see, because my life is almost a mirror image of the author's.  Except my harebrained ORM-powered RPC message-queue rest-was-too-slow experiment is working so far.  Consider this a counterstory.<p>The author lists two problems with the old system: code re-use and speed.  But he doesn't really say how the solution is going to improve on the status quo, other than just by throwing programmers at the problem and hoping they improve on REST. Now maybe they had clear solutions and maybe they didn't--but the post doesn't say.<p>I sympathize with the author's problems.  But I also started with specific clarity about the problems and strong solutions about how in practice to improve.  For example, the speed problem for my use case was very specifically that latency was too high.  Latency was too high specifically because of fast-lived connections, the SSL handshake, and TCP overhead.  So I designed a system very specifically around long-lived connections, a non-SSL based crypto layer, and UDP.  It's a full order of magnitude faster; it actually changes the way you use network calls because they are so cheap now.  As time has gone on I have extended the speed improvements, but it was way better than the status quo on day one.<p>Similarly for code reuse, I had a very narrow set of problems surrounding reusing across client/server only very specific parts of very specific classes.  As a result, rare is the change that requires moving client and server in lockstep.  I don't think I did it in the month of February.  And the productivity gain was great from day one.<p>I am the first to admit that I've had some bugs in the complicated pipeline that require Deep Magic to comprehend.  I have one or two open right now.  But, if you have a 10x runtime improvement and a 3x development improvement, spending a day or two learning the ins and outs of Deep Magic is not the worst thing you can do.<p>I think the moral to this story, if there is one, is don't fly by the seat of your pants.  Don't write a system that is faster, write one that is exactly 92.56% faster by the application of two specific techniques.  Don't write an RPC system that eliminates the barriers for sharing arbitrary code, write an RPC system that eliminates two particular barriers for classes that meet three known requirements that most people in the organization are annoyed about.

The author might do better writing another one in a few years or learning to use diagrams to convey architecture (but for god's sake don't bother with UML!).<p>Architecturally, the changes discussed seem to be (1) From a standard protocol to some customization for premature optimization purposes (unmeasured results), and back to a standard protocol. (2) From service abstraction through higher-layer communication to service-dependency through direct database connectivity. (3) From code duplication between client/server to the use of a centralized model. (4) From multiple codebases to a single codebase.<p>My take: (1) Is premature optimization, needless complexity and was ultimately a waste of time. (2) A change so completely fundamentally different with a view towards system architecture (security, resource allocation, proxy/WAN/potential-client-range, etc.) that it is hard to analyze; ultimately it suggests a complete misunderstanding or rescoping of the original problem. (3) Generating code or behaviour from models is very often a great idea. While up-front complexity may appear slightly larger, it means you can retarget your code to other languages/platforms much more easily, without the inefficies and syntax-learning overheads of partial-but-similar strategies through runtime abstraction libraries.

What someone does with their own mail client is between them and their provider - and that's in the cases where marking as spam is even sent to the provider, which is not the standard behaviour.<p>>  if you decide ""spam filters should be used to determine whether people are in compliance with the CAN SPAM Act"", the law states you are actually allowed to have interfaces that include ""menus"" as part of the opt-out to determine what should be opted out of (as you may want to continue receiving some e-mail, but not things like that).<p>You seem to imagine that ""spam"" is purely a legal definition because there exists an act of congress that seeks to limit it. The term long predates the act, and the capabilities we have developed to fight it do not depend on the specifics of US law. Do I, or any regular mail user, care that the law allows menus? No, make us jump through hoops and we get mad.

Gmail has great filters for example, and very rarely do most power users need to trawl through their spam folder for mis-filed messages. For most users, spammy behaviour by ""legitimate"" senders is much more pressing. If people <i>really</i> love your content, one-click unsubscribe is not going to keep them from it. If you put obstacles in the way of unsubscription, if you make it <i>easier</i> for them to mark you as spam (or filter you out, whatever), they will do so. My time, and the time spent by millions of mail users, is worth something, and is not to be wasted by mass-mailers' borderline behaviour.<p>So if you are one of these, I suggest you to give serious consideration to the hard-pressed user's experience of email.",1362662206

But I can probably come up with something slightly more valuable to offer at ~250.<p>As for CoffeeScript support -- the only major piece missing there is an error-tolerant CoffeeScript parser. Given that, one could simply run the CoffeeScript compiler over code, and analyze the output. There'd be some shuffling with source maps needed to translate source locations in the various representations of the code, but that's a solved problem. Well, and of course you might see some translation artifacts. The CS output code is semantically close to the input, but there are differences.",1362661624

It can even fake an address bar with a twitter.com URL if it wants.

I&#x27;m finw with a single provider of roads, provided they are not toll roads but rather &quot;dumb&quot; roads that let me go when and where I please. This is in contrast to government-sanctioned but opportunistically managed toll-roads with dynamic pricing that rips me off every time I have an important meeting to get to by turning into a &quot;protection racket&quot; for my important business.<p>The rest of the stuff about &quot;fair&quot; x or y is not really relevant. Markets are supposed to be &quot;free&quot; and not &quot;rigged&quot;, but neither of these two concepts imply &quot;fair&quot; in the sense you are using it. Every company on the NYSE hasi its own cost of capital--is that &#x27;fair&#x27;? no. its not fair to the owners. But that does not imply that the market is not free for capiral or that the market for capital is &#x27;rigged&#x27;.<p>There are plenty of ways that government services can be provided to extend markets geographic reach, variety, and product depth without getting into some nasty discussion of socialism/totalitarianism etc. There are some services that are more-efficiently organized through the government. In that respect, a government entity is just like a non-profit that competes with a for-profit or private foundation entity (eg universities). And more ...",1398412601

From my experience (Pocket, Readability, Readable (now Evernote Clearly), Boilerpipe) that&#x27;s the big differentiator. But frankly, with the increased use of media queries, I find myself using this view less and less, and the only feature I miss is pagination.<p>The optimal reading environment on a responsive website is usually the tablet view. Narrow enough to make jumping lines easy, narrow enough to prevent big ads on the side columns. I&#x27;d love to see a tool that could force media queries on bigger displays and simply center the text. You&#x27;d still get a feel for what the web designer was going for, but it&#x27;s much cleaner. On none responsive sites, it could use the same metrics as this tool to determine which elements are article elements and simply center them and remove the rest, while maintaining the fonts, colors...

After obsessing over sundry services like YouTube I finally just decided to delete the account - playlists and all, since services like that are basically huge wastes of time anyway.<p>Right now I&#x27;m carrying a phone that doesn&#x27;t even support e-mail, never mind web, and honestly have no intention of changing the situation unless forced by an employer. It&#x27;s great, the battery lasts about 2 weeks. The only real aspect of this that hurt initially was the lack of a good GPS, but since I don&#x27;t own a car and live in a big city, turns out it was just another excuse to pointlessly glue my head to a screen",1398409625

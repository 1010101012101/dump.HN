Millions of people are already invested in Facebook. Fads are easy to change. Its not easy to opt out of Facebook because your friends drag you back. I cannot go and join another network because none of my friends are there.<p>2. You say the social OS is poorly executed but you have to remember its early days and I am eager to see how the integration of Parakey will change Facebook. You are right when you say there is a lot of app crap, however slowly but surely I expect better more useful apps to be developed as Facebook become more professional. Its a fun social network at the moment but I've seen my friends profiles change significantly since joining megacorp. Their profiles are now like resumes.<p>3.

Us guys and girls in the tech community may start a fuss, but Facebook now has millions of members. We can be ignored and if the majority of people don't care, I doubt Facebook will change things.<p>Conclusion - Its too early to tell were Facebook is going (they probably don't even know).

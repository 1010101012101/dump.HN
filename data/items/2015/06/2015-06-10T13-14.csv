9692190,comment,9690309,9690400,0,0,joshstrange,,,"Not the same thing but in Middle School we used our &quot;id numbers&quot; for passwords everywhere. They were also helpfully printed on all of our schedules which a number of students simply slid into the front see-through plastic sleeve on their binders making it trivial to get nearly anyone&#x27;s password. I wanted to see if there was a pattern to the id numbers (to see if given some info I could guess the id number) so I started collecting them passively. Just writing down the name of the student and their id number and storing them all in a program called HyperStudio (This was like powerpoint for mac but much more kid friendly and easier scripting) which I hid behind a number of hidden buttons on a project that looked legit (No clue why I did this, I could have just stored them in a text file but I wanted to play with HS some more and hiding them felt more fun). I never got to the point that I could discern any pattern because I very stupidly read off a student&#x27;s id number when they pissed me off for shock value (I was in middle school, cut me a break) and they told the teacher and by the end of the day I was sitting in the principal&#x27;s office. I got in a bit of trouble and lost computer access for the rest of the year (that really sucked) but I&#x27;m just glad it didn&#x27;t happen in today&#x27;s climate where I probably could have been charged with computer hacking/fraud charges. Like elwell I never once considered using it for malicious reasons and honestly I only logged into 1-2 accounts to confirm they worked but the vast majority I had no interest in looking at their network share folder (They were just full of a bunch of school assignments after all). Looking back it was extremely stupid and could have resulted in much worse consequences. That said I stand by my opinion at the time that they were blowing it WAY out of proportion and used the word &quot;hacked&quot; a number of times when really all I did was observe data that students were exposing right on the outside of their binders. I only lost computer access because I stored the numbers on a computer which to me at the time and now seems like some pretty stupid reasoning but whatever.",1433944752

9692186,comment,9691002,9692003,0,0,exelius,,,"> 1) Developers cannot reliably estimate software timelines. That often comes with experience and age, but many never learn that skill. It is a skill like programming itself. It comes with practice.<p>This is true. But this is the problem that Agile is supposed to help solve -- with the caveat that most companies don&#x27;t do true Agile. I guess people are now calling it Continuous Delivery, but the idea is the same: you don&#x27;t tell people when a feature will be done, only when you will be working on it. But even then, even with experienced estimators, the rule of thumb is to add 15-30% to their estimates.<p>> 2) Break down in communication between management (product managers) and engineers who are writing code.<p>Totally agree that this is very common. Unfortunately, the best way to solve this is with process, and developers hate process. But developers often don&#x27;t realize that they can use the process to their advantage: a strong engineering lead can refuse to accept poorly defined requirements. That allows you to push back on product to force them to define the requirement better.<p>IMO this breakdown is caused by just that: developers who say &quot;oh yeah, I can do that&quot;, then start working on the problem and realize that there are a lot of undefined edge cases. If they promised it to the client in 6 months, fine, but define what &quot;it&quot; is.<p>From the perspective of an MBA, if we have to bring in a contractor to implement it, fine. I know where I can go to hire certified rockstar contract developers at $200/hr, which I will do if the client is lucrative enough. There is no feature I can think of that would take more than 6 months of development.",1433944711
9692185,comment,9689240,9690616,0,0,6stringmerc,,,"Well, I&#x27;d like to call shenanigans on your calling BS.<p>1. Distribution is the first step to social interest and therefore marketability. As in, until a tune gets heard by a marketing person or a film maker or Joe Q. Concert-Goer, it&#x27;s relatively useless to have a recording. Fundamentally speaking, this is why Radio airplay is considered advertising and not due significant compensation.<p>2. The source of the money to go on tour is relevant, but not prohibitive. Willie Nelson is/was adamant that every musician needs a very good Jewish lawyer (his words). Contracts and getting paid are extremely important to longevity, whether it be licensing or crafting a tour.<p>3. I don&#x27;t see how this point genuinely contradicts the parent assertion. Making a living in music is difficult, it always has been, and adding one additional layer of overhead - a label - is simply that - another layer of overhead. It goes back to having a lawyer / manager / publicist - sure, paying them XX% might seem expensive, but the amount of money that can be obtained as a gross sum will, hopefully, be larger on the net take-home basis.<p>Artists don&#x27;t need labels - they need publicity. Labels have traditionally worked themselves into all sorts of publicity avenues such as...<i>deep breath</i>...rack jobbers - payola - 360 contract deals - ghost writing / manufacturing pop stars - digital rights management - pay-for-publicity on blogs...there are plenty of examples of labels creating successes and gambling on the small timers that they want to be successful. Now, Sony and Universal Music Group will sign distribution deals with labels for which they have no fiscal kick-back. It&#x27;s a lesser known process, but essential for getting sh!t on the rack @ Best Buy (see: Macklemore).<p>No, what artists need are equitable channels for distribution and competent management for business affairs. You like Chvrches? I like Chvrches a lot. I especially dig the Soundcloud hat Martin Doherty seems to wear non-stop in gratitude for it being their big break / ability to negotiate their own terms in the modern system...but what excites me the most is what Chance the Rapper is doing along with Donnie Trumpet and the Social Experiment. No label. Free release. Now what? Time will tell.",1433944705

My wife works 40 hours per week at a local government facility, and I work the same schedule at a private company.

It&#x27;s been a drain on both of us mentally and emotionally, and if we weren&#x27;t so amazingly compatible it would be an issue in our marriage.

Then you&#x27;re looking for a full time job along with everyone else who was doing short term contracts at a time when companies are scaling back hiring. Most of you are going to have a bad time.<p>A full-time job offers some protection from volatility. I&#x27;m not going to pretend that nobody has ever been laid off from a full-time job, but if you work contracts you have ZERO job security. And contractors are the first thing to go in cost cutting mode.<p>If you go the independent contractor route, make sure your emergency fund can cover 18-24 months of expenses. Also, recognize that while the pay may be higher, if you&#x27;re in the US you also are on the hook for 8% payroll tax that your employer would normally pay on your behalf.<p>If you go this route, you need to adjust your definition of &quot;well off&quot;. If you are looking to keep pace with your friends working at Google and making $150k, that&#x27;s pretty unlikely. But you can probably pull $60k and still meet your savings goals, and $60k/yr is more than enough to live comfortably on. And that number won&#x27;t be static; some years you might make $100k and some years you might make $20k. You need your savings to be able to survive the lean years.<p>All that said, based on your comment I assume you have no work experience. Why would you hire yourself for a short-term contract over someone else? Go work somewhere full-time for at least a few years until you have a good answer for that question.

I do not mean that as a sarcastic statement or something, I mean, seriously, changing a codebase or specification base the size of the browser from cooperative to pre-emptive is an incredible and very difficult change.

That often comes with experience and age, but many never learn that skill. It is a skill like programming itself. It comes with practice.<p>2) Break down in communication between management (product managers) and engineers who are writing code.<p>On the first part. Usually junior software developers simply have not had experience shipping software in a full software cycle. From initial requirements, to design,  to deployment, to maintenance. They did projects perhaps in school and homework exercises. Later some eventually learn that they chronically underestimate the time, and just start adding a factor (2x) to what their initial estimate is. That is a step up. But many never learn. There is also a race to the bottom -- the ones that promise shorter timelines get promoted and seen as smarter, more aggressive, better team players. The ones that are realistic are seen as maybe &quot;taking it easy&quot;, &quot;not working hard enough&quot;. Then everyone sees who gets promoted and show doesn&#x27;t and learn -- &quot;Aha I need to be like cool cowboy coder Joe over there, he is now running his own department&quot;. And so it spreads. Notice how there is often no feedback loop to punish the cool cowboy coder after the project is not delivered on time.<p>On the second part -- even if there are engineers who know how to estimate the time, nobody asks them. Because the person who promised the feature already played golf with the customer and told them they&#x27;ll get the new shiny toy in 6 months. That person might have never been a developer, they might have an MBA or where a football coach or something like that.  And they usually have a higher position in the company. So they promise and then everyone is pushed to deliver on that deadline. If it fails the failure is usually attributed to the engineers doing the work because they haven&#x27;t worked &quot;hard enough&quot;.",1433943325

Spending the bulk of every weekday in an office doing what you&#x27;re told is not fun. If it was, then people would do it for free. Day to day work is generally unglamorous and boring.<p>I think part of the blame is that tech employers permeate this notion that one must &quot;love&quot; their work. So we feel guilty for not enjoying cleaning up somebody else&#x27;s legacy code, fixing that tracking bug, or god forbid solving an IE8 bug.<p>I totally agree with the author that the tickets we&#x27;re assigned are all puzzles that I <i>could</i> lose myself in and inevitably get some feeling of satisfaction when I figure it out. But in the grand scheme of things, most of us aren&#x27;t working on problems of real significance (eg. curing cancer, creating a more efficient battery). Most of us are just reinventing some form of wheel. And most of the problems we solve as implementors don&#x27;t pertain to us. Rarely do we capture any of the fruits of our labor aside from a &quot;great job!&quot; and a 10% pay bump at the end of the year if we&#x27;re lucky.<p>We as employees need to change the culture of employment. Nobody should have to pretend to enjoy grunt work. Work should be about the output you produce, not face time or tracking hours. Being in an office 8 hrs/day and never seeing the sun is depressing, and it&#x27;s time we acknowledge that and fight to improve the situation.<p>We can start by demanding that remote work be accepted by our employers. That immediately gives us back our entire commutes (even just one hour a day is huge when you spend the majority of your waking hours in an office and thus only have 6 hours of real free time). And we can demand the freedom to work on our own schedules rather than being confined to 9-5, which we all know for most people is bullshit because we&#x27;re not on an assembly line and our most productive work doesn&#x27;t necessarily follow a 9-5 schedule.",1433943311

9691958,comment,9690703,9690703,0,0,tryp,,,"A few years ago I implemented the storage system for a special-purpose diagnostic camera. The specification defined (very long) filenames for the saved images using a timestamp and some other data. I used a mostly off-the-shelf microcontroller/NAND/USB mass storage reference implementation, hooked it up a side-channel to the FPGA, and had everything working pretty nicely. Until the test harness that just continuously commanded pictures to be taken reached 105 iterations. After that, the camera timed out waiting on the storage subsystem to store the image.<p>The problem turned out to be the code that found the 8.3 filename: it did the longfi~1.bin, checked to see if that file existed and if so, incremented to longfi~2.bin, then checked that... but never did the checksum trick described here, just kept iterating. (bear in mind this was a tiny 8-bit microcontroller that didn&#x27;t have the RAM to just read all the directory entries at once and keep them around for comparison) Finding the proper 8.3 filename this way took longer than the timeout period after 104 collisions.<p>Of course, we only cared about the long filename and never saw the 8.3 filename, so my fix was simply to use an appropriate hash of the long filename to ensure a good probability of uniqueness.",1433942984

There is the foreign income exemption which essentially says that the IRS does not care to tax the first $100,000 you earn. For taxes above that, you first deduct dollar for dollar what you have paid to the foreign tax authority. Ball-parking it, you would have to earn more than $180,000 per year to need to pay US taxes. You still have to file US taxes, which is a cost and an inconvenience, but is manageable.<p>Of course, you must be genuinely living abroad to apply for this. This means either spending enough time outside of the US (> 330 days in a tax year, if I recall correctly) or have enough proof that you are really living abroad (things like primary residence in your name, bills, bank accounts, mortgage, insurance, kids at school -- regular every day stuff).<p>Now if you want to game the system and just &quot;kind of&quot; live abroad in order to take advantage of the income exemption, that&#x27;s a different story.",1433941887

You&#x27;ll note they go well beyond falls, though you have a point that the page in question mentions roof installations.<p>But also keep in mind that solar also causes mining deaths (sand quarries are not without accidents just because they&#x27;re not deep mines; but of course nuclear has related mining accidents too) as well as work with hazardous chemicals during production of the cells. There are also related fire risks. Not huge, but they are there, and given sufficiently deployed capacity it adds up.<p>Also keep in mind that solar is not nearly all photovoltaics. Here&#x27;s an article about a lethal accident at a concentrating solar power plant in South Africa [3], though generally we will likely see fewer deaths per kwh for large plants. But even fields full of solar panels involves plenty of construction work and electrical work that can kill.<p>Basically, anything labour intensive, no matter what, will have a death toll. Even hiring a bunch of people to sit around and do nothing all day will have a death toll from accidents one way or another. As such, all else being equal (and of course they never are), the least labour intensive alternative will win out. Similarly, all else beiny equal, the larger / more electrical installations you add the more fires etc. you will have.<p>Since all things are not equal, it gets complicated, but it doesn&#x27;t help to pretend that these alternatives does not have risks.<p>> Leave rooftop solar installation to those who build new homes or repair the roof, so there&#x27;s no additional risk from climbing around in high places.<p>They&#x27;re not immune to death just because they have experience, and there will always be additional risk because it means more time is spent climbing around in high places. There&#x27;s been plenty of professional installers and construction workers falling to their deaths too. The pages I referenced are targeted at professionals, for a reason.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.osha.gov/dep/greenjobs/solar.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.osha.gov/dep/greenjobs/solar.html</a>

But the lesson of Smalltalk is that &quot;better&quot; isn&#x27;t just in the technical details. It lives in the model of community that it&#x27;s speakers adopt. People speak C and JavaScript because they rode along free with Unix and the browser. Even in it&#x27;s darkest days, Lisp tagged along in AutoCad and Emacs. These languages had practical purposes that let them compete outside of the &quot;what language should I build my next project in&quot; marketplace and outside the segment of professional software developers.<p>Smalltalk was killed by its business models.

On looking out the window, a small woman dressed head to toes in a chador (black cloak covering everything but the face) insisted we come to breakfast and shower. The wife was still sleeping so we politely declined. 30 minutes later she came back, more banging and insisted, confused why we hadn&#x27;t come yet, we need to eat and have to shower. She all but grabbed the wife by the hand and dragged her to her house. She put on a mighty fine spread for breakfast. Took our daughter to show her to the neighbour, then took her to the shop to buy food for the lunch she would cook for us. She called her husband, got him to come back from work (he spoke a little English). Put the cable tv and got out a secret stash of homemade red wine and some whiskey.

For finding prospective partners you also don&#x27;t talk about money (that is hardly ever done in Germany - kind of a social taboo), but you talk a lot about education (indirectly you get from which class the other person is and/or how much money they will probably make in the future). You increase your chances very much if you have some kind of academic education that the other one respects (what kind of this is, is a really complicated game, but tendencies are: medicine - great, mathematics - good (at least if you are still sociable; great if you have a PhD), humanities - it&#x27;s complicated ;-( , female engineer or computer scientist - great). Nearly all of the male PhD students in mathematics at the same floor as me that are married, are married to a female medicine student. I don&#x27;t consider this as a coincidence. The same holds for other &quot;educational&quot; topics, say preferred taste of music (if you want to move up, it&#x27;s surely not bad to like classical music) or whether you play(ed) a musical instrument (good sign if both did) (which is also considered as a kind of education in Germany).<p>So, yes, in Germany you don&#x27;t talk about class, but by talking about education you get lots of cues.",1433941256

I could easily seeing less-than-profitable but creative hobbies being way more interesting for hypothetical cleaners who were wealthy and wanted to stay busy.<p>I felt the same way until I actually met a wealthy cleaner. All I can say is never underestimate the power of habit and the difficulty of breaking routines.<p>I used to intern at a small investment manager years ago where one of the clients was a cleaning lady. Every couple weeks she would come into the office to deposit a portion of her modest housecleaning income into her investment account. I didn't think much of it until I found out she was actually a multi-millionaire. This cleaner had been investing with the investment manager for years and (at ~20% annual returns) her small contributions compounded into millions of dollars. It was pretty mind blowing. Why didn't she just retire!? She just loved her job and the routine...<p>Anyway, the best part is she refers her high net worth customers all the time to the fund and they all sheepishly try to explain how they heard about the fund from their cleaning lady. Little did they know that their house cleaner was actually richer than them.",1346277531

It never came to dominate the market, and one can argue about the reasons it never displaced Macintosh (still less Windows). It <i>probably</i> has a lot to do with lack of a single, unified vision, and the market fragmentation caused by the different distros, and the lack of market pressure to ship, as it relies on volunteer labor, but I'm not going to presume.<p>Personally, I've been primarily a Mac user since the Mississippian superperiod, but I used an X-11 Windows()  environment (on top of FreeBSD) for years at work. I don't miss it, even one iota, but I know plenty of smart people who prefer that sort of thing. <i>De gustibus non disputandum est</i> and all that.",1346277514

For iOS native app testing, I'm investigating tools written on top of Apple's UIAutomation API -- specifically the ""ios-auto"" project by Dan Cuellar at Zoosk.

I've spent a fair bit of time having to customise a window manager (awesomewm), just to get a somewhat usable desktop environment.

Under linux my macbook air only sleeps reliably half the time, and occasionally I find that unbeknownst to me some process has woken the laptop (with lid closed) in my bag, with the battery near critical. The latest apt-get update broke my sound. Empathy hangs for a good 2-3 minutes on load, but eventually recovers. Something mysteriously reverts my xmodmap keybinds mid-session. Other little things such as LightDM not starting until I hit enter at a black screen post boot contribute to an overall experience that feels frustratingly incomplete.<p>I know that many of these are trivial complaints and that all of these things can be fixed. I no longer want to have to do this however. In my teens I loved tinkering with the linux desktop, designing 'awesome' Enlightenment themes and enjoyed tracking down and fixing these little problems. Now in my 30s I really just want the OS to get out of the way and let me code. OSX does this well, linux really does not.

4451500,comment,4448559,4450472,2,0,Variance,,,"If I may pitch in: since you're trying so hard to throw around opportunity cost, there are, believe it or not, a couple other important points to consider here.<p>The first is that all valuable things can be measured in terms of other valuable things--including dollars. Opportunity cost tradeoffs of all types can be mapped onto a tradeoff for some quantity of dollars. All things can therefore be measured in dollars, even if you want to be silly and peg the value of things like ""true love"" as infinite--that's equivalent to infinity <i>dollars</i>. Your time is measurable in money as well.<p>The second point follows from something either you or someone else noted before. Eventually, paying for things that aren't worth your times adds up, and you have to work more yourself. That's the point! If you can earn more in an hour at work than you would have ""earned"" by spending an hour painting your house, you make money at no additional expense of time or effort. Alternatively, you could make the same amount of money as you would have gained in house/aesthetic value from painting the house, but spend less time doing it since you are more efficient at work: a time savings. Now, it isn't easy to just ""work an extra hour"" and get paid for it, but if you make these decisions constantly and trade more time at your job for paying other people to do stuff that isn't worth your time, you'll amass enough saved time to increase your work schedule by a reasonable block.<p>The key to understanding all of this is that you want to say that the concept of opportunity cost extends beyond money, which it does in a sense--but in another, since all things can be measured in terms of all other things, all opportunity costs have equivalent dollar costs. And so knowing your personal per-hour opportunity cost in dollars is a great way to get a basic quantitative idea of what things are worth your time. If spending an hour with your family is worth more than the $33.74 an hour equivalent that you make at work, it doesn't mean that spending time with your family can't be quantified in terms of dollars; it means that it's worth more than an extra $33.74 but is otherwise <i>difficult</i> to quantify.<p>And curiously, let's say you reduce your working hours down to 30 a week, the bare minimum you can have to live modestly but comfortably, and spend all the extra time with your family since you love them so much. But why not reduce the hours to 29 a week? Losing that $33.74 every week would put you below the threshold that everyone is happy at. That means that now, $33.74 is worth <i>more</i> than spending the extra hour with your family. In essence, this example shows that the fact that people go to work <i>at all</i> demonstrates how dollar values can outweigh ""immeasurable"" things like sentimental values, and since they can outweigh, they can be compared, which means that sentimental values have a relative value to marginal dollar value increases or decreases. Therefore, sentimental values can be translated to dollar values. This is a specific case of the general principle noted before, that all things can be measured in dollars, and so it's no sin (and in fact quite handy) to use your dollar/hour opportunity cost liberally when making decisions on how to spend your time.",1346276514

Companies have no hesitation cutting short a day long interview process if by mid-morning the feedback to HR is that this is going to be a no-hire.

Analogy by anecdote:<p>I have always felt that an interview is a fair dialogue.  Back in 1997 (yes I am THAT old) I was interviewed for a tech support position near London, for a massive multinational which had a completely failing tech service desk catering to tens of thousands of desktops.  At the end of the interview the interviewer - who'd be my prospective boss - asked the question ""does that sound like something that appeals to you"" after describing the job.<p>My answer was honest: ""no not really, but I wish you all the best in the search.""<p>""Why not?""<p>""Well, I might have interest in leading a team like that because it sounds like there's a real problem to be solved in servicing your internal customers, but it doesn't sound like it's a process I'd enjoy working in, as it is"".<p>This being London in the late 90s where there was a massive IT shortage (a bit like Silicon Valley and engineers today) I got a call back from my agent (fancy name for recruiter) who asked what I'd done.  Apparently they'd called him back and offered me the job of running the Service Desk and fixing the problems that made me not interested in working on it.<p>I ended up with a much higher paying job offer, my first management experience (eventually building the team to over 40 people from the 6 I started with) and they ended up with someone who finally solved their problems, turning first line fix around from 17% to 70% in about six months.<p>Interviews aren't there for you to say yessir nosir.

So it is with Avatar -- when we watch Avatar, we're looking at math.<p>And much of nature is defined using math -- note that I said, not <i>described</i>, but <i>defined</i>. Here's an example -- there are species of locusts (cicadas, actually) that reproduce at 13-year and 17-year intervals. Until recently, no on knew why. It turns out that both 13 and 17 are prime numbers, and this ties into a survival strategy hatched by natural selection (quite by chance). All explained here:<p><a href=""http://arachnoid.com/prime_numbers/index.html#Mathematical_Locusts"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arachnoid.com/prime_numbers/index.html#Mathematical_L...</a><p>In other words, the locust survival strategy is math speaking out loud.<p>If you read a book in which a seashore is described, do you argue that the description isn't germane to the thing being described? If the writer isn't skilled, or the reader is lacking in the capacity for visualization, then that is perhaps a legitimate objection, but for most people, words convey meaning. So does math. Math is a language in much the same way that words are a language.<p>The distinction between ""loving math"" and ""loving things made of math"" is dubious at best. When P.A.M. Dirac wrote his now-famous equation that describes how relativistic electrons behave, he noticed that it had two solutions -- sort of like a quadratic equation.<p>At first he doubted that there could really be two kinds of matter, as his equation suggested. But within a few years antimatter was observed, and Dirac forever afterward wished he had been willing to take his own equation at face value and predict antimatter himself.<p>My point?

Union employees aren't about adding value, they're about protecting their own ass rather that striving to find ways to add value to the organization.<p>Business owners do not have an obligation to keep everyone employed, they have an obligation to make a profit, if there's no profit, then they won't be able to employ anyone for very long.<p>Good employees are an asset to any company.

Unions have made employees interchangeable because you get paid based on your job title and seniority, not necessarily the value you bring to the organization. The big tragedy is that in union shops, when layoffs happen it's the junior guys that go first, even if they're better workers than the more senior. It's disgusting that years on the job mean more than actual job output. Unions had their place before OSHA came along, but now they are corrupt labor monopolies where the bosses get paid millions each year cronyism and corruption are the norm. If you don't like a company, you're free to quit, but in closed-shop states, if you don't like the union, too bad, you have to be a member (or pay the dues) if you want to be employed in that field in your state.

All but the victim and the defendant.<p>A year later, the judge retired and published his memoir. A big surprise awaited. He had begun his career as an ACLU lawyer in the 60s but wound up with a tough reputation among the defense bar.<p>An even bigger surprise awaited me. He devoted a chapter to explaining how hopeless the jury system is. To illustrate, he told the story of a murder case. <i>My murder case</i>. I read, ""Never was a defendant more plainly guilty"". I agreed, with some relief, but was confused. Why this case?<p>Turns out my trial was the <i>second</i> trial. At the first, some of the female jurors refused to convict. The defendant was ""too good looking to have committed the crime"", in their opinion. Mistrial. Then I recalled how, in our later trial, two female jurors wanted to find a way to justify a manslaughter conviction for what was clearly deliberate murder.

The key is to make sure that we invest in cutting edge research that can take us to the next level - so even as we continue work with the international space station, we are focused on a potential mission to a asteroid as a prelude to a manned Mars flight.<p>------<p>[]FifthSurprise 762 points 50 minutes ago\nWhat was the most difficult decision that you had to make during this term?<p>[]PresidentObama[S] 158 points 20 minutes ago\nThe decision to surge our forces in afghanistan.

We need to start with passing the Disclose Act that is already written and been sponsored in Congress - to at least force disclosure of who is giving to who. We should also pass legislation prohibiting the bundling of campaign contributions from lobbyists.

On OS X reverting to a previously working kernel would have meant backing up all of my data, reinstalling the OS from the DVDs, installing the combo update to the last working version of the complete OS (10.6.6), restoring my data (but not using Time Machine) and then never allowing another OS upgrade, including not updating the apps that come with the OS.<p>On Linux it would have been a matter of downloading the previous kernel package and installing it.  That's it.  The package managers are usually smart enough to figure out that you've forced a previous version of the package and won't replace it in future updates.<p>Neither solution would have been doable for a novice, but the Linux solution is <i>far</i> easier for an expert and a generally more palatable solution.

The big advantage I have is that I live above the store - so I have no commute! So we make sure that when I'm in DC I never miss dinner with them at 6:30 pm - even if I have to go back down to the Oval for work later in the evening. I do work out every morning as well, and try to get a basketball or golf game in on the weekends just to get out of the bubble. Speaking of balance, though, I need to get going so I'm back in DC in time for dinner. But I want to thank everybody at reddit for participating - this is an example of how technology and the internet can empower the sorts of conversations that strengthen our democracy over the long run. AND REMEMBER TO VOTE IN NOVEMBER - if you need to know how to register, go to Gottaregister.com. By the way, if you want to know what I think about this whole reddit experience - NOT BAD!\npermalinkcontextfull commentsI am Barack Obama, President of the United States -- AMA by PresidentObamain IAmA<p>[+]PresidentObama[S] 21 points22 points23 points 10 minutes ago  (0 children)\n[]PresidentObama[S] 21 points22 points23 points 10 minutes ago<p>I understand how tough it is out there for recent grads. You're right - your long term prospects are great, but that doesn't help in the short term. Obviously some of the steps we have taken already help young people at the start of their careers. Because of the health care bill, you can stay on your parent's plan until you're twenty six. Because of our student loan bill, we are lowering the debt burdens that young people have to carry. But the key for your future, and all our futures, is an economy that is growing and creating solid middle class jobs - and that's why the choice in this election is so important. The other party has two ideas for growth - more taxs cuts for the wealthy (paid for by raising tax burdens on the middle class and gutting investments like education) and getting rid of regulations we've put in place to control the excesses on wall street and help consumers. These ideas have been tried, they didnt work, and will make the economy worse. I want to keep promoting advanced manufacturing that will bring jobs back to America, promote all-American energy sources (including wind and solar), keep investing in education and make college more affordable, rebuild our infrastructure, invest in science, and reduce our deficit in a balanced way with prudent spending cuts and higher taxes on folks making more than $250,000/year. I don't promise that this will solve all our immediate economic challenges, but my plans will lay the foundation for long term growth for your generation, and for generations to follow. So don't be discouraged - we didn't get into this fix overnight, and we won't get out overnight, but we are making progress and with your help will make more.\npermalinkcontextfull commentsI am Barack Obama, President of the United States -- AMA by PresidentObamain IAmA<p>[+]PresidentObama[S] 631 points632 points633 points 24 minutes ago  (0 children)\n[]PresidentObama[S] 631 points632 points633 points 24 minutes ago<p>It will be out soon!

We need to start with passing the Disclose Act that is already written and been sponsored in Congress - to at least force disclosure of who is giving to who. We should also pass legislation prohibiting the bundling of campaign contributions from lobbyists. Over the longer term, I think we need to seriously consider mobilizing a constitutional amendment process to overturn Citizens United (assuming the Supreme Court doesn't revisit it). Even if the amendment process falls short, it can shine a spotlight of the super-PAC phenomenon and help apply pressure for change.\npermalinkcontextfull commentsI am Barack Obama, President of the United States -- AMA by PresidentObamain IAmA<p>[+]PresidentObama[S] 557 points558 points559 points 31 minutes ago  (0 children)\n[]PresidentObama[S] 557 points558 points559 points 31 minutes ago<p>The decision to surge our forces in afghanistan. Any time you send our brave men and women into battle, you know that not everyone will come home safely, and that necessarily weighs heavily on you. The decision did help us blunt the taliban's momentum, and is allowing us to transition to afghan lead - so we will have recovered that surge at the end of this month, and will end the war at the end of 2014.

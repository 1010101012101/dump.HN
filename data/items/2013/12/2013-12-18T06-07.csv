Are these bugs antibiotic resistant just to current antibiotics? Is the only reason we have nothing that currently kills them is because it&#x27;s not profitable for research into fighting them? Basically, what I&#x27;d love to know is are we on the cusp of a new Black Plague type of scenario with antibiotic resistant bugs or is it simply a problem that we haven&#x27;t been working on?<p>I read somewhere a while back that no one has really been focusing on new forms of antibiotics because the old ones worked, and it&#x27;s not profitable for pharmaceuticals to research it, as it&#x27;s the type of drug a person takes for a limited time only (aka non-chronic) so the profit potential is much lower than say AIDS medication.

962041,comment,961838,962013,0,0,netcan,,,"If you owned a 'hot' company in the bubble & decided to 'make something a bit more lasting,' you probably went bust. Those that got out, won.<p>If you think that the market is too hot, what you are saying is that startups are overvalued. If you hold an asset you believe is overvalued, you should sell it. Holding overvalued assets because they wil be even more overvalued later is bubble talking.<p>BTW, I'm not saying there is a bubble. Just reacting to the commentator's POV.",1259193246
962040,comment,961838,962013,0,0,vaksel,,,"the problem is that you don't know if it will last. In fact, you are almost guaranteed to be deadpooled. Whether by getting crushed by a bigger opponent(the company offering a buy out has money to burn, if they don't buy you, they'll buy your competitor) or by a savvy startup which gets lucky.<p>Where is Lycos? Where is Altavista? Where is Friendster? When you can't take a step without stumbling over a corpse of a rotting startup, gambling it all away in hopes that you are an exception just seems silly.<p>It's better to sell out early, secure your future, then once you can risk it all without ending up in a poor house, you can go all the way with your second startup.",1259193164

962035,comment,961926,961965,0,0,ionfish,,,"> Should it be ""will probably not view the product...""?<p>I don't think so; the idea that the author is attempting to convey is that people who haven't spent a lot of time working on the parts of a business that aren't building the product won't realise how important those other things are. Admittedly it could have been explained a lot more clearlyâ€”I had to go back and read that sentence over too.",1259192920

SHA-256 seems to me to meet that assumption.<p>I decide whether I want heads or tails, and create a file that starts with my choice, then has random padding.  I compute the hash and send it to you.<p>You now tell me openly your call.  I believe you have no way to compute from my hash what I've chosen, so to you, my choice is hidden.  Whether you guess right is effectively random.<p>Now I reveal the file from which the hash was computed.  Again, I can't compute a different file with the same hash, so I'm forced to reveal the choice I made.  If you were right we both know it.  If you were wrong we both know it.<p>Can you explain how it's possible for either of us to cheat?<p>I appreciate your time - thanks.",1259191941

Enterprise applications are a good, because it's not uncommon to get commitments from buyers before the product exists.

962008,comment,961913,961913,0,0,richardburton,,,"I found that it took me a while to <i>get</i> twitter. None of my non-tech friends are interested because there is no instant gratification for them. They aren't interested in following celebrities or finding out about the latest news-links (two examples of ways you can benefit pretty quickly from Twitter, I guess). They're not motivated to build up a following because they've spent a lot of time friending on Facebook and don't want to do that again because ""facebook statuses are the same"". They're not interested in keeping up to date with people they don't know because they already spend enough time keeping up with the people they do.<p>For me the addiction to Twitter has come from the number of times serendipity has occured. I followed a developer who tweeted about a conference where I met a bunch of cool developers who I followed. They all tweeted about cool stuff they're working on and through them I've met lots of other great guys and have been able to build some great apps with some of them. One tweet started all that.

961998,comment,961591,961591,0,0,richardburton,,,"I was speaking to a guy today who has a really interesting idea for a project management tool (yes, another one!). Even though I've tried every tool under the sun I still thought that his concept sounded awesome. The way he intends to combine some of the best concepts out there with his own experience in the project-management space will definitely give him a unique product. Just one solid USP is all he really needs to differentiate. He won't beat all his competitors with lots of ticks in a classic competition matrix. What he will do is scratch an itch that he's had for 6 years and hopefully be able to get all the people he's met during that time (who have the same itch) to use his app to scratch it.<p>The phrase: ""it's been done"" Makes me shudder.

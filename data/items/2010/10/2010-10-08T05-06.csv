If an update automagically installs itself and restarts your machine because you went to the kitchen to make yourself a tea and a sandwich and you lose work, that's one thing. Same if an update forces you to wait for it to download and install when you really need to get some work done. Bonus negative points if you are on a connection where you pay by the kilobyte with international roaming. If an update asks for consent, installs cleanly without breaking things or making your machine unusable for the time, and does not destroy your work if you aren't paying attention, that's another thing. There's a good reason people dislike updates. The correct thing to do is fix them, not advocate them.",1286517087

It thoroughly studies ad hoc synchronization from many real world applications and concludes that ad hoc synchronizations cause all kinds of problems, including bugs, performance issues and misleading concurrency bug detection tools. It also finds that ad hoc synchronizations are implemented in many various ways, thus very hard to be recognized. Because of this, the authors developed a tool, called SyncFinder, that automatically annotates ad hoc synchronizations in source code.<p>The full paper can be downloaded from http://www.usenix.org/events/osdi10/tech/full_papers/Xiong.pdf. It's from the Opera Research Group at UCSD (http://opera.ucsd.edu/).<p>Should we stop using ad hoc synchronization? Do we need better synchronization libraries?

It's been lamented at great length in numerous studies and publications.  It's a natural consequence of the other choices our societies are making, becoming more mobile in both work and home.  People move more than they did, they change jobs more than they did, and thus they change social circles more than they did.<p>Social Networks compensate for all that.   They do in fact bring people closer together than they would be otherwise.  Certainly much of the interaction appears superficial, but if you think that indicates it's meaningless, that's because you don't understand social interaction.    Even casual, seemingly superficial interactions bring us closer.  They help us define our communities.<p>On Facebook I'm friends with people I haven't seen in 20+ years.  Yes, most of our interactions seem superficial.  But they aren't just that, they're tying us all closer to where we came from.  And sometime it's more than that.  That friend of yours from high school struggling with cancer?  It means something to them that 50 people post well wishes weekly.  It helps them.  It's meaningful.<p>I lost track of many people in my life, without really meaning to.  It's just how things work.  Facebook et al help me correct that.  They keep me in touch.

The DB has settings like the default character set, table types etc.  These have to be kept in sync across all instances, dev, stage, and prod.

Add a noSQL server, message bus, file storage, email, etc and you can see how it becomes a serious issue.  And the problem grows exponentially the more developers there are each with one or more dev instances which have to get the latest changes and be kept up to date.<p>These things all have to be dealt with and should not be thrown over the wall and ""let the sysadmin deal with it.""

Amazing that they got $80 mil in funding in the past 2 year, 15 years after it started... Also unclear why they need it, if you've got $60 mil in revenues, 400 employees, and not a lot of non-employee costs, then why do you need an additional $80 million in investment?",1286514699

Specifically, I can say that tags are only seen by me, which would effectively turn off tagging.  Can I do this with groups?  I've tried, but can't seem to find it anywhere in the settings.  If anyone knows, please share, I'm very interested in turning it off.",1286514645

Folding your arms or keeping your legs tightly together lets your reptile brain feel nicely protected when you're anxious.<p>Instead, widen your stance as you sit. Spread your legs a bit, arch your arms behind your head and lean your head into them, if it feels natural enough. Those in control take up more space.<p>It forces you to calm down and projects a more confident image. There was even an article on HN about this a few weeks ago, I think from HBS.<p>When I make a conscious effort to do these things, I've found that conversations like interviews are a lot more enjoyable, so I do better even in uncertain territory.<p>Good luck!",1286514570

Updates are an important part of the sotfware lifecycle. It's no big deal that sometimes the updater might need to be updated.<p>I personally get a bit angry when of all people, software engineers get annoyed about updates. You should know better that the update to software would push better algorithms, reducing CPU and memory usage while it might also have security fixes making software more secure.<p>Nobody (not even Apple) makes perfect software. There is no such thing as bug free code. Updates fix bugs.<p>I understand it is a bit psychological too, since people complain more about free updates than paid ones.<p>Engineers should promote updates amongst friends and family and not deride updates in public.",1286514521

Whilst the creator may have just created the site because it sounded like a ""fun"" idea the value of the website is with the micro community that thrives.<p>Heck, I'll even go as far as saying Dailybooth has helped to save lives. It's dedicated users consists of a subsection of society that may be outcasted in real life. Lets take a teenager who lives in a small town, whom may feel more accepted in a city but has no similar peers within a small town. Dailybooth facilitates this teenager to connect and belong to like-minded individuals people whom they have never met before. Over time real friendships are created over a shared connection which is the website and community.<p>I heard of actual stories where a teen attempted to commit suicide due to being perceived as an outcast. In this case Dailybooth has facilitated friendships and connections with similar peers which in turn reduces the feeling of being outcasted in a small town, thus indirectly reducing the chances of suicide.<p>There are even a number of Dailybooth users who travel across different countries to facilitate in real friendships and connections. It allows for boundaries of prejudice to be broken.<p>So Dailybooth may not be solving a direct problem. But does it have value in our society? I would argue is certainly does.<p>(I have researched extensively into the userbase and mechanics of Dailybooth and have been involved in it's community)",1286514346

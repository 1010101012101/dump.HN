Everyone says people need to get more exercise, and many people spend hours at the gym when they could just combine their workout and commute.<p>OK, so it's not so great to show up to work smelly.

Yes, <i>those</i> people do, because there are enough offsetting positive factors for these folks that CA is still a reasonable deal for them compared to the alternatives.<p>There are also plenty of smart and wealthy folks who live in Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, and Florida, in part, because the taxes are lower.  As with any marginal change to a policy, you have to look at the effect on the marginal cases.  You have to ask, ""if taxes in CA were reduced by X%, what Y% more smart and wealthy people would choose to live there?""  I guarantee Y > 0 for any X > 0.",1240941543

Are you on one of your school's sport team? Are you part of any clubs? Did you try to take on some kind of leadership position at your school? How big is your friend circle?""<p>High school still offers many, many challenges, even if you don't realize it; for me, working on the school newspaper and joining the book club made a tremendous difference in how I perceived much of life.<p>""I was just wondering if you guys had any experiences or suggestions to share about school.""<p>School is a game. Make it your mission to learn how to crack the game, which doesn't mean you have to neglect your ""real"" education, as it sounds like that will happen chiefly on your own time. And what you consider ""wastes of time"" aren't always: they're opportunities to network, or to learn how to flirt, or to learn how to get away with things, and so on and so forth. These are important skills too, but many nerds ignore them for too long.<p>A final book recommendation: try Curtis Sittenfeld's novel ""Prep.""

The purpose of the experiment is to gather information, without doing any more programming.  First explain to your players that you're going to run an experiment: you're looking for ways for the site to be self-supporting so it can continue to grow and meet the needs of its players.  The experiment isn't going to affect game play, and that it's just an experiment: you'll take it down if it doesn't work out.<p>Every business faces the issue price differentiation between customers: some customers have little money and some have a lot, so how do you get the customers with money to pay more without turning away the customers who have little (or, in your case, no money).<p>For the experiment add a tiered membership: free (what you have now) and patron ($5/month).  Both are identical in terms of gameplay (both for fairness and so you don't have to do any programming).  By becoming a patron a member has their name listed on the homepage as a patron of Particracy (which is literally true).  During new user sign up prominently display the patron option ""you can become a patron for $5/month, or join for free"".  On the homepage above the patron list have a button ""Join the Patrons of Particracy"".<p>If anyone signs up, that tells you that there are people eager enough the support the game that they'll give you money even though they don't get any tangible extra features.<p>Next you might try running a Google ads campaign, max $5 total and max $0.05 per click, using a keyword of ""political simulation game"".  This will deliver 100 people to your landing page.  Track how many of the 100 become users (if any) and how many become patrons (if any).  This will tell you how easy it will be to draw in new users when you have a way to make money.<p>Now you look at your conversion rate (is it 0%? 5%? 1%?) and get a sense of what it would take to get to $200/month (40 paying customers).  For example, if your conversion rate is 1% then you'd need 4,000 customers to get the 40 paying ones.  Then you can look at a) if you want to go for that, or b) do you think that doing things like more programming and adding the premium service you're thinking about might get the conversion rate up.<p>The point of the experiment isn't for it to make money by itself (though of course it will be nice if it did :), it is to gather information and to give you encouragement.",1240940521

I've been through exactly what you're going through, and <i>it's not selfish in any way</i>. You want to achieve your potential (which in the longer run, would help the world in some way), and high school is proving a hindrance to you.<p>Many of the other commenters don't seem to understand your issue (assuming I do). Yes, you can socialize a lot in high school and participate in other things. Most of these 'other things' turn out to be as fake as the 'education' the school provides. But that's even not the issue here. I would bet that, even with a lot of 'socializing', unless you lose your core thirst to learn (which would definitely be a bad thing), you would be left with an empty feeling and a bitter taste at the end of the day.<p>And no, ""real life is boring too"" is no more true that you make it to be. Most adults stick to the 'system' (just like most students don't think of how much high school is wasting their time and stick to it) and do not pursue what they truly enjoy. When your actual job (and its purpose) is something you truly enjoy, these 'mundane' tasks of dealing with accountants and such would not appear big to you at all - they'll just happen.<p>I felt the exact same way as you do in college (which is not very different from school where I live), and coped with it with some tactics. The first one was what charlesju's comment says: \n""When I was in High School I used to pass the time by programming on my graphing calculator. I'm sure these days you can get by with reading a book in class or maybe even a small netbook. If none of those things are possible, just start a project and doodle your algorithms while you're in class and code them up at night.\nThere are a lot of ways to circumvent the system and do something you like to do, don't just give in to your immediate urges to shut it out. At the very least, you should graduate High School.""\n  (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=583462"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=583462</a>)<p>Some other comments here that I think would be useful to you:<p>""Treat high school as an experience, not as a place to go to learn- you've mastered the learning part (at least you better by getting rockstar grades), make a good effort to master the rest."" - unexpected<p>""Stick with it, for now. It's not so much that it's a very valuable experience, it's that without it you will be locked out of so many other things that really are worthwhile. I know that two more years feels like an eternity right now, but trust me, it's not."" - felixc    \nAnd a word of caution here, see if applies to you: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=583453"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=583453</a>  - tracy<p>Finally, whatever you do, get rid of this 'guilt' that you are doing something wrong. I myself was affected a lot by it, until at the end when we interviewed for jobs, I saw clearly that those who had gone with the system mostly failed, but those of us who tried to break out and learn ourselves faired exceedingly well. So be aware that you are part of an elite group and would be very welcome at the real world.<p>Unfortunately, many of the comments here too seem to reinforce that you are simply being immature, but your comment indicates to me you are not. In that case, be clear about this: some of us just can't bring ourselves to go along with the 'system'. Once you've seen how mind numbingly foolish it is, it is very difficult to stay there (I'm reminded of the film The Matrix). So, there's nothing <i>wrong</i> about that being difficult for you.<p>But realise that this difficulty is something you have to overcome. Simply dropping out will complicate many other things in life, so I would not recommend it. Instead, understand yourself, and find ways to work around the system and make it palatable to you. If you forget about what the classes are actually supposed to teach and instead think deeply about what is being taught, you'll find that every moment can teach you a lot. Same goes for any work you're assigned - simply overperform (according to your standards - the school may not consider it excellent performance, but you know to ignore it). Research deeply about any assignment you're given, and if you're unable to do that (due to say lack of time), brainstorm yourself while writing down (or typing out) about the concept there. If you do this sincerely, you'll find that you enjoy the process, while excellent grades come your way without even all the 'hard work' the 'sincere' students put in.<p>To summarize the idea - you're interested in learning a lot, so <i>use</i> the things you do at school to do it; when you do the school work with concentration and dedication, you'll find that you've learnt a lot more than the teacher meant you to, while enjoying every moment of it.",1240940456

I'm a 4th year in college right now and it'll take me 5 to graduate. I've always been in the top half of my classes and wondered why we had to learn so much useless crap. I talked to my 8th grade humanities teacher about this and he told me that ""The system's not perfect. Work through the system first, then change it after you're out of it if it bothers you that much."" I'm not suggesting you try to reform the education system, but this was some good advice for me, and I hope it helps you.<p>Coincidentally, my girlfriend is just graduating college from learning to a be a grade school teacher. She's taught me something very important over the last year or so: that school is not really about learning the subjects your teachers are trying to teach you, it's about you developing as a person. Maybe it would help if you thought of high school as a social learning environment rather than an academic one. Let me also say that in no way do I mean that just because you're in 10th grade does that mean that you're not mature or intelligent. Everyone can improve themselves in many ways, not just academically, and that's what I suggest you focus on in school.<p>You're going to have boring tasks to do when you have a job, or when you live on your own, so it's best to learn how to get through them now and appreciate the genuinely interesting subjects while you can. I have had about a 50/50 split with good/bad professors in college and I'm assuming that this carries over into the professional world. You'll probably have some co-workers who are like you, and care about doing well, and some that just do it for the money.<p>You're way ahead of me as far as figuring these things out; I didn't start programming until the middle of my 3rd year in college. I also didn't read PG's high school essay until very recently, and I wish I had read it when I was your age. At the last career fair I went to, all three of the recuiters I talked to told me they wanted candidates with programming experience outside of class. You're well ahead of the curve and it sounds like you've got a good head on your shoulders.

583539,comment,583213,583213,0,0,rarrrrrr,,,"This is why SpiderOak (and I suspect Tarsnap, and probably others) use a completely different approach to storing historical versions that don't explicitly involve deltas.<p>Instead, they chunk files and store individual data blocks, and use an adaptation of the rsync algorithm to be able to tell exactly which bytes have changed from one version to the next.  Any segments of changed bytes are stored as new data blocks.  This has two big advantages: 1) any version can be restored by retrieving exactly the set of data blocks that compose it and 2) any version in the chain can be purged, and use a sort of garbage collection to determine which blocks can then be removed.<p>The adaptation of the rsync algorithm has to be able to work with an arbitrary number of data block sizes  (normal rsync has a max of 2 sizes -- one uniform size for all blocks except the last block, and size of the tailing block.)  This can make it very slow if not handled smartly.<p>Another option the author might consider when making the delta chain is to compress the versions first with zlib using the --rsyncable option, and then make the deltas between the compressed versions.  Normally compression means that two very similar uncompressed files will have very different compressed output, because even small changes cascade through the rest of the stream.  --rsyncable fixes that, and adds about 1% to the compressed size.",1240938661

583525,comment,583159,583265,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"I recommend this highly. I felt more or less as you (the original submitter) do until the math club found me [1] at the end of freshman year. My freshman year is like a giant beige blur in my memory. It's like I was in a vaguely depressed stasis the whole time. But then it was math, trivia, and Drama Club stage crew for the rest of my high school career. Suddenly high school felt great.<p>There's nothing wrong with being an introvert... but there are degrees of introversion. And self-study is the secret to learning, which you seem to understand, but you might be surprised to find that you self-study better when you've got a team, a goal, a project, or a group. If the groups at your school seem to suck, there are other ones around. You've even got the Internet, which I didn't have at your age.<p>Here's one regret from my high school days: At one point someone came up to me and said ""You're a big guy and you're not already on the football team or any other team. Want to learn to play the tuba and march in the band? We need more tuba!"" At that point I was a very shy freshman, easily embarrassed, with no musical experience, and that whole idea sounded preposterous, like some kind of practical joke. So I said no. I wish I hadn't done that. It turns out that they were probably serious. And playing the tuba is probably pretty easy! I might have faked it pretty well with just four notes and a basic sense of rhythm! And it might have been fun to march around with the band... a nice, structured group activity with a lot of depth. (There is always a more complicated piece of marching-band music out there...) And I'd be have been that much farther ahead on learning something about music.<p>Hang in there. Don't drop out of high school if you can possibly help it -- it's good to have the degree, and believe me it will end. And college is a big improvement!<p>---<p>[1] They pulled me and a few others out of freshman algebra class and just gave us the AHSME, one day. I had no idea what the AHSME was, but I took it, and I ended up in a three-way tie for first place in my high school with my best friend (another freshman) and a senior member of the math club. I learned about the math club the next day when its faculty adviser came stalking into the cafeteria during lunch, waving the AHSME results in one hand, with the wild-eyed look of a prophet on a mission. He approached me and my friend and more-or-less told us that we <i>had</i> to join the math club, it was <i>vitally important</i>, because we <i>had the knack</i>.<p>That guy was great. Teaching is a weird business. 99% of the time you are saying the same things that you always say, but the remaining 1% are tiny moments which change people's lives forever.",1240938339

At the end of the day it's still 2 of us, that's a troubling sign.  I'm a pretty motivating person, and the fact no one else has really shown interest in helping out or getting involved is scary.  <p>c)  I'm not overly familiar with how to run an enterprise/business software company.  I've done consumer tech, this isn't my first venture, and I know enough (and yet have a shitload to learn).  Consumer web companies seem much more straight forward to me. Business web apps are a different beast to launch.  <p>d) this isn't a question of lack of traction, is it a good company, good product, etc. maybe this is the scary part: the product is awesome, the market were going after is a good one, and there's a lot of opportunity. the problem lies more with the co-founder and the overall energy/excitement of the company.<p>So my question is:<p>a) Do I bail out and start something else/ join something else that is in its really early stages?<p>b) Is there a way to get motivated again/fix these problems? <p>Many thanks in advance.",1223328798

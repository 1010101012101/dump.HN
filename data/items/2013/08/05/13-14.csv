The best/only real indicator we give users that a site is supposedly secure is an HTTPS indicator, possibly with a basically meaningless EV indicator. In reality those are no indication that the site itself is safe.<p>So what if browsers supported an HTML Secure Mode subset which disallowed any JavaScript, iframes and other potentially problematic behaviors (such as form submissions to different domains, etc.) This would work like JavaScript strict, where the page itself would indicate it is made to this specification and the browser should hold it to it and throw errors/not display otherwise.<p>This could be used for sites where security is more important than bells and whistles. Like banking websites, government websites like electronic voting, etc.<p>Granted this is not a perfect solution, and it doesn&#x27;t guarantee that the server side is any better, but it at least might be a step in the right direction. If browsers supported it and we made sites to the specification, it could give indication to users that there&#x27;s a large swath of potential exploits that are not possible.<p>Does this idea have any potential or am I just thinking about this too early in the day?<p>EDIT: I realize that graceful failing is a key tenant of the web, so maybe it would just fail like HTTPS does and indicate to the user &quot;This site said it was secure but it isn&#x27;t.&quot; If it passes Safe Mode validation then it gets some kind of special, really obvious to the user indicator.<p>The idea here is to make a mode where a) you can be sure everything on the page is coming from the site you thought you were talking to and thus b) that the server itself would have to be compromised for the page to be compromised.<p>This mode could also have additional effects like indicating when a link on the page would take you away from this site, etc.",1375710615

This means that for a program X, you can consider the set of all source codes (of equal size) which generate a program with equivalent behavior to X. The obfuscater can be used to draw a function from this set, without revealing anything about the original source code.\nAs the research paper mentions, although this meets the technical definition of best possible obfuscation, it is not necessarily good obfuscation. For example, if the obfuscater generates the most human-readable version of the input, then it would still qualify, as it reveals nothing about the original source.<p>The bigger problem with using this encrypt software is that software is over specified. Every external call your system makes, whether or not it <i>actually</i> does anything, is still considered part of the behavior of the program, and would therefore leak information about the structure of your program.<p>While this is defiantly much stronger than many previous obfuscation techniques, in order for it to be most effective you would need to very strongly keep all side-effect generating code separate as isolated as possible.<p>EDIT: From the paper: &quot;Now that we have constructed an indistinguishability obfuscator, we are faced with the question: what good\nis an indistinguishability obfuscator? The definition of indistinguishability obfuscation does not make clear\nwhat, if anything, an indistinguishability obfuscator actually hides about a circuit. In particular, if the\ncircuit being obfuscated was already in an obvious canonical form, then we know that the indistinguisha-\nbility obfuscator would not need to hide anything...we will use indistinguishability obfuscation\nby constructing circuits that inherently have multiple equivalent forms&quot;<p>Also, the application to software obfuscation is largely an afterthought in the paper. And I don&#x27;t see any analysis of the efficiency of software generated by this, so my guess would be that this is infeasible to use for obfuscation.",1375710556

6159947,comment,6158244,6159892,3,0,MrFoof,,,"Well, the reason is because auto manufacturers are notorious for chasing volume, and still are.<p>For example, although they&#x27;re not a luxury marque, VW specifically (not the VW group) decontented their cars in what is referred to as the &quot;beigekrieg&quot;.  By decontenting -- and then drastically lowering the price -- of the Jetta and Passat, they are gaining significant volume to meet the goal of increasing U.S. unit sales from 250,000 a year to 800,000 a year.  So far they&#x27;ve managed to increase it to > 400,000 a year.<p>Why is Audi bringing over the A3, BMW the 1 series (though that&#x27;s not gone terribly well) and FWD cars, and Mercedes the FWD CLA?  These are cars at lower price points, meant to increase volume and to get new customers into the fold of the brand.  On the entry-level luxury market, buyers are price sensitive.  Not as price sensitive as the mainstream compact and mid-size sedan markets (who have been decontenting cars to keep prices from moving), but still price sensitive.  If the cars get too expensive, or if times get tough, these buyers abandon their plans first.  Regardless, all three marques are seeing record sales in the U.S.<p>Even Porsche, one of the most profit-oriented marques on the planet, has the sub-Cayenne crossover being launched at the L.A. auto show.  It may break the &quot;we make at least $10K on every car we sell&quot; informal rule for the first time in over a decade.  Why?  Volume, which admittedly, allows it to fund other versions (and entirely different) of existing sports cars which bring in very high margin.<p>The only manufacturer I can think of that&#x27;s genuinely attempting to be exclusive is Ferrari, who is now trying to limit global sales to 7,000 vehicles per year, which will raise prices.<p>-----<p>Regardless, I think Tesla&#x27;s strategy is the correct one.

Also, FHE is <i>very</i> slow nowadays, AFAIK there are no actual deployments of that concept, because of the prohibitive slowness (e.g. a single AES encryption taking days).<p>4. &quot;Using indistinguishability obfuscator for polynomial-size circuits, together with injective one-way functions, public-key encryption, and a novel variant of Sahais simulation-sound non-interactive zero knowledge [Sah99] proofs, we show how to obtain functional encryption schemes supporting all polynomial-size circuits.&quot;<p>This is awesome and sounds like it <i>can</i> obfuscate malware or be used to make actual DRM, but again, the indistinguishability obfuscator is likely so slow as to not be practical these days. Maybe in a few decades?<p>Obviously I&#x27;m not writing this to take anything away from this huge theoretical result - just saying this is likely not what other commenters think it is.

This is a 'fire and forget' way of open sourcing something.<p>Takes 10 seconds and the effect is much the same, you get the source, what else could you ask for ? Nicer wrapping paper ?",1258189068

He took the name from a famous ""stick up"" kid in NY from the past. He made an album on Columbia before he met Em but was dropped when he was shot.",1258188939
941573,comment,940689,940689,0,0,jsz0,,,"If Apple has no intentions of changing the App Store model and will retain control indefinitely I think they need to monazite the App Store approval process to prioritize their resource and weed out some of the frivolous apps that clog up the que. There should be an option for a full level of support including an account manager who can intermediate disputes and work with developers throughout the whole process closely on approval issues and future maintenance releases. It would be good to offer a lower tier of support for indie/hobby developers for a much smaller premium. Something on a per app basis that would allow them to cut ahead of the pack.",1258188906
941572,comment,941507,941507,0,0,jacquesm,,,"On topic: I find it funny that someone of Bram Cohens' standing would miss the point of fast compilation.<p>If you're working in plenty of other languages compile time does not go up linear with code size, but much faster.<p>When you start out it zips right along, but as soon as you cross that 10,000 line mark the first bits of irritation set it in, and not much later than that you can go and get a cup of coffee and drink it while your code rebuilds. For really large projects an hour isn't much at all!<p>Fast compile time = I won't lose my train of thought while waiting for the compiler to finish. It's a 'tool' thing, and I think that such details make for much better tools.",1258188776

Everything else is cool / live-withable.",1258188438

941565,comment,941191,941363,0,0,freshfey,,,"I believe what he meant by ""completely self-reliant"" was more like ""a work for your own dreams and ideas"". Don't just work because you have to (of course everybody has to work, but 80-90% could also be entrepreneurs and wouldn't have to work for others and their dreams) for other people. And don't expect other people to always help you pursuing YOUR dreams.<p>Curtis Jackson was always self-reliant because he comes from a broken family (mother shot dead when he was 8, grandmother and grandfather had to take care of their own kids -> less attention on him -> more self-reliance and self-belief to actually make something of himself). If he expected to get help from other people or trust other people with his ideas and his dreams even with his work, his life would have been crushed badly. A natural self-belief is very important and should be carried by anyone trying to achieve big things.",1258186987

941562,comment,941504,941504,0,0,jacquesm,,,"Competence is not a constant. Even if today you may not be as skilled as your potential indicates you could be there is a simple way to change that:<p>Do stuff! And learn while you're doing it. Spend time reading and really absorbing and integrating the stuff you read until it makes sense, then apply that knowledge, repeatedly.<p>Nobody was born competent.<p>So use your abilities as they are today as a starting point and build them up from there, and don't worry too much about where you are on the scale, as long as you keep moving up you'll be fine.<p>Interaction with other people (here on HN there are some pretty smart people and they're not at all scared to share their knowledge) can accelerate that process, both because you can learn from others and because you can test your knowledge.<p>The fact that you're posting this here would indicate that you already got that last point :)",1258186659

941558,comment,940689,941509,0,0,CamperBob,,,"As far as I know, Apple has yet to sue anyone for jailbreaking an iPhone, or for publishing information on how to do so.  So it's not correct to say you don't have a choice of distribution channels.<p>I'm mostly playing devil's advocate here, because I agree that as long as a device is marketed as a general-purpose computing platform, it needs to be open to succeed in the long term.  Still, Apple is under no obligation to distribute anything and everything that people throw at them.",1258186194

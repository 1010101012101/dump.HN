9517992,comment,9517707,9517707,0,0,kwantam,,,"I wonder if they used the &quot;Texas Crutch,&quot; i.e., wrapped the brisket in foil after ~4 hours.<p>The upshot of the Texas Crutch technique is: after about 2 hours on the smoke, the internal temperature of a brisket will plateau for 6-8 hours before climbing toward its final temperature. According to experiments by Greg Blonder[0], this stall is caused by evaporative cooling: once the internal temperature reaches a point where the energy lost to evaporation balances the energy gained from the (low---225-250 Fahrenheit is the &quot;right&quot; temperature for a brisket) ambient temperature, the internal temp of the meat will stay put until sufficient water has evaporated.<p>Some call this cheating, but in my experimentation the &quot;crutch&quot; produces significantly tastier results because of the difference in juiciness. As additional evidence here, I&#x27;ll note that <i>every</i> BBQ place in Austin whose brisket is good to great---Franklin, La Barbecue, John Mueller Meat Co., and even Rudy&#x27;s---wraps their briskets in foil. (Edited to add: I didn&#x27;t mention Black&#x27;s and Kreutz&#x27;s because I&#x27;m not 100% sure that they do, but I vaguely recall that they do.)<p>One worry might be that the meat doesn&#x27;t absorb as much smoke after the foil is applied, and this is indeed true. One can trade off additional time in the smoke for more evaporation. After about 4 hours, the meat isn&#x27;t going to absorb much more flavor from the smoke, so that&#x27;s a great time to wrap it.<p>In fact, at that point you may as well make your life easier by transferring the meat to an oven (ideally, a convection oven to avoid hot spots) and finishing it off. It may feel wrong, but in my experience the results are superb.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.genuineideas.com/ArticlesIndex/stallbbq.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.genuineideas.com/ArticlesIndex/stallbbq.html</a>",1431212203

9517978,comment,9516005,9517506,0,0,reipahb,,,"Actually, deleted orders are not a problem with continuation tokens. The deleted order is only an issue if you use traditional paging requests, which was the point of the article.<p>The only case I can currently think of that cannot be solved using continuation tokens sent to the client is where the order of the items that are enumerated may change between calls to the API. For example, imagine that you are fetching items sorted by score, and somebody upvotes or downvotes an item while you are enumerating them. In that case it is very difficult to encode enough information in the continuation token. (I can think of complicated ways to make it work, but the resulting database queries would be horrible.)<p>But for simple stuff like deleted items and similar, it is easy. If you leave out sorting it is trivial to implement as well -- all you need is to enumerate the items based on an internal ID that is guaranteed to always increase, filtering them as required. The continuation token will simply be the ID of the last item you evaluated and the filter that is applied. On the next request you just resume from that ID. If that item ID happens to be deleted in the meantime it is no problem. You just resume from the next one available. I.e.:<p><pre><code>  SELECT * FROM items WHERE id > :last_returned_id AND [insert-filter-here] ORDER BY id LIMIT 100;</code></pre>",1431211706

In fact, one of the simplest register allocators you can use in an expression code generator is a stack; pop to allocate, push to deallocate, and spill if you run out. On a CPU, this will have benefits, but in a VM, it&#x27;s just a relabeling scheme for the same memory slots a stack VM would use.<p>What you potentially gain with a register VM is reduced accounting overhead; a stack machine will be constantly adjusting the stack pointer on every operation.

My beef is that it is an unrealistic constraint that the same price setting algorithm will be used by all companies. And it is possible for someone to enter the market using a different algorithm.<p>MR!=MC in the real world, but the classic micoecon explanation for this is monopolistic competition. I&#x27;m not sure why there is a need to say that all of economics is wrong. Are there commodities markets with open entry and no open collusion where MR!=MC? (Where marginal cost is defined as the cost of bringing on a new production line, not just producing one more unit).<p>Non-commodity markets get quite complicated. Often the market bifurcates into a set of premium brands and a set of low cost brands. Premium brands often try to get a monopoly over one subset of customer, who need some special feature, or try to build their brand as something special, or otherwise differentiate. Premium brands explicitly do not compete on price. Salesmen will say stuff like, &quot;Look I know we are pricy. If you want the el cheapo software, don&#x27;t buy us. Buy us if you want the good stuff.&quot;<p>If the market just has premium brands, that all price way above cost of production, someone is going to try to enter the market with a lower cost product.<p>I never gathered what point Keen was trying to make, not what he was saying that was both novel and true.",1431210736

The non-trig ones, for example, include a division, and the best fit is a higher-order polynomial. There&#x27;s no reason to believe it will be as fast to evaluate, so the question would be, is it more accurate and is the accuracy worth the additional time? It would be ill-advised to use one of those if it ended up being both less accurate than log() and slower.<p>Concerning lookup tables, as tgbrter answered in this thread, they are likely slower. It still needs the scaling, and also needs two value lookups followed by an interpolation. The cost of doing the interpolation will be about the same as evaluating the second order polynomial, but the pipeline will be waiting on the two memory lookups.<p>Assuming everything in is L2 cache, that might not be a problem. But depending on the problem, it may be in L3 or (shudder) main memory, which is eons away.

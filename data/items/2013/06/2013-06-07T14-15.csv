If you aren&#x27;t being currently tracked, then your concern is about whether someone can backtrack forensically and find you. I think a simple trip to a public computer at a library, particularly at a busy time, affords as much pragmatic anonymity as jumping through all the hoops described in the article.<p>On the flip side, if you are already are under suspicion, then all your efforts to anonymize a leak are in vain. You&#x27;ll be the first person interrogated after a leak, and if your beliefs about the Orwellian nature of the government are true, the $10 hammer to the kneecaps (thanks XKCD) will undo any clever hiding you did.<p>I just don&#x27;t think it makes much sense to go to these lengths. It&#x27;s already understood that governments are corrupt. Are the specifics of what secrets you want to publicize worth the personal risk? If no, then you&#x27;re playing spy, which is fine. If yes, then they&#x27;ll probably find you if they really put their heart into it.",1370617195

5839256,comment,5838514,5838655,1,0,deanclatworthy,,,"The internet provides us with a mechanism of connecting with other people. The only advantage these internet services offer us is data redundancy, and the convenience of having an application accessible from wherever we are.<p>- In the case of a social network, have it decentralised and have user profiles and information hosted on the user&#x27;s computer, and only accessible when logged into the social network and only by those that you have granted permission for.
- Messaging could be directly between users, over an encrypted channel. If user A sends a message to user B it does not arrive until they connect their device to the internet. Only then does the secure exchange of a message occur. Group messaging is a more difficult problem.
- Cloud storage: if storage devices get bigger, smaller and cheaper there&#x27;s no reason why it couldn&#x27;t become normal for people to have physical backup solutions built into their devices. Alternatively, completely encrypted cloud storage where only the user has the keys could become the norm.<p>The problem lies in consumer acceptance, education and also convenience. If nobody understands the technologies they use to power their lives, it&#x27;s hard to communicate why things should be done alternatively. The EFF does a fantastic job of trying to protect our rights when it comes to technology, but I don&#x27;t think consumers get it. More needs to be done. The analogy of a man coming into your house and reading your mail that&#x27;s been posted through your door springs to mind. And finally, it has to be easy to do all these things in a private way. Better tools need to be created to allow us to securely store our information, communicate and perform tasks.",1370617076

Reasons like &quot;because of the Constitution,&quot; &quot;to protect people,&quot; &quot;to keep the United States a place of refuge for oppressed people,&quot; are all good reasons, but I think the best is simply that <i>it is evil to allow a good thing to be compromised or abrogated, so it is good to resist a compromising or abrogating force.</i> I cannot justify this by logic (why anyone should be good or want good) but I cannot be persuaded otherwise, and thankfully, many other people are the same way.<p>2. Our government is already oppressive to certain people, and there is a chance that the list of people it oppresses will grow. Most of them are foreign but a few are already domestic. The systems being built today are designed to increase our capacity to treat people this way, so it is reasonable to expect more people will be treated poorly. Additionally, history provides ample examples of nearly utopic nations, including republics, that did go on to commit atrocities and reduce the quality of the lives of their own people. It is not a slippery slope to want to take precautions to avoid the same. But again, this is all secondary to point #1 above.",1370616615

Lincoln differentiates between &quot;my view of official duty&quot;—that is, what he can do in his official capacity as President—and his personal views. Officially he must save the Union above all else; personally he wanted to free all the slaves:<p><i>I would save the Union. I would save it the shortest way under the Constitution. The sooner the national authority can be restored; the nearer the Union will be &quot;the Union as it was.&quot; If there be those who would not save the Union, unless they could at the same time save slavery, I do not agree with them. If there be those who would not save the Union unless they could at the same time destroy slavery, I do not agree with them. My paramount object in this struggle is to save the Union, and is not either to save or to destroy slavery. If I could save the Union without freeing any slave I would do it, and if I could save it by freeing all the slaves I would do it; and if I could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone I would also do that. What I do about slavery, and the colored race, I do because I believe it helps to save the Union; and what I forbear, I forbear because I do not believe it would help to save the Union. I shall do less whenever I shall believe what I am doing hurts the cause, and I shall do more whenever I shall believe doing more will help the cause. I shall try to correct errors when shown to be errors; and I shall adopt new views so fast as they shall appear to be true views. I have here stated my purpose according to my view of official duty; and I intend no modification of my oft-expressed personal wish that all men everywhere could be free.</i><p>Source: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln_and_slavery"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln_and_slavery</a>",1370615846

That&#x27;s exactly how the US was designed, but that&#x27;s not the way it is being run now.

My thoughts, below.  Please comment.<p>1.  I assumed (and, honestly, thought it was public knowledge) that this was happening already.<p>2.  The bulk of coverage (and reaction) seems to believe that NSA is listening to your conversations.  In fact (if I am dissecting the news correctly) they are recording the key details (length of call, location, to whom) and the actual message or conversation (not sure about this one), but only using this information after a second warrant.  Basically, they find a suspected terrorist by other means, get a warrant to access the records of his/her calls, and see who the suspected terrorist is in contact with.<p>3.  If the system works as described above, I&#x27;m a bit squeamish, but don&#x27;t see a huge issue.  I mean, I&#x27;m okay with Facebook, Verizon, Amazon, Visa, etc all having loads of info on me in order to sell me stuff, but once the government (who is not out to make a profit) does it, I object?  I&#x27;m not a fan of sacrificing freedom for security, but this logic doesn&#x27;t really make sense.<p>I probably have some other thoughts floating around, but these are the ones I&#x27;ve been mulling over.",1370614491

5838981,comment,5838622,5838862,4,0,brown9-2,,,"This is semantics. The original slides, and the WaPo writeup, made it sound as if the NSA has &quot;direct access&quot;, which to those of us who work in this area understand to mean &quot;they can login to the servers and do whatever they want&quot;. But it is clear that what is really meant is that the government can access all of the personal data that these companies have, provided the &quot;proper&quot; clearance and assertions by the NSA analyst.<p>TheNextWeb&#x27;s speculation that the change in wording means that the data is gathered &quot;indirectly&quot; doesn&#x27;t make a lot of sense:<p><i>For one thing, it adds to the growing claim that the agency instead accessed the information indirectly. In such a case, the most likely method would be via ISPs or mobile operators, but that remains unconfirmed.</i><p>Given that the WaPo wording specifically mentions &quot;company-controlled locations&quot;:<p><i>In another classified report obtained by The Post, the arrangement is described as allowing “collection managers [to send] content tasking instructions directly to equipment installed at company-controlled locations,” rather than directly to company servers.</i><p>What this more than likely means is that the NSA uses special-access &quot;portals&quot; provided by these companies to do their searching in. Meaning that the NSA accesses a special, locked down website provided and built by Google/Apple/Facebook etc to do their searching in, a site that runs within Google/Apple/Facebook&#x27;s datacenters/infrastructe, a system that has access to all of the backend data.<p>&quot;Direct access&quot; means something different to those of us that work with software systems like this all day long than it does to a journalist. We understand that to mean a login and shell access on a server, while the journalists seem to be misunderstanding &quot;direct&quot; versus &quot;indirect&quot; to refer to where the data is obtained from.<p>edit: think about it this way: would the government want access to the raw bytes stored on Google&#x27;s servers, which would require them to understand how to decode Google File System data and be kept 100% up to date on how all of Google&#x27;s backend systems work? Or would they prefer if Google provided them with a private search engine to access data, which Google has to keep up to date to work with all of the other Google systems?",1370614381

It takes courage and solidarity, but people power can gain freedom. The most thoughtful writer on the model that works is Gene Glass of the Albert Einstein Institute. The institute has several different publications available for free download in multiple languages,<p><a href=""http://www.aeinstein.org/organizationsde07.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aeinstein.org/organizationsde07.html</a><p>among which I especially recommend <i>From Dictatorship to Democracy: A Conceptual Framework for Liberation</i><p><a href=""http://www.aeinstein.org/organizations/org/FDTD.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aeinstein.org/organizations/org/FDTD.pdf</a><p>as a how-to guide for gaining freedom even when the dictators are willing to torture and kill to limit freedom.

7411567,comment,7411158,7411158,10,0,ChuckMcM,,,"This is a common grey/black hat SEO trick, basically create URL text that matches as many phrases as possible, and as demonstrated, easy to do with pretty simple cgi scripts and a bit of link seeding.<p>The theory behind it is that if your site has a lot of relevant &quot;targets&quot; then it must be more important than a site that has only a few targets. (Consider wikipedia as the poster child for this)<p>When people write naive web spiders in an attempt to create their own crawler, sites like this &#x27;trap&#x27; them in an infinite web of apparently unique links. Always a good idea to stop after a few hundred and kick it back to a human to see what is up with that :-)",1395007180

7411563,comment,7410519,7411435,6,0,Blahah,,,"<i>> This is not about &quot;societal benefit&quot;. Nobody but Monsanto benefits from Roundup Ready products</i><p>That&#x27;s just not true. Society benefits because we can avoid applying much more toxic and environmentally damaging herbicides and pesticides by using engineered resistance to pests or to harmless herbicides.<p><i>> They are a net detriment to society since the continual use of glyphosate will select for Roundup resistant weeds</i><p>This is a fallacy. All herbicide use selects for herbicide resistance. Herbicide resistance is a problem completely independent of GMOs, and is in no way exacerbated by using GMOs. Farmers have to use a huge quantity of herbicide regardless of whether they are growing GMOs cotton or organic quinoa.<p><i>> Then there&#x27;s the issue of residual glyphosate in our food supply.</i><p>The whole point of using glyphosate is that it&#x27;s one of the least harmful herbicides ever discovered. There is very little evidence of harm to humans even at much high doses than you would get in a lifetime of eating glyphosate-soaked food. Contrast that to every other broad action herbicide, which have various levels of toxicity but invariably higher than none.",1395007138

7411550,comment,7409611,7410364,1,0,wpietri,,,"Maybe. It depends on what you consider &quot;foundational&quot;.<p>The Lean Manufacturing people, for example, have very different foundations than traditional American MBAs. Not opposite, really; more orthogonal. For example, MBAs focus on cost reduction and profit increase; in the Lean world you focus on reducing waste and increasing customer value. This leads to different accounting systems, different management structures, different outcomes.<p>Reading about the history of Toyota, where Lean ideas were developed, I suspect it&#x27;s not accidental that they were both physically and culturally very distant from American business thinking. And that the background of Toyotas leaders was in engineering, not commerce.<p>Often when you ignore received wisdom, you are just forced to relearn it.

It&#x27;s a lifestyle thing and if they don&#x27;t consider the lifestyle people aspire to in their future plans, they are going to go bankrupt again.<p>Take a look at SF for an example. Many people would love to live in the few blocks surrounding the commercial areas of the Mission, the Haight (upper and lower), North Beach, Union Street, Hayes Valley, etc. Those areas are desirable because they are supremely convenient. They are the &quot;modern mall&quot; because they are also the &quot;timeless mall&quot;, i.e. the mall that naturally forms when people decide where they want to shop instead of corporate overseers. It&#x27;s a pattern that exists everywhere in the world in big modern cities to small towns designed before the advent of the car.<p>Betting on mixed use buildings creates &quot;captive demand&quot;, since your commercial store customers conveniently live right upstairs. And they are happy to live in such buildings because they provide the ultimate access by foot to food, bars, supermarkets and other businesses that enrich their lifestyle.<p>There are a few thing they need to do to make such mixed use properties desirable.<p>* Mixed use properties need authentic business with unique identity instead of franchises (e.g. a building with a starbucks and a moe&#x27;s underneath it isn&#x27;t as desirable as one with a neighborhood coffee shop and a local burrito joint).\n* The deals struck by commercial owner&#x27;s associations (COAs) need to consider the needs of the HOA which is often formed after the COA for any mixed use property. Any property (like the Beacon in SF) where the COA has unfair deals that prejudice the residents of a building often end up in litigation that suppresses the value of the the property in the building causing the building to move to having more renters than owners.<p>Unfortunately many of the new building projects in SF don&#x27;t take this into account. There are a ton of new projects going up south of the ballpark. All those properties will be filled because of the extremely limited stock of housing, but they are not going to be desirable places to live because of how few of those properties are designed to be mixed use, which is what will make that area feel like a neighborhood instead of a vertical suburb that you need to leave in order to visit a commercial center.",1395004877

In Windows 98, for example, everyone was implicitly considered an Administrator, even if they had no idea how to Administer anything. (They were <i>Users</i> with the full <i>Power</i> of an Administrator.)<p>What would frequently happen is that one person in an extended family would have such knowledge as to be capable of actually Administering computers, and would frequently have to drop in to perform Administrative maintenance for relatives, who had no idea they had to do such things themselves. Nobody would be looking out for the computer in the interstice.<p>This era is thankfully over. What do we have now? No greater number of people capable of Administering their own computers, certainly.<p>Instead, what happens now is that the hardware manufacturer provides hooks (the Secure Boot certificate store et al.) such that the computer&#x27;s Owner can delegate Administrative power to the OS distributor (Microsoft, Apple, Canonical, etc.), leaving the Owner as a plain User. &quot;That guy in the family who knows computers&quot; no longer has to be involved--effectively, the OS distributor <i>is</i> &quot;that guy.&quot;<p>This is only really a problem for people who <i>want</i> to Administer their own computers (though in any form-factor where you can buy a motherboard separately, all these protections <i>can</i> be disabled.)<p>Frankly, though, I see less and less of a need for people to Administer personal computers. PCs (I&#x27;m including both desktops and mobiles in this set), these days, are basically the equivalent of VT-100 terminals: fancy screens you buy, take out of the box, and plug directly into the internet.<p>This is what I would call the &quot;modern tinkerer mindset&quot;:<p>• &quot;Real Software&quot; runs on Impersonal Computers: servers, either racked in your office, or existing nebulously in &quot;the cloud.&quot; When you are developing this software, you keep a VM that simulates such an Impersonal Computer running on your Personal Computer, and interact with it as if it were a network resource.<p>• Development of new Operating Systems occurs using a hardware emulator (really a more precise VM), like qemu. It then moves to ordinary VM software. Everyone else who tries your hobbyist OS will only want to run it in a VM themselves. Getting it running on Real Hardware is a 1.0 feature.<p>• If you want to fiddle with hardware yourself, you get a Raspberry Pi, or any of innumerable other devices aimed squarely at tinkerers. You could develop an OS using these, too, although it&#x27;s a much greater hassle than just using emulation software. These devices are open in ways Personal Computers never were, having everything from schematics to JTAG pins available.<p>Given that mindset, what do you <i>gain</i> by having Administration rights to your new-age VT-100 Personal Computer?<p>You might answer &quot;the surety that Microsoft/Apple/etc. will never ban VM software from its platform&quot;, but no OS distributor would dream of doing this: after all, how, then, would its first- and third-party developers do their jobs? They rely on VM software just like the rest of us.",1395003752

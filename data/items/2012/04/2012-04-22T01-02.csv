I have previously done Web programming before realizing that it can get pretty expensive in terms of maintenance. With quality, premium plugins and themes, you can get a quality site out in about 6 hours and charge $300. I tweak the CSS and PHP of the existing themes to get close to the customer needs and have built a KB and a process internally to reduce the full site development 6 hours what it used to take 25 hours or more.<p>That is working good so far. It is also easy to maintain, I have WP_MU setup and can update a large number of sites in parallel.",1335059817
3873657,comment,3873589,3873634,7,0,soc88,,,"Dart is such an uninspiring, imagined-in-1995 language that I still wonder if I ever find a use-case for it.<p>This we-are-from-Google-and-everyone-else-is-stupid approach to language design is imho the real disease (also see the comment on Google Guava, that tells a lot).<p>I just don't want to develop in a language which throws the last 2 decades of language design experience over board because they designed a language for the lowest common denominator.<p>EDIT
====<p>Some people don't know the comment from the Google Guava authors, so here it is: <a href=""https://plus.google.com/113026104107031516488/posts/ZRdtjTL1MpM"" rel=""nofollow"">https://plus.google.com/113026104107031516488/posts/ZRdtjTL1...</a><p>The problem imho is that this attitude, behavior and world-view is endemic inside Google. (Look at all the NIH stuff written solely because it was non-Google.)<p>They think YOU are stupid and treat you like a kid, keeping away potentially useful functionality they deem to advanced for you.<p>Re ""decades of language design"":<p>- nulls, even for numbers. Seriously? So there is no efficient integer type which can be mapped to simple CPU instructions, but they also make sure that the arbitrarily sized one is slow without huge investments into VM technology and data flow analysis? Additionally, double is of course fixed length. Just wondering ... shouldn't this be exactly the other way around?<p>- A totally broken approach to types. The guy designing the language is more or less at war with static type systems. Seems like he is trying to prove a point by designing the most useless, statically-typed-looking system he can come up with. I mean seriously ... they allow people to write types down, but declare that they have no effect at all? Java did that too with the type erasure of Generics and everybody knows how that tiny amount of we-will-ignore-the-stuff-you-wrote worked out. Now extrapolate to a language which does that for everything.<p>- Single-implementation inheritance. Even the COBOL of language design (Java) is moving away from it. Designing a language in the 21st century lacking traits ... are they kidding me?<p>- Conflation of Null, Unit/Void and Bottom/Nothing.<p>IMHO, Dart is more or less a combination of all bad ideas of Java (poor Collection libraries, user-visible type erasure, semicola ...) and JavaScript (untyped, collection literals, no usable concurrency ...)<p>Really, Dart is like PHP. It is a hoax fooling people to believe it is a programming language. For instance: ""If the last statement of a function is not a return statement, the statement return null; is implicitly appended to the function body."" REALLY? Who in his right mind comes up with ideas like this?<p>Or this: ""Type void: [...] On the other hand, it is possible to return the result of a void method from within a void method. One can also return null; or a value of type Dynamic."" Are they KIDDING me?<p>Another one: ""It is a compile-time error for any type other than the types int and double to attempt to extend or implement num."" So not only are the provided types the most unfortunate combination imaginable, but the also make it hard for people who want to provide their own number types?<p>What the Web would have needed was a module system and an approach to security (because the current HTML5/JavaScript implementations of browser vendors lack any thought about it).<p>Sorry, if I got a bit aggravated at the end, but such remarkable bad language design just infuriates me, especially if it doesn't arise because the language designers are stupid but because they think their users are stupid.",1335059815

3873653,comment,3867466,3872902,1,0,WiseWeasel,,,"No, the better solution would be to add support for:<p><pre><code>  <meta img-x2-res=""_x2"" />
</code></pre>
This would alert the browser of the likely presence of 'filename_x2.ext' when it sees img tags, and it would fall back with a second request for 'filename.ext' in case it's not found. This seems relatively easy to implement (especially for web developers), and degrades gracefully on older browsers.<p>Then, a more fleshed out version accounting for the scenario you describe would be the following:<p><pre><code>  <meta img-x2-res=""_x2"" assume-present=""false"" />
</code></pre>
Then for any img tags for which double-res assets are available, you could add a property to the img tag as such:<p><img x2-res=""true"" /><p>Or, you could leave the 'assume-present' property off, as 'true' is default, and put '<img x2-res=""false"" />' on any images for which double-res assets are unavailable. This would avoid a second request when the first fails.<p>Such a solution would be significantly more convenient for developers, as you could choose whether to assume the presence of 2x and flag ones that don't have it, or assume its absence and flag those that do, saving tons of time.",1335059705

Many classic RPG's have a shortest path that's somewhere between 1/4 and 1/40th the average play-though and once you get close to it the game becomes a platformer vs. an RPG.  But, randomize locations and you get to relive the hunt the hunt on the next play though.  It also tends to make a wider range of things useful, vs letting people optimize the effort of finding stuff vs it's usefulness.",1335057870

Pedestrians on the tracks in an area they aren't supposed to be, who are struck and killed by trains, are classified in the bucket category of ""trespasser"" fatalities. Unless they left a note or something it's usually impossible to conclusively say that they were suicides, but the assumption is that the vast majority of trespasser fatalities are suicides, because the number of people struck while trying to steal things or take illegal shortcuts is relatively small. And, trespasser fatalities account for 88% of total commuter-rail fatalities (p. 13 in that report).

The specific names in an API and their relationships to each other seem like a creative work.<p>The trouble is that it is a compilation of facts. ""There is a function in Java called lastIndexOf in class java.lang.String that takes int as argument and returns int."" That's a fact. The formal specification of that fact is ""public int lastIndexOf(int)"" -- that can't be a creative expression of the fact because it's the only way you can formally represent it to the compiler. The language mandates that expression; you can't alter it so there is no opportunity for creativity.<p>Or to put it a different way, you might want to call it a creative endeavor to lay out a city and name all the streets. But if the person who named all the streets then comes around trying to claim a copyright over an independent cartographer's map of the city or the local phone book because it contains all of the street names, I wouldn't expect much sympathy.<p>But I think the crux of it is this:<p>>Someone invented that.<p>Exactly. Software development contains both engineering and creative components. The functional components are patentable (in countries like the US that have software patents). The creative components are copyrightable. But the API is strictly functional -- if there is any protection for it, it's in the domain of patents. You can call inventions creative all you like, but you can't copyright function.",1335056535

You also get to modify things like toolbars much more freely, and OS/toolkit theming usually also beats the GMail theming system.<p>You could argue that GMail has a higher customization potential given the fact that you can muck around with the document client-side (though Thunderbird extensions are similar, and if you really go down that road: I can also change the source code of KMail and recompile it), but we're talking in-app options here.<p>And so I find the notion that ""GMail has impressive configurability because it has the options described in the article"" amusing.

It does serve a purpose and I have argued in favour of it in the past.<p>But I do see opponents point that meta-discussion tends to get very repeating after a while and even self-serving. The latter is the reason I flagged this submission. It isn't so much the feature request, or the ""when should submissions be changed"" discussion, but the simple ""boohoo somebody changed MY submission boohoo THEY SHOULDN'T!""",1253275122

See <a href=""http://clojure.org/transients"" rel=""nofollow"">http://clojure.org/transients</a><p>Calling (transient x) gives you a mutable copy of x which is created in O(1) time.  You can then use functions like conj! and assoc! to modify the data structure in place.  When you've finished, call (persistent! x) which returns you to a pure data structure (another O(1) operation).",1253275081

But in an election the people that vote normally have some kind of interest in the outcome of the vote.<p>To ask a large number of outsiders who have otherwise no interest in the vote to come and vote for you to me seems to make the whole thing into a popularity contest, whoever has access to the largest communities will win the vote, regardless of the merit of the various candidates.<p>I don't think it is 'proper' to use the HN audience as a way to swing a vote one way or the other.

No system should involve the object which is to be verified presenting you with the credentials through which to verify it.<p>Cards should be as dumb as possible: They should have a unique ID printed on them.  Done.  Information on the cards is for the <i>cardholder</i>, not for the verifier.  Thus, it may be nice to put the name of cardholder on there, possibly a birth date, so that people don't get cards mixed up.  A expiration sticker may also be desirable to remind the cardholder he/she needs to renew.<p>Anything else you put on there (pictures, descriptions, fingerprints, etc) is dangerous because it will tend to make officials trust the cards, which is exactly what we don't want.  We also don't want anything on there which could be useful for someone else (baddies) to know.<p>No holograms, UV stripes, smart cards, etc are necessary, unless you think they're pretty and like spending money.

If you say something I don't like, I can sue you and you have to prove that every tiny detail of what you said is factual. Most people aren't going to be checking the dictionary definition of every word they speak or write just to check that they're being 100% factual. So therefore the person suppressing their speech will most likely win. The rest of the world likes to be a bit more sensible, it's up to the claimant to show that the information was incorrect, for things that actually matter this will be relatively easy to do.<p>Free speech with a few people getting away with a bit of name calling vs supression of valid points due to tiny mistakes in delivery.

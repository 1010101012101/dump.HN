5447099,comment,5446634,5446634,14,0,willurd,,,"I don't have a degree and I consider myself pretty successful. I'm no Zuckerberg but I haven't been unemployed since 18 (I'm 26). And, like others who've posted, I have to beat recruiters off with a stick. There is a lot of work out there if you have a good online presence.<p>Those are my credentials, now here's my advice: build a portfolio. And I don't mean a portfolio site or physical portfolio per se (though that would be best), I mean a body of work you've done that you can show off. All a degree really is is a piece of paper that says ""I know how to do all this stuff. Contact these people and they'll vouch for me."" Sure, some companies simply won't hire people without a degree, but you don't want to work for them anyway. Remember, you're smart, you're technically savvy, you're young, you're ambitious. Companies want YOU. Now, all you have to do is PROVE to companies that you can do the job. That's what a portfolio is for - it's actual, physical (or virtual) examples of your work; it's evidence that you know what you're doing. Make a blog and write some compelling articles. The blog, design, and articles are all examples of what you can do. Are you a designer? Make some icons, logos for companies that don't exist, or redesign an existing popular website just because <i>you can do better</i> or can offer a fresh outlook on their design (here's a guy that did this to Facebook: <a href=""http://www.behance.net/gallery/Facebook-New-Look-Concept/6504647"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.behance.net/gallery/Facebook-New-Look-Concept/650...</a>). Are you a developer? Find an interesting open source project (or 5), learn it, and start fixing bugs and adding features right away. Maybe even start your own open source project (you have a GitHub account, right?!). Remember, your portfolio doesn't have to contain work you've been paid for; it can be filled with things you did on your own simply because <i>you love what you do</i>. My portfolio is what got me hired when I first started out (it also pays to be confident and have some good interviewing/interpersonal skills; confidence is really all about perspective, though, and is, if you lack it, something you can achieve through things like reframing: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_reframing"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_reframing</a>, <a href=""http://changingminds.org/techniques/general/reframing.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://changingminds.org/techniques/general/reframing.htm</a>).<p>A few more things:<p>1. Companies aren't charities (even many charities aren't charities when it comes to hiring). They aren't there to hand out jobs to people just because those people need a job. They hire people because they have a void and believe that person can fill it. It is necessarily a mutually beneficial arrangement. You have to show companies that you are the person that can fill whatever voids they have.<p>2. If you don't have a resume, make one! Then put it online, on every site you can think of (LinkedIn, careerbuilder.com, monster.com, etc). If you contact me (my email is on my HN profile) I'll help you with your resume!<p>3. Many companies put in job descriptions that they <i>require</i> a 2 or 4 year degree. Sometimes this isn't really the case and, if you can demonstrate that you are the right person for the job, they will hire you anyway. This is what happened to me for my first job (it was a Fortune 500 company, so even they'll hire people without degrees sometimes!). So respond to every job description that looks interesting to you!<p>4. When you get an interview, and I know you will, do some research on the company before hand. Look at their website, check out what their doing, learn about their business domain, etc. If you're a web designer and/or web developer, think about ways you can improve their website and let them know you ""had some ideas"" while you were checking it out (don't make it seem like you didn't like their site, even if you didn't; be diplomatic about it).<p>5. I know I said I have to beat recruiters off with a stick; I don't actually beat them. Pro-tip #5: Don't burn bridges with recruiters. I have turned down more recruiters than I can count while at my current job because I'm not looking for work, but I always a) respond to them quickly, b) thank them for taking the time to contact me, c) thank them for considering me for whatever jobs they have available, d) let them know why I'm not available, and e) let them know that I'll keep an eye out for them if someone I know that fits one of their job descriptions is looking for work (and I mean it; I have forwarded several friends to recruiters). Sometimes I'll even talk to recruiters on the phone so they can get to know me (I always tell them up front that I'm not looking for work, but sometimes they want to talk anyway). Because of this, I have a huge list of people I can contact that might be able to help me should I find myself out of work.<p>I'm sure other people will have other perspectives and experiences. I hope this or something else on this page helps you!<p>EDIT: Also, when you're not spending time working on your resume, contacting companies and recruiters, committing to open source projects, redesigning popular websites, making logos for non-existent companies, or otherwise beefing up your portfolio, spend time making yourself better (for free!): <a href=""https://www.coursera.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.coursera.org/</a>, <a href=""https://www.edx.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.edx.org/</a>, <a href=""http://ocw.mit.edu/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ocw.mit.edu/</a>, <a href=""https://www.canvas.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.canvas.net/</a>, <a href=""https://www.udacity.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.udacity.com/</a>, <a href=""http://webcast.berkeley.edu/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://webcast.berkeley.edu/</a>, <a href=""http://www.academicearth.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.academicearth.org/</a>, <a href=""http://ocw.tufts.edu/CourseList"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ocw.tufts.edu/CourseList</a>, <a href=""http://www.open.edu/openlearn/tags"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.open.edu/openlearn/tags</a>, <a href=""http://www.cs.washington.edu/education/courses/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.washington.edu/education/courses/</a>, <a href=""http://ocw.nd.edu/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ocw.nd.edu/</a>, <a href=""http://law.duke.edu/webcast/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://law.duke.edu/webcast/</a>, <a href=""http://oyc.yale.edu/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://oyc.yale.edu/</a>.

5447097,comment,5446728,5446728,46,0,inopinatus,,,"I've just read through the Persona protocol specification document at <a href=""https://github.com/mozilla/id-specs/blob/prod/browserid/index.md"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/mozilla/id-specs/blob/prod/browserid/inde...</a> and was quite disappointed to find RFC5785 in use, in which HTTP is abused as an infrastructure discovery protocol.<p>This gives a lie to the identity being an ""email address"". It isn't. Ok, it's structured as a LHS@RHS form but the domain in the RHS isn't an email domain, it's an overloaded website with some problematic assumptions ladled in.<p>This creates a significant barrier to adoption. Many entities just won't bother: not only does it ask an apex A record to serve actual content (usually a mistake) but it requires the primary web host of a registerable domain, usually a trademark or brand identity, to carry technical material, definitely a clash of concerns.<p>(Why? In many companies of reasonable size, the website is managed by a completely different group of people - often a marketing team - to the internal identity service.  Then, even if one team convinces to the other to install the browserid file, there is a possibility of it being deleted it by mistake during the next site refresh.)<p>I had hoped to find an intermediate step where a DNS SRV lookup was used to first locate the host delivering the browserid file.  This follows the federated structure of email rather more closely and allows the identity service to be independent of the corporate brochureware.  Even better - if the SRV lookup could be signed with DNSSEC, the transfer itself can be protected with DANE. The whole thing becomes manageable as a simple, separate unit of technology.  It is thus rather more likely to gain the support of system administrators.",1364345973

It is not realistic to have a world where you have 1,000 mom and pop search engines instead of 1 Google.

If restarted the memory errors would return.  Basicly turned out this memory would overheat after 5 days of slowly building up the heat, though a hour turned off would resolve it.  That was a fun RMA given most would soak test for 3 days :(.  Cheaper memory won out in the end just fine and never had a problem with it.<p>As for single bit errors, well had fun on many a ISDN line which would get the odd error, not on networking thats fine, error correction.  On realtime video, you see it.  Then if a line gets so many errors it shuts off, you call up the teclo, they run diagnostics and all is fine and its suddenly working again.

Weekly groups for various languages, frameworks, etc.  That can be a really good place to meet people and network.  You probably don't want to show up and ask for a job, but it's a great way to bounce ideas off of similarly-minded people, make friends, learn new things or hone your skills, etc.<p>I also think getting a job - any job, McDonalds, Walmart, whatever - is an important (even if it's miserable) step, because it's SO MUCH EASIER to get a job when you already have one.  Even if it takes several bounces up the ladder, it's very difficult to go from being unemployed to being employed in a good job in the field you're interested in.  I've got no degree and no have an amazing job working as a developer for one of the most difficult-to-get-hired-at places in tech.  I worked (I will omit the time from 17 years old to 27 years old, because I honestly can't remember all of the jobs I had in that period, but the last year or so I was unemployed) for an office furniture dealership (through a temp agency at first), then got a tech-support job for a small software company, worked hard enough to get a little more responsibility and learned some networking/sysadmin-type stuff, learned some sql, hacked around with Python and Ruby, and got a chance to be a developer.  Never looked back.  I'm 30, for reference, and I've also been homeless and had to sleep on friends' couches, lived paycheck-to-paycheck or sold belongings on craigslist to pay the rent at times, etc.  Hang in there.  It's hard to hear, but once things work out and you ""get there"", you tend not to give a fuck about the path it took to get there.<p>See if you can get to a tech meetup, or just hang out in IRC, post on tech forums, etc.  Get the best job you can, but get any job before no job.  Sometimes temp agencies can be a really good way to start - I've worked for several.  They're usually indoor, business-casual, 9 to 5 office jobs.  Don't expect it to be interesting, of course, but some of these places will get you _a_ job right away as long as you're reasonably polite/presentable and can type fast, and it'll probably be a little bit better than the bottom-end of the retail/fast-food spectrum in terms of pay.<p>Like zaphar said: Good luck and don't give up.",1364345169

I fear that my inability to find freelance work or secure an internship will preclude me from the vast majority of jobs. Moreover, my grades are fairly mediocre (something largely attributable to depression and general apathy), which effectively prevents being accepted to most colleges. This then puts me into a situation whereby I'm forced to attend a state university, which, although technically has a lower sticker price, has a higher net cost because state schools don't meet full need. Moreover, in many cases obtaining a degree from middling college is tantamount to not having a degree.

You might think I'm joking, but manual labor has the benefit of focusing the mind, and there are numerous labor intensive jobs that pay very very well.<p>Here are three you might consider: working on a fishing boat / working on a oil rig / joining the US Armed Forces.<p>The first two of those are very good money with a bit of risk with not a particularly long time commitment. After you are out of your financial hole you can transition to doing something else. The Armed Forces is not a bad option if you are looking for something that could be a longer term option for you and potentially include training in skills you are interested in.<p>Also, in general, getting jobs is first and foremost about confidence. I suspect you don't have a lot, so going out there and doing something where you can build confidence (my suggestion not knowing you is through a body focused manual labor activity, but that may not be the best), and then use that confidence to build skills, and then go out and get a job that makes use of those skills. That's a general strategy that can carry you for your whole life, the trick is to avoid getting stuck in a depressive cycle (which seems like where you are now).<p>Anyways, good luck mate, wish you the best!",1364344200

In Go, lightweight threads are preempted by the runtime whenever an operation that can block is made (IO, channel send/receive, system calls, etc.). However, lightweight threads can hog the CPU, and in that sense, they must be cooperative. But this rarely shows up outside of pathological cases in practice.<p>More importantly, I wasn't talking about scheduling. I was talking about lightweight threads. They are also commonly known as: goroutines, green threads, fibers, user space threads, etc. This has a dramatic effect on the style of concurrent programming, as spawning a light weight thread is cheap relative to spawning an OS thread.<p>Joe Armstrong explains [1] things better than I can:<p><pre><code>    Processes in Java or C# are pretty much like the objects in the flawed object \n    system which we described earlier - you can’t have many of them, and if you \n    have more than a few hundred processes the system will start misbehaving and \n    to do any real work with them you have to write your own scheduler and start \n    combining multiple threads of control into single processes. All of this \n    gives concurrent programming a bad name - and would probably make any sane \n    person think that concurrent programming was a difficult and should be avoided \n    whenever possible. The opposite is true.\n</code></pre>\nAnd:<p><pre><code>    In Erlang processes are *light weight*. This means that very little \n    computational effort is required to create or destroy a processes. Light-weight \n    processes in Erlang are one to two order of magnitude lighter than operating \n    system threads.\n    \n    Not only are Erlang processes light-weight, but also we can create many \n    hundreds of thousands of such processes without noticeably degrading the \n    performance of the system (unless of course they are all doing something at the \n    same time).\n</code></pre>\nIn Go, ""goroutines"" are analogous to ""processes"" in Erlang in the above excerpt.<p>My point here was that Go solves the concurrency problem much differently than Java does, to a point where Go is much better suited to write concurrent programs than Java is. Joe Armstrong's argument in his paper applies pretty well here.<p>I'm not really sure what is to be gained by debating over whether Go was ""intended"" to be in the same domain as Java. I've used Go to solve problems that I might have otherwise solved in a variety of other languages (C, Haskell, Python). Had I ever been a Java programmer, I'm sure that would have been in the list too. Experience in speaking with other Go programmers leads me to believe that I am not unique in this regard.<p>[1] - ""Concurrency oriented programming in Erlang"", 2003. <a href=""https://guug.de/veranstaltungen/ffg2003/papers/ffg2003-armstrong.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://guug.de/veranstaltungen/ffg2003/papers/ffg2003-armst...</a>",1364343606

The actual local data needed to pull it off could be replicated (encrypted) to cloud storage so it would work across all your devices and browsers, but the actual profile data itself would never be readable by the servers.<p>I started looking at the feasibility of building something like Persona into a 'serverless' social network a while ago using Broadcast Encryption techniques to define social sharing groups with revocation (de-friending) and Identity Based Encryption, but it seems like the state of the art IBE always requires a trusted server somewhere. But someone with more expertise in cryptography than me can maybe make it work.

The fact that a larger disparity exists between the ultra-wealthy in the West and impoverished people in the third world (though, to be fair, many parts of the West are beginning to resemble the third world) does not invalidate the point that inequality also exists within the first world.<p>Just because impoverished Africans can't get Ashton Kutcher to invest in their startup doesn't mean that you or I can.",1364342442

5446850,comment,5446634,5446634,2,0,nonamegiven,,,"Good suggestions here already.<p>You might look for jobs on Craigslist. It sounds like right now you're looking for anyjob, for cash/rent. Be willing to do about anything, you're not choosing a career right now you're just taking money from people without stealing. Depending on who you work for, some of them might have interesting ideas or contacts.<p>If you can get to North Dakota you might work in the oil fields, but I hear it's hard to find a place to stay; boom times and all.<p>I don't know the producer business, I'm guessing there's much more opportunity programming. Don't know your experience. Pick a language, start making stupid little things and put them on github. The first stuff doesn't have to be impressive, doesn't have to be web whiz bang, just anything that gets you thinking in the language. If you get far enough along before you get an interview you can take the earlier ones down. If you're lucky enough for someone to consider you earlier, for the type of job you might be talking about, you can point to even your small silly projects and say ""hey, this is what I've been doing to build my skills.""<p>Whatever language you pick, learn the debugger, it will teach you more than the debugger.<p>Read something enjoyable, it's a cheap way to do something good for yourself and to get your mind off your troubles. Make it non-career oriented at least some of the time. You can get things at the library, or a used book store. Finding a good, old, funky used book store is a delight.<p>Your health matters. Exercise as well as you're able. Challenge yourself to eat as well as you can on the least amount of money. Beans and such go a long way for very cheap. These two things can be some of your reading. Learn as much as you can practically use about them.<p>Help someone.",1364342422

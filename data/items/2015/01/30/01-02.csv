8970086,comment,8969700,8969700,0,0,jriordan,,,"Here&#x27;s why census data is relevant: If you receive an extended survey from the U.S. census, you are legally required to fill it out with all sorts of personal data. If you don&#x27;t return it, a census rep will hound you until you do.<p>The &quot;Privacy Policy&quot; for this data is on the U.S. Census website here:<p><a href=""http://www.census.gov/about/policies/privacy/data_protection.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.census.gov/about/policies/privacy/data_protection...</a><p>Note the statement that &quot;the statistics we release do not identify individuals or businesses&quot;.<p>During the last census, it became pretty obvious that this would be an effective way for the U.S. Government to compel information from people who were suspected of something. Section 215 of the Patriot Act, after all, gives the government carte blanche to obtain any &quot;tangible&quot; thing.<p>IMHO... the interesting questions to ask when this legal opinion is released are:<p>1. Was there ever any accuracy to the U.S. Census &quot;Privacy Policy&quot;? Were the privacy policies of the U.S. Census misrepresented to the public, and in particular to those who were required to complete an extended survey?<p>2. Does the legal opinion address the &quot;third-party doctrine&quot; when the information provided is provided under legal <i>compulsion</i>, and in particular with potential (if commonly unused) penalties for non-cooperation?<p>A very interesting test case would be for someone to sue the government, in light of the upcoming 2020 census, to test the constitutionality of the criminal liability for not completing the extended survey in light of the government using the information provided for potential law enforcement purposes. It should be easier than usual to establish standing since anyone can be forced to complete one of these extended surveys.",1422583008

Most high-rep users got there by being good at seeing things from a newbie&#x27;s point of view, and thus being able to explain things well to newbies.<p>The answers that get the most upvotes, and give you the most reputation, are the basic problems that everyone has, since then everyone finds that question, and upvotes the answer that solves the problem for them.<p>I&#x27;ll note that as a high-rep user (top 0.1% overall), I more often see the moderate-rep users as the ones closing a lot of questions. The high-rep users are busy getting more reputation by actually answering questions, it&#x27;s the moderate rep users that have just enough to be able to vote to close that wind up spending all of their time policing the site.<p>The biggest problem that I have with SO is the review queue, which queues up questions that have close votes or flags, in order to get a quicker resolution, and rewards people with badges for spending a lot of time reviewing questions that they don&#x27;t really know much about. I&#x27;ve seen so many slightly vague questions closed because of that, when if you had actually just spent a few minutes getting the user to clarify via comments, you could have figured out what their actual problem was and answered it. But because there&#x27;s a review queue, and badges for reviewing lots of questions, answers, edits, etc, some people just spend all their time in there rather than actually trying to answer or clarify.<p>Anyhow, I very frequently hear vague complaints about SO, but it&#x27;s much more informative to look at particular examples. Do you have examples of questions that have been closed that you don&#x27;t think should have been? As a high-rep user, I can vote for them to be re-opened, and as an experienced user I can help reword them and make them more clear so that they will be more likely to be reopened and less likely to be closed.<p>By the way, one thing that can be challenging is figuring out, from a question that doesn&#x27;t provide enough information, what the user is asking. This is hard for anyone to figure out, newbie or experienced user. The best way to avoid this is to ask questions clearly. State the exact problem you&#x27;re trying to solve, show a small code example that demonstrates the problem, state what you&#x27;ve tried in order to solve it. And state a question that can be solved objectively; there&#x27;s no way to provide a good, unambiguously correct answer to an opinion question, and the whole reason for StackOverflow to exist is to provide good, unambiguously correct answers, not to prompt endless discussion threads in which everyone discusses their favorite X.<p>If you follow these guidelines, you should generally be able to get a good answer on SO, and not have your question closed (unless as a duplicate, which is another way of solving your problem by redirecting you to existing answers).",1422582141

The question therefore in this type of equation is about as follows: what is the square which combined with ten of its roots will give a sum total of 39? The manner of solving this type of equation is to take one-half of the roots just mentioned. Now the roots in the problem before us are 10. Therefore take 5, which multiplied by itself gives 25, an amount which you add to 39 giving 64. Having taken then the square root of this which is 8, subtract from it half the roots, 5 leaving 3. The number three therefore represents one root of this square, which itself, of course is 9. Nine therefore gives the square.”</i><p>If you interpret <i>square</i> to mean a literal square, then x can&#x27;t be -13 as that would give a square whose sides are negative in length.",1422581936

It took eons to get anything resembling life at all, and then a small slice of that to get animals, and an even smaller to get humans.<p>I think one key idea here, though, is that the evolution of intelligence is in fact the evolution of intelligence-<i>producing</i> systems. In other words, nature is producing systems that are better and better at &quot;self-improvement&quot;, and I think proponents of &quot;intelligence explosion&quot; overestimate how much self-improvement could be improved via AI. Personally, I suspect indefinite self-improvement is flatly impossible because that&#x27;s akin to saying that there exists an <i>incremental</i> learning algorithm that systemically finds global minima. As AI research suggests, though, such algorithms likely don&#x27;t exist at all: if you want to get truly optimal AI there is a point where nothing in your current state is salvageable and you just gotta restart from zero.

Your comment makes me feel comfortable enough getting it there.<p>Speaking of manuals, I could swear that I once accessed a manual for a PS4 downloadable game. But I&#x27;ve never since been able to figure out how I did that, to the point where I question whether it ever even happened. But it seems absurd to believe that they decided that games simply don&#x27;t need manuals. I get that console games are trending towards having a very minimalistic manual in the game box (often just a page with the control layout), but not every game does that.",1422580200

This makes no sense at all:<p>> Don’t ever move into an apartment, TIC, condo, or house that has been cleared by an eviction<p>So landlords should be forced to rent to people forever who can&#x27;t pay? That makes no sense. It is just stealing the property from the property owner.<p>I know a lot of landlords and they hate doing evictions, because the tenants aren&#x27;t paying their rent the entire time they are being evicted. The ones I know often say to the judge, I don&#x27;t want money back from this person (which is generally impossible anyway because the person is poor), I just want to be able to rent my property to someone who can pay.

However, there&#x27;s a cultural reluctance to consense on its existence, unless absolutely positively certain. Fears like yours, about what Martian life could imply about the uniqueness and longevity of our species, are part of the reason for the reluctance.<p>Note that if life is confirmed on Mars, it needn&#x27;t have independently evolved. Simple life might be more common, even dormant in interplanetary space, than generally believed – seeding both Earth and Mars from earlier sources. (This is the theory of &quot;panspermia&quot;.) Or, the same collision processes that brought the Martian-meteor with maybe-fossils to Earth, could have carried live spores between the planets – so a single microbial-evolution inside our solar system could reach multiple planets.<p>Of course then your Fermi fears still apply.

    bitmatch bits with
    | { width : 5;
        data : width } ->
        printf ""width %d data %Ld\n"" width data
</code></pre>
It reads the first five bits of the file, interprets these bits as a number, then reads the next 0-31 bits from the file (note: not aligned, the first 3 bits come from the first byte in the file).<p>The nice thing is that if everything can be shown at compile time to be aligned to byte/word boundaries, then it all turns into relatively efficient calls to C.<p>There are some more realistic examples on the web page:<p><a href=""https://code.google.com/p/bitstring/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://code.google.com/p/bitstring/</a>",1325325342

It's the big stinking pile of cash that is the force which continuously tries to leak through a dam and overflow down to congress.

They only know C++ and hence this is the natural way they think. They believe that C++ can solve every problem (which is true, as for almost every other language) and some of them are so arrogant to claim that C++ is above everything else and that they don't need anything else. The latter could also be true, but the problem is: Whoever knows only a hammer as a tool sees every problem as a nail :-)<p>When you are a C++ developer but also know Lisp, Python etc. then you will write your C++ code in a different way that uses better paradigms. They are provably superior because C++ itself is learning from them and copying features, see C+11: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B11"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B11</a><p>Unfortunately the horrible syntax of C++ remains. It was extended from C to C++ in such a way that it still reflects the underlying von-Neumann architecture. That makes C++ code so performant. Functional languages are not so performant because they prefer power of expression over von-Neumann compatibility.

There's a bunch of fallback #ifdefs in the code: on platforms that don't have alloca, it detects the end of the stack by calling a forced-non-inline function which returns the address of its sole local variable, but that assumes that the compiler supports the 'noinline' keyword.

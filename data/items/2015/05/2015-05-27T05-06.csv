From that, I&#x27;m reading that it could be possible to modify an encrypted directory so as to cause key or plaintext content leakage if the directory is accessed again or the volume is re-mounted.<p>Does Full Disk Encryption have this problem as well (mounting a maliciously modified full disk encrypted filesystem could result in disclosure)?",1432706267

The &quot;binary tree&quot; benchmark is the only one that is 25% worse than the old version, but in my opinion it is an important benchmark, because I suppose that this benchmark actually creates a lot of objects that need to be garbage collected. At least that is what I suppose, based on the fact that this holds for binary tree algorithms. The other benchmarks are mostly about formatting and regexping, which require much less objects to be created on the heap, and these are making the benchmarks look better.",1432705611

I was there for nearly 10 years and had good coaching through 5 promotions.  One of the things that was kind of nice about the system is that my managers were always really good at spelling out exactly what was going to be expected of me in order to reach the next level.  Unfortunately, the requirements just keep ratcheting up, and I got to the point where what my manager laid out as the next set of requirements was simply never going to happen.  I wasn&#x27;t interested in putting in ever-increasing effort and taking on ever-increasing responsibilities.

He was a moody bastard with a quick temper, probably as a result of several years of flying sorties over the Atlantic that lasted many hours—a dreadful combination of boredom and intense anxiety and fear.<p>My mum was more forthcoming.

It&#x27;s &quot;low res&quot; in the same way a phone voice-mail menu is low-res <i>&quot;press 1 for x, press 2 for y, press 3 for z, etc&quot;</i>. You get bits of information sequentially, stacked in time.  The onus is on you, the receiver, to piece the information together into some sort of mental matrix so you can make your decision. 
A high-res counter-example would be seeing all options together, like you would in a table of contents.<p>One way PPT is low-res is that there is not enough room on a slide to type full sentences. It <i>wants you</i> to dilute your thoughts into a bullet list or some similar fragmented format.<p>Often a presentation involves a series of slides, and ideally you&#x27;d want the audience to make comparisons between slides e.g. <i>Before XXX, After XXX, & Therefore XXX is good.</i> The sequentiality of slides is another example of it being low-res. This increases the cognitive effort needed to engage with your content, making it difficult for anyone to actually think critically about what you are saying.  In other words, it&#x27;s a great sales tool!<p>The paper handout is an excellent idea. You can fit the information of about 250 ppt slides onto a standard 11x17 sheet of paper.<p>PPT can be useful in other cases (I&#x27;ve used it for drawing seating charts), but it tends to be pretty terrible for presenting any sort of analytical content.

Windows is still the monopoly on PC with 90+% share due OEM and EFI. For the mobile devices both iOS and Android are big, then comes the smaller rest of Win, Blackberry, Bada, Jelly, Ubuntu, FirefoxOS, etc. WinCE had a head start 20 years ago, but especially the die hard Windows users turned away from WinMobile 6.5 (CE based) as it was dumped with all its app eco system in favor of WinPhone 7 (still CE but with only Silverlight/XAML apps) that was as useful as Android 1 or iOS 1.",1432703166

I have friends who work for non-pros, mostly because they&#x27;re lawyers who need to pay the bills somehow.<p>More than a few have told me that the majority of their time is met filing for grants, doing &quot;shady&quot; book-keeping and fulfilling whatever minimum requirements needed to earn said grants. The shady book-keeping has caused more than a few to leave.<p>No, of course not all non-pros are that way. But, comparing church to a non-pro seems as useful as comparing the NFL to a non-pro, which until this year, the NFL was a non-profit.

Very far from it, but in my N=1 anecdotal experience, the only difference between church and a non-religious non-pro, is the religion.<p>Not at all an attack towards you, I was hopeful you had data to back up your claim. I am still hopeful.

For example, if 65% of the population would vote for candidate 1, an unbiased sample of size 10 would indicate that either 60% or 70% of the population would vote for candidate 1. A sample that is biased could literally tell you anything, regardless of how large it is (in absolute numbers).",1432702836

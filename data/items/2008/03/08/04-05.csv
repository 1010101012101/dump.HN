It didn't make sense to buy brand new hardware/software for folks who already have a wonderful setup on their machine.<p>Of course then there was this guy who didn't want to do official work on his personal laptop. We offered to buy him a laptop of his own choice (we specified a max price of course). He got a HP something (doesn't like Mac's) and runs some version of linux on it.<p>Likewise we have no artificial restrictions on software they use - say editors, jabber chat clients, mail clients etc etc, as long it all works well.<p>As long as the programmers are hacking away in an env that can run our stack well we have no problems with what they run. Keeps the programmers happy.",1204952152

It also makes it possible for middle and lower class children to have private education rather than having that option end up a further luxury for just the rich.",1204951865

I think it will tend to benefit academic families more than disadvantaged communities.<p>If you have two parents working and they're earning less than $75,000 per year combined, I kind of wonder how they're going to afford the kind of things an MIT-caliber mind needs, growing up.",1204951543

131773,comment,131342,131342,0,0,andreyf,,,"> Not sure if this is kosher or not...<p>I think this kind of thing should be encouraged a lot more. Some kind of geography - matching would help foster a more mature community. hackrtrackr.com tried it, but I think it would work better if it were built into the system. Maybe a link on top called ""local"" that would somehow connect me to people around my major city (which I specify in the settings)?<p>^ more details in posts like this are a good idea, also. I think secrecy in startups seems to be overrated, but from the way YC tends to do business, they seem to disagree. I guess they reason it's better to err on the side of secrecy, and I'm probably irrationally biased because of the political associations of the word, but in <i>this</i> case, it seems like a good idea to talk freely.",1204951108
131772,comment,131691,131759,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"Um, yeah, if your metric for success is ""I've read more articles than the other guy"" or ""I've published more papers than the other guy"", obviously you'll benefit from... reading more articles and publishing more papers.<p>Personally I don't give a crap that I am 10% as ""productive"" as John Tukey. I suspect that his productivity made him happy, but that it bought him no more happiness than my own, somewhat lesser productivity buys me. I'm pretty damn sure that all his work didn't bring him much extra money or buy him one extra year of life. I suspect that my friends and relations would rather have 10% more of my time than watch me publish 10% more papers. And I'm with DHH: If I worked with guys like Tukey I would quit rather than be constantly told that I'm some kind of slacker because -- unlike Tukey -- I have more than one interest in life. I know this is true, because I <i>did</i> work in academia with guys like Tukey, and I <i>did</i> quit.<p>[NOTE: I actually know nothing about the life of the real John Tukey. I'm using the poor guy, as Hamming did, as a notional example of the workaholic. For all I know, Hamming and his boss were wrong, and the actual Tukey had lots of fun hobbies, spent most of his life having fun, and was famous as a genius because <i>he was, in fact, a genius</i> who could do more in three days on the job than most could do in a year. I mean, that plan worked for Feynman.]",1204950714
131771,comment,131668,131668,0,0,andreyf,,,"Short answer: No, assuming you meant ""should <i>every</i> CS senior know what a .tar file is?"".<p>Long answer: Not always. Large and fascinating branches of CS has nothing to do with computers. A programmer looking to work on UNIX-based file systems should know what a .tar file is.<p>A commitment to GUI interfaces (and general mouse love) and not knowing .tar files probably just means the person had only seen Windows. I'd say the average child will take a week of dedicated learning before OK at using command line/Linux-based OS's. It would probably be a good idea to have a little intro-course to people who haven't seen Linux (kind of like a summary of OS class in college) at your company to catch these people up.<p>One of the things that bothers me most about the snobbier computer enthusiasts is how much pride they take in their curiosity, even if what they learn isn't all that impressive - it would take less than a minute to explain .tar file is to a degree more thorough than understood by half of the people who use them.",1204950420

131768,comment,131668,131668,0,0,eb,,,"Interesting. To become a competent programmer, a person has to spend a significant amount of time exploring and learning all of the nuances involved.<p>What other fields of study require this sort of initiative outside of the classroom? Is it enough for a chemist to go to class and complete the homework?<p>I can't think of any field where curiosity is as important as in computer science and where the classroom is so insufficient.",1204950096

So this will probably be unpopular.<p>But I think that you are hitting an interesting point: you could develop hacker news in about a week and I'm sure it is accurate if you say so. But a fully developed site ready for launch is only a small step on the road to fame and riches. A lot of people fail to see this. (not you of course, other people)",1204948871

From what I've seen of it, Java seems to be hard to maintain. The capacity for abstraction is limited, leading to repeated or generated code in multiple locations. To make matters worse, hooking in to things requires that they be designed to be hooked in to. Contrast Common Lisp method combination.",1248687270

725617,comment,724420,725523,0,0,RiderOfGiraffes,,,"An interesting video, that reinforces everything I saw when I explain these effects - I've taken a copy and must get in touch with the owner to talk about using it.<p>The point about Bernoulli is that it only applies in its naive form in fluid flow where it's effectively a closed system.  If you introduce airstreams of varying speeds then all bets are off.<p>Effectively Bernoulli works because the velocity changes are being caused by the pressure differences.  Take a very, very long plate with a hump in small part of it:<p><pre><code>    ____________XXXX____________
</code></pre>
Laminar flow requires that the ""streamlines"" are closer over the top becuase there is, effectively, less space to get through.  The fluid has mass, so tries to go in a straight line.  Considerably above the plate the fluid will move effectively in a straight line, so the fluid between that straight line and the plate has to move faster.<p>As the fluid approaches that faster flowing area, it must accelerate, and the only thing to accelerate it is a pressure gradient.  In the video he is using other means to accelerate the fluid flow, so it's different.<p>At the end of the plate there is no downwash, so the only effect is Bernoulli, and in this experiment you do get a pressure difference between the sides of the plate, and hence ""lift"".<p>In the case of the flow around the ""elbow"" there is no acceleration of the air, hence no Bernoulli effect.  Quite the opposite, I would expect a Bernoulli effect to push the ""elbow"" to the left.  However, the air is being sucked around the plate, so the ""downwash"" effect dominates.<p>There are some really, really bad explanations in the literature and on the net, often written by people who do one experiment without separating the effects.  They go on to teach, and unsurprisingly people get confused.",1248686177
725616,comment,724420,724676,0,0,marvin,,,"For upside-down flight, though, the shape of the wing isn't irrelevant. Many aerobatic aircraft have symmetric wing profiles, since the curvature of the wing reduces performance when inverted. (Higher speeds are required to maintain the required lifting force, and drag is increased).<p>Some of the popular explanations of aerodynamic lift are outright wrong, but most of them are correct about part of the story. Our CFD equations are obviously correct, otherwise our simulation software would give bad results. Maybe it's just hard to explain the results of these equations in an unambiguous way.<p>It is true that ""air goes down, wing goes up"", but this explanation is only one ""why"" closer to the heart of the matter.",1248686059

There is a SAMS book by Justin Rogers which does cover the basics.<p>You might be better off looking at something like Adobe AIR which is an excellent approach to making a web style application run like a desktop application - well worth exploring and could be a good platform for developing portable (and applicable) JavaScript skills.",1248686043

This is then called RNA.<p>Why do they do this? well the T protein is very vulnerable. By replacing it, they can now safely transport the rna to the place where they're duplicated.",1248685834

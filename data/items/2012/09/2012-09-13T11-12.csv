I assume you're referring to nervousness about having your back facing a room?</i><p>Open-back visibility is unnatural. Picture a man, comfortably reading a book, and a tree. Where is the tree? Invariably, it's right behind him.<p>When people are in a loud or uncomfortable environment, one of the first instincts is to guard their back. Modern office environments don't allow this. Most have traffic corridors behind the person who is working. Over 8 hours, the stress builds up.<p><i>My wife is ""neurotic"" about other people being behind her and being able to see her computer. She also has significant hang-ups with believing that people don't like her (as far as I can tell, they do), and general depression.</i><p>I'm not a doctor, and I don't know your wife, but to me, this sounds like social anxiety. A lot of office environments make it 10 times worse than it needs to be.<p>There's also such a thing as ""secondary depression"", which is depression induced by an anxiety disorder. Office-induced social anxiety usually leads that way.<p>At some point, I learned that no one cares what is on my computer (as long as I'm not obviously fucking off) because everyone is playing his or her game rather than trying to evaluate mine, but it took me years to really get that.<p><i>your position -- that the ""normal"" people are indignant about having to somehow compete harder due to ""the weak"" having access to anti-anxiety drugs and anti-depressants -- seems unfounded in the available evidence.</i><p>No, not all the ""normal"" people. However, there are people out there who feel very negatively about the use of these drugs, that they're ""propping up the weak"", and this is the source of that attitude. Society has been stack-ranking people for some time based on their ability to handle stupid stresses in large amounts, and psychiatric medicines change the game. But that's a good thing, because that game doesn't deserve to exist in the first place.",1347534587

Its important to position your product for maximum effect (usually maximum profit, but that may not be the case here)<p>The arguments for FirefoxOS seem to be<p>1. It's OSS
2. It's Web-technologies only
3. It's aimed at the ""emerging"" markets' mobile users
4. It runs on cheaper hardware better than the competition<p>1 and 2 are great.  And no-one but us cares, except in 20 years when no child has even seen a line of code because OSS gets wiped out as all PCs are replaced by mobile devices.<p>(This is the reason I want this to succeed, and I want laptops to be certified FreeBSD compliant.  It matters!)<p>Anyway this is about market positioning, not OSS.  So.<p>Its a well-known truism that don't be in the middle of any market - you get squeezed from both ends.<p>The emerging markets have adapted enormously well to only having SMS and no smartphones (see anyone in Mumbai). That is not going to go away, so the true bottom end of the market is SMS capable devices.  They will probably just give them away.<p>If Firefox OS says we are not as good as iOS then thay are squarely putting themselves in the middle of the market.<p>Aim higher folks.  The world is not segmented into feature phones and smartphones.  It is segmented into one market ""I want to use a networked mobile app to get laid or get cash.""  You will never be the bottom end - that belongs to sending cash by SMS, or selling your harvest with a text.<p>So its the top of the market - what the cool kids have.<p>And so, 1 & 2 might just be our saviours.  Apple made a great new product that was catnip to the coolest kids in the West.  Firefox OS is geeky cool - it might just appeal to the coolest kids not in the West.  And they will want to buy the 'best' phone - aim high folks.<p>I hope you succeed.",1347534380

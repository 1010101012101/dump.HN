Whether it&#x27;s over a billion dollars, or a raise, or a new car, or anything else. The key in most cases is to stop caring so much about what other people think (assuming you&#x27;re not being an overt jerk to spur the resentment). How highly you value someone&#x27;s opinion should roughly match how much you value them as part of your life in general; any misalignment of that, will usually cause suffering.<p>You give it to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.

You don&#x27;t have a good product market fit.  Your product value proposition might even be spot on, but the product itself may fail to fulfill the need.<p>2. You are marketing to the wrong group of people, so while you get traffic your conversions are horrid.  I have seen this when people are using terms or a value proposition that a broad group cares about but only a small sub-group actually purchases or controls the funds.<p>Have you followed up with visitors and figured out why they aren&#x27;t converting?  Have you done trails to get feedback?  Have you done 1 or more surveys to get feedback?  Have you talked to people, called them?  Offered them something small in return for honest feedback?  Have you gone and sat with a potential client and walked them through the product to get feedback?  etc<p>Not sure what your goals are, but I think you have to earn the right to quit so you can learn from the situation.

It would be interesting to see how much, if any, that impacted uber&#x27;s use in areas that should in fact have better (more direct) service.<p>Second item is DUI rates before and after Uber comes to town.  For that matter how much surge pricing happens during major events such as concerts, football games, etc where people may perceive they must drive.  Combine that with congestion data and perhaps uber can propose a partnership with the local metro to pick people up outside of the deepest traffic area by doing a bus/rail hop first.<p>For instance Houston has light rail from our sporting venues to park and ride lots. If you can group people going to the same neighborhood it&#x27;s possible to shift congestion and make the last mile cheaper for riders and more environmentally friendly to boot.<p>You also have major events where really no one should be driving but they are so data is gathered: hurricanes, ice storms, blizzards and so on. In Houston we have regular flooding and it would be interesting to see where reroutes happen due to deep water and it would be very useful to have drivers marking flooded spots so it can be shared back to other drivers via Waze/Google Maps and maybe even CoH fire and police.<p>I could easily see an autonomous car on the side of the road with an led bar in its back window or on its roof warning that water is 12&quot; past this point.

Some even claim that the whole IQ research is not very scientific at all. An IQ test for example is considered good if there is a Gaussian distribution present in the results it produces when applied to a large set of people. However, we still don&#x27;t know if human intelligence is actually Gaussian distributed. The only proof you can find are such IQ tests, which actually are designed with this very pattern in mind. It&#x27;s like asking a question with the answer already in mind.<p>I guess with the creation of phrases like &quot;emotional IQ&quot; and &quot;cognitive IQ&quot; even the research expressed its doubt that those tests can truly hold their promises. Freerk Huisken might be right in the end. He argued that it&#x27;s a logical problem when one is trying to measure intelligence in artificial test as they can not retrieve the true capabilities of a human. Intelligence is a damn complicated subject and although we humans love to measure and categorize everything, we should consider that IQ tests are far from being comparable.

He has always had trouble connecting to people, and no surprise, money doesn&#x27;t fix that. Remove everything else, he&#x27;d be an awesome guy to hang out with and talk about video games, but he wouldn&#x27;t really know how to have a conversation around the typical personalities of this forum, since he isn&#x27;t an entrepreneur by nature. For most of us, all we ever really talk about when meeting other people are: 1) Our own businesses; 2) Their businesses; 3) How we/they/everyone should start a business -- we get absolutely pumped about these topics. That&#x27;s how this guy is with video games, and it makes it difficult to connect to the people who he&#x27;s supposed to hang out with due to the social standing his money has given him. Why? Because the people who have made that much money almost always come from the entrepreneurial mindset, since a business is what usually took them there (or a business on top of their fame).<p>So, I hope Notch will somehow develop an understanding of the world that allows him to become immune to what others think he ought to be and what he ought to do, and instead he just becomes like Wozniak and becomes content with himself. It definitely won&#x27;t happen if he continues to use social media as an outlet, instead of making real human connections that aren&#x27;t focused on partying and spending his money.

Contrary to some of the FUD being posted in this thread, the regulations don&#x27;t appear to be about custom firmware for the UIs or even signalling on a device. They&#x27;re about the control software for the radio itself, to ensure it plays nicely with everyone else. That software is typically extensively tested and certified before being licensed for use, and any supplier whose software didn&#x27;t work properly in the field could expect a very rapid and unsympathetic response from the authorities.<p>What a lot of people fail to understand is how disruptive a radio device that doesn&#x27;t follow the standards can be. I worked for a radio network operator for a while. One day I got into work to find there were widespread reports of radios not operating properly across a major city. Someone was transmitting something out of spec and causing sufficient interference to effectively bring down the whole network. Do you know what happens at that point?<p>This is what happened that day. Real people got into real vehicles and started moving around a search pattern with relatively crude sensors, trying to locate the source of the interference. And then when they found it, they had to figure out how to shut it off. That involved gaining access to premises where the rogue device was located. Ideally you do that with the consent of the residents, because the operator of the rogue device may not even realise that it&#x27;s not behaving correctly. Worst case, you&#x27;re looking at forcing entry, which means bringing in other public services who are allowed to do that sort of thing with the appropriate  authorisations, which in turn have to be sought from the appropriate authorities before anyone can move. And then once you&#x27;ve got into the premises you still have to find the device itself, and then you have to figure out how to turn it off.<p>Contrary to any movies you&#x27;ve seen, this process can take a considerable time, probably at least several hours unless you&#x27;re very lucky. During that time <i>the entire system</i> will be operating at reduced capacity, if at all. Think about the range of a modern cell phone, and consider that any device that can transmit over that range can also interfere with the control channel for any signalling system within its range. Also consider that we&#x27;re talking about changes that might increase the power and therefore the range of the device, or might change the device so it&#x27;s using different frequencies and disrupting other forms of transmission/communication, not just whatever it was designed to work with originally.<p>Bottom line: even one small rogue device on a radio network can cause serious disruption over a wide area, and not all devices covered by these regulations will be small or have relatively low-powered transmitters. Imagine a whole city block or business park where wireless devices didn&#x27;t work all day. Imagine a whole city where mobile/cell phones weren&#x27;t reliable. Imagine a major incident where emergency services couldn&#x27;t communicate properly to co-ordinate their response because their radios didn&#x27;t work, or where the entire response was delayed by several minutes because no-one could find a landline to even call the emergency services in the first place. You get the idea. And just to be clear, this is not some paranoid fear of a hypothetical problem. It actually happens, just fortunately not very often, thanks in large part to the kind of regulatory regime we&#x27;re talking about here.<p>It&#x27;s true that with any sort of government regulation you have limitations on individual freedom. Laws do that, and should never be made lightly. But at the risk of ending on an inflammatory note, consider that while people can hold strong views on whether private individuals should be allowed by law to own and shoot guns, and reasonable people can debate the pros and cons of that, no reasonable person thinks it&#x27;s a good idea for anyone who wants one to be allowed a WMD where they can push a button and kill everyone in a city. There simply aren&#x27;t any good uses for that kind of technology, and the damage one person can cause to others is wildly disproportionate to any personal freedom given up by someone who for some reason wants such a device even though they can never use it. Obviously I&#x27;m not suggesting the threat from a rogue radio transmitter is comparable to the threat from a nuclear bomb, but it really is a significant risk and even potentially a matter of life and death.",1440866104

Ford F150 Raptor is shiny shit, a Jeep Wrangler or an Icon FJ are pretty minimal design, and a subframe and 4 wheels, is just a subframe and 4 wheels. Sure, the letter can get you from point A to point B, but come on, it&#x27;s not a proper car. I would argue that the design on c2.com and the wonderful diatribe of the fellow with a little too many &quot;fucks&quot; in his opus lacks design entirely rather then keeping it minimal, there is a difference.

These could be new companies that grow your wealth, endeavours that seek to create a change that you care about, or doing things to help people that you care about. There are other alternatives, too. Joining investment groups. Taking holidays. Consulting.<p>Problem 2: For chance meetings, I can see how this is a problem, but if you primarily meet new people through existing social circles, that might mitigate this effect a bit. I don&#x27;t have this problem, but I have noticed that I&#x27;ve made lots of great friends through existing friends.<p>Problem 3: Could you not hire someone (or a company) to manage this sort of thing? I realize plenty of oversight would still be prudent, but it should alleviate the stress of it somewhat. Diversity in investments should mitigate the risk of losing everything. Limiting investments to areas that are well understood might also be a good idea for avoiding tax surprises.<p>I agree that wealthy people will definitely still have life problems, but I&#x27;m still not convinced it has to be these ones.

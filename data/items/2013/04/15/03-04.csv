For starters, the title is hyperbolic click bait, and the hyperbole continues. ""The only solution: cut yourself off from news consumption entirely."" Clearly the only choices are inundation and complete isolation. I suppose moderation is one of those ""non-stories"" too boring to report, because it doesn't stimulate the limbic system and get clicks. One clue of intentional irony: ""In a 2001 study two scholars in Canada showed that comprehension declines as the number of hyperlinks in a document increases.""

You can read Wikipedia.  Instead of reading the HN frontpage post about how Sebastian Castro likes having his office in Kendall Square <a href=""http://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2013/04/13/square-still-place-for-start-ups/JcqbMI98Drrb2NG17jH54M/story.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2013/04/13/square-still-...</a> you can read <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendall_Square"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendall_Square</a> and get the history, polysemy, and local attractions of the place  with photos of Kendall Square instead of Sebastian Castro.  Or you could read something on Wikipedia that there will rarely be a news story about, like <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Development_Index"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Development_Index</a> or <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sadhu"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sadhu</a> or <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina%27s_12th_congressional_district"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina%27s_12th_congres...</a>, or never, like <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vis-viva_equation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vis-viva_equation</a>.  And the things you read will be verifiable, objective, and most likely <i>true</i>  unlike the vast majority of crap that passes for journalism today.  And most of what's true will still be true five or ten years from now.<p>But the Grauniad piece is, mostly, not really about how to form a better understanding of the world.  It counsels ignorance: don't learn about the world because it isn't practical (doesn't help you make better decisions affecting your life), stresses you out, is enjoyable like a drug, confirms your pre-existing prejudices due to confirmation bias instead of changing your mind, makes you feel helpless, limits your creativity, and is deeply intertwingled, which ""inhibits thinking"".  Reading the encyclopedia has these same drawbacks!  But I don't believe that ignorance is bliss, that ignorance helps you think clearly, or that ignorance limits your creativity.  Instead, I believe that a broad base of knowledge gives me perspective on our current problems, helps me think more clearly, and enables my creativity.<p>Up to a point.  You can become a mindless factoid junkie from any source of factoids.  Building real knowledge out of facts requires really understanding a subject; as David MacKay says in the preface to ""Information Theory, Inference, and Learning Algorithms"" <a href=""http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/itila/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/itila/</a>, that means you must ""creat[e] it for yourself.""<p>I admit I'm pretty distracted by news items myself, at the moment.<p>(edit: changed ""more or less these conclusions"" to ""some of these conclusions"", which is a lot truer.)",1365997688

An article may be the top story of the day, but that doesn't mean it is important or relevant to me. Clearly there is a ""news cycle"" and every day there must be <i>some</i> top story.

It is a wonderful convenience to have indexing machines working in concert with query engines, allowing the researcher to skip the 300pp of drivel to unearth some crucial paragraph <i>by asking the question in their own words</i>.<p>It troubles me greatly that the solution always is to find a better indexing engine or aggregator (or sharpen one's skills with the software), rather than refining one's own ability to parse sources.

It's not ""rigged"" or ""no competition"" any more than any sort of private property is that way. It's a commons resource, and that's the classical economic approach to handling commons resources: privatize them and sell them, so the market can allocate the resource to the highest-value users. You can't farm in my back yard either--that doesn't mean anything is ""rigged."" It just means that if your farming is higher in economic value than my use of the property, we engage in a market transaction to transfer ownership that moves the resource towards your higher value use.<p>So this is my little pet area of policy, and I think selling spectrum is the wrong way to go.

It was built as a side effort to support the desktop software we were selling as the main line of business.<p>Since we were running on a single desktop, it never occurred to us to think about large server clusters cranking away on data day and night. We just had to make it work on a regular 'ol single machine. Since user experience is paramount in user-facing desktop software, it meant clever algorithms and performant code to get it to process the data in a timely fashion.<p>One day, one of our customers found themselves incredibly dissatisfied with the money and manpower that was being poured into a ""big-data"" data processing solution on another project, 3 FTEs and a half-dozen very expensive servers.<p>On a lark he asked us if our data processing tool could do what their big-data system was doing. As it turned out, functionality-wise, we were about 80% there. With a couple months worth of work we were 95% there. The big question was performance.<p>The customer setup a single instance of our single desktop data processing software and kicked it off. A few days later it had finished. ""It's not fast enough"" he said. So we spent a few months making it faster and getting rid of bottlenecks. We got it down to just a few hours. ""It's not fast enough!"" he said again.<p>So we halved the time...but that was it, it was pretty much all the performance we were ever going to get out of our code-base. We asked ""how long does your big data system take to do what we're doing in a morning?"", fully expecting that their multi-million dollar solution was cranking through the same data in a ten minutes to a half hour or so.<p>He responded, ""two and a half weeks"".<p>A year later, the other solutions provider called us up and asked us if we were interested in purchasing their big-data processing division. We politely declined.<p>The point is that sometimes the giant software stacks and interconnected clustering systems we build to tackle ""big data"" sometimes introduce <i>so</i> much overhead into the system that a single system, running some smart software <i>can</i> outperform the larger systems. We engineers sometimes get incredibly lost in the details of making cool things work to stop and ask ourselves if what we're doing is actually the best approach in the end.",1365996685

This demand usually is discussed in terms of consumer spending, but this is frequently misrepresented by strawmen such as ""Keynesians just thinks reckless spending is the solution to everything"" or ""Keynesians think the way to get out of debt is more debt.""<p>This is false.  For example, it's not contradictory to believe in Keynesian fundamentals and supply-side economics, if you think tax cuts would indeed stimulate private spending to the point of increased tax revenue (which actually did happen when marginal tax rates were cut from 91% to 70% as was done in 1964[0]).  You can also be a Keynesian and believe in a balanced budget, if you think deficits are causing inflation that the Fed needs to keep interest rates high to fight, and thus those high interest rates are suppressing private sector economic activity (as was true in the 1990s[1]).<p>The Great Recession has caused the bizarre circumstance of a liquidity trap[2] -- simply lowering interest rates isn't stimulating economic activity, and inflation is low.  The Keynesian prescriptions for this are unconventional monetary policy (the Fed's ""quantitative easing,"" which can be done because there's little risk of inflation) and government fiscal deficits (to make up for the lack of consumer demand).

The sad thing is not many people are going to read it because it is a lot of true words.<p>I don't think the economic culture of the US bred global business, though. I think the trivialization of the distance did. Glottalization meant that it would be much cheaper for a US based company to enter a fledgling market (say, McDonalds) and reestablish themselves as the market force in that area, since it has a much cheaper barrier to entry than building an entire enterprise from the ground up. The economies of scale grow faster as you approach ludicrously global scale, because you can really streamline all aspects of your business.<p>There isn't really a correlation with global business and competition, either - I'd say global business is only possible when corruption enables rent seeking business (which has no competition and is rigged to the market dominator) OR when there is <i>real</i> competition, and the global business is so successful <i>because</i> of the economies of scale and significantly lower market entry barriers to new regions than a brand new business.<p>So you could have either. We have, sadly, a lot of the first, but the second can happen to.<p>And global business (with competition) is good. It means the competition and economies of scale drive profits to zero, and maximize the benefit to the consumer.<p>The <i>problem</i> with global business is that when our markets and economics are global but our politics and emotions are local, those super companies have significantly more influence than a tiny group of people in an isolated pocket economy artificially cut off by an imaginary line on a map. The global business that truly connect the world extract their clout from the entirety of the species, while a countries politics gets its validation from its people.<p>And <i>no</i> country has a population, GDP, productivity, or workforce, competitive with the global one. <i>Of course</i> they will be corrupted by global business. Their resources are much more limited and restricted, because our politics and cultures are outdated in the face of a modern economy.<p>But this is just one piece of a giant puzzle. Individually, the problems are obvious, stupid, an simple, and often the work of the greedy and corrupt rent seekers. But there are <i>millennias</i> worth of built up greed to lead us to where we are today with the rigged system we work with, and the individual parts complement each other and support one another to maintain the whole broken game. The problem isn't fixing one part, it is figuring out how to remove the tumors before they kill the host, and there are millions of small tumors that add up to a large cancer. And as you chip at the fringes of one, the rest keep on poisoning the system, and they all have to be somehow dealt with.",1365995749

Every other popular web technology at the time was much, much harder to use and slower to develop in.

The keyboard and mouse are under appreciated.  It's really hard to match the following benefits:<p>1)  keyboards are an incredibly fast way to input human language into a computer system.<p>2)  keyboard/mouse operate on flat surface while your arm is at rest.  This makes it easy to use for 8 hours a day.<p>3)  A small movement of a mouse creates a much larger movement on the screen.  Yet, because the mouse is flat and at rest, it is easy to control.<p>4)  Mice are far more precise at pointing than touch screens.

402858,comment,402654,402815,0,0,tstegart,,,"Exactly. I've formulated a theory of micropayment success. It requires:<p>1. A credit card or payment method already in the system, OR, a trustworthy vendor;<p>2. One click ordering or an Ajax style cart where you don't have to load a new webpage for every step of adding things to your cart and checking out.<p>3. Large product base spanning multiple product offerings but only one central payment center.<p>Obviously, this theory was postulated by examining by the most successful micropayment vendor out there, Apple. They're really good at it. Think about it: you don't need to enter your credit card information twice;they have one click purchase; they have multiple product offerings, but all payment goes through them. There is only one person who needs to be trusted, them.<p>I think the one person to trust thing is really the key point. People don't have time to evaluate online vendors for trustworthyness.

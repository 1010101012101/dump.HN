40536,comment,40472,40472,0,0,iamyoohoo,,,"This is a classic case of making a really simple analysis complicated.<p>The reason for age was simple - as you grow up there are more dependencies which demand a share of your time and more responsibilities to live up to - which is what pulls you down. The age question was not about productivity. Given equal circumstances and responsibilities, there is no question that this thesis would hold true - however that is not the case !!<p>Sorry Marc - this time it was thought through a little tooooo much and the original reasons that started this debate were largely ignored. I hope you read this comment.",1186588741

It's very simple and if you run everything through the business there should be some protection.<p>My businesses have been sued several times and I've never worried about my personal liability - and I've never been named in the suit.<p>I guess the real protection comes with insurance, which is the best idea if you are really worried about liability.<p><i></i> I'm not a lawyer.",1186587070

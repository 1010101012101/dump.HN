I don't think I'm better than Peter Norvig; nor do I think Peter Norvig is better than me.  Our interests are too dissimilar for any fair comparison to be made.<p>By ""... or I interviewed him"" I meant in the sense of a journalist or researcher interviewing someone in order to gain information -- in order for me to decide whether I wanted to accept Google's offer, I needed more information about what working at Google Research would mean, and Peter Norvig was the obvious person to provide such information.",1205639821

Just open your resume in a text editor, delete the first three characters in ""ex-programmer"", and your doom will be averted!<p>Even better, open a file in your text editor and type<p><pre><code>  puts ""Hello, World""
</code></pre>
or, for more style points,<p><pre><code>  (setq my-triumphant-return ""Hello, World"")
</code></pre>
and, voila, you're a programmer again. At least by the standards of many job applicants.<p>Of course, by ""ex-programmer"" you may mean ""I used to know how to program, but now the code that our programmers show me is completely opaque and I have no idea what it does or how it works or whether it harbors lots of hidden bugs."" In which case... you are probably doomed! ;)",1205639747

I was able to set up full text indexing/searching in a few hours.<p>The longest part of the process was trying to figure out which versions of Java Lucene and Zend PHP Lucene were compatible.

It is available via SVN in current nightly snapshots.<p>We hope to include Lucene 2.1 index format support in ZF 1.5.0.

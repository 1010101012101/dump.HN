About halfway into the spring semester, my account on the CS department's crusty old Sun box was locked, and my CS professor that semester told me to report to the system administrator's office after class.<p>When I arrived at the system administrator's office, the department's system administrator and the department head were waiting for me.  The sysadmin immediately (and angrily) said that if this were anywhere but a university, he'd see that I was thrown in jail.  When I asked what he was talking about, he turned to his computer, banged on the keyboard for a bit, and turned the massive CRT so I could read it.<p>On his screen was an e-mail I had sent him the semester before asking that he change my shell from /bin/csh to /usr/local/bin/zsh.  (Solaris of that vintage didn't have chsh, so I couldn't do it myself.)<p>The sysadmin was absolutely convinced that zsh gave me ""elevated system privileges"", even though he was the one that changed my passwd entry and presumably was the one who compiled and installed zsh in the first place.<p>When I argued that /usr/local/bin/zsh didn't have the suid or sgid bits and therefore gave me no more access to the system than any other shell, the department head scolded me for arguing with the (experienced, wise) sysadmin.<p>The sysadmin changed my shell back to csh, and the department head made me sign a document stating that I wouldn't change my shell back to zsh or try to ""further gain administrative access"" to the system.<p>On the drive home, I idly wondered whether going to (a different!) college full-time in the fall was really such a hot idea...",1335573429

You'd have to provide ""only"" your ID (CPF) with a pre-paid plan.<p>To be employed at most places, that same info has to be provided, more or less (you don't need to prove income, but you'll probably be required to provide a criminal record).<p>This is probably because of how trustworthy we are perceived to be. Nothing gets done without at least a proof of identity (sometimes, even using check or credit card purchases at regular stores). Not to mention the fact that we are...""advised"" to carry ID papers everywhere, and the police will be somewhat displeased if they decide to take an interest on you and you have nothing with you to prove who you are, even though I am not aware of anything resembling a ""Stop and Identify"" law. I was never asked to provide ID, though. Were I black and poor, my guess is that it would have happened several times already, along with random street searches.<p>All that said, I've never had to provide my passport to anyone, anywhere, except US embassies. Most brazilians are not required or even expected to have one (and is not required when travelling inside Mercosul).",1335571912

How do you back up your claim that beliefs like that will never go away?<p>- True, Rites and practices may indeed help general wellbeing. So does yoga.

We have proofs for when it is and when it is not. Maths is a tool, not a religion.<p>In general, it's impossible to enter a religious argument without specifying your personal position.

Sometimes this is masked somewhat by the fact that the database drivers and/or ORM are slow, so from the application&#x27;s perspective, the &quot;database&quot; is the bottleneck.

The truth is, for a lot of numeric computing, you&#x27;re better off using python, which calls fortran or c code to do the heavy lifting.<p>Fortran can run very fast. If all you need to do is numerical calculations, that might be enough. But that&#x27;s never all you need to do: you need to preprocess your input data, or deserialize it, normalize it, join it or transform it based on some rdbms data, then you do your calculations, and then you need to graph it, serialize it, etc. Most of those tasks are somewhere between excruciating and impossible in fortran, however modern a dialect you use.",1377626281

The integration is kind of subtle if you aren&#x27;t looking for it. Once you realize its there, the whole experience seems revolutionary.<p>I don&#x27;t know if its a direct result, but I could see how this integration yields a lot of benefits. For one, even with the low specs of the Open, things move much faster when compared to a similar specced Gingerbread phone I was using earlier this year. The way that the search works is similarly amazing as the apps load quickly, even without pinning them to the phone. There are also little things, like the fact that you can save animated gifs and have them run in the Gallery viewer.<p>It certainly has a long way to go with some aspects of usability. For one, I have yet to find a way to remove files without connecting to a computer. Navigation could also use some work, as some apps require you to start over instead of providing a &quot;back&quot; button.<p>Considering I bought the phone just to play around, I have been really impressed and can&#x27;t wait to see it grow.",1377626153

6284961,comment,6278047,6284619,2,0,argv_empty,,,"Short answer: No, you can&#x27;t.<p>Long answer: You can, but Haskell is very serious about keeping pure code separate from impure code. Any function which performs I/O is impure, so its output must be an IO Thing instead of just a Thing. This means anything that uses its output must accept an IO Thing instead of an ordinary Thing, and so on. Of course, the way I/O works means that a &#x27;Type1 -> Type2&#x27; function into can be transformed into an &#x27;IO Type1 -> IO Type2&#x27; or a &#x27;Type1 -> IO Type2&#x27; function (this applies to many things other than I/O -- consult one of the many monad tutorials for more on that). Haskell even includes some special syntax for invoking these transformations that makes things look rather like an imperative language, but adding in a debug print still requires you to rewrite a lot more code than you would have to in another language. Alternatively, you could use unsafePerformIO (whose type is &#x27;IO a -> a&#x27;) to hide from the type system the fact that you&#x27;ve done some I/O, but you may run into trouble with the printing not behaving as you expect (due to Haskell&#x27;s lazy evaluation).",1377625489

Rather than write tests for the behaviour we just implemented, or the bug we just fixed, we hit F5. Didn&#x27;t work? Change something, hit F5. This at least isn&#x27;t really Rails&#x27; fault; it&#x27;s our job as programmers to do the professional thing. But it does act as something of a siren call to the rocks of cowboy programming.

To that end, any language without operator overloading is a non-starter, since it&#x27;s far harder to find a bug in:<p>div(add(mult(-1,b),sqrt(sub(pow(b,2),mult(mult(3,a),c)))),mult(2,a))<p>than it is in<p>(-b+sqrt(b^2-3<i>a</i>c))/(2*a)<p>On the other hand, if I wrote server code, operator overloading would be far less useful.  I&#x27;d probably curse any programmer who used it and thank the gods that it was left out of Go.<p>Conversely, since I write a lot of numerical code, I don&#x27;t care about generics or typing, which is crucial to many other programmers.  Generics don&#x27;t matter since everything I work with is either a Double or a collection of Doubles.  Similarly, static typing doesn&#x27;t help, since most functions just have the type (Double -> Double) and the type checker can&#x27;t tell a sine from a logarthim.  Of course, the reverse is also true.  Since everything is either a double or a collection of doubles, the fancy tricks that dynamic languages offer don&#x27;t give me a damn thing, so I&#x27;m extremely ambivalent about the typing debate.<p>Of course, on other projects, I&#x27;ve written code that benefited from static typing and I&#x27;ve written valid code that would choke any type checker.  I&#x27;ve written code that heavily needed generics.  When I did that, I used the languages that had the features I needed.<p>Go just won&#x27;t work for the programs I write and it sounds like it doesn&#x27;t work for yours, either.

I love Scala - It still has its goodiness and it&#x27;s an excellent alternative to Java.<p>If you notice in all of the Scala books (I&#x27;ve read the one by Martin and the One by David Pollak as well), they all seem to push you towards the functional programming model instead of the much more common imperative model.<p>But you know, there&#x27;s a problem with that. Not with the language itself, but with the web development side of Scala. There&#x27;s only certain ways by which you can program with a particular function that accepts a request and returns a response. So, most of the time, I would find myself wasting time thinking &quot;How can I make this more functional?&quot;<p>Functional programming is really great when you can actually enforce it - When writing algorithms and so forth, but otherwise, you are forced to fallback to this imperative model which sucks, because you have to constantly keep changing your mindset between these two models.<p>Another downside of Scala is its HUGE syntax. Processing strings? Here&#x27;s a ten million ways to do it.. (a bit over-exaggerating). Oh and if you chose this way, then you should use this syntax. No, not that one, THIS one. Oh no, not that one, this variation of that one that looks like this.<p>I&#x27;ve advocated Scala to many HN members here in the past, you can even check out my comments, for instance. But from my experience, I think Scala is an Academic language. But it&#x27;s superior in its own ways - I just LOVE the concept of avoiding nulls and passing an Option. It&#x27;s beautiful. But the downside is its huge academic complex syntax. I want to be able to write code which shouldn&#x27;t reduce my hair count even if I look at it after 6 long months. I don&#x27;t want to refer to an 800 page book each time I&#x27;m confused about something.<p>That&#x27;s why I think Go is beautiful. The syntax is just enough to keep it inside your head forever. I fear that as the language matures, this might also evolve into something as complex as Scala, but let&#x27;s hope not so.<p>Go isn&#x27;t a magic bullet though. It has its own downsides, but nothing w.r.t performance or similar. For the most part, it&#x27;s awesome.<p>Once you go Go, you never go back.<p>P.s - I still love Scala as well ;)",1377623991

That is the largest coal producing region in the US and for about 30 years has received massive capital investment. However, coal is on the decline and crude-by-rail is on a massive upswing.

If so, the railroad companies can build that out faster than anyone else, because they&#x27;ve got the rights of way.<p>Incidentally, this is one of the things I don&#x27;t get about Hyperloop versus CHSR: there is nothing inherently cheaper about building an evacuated tube versus putting down a few steel rails. You still need a right of way and grade-separated crossings, and you still need to do all the engineering/environmental work for all that and that&#x27;s where the expense piles up. You think laying some steel track down on a rock bed is the expensive part? Now, once you have the right of way in place, that&#x27;s going to be valuable no matter what technology comes down the pike. Amtrak estimates the cost of upgrading the northeast corridor to 220 mph HSR at $160 billion. A lot of money, to be sure, but imagine what it would cost if there wasn&#x27;t that existing right of way from DC to Boston, through downtown Baltimore, Philadephia, and New York, already in place!

Some of the studies done by TM scientists simply show that some of the same physiological results you can achieve by relaxing completely are achievable by TM. Nevertheless, according to TM advocates, tests have shown that TM produces &quot;neurophysiological signatures that are distinctly different from relaxation and rest &quot;[Judy Stein, personal correspondence]. Critics disagree.* The particular value of these physiological changes one can achieve by meditation have not been shown to be unique to transcendental meditation.<p>EDIT:

So, it pushes a new framework or language every 2 years to keep people hopping around, solving the same problem over and over.

If you keep winnowing down until you give most of the power to one group which the majority of people don&#x27;t mind, they can push through whatever legislation they want with impunity. I would rather have the population represented proportionally by MPs who share their views, so that legislation lives or dies by what proportion of the general populace supports it.<p>As an (extreme) example, you could have parties with different opinions on disjoint issues, like abortion (A) and legalizing marijuana (B). You could then have four parties, AB, A&#x27;B, AB&#x27;, A&#x27;B&#x27;, and some of the populace would vote for each of them based on their support of those issues. If you require that some party &#x27;wins&#x27; and gets a majority, people have to work to rank the parties by least distate, by preferring some issues over others. With a whole bunch of minority parties (ideally 2^n, with n binary issues), every voter could actually encode their whole stance on a set of issues, and bills on that issue would pass or fail proportional to the support of the populace.<p>My point being, FPTP might not be the best at the riding level, but there&#x27;s no reason to mess with which party becomes &#x27;the government&#x27;. The country is well served by the existing Parliamentary system. The Senate, on the other hand...",1377623198

When nerds first read about this stuff we all have the same knee-jerk reaction:  &quot;I write code.  I&#x27;m smart.  I could build a robot trader and make a Walter White pile of cash.&quot;<p>In short, I would recommend you stay the hell away from FX.  It&#x27;s bullshit.  It&#x27;s not like the any type of trading (algorithmic, quantative, manual, good luck charm) you see in stockes.  I do thank the blog author for mentioning that his system never seemed to work long term.  That&#x27;s the key element most people can&#x27;t accept.<p>Here are a few notes from my time in FX:<p>FX is traded on margin, and it&#x27;s easy to lose all your money.  Nearly every single person will lose all their money in FX, and those who claim success are riding a temporary wave.  Even &quot;experts&quot; in the field can&#x27;t hold big gains much more than a few weeks or months at best.<p>A few years back our company bought a trading system we&#x27;d been marketing like crazy and had customers buy into.  Senior management decided to invest a 6-figure sum in this system with the intent of using the profits for employee bonuses.  The day it crashed, not only did we have angry customers but our employees were pretty depressed.<p>FX trading systems are hype.  Always.  You&#x27;ll hear the term &quot;holy grail&quot; in reference to trading strategies.  That should be enough to keep you away.  The real money is made by selling systems to idiots and writing books about it.  As a matter of fact, you&#x27;ll notice a lot of forums and blogs have referral links to brokers ;).<p>A common sentiment I heard tossed around traders and employees goes something like, &quot;rather than trade FX, just go to Vegas and play roulette.  At least you get free beers.&quot;<p>The technology is god-awful.  You&#x27;d be blown away if you saw how shit-tacular the backend is that handles your money.  I thought it was just the place I worked, but nope.<p>The company I worked for is very open and compliant, which I found admirable.  This has continued to be their focus, so that&#x27;s cool.  Many brokers are corrupt, particularly if they&#x27;re not in the US.  Brokers have been caught increasing margins against traders, stop-gapping trades and worse.  In the US the NFA is insane so they do a decent job of regulating, but it seems every year or so they nab a broker on something.  Most NFA fines range in the millions so we took this seriously.<p>I have more war stories, but that&#x27;s enough.  Best advice: do not trade FX.  I realize that may rile some of you, so be it.  I wouldn&#x27;t put my money near that shit.",1377623185

And yes, it is possible to combine event loops with threads in the way you described to get CPU concurrency as well. Whether it is actually helpful depends on the use case. The Phusion Passenger core is evented (similar to Nginx and Node.js) since version 4.0. We considered a multithreaded-evented architecture as well, but it turned out to be less beneficial than we hoped because the applications themselves use plenty of CPU already, and because we rely on shared in-memory state for proper load balancing between processes, thus having a source of contention. In the end, the single-threaded evented architecture in Phusion Passenger turned out to be more than enough.",1377622885

At that rate you can try to trade for an average of pennies per share (including winners and losers).  When an algorithm fizzles, my experience is that it stops making small amounts of money per trade on average and starts losing small amounts of money per trade on average, with more volatility.<p>As you see then, you may automate trading itself, but then your discretion is shifted from deciding what stock to buy or sell short to when to turn on or off an algorithm.  The advantage I suppose is that an algorithm isn&#x27;t necessarily directly tied to market direction.",1377622878

Their idols are often people who brought big news despite govnt opposition.<p>But the common man, the man that has most opportunities to blow a whistle? They don&#x27;t want to be detained at the airport, they don&#x27;t have the protections that journalists do  (like, say, having close journalist friends that can get your story out on the same day).<p>Arresting Miranda does not deter Greenwald, but it might deter other people from following his act.",1377622858

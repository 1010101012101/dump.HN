818548,comment,818484,818484,0,0,bwd2,,,"Exactly what evidence do you use to characterize the loan as predatory?  The other story I've read on this (in the Times as well if I recall correctly) characterized Leibovitz as being bad at managing her finances.  If you pledge property as collateral for a loan and you don't pay the loan back according to the terms that you agreed to, then the creditor has the right to foreclose on the property and sell it, what's predatory about that?",1252724132

818545,comment,818545,818237,0,0,stanleydrew,,,"I actually think you might have an easier time selling something that used to be free. In any case I certainly don't think users are less likely to buy something that was free. If it's free first, users have already seen it so they know what it's worth.<p>You're arguing that there's a set of people who would have been willing to pay for something had they not been given it for free first. But because it was free, all of a sudden they don't want it anymore once it costs money. I think that's a stretch.<p>Also consider joe video-uploader who had never thought of paying for something like analytics, but since he's been using it for free and knows how valuable it is to him he can make a better informed decision as to whether it's worth $10/mo or whatever.",1252723887

Most of their ideas to win back customers were good in spirit but were bogged down by banal details and deceitful trial terms / payment rules. I fully accept the idea that this is just an example of terrible marketing and not representative of marketing as a whole, but I haven't got a personal experience of marketing being a huge boon.<p>I can't say I'm a good example because the end users of my code are company employees, I make internal tools, but even then we try to set our own deadlines and keep them with no external dictation of when stuff must be done.",1252722671

818516,comment,818516,818454,0,0,bokonist,,,"Wow.<p>You complain about me being ""arrogant"" and ""ignorant"" and then you make entirely false statements about my own background (a subject of which you know absolutely nothing).  You then complain about the quality of this forum, and then are the first person in two years of commenting on Hacker News that has ever attacked me ad hominem.  I suspect that you are reasonable person that is just especially frustrated by the generally low quality of internet commentary about economics ( I too no longer visit reddit, but that doesn't mean the people there are wrong about everything).  But if that kind of language is common with you, I do hope that you leave Hacker News.<p>I have had also had a long and deep fascination with economics and public policy.   I've read dozens of books on finance and economics, from the original classics to more modern research.  I've read hundreds of articles, I used to browse through social science libraries and download NBER papers for fun.  I've had long and productive discussions with academic economists, people who work in finance and people who have worked in central banking.    I don't claim to be omniscient about economics.  But I have formed judgments, I state them plainly, and I welcome debate and hearing new arguments.  I do not disagree with Keynesians or other mainstream folks because I am ignorant of their arguments.  I disagree because I have evaluated them very carefully, read everything I could on the subject, and found their theories unconvincing.<p>I would be happy to debate or back up either of the two claims I made ( ""The CPI is not a good measure of inflation"" and ""The mainstream economists led the economy off a cliff"").  If you want to read comments where I elaborate more, you can read a few I made elsewhere: <a href=""http://www.newmogul.com/item?id=15334"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newmogul.com/item?id=15334</a> or <a href=""http://www.newmogul.com/item?id=12274"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newmogul.com/item?id=12274</a>   I would actually really like to debate them with a worthy opponent.  I too find good economic debate very hard to find on the web.",1252721495

your secret weapon in another profession.<p>People who can code in the world of technology companies are a dime a dozen and get no respect. People who can
code in biology, medicine, government, sociology, physics, history, and mathematics are respected and can do amazing
things to advance those disciplines.""<p>Don't know about the programming profession, but the secret weapon bit is true to a degree that might shock many of the readers here. I would even go so far as to say that NOT knowing how to program causes ridiculous waste of resources in other disciplines.<p>Working as an epidemiologist during the H1N1 pandemic, I saw literally dozens of man hours drained on repetitive statistical reporting and database tasks that the average reader here could probably automate in under an hour. There were lots of extremely smart people running around with a ton of important things to do, but since no one (myself included) really knew how to program, what were we to do? I think I was the only one to even have the inkling that we could probably be replaced by a few Excel macros.<p>I don't know this guy's back-story (or why he seems to inspire such antipathy), but this passage got me very excited! I'd already bought into the idea that learning at least the basics of programming would be a good way to improve my general analytic thinking ability (a noble goal, IMHO), but I was being held back by the thought that it was a bit of a frivolous endeavor. This has really inspired me to get started!<p>Secret weapon indeed! Wooo!<p>[EDIT: I see several others have commented on this bit. Sorry to be repetitive!]",1272416013

LLVM does not provide a language runtime, garbage collector, or JIT compiler.  In fact, its principal use right now is as the backend of ahead-of-time compilers like GCC and Clang.<p>What LLVM does provide is a bunch of optimizers that operate on LLVM IR, and a bunch of code generators that take LLVM IR and spit out machine code for different CPUs.  Traditionally these things have been inseparable parts of a larger monolithic codebase (e.g. GCC).

1300335,comment,1299764,1299997,0,0,jdietrich,,,"That is massively, dangerously wrong. Dunning, Kruger and an array of later researchers have shown that while the inept do strongly overestimate their own abilities, the highly able strongly underestimate them. The very able assume that if a task was easy for them it must be easy for everyone, while the completely inept assume that a task seems difficult because it is objectively difficult, and that they must be very able to have made the progress that they did. The lower you estimate your own ability to be, the more likely it is that you are in fact highly able. CF Downing demonstrated that people with high intelligence tend to overestimate the intelligence of people who are similarly intelligent to themselves and underestimate their own. If you think that the people around you are more intelligent than you, you're statistically likely to be the most intelligent person you know.<p>Personally, I think this is a highly pertinent cognitive bias, so pervasive as to affect nearly every aspect of modern life. I think that our most able thinkers keep quiet for fear of being wrong, whilst the stupidest and least informed in our society shout from the rooftops in blissful ignorance. I think that between the natural effect of ""the more you know, the more you realise you don't know"" and the pervasive anti-intellectualism in our society, we are becoming dominated by the loud and inept.<p>In my work as a gambler, I rejoice in this bias, as it is what pays my bills - bad gamblers can't even conceive the idea that there might be skill involved. Unfortunately, I think it is fucking up society - while professional scientists are careful to speak precisely, avoid hyperbole and only make statements that are backed by strong evidence, their opponents feel free to rant and rave, to extrapolate one anecdote into compelling evidence, even to deny the possibility of objectivity.",1272415717

There's no indication that is correct; all I see is a new soon-to-be-sold product that Apple intentionally let off of its campus and into the wild.<p>Second, you presume Gawker criminally misappropriated or otherwise misused the trade secret. Gawker bought a lost phone. Did they have a duty under California law to seek out its owner? Possibly -- but that's an entirely different question from if they criminally violated trade secrets laws. There's no indication that Gawker had any duty at all to protect Apple's secrets; it's not like Gawker is an employee at Apple. You can't just say that, because a person committed a lesser crime, they necessarily committed all greater conceivable crimes. Same goes for the person who found and sold the phone.<p>Third, you presume the government had probable cause to believe that each of the items seized from Chen had information relating to a crime. Two problems with that: (a) as noted above, it's unclear a crime even was committed and (b) the warrant was patently overbroad, and its doubtful the government had more in mind than a fishing expedition. That's a plain violation of the Fourth Amendment.<p>Fourth, where's the fire? There's no on-going crime here. There's no criminal enterprise. There's an isolated, public incident. So why the high priority? Why the extremely aggressive measures of seizing all of a journalists' computers?<p>Compare and contrast that situation to one of the cases listed on the DOJ website you linked to:<p>""In support of his plea, Mitchell acknowledged that on September 5, 2007, he emailed much of the contents of a DuPont proprietary spreadsheet document entitled “Denier Economics” to an official with Kolon. “Denier” is a term used to describe the weight per unit length (linear density) of a continuous filament or yarn. The Denier Economics spreadsheet contained highly sensitive business trade secret information related to DuPont’s production capacity for Kevlar® yarn in a variety of denier types. Included in the information for each denier type were specific figures relating to annual production, unit capacity, spin speeds, and several factors relating to line efficiency (such as percentage yield and percentage up time). The Denier Economics spreadsheet was closely held and distributed to a small number of DuPont personnel on a need-to-know basis only.""<p>Now that's a trade secret, and it's a clear misappropriation of it by someone with a duty to keep it secret.<p>And what did the DOJ do there? Did they start seizing the property of third parties covered by shield laws?<p>No. They slowly started building a case.<p>The exact opposite of what REACT did here.<p>Shoot first, ask later, for high profile crimes is not just the wrong approach, it's unconstitutional and inappropriate.

But, if you project your data into feature space (a higher, possibly infinite dimensional space), a linear separator in that space can be a circle in your original space. Since you can not do explicit computations in an infinite dimensional space, the kernel trick lets you get away without doing them at all. You can thus get an inner product value of two infinite dimensional vectors using a kernel function. So classifiers that only require inner product values and never the explicit vectors can exploit the kernel trick. i.e., SVM, logistic regression, etc.<p>That being said, choosing the appropriate kernel function is not always straightforward for your data.",1272414328

The ones from gnome.org are easier to install, because they send the ""Content-Type: application/x-gnome-theme-package""
 header, while gnome-look.org just does plain ol' gzipped tarballs. (Actually gzip vs. bzip vs. raw tarballs might be up to the uploader, I don't know.) You can also save the theme packages, and drag and drop them in the appearance preferences window.<p>Also, terminology. I think ""theme"" refers to a packaged deal, which can include window borders, gtk controls, icons, colors, desktop background, maybe more. So the frustrating thing you might find is that you see a theme you like, but it changes your colors and gtk controls, and uses an incomplete icon set, when really all you wanted was the window borders. If you install it, you can do something like revert back to the default Ubuntu theme, click ""Customize"", and change the window border to the one installed by the theme. This is is probably easier than trying to customize the new theme itself, especially since if you're used to the Ubuntu theme, you'll probably find that your desired look has more in common with it than the new one you just downloaded.<p>My enhancements are pretty low key. I mute the colors, scale down the font size to 9 to make more use of screen space, and use the SlicknesS window border, which has a smaller footprint than the Human window border.<p>Something else that's mildly frustrating is that the window borders' colors have almost (completely?) nothing to do with the color scheme.

7639177,comment,7638731,7639099,4,0,mcmullen,,,"One of the later episodes of the a16z podcast featured Marc Andreessen and Benedict Evans. They were discussing technology valuations and made some good points. Though I disagreed with their &quot;no bubble&quot; consensus, they were right in mentioning the classic &quot;Russian oil money&quot; and &quot;new players&quot; argument. Previously, most tech investing was done by U.S. venture capitalists. (One of the reasons why non-U.S. start-ups find it hard to fund themselves.)<p>However with multi-billion dollar technology floats like Facebook taking place - many, many people are taking notice and bringing lots of money with them. This, obviously, increases demand which in-turn increases prices. That&#x27;s all. If, or indeed when, the bubble pops and people realise that these businesses aren&#x27;t worth the price paid, I suspect it won&#x27;t lead to the type of crisis that occurred in 00/08 - just lots of rich people with less money.",1398333520

7639165,comment,7638731,7638731,3,0,rexreed,,,"While it is certainly true that valuing a business with an ongoing (and somewhat predictable) revenue stream, the typical yield approach is earnings / purchase price, this is not as applicable in situations where there is either no revenue (such as in the case of Oculus Rift) or little predictable revenue (WhatsApp). What exactly is the yield rate on the Oculus Rift acquisition when earnings are near zero?<p>Much of the acquisition activity that is driving exits, which is in turn driving VC activity (exits motivate investment), is coming from land grabs in expectation of FUTURE potential significant markets. Facebook grabs OR because it believes that the $2B purchase price now will be far outweighed by the potential for VR in the future, same for WhatsApp.<p>It would be simplistic to say that valuations that drive acquisition activity comes simply from comparing yield levels.<p>That being said, where does Facebook get the money to make the acquisitions they do? From the public market. The public market is mostly driven not by individual investors, but by major market movers, which are few in number compared to the &quot;retail&quot; investor market, but significant in influence. And Goldman Sachs and the like might be motivated to keep pushing money into Facebook because the alternatives are weak, given the current low yield environment.<p>If yields improve, then GS and the other market movers might shift from equities to other asset classes (fixed income, equities, maybe even CDOs again), and then as the money stream starts to taper for folks like Facebook, their acquisition activity will slow, and then valuations will start to decrease, and then Venture Capital activities in those sectors will also dampen, because the exits will be seen as less lucrative.<p>It would seem to me that exit activity drives valuation more so than current yields, but current yields might impact the money flow that drives those acquisitions.",1398333108

One is an increasing value of currency, and the other is a decreasing value of currency.<p>People deal with deflation every day - both in their own national economies and internationally - when your currency is rising (gaining value) why would you purchase something today when it is going to be worth more tomorrow?   The answer is because the value of having the thing today is worth more than having the money tomorrow - which is how we base <i>all</i> our purchasing decisions.<p>It&#x27;s true that deflation will have effects that are not good - but mild deflation is no horrific thing.  Most people have been told deflation is a scary monster in the same way that they have been told marijuana is a scary drug.  There are circumstances and reasons when that is true, but it&#x27;s not generally true and generally overblown.  Both high deflation and high inflation are runinous to an economy, but mild deflation and mild inflation just produce different classes of winners - savers vs creditors.",1398333093

Our Sherpas also all have avalanche transceivers so they were able to do a transceiver search as they descended back to BC, but as very few people actually use transceivers on Everest they never found any signals.<p>At that time all our members were at Lobuche BC or acclimatising on the slopes of Lobuche, and only now are they returning to Everest BC.<p>At this stage we do not know if we will be continuing with our expedition or not.<p>Russ&quot;</i>",1398333076

7639101,comment,7638099,7638302,20,0,WildUtah,,,"Those are the official requirements. In real life, only #3 prior art is of any use in disqualifying any software patent.<p>1. Patentable subject matter. The Supreme Court declared that algorithms are not patentable in Benson (1972) and Flook (1978). The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (the patent court) reversed the Supreme Court rulings completely by 1994&#x27;s Alappat decision. Since then, very, very few especially egregious patents are rejected on subject matter grounds.<p>2. Utility is usually trivial to prove. If you&#x27;re using it, it has utility.<p>4. (unmentioned) Invalidity on the basis of obviousness is a dead letter under CAFC precedent. The Supreme Court attempted to revive it in 2007&#x27;s KSR v. teleflex, but the CAFC has overruled the Supreme Court on 35 USC §103 (the obviousness law). You pretty much need a single published public prior reference reciting or clearly suggesting every element in the claim to argue obviousness, which is exactly what you need to argue anticipation under 35 USC §102 (prior art).<p>5. Enablement is assumed to be automatically satisfied in software patent cases by 1997&#x27;s Fonar precedent by the CAFC: \n“As a general rule, where software constitutes part of a best mode of carrying out an invention, description of such a best mode is satisfied by a disclosure of the functions of the software. This is because, normally, writing code for such software is within the skill of the art, not requiring undue experimentation, once its functions have been disclosed.... Thus, flow charts or source code listings are not a requirement for adequately disclosing the functions of software.&quot;<p>Also consider University of Pittsburgh v. Varian (CAFC 2014) where the CAFC decided that 3D computer vision imaging of people and articulated human movement is trivial and obvious post-solution activity that need not even be described or considered part of the claims on a medical imaging patent. The function of human motion detection is entirely covered by mentioning the two steps that particular spots will be tracked and then motion inferred. It&#x27;s literally that bad.<p>If it sounds to you like the CAFC is waging an undeclared war on software, you may be right.",1398331050

Were $10bn valuations possible without public markets before recently? Does that make us daffier if this <i>is</i> a bubble? IE, is this proper risk capital that is less fragile and sensitive to death spirals?<p>Facebook has been aggressively scaling up (in my opinion successfully) their ad business  since the IPO. Facebook has/had 2 big make-or-break risks: (1) losing popularity/users (2) failing to turn users/visits into into ad revenue. There was also some risk that in trying to fix #2, #1 would break.<p>Risk, reward, uncertainty. Nothing unusual here. Risk #1 is constant ambient risk. Risk #2 is/was more of a &quot;what&#x27;s under that rock&quot; risk. The rock is being turned as we speak and so far the news has been good. FB value has roughly doubled in the last 9 months and IMO, that&#x27;s the product of &quot;information&quot; about the viability of facebook as an advertising platform.<p>Here is the subtle point.^ They could have turned that rock just as eerily before IPO. They could have worked on the ad platform sooner or they could have delayed the IPO. I think that move was deliberate. Facebook chose to make that unavoidable, but timeable risky step after the IPO.<p>As an analogy, imagine a widget company. They get investment design & manufacture a warehouse full of widgets. Then they pause, take some more investment, don&#x27;t spend it and go public before finding out if their widgets sell.<p>What role does this pre-IPO money play?

498292,comment,497698,497698,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Reading this, I had one of those -- hey! ""I invented that first!"" entrepreneur moments, since I had blogged on the same topic a week or two ago. <a href=""http://www.whattofix.com/blog/archives/2009/02/who-was-i-again.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.whattofix.com/blog/archives/2009/02/who-was-i-aga...</a><p>Of course, like all big ideas, this stuff is ""in the air"" at a certain point in time and lots of people are channeling it. I think of it as a process sort of like waking up: usually you'll have outliers who warn of problems years or decades ahead of time without any traction, then suddenly everybody's thinking and talking about it. E-commerce was like that, and so it social networking. Who knows? Maybe Twitter is the next big change.<p>This is a society-changing trend, no doubt, and worthy of all the attention we can give it. While my post was overly lyrical, historical, and elliptical -- Bruce drives a truck right through the reader with direct analysis. I hope to see more writers take this on.<p>If I had to put the problem into one semi-poetic line, it would be.<p>Every detail. Easily recorded. Rarely noticed. Never forgotten.<p>Our species has never existed in a world where nothing was forgotten. Not only is the ability to forget a key part of remaining sane, it may be a key part of a functioning society.<p>We don't know -- we're in uncharted territory. But I do know that the matter is credibly huge and will not go away simply by us ignoring it.<p>And no, this is not a privacy issue. To think of it as just privacy is to miss the point. Even if we were the only ones able to access the data about us, <i>is it healthy to have a life in which all the details are remembered forever?</i> I don't think so. This isn't about ownership of the data, it's much more encompassing than that: it's about whether or not people are machines or evolving organisms. Machines don't care for the past. Evolving organisms are always forgetting and remaking the past in order to emotionally move forward. We may be reaching a ""wet-ware limit"" where our information systems are simply operating at too high an efficiency level for the interface to work properly with us sloppy, emotional, forgetful, slow, and illogical hominids.",1235840265

But the fallacy in the comments is that most thought about domestic competitors only.<p>As an example, the French community in Silicon Valley has been wondering for years how to get Paris (or some other city) to start resembling Silicon Valley more. Many French politicians visit for a week and always ask that same question.<p>There could be a critical mass of French people living in Silicon Valley who would love to spend more time in Paris to advise and help the local startup scene, plus some political will to make something happen. Plus some rich American angels would love some special angel visa that would allow them to skip the lines at le Louvre :-)<p>But this plan doesn't address the general lack of positive thinking in Paris.

The anticollege people suggest that college is worthless and (occasionally) the people who go there are similar.<p>The procollege people suggest that people without a degree are lesser or cannot achieve as much because of it.<p>This leads to both sides feeling attacked, and for them to attack back.
What you said is basically true, though. College is a <i>choice</i> which is good for some people, bad for others. Some people excel with the pedagogy, and go far further than they could have on their own. Some subjects require this (or, to turn it around, in some subjects pedagogy is so effective that people without it are at a significant disadvantage). Some, however, do not.<p>Colleges are important and useful. Some people don't need/want that level of analysis. Some people don't need the help. It's a personal decision.",1235838515

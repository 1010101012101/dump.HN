There are many examples. One good example is carbonmade [1] which is a website to showcase professional portfolios (quite &quot;serious stuff&quot; if you ask me). I genuinely wonder where that trend is coming from. Is it because the current generation of engineers grew up watching cartoons? (Just guessing) Or is it because it is a simple way to make difficult stuff appear more friendly?<p>Anyway, I like the design, and I think the designers did a good job.<p>[1] <a href=""https://carbonmade.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://carbonmade.com/</a>",1446760767

I would play with the Telidon kiosk at the local mall, and I think there was also a cable channel broadcasting weather data from Telidon. One problem was it was extremely slow, drawing images at literally 2 polygons per second, so you had to be really patient as it drew, say, a cloud on the weather report. Also, the content on the interactive terminal was pretty uninteresting, stuff like find out about your local government agencies and watch for 20 seconds as it draws their logo. There wasn&#x27;t any cool art like the article describes. While the Telidon concept appealed to me, the actual system was kind of awful and I&#x27;d head down the mall to Radio Shack and hack on a TRS-80 instead.<p>As far as early interactive systems of the 70s/80s, does anyone remember PLATO?

Australia got rid of its carbon tax, and even when it had it it compensated many of the major polluters to shield them from its effects. China announces &quot;targets&quot; that are generally a little worse than what was predicted to happen already -- carbon output peaking in 2030, etc. Canada will make lots of &quot;progressive&quot; noises now Trudeau is in but eventually they&#x27;ll do little to harm the competitiveness of their resources industry.<p>If you&#x27;re going to get carbon taxation, it needs to happen at consumption, because that&#x27;s where you&#x27;re not asking turkeys to vote for Christmas.

That means that they way the population votes, the way the population buys products, has been a directed by the lies of Exxon. We can and we will hold them accountable for those lies and the damage caused.<p>I know it doesn&#x27;t seem that way, but they must have perceived a danger of being sued over climate change (not health, by the way) in order to have taken these actions. I take issue with a society that would ever allow them to be sued for climate change.<p>> Oil is only that important because the industry has actively prevented alternatives from being developed.

IMO, the idea that an audience of image viewers want to fiddle with the light-field knobs themselves (e.g. post-shot focus) is actively hurtful of Lytro&#x27;s products.<p>The holy grail here is a light field camera that obsoletes the need for focus the way that digital cameras have obsoleted the need for color filters used in B&W film photography[1]. Unfortunately, Lytro&#x27;s first product was well before its time.  Their tech didn&#x27;t have adequate still-image resolution compared to even a halfway-decent phone camera, certainly not enough to make the focus vs quality tradeoff make much sense vs conventional cameras.<p>Lytro&#x27;s approach is worth comparing to Apple&#x27;s Live Photos in the iPhone 6s.  Live Photos clearly aren&#x27;t for every shooting situation, but AFAICT, they&#x27;re becoming quite popular for what I&#x27;ll dub &quot;affective photography&quot;: moments of kids, pets, friends, etc.  We&#x27;ll see how well this feature lasts past its novelty phase, but it&#x27;s got a far better hook into what motivates end-users than Lytro has ever had.<p>[1] A quick primer: colored filters were used with black and white film to change the relative contrast of different objects in the scene, e.g. sky vs skin tones vs grass, etc.  A skillful photographer learned to look at the colors in a scene and pick a filter that would produce the desired B&W rendering.  Converting color digital images to B&W allows these rendering decisions to be pushed into post, with more creative freedom than was ever possible with film (or the odd, rare B&W digital sensor).",1446758731

(Of which there are quite a lot.)<p>- Past sexism which impacts income in the modern day.  (Sexism 30 years ago would have impacted starting incomes of people, which would have reflected up til today because one&#x27;s initial compensation greatly impacts future compensation through many different factors.)<p>- Modern day sexism.<p>Given evidence such as looking at just the youngest generation and what they earn, you begin to see women not only equalizing with men in earnings, but out pacing them.  This means that 5 to 7% gap is far more likely to be the first and second.  And once you compare pay gaps to things like danger of the jobs chosen, you see there are many more factors that are hard to account for because people differ so much in how they view the worthiness of these factors.<p>Also some things often aren&#x27;t accounted for.  Consider that many studies looking at the pay gap compare full time work to full time work, not differentiating the difference between 37.5 hours a week (full time in government) and 80 hours a week (or even worse at a startup).  BUT... even in the studies that do try to compare these, they don&#x27;t compare the relevant experience gains (the person working 60 hours a week average will gain 1.5 times the experience of someone working 40 hours a week, to say nothing of the potential differences in those who go home and work on related not-work projects).<p>In short, once you account for all of these and look at those entering the work force, it turns out the pendulum has already swung the other way.<p>On a side note, there are even reports coming out that this may be impacting the dating market due to social pressures on both men and women to pair up in specific patterns (namely that the man should be making no less than the woman that he is dating and that he should be no less educated than her).

10516162,comment,10505476,10515998,0,0,Manishearth,,,"> Most C++ programmers do not fear using references or pointers because of invalidation.<p>Compared to Rust? I doubt that. Like I said, Rust lets you dance near the line.<p>This is from experience in various large C++ codebases. I&#x27;m not saying people use refcounting a lot, I&#x27;m saying it gets used more than Rust.<p>YMMV though, so it does boil down to a matter of different experiences here. We&#x27;ll probably have to agree to disagree.<p>>  In fact it often has false positives requiring borrow gymnastics because it is too primitive.<p>Not really. Aside from non-lexical borrows and a couple other nice-to-have things (but not necessary), the borrow checker is pretty precise for what it tries to prove.<p>One might argue that the guarantees Rust tries to maintain (one writer or multiple readers for a piece of data) are too primitive. I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s true. Doing a context-sensitive/flow-sensitive analysis might lead to more patterns being allowed but it&#x27;s hard to scope guarantees when the analysis is interprocedural -- stopping at function boundaries makes sense to me.<p>> The Rust compiler does not tell you when it&#x27;s impossible to satisfy your problem using borrows.<p>It sort of does. If you try to introduce borrows and listen to the suggestions the compiler gives you, and eventually end up nowhere, it&#x27;s probably not possible to do it that way. It&#x27;s not perfect, but it&#x27;s good enough. And it&#x27;s immune to further changes -- you don&#x27;t need to design your pointer usage so that it&#x27;s future-proof; design it however you want, and if a future refactoring introduces a possible use-after-free, fix the compile error.<p>> And your last line is a complete reversal of your previous attitude: Suddenly you are focusing on theory while ignoring that in practice you can not usually break out `unsafe` to solve your borrow problems.<p>No, it&#x27;s not, I&#x27;m just pointing out the equivalence. My point was that &quot;The things you can prove statically with the borrow checker are a subset of the things that wont trigger UB in C++.&quot; is irrelevant for two reasons -- (a) in practice IMO the things Rust makes you feel safe to do is a superset of what C++ lets you feel safe to do, and (b) if we&#x27;re going to talk about &quot;all possible things C++ theoretically allows you to do&quot;, then you should include unsafe -- you were comparing &quot;safe Rust&quot; with &quot;all C++&quot;, which is unfair here, since the entities to be compared for what you&#x27;re <i>theoretically</i> allowed to do are &quot;all Rust&quot; and &quot;all C++&quot;. I focused on a different flaw in your argument, so of course the focus changed. I&#x27;m not saying you <i>should</i> use unsafe a lot, I&#x27;m saying &quot;what C++ lets you do is equivalent to using unsafe a bit more often in Rust&quot;. I don&#x27;t endorse it, but if you consider &quot;C++ lets you do so many things Rust doesn&#x27;t&quot; to be a plus point of C++ (I don&#x27;t), then you should at least be comparing the right things and allowing yourself to use unsafe in Rust too.<p>> more heavyweight abstractions than necessary<p>Examples?",1446758207

Yes, that&#x27;s what I was accused of when I wrote network drivers at Dolphin and again at SiCortex that some people felt polled too much.

A major focus of the investigation is whether the company adequately warned investors about potential financial risks stemming from society’s need to limit fossil-fuel use.<p>I&#x27;ve always wondered about this. Presumably the people leading big oil companies are not dumb idiots; so why wouldn&#x27;t they take this knowledge and prepare in advance? Exxon could be the leading global provider of renewable energy right now, set to dominate the industry for a century or more. But instead, they are a crumbling company leading a death march of society and their own bank accounts. Why? Why would a big company do this? Is it that really, honestly that hard for people in power to recognize that trying to prevent progress in their industry is exactly what will get them in trouble, lose them all of their money and potentially land them in jail?

10516102,comment,10513305,10515489,0,0,ddingus,,,"One way to help understand this is to evaluate demand and it&#x27;s impact on the overall money supply and value of society.<p>There is near infinite human demand.  Maybe it really is infinite, and that&#x27;s probably a great side discussion.  Let&#x27;s just say it&#x27;s really large.<p>People want and need stuff.  This is a constant.<p>But, there is demand backed by dollars, and demand that isn&#x27;t.<p>Where we don&#x27;t tax in a way that helps to maximize the real dollar demand, we don&#x27;t value ourselves as people well enough to fund our real potential as a developing society, nation, whatever.<p>For our economics to work, we have got to be able to trade on the demand presented to us.  What good are AD driven models delivered to a society with few liquid dollars to make the response to those ADS meaningful?  What good is collecting a bunch of data on people without being able to go back and deliver something meaningful to them and get dollars in return?<p>Some of this can be addressed by making it cheaper to live, thus freeing dollars to fund innovation and reward those who advance us, but there are limits to that, and those limits can be artificially low when people do not have enough to present meaningful demand.  I just read somewhere recently that there is basically nowhere in the US where a person can make it on less than something like $14 / hour.  This varies a little, but it&#x27;s fine for discussion.<p>When they make, say $9, they require external help to meet their basic needs and wants are largely off the table.  We end up using taxes to help them get by, and they are not able to contribute back in a meaningful way.  We can say that they, and their labor isn&#x27;t valued well enough to present a net positive.  They cost us.  They cost themselves.<p>The people making lots of money need to get it from somewhere, right?<p>Our money system is debt based too.  There is as much money as people can borrow realistically.  When people aren&#x27;t valued well enough to present plausible risk, they quite literally can&#x27;t borrow and that means money isn&#x27;t created that would have been otherwise.<p>How the taxes are structured impacts this, as does what we pay them.<p>In a macro sense, the number of people falling into the bucket I&#x27;ll call &quot;tepid to minimal demand&quot;, has risen from some 40 percent of us to a little under 60 percent.  Wages have been flat for a considerable time, and we&#x27;ve also shifted away from new job creation paying &quot;family wages&quot; and more toward service, basic type jobs.  By percentage today, far more basic wage type jobs are created than ones that pay more, in simple terms.<p>This has directly impacted the demand these people can present to the economy as well as their ability to take risk and or fund bigger purchases.  We&#x27;ve innovated too, which means they can get by on less, and that&#x27;s good, but there is a very strong argument for us also leaving a lot of potential on the table by keeping it all as lean as we have.<p>Above a certain point, say $100-200K / annual, gains are steady, and at the top, gains are significant.  For most people, it&#x27;s flat, or for unlucky ones a decline or very significant cut.<p>And here&#x27;s an example:<p>Entertainment dollars, just to pluck one out of the air.  People in the tepid demand brackets typically have what they have for entertainment.  Say it&#x27;s $100 a month, just for grins.  That money gets spent, unless they can&#x27;t for some reason like getting sick or needing to replace / repair something, because entertainment is a basic need and want like food is.  Good food is a want, sufficient food is a need.<p>Buy a DVD, video game, new music album, see a movie, go somewhere for the weekend, buy something for a hobby, etc... all basically compete!  For our growing lower tier of people, which are the majority of people, a big game release may well come at the cost of a couple of movies, or that new toy for the hobby.  Everyone in that niche must advertise and differentiate to maximize their share, and overall growth comes from population growth, and the upper tiers of people.<p>Most notably, the real volume growth is left on the table!  Those people just can&#x27;t do more, so it&#x27;s spent each month, month over month.<p>Now, the common piracy argument is that infringement is equatable to a lost sale!  They say billions are &quot;lost&quot; as opportunity costs due to piracy.  But, the reality is the money coming from these lower tiers is more or less constant, again with very tepid growth due to basic factors, like population, etc...<p>Because we don&#x27;t value people well enough for them to fund entertainment, those billions simply do not exist!  In fact, we find increasingly clever ways to differentiate entertainment and package it in ways that allow for more entertainment choices being possible to more finely divide up the dollars, and give the market some fluidity and the people in that market more choice.<p>Say that the need for entertainment isn&#x27;t matched by dollars.  The overflow is self-entertainment, infringement, trade with friends, etc...<p>If we could somehow prevent infringement, people would simply get less entertainment per dollar, and or overflow would mean they would do other things, if they have time for those other things.  This would force people to really max out their entertainment dollar potential, but that&#x27;s not much.  Some growth would happen, but those billions in lost sales due to competing or infringing entertainment options just aren&#x27;t there.<p>(BTW, this is one argument for the basic income.  Move most labor related dollars into a more disposable / risk friendly spending tier for this lower income bracket.  Basic needs get locked in, and their labor funds luxury or innovation opportunities allowing for some serious and meaningful economic growth.)<p>Take two scenarios then, given this one example.  There are others and they play out in similar ways, but this is long enough already...<p>If we structure taxes to bias toward people who can pay taxes without their meaningful life choices being impacted, that investment can lower the tax burden on those who are impacted.  Say that, results in most people in the &quot;tepid demand&quot; tier ending up with $200 for entertainment!<p>That&#x27;s huge!  Suddenly, there are billions, though realistically that money will compete with a lot of other things, but there really is some additional dollar potential out there for entertainment, just not double.  Infringement may go down, or it may not, and I submit it won&#x27;t matter.  What will matter is more of their demand is backed by real dollars which translates into growth for those at the top supplying and profiting from entertainment.  They now can present more of their wants and needs to the economy as demand backed by dollars.<p>Or, perhaps they can now get some credit, and apply that income to larger or more purchases.  Growth there too.  New money = new growth.<p>The other impact is wages.  When those are higher, and growth can lead to higher wages, the same sorts of dynamics apply.  People end up with more liquid dollars and or credit that they can use to make their demand meaningful.<p>When that demand is meaningful, or maybe actionable is a better word, market effects translate that into growth and innovation opportunities we all benefit from.<p>In simple, human terms, we move people from choices like buying something they want or keeping the lights on.  Those choices are rough, and undesirable on a human level, which is one reason for progressive tax structures.  But the other one is economic.<p>How we compete with other nations, the quality of our infrastructure, education of our people, innovations we can fund, military, etc... depend a lot on how we value ourselves as people and what that value means in terms of real, actionable demand as opposed to costs.  Moving people from presenting as a net cost to a net positive economic contributor to demand is very highly desirable, if we also value growth and a rich market in which to profit from, and as a nation, compete globally with.<p>Getting back to that rich neighbor.  They probably got rich doing business and meeting demand somehow and profiting by doing that.<p>That money comes from real demand presented by people able to present it in the economy.  It&#x27;s longer term foolish to ignore that reality in much the same way it is to say, continue to plant crops and harvest without also returning important nutrients to the ground to avoid it being sucked dry and unable to produce well in the future.",1446757431

7050250,comment,7049668,7050114,3,0,oleganza,,,"Historically, there was never a case when Bitcoin had a stable price and then crashed from it. It was always the other way: everyone who wanted to sell off, did so quickly. Then after 6-8 months of some stable price (in late 2011, mid 2012, late 2012 and mid 2013) new investors saw that it&#x27;s not going down any time soon and started jumping in. The massive increases were also caused by the fact that most people got to learn about Bitcoin during the previous &quot;bubble&quot; and have taken some time to learn about it and wait till the prices stabilizes or starts rising again. There&#x27;s no technical reason to break this pattern yet. On contrary, more and more people learn about Bitcoin and see that it&#x27;s still working as well as 1 or 2 years ago.",1389617944

This doesn&#x27;t just include images, nibs, and other visual data, but also bundled helper tools, XPCServices[1], and additional libraries/frameworks that their framework itself depends on.<p>loose files have this desirable property except for being in a convenient package - including a folder reference or duplicating it as a group in xcode is a drag and drop operation.<p>> One of the features that is possible to achieve with static libraries is the management of symbol visibility.<p>Yeah... loose code files have this /better/ than a library typically does if you like all symbols to be visible. (otherwise its a valid point and lets you hide your code again...)<p>> Dependent Libraries<p>including dependencies is a pain, but it makes sure people can use your code immediately. i like one-step processes - every project i&#x27;ve done in the last 5 years or so works with a single check-out from source control - in some cases even if you are lacking the ide or other important tools. the bloat is not relevant today, even on mobile platforms... although i don&#x27;t seem capable of creating many multiple megabytes of code no matter how much i do except for including some enormous 3rd party library (freetype is the last one i had this problem with - i never use it any more).<p>> result in builds of the library being unique<p>this is a genuine problem - kinda - if your code doesn&#x27;t build under multiple platforms and compilers to have the same behaviour then you have much worse technical debt than this to fix first... like making your code actually cross-platform and deterministic (if you actually need that).<p>however all of that aside I think my point about being super cross platform across *nix, iOS, OS X, Windows RT/Desktop, Android, Windows Phone 8 and unknown future operating systems trumps the lot...<p>EDIT: as a real world example consider stb_image.c - a fantastically useful header providing a very clean image loading interface for the most common formats (especially compared to any of the OS library alternatives on all of the platforms where the amount of boilerplate and needless operations is quite staggering for something so simple). I&#x27;ve used this on all of the above platforms and the only problem I have is that the author is not so keen on using the maximum level of warnings like I do... (I like the compiler to never be confused and have the best information available about my program, and incidentally libraries deny the compiler valuable information in many cases too...)",1389616841

This, however, raises an interesting moral dilemma. In these ecosystems, prior to the disruptor, agents live and thrive. After the disruptor, these agents must adapt or otherwise, be gone.<p>When you think these agents are actually human beings, with issues, dreams and families, a new variable is added to the discussion. Is it OK to disrupt an ecosystem if you find a way to make everything better? Is it moral? You found a better way, so surely it must be implemented, and there are few arguments against that. The agents in the ecosystem had almost all what was needed to find the new way, to enhance their ecosystem: time, experience, imagination. And for one motive or another, they failed to do it. What is their argument when someone else comes along and provides a better solution?<p>I&#x27;m not trying to sound Randian or anything, but I truly believe that &#x27;we have families to feed&#x27; or &#x27;will lose job&#x27; is not a very good argument. Is the ecosystem supposed to be kept in the previous state just for the agenda of a subset of the agents? Under that argument, we shouldn&#x27;t have cars in the first place. Nor bronze age (<a href""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EGAtLGDU7"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EGAtLGDU7M</a>)<p>Is this a testament of the inherent cruelty (cruelty in a poetic way, just as natural selection can be thought of cruel) of the free market, or just a testament of the importance of innovation as a way of survival?

Currently, you&#x27;re structurally guaranteed a substantial follow-on investment on terms which are practically &quot;free money&quot;, and if your startup is not a walking zombie you&#x27;re all but a mortal lock on a seed round at quite possibly the most systematically founder-friendly funding feeding frenzy terms in the Valley.<p>That&#x27;s if you value the actual participation in YC (and later in their mafia) at nothing.

There&#x27;s a reason Paul Graham and YC are the gold standard in these circles now, and that is because Paul Graham and YC are one of the only informed investors in the game. Practically everyone else is just playing a favorable casino game.<p>2) If an investor wants to give you $200k seed money, and you can make a justifiable case that you need $200k to maintain a reasonable lifestyle based on your family&#x27;s needs, then you&#x27;re going to need more than $200k.<p>That said, I don&#x27;t argue that most founders need $200k, I just argue that they should be given reasonable allowances to provide some basic decencies for themselves and their families, instead of ending each pay cycle with less than ten bucks left in their pockets.<p>3) The risk should be appropriate on both sides. If $200k is a risk that jeopardizes the welfare of an investor, he shouldn&#x27;t be investing it; &quot;never invest more than you can afford to lose&quot;. And if taking a job at a startup is a risk that jeopardizes the welfare of a founder and his family, he shouldn&#x27;t be risking it, for the same purpose. A good founder is worth a good salary. He probably shouldn&#x27;t be rolling in the dough, but most investors seem skeptical if the founder isn&#x27;t living off of ramen. This is not acceptable if you have a family to support.<p>What does a VC really lose if a company goes under? Not that much. The founders are pouring years of their life into the development of a product. They are asking their friends and colleagues to trust them to build something great and join them, transferring responsibility for their livelihoods as well. Founders have a legal and moral obligation and fiduciary duty to output the best product possible with their investment. Most founders take this responsibility very seriously. The failure of this venture is a <i>major</i> emotional loss to the founder. And what&#x27;s the loss to the VC? Oh yeah, a rather insignificant portion of their total play, because it was specifically engineered to be that way. In fact, most of them hardly notice when these failures occur, unless they begin to occur en masse.<p>I find the argument &quot;VCs have everything to lose if you don&#x27;t take a 50-70% pay cut!&quot; despicably shallow. VCs <i>never</i> have anything to lose except money, and certainly make sure never to jeopardize that in a serious manner, so what do VCs have to lose? Almost nothing. What does a founder have to lose? Oh, a few years of his life, emotional health and well-being, reputation and trust among his family and friends, etc. Just petty stuff compared to the $200k check an investor will write and instantly forget about.<p>The founder should be made to put even more on the line! He shouldn&#x27;t be allowed a salary that&#x27;s commensurate even with a cruise-control corporate position for all that responsibility. He shouldn&#x27;t even be allowed a salary that will afford him a few basic privileges like a decent mode of transportation, decent living quarters in a decent neighborhood, or a bit of leisure every so often. No income to fiddle with new gadgets or experiment. No room to breathe. On top of the stress of the company, he must endure the stress of barely meting out enough to make his mortgage, which several people rely upon for shelter. He should do all of this because he <i>needs more to lose</i>, so that the VCs are satisfied.<p>The founder&#x27;s only way to make any decent income backported over those years of indentured servitude is to make the VCs a billion dollars first. Seriously. And if anyone doesn&#x27;t like this, then the VCs try to shame him and lecture him about the stakes. Remember how I said VCs depend heavily on the naivety of founders to maximize profits?

9478500,comment,9478071,9478071,0,0,Stratoscope,,,"Morse Code is part of what got me into digital electronics design and then programming.<p>It was in the mid-&#x27;60s in Tempe, Arizona. I was into ham radio (was WA7DUB, now WJ6V) and started out - like everyone in those days - with CW (Continuous Wave, i.e. Morse code). I could send OK with a straight key - the kind when you push it down for the right amount of time to make each &quot;dit&quot; or &quot;dah&quot; (aka dot or dash).<p>That of course got a little tedious, so I bought a &quot;bug&quot; - a semi-automatic keyer where you push a paddle from side to side. One side has a spring mechanism that makes dots in a row until you let go, and the other side simply completes the circuit as long as you hold it that way. So the dots are automatic and you make the dashes manually.<p>Then I heard about &quot;iambic&quot; keyers, where the paddle has two independent levers so can push either lever alone or squeeze them together, and it&#x27;s hooked up to a circuit that makes dots for one lever, dashes for the other, and <i>alternates</i> dots and dashes when you squeeze them both. I bought one of those paddle mechanisms and decided to design my own circuit for it.<p>My neighbor across the street worked at Motorola&#x27;s semiconductor division and was able to get me free samples of their RTL (resistor-transistor logic) ICs. These were pretty primitive - each gate or flip-flop was in its own TO-5 &quot;tin can&quot; package. But they were enough to get me started and I got the whole thing working. It was a lot of fun to design that circuit!<p>Unfortunately, RTL was pretty susceptible to RF interference, and I never shielded the box well enough. This led to some embarrassment when the keyer circuit would start running away with continuous streams of dots or dashes or both, even after I let go of the paddles - and the speed would change on its own too.<p>I remember being on one traffic net where this happened, and the other operators called me a lid and started laughing at my lousy fist. A &quot;lid&quot; is a bad radio operator, and your &quot;fist&quot; is the quality of your Morse code - how precisely (or poorly) you time the dots and dashes.

If you do the same in software, most likely it will stop working. This is because there is much less dependence between sentences in natural language and the dependence is redundantly spread over many pages.<p>> The software elites have turned software into a weapon, a means to dominate and control society.<p>Sounds like a conspiracy theory too me.<p>Judging from the description, I also think the book lacks perspective.

In the article a finance professor is quoted saying “at the current state of knowledge there is no theoretical reason to support the notion that all the growth of the financial sector in the last 40 years has been beneficial to society.”<p>As an example, todays VC environment would look quite different if interest rates were not near 0% and as a result, the products of this environment would also look quite different. Less resources in tech development = less tech development. Now, this is the result of central bank policy printing cash in an attempt to save a recession and spur growth and investors search for yield.<p>But lets think pre 2008 when the majority of the growth of the financial sector was from financial innovation/engineering - IRS, MBS, ABS, the whole option market!, to name a few - the type of growth that the professor is saying is not beneficial to society. Surely this growth also had an impact on our investment in technology through easier credit and better tools for risk mitigation.<p>So this poses two questions:<p>1.

What if he&#x27;s a fresh college grad or a junior developer? I think you&#x27;re coming from a start-up environment where everyone around you is supposed to be an expert in their field. Most Big Cos hire fresh college grads and mentor them. So mistakes like this are common.<p>Now considering he&#x27;s a junior, Remus&#x27;s advice is spot on. I helped a dev on our team in a similar way who went on to write some really complicated distributed systems code that you use today.

In fact, this is one advantage of Chinese, you don&#x27;t need to remember words one by one. Instead, you learn characters, the basic building blocks of word, many of which have its own semantic meanings.Then you can infer the meaning of a &#x27;word&#x27;---a combination of characters on the fly. The core character set is about 3,000, and with that you could read newspaper without too much hassle.<p>>>&quot;I&#x27;ve always wondered how the Chinese language writes loan words&quot;<p>Depends.

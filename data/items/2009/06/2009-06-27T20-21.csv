It wouldn't even be accurate to say that Google doesn't close elements; for example the body and html elements are closed at EOF whether the closing tags are included explicitly or implied.<p>A more accurate headline would have been ""Google leaves out some optional tags, as understood by all browsers and permitted by every HTML specification since the beginning of time"".",1246136361
677166,comment,676978,677076,0,0,thwarted,,,"I think it's worth making a distinction between ""buying"" a new version and ""obtaining"" a new version (where ""buying"" includes software that is charged for, even if you pirate it and don't pay for it).  That is, the difference is between proprietary software and open source software.<p>When I pay money for software, I expect new features.  When I go to download open source software, 9 times out of 10 I want the specific bug I'm dealing with to be fixed (and often it is).  Heh, and often the bug I want fixed is that the software is lacking a certain feature -- but I've seen a lot of ""issues"" and ""bug reports"" listing feature requests, so the feature gets treated like a bug.  Proprietary software is marketed in such a way that the latest version is all that you'll ever need, rarely are its deficiencies mentioned, and they definitely won't be mentioned as actionable ""bugs"".",1246136356

677160,comment,674647,677059,0,0,tetha,,,"I associate relatively light pop with Jackson.<p>In fact, it is quite hard to describe without metaphors. Using metaphors, you can usually say that the music just feels as if someone smashes a heavy hammer against your soul and once the music stops, it pretty much feels like you fall down, as if you were leaning against a wall and someone removed this wall. Music which gives me this hammer -> face-feeling certainly includes, but is not limited to songs by Cryptopsy, Vomitory, Berzerker and to some extent Heaven shall burn and Suicide Silence (examples can be easily found on youtube). If you listen to several songs by these bands, I think my term 'light pop'will certainly become clearer :)",1246135795

677136,comment,676943,676943,0,0,vitovito,,,"Executive summary: Smart kid can't find a direct way to tell faceless companies his smart ideas so they can implement them, so he founds a startup in the vein of Halfbakery, Get Satisfaction or UserVoice where companies can track that sort of thing, and people can write their ideas up.<p>Translation from Bitter Whiz Kid to English: self-important child gets no traction on his resume so starts a web site that he thinks will obviously make the world stampede to his door and he won't have to get a real job.<p>Which is great, because even though this idea is nice, it'll fail because:<p>1. Companies don't want and perhaps even can't legally use unsolicited suggestions.  Despite the ""innovation happens elsewhere"" maxim, <i>no company actually functions that way internally.</i>  If you suggest something and they implement it, do they owe you anything?  Look at all the flak Apple gets when they ""steal"" an idea from a third-party app, whether that's actually ever the case or not.<p>2. The ""innovators"" that founded the company are just as self-important as you are.  It's their company, they know best, their employees know best, who are you?  ""You're just some kid,"" they say.  Start your own company if you don't want to be the low man on the totem pole, which you did.  Atta boy.<p>3. You're still just some kid.  Or, more specifically, despite all your experience compared to your age peers, you're still terribly inexperienced in the ways of the world.  Your entire blog post is a rant against the companies you want to attract to your startup.  You have no diplomacy.  Go read Richard Hamming's ""You and Your Research.""<p>I'm sure a lot of people here at HN were/are in the same boat.  I would actually complain to friends and family, ""Oh, I'm so brilliant, if only someone would just recognize that and pay me money to think neat shit up, I could do that all day.""  I'm pushing 30 and I'd wager my ""experience"" from ten years ago was at least as impressive as his is now.  You know what?  I was a self-important tool.  I did the same things: started a business, did well for a few years, tanked it, did some consulting for a years, tanked that, started another business, tanked that.<p>Then I held two ""real"" jobs with big multinational hardware and software companies, and I think I've grown more as a human being -- able to relate well interpersonally, able to work the system to get my ideas and projects and wants handled, comprehending the value of networking and somewhat being able to do it -- in this time than I did the entire time I was doing my own thing.  I <i>get</i> the system and I think landing my next ""real"" job will be <i>way</i> easier, as will starting my next own business.<p>People told me this when I was this kid's age, too, and I didn't listen, and I didn't get it.  I <i>just barely</i> get it now.<p>Good luck, dejan!  Try and lay off the bitterness a bit and work on your people skills a bit more.  People will always need to see the ""proof"" of your brilliance in the ways they are accustomed to; it's up to you whether fixing that is more important than the ultimate problem you <i>really</i> want to be working on.",1246133723

When you are busy it's hard to look for additional work, so that porpoising (alternating periods of work and idleness) is hard to avoid. I would look to join up with another two to four like minded consultants. This gives you an opportunity to spread out your marketing and sales efforts across the group, take on larger assignments, and have backup in case of illness or other temporary inability to complete the job. Partners also give you time to renew and enhance your skillset--obsolescence of expertise is another business level risk--and others to compare notes with in new or challenging situations.",1246133166

Or perhaps your point is that over-all, Southwest has a better track record than other airlines, to which I must ask, what is the probability that Southwest's spotless record (in terms of deaths) actually indicates that they're safer than the other airlines, and what is the probability that it's just dumb luck?  I would be quite interested in the answer to this question, though it seems airline crashes are both fairly rare, even for airlines with poor safety records.<p>The point is, while I'm certainly not saying that their safety record is meaningless, I think it would be foolish to overlook things such as flying planes which have either failed inspection or which are years overdue to be inspected, especially given the low number of data points in the form of commercial airline crashes.",1246133075

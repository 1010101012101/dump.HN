Wring them mostly out and put them in the freezer.  Wait a few hours and take one out and wrap it around your neck.  The blood flowing through your neck cools down and cools your entire body very well.  The reason for two is to alternate throughout the day.",1211014634

192535,comment,192188,192188,0,0,demallien,,,"Interesting idea, but I think this could be dangerous to extrapolate outside of the target audience (people seeking entrance into university).<p>For example, most recruitment agencies these days use keyword filters on CVs to see if you interest them.  Laundry lists are the obvious response to this.  the more words on your CV, the more likely you are to not get rejected by the dumb computer which doesn't have a 'sidechannel'.<p>Anyway, I'm not sure about the main example given in the article - smart students not raising their hands in class.  I was one of those smart students, and I always put up my hand when asked.  Why?  Because if the teacher asked someone that hadn't understood the material, we would go into a whole long explanation (repeated) of something I had already understood.  Boring!  Move along, get on to some new stuff please!  Teachers of course would stop asking the best students, because teachers want to know (at least at high school) if everyone has understood.<p>And of course, in the real world, if students that know the answer don't raise their hands, it's because it's not considered cool.  They are sending a signal to their peers, not to the teacher.",1211013629

192530,comment,192343,192343,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I'd recommend you not buy your hardware, and instead let someone else be your hardware guy--the competition is so fierce in the hosting industry, and they buy in such huge quantities, that you can't come out cheaper (even if nothing ever goes wrong with your system).  But, if you've got some bandwidth fairy looking out for you, and colo is pretty much free, then I guess you can't resist.<p>But nobody else should be going into the hardware business, if you're building a software company.  Seriously.",1211012718

I've dealt with a lot of Dell systems, and they aren't bad at all.  Get the remote console card, and you'll be pretty well set for emergency problem solving.",1211012542

Also happy there.<p>SoftLayer occasionally has stupidly good deals, if you watch out for them.  Usually on bigger hardware, though, so if you're looking for sub-$100 it's not the place.  But on really big boxes, they have some incredible deals.  We rented a quad core, 4GB RAM box, with 2x250GB drives for under $200/month just a couple of months ago.",1211012446

Hours of film of the mentally tortured game inventor are edited into an 112 minute runtime box office smash, the man having signed away his rights for a small shooting fee, ostensibly for allowing them to document the rise of his sport, gets virtually nothing. In the end our tragic inventor takes his own life several weeks later with a shotgun recently purchased at a pawnshop, none of the hostages were harmed.",1211011759

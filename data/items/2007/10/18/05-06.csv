69548,comment,69273,69273,0,0,catfish,,,"Years ago when Garage.com was starting up, I applied and was rejected. No big deal as I was expecting it, but it did get me a signed rejection letter from the big ""Guy"" himself. <p>As a beta tester it was a very nice gesture, to receive that letter with the comment ""Prove us wrong!"" hand written as a P.S. to the form letter. That letter hangs in a frame and every day I use it to remind myself that the only person that needs to believe in me, is me.<p>Today, many years later, I thank my lucky stars for that rejection. I went it alone, no co-founders, no frigging investor BS, and did not take a dime from anyone. <p>This year the 17 employees of MY privately held company drove our sales to 61 million dollars in online transactions. <p>The satisfaction that comes with proving investors wrong can't be bought, only earned.<p>Those that can, DO. Those that can't, find an investor.<p><p>\n",1192686524

Basically, I would be buying an under-priced PowerPC.<p>I do believe that it is getting harder to think of how to make money on things like that because the set of applications that are (as a whole) processor-bound are getting ever smaller. It seems that everything (except videogames, of course) is either memory-bound or IO-bound.<p>Outside universities, the only people that could be interested in PS3 clusters would be crackers that want to break passwords using brute force.",1192686391

69530,comment,69486,69486,0,0,cstejerean,,,"a couple of years ago I was working as a lab assistant in a university computer lab. Part of my job was to check the printers hourly (in labs on 5 different floors) and see if they needed more paper. Being extremly lazy I wrote a program that would log into the printers web based panel. This panel displayed a paper level indicator as an image. I discovered tgat the image filenames contained the percent full as a number (0, 25, 50, 75, 100). I had my program regularly check all the printers, parse the paper level and alert me if any printer was at 25 or empty.",1192684839

69527,comment,69486,69486,0,0,rglullis,,,"Hum, good one. I have a cool non-hack, actually.<p>In college, I worked for a while in the applied physics department. It was an undergrad research project, where I was supposed to work with parallel systems and cluster architectures. They use software that calculates ""density functional theory total-energy"". Part of my project was to make this piece of software run in multiple machines and speed up the simulations. That used to take days to complete, sometimes weeks, and they wanted to reduce the period of the cycle.<p>I never got to know the whole theory behind the software (I am a Computer Engineer) but I did get to take a look at the manual explaining some of the algorithms, while I was learning more about parallel systems using message passing libraries.<p>\nI was just getting started on the whole ""implement map, reduce, filter, barrier"" using MPI (in Fortran!) when I found a description of the software where it showed how each atom in the strutcture, IIRC, needed to have its plane-wave basis-set calculated. This calculation required a long list of functions and was called for _every_ atom in the structure. Also, the software consisted of long runs of this call, getting more approximate results at each run.<p>Basically, I found an unbelievably parallelizable (is that a word?)  piece of code in a application that was mostly serial.<p>\nLet's just say this: it took me more time to find the place in the code that have the call and even more time to make changes in the Makefile in order to use Intel Fortran Compiler than the time it took me to add 5 lines of MPI code and get the problem solved.<p>When we saw the speedup was directly proportional to the size of the cluster (if we wanted double of the performance, just add the double of computers), I realized that the feat (changing significantly the behavior of an program with so little modification) would be hard to repeat. <p>It was no ""major hack"", but it made me value (a) proper documentation and (b) getting a complete view of the system that I am supposed to work on and modify.<p><p>",1192684677

And before all you 19-year-olds-fresh-out-of-logic-101 scream ""ad hominem!"", let me remind you that in the <i>real</i> world you should always consider the source.<p>I'm not about to defend Java, but what a lot of the Ruby newbies are too young to know is that we <i>had</i> a dynamic language in the enterprise. It was called Visual Basic - you just declared everything ""Variant"". The result was a bunch of god-awful messes.<p>Personally, I like flavors of Lisp. But I don't know that I'd prescribe it for the IT department at Wells Fargo.",1198936676

93471,comment,93413,93413,0,0,pg,,,"I use a 12"" Powerbook that I take everywhere.  I have big displays on each coast that I plug it into when I'm there.  I'm definitely more productive with the big displays, but I've worked for a month using just the laptop itself and it was acceptable. It may help to be using a very succinct language.",1198935727

93467,comment,93349,93422,0,0,pg,,,"Ok, fixed.  If anyone's curious, this bug was an interesting example of what happens when you're simultaneously writing a language and an application.  For a few months I experimented with having a literal return itself when funcalled.  You'd never do this in an ordinary call; the advantage was that it was more convenient to use literals in function-building functions like compose, complement, etc.  <p>I eventually decided this was a bad feature because it concealed so many bugs.  But of course the price of getting rid of something bad for that reason is that all the bugs it had been concealing are exposed.  I caught nearly all of them, but not this one. (For a few hours yesterday morning the comment counts were wrong, but no one seemed to notice.)<p>On the whole, this application has been surprisingly reliable.  We log all runtime errors, and before this it had been weeks since one occurred.",1198934541

But its next two answers were ""Gardner Museum"" and ""Art theft""; no one who ""understood"" the question in any conventional sense would even consider these as answers because they don't make any sense.</i><p>But I think your peek into Watson's inner mind may give you a more insight than you have about the human mind.<p>I'm reminded of a story about how a girl told me she was good at froggy when it came to basketball.  I was like, ""What's froggy"" and she said ""when you get the ball after someone shoots it"".  I said, ""I think its called a rebound"".  And she said, ""that's the word, rebound... but froggy and rebound, they remind me of each other""<p>And your narcolepsy v insomnia example is a mistake I think a lot of humans make.  Like if you ask me which way to turn a lightbulb to remove it, my brain will have both clockwise and counter-clockwise as responses.  And clockwise is probably 80%, but counter clockwise is probably at 20% -- I have been known to accidentally tighten a bolt, rather than loosen it.",1298584714

The fact that two nodes in a social network are likely to both be obese together only shows that obese people move in the same social circles, and there could be a wide variety of social and economic reasons why that are more directly causative than two people knowing each other.<p>Not to be a downer, it just seems to me that this article makes an unfounded leap there.",1298584609

2260009,comment,2257466,2259686,0,0,kerryfalk,,,"""How did you get their contact info?""<p>Sometimes very creatively. First, try the easy path and call the office and ask the receptionist to pass you through. They're VERY skilled at telling you to go away nicely so be polite and get your pitch down to one line to answer this question:<p>""What is this regarding?""<p>""I'd like to talk to them about XYZ""<p>You'll probably be told to take a hike, or ""He's busy, I'll pass along your message."" and you'll never hear from them.  But sometimes you get through so always start there.<p>When/if that doesn't work, guess at their e-mail address. This is actually my personal favourite which I've used successfully - Trade secrets! - and send them an e-mail that explains what you'd like to talk to them about and gives a time that you'll call (Offer them an opportunity to suggest a different time) and make sure you call at the time you specified. Eventually you'll get the address right and you probably won't get a reply but it's crucial that you call at the time you said you would.<p>Then all you have to do is call at that time.  You'll reach the receptionist again and now you have a perfectly acceptable answer to the question ""Is he expecting your call?"".  You can say: ""Yes, I was in touch with him last week and said I'd follow up with him today at this time.""<p>That's all they need to hear and they'll put you through to them. That'll get you in the door, the rest of the selling process still applies. Keep going, never give up, you'll win eventually.  :)",1298584568

Assuming this is the case, it still doesn't prove that you're doing things effectively or that you're creating software that matches requirements.<p>Also, if it is possible to fake out RescueTime by writing a program that sends keystrokes (haven't investigated if RescueTime has put effort into preventing fraud like this) then a developer could just set it up on a VM and then use another VM to surf the web all day and be seen as a ""good developer"".<p>With that stated, it would still probably be a good filter today since to my knowledge there hasn't previously been an incentive to fake out RescueTime data.",1298584541

The guys at (now apparently defunct) starling software seemed to imply on their blog that they were successful starting in Canada and opening a branch in Japan.<p>On the other hand, getting hired is a touch difficult, too. Companies that post at websites like Career Cross are mostly looking for fluency and lots of enterprise experience - I never even had any luck getting a reply. Most companies who are looking to hire foreigners also only want people who already have the right kind of Visa (an Engineering Visa - btw, if you have one, GrouponJP is hiring a PHP+Perl programmer to do some marketing analysis stuff).<p>Things aren't all bad, though. I got my job in Japan by going to one of the Recruit/MyNavi events for Japanese students who had studied in English speaking countries. Recruiters chase down the few foreigners there, but admittedly only one company was actually hiring programmers, and I ultimately wasn't happy there - YMMV.<p>Some video game and consumer electronics companies also hire foreigners, but large companies usually make all applicants take a test that's difficult for native speakers - I applied to Capcom, but they expected me to be fluent and take the test like everyone else. Of course, that depends on the company - you might have more luck elsewhere, and if you're close to fluent, it's worth a shot either way. Try to apply as a ""new college graduate"" if you can - there's a whole lot of bias against anyone who's held a previous full-time position, and I'm sure it doesn't disappear when they look at foreigner's resumes.<p>The other route is through foreign companies - I know at least one person at Google Tokyo who originally interviewed in the U.S. On the other hand, I know someone else at Lockheed Martin who's been fighting to get into their Japan office for years now - so how difficult it is depends on the company.<p>My advice - do Study abroad, JET, or just a 2~3 month trip; go to Tokyo (I personally prefer Osaka, but the jobs are in Tokyo) and go to the HN Tokyo meetup; if no one knows of any openings, apply to a bunch of foreign companies there; if that doesn't work, get a nice black suit and go to a recruiting event.",1298584143

My understanding (which is potentially outdated) is that Angstrom is a collaboration effort between different groups who are trying to combine their separate research into a larger project.<p>For the criticism that the project will ""fail"", I think there's some merit.  Will this produce the next computation system that the world uses?  Probably not.  Will this push the boundaries of engineering and improve on the state of the art?  Almost certainly.  And due to its scale, and the fact that Angstrom was created by combining multiple separate projects, there's also room for individual projects or ideas to succeed even if others don't.<p>My background is that I worked on the FOS project, which is  the part that is most related to the title of this post.

2259938,comment,2259570,2259570,0,0,davidtgoldblatt,,,"Here are the reasons I was disappointed in Watson's showing (despite handily beating the human competitors). The most obvious was that Watson' auto-clicker was a big advantage over human thumbs, so that Watson got 100% of the points for clues to which all competitors knew the answer (if you asked Watson and the two humans ""what's five plus five"", Watson would win, but that's not necessarily proof of any sort of computer superiority).<p>The second reason is that IBM was representing Watson as something of a big push in knowledge representation (I just watched a video where they talk about Watson's ""informed judgments"" about complicated questions for instance). It looks instead like Watson just has an improved ability to disambiguate words relative to previous systems and to do quick lookups that match those words with nearby key terms.<p>For example, on the clue ""Rembrandt's biblical scene 'Storm on the Sea of' this was stolen from a Boston museum in 1990"", Watson correctly answered ""Galilee"". But its next two answers were ""Gardner Museum"" and ""Art theft""; no one who ""understood"" the question in any conventional sense would even consider these as answers because they don't make any sense. Clearly, Watson looked for instances of ""Rembrandt"", ""Storm on the sea of"", ""stolen"", or other phrases from the clue in its text corpus, and found that ""Galilee"", ""Gardner Museum"", and ""art theft"" all frequently occurred when together (because the painting was stolen from the Gardner museum in an instance of art theft), and relatively rarely when not together. ""Galilee"" probably won out of these three because Watson is tuned to Jeopardy clue styles (whenever there is a quoted phrase in a clue followed by the word 'this', it's always asking for the answer that completes the phrase).<p>Similarly, Watson was far less confident on the clue ""You just need a nap!"" You don't have this sleep disorder that can make sufferers nod off while standing up."" It still got the right answer of ""Narcolepsy"", but with a relatively low confidence of 64%. ""Insomnia"" had a confidence of 32% despite clearly being the opposite sort of sleep disorder, and ""deprivation"" appeared at 13%, despite not being a sleep disorder. Here Watson gets confused because the only term of the clue that appears more frequently with ""narcolepsy"" than ""insomnia"" is ""standing up""; my guess is that if ""standing up"" had been replaced by some oddly phrased, uncommonly occurring synonym, Watson wouldn't have been able to come up with an answer, despite the clue conveying exactly the same information.<p>This kind of cleverness is certainly impressive, but it seems like it's an advance in tuning existing techniques to the format of Jeopardy, not an advance that will spark other successful projects down the line. IBM's goal of giving us ""the computer from Star Trek"" doesn't seem any closer; I don't see any evidence that Watson could have answered a question that required more thought or understanding than a simple text search. If there was the question ""how many kings ruled England in between Henry the Fourth and Henry the Eigth"" (8), then Ken and Brad would have been able to answer relatively easily, while my guess is that Watson would be stumped.",1298583154

He had been obsessed with the idea that Deep Junior would never tire. 'The machine is never distracted by an argument with its mother,"" he told me, 'or a lack of sleep.'<p>And in the linked piece Kasparov alludes to the reported next approach IBM wants to take with Watson - support in medicine.<p>Kasparov's human reaction to his encounters with Watson's distant cousins brings up one obvious benefit in the use of technology like Watson for supporting medical decision-making - simply that such software will be less likely to miss something. Software is less likely to miss considering a diagnosis, ordering a crucial test, or following up on a finding - unlike the fallible 'I' who may have skipped a class in med school, or was up all night on call and just can't think straight, or am just occasionally more stupid than usual.<p>Diagnosis is the first thing people think of with technology like this, but in my opinion that's not the big problem Watson should tackle. Medical diagnosis in and of itself (dramatizations like the TV show 'House' notwithstanding), is not really that difficult 99% of the time. When you hear hoofbeats, you're very likely going to find horses and not zebras. A future Dr. Watson might occasionally be very helpful in pointing out very obscure (but uncommon) diagnoses. However, in my opinion the most helpful thing a Dr. Watson could provide is collecting, evaluating, and comparing evidence and outcomes as they are developed globally and locally (ie across broad swaths of medicine, but also within a single physician's own patient population), continuously educating the physician, and monitoring cases.<p>There is plenty of untapped medical data/evidence out there, but it's almost all hidden away in plain sight...text/natural language. I have to agree with Kasparov here, in that the primary advancement Watson represents was in moving farther down the path from syntax to semantics.",1298581833

It's assembly, not C, that runs on your machine, and assembly is not memory safe""<p>There is no confusion of ideas, but I like the Babbage reference :)<p>In Singularity the code is compiled first to CIL, then to x86, x64, or ARM by an AOT (ahead-of-time) compiler. Now here's the thing: the OS loader does not load Assembly code, it loads CIL code, which it then compiles further down to Assembly. Since CIL is verifiably memory safe (like Java bytecode), and assuming the AOT compiler is not buggy, the OS is memory safe. Hence no need for MMU/MPU to do memory protection.<p>So even though you're right that Assembly is not memory safe, the final compiler stage (in this case CIL can be seen as an intermediary language) is implemented in the OS (the loader), and the OS will reject any non-memory safe code. No code that can write outside array boundaries, violates type safety, and attempts pointer arithmetic will be allowed to execute.<p>So no, Singularity does not provide a software layer for memory protection, it's purely an (intermediary) language feature.",1298581794

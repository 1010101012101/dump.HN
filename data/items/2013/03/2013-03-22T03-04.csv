Racism isn't ""the act of saying something bigoted"", it's the acknowledgement of a systemic bias based on a person's skin color. And it doesn't deny that bigotry exists in both directions  it just insists that to focus on bigotry is to miss the deeper issue.<p>This is relevant to this thread, because gender inequality works much the same way. What Adria did was a dick move, and I think her actions were and continue to be rude as hell. But she acts within a greater context of sexism and misogyny in the programming world  hell, in America at large  and to completely disregard how shitty an environment exists for many women is to miss that Adria's behavior stems from a crappy reality. Doesn't make what she did any less inappropriate, perhaps, but it suggests that maybe there are issues here more important than what she did which may be more worth focusing on. I mean, any ills resulting from her behavior have been more than counteracted by the death and rape threats that have been fired her way  she may have started this, but the backlash against her has been obscenely disproportionate.",1363924187

There's also no reason they couldn't have played ball - there's lots of alternative mobile clients for sites like Reddit and Hacker News because they create a healthier community and fill a niche that the creators of those sites can't fulfill.

For a variety of reasons, some cultural, reproduction and child-raising ends up taking more of a woman's time than a man's.<p>It's almost impossible to take 5 years out of the career game and come back in with the standing you had when you left. While that's not sexist <i>per se</i>, it's incredibly fucking inhumane, and happens to inflict more harm on women.<p><i>First off, I can tell you've never been anywhere near a trading floor, or a commercial bank for that matter. The entire industry is based on risk. What do you think trading is? The calculated harnessing of risk. You make bets. That is all. Pure risk. FAR more risky than technology.</i><p>Oh, come on. You really think making $250,000 plus commission is ""risky""? Yes, if you have a bad year and the firm isn't doing well, you might get fired. Here, ""fired"" means you get a shit bonus, and 4 months to find another job, usually a promotion. Yeah, that's risk all right.<p>I know enough about finance to know what I'm talking about here. I'm not denigrating financial professionals. I've worked in a few Wall Street jobs, and liked most of the people. But it's not <i>risky</i> to work there. Risk (with others' funds) is part of the operational calculus but it's not <i>personally</i> risky to be an employee.<p>Sure, there's financial risk (again, with others' money) involved, but you have much bigger risks as a technology founder. Like losing your savings (bootstrapping failure) or risking 3 years of your career on something that turns into a no-name dud. Or you could do a great job, get screwed over by partners or investors or management, get fired with no severance and your stock diluted in some perverse way.

5421247,comment,5420094,5420659,1,0,dalke,,,"Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was put into place precisely because people in a discriminated group would speak out, only to be told that their manner of speaking out was not ""acceptable.""  ""Speaking out"" under Title VII includes picketing, writing letters to customers about the discrimination, and engaging in work slow-downs. These are not acceptable actions to some, but they are legally protected actions and a company cannot fire an employee who carried out one of these actions.<p>Since what she wrote specifically refers to sexual harassment (""Sexual harassment is a form of sex discrimination that violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964"".  ""[It] constitutes sexual harassment when submission to or rejection of this conduct explicitly or implicitly affects an individual's employment, unreasonably interferes with an individual's work performance or creates an intimidating, hostile or offensive work environment"", ""The harasser can be ...  a non-employee."" - EEOC's ""Facts about Sexual Harassment""), it's almost certainly a protected action under Title VII.<p>If so, then while it may not be acceptable to you and various others, it's illegal for her company to fire her because of that action. Assuming I understand the law correctly.<p>To show I'm not just making this up, I'll quote from the judgement in Sumner v. United States Postal Service, 899 F.2d 203 (2d Cir. 1990): In addition to protecting the filing of formal charges of discrimination, Sec. 704(a)'s opposition clause protects as well informal protests of discriminatory employment practices, including making complaints to management, writing critical letters to customers, protesting against discrimination by industry or by society in general, and expressing support of co-workers who have filed formal charges. See Grant v. Hazelett Strip-Casting Corp., 880 F.2d 1564, 1569 (2d Cir.1989), and Schlei & Grossman, Employment Discrimination Law, 548-49 (1983).""<p>See the part about ""protesting against discrimination by industry""? Doesn't that describe this situation almost exactly?<p>Now, if she broke a law, or violated some employee policy in a way that has nothing to do with Title VII nor is some other illegal practice (eg, it's illegal to suddenly fire her for doing personal blogging during company time if her supervisors had long known about that practice and had never given a caution or warning that it was a fireable offense) then that's a different issue. But no one has suggested anything of this sort.<p>So, while you might be offended by what she did, that doesn't mean she ""should have expected what she got"" if that includes that she got fired from her job.",1363923716

The <i>reasons</i> that the guys clam up aren't really the issue at all, and I'm not trying to make claims about whether dick jokes are or should be offensive to anyone.<p>My actual point is that in practice, whatever the reason, guys typically only make those jokes when they consider themselves to be in an environment where such jokes are welcome: what I called a ""male space"". So what does it imply when guys at tech conferences feel comfortable making dick jokes in public? The message that ""this is a male space"" comes across loud and clear to everyone who hears them: men feel a bit more comfortable making off-color jokes of their own, and women feel like outsiders.<p>Again, all of those implications are entirely independent of whether anyone actually finds the jokes themselves offensive, and independent of the <i>reasons</i> that guys typically self-censor. In this case, I rather suspect that Richards herself was <i>not</i> offended by the joke, but <i>was</i> upset that the guys were (unconsciously) sending a ""male space"" message simply by being willing to say it out loud.",1363923607

The clear implication is that they feel like they're in a ""guy space"" where they don't need to stick to more inclusive topics. And that message gets heard loud and clear by everyone around them: men feel a little more comfortable making ""guy jokes"" themselves, and women feel a little more like outsiders.<p>[I was tempted to build a whole analogy based on the question, ""Sure, and don't you think your sports-fan friend would feel uncomfortably out of place at PAX?""

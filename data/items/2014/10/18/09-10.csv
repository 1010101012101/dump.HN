Then the Dockerfile for the final application is `FROM me/myjava` and just does a few things that don&#x27;t use the network like `ADD . /code`.<p>- Use `docker commit` instead of Dockerfiles for those steps (pretty gross IMO)<p>- Use CM in your docker build to install a very specific version of a package if you need (I&#x27;m not 100% sure this exists but it seems probable). This isn&#x27;t perfect but tightens things up if you&#x27;re worried about upstream breaking apt packages etc.&quot;<p>These are some of the goals of ShutIt.<p>We had complex development needs due to technical debt, and dockerfiles simply didn&#x27;t cut it, and I got frustrated with the indirection of chef/puppet/ansible. I also needed the several hundred devs in my company to get productive quickly, so transferring all the little bash scripts and storing it in docker was the path of least resistance.<p>It&#x27;s out of date and heavily edited, but I talk about this here:<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/ianmiell"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/ianmiell</a><p>and here:<p><a href=""http://ianmiell.github.io/shutit/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ianmiell.github.io/shutit/</a><p>and on my blog:<p><a href=""http://zwischenzugs.wordpress.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://zwischenzugs.wordpress.com/</a>",1413626391

The setup itself is working reasonably well, but most autoconf scripts don&#x27;t work well with cross-compilers, so it&#x27;s not workable for pkgsrc right now (though it is workable for my own C software).

8475026,comment,8474032,8474968,0,0,vinceguidry,,,"I&#x27;ve heard this advocated a lot, but I find it hard to do in the case where you really don&#x27;t want to leave your company, but do need to correct your salary. Because it requires engaging with other companies on less than good faith that you&#x27;re really motivated to jump to another job. Sure, if you&#x27;re a sociopath, this won&#x27;t be a problem for you.<p>As someone in this exact position, my solution was to ask for a raise, and when they said no, I considered trying to make a quick move. But after realizing that I really don&#x27;t want to job hunt right this moment, I put my head down and went back to work.<p>I think in order to get to that point in your career where you can easily have multiple competing offers to choose from, you need to be a really good developer with a spiffy-looking portfolio. Takes time to get there, and beating the bushes to get offers just doesn&#x27;t appeal to me, and probably won&#x27;t until I&#x27;ve fine-tuned my development process to where I can whip up websites like no tomorrow. My job is Good Enough for the moment, yours might be too if you think about it.<p>Oh and parent comment presented his opinion as a TL:DR of the OP, when in fact it&#x27;s just his opinion.

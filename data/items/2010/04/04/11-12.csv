1240054,comment,1239599,1239864,0,0,kurtosis,,,"I've heard this said many times - that in the U.S. there is less of a ""stigma"" against founding a company that happens to not work out (for any number of reasons).  Can anyone here give examples of how this stigma is more severe in non-U.S. countries?  Is it that no investor will ever give money to anyone who has so much as touched an unsuccessful business? Or are there more subtle social factors at work? (i.e. people stop being your friend if your business doesn't work out) I'd really like to hear some stories about how failure was more severely stigmatized that in the U.S. especially in countries that have much stronger ""safety nets"" than the USA",1270382369
1240053,comment,1240026,1240026,0,0,alex1,,,"UX is a science and visual design is an art. I think they are both equally important.<p>The UX guy is like an architect, but even if he comes up with a nice building layout, no one wants to live in wood and cement foundation. UX and visual design go hand-in-hand and both are needed to create something compelling. In web design, collaboration between the UX guy and visual designer is very important, as the things they do are equally important.",1270382247

In that light, I'll update my advice:<p>At the end, if you think ""they didn't mean to, but I'm still offended"" then you should take the appropriate action.",1270382186

Lead by example.<p>If Greenpeace and the rest of their ilk care enough, they should lead by example - announce that they'll no longer use cars, telephones, computers, heaters, air conditioners, or anything that was made by a process that also created pollution. No email, no internet, nothing more than riding on horseback to drop a letter made on hand made paper off. I think that would be good for them as an organization and good for the rest of the world.",1270382157
1240050,comment,1239812,1239812,0,0,voidpointer,,,"I think, when trying to help someone, asking for more context is a good thing. The examples that are given in the article are often things that arguably sound a bit more complicated than necessary (writing a windows app in assembly). Thus, the question is a valid way to establish a bit of context and by no means an implicit denial of the validity of what is being asked. ""Because I want to know how it works"" or ""because I have reason to believe it is the only way it will work/be fast enough"" are good replies and the whole thing leads on to a nice discussion (No not an exchange of tweets, a real discussion!)",1270382088
1240049,comment,1239950,1239973,0,0,nekopa,,,"Interesting link, that is the kind of stuff I'm looking for.<p>Yes, organizing is crucial. I am basically trying to do the collecting and repeating recursively. All of the various projects I have set up use a fair amount of similar ""chunks"", but in slightly different contexts, so I hope to have built in the repetition, but in an interesting way. The overall organizing I am still working on, as I am putting the finishing touches on the 'syllabus' I am going through. It looks as though I will have to write some custom software to do it, which is kind of good news in a way, because by doing that I will also work on areas which I am studying, i.e. data visualization. Thanks for the link",1270382025

Most RISC architectures have been made more CISCy, and vice \nversa.<p>The article mentions CISC CPUs using RISC instructions internally, which isn't the whole story anymore.<p>Ars Technica did a classic article on this debate (in 1999!): <a href=""http://arstechnica.com/cpu/4q99/risc-cisc/rvc-1.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arstechnica.com/cpu/4q99/risc-cisc/rvc-1.html</a> and a follow up here: <a href=""http://arstechnica.com/hardware/news/2009/09/retrospect-and-prospect-ten-years-of-risc-vs-cisc.ars/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arstechnica.com/hardware/news/2009/09/retrospect-and-...</a><p>A particularly interesting part of the follow up:\n""But a funny thing happened with the Pentium M: processor designers discovered that processors of all types are actually more power-efficient if their internal instruction format is more complex, compound, and varied than it is with simple, atomic RISC operations ... ... The end result is that even RISC processors needed to get more CISC-y on the inside if they wanted to juggle the largest number of in-flight instructions using the least amount of power.""",1270381507

Cooking from scratch is time consuming.  It's easier to develop those skills if you have the traditional nuclear family thing going where one person is the primary cook and it's easier to come up with the time when you don't spend an hour or more every day just driving to and from work.  (Generally speaking, even if your commute takes just as much time, taking the bus/train takes less mental and physical energy out of you than driving does.)",1270380809

1240038,comment,1239094,1239675,0,0,hga,,,"Obviously, C# and a good part of the the .NET libraries are Microsoft's attempt to do a better Java, with Anders Hejlsberg leading the effort AND trying to fix some Java mistakes while he and his team were at it.<p>As far as I'm concerned that's just fine, competition is a <i>good</i> thing.  Also note that this happened shortly before progress in the Java language became glacial and sometimes dysfunctional.<p>(Also note that Java was hardly original when it came out; being able to do that in a useful way has become exceedingly difficult now that we're in the 5th decade of high level language design.  If you disagree, please point out say half a dozen things in Java that had never been seen before in the lab or industry.)<p>However note my comment ""most especially the CLR [is a great idea]"".  This is where Microsoft can in theory win on the technology side of things.  E.g. F#, their dialect of OCaml.  Indeed it's ""<i>just copying what other folks are doing</i>"", but it <i>is</i> the first functional language with major vendor support, right?<p>You can do functional programming on the JVM with e.g. Scala and Clojure, but the JVM runtime is not exactly going to go out of its way to help you (that's actually scheduled for the upcoming new version of the JVM).<p>My bottom line is that focusing on C# rather misses the point when Microsoft from the very beginning made such an effort at a multi-language system.<p>Your points about vendor lock-in are of course well taken, although I'd say Microsoft's abandonment of backwards compatibility with VB6 -> VB.NET is a <i>lot</i> worse.  There's a difference between the old ""IBM will take care of you"" and Microsoft's untrustworthiness if you play the game by their rules.",1270380249

The front of the books has tips like ""Read just before bedtime"" and talks about why the book is organized the way it is (for maximum memorability).  They have illustrations and witty, engaging and generally interesting.<p>A quick google turns up the title ""Head First"" and I think that is the name of these books.

I like to see what an app is going to look like before I sign up.<p>Your logo looks weird to me, like it was created in one of those automatic 'cool text logo' websites. Get someone to make you a nice logo.<p>Your features list is a bit too long. Make it three or four fantastic benefits of your service, e.g.:<p>* Optimize your landing pages<p>* Increase conversion rates<p>* 1 minute install<p>And kick the '100 free recordings' bit to the pricing/plans page.<p>Finally, just a question rather than a comment on the landing page: how do you compare to crazyegg.com, the obvious competitor?<p>PS. Your plans could do with a bit of work too. Make it MY local currency, for a start. Also, your top-end plan is stingy. You're charging 199 EUR a month - let them use it on as many damn websites as they like! And store it indefinitely! Is disk space expensive? No. Top-end plans are for businesses who have plenty of money and want the absolute top end service. Plus, what is a 'recording'? It's not obviously clear unless I already understand your service. Perhaps you could say 'unique visitor', for example.",1270378837

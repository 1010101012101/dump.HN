This leads to the smart kid inevitably getting their chops busted for being ""uppity"" by the very teacher who gave them responsibility but then denies them authority or power and punishes them for presuming those things went together.  However, the other students also draw the same conclusion as the gifted ""peer tutor"" and resent the perceived power of this child and also resent what they believe is ""teacher's pet"" status.  So the peer tutor is getting hostility from all sides.  Meanwhile, their own intellectual need for new information and new learning is being ignored and neglected.  This is a great recipe for creating trouble, what with idle hands being the devil's workshop.<p>Ultimate result:  A tortuously bored student getting hostility from the teacher they are trying to help and also from the other students they are trying to help.  Should this kid grow up into a ""socially awkward geek"", no one ever stops and wonders how much of a role negative social experiences played in making them that way.

For example, all the page titles here start with the string ""Hacker News | "", which is completely redundant given the favicon, and could just as well go at the end of the title. As things stand now, my tabs seldom show more than the first three or four characters of the actual article title.",1256000458

Titles are then the only way to identify the pages (plus, much of the time, favicons).<p>And in that context I also do not agree with the suggestion in the article. Displaying only on which page you are currently will be good enough much of the time but not always. Finding a (short!) way of denoting which website you are on seems sensible to me.<p>Now, honestly, this doesn’t apply to the page he mentions. You could indeed cut the BBC out. “Doctor Who” becomes the important information – but that identifier should definitely be preserved. Now, having titles like “Contact” or “<Title of Article>” – that would be a bad idea.",1256000437

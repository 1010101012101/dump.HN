6344797,comment,6344610,6344610,5,0,pilif,,,"<i>>Many web services choose to return dates in something other than a unix timestamp (unfortunately)</i><p>Wrong. That&#x27;s very fortunate. Unix time stamps have some serious deficiencies as data type for storing time information: for one, they lack precision. One second just might not do it. Then they lack any time zone information. You will never know what a specific time stamp is in. GMT? UTC? Time zone where the server is in?<p>Sure. Maybe you are lucky and it&#x27;s documented (it probably isn&#x27;t because people who care about such things are not using unix time stamps to begin with), but using a string time stamp formatted in ISO means that no documentation is needed. The encoding is good enough to store any sub second time stamp including time zone info.<p>That way, you can turn any of these into whatever your environment uses internally which you will then use in conjunction with the library routines to deal with all the difficulties related to doing math with dates (how many days in a month? What about leap years? What about time zones? Not really hard issues, but many to keep in mind and many possible causes for bugs)",1378555118

Rotavirus is evaluated at 1% of children deaths in these countries [1] (from CDC, a source you mention yourself). Will you also push for a vaccine for the 99 other percent?</i><p>Where to start with this?<p>45% is a pretty low effectiveness rate. I&#x27;d prefer to see it higher, but nevertheless 45% success should improve herd immunity, right?<p><i>Rotavirus is evaluated at 1% of children deaths in these countries</i><p>If that is correct, then that is a <i>HUGE</i> death rate. Anything to reduce that seems sensible.<p><i>Will you also push for a vaccine for the 99 other percent?</i><p>Well.. can you predict in advance which are the 1% who are going to die? If you can then vaccinate them! If not then it would seem sensible to vaccinate everyone to develop her immunity. That will (a) directly decrease the death rate by making some who would have died immune, and (b) indirectly decrease the death rate by making it less likely to be transmitted.<p>Edit: Reading a bit, I believe your numbers are incorrect - or at least the way you have phrased it. 1% may be the rate in <i>developing</i> countries, but it isn&#x27;t in developed countries.<p>The Wikipedia article on Rotavirus[1] makes the vaccine seem pretty compelling: <i>In Mexico, which in 2006 was among the first countries in the world to introduce rotavirus vaccine, diarrhoeal disease death rates dropped during the 2009 rotavirus season by more than 65 percent among children age two and under.....In the United States, rotavirus vaccination since 2006 has led to drops in rotavirus-related hospitalizations by as much as 86 percent. The vaccines may also have prevented illness in non-vaccinated children by limiting the number of circulating infections.</i><p>So yes, in my opinion - based on 10 minutes of research only - it should be mandatory.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotavirus#Prevention"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotavirus#Prevention</a>",1378554954

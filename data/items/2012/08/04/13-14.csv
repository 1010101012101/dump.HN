My view of venture capitalists (VCs) is that they don't look at ideas, or big ideas, or the anything at all detailed about a proposal from an entrepreneur.  So, if VCs don't bother even to look at ideas, then it's tough to believe that they are<p>""up in the arms""<p>about what they don't see!<p>Of course, the author gave no list of his ""many"" VCs!  I, however, have a long list of VCs who, receiving a proposal for a ""big idea"", e.g., along the lines of a company worth $200 billion, just quit reading and, maybe, start laughing.  My list is long enough that the author's ""Many"" becomes improbable!<p>Instead, I've long since concluded that VCs look at a few simple criteria and then, for their first serious effort, in one word, look at 'traction'.  Given some significant traction, all the rest is nearly irrelevant.<p>In one step more detail, the VCs have no serious methodology for evaluating anything about a proposal except just traction.

A change request to restart a server takes 4-weeks and is turned down by a CTO who doesn't understand IT needs. The CTO implements a new policy without discussion with IT which renders a passion project by members of the company to be scrapped.<p>Startups are corporations. They work just like one. Sure they offer perks like free pop, food, paid lunches, breaks, naptime, pool table, ping pong table and so on. This isn't a management style, its a employee benefit.<p>When it comes to management, startup companies seem to approach business in the same way. A CEO who has the CTO/CFO/CIO reporting to them. Then there is someone else who reports to someone else who reports to someone else. It's a cycle of killing ideas. If one person doesn't like the idea somewhere along that chain, probably at the top somewhere, it won't get any  traction.

In that first year you will show value and if you don't the rest of your employees will tune you out. Another thing is their hiring procedures are probably much better than an organization. Instead of having HR and then a manager from the department for hiring or a selected individual it's probably more spread out and allows all employees to interview new employees to see if they would fit their teams.<p>[i]Every form of business organization needs people with a vision to set its model and its goals and to direct people and resources in a way that maximizes the opportunities of successfully reaching those goals.

It reads like a laundry list of gripes the author has, like ""oh yeah, and one more thing, and look at this word, and what a fool this guy is, and one more, and and and"" but with some nice verbage.<p>What he doesn't get to the heart of is, aside from the fact that the book may not be very good (which I can easily accept), why the  central systems-and-data-driven plank that comprises much of TED-esque thinking is bad.<p>To take one example, he seems to find the whole notion of a hybrid age, or the singularity, as dangerous technocratic political thinking, something to be stamped out. Whereas look at the actual smart-device search-engine semantic-social world we're creeping toward and the post-political person understands that those are just inevitable outcomes. It's not whether the singularity might happen (or could be prevented) but when, and so the forward-looking thinking person should be trying to figure out the best uses of that.<p>He's also missed the pointed examples of Signapore and China by a country mile, mistaking older ideological associations (which, again, every forward-thinking person understands need to be resolved) for the efficiency argument. The reviewer's point is that efficiency leads to brutality, which is a very old-school political idea, but the TED-esque view generally looks for efficiency to promote/empower humanity.<p>Again, like Wikipedia, both more efficient and much better (but let's instead get distracted by talking about Jimmy Wales and how he named his children).<p>So, you know, like that. Morozov seems to want to make a middle-20th century argument about early 21st-century ideas, and it shows.

Suppose your profit margin is Y. Then for every $(1+Y) your workers spent, you earned $Y. I.e., you get back $XY/(1+Y) < $X.<p>So no, it's always better for the bottom line (holding all else equal) to pay your workers less. You might be able to attract better quality workers by paying more, or perhaps you can cook up incentive plans to get workers to work harder (both of these are what Henry Ford did, for example). But that has nothing whatsoever to do with workers buying your products.",1344087012

You make another 4(?) folders in my home-directory and call that reducing clutter?</i><p>I can see a clear and very useful difference between RUNTIME_DIR, CACHE_DIR, and CONFIG_DIR. Consider a scenario where $HOME is on a networked filesystem. RUNTIME_DIR <i>has</i> to be outside that, and local to the machine's namespace. That's because it references things inherently local to the machine. That is, pids and pipes. These wouldn't make sense on any other machine and will just make the application's job harder.<p>I also set CACHE_DIR to be local (/tmp/$USER.cache.) That's because caching performs terribly when it's flying over the network. Chrome is the main culprit for me. It also fills my file quota with hours of using it. However, it's still useful to keep that data in the medium term.<p>CONFIG_DIR and DATA_DIR, however, don't seem to be very different to me. I can't imagine a scenario where I want one but not the other. I might be using the wrong sort of applications. (For the record I have 8 files in .config, 10 dot files, and just 1 in .local/share.)<p><i>Due to the semantics you now suddenly need a cronjob or similar abomination that traverses all home-directories and picks out stuff (""MUST"" be blown away).</i><p>Having RUNTIME_DIR on a tmpfs, like what most distributions do with /var/run, solves that problem. I map mine to /var/run/$user, even though I've yet to see an application actually use it. The spec BTW doesn't even specify the default value!<p><i>And what the heck is going in .local anyways? When the user saves a file then he pretty surely doesn't want it buried under some dot-directory.</i><p>I agree, the default values are silly. This, like most of Modern Unix, is an ugly hack which makes dealing with the rest of the ugly hacks a bit easier. If you want an elegant solution you'll probably have to throw away most of what was added during last 20 years. May I suggest starting with sockets?",1344086444

4338373,comment,4333774,4333774,6,0,michaelochurch,,,"There is a reasoning behind emails like the first: managerial mystique. Make decisions, don't explain why. If you explain your reasoning, there's room for debate.<p>You don't want to explicitly say, ""Because I say so"", because that's drawing attention to the fact that you're being a dick. The stuffy and bureaucratic language is a part of that. It's about seeming official. The ""bad"" first email is classic 20th-century management done well.<p>Like this:<p>TO: All employees [1]<p>After careful consideration [2], we [3] have decided to review [4] the work-from-home privilege [5] that we offer. While we intend [6] to continue extending this plan [7], we expect that employees will monitor their individual performance [8] while doing so. For that reason, we've attached form TPS-363 [9], which all [10] employees are expected to submit to their managers should they continue to use the work-from-home privilege. [5]<p>Footnotes:<p>[1] Aggressive formality. This isn't ""Hey Team"". It's serious business. Management is alert. The Man is on patrol.<p>[2] ""Careful consideration"" means, ""We're saying upfront that we don't want to hear any complaints or dissent. We're representing ourselves as having deliberated <i>already</i> in an attempt to shut out any room for debate.""<p>[3] Use ""we"" to communicate bad news. The ""we"" is a move to speak for the company so it sounds like you're ruling based on leadership rather than authority. ""The company"" (not just an anal-retentive manager) needs this.<p>[4] ""Review"". This makes it sound like there was a process and (again) a deliberation.<p>[5] Note the use of the word ""privilege"", subtly implying, ""we can take this away"".<p>[6] ""We intend"" = ""We're being nice by letting WFH continue, but don't make us regret it.""<p>[7] ""Plan"". Working from home is no longer something the company offers to improve productivity and morale, nor is it a perk. It's a ""plan"". And plans have rules.<p>[8] ""Individual performance"". Scary words that suggest more managerial oversight and possibly ""reviews"", ""performance improvement plans"", and terminations. Good employees never, ever have ""performance"" under discussion. Good employees (and managers who know they have good employees) discuss the <i>impact</i> they've had and would like to have in the future. They discuss goals and lessons and aspirations. When the discussion is of ""performance"", it's inherently a negative one. The stars don't need performance reviews to know they're doing well. Performance reviews are to scare the people in the middle and to document the reason for firing those at the bottom.<p>[9] The longer the form, the more there is a message of, ""We'd actually rather not that you do this, but if you're willing to feel like you're applying for a hand-out by filling out this form, go ahead.""<p>[10] Note the use of ""all"". That's most important. It makes the change seem uniform and fair, and applied across the whole company. This allows people to conclude, after a bit of annoying news, ""Well, if my boss has to do it, and so does his boss, and so does his boss, it can't be <i>that</i> bad"". Of course, the <i>reality</i> is that people in the managerial hierarchy (and grunts with supportive managers) can ignore TPS-363 and no one will bat an eye, but the change <i>appears</i> impersonal.<p>This is a ""bad"", morale-damaging email, but it's 20th-century bureaucracy done about as well as it can be. How so? Well, in a mid-20th century context, people are already used to annoying, paternalistic memos from ""on high"" and have developed an immunity to them. They know that companies gradually get worse, but that the process is generally quite slow. What it actually is is a dog-whistle. The actual targets (WFH employees perceived to be slacking off) of the memo are warned, but the rest of the employees forget it 15 minutes after it was sent. Do people actually quit their jobs after an irritating email? No. People grumble about them and then forget. They get back to work, and people who enjoy the work they're doing are going to annoy irritating upper management unless it directly affects them.<p>The difference between 20th-century bureaucratic management and 21st-century movement in the post-managerial direction (cf. Valve) is the change in the motivation-payoff curve. If a highly motivated employee is only 25% more effective than a typically motivated (i.e. wanting promotions and not to be fired) employee, then irking a highly motivated one to warn a slacker is worth doing. If that discrepancy is 5x to 10x instead of 1.25x, the calculus is completely different: you're actually better off taking a hands-off approach and letting employees self-organize (and quietly managing slackers out if they fail to find a place after a year). We're coming into a world where a company can <i>only</i> be competitive if its people are highly motivated, and traditional Theory-X bureaucracy just doesn't work.",1344085910

I have no ties to UCF other than having come in contact with several of their ""graduates"" and I would be surprised if anyone else with a quality education didn't also get the same impression that UCF is nothing more than a Phoenix grade program.

The shuttle was almost certainly less safe than its statistics indicate. If every launch delay of more than one day were considered a failure the shuttle's success rate would be very poor indeed.<p>Another question is how safety statistics are calculated. E.g. The overall safety of cars, measured by deaths per passenger mile, say, reflects many things, not just the engineering of cars themselves (in like manner, NASA's cautious use of the shuttle did much to ameliorate its excessively fraught design). On the other hand, crash safety ratings are prospective -- a five star crash rating won't save you colliding with a semi trailer, driving off a cliff, or into a lake, or having an accident at 120mph, or having your fuel tank explode.<p>There was an interesting discussion of actual car safety per model in the New Yorker a few years back, with the Toyota Avalon on top, and the VW Jetta second.

Almost everyone has a smart phone these days and smart phones usually support push notification, which makes any messaging as integrated as receiving sms messages.<p>SMS is an archaic system with costs kept artificially high by telecom operators, there's no way around that except for doing your stuff over the internet.",1344085272

It's (trying to be) beyond that, about technology and science and understanding, and while the result is often pretty technocratic it is actually often reflecting the benefits of self-organisation through tech. Stuff like Wikipedia, for example, is perfect TED-fodder because it shows demonstrable ways of doing things better.<p>People who do not understand that idea (of which they are many) criticise it on their own terms, and so miss the point. If you are used to seeing life through a political lens (as we might hazard the New Republic does) then TED looks like an agenda by a different name. However that's like religious people insisting that atheists must believe in <i>something</i>, even if that's belief in an idea. It is outside their framework of understanding to consider a person who does not hold any kind of belief.<p>So, personally (and I think the popularity of TED and RSA etc reflect this) this whole article reads like some venting from someone who doesn't really understand the concept, and so can only think of it in terms of politics. These Teddites must have a political view of <i>some kind</i>, right? No.<p>It's trans-political because it's about applied informational learning to solve problems. Politics itself being one of those problems.",1344085241

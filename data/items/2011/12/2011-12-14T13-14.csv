Like Java has shown, how good the language is seems secondary to how good the implementation, the runtime, is.<p>JavaScript runtimes have kept on improving and with the V8/Node.JS combination have started taking over the server-side code.<p>With careful engineering, developers can get even further with just JavaScript the language. I wonder for instance whether using the Google Closure Tools can bring more gains there. Such tools help with checking the code for common pitfalls and the style guidelines also help a bunch. Plus, they might help with deployment, with the packaging for the specific program you've written so you don't need to package up all the library with it. Then you don't need to feel ashamed of making use of lots of library code, if only the part of it that you're using gets deployed.<p>Still, working with JavaScript directly can also bring debugging challenges, even more when you're trying to debug code that has been mangled since leaving your library source files.<p>Languages like CoffeeScript and Dart have success because the alternative in pure JavaScript is still quite painful, as I've mentioned above. It's a mistake to dismiss languages like CoffeeScript and Dart because you want that 50% extra performance.<p>Still, CoffeeScript is a concept. It could be said to have been over-engineered in places.

But first, that little guy faces a big challenge: how to get himself noticed. How to turn himself into a Radiohead without the tens (hundreds?) of millions of dollars that EMI spent marketing and promoting and touring Radiohead, over 20-odd years, prior to the band's online release of ""In Rainbows."" How to turn himself into a Louis C.K. without two major HBO series deals, a bevy of TV roles, sponsored tours, and a movie role or two.<p>In looking at the majorly successful artists in pop culture today, we see that 99.99% of them were ""made"" by a big company or series of big companies. They were self-made in the sense that they quietly worked in the trenches, perfecting their craft, sometimes for decades, before they hit their big breaks. But big breaks were necessary conditions of becoming superstars. And becoming a superstar seems to be a necessary condition for big success in this model.<p>[I don't want to get onto too wild of a tangent, and start discussing the philosophical meaning of ""success.""

I sent emails to ~50 different companies (some well-known, others unknown) that were looking for ""Sr. Developers"", particularly Ruby devs, as found on the major developer job sites (stackoverflow, Dice, Indeed, 37signals etc). I mainly targeted companies that were potentially/maybe/sorta/kinda/probably/possibly able to accomodate some form of telecommuting/remoting. I also picked companies that most closely matched my skillset. In my email I introduced myself and included my resume. Here is how I am represented in the email (paraphrased from actual text, ):<p>Given: X > 7 & Y > 4,<p>""Sr. Level Developer, with X years exp. Y years of prof exp with Ruby.

You don't read or dont respond to emails!!<p>How can 40/50 companies or their recruiters not even respond to an email at all? Why heavily advertise a position only to not follow through! 
LESSON: Check the email box for resumes<p>2. You allow for big time gaps in your hiring process<p>The hiring process at some of the companies that contacted me was just strange. One day they ask me ""when can we setup an interview?"", so I respond right away. 4-5 days later they get back saying ""Ok how about next week?"". LESSON: Long delays in communication make me lose confidence in the process/the seriousness of your interest etc.<p>3. Weird extra steps<p>Some companies like to send riddle/puzzles/challenges etc, which is fine with me. This might be a barrier to some people that think its absurd. What does it prove? That your team spends lunch break browsing trickyriddles.com?  LESSON: riddle/puzzles/challenges might seem cool to you but might just seem like another hoop to me.<p>4. A cultural mismatch<p>""Xbox's PS3 Nerf guns Starcraft/Rock band competitions !!!"" - Nothing against any of that, but as married father of two, I have other concerns (what no ping pong table?) like ""Compensation, Opportunity for Advancement, Great Benefits, Fast Growing, Opportunities to contribute/architect etc"". If you think of ""Xbox's PS3 Nerf guns Starcraft/Rock band competitions !!!"" is an applicant deterrent, then I agree with your strategy. LESSON: not all programmers/developers fit the fold you are presenting, many of us are unique!!!<p>5. You dont hire telecommuters/remotes even if you say you do<p>This has been talked about ad nauseum...<p>Other potential reasons: Administrative snafus, HR general laziness, what HR?, the site's down, I want too much money, your company has a bad reputation, others?<p>So after 60 days I am still looking ;) but based on my simple research project, 80% of companies claiming to need developers are either nonserious or are too busy to even start the hiring process.<p>I know, this research project is flawed and anecdotal but maybe it can help you rethink/iron out any bugs in your hiring process. If you can't find talent, my guess is that you are probably failing in one or more areas above.<p>EDIT: Formatting",1323869029

From reading the article, one gets the sense that there's already been a very vibrant aftermarket for these papers to date. From an initial selling price of ""a couple thousand dollars"" in 1994, they've risen in value to $1.6MM. Assuming the original price was $2000, that's a 79,900% increase in value in 17 years. (For the sake of comparison: the price of Apple stock has increased by about 921% between December 12, 1994 and today).<p>Memorabilia, antiques, and artifacts -- even the seemingly random ones -- can be extremely lucrative investments. True, there isn't always an obvious aftermarket; many of these items are purchased as curiosities or personal bragging tokens. But if one is able to create an aftermarket for them, the sky is the limit.<p>Who would purchase these papers from Mr. Cisneros at a sum higher than $1.6MM? It's tough to say, but I can see quite a few possibilities. Other rich guys, museums, charitable foundations, corporations, and hell, maybe even Apple itself. Maybe Woz gets sentimental one day, can't find his own copies, or decides he wants more copies, and buys them from this guy. Who knows? There are a lot of potential buyers.",1323868514

3351663,comment,3348383,3350378,1,0,Nrsolis,,,"Thanks for posting this.<p>I got started in standup about 10 years ago and went from doing 2-minutes at an open mic to MC at the DC Improv for Robert Schimmel in something like 4 years.  That's 4 years of getting on stage every chance I got and trying to write material that was funny and current.  It gets old quick.  When it came time to make a decision about comedy (which I loved then and still do), it became more about opportunity cost (as you put it) and lifestyle factors.  My next move was to go out on the road and to be honest, that life just didn't appeal to me.  Add in the stress of dealing with club managers, never having enough money, and circulating among other comics with various levels of personal disfunction and addiction issues and I opted for a ""boring"" life in tech.<p>Show business is a tough life and it's the rare individual who can make a go at it and find success enough to have a ""normal"" life.  My observation has been that the stress of the performer career/lifestyle leads to substance abuse faster than almost any other career choice outside of high finance.<p>The next time you see a comedian performing in a comedy club, consider this: unless he's the headline act, he probably made something like $50-$75-$150 for his performances for the entire night depending on how long he was on stage.  If that sounds good for 20 or 30 minutes of ""work"", figure out how much time was spent travelling and writing material before you do your final calculation.  Nobody gets rich off of middle money.",1323868308

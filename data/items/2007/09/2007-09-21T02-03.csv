The app ended up coming out really good, but I'm not sure what to with it. Ideas so far are to open-source it, maybe write a django tutorial based on it, or just host it and target it at some group that doesn't have a social news site yet and could use one (I can't think of any, can you?)<p>What should I do? Ideas?",1190343107

57778,comment,57314,57623,0,0,alex_c,,,"""enterprise software HAS to work""<p>That's where the author (and myself) disagree, I guess.  Enterprise software SHOULD work, but there's no reason to believe that it does any better than other software.<p>The moral of the story for me is to test everything before it gets put in production (wasn't Groovy brand-new in 2004?)  There's no reason to assume open-source software works, and there's no reason to assume enterprise software works.  Even if it's used by hundreds of thousands of businesses with no problems, there might still be a problem with your specific setup, whether it's open-source or enterprise.",1190343011

If a state airline does that, you have a good state airline.  If a private airline does that, you have a good private airline.  In theory, a strong private sector ensures that firms that don't do this are replaced by firms that do, but frictional costs in the aviation business are so large that this often takes decades.

57770,comment,57687,57687,0,0,Goladus,,,"If I had one recommendation, it would be to keep practicing any math you learn while in college.  If you're like me, you basically had math classes every semester from when you were 6 years old until the end of college, and you take for granted how much you will be able to forget in 5 years without practice.<p>The classes I got the most out of aren't the ones I'd necessarily recommend.  Whether I got a lot out of a class depended on lot on what the rest of my schedule looked like at the time (besides variables like professor and class makeup).  If I was taking 12 credits, I'd tend to get a lot out of all of them.  If I was taking 18 plus being a treasurer of a singing group and planning a trip to Europe, I wouldn't learn as much.<p>Sometimes, I'd get a lot of knowledge out of a class, but the perspective and wisdom wouldn't come until later.  I learned how to write a fugue in '18th century counterpoint.'  Like the Zelda one on this page:<p><a href=""http://www.goladus.com/music/musicpage.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.goladus.com/music/musicpage.php</a><p>But it wasn't until I'd been out of college a few years that I figured out how to write a coherent piece that was longer than a minute or so (not counting fugues, which I could still write if I wanted to).<p>Here's some more:  <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/gadolus"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.myspace.com/gadolus</a><p>As you can see I really have no idea how to promote music.  That might be something I'd recommend a music major learn about.<p>Others, like Theory of Computation, I loved but because I didn't find any use for it in the first few years after college, I forgot a lot.  I still get the basic concepts of nondeterminism and context-free grammars and such, but I'm having to basically relearn all the useful stuff.",1190341011

57768,comment,57714,57763,0,0,uuilly,,,"Depends.  Here is a case where it wasn't:<p>-Israelis recruit a DOD employee(Jonathan Pollard) to spy for them during the Cold War.<p>-He tells them how to crack our naval codes.  <p>-They sell the codes to the Russians in exchange for Jewish Ukrainian refugees.  <p>Israel is a democracy and the Arabs in Israel are reproducing faster than the Jews in Israel.  So if they want to continue to be ""The Jewish State"" they need immigrants to keep the majority.

Make sure that it has 3n the volume of the rice and water that you put in. Rice will expand 2n. Just to be safe have a 3n bowl. Add water like you regularly add. Put it in the microwave for 25-30 minutes depending on your rice. I live on rice and beans and this is how I make mine. This is a lot less messier than a rice cooker.

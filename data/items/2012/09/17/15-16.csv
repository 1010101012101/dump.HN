4533158,comment,4533083,4533083,1,0,verdverm,,,"I haven't actually connected the front and back yet, but the big idea is Symbolic Regression. The process flow is as follows: Buoys get put in lakes and collect high resolution data. We don't really have the tools yet to understand what the data is telling us outside of the basic ecological theory. One avenue for greater understanding is to uncover the differential equations that are driving the system. In comes symbolic regression(SR), a means of deriving equations directly from observational data. Much like (non)linear regression, we want to model the data. SR searches both equation form and coefficients for fitting a data set.<p>This is meant to be the user interface to my master's research. I am developing a deterministic algorithm for SR that outperforms the Genetic Programming method. I want to take it one step further and have humans and computers working together to find equations or in general data mine.",1347897554

Because of my location, I had the opportunity to work for many former executives of large companies; our zip code has one of the highest densities of former-CEOs in the nation. One of my customers was/is the former CEO of a pharmaceutical company that you'd find in the top 3 of the largest pharmaceutical companies in existence. I've become close (closer than one would expect for a ""IT tech"" relationship) with their family. We spend time talking about plenty of things that aren't computer related, so about a year ago, I was shocked to hear that he has Alzheimer's.<p>He is one of the most down-to-earth, most open-minded, most generous people I've ever met. I genuinely count him as one of the greatest people I've ever met. As you can imagine, he is well-liked and very well-connected in the medical industry. Guess where he's getting treatment? Not in the US.<p>So here is a man with more money than he could ever spend in a lifetime, and more connections than any average person has, yet he has to go outside the US to get ""cutting edge"" treatment for a disease that is far from a fringe case.<p>I recognize that this is just an anecdote, but it is a superlative one to be sure. His case is an amalgamation of every factor that one would believe could lead to a positive result within the healthcare system we have here in the US, yet that goal has not been reached. If you can't look at that example and recognize that what we have here is broken, then I don't know what to tell you.",1347897515
4533152,comment,4532754,4532754,1,0,vyrotek,,,"Looks interesting! There was a period of my life not too long ago where my friends and I would buy a new board game every month for a while. I love learning new game mechanics. But, I've never really played Pen & Paper games before and don't understand their appeal in this age of technology. Heck, I get frustrated with how manual and tedious regular board games are these days. Digital versions of games are so much better and move faster. How many times have you played a game and then half way through you realize you forgot some important rule or have been adding some points up wrong? I imagine what keeps players interested in this is that the game rules and content are all generated by the players?<p>Personally, I get over my frustrations and enjoy board games mostly for the in-person/face-to-face interactions. I guess my point is that this all seems a bit backwards. It seems they've digitized the human interactions and kept the games manual? I still hope for a future where it will be common to play games on things such as Microsoft PixelSense [1] (formally known as Surface). Or if everyone I knew would hurry up and buy a tablet then we could have some even more interesting games evolve.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/pixelsense/default.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/pixelsense/default.aspx</a>",1347897506

If that's all the agency recs are doing, they're not adding value""<p>Exactly. I still don't understand (after 9 years of being in industry and consulting the last 5) why it is too much for a hiring manager to spend some time himeself to vet a candidate esepcially if they will be critical to the team,project and company's success. As much as I hate to work with thetse agency recruiters, the underlying issue is not them. The issue is the employers who depend on these recruiters even though they rant about how bad the quality is etc.<p>Employers: it is simple. To hire the best, you need to do a lot more than asking agency/vendors to send u resumes/cvs. Interview your recruiter first. Test them if they know and understand what and who you really need. Just saying ""PHP developer"" doesn't cut it. Provide more specifics. Any good candidate will be more inclined to talk to you.",1347897434

Currently it is just a wall of text and buzz words.<p>* You should make TWO separate landing pages. One for students and one for mentors. Make the student page 100% student oriented and designed differently -- more fun. Add a button ""Are you a mentor? Click Here"". The mentor page will be the more professional one.<p>* That girl can easily pass as a college student/working professional. HS'ers are very groupy and very fun oriented. You should put a group photo up there or something. Example (www.andover.edu). See how much more fun it immediately feels?",1347896876

4533087,comment,4521192,4531413,1,0,pdonis,,,"> You're not getting gold, you're restoring fairness where the rule or law is unfair.<p>But how do you know what's fair? More to the point, how do you know what all the other people, whom you're supposed to treat the way they themselves would like to be treated, think is fair? You've assumed that cheating on an exam which you believe to be unrelated to the course material is ""fair""; how do you know all the other people who are affected by your action would agree?<p>Also, I probably should have made it clearer at the outset that judging that something is ""unfair"" to you is highly subjective and prone to error. I do not really believe that the exams the Harvard students cheated on were ""unfair""; I think the students were just too lazy to learn the material and then tried to weasel out of the consequences. But they themselves probably sincerely believe that the exam was unfair and unrelated to the course. The fact that so much was at stake makes their judgment that the exam was unfair quite different from, for example, my judgment that I know better than the people who put up speed limit signs what a ""safe"" speed is under the current driving conditions. See further comments below.<p>> You get the gold by leveraging your renewed equal opportunity.<p>Cheating doesn't give you ""equal"" opportunity; it gives you an extra opportunity that the people who don't cheat don't have. Whether that is actually ""fair"" is, as I said above, highly subjective, and it's very easy to judge wrongly if you have a strong personal stake in the outcome. That's why we have ethical norms that don't allow people to make such judgments unilaterally in cases where self-serving judgments are highly likely and have large consequences.<p>Since I asked for a principle that distinguishes when it's OK to ""cheat"" and when it isn't, I should offer one of my own--actually two, following on from the above comments. I see at least two key differences between, for example, the case of exceeding speed limits, and the case of cheating on exams:<p>(1) I can make a good case that I, driving my car on a particular road under particular conditions, can better judge what a safe speed is in that situation than lawmakers or regulators who just have very general rules for setting speed limits: I am there and they are not, and I'm the one who risks injury if I have an accident. So I have more information and am motivated to make good judgments. The case of students cheating on exams is opposite in these respects: the students do not have more information than the professor does, and they are highly motivated to make self-serving judgments about whether the exam is ""fair"", rather than accurate ones.<p>(2) I gain no significant advantage over other drivers from speeding. I get where I'm going faster than I otherwise would, but that does not hinder any other driver from getting where they're going. There's no competitive element involved. In the case of students cheating on exams, there certainly <i>is</i> a competitive element; a student who cheats does not just gain an advantage, he takes away an advantage from others.<p>So I would distinguish ""cheating"" that should be prohibited from infractions like speeding, by these two principles: the motivation for self-serving judgments, and the competitive element where one person gaining an advantage means others lose it.<p>> The Golden Rule doesn't only demand that you treat others that way; it also demands that others treat you that way, which may require action on your part.<p>I'm not sure the Golden Rule includes this, but that's an argument about terminology, not ethics. Basically, you're saying that you have to let other people know how you want to be treated. I agree with that general principle, but I'm not sure cheating accomplishes that purpose. Are the students who cheated at Harvard being treated more like they wanted to be treated because they cheated?",1347896797

Every company uses recruiters, figure out who they are using and get in the door with them first.  find out how many people they have placed at said company.  If they havent placed anyone there then you probably don't have that big of a chance.  However, if they have placed someone there before, then try to get some inside info as to what the managers are looking for.<p>Hiring managers are more likely to give feedback to recruitment managers than directly to the candidate.  Candidates tend to get emotional when told they don't have the position.  No one wants to deal with that.<p>Another thing to do is to work with a professional tech resume writer.

The problem is with shitty encoders and shitty software that was all written during the late 80s and early 90s then never touched and improved since.<p>It seems all the GIF encoders out there just take the easiest way out. GIF itself (from what little studying I've done of the spec) isn't such a terrible ""codec"" to work with, and it has features comparable to basic, decent video codecs. It <i>has</i> the potential to be decent (color space issues aside). The problem is with the crappy-ass encoders that take the laziest approach possible, rendering each frame separately, literally not cross-optimizing <i>anything</i>, applying random dithering in hopes it'll look OK on the pathetic monitors that were the best the 80s had to offer, and trying to do it all with as little RAM and CPU time as possible with no regard for searching for similarities across frames and finding ways to optimize the results appropriately.<p>There's no reason a good GIF encoder couldn't do what you did in your post. I don't know if one actually exists - I gave up on GIF long ago, after a string of horrendous failures similar to yours, where even the simplest animations would result in 1 MiB outputs and have horrible dithering banding throughout.<p>Add to that the similar disregard in <i>decoding</i> in browsers - where a 256 KiB GIF takes a full 45 seconds to load (stuttering and freezing for 20 seconds at a time) on a 50mpbs connection running on an i7 CPU as a result of the combined failure of encoders and decoders alike.

4532979,comment,4527506,4531947,3,0,dsrguru,,,"Figuring out how to encode various classes of data into images is one of the more challenging aspects of the method of loci. Also, memorizing an associative array of data is less natural in the method of loci than memorizing ordered data since the way you recall the data is by tracing your steps through the memory palace in your mind. I guess you could place two images at each location, functioning sort of like a LISP alist (list of pairs where the first element in each pair represents a key and the second a value), but that still doesn't answer your question about how to create the images. Maybe go syllable by syllable? For example, if you wanted to remember that kochen is kitchen, you could visualize a macaw perched on the shoulder of Barbie's boyfriend while the latter flipped burgers on a toy grill. The ""caw"" sound in my dialect of English is identical to the ""ko"" in kochen, and Barbie's boyfriend Ken would be enough to trigger my memory of ""-chen"", so I'd be like ""Right! This was illustrating that the German word kochen means to cook.""<p>Spaced repetition lends itself a lot more naturally to memorizing foreign language vocabulary words than the method of loci, so you might want to use that approach instead. Within spaced repetition, you can also use vivid images as a sort of scaffolding to increase the odds you'll remember the word before the next review, and you can eventually let that image go once you start recalling it easily. The more connections you form to other thoughts, the more firmly a fact will be anchored in your mind, so you might as well use mental images if you can come up withthem, even in spaced repetition. James Heisig uses visual mnemonics to teach several thousand Chinese characters in Remembering the Kanji[1] (Chinese characters for use in Japanese) and Remembering the Hanzi[2] (Chinese characters for use in Chinese), and communities like AJATT[3] and Reviewing the Kanji[4] advocate combining Heisig's approach with spaced repetition.<p>[1] <a href=""http://nirc.nanzan-u.ac.jp/publications/miscPublications/Remembering_the_Kanji_1.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nirc.nanzan-u.ac.jp/publications/miscPublications/Rem...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://nirc.nanzan-u.ac.jp/publications/miscPublications/Remembering%20Hanzi%201.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nirc.nanzan-u.ac.jp/publications/miscPublications/Rem...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://kanji.koohii.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kanji.koohii.com/</a>",1347895625

4532963,comment,4532768,4532768,6,0,fecak,,,"15 years recruiting software engineers, and I agree that the industry needs some major changes.  The problem you mention about candidates being used unknowingly to bait potential new customers has been around for a while, and many recruiters are not providing the proper value for the price.<p>I've started using a different model with my clients.  I don't want to go into too much detail, but my clients pay me a smaller up front fee to initiate a search, and then a fee upon hire.  The combined fees (front and back end) per candidate end up being much lower than the industry standards, perhaps even half what others are charging.<p>Why would I provide my service at approximately half the cost of other companies?  For one, when a client pays me up front, it guarantees my fee and reduces my risk.  Contingency recruiters take on 100% of the risk, whereas in a retained relationship the hiring entity assumes 100% of the risk.  My model spreads that risk. I'm willing to take a lower fee, so long as my fee is guaranteed.<p>My model will surely not be popular with contingency firms that have hundreds of recruiters that they can burn through (pay them peanuts + commission until they burn out), but I think if more small boutique firms used this model regionally, many small software firms would jump at the chance to work with one small firm that is going to produce with a minimal number of candidates (usually 2-3 per search for my clients).  Having the up front payment allows me to be more selective to find the right fit, instead of just trying to find ANY fit.",1347895460

And that's if there are any areas of concern at all, you could just have hit a streak of bad luck. But, I will tell you something I've learned about when selling yourself to potential companies.<p>A while back I ran across a TEDx video titled How Great Leaders Inspire Action given by Simon Sinek.You can watch it at the TED website, but the summary of the talk is ""People don't buy what you do, they buy why you do it.""<p>The idea is what can you do to make the hiring person get excited about you? You're a Java developer - there are a lot of those. You have a lot of experience - so do a lot of other candidates. Education - others have it to. Basically, what makes you a unique and memorable candidate?<p>You even said it yourself - you didn't take the job with the startup because you didn't feel you and the founder were on the same wavelength. Well, that's what the hiring company wants to get from you. They want to know you're on their wavelength. You can't communicate that by telling them what you can do, or how good you are at it. You communicate that you're on the same wavelength by telling them why you do what you do. You have to give them something that gets them excited about you as an individual, something that makes them forget about the other candidates.<p>That's my perspective, and it's worked out fairly well for me. Especially now that I'm a senior developer, I rarely talk about what I do. I've had years of experience, it's just expected at this point that I have the skills. I wouldn't have been so consistently recruited or promoted if I didn't have the skills. That means the skills I have aren't worth talking about at all. On my own site, and how I present myself in general, I don't talk about my capabilities. I talk about the WHY.<p>Note: ""to get a paycheck"" will not suffice as an answer to why you do what you do. You have to have a real answer for this question, and it is a problem. A lot of people don't know why they do what they do, which is why there are a lot more people who can't figure out how to get to the top. This may even require you figuring out what it is you really want to do, and switching job types or careers completely. Any company that hires someone who just wants to collect a paycheck isn't a company where anyone is going to be happy. You'll just be in a cubicle next to dozens of other unhappy people who only showed up that morning so they can continue to collect their paycheck.",1347894184

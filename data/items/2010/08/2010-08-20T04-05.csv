Humility. Be a humble guy - hang around with people who are experts in subject areas that you know nothing about - and only talk about those subject areas<p>- You mention being smart. Are you good at practical things like DIY, fixing your car etc? If not, find someone / some people who are good at that and then do something with them and notice how lame you are.<p>- Volunteer at a charity - nothing builds humility in my opinion than when you serve people less well off / disadvantaged compared to you. Once you also talk and listen to lots of folk you then realise that they're just as smart as you, they just haven't had the same opportunities as you and that makes you profoundly grateful.",1282280261

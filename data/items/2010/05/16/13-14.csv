Ah well.<p>Anyway, I've been saying for years that something like this was inevitable, so I'm not too surprised it came along. It could even become something useful: there are some very good reasons people might not want to use Django, and you could save them some time. Constructive criticism is useful, too, so done right I could really learn from a site like this.<p>So, if I may, I'd like to ask you to take the time and focus on this and make sure it contains useful information.

I think you'll want to raise your monthly fee considerably, on the order of 2-3x that amount. Or, consider offering multi-tiered pricing (more on that below).<p>I run a startup (<a href=""http://doleaf.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://doleaf.com</a>) that also deals with small businesses, and they require A LOT of handholding. Plus, they'll always want to talk with you and tell you how to do things (which is both good and bad). All that time should count in your head as work time (believe me, it's way tougher than writing code) and you need to price things as such.<p>I suggest you definitely consider multi-tiered pricing based on the number of members in the loyalty program. Ironically, I think your bigger clients will probably need less handholding, but they can help subsidize the time you spend working with the smaller ones.<p>Overall, I think this is an excellent idea. Are you considering accepting customers in the USA? This might be a good fit for some of the nurseries I work with, and I'd be happy to pass it along to them.",1274017553

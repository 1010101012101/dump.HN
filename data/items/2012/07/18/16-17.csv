(It's a similar issue with git: bad UI, but every git question and answer is described in terms of the CLI, so even if you prefer a GUI client, say, you still need to be able to formulate your problem in CLI terms for anyone on stackoverflow to understand you.)",1342630799

Oracle removed the limit code so that some customers would unwittingly exceed their licensed number.

An organisation has a name, a phone number, an address, an added on date, an added by date, and on and on. An so does a Person, a Project, an Order, an Enquiry.<p>99% of columns are simple data stores that have no sort of 'unique functionality' you describe. They exist to store data that's only purpose is to be recorded and later re-displayed or updated. Hell most problems that require a DB don't have this 'unique functionality' you describe.<p>For example a bunch of static methods on an Order class or in a OrderDataAdapter:<p><pre><code>    Order.Get(id)\n    Order.Get(accountCoordinatorUsername)\n    Order.GetUnassigned()\n    Order.GetOrdersByPartner(id, (optional)boolIncludeCompleted)\n    etc., etc.\n</code></pre>\nSo in reality you add the new propety to your class, let's say 'expectedDealValue', an int for our purposes. But it's mandatory.<p>You then have to add the column to every method that uses this value. You have to go through all those other totally unrelated methods checking and changing each and every single one of them. And this table is probably accessed in other classes too, say like the QuarterlyReport class, so it's now a find and hunt scenario.<p>Unless you're relying on SELECT *, but no sane SQL programmer does that right?<p>In the bad old days you'd start rolling your own ORM to try and manage this mess. It would invariably suck and cause more problems than it solved. Today's ORMs are a god-send to this type of coding.",1342627615

It's amazing for cross-platform development and it's a shame that much shittier alternatives like GTK+ are far more common.<p>But it's just not going to work on cross-platform mobile. The user interfaces in, say, Linux and Windows (7) use very similar if not identical UI components and patterns. Android and iOS are very different about the designs of their apps (even though they may seem similar at first look).<p>If you want to make well-designed apps that actually comply with the guidelines, Qt will need to include millions of different proxies to native behavior to accomplish this. For example, the menus of your app will involve creating it once for Android and once for iPhone. Then you have a lot of different logic for the Android version of your app and iOS version of your app and it becomes a gigantic mess.<p>Of course, first you need to make sure that at least the basic components that exist in both platforms look and behave correctly. Buttons, check boxes, text boxes... Right now in Qt for Android they don't even use the native styling but fall back to something that looks like Linux from 15 years ago.<p>Not only that, there are so many things that you have to get right with creating an UI for a mobile touch app from scratch that it's hard to even start listing out the reasons here. One thing that I can think of right now is native touch behavior: even Google can't get this right in Chrome for Android, where scrolling web pages feels completely different to other lists in the OS and the built-in stock browser. (Firefox has the same problem.)<p>Then there's accessibility, the adaptation of your UI to wildly varying screen sizes and densities and the list goes on.<p>Even worse, Android UI is constantly evolving at the moment and there are so many new things. Countless developers fail to adapt these new features in their native apps: Qt isn't going to fare any better.<p>To accomplish an Android UI that looks and feels familiar you need to use the native libraries. It's that simple. They're in Java, it sucks, deal with it.<p>The developers of the Necessitas Qt port for Android seem to be so out of touch with reality anyway. I remember reading a discussion in their mailing list when they were getting started about the soft keyboard: their intention was to _implement their own soft keyboard in the apps_ instead of using the native keyboard. Fortunately, somebody sane intervened.<p>There's some existing apps in the Play Store that actually use it and if you take a look at them you can see how much of a trainwreck Qt on Android is. <a href=""https://market.android.com/publish/images/PQAAAPtpmMphsM1j7-1wapG8pK_AN7EXpFCy64vDRt8tJdSYsEjPwCcyndLpcr8OxXLmIIzjzEcG61sr6w5wO9YMQSUAzfqVaXDnaxgZauCW-2iG3c92I3HYOOYj.png"" rel=""nofollow"">https://market.android.com/publish/images/PQAAAPtpmMphsM1j7-...</a> is a fairly descriptive screenshot.<p>Also, Necessitas requires the user to install 30 megabytes of libraries.

I don't like paying $1800 per month in taxes so my neighbors living rent free in Section 8 housing can stay up until 3am having parties while I'm trying to sleep for work the next day. But I'm not firebombing the IRS because of it -- I simply vote for the candidates who most support my views. Firebombing gets headlines, but it doesn't catalyze change. Voting does, contributing to political campaigns does, volunteering to knock on doors does.<p>It just seems incredibly selfish that some people feel like they have a right to every piece of information or have a right to steal any content they want without any regard for the consequences or the effects of this ""freedom"" on the people that produce the information. You right to information shouldn't override a person's right to not get killed because of it.<p>It seems like the people most passionate about Wikileaks are people that have little experience with the nature of classified information and the consequences of releasing sources and methods to the general public. Perhaps if more people spent time in public service rather than public criticism, we could really improve the governments of our respective countries. When was the last time anyone here on HN ran for a local school board election or even went to a city council meeting? When was the last time anyone here wrote and mailed their congressman an actual letter? How many people here have applied to work in the Foreign Service, the military or even the Peace Corps? I know for a fact that CIA, NSA and FBI would be salivating over the qualifications of many of you here, yet many of you would never even consider those careers because of a jaded anger or indifference towards the government, yet, the government is us. If we don't step up, things will never change. You can't achieve justice from the outside looking in. You can vandalize, steal or threaten your way to a better world.<p>I do agree, however, that there is a large amount of information that is classified for reasons other than protecting sources or methods, but is instead classified for political purposes. For example, the Fast and Furious documents are being protected under ""Executive Privilege"" for the sole reason of protecting politicians from the scrutiny of voters. The 1979 House Select Committee on Assassinations files, for example, are classified not because of national security concerns, but political ones; the same goes for many 1960s-era East-Germany operations, as well Vietnam-War era documents. However, we should be pressuring politicians to evaluate the rules of classification or appoint an independent FOIA commission to evaluate document requests objectively instead of through the current lens of political expediency.<p>I expect to get down voted into oblivion, but hopefully, someone will get it.",1342627485

It basically checkouts stuff from the git repo, minifies and bundles the JS files, uploads the assets to the CDN and tags the repo with the version string. Though Capistrano has been traditionally a ruby deployment tool, it works well for any type of deployment. You just need to override or not use some of the Ruby-specific stuff. Deploying to multiple servers is ridiculously easy with Capistrano.",1342627473

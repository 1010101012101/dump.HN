And getting one now is premature optimization. Wait until you find yourself trying to get a specific kind of job, but failing, because the jobs are being snapped up by people with advanced degrees. Then get a master's. It only takes a year.<p>I bet you'll wait a long time before that happens.<p>And why play the go-back-to-school-for-free card now? It's valuable. Keep it in your pocket for a while. You've <i>been</i> in school recently, at <i>Stanford</i> for god's sake -- you've already got a lot of recent contacts from your school days, and you're <i>already in</i> a startup hub. So, wait. After you spend a few years in industry, and find yourself stuck in a rut, you'll discover that it's wonderful to have a ready-made excuse to take a year off, go back to school, and make a whole new set of friends and professional contacts. You might even have a better idea of what you want to study, and where, and with whom.",1209913096

Here's how to do it:\na) get an MA\nb) get a job - work at least 5 years\nc) go back for your Ph.D.<p>Advantages - you will have to be motivated enough to give up a pay cheque.  However, being more mature than the other kids, you will get financial aid first.<p>You gain a lot of credibility in industry with a Doctorate...people defer to you on all things scientific.  And you join an elite club, though not quite as elite as it used to be before they required all professors to have a Ph.D., forcing colleges to hand them out to people like me to keep the supply of professors steady.<p>Oh, and put your all your advisers on every paper you publish.  It is hard to deny someone a degree after they have published 5 papers that you agreed with so much you put your name to it.<p>And get rid of that foolinsh ""create an account"" waste of time - do you really believe any data entered these is not junk?\nDr. J.

If they are the same track six months from now that they are on today, you can expect some real gnashing of teeth among the shareholders.<p>On the other hand, Microsoft comes out of this looking pretty good (among the none geek crowds).

Just listen to yourself:<p><i>I'd much rather like to start working, doing my own projects, etc. </i><p>And so you should.<p><i>What's a PhD worth?</i><p>Three to five years of existential despair.<p><i>will a PhD get me somewhere a MA wouldn't be able to get me?</i><p>Well, my Ph.D. is in EE with a concentration in semiconductor manufacturing and quantum electronics. So mine got me into labs filled with one-of-a-kind, multimillion dollar equipment, and gave me an up-close and <i>extremely</i> personal view of how microelectronics are made. Later, it allowed me to contribute to cancer research (cancer cells = microscopy = optics!) and spend a delightful but unrenumerative three years learning about the biosciences from the inside. None of which was fun enough for me that I wanted an actual <i>N</i>-year career in it, but it was certainly fun. Perhaps even fun enough to be worth the cost.<p>Unfortunately, you're thinking about a Ph.D. in comp sci, which will get you access to a crappy desk with a PC on it, a lot of barely adequate coffee, an inferiority complex, a lack of sleep, a lack of pay, and the opportunity to write a huge tome that only a handful of other people will read. I assure you that all of these things are available to civilians at a great discount.<p><i>Should I only pursue a PhD if my goal is to go in academia/research?</i><p>Yes, that's what it's for.<p><i>Would a MA be more advisable if I just want to pursue my entrepreneurial career?</i><p>Yes. ""I'm getting an M.A."" is a great excuse to move to a startup hub and hang around with a bunch of smart programmers who are itching for action. So I won't talk trash about the M.A. -- go for it, if you like. The sunk costs are a lot lower, and the benefits higher.<p>For more on this topic see <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=117294"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=117294</a> .

The fine scales are poorly understood, and most models come with various disclaimers. Many parameters are unknown, and reasonable quantitative predictions are impossible. Plenty of examples show models to fail, but they are still used since they sometimes work.<p>Life is messy, and studying a mess leaves you with a messy field.

A graduate degree from Stanford will always ""look good"" on the resume, but I wonder what it will do toward further your freelancing goal.  One thing to keep in mind, and all caveats apply, but in my experience I have found that many organizations/clients view higher level degrees as a ""sign"" (valid or not matters little IMO) that you are prime leadership material.  This may be beneficial in winning contracts.  At the same time it may make you appear over-qualified (less likely I would say).  It's a delicate balance.",1209910193

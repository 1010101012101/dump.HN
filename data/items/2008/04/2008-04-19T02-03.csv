Here are the rules (and they work):<p>1- eat anything you want (don't eat diet crap)<p>2- eat when you're <i>hungry</i> (no emotional eating)<p>3- eat mindfully (one bite at a time, put your fork down, chew 20 times or so, taste your food)<p>4- stop when you are full.<p>The rest is elaboration. Exercise helps, of course, and learning to enjoy exercise will help you in a lot of ways (disease prevention etc.).<p>But the big thing for me has been learning how to eat. That conquered, the rest comes naturally.",1208573235

Unfortunately, everyone who does it winds up competing on cost.<p>Why? Because the telephone has had over 100 years of innovation. So every VOIP company recreates the wheel and sells it for less than the telcos or PBX companies by making it free or almost free. In the end cellphones will win out. The only thing people seem to care about VOIP for is games. The rest of the time they're just as likely to pick up a cell phone or land line.",1208572842

I swore on my blog that I will never introduce AdWords because I don't like ads on anyone else's blog and I think it disrespects what the reader visits for.<p>Also, I think it causes you to write popular or sensational things as you see your revenue fluctuate.  It doesn't cause you to write what you actually want to write, which in the end isn't really good for anyone.<p>Also, a blog can still make you money if you do it well.  It will expand your general net presence and reputation which can have a positive impact on your opportunities and careers.  It's just not something you can stare at in Google Analytics and write in your checkbook.<p>Obviously, this doesn't apply to someone intending to be a career blog writer.  If that's your thing, good luck with that.",1208570470

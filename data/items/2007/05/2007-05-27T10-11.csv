I wasn't expecting you to, that's why I wondered how these costs got covered.  I like the idea of the tip recipients having the option to tip you in turn for collecting the tips;  very neat.  I may not be the only one to read the web site and wonder how transaction costs are covered though so perhaps a little more detail somewhere for us pedants would be good.",1180263138

Of course you're probably going to get into a world of fun ""internal accounting"" taking this approach... you will probably want to ""bill"" the appropriate holding company for time spent working on that project, etc.",1180261414

10904443,comment,10901740,10901740,0,0,Animats,,,"Interesting idea.  The data plate on the order station says it was made by &quot;Vitarama&quot;.  Vitarama was the company behind Cinerama.  Owned by the Rockefellers, it developed a range of unusual projection devices - projectors for spherical screens and elliptical screens, gunnery training simulators, and a range of slide changers.  Fred Waller, who invented Cinerama and worked for Vitarama, was probably involved. He had a patent for an addressable slide projector.[1] The shopping system used a linear tray rather than the circular tray shown in the Life article, but the selection by number is similar.<p>The idea wasn&#x27;t silly.  At the time, Sears and some other companies had catalog order centers, where customers could go and shop from catalogs.  This was an improvement on that concept.<p>The problem may have been the user interface.  It looks like you&#x27;d ask the attendant to load up a slide tray for the product area of interest, and then you could use a knob to select slides.  Each slide contained only one image. This makes for a small catalog.<p>They could have used a microfiche system and had a much larger catalog. But how to address it in a user-friendly way?  That&#x27;s a hard problem.  If you&#x27;ve ever used microfilm data, you&#x27;re aware of how hard it is to find anything.  Their UI had two buttons and a knob, probably the upper limit for shopping UI complexity in the 1950s.\nSome later microfilm systems had bar codes and some the ability to search, but that was a late 1960s development and required electronics.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.google.com.ar/patents/US2732758"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com.ar/patents/US2732758</a>",1452805175

There is no need to avoid JavaScript wrappers to the DOM API, and lots of good reasons to have them. External libs are more flexible and fixable than web platform APIs.

Untagged unions are C&#x27;s unions, where there&#x27;s no discriminant, and you just have to know which type is valid at a given time.<p>Rust supports tagged unions, but can also optimize them to untagged in certain circumstances.

It does go down once in a while but it comes roaring back in relatively short time. Even when dropping, it rarely goes below 25% protecting most of the principal. This is about the only item that had massive inflation in past 7 years.</i><p>This is incorrect. The median new house price in the US hit a pre-recession peak in March 2007 of $262,600. In Nov 2015, the price was $305,000. An investment in a theoretical &quot;median real estate&quot; fund would have returned 16.4% over the 7 year period. [1]<p>An investment in the S&P500, say through SPY or the Vanguard ETF (if it had been available pre 2009) would have returned 27.9% over the same period, or 53.1% if you had reinvested your 5.0% annualized dividends. [2]<p>At a more granular level (using Zillow data) - the median housing price in San Francisco over the same period increased from $786k to $1.12m for a return of 42.4%. Cambridge, 47.0%. Manhattan, 66.6%.<p>San Diego? 3.5%. Boise? -12.6%. St. Louis? -22.9%. Detroit? -49.6%. Did you know that the median sales price of a house in Detroit is currently $38.4k?<p>---<p>> <i>In economics, you can make anything a currency which cannot be manufactured easily and is available in quantity that is very hard to grow. Economists are puzzled why the tons of money poured in to system through QEs isn&#x27;t producing any inflation. I think QEs are indeed producing massive inflation but it all goes in to real estate. Funds like Blackstone eventually ends up with significant chunk of QE money and guess what is their major investment activity these days? The easy &quot;inexpensive&quot; money is the best way to inflate real estate.</i><p>Economists are (for the most part) in agreement that QE is not causing inflation due to a lack of aggregate demand. Here is an article [3] in which Brad DeLong (UC Berkeley, Keynesian-adherent) agrees with Joseph Stiglitz (Nobel Laureate, voted 4th &quot;most influential&quot; economist in the world today) when he makes the following assertion:<p><i>The economics of this inertia is easy to understand, and there are readily available remedies. The world faces a deficiency of aggregate demand, brought on by a combination of growing inequality and a mindless wave of fiscal austerity...The only cure for the world&#x27;s malaise is an increase in aggregate demand. Far-reaching redistribution of income would help, as would deep reform of our financial system -- not just to prevent it from imposing harm on the rest of us, but also to get banks and other financial institutions to do what they are supposed to do: match long-term savings to long-term investment needs.</i> [4]<p>---<p>What does this have to do with the higher real estate prices in urban centers? I believe that what is truly happening is that many are flocking to a decreasing number of cores (usually around universities that churn out well-educated but low-paid graduates) for fewer aggregate job opportunities in select sectors: finance, tech, entertainment, business services (consulting, HR, accounting, etc.), and services (food, drinks, nail salons, etc.). This has happened in a relatively short amount of time as the employment market is generally more fluid and less regulated than the housing market, which is restricted and regulated in the extreme in high-demand, high-price markets.

Of course the part of the brain that can speak always speaks highly of itself to the detriment of all the other bits of brain. The important thing is to convince all of yourself that something is worth doing. Telling yourself that you <i>should</i> do something is as persuasive as someone else chiding you to do it. Yes, the verbal, &quot;planning&quot; part of your brain has convinced itself, but it is also self-absorbed and treats the rest of the brain like its footstool.<p>For an example, &quot;I should lose weight&quot; is a ridiculously abstract concept to most of your brain. Your talky bit thinks it&#x27;s saying something concrete: &quot;Get that number on the scale down&quot;, but it hasn&#x27;t actually said enough. It&#x27;s a half-baked aspiration, not an activity. &quot;I should exercise&quot; is better: It prescribes an abstract activity that would accomplish the goal. It&#x27;s still terrible though because it&#x27;s still abstract. What is the value of exercise in the abstract? You don&#x27;t experience exercise in the abstract: how could you possibly judge whether it is rewarding or not? How can you decide to &quot;exercise&quot; when exercise isn&#x27;t even a real thing?<p>&quot;I should run&quot; is even better: You know how running feels. You can feel good running, and you can feel bad running. There are actual experiences and knowledge to draw upon to determine the value of running. Still: Not enough. Should you be running all the time? Verbal brain is being awfully sloppy, and has the gall to blame the rest of the brain for its mistakes. &quot;I should run tomorrow in the morning for 30 minutes when I wake up.&quot; And we have arrived at remedy #3 which is called implementation intention. Honestly, what other intentions are actually intentions? If you&#x27;re not planning concrete actions but abstract classes of actions, you&#x27;re daydreaming, not planning. Verbal brain likes to talk about how important obligations and commitments are, but avoids doing the work of translating its precious thoughts into something intelligible to the rest of the brain.<p>The verbal part of your brain is easily convinced: By its own words. It doesn&#x27;t even know what it has convinced itself of but it is awfully satisfied with itself. You, the ensemble of brain bits, are obviously skeptical of such a gullible entity. When you experience satisfaction or gratification for doing something, that is real knowledge to your brain; you learn what is good and what is bad.

From Wikipedia:<p>&quot;On March 13, 2013, Terry M.

For example, in the US, R&D spending is not taxed, and can be deducted from gross revenue before calculating a tax bill.  For some people, that means that the US subsidizes R&D for fossil fuel research, but since the US subsidies <i>all</i> R&D, I don&#x27;t feel like this qualifies as a specific subsidy to fossil fuels.

Also, for some reason XMPP has seen some success in military), it has all the benefits of being an approved IETF protocol (one of which being that it will still be here in 10 years, whatever happens). Sure, it&#x27;s old stinky XML, but it&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s a brand new technology where little documentation exists.

It&#x27;s a huge huge job, but for a community of developer it&#x27;s not enough. There has already been talks to update the suite of extensions that are considered almost-mandatory in a modern IM software; it would also be really awesome to have a reference implementation for each usage (ie one server, one IM client, one VoIP client, one microblogging client, ...) because, like many others, I find tangible code we all agree on to be of very high value.<p>I fear that other protocols will be created, they will all (or at least a good part) die, and in the end we&#x27;ll have XMPP, standing there in the waves of protocols, chugging along quietly. People will be mocking it not because it doesn&#x27;t work, but because they don&#x27;t understand it (and that will be a fault with XMPP, not with people, because it will remain extremely complex)",1452803794

Tho, first, Goenka explicitly sates that whatever part of the theory, you don&#x27;t like, take it out, as long as the practice is in tact. From a scientific point of view, the practice is tested to work very well. Only on my personal level, it works very well in alignment with the mental body-mind model I developed over the years, but it not a published scientific model, at least yet.<p>Unfortunately, that your physical model does not have a model for rebirth like information exchange does not mean there exists none. Hey, if you think in the standard model, your model has be proven to never predict absorption lines correctly apart from all the other problems it has. Not all 4 general believed facts on a black hole can all be true at the same time. Lots of unexplained phenomena even counterfactual.<p>The model I adopted explains general and special relativity, all known quantum mechanical effects, rules and energies and predicts some more, the periodic table, stable and unstable isotops, all chemical bonds, absorption lines, has a correct arrow of time, irreversible processes and is ultimately reversible, explains much more cosmological phenomena then your model, quasars, pulsars, binary pulsars, cepheids of type II, globular clusters, and and and<p>Uses much stricter energy conservation, stricter logic while having fewer assumptions.<p>And yes, it also has predicted phenomena not existing in your model at all, called ring photons. One or many photons entangled with: start<->end, building a very stable ring with 2 bits of information. Those can build up loop in loop structures encoding very dense informations in a very quite stable structure. And know what, those rings are predicted to be emmited in 3 amino acids we humans use, so - I see things a bit different now, scientifically :)<p>But I don&#x27;t see those fields as some indestructible object, and more like fragments that flow around. But without understanding the model it will not make much sense for you.",1452803255

Motley Fool mentioned it a couple of months ago as well, and if you can make use of Franking Credits you&#x27;ll get even more value out of it [1].<p>If you&#x27;ve got E-Trade, go into Quotes & Research -> Tools -> Basic Stock Filter and search by Yield > 8%.

One of the world&#x27;s biggest mining operations, and the shares have tanked post-mining-boom.  Surely they&#x27;ll have to cut their dividend, but even if it was halved, it would still hit your 5% extremely-good-dividend level.<p>Other names I recognize are Seven West Media (SWM.AX, 10.44%) who own newspapers & television stations, but also have part-ownership of Netflix competitor Presto that is preloaded on Samsung televisions.  Beyond International (BYI.AX, 9.09%) produce television shows like Mythbusters, and have had steadily increasing dividends over the years.<p>Anyway, that&#x27;s the approach I&#x27;ve taken: it&#x27;s usually about buying into well known companies that pay dividends that steadily grow over the years, at times when the share price has been hit so hard that the dividend yields become huge.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.fool.com.au/2015/12/04/todays-telstra-share-price-is-offering-a-5-8-fully-franked-yield/?source=aptyholnk3030003#"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fool.com.au/2015/12/04/todays-telstra-share-price...</a>",1452803188

Just keep your eyes peeled for yellow highlights and squiggly lines, and you can have confidence that your codebase is clean.  JSDoc is very verbose, which is a shame, and you have to get good at forming types that are conducive to its tags.

But it can be helpful to distinguish code from data and the same applies to containers vs data. On the few occasions when a conceptual distinction is <i>not</i> helpful, one should simply ignore the distinction. (This is perhaps somewhat like lisp macros that could be said to conceptually treat code as code or as data depending on whether or not it&#x27;s helpful to the human writer or reader to treat it one way or the other.)<p>> A string is a container of characters<p>In Perl 6 a &quot;string&quot; is not a &quot;container&quot; even if you like to think of it that way and/or use the words that way.<p>> So should the window.Add(subWindow) method automatically loop over the subSubWindows of subWindow and add each of them as direct children of window, or should it simply add subWindow to window directly so its subSubWindows are grandchildren of window?<p>Exactly. Both interpretations can make sense.<p>This is why Perls provide notation to emphasize either the scalar or composite interpretation of an entity and to optionally switch to the other interpretation for any given mention of that entity in code.[3]<p>> It&#x27;s fuzzy magical thinking to believe that Perl&#x27;s dichotomy of scalar/array maps directly to your brain&#x27;s concept of singular/plural.<p>Audience member, to Deepak Chopra: &quot;You stated ... that &#x27;all belief is a cover-up for insecurity&#x27;, right?&quot; Deepak: &quot;Uhuh&quot;.

Aiui it&#x27;s an even more primitive mechanism than processing hierarchy and singular/plural aspects.<p>> Must the keys be strings, or might they be any hashable idea?<p>Again, I think I&#x27;m on solid ground when I say that humans&#x27; brains naturally support association of arbitrary &quot;things&quot;.<p>Perl 6 supports any hashable entities as hash keys, not just strings.<p>> Do Perl references work exactly the same way as actual human neurons? What about dolphin brains? Please show me some peer reviewed scientific studies that prove Perl arrays accurately model natural language and mirror human thought, and then I will concede that Perl is more linguistically or biologically &quot;natural&quot; than Python.<p>(I rather suspect you&#x27;d still not change your mind even if such ridiculous studies could and did exist and I showed them.)<p>For now I&#x27;ll just mention &quot;A new study provides new evidence that programmers are using language regions of the brain when understanding code and found little activation in other regions of the brain devoted to mathematical thinking.&quot;[7] and ask you to read the linked article and/or the study itself before declaring it entirely bogus.<p>> But until I see some proof to the contrary, I believe that Larry Wall is to linguistics as Deepak Chakra is to physics<p>One good antidote to confirmation bias is reflection on the copious scientific evidence that expressed sincere confidence is generally inversely proportional to measured competence in relation to a given skill.<p>That said, while I&#x27;m fairly confident that you will not have changed your mind about any of the things we&#x27;ve discussed, my hope is that I&#x27;m incompetent at reading your character and we&#x27;re making actual progress in mutual understanding, at least inasmuch as you manage to be more creative with your sarcasm in the future. :)<p>[1] <a href=""http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WittgensteinsLadder"" rel=""nofollow"">http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WittgensteinsLadder</a><p>[2] I refer to your mistaken notion of Perls &quot;dividing all possible types into two different classes, and then using punctuation to distinguish variables holding those two classes&quot;.<p>[3] Imo aspects of Perl 5 related to this were fairly simple for declaring and using simple data structures but quickly became much too complex for my taste for more complex structures and usage.<p>Over the last 5 years or so a consensus emerged in the Perl 6 community that the Perl 6 version of this part of the language&#x27;s syntax and semantics was another mess, ruining what was otherwise considered a good design for declaring and using deep data structures.

Companies are there to make a profit, plain and simple.  You are one of the many resources that allows them to do that.<p>&quot;use your social network to promote the company, recruit friends to the team, go to events in the evening, and use your personal equipment.&quot;<p>Companies may expect this, but I will never give this much to a company..unless it&#x27;s my own or I have a significant share.  You just need to learn to say no.  If enough people do this, companies won&#x27;t expect it.<p>My advice is to only do this when you need to prove yourself/get your foot in the door/you are trying to build some experience because you are first starting out.<p>&quot;All of this would be fine if employees benefited from their sacrifice in the same way their bosses do&quot;<p>Employees don&#x27;t benefit a much, because they often times either aren&#x27;t making key decisions, don&#x27;t have as much money or reputation on the line.  You get rewarded more for a larger risk or a unique ability.<p>Would you open up a credit line in your name in exchange for a percentage of the company?  If the company tanks, you owe that money to the bank.<p>This is what pretty much all business owners go thought and most employees aren&#x27;t willing to risk.<p>&quot;Bullshit! A business isn’t a bloodline. A business is a business, and anyone who treats it otherwise will be disappointed.&quot;<p>Totally agree.  This is a way to make it difficult to quit and guilt you into staying when things get rough.<p>&quot;If your company gets acquired for $30 million (good luck!), your 0.1% is worth $30,000 (at best). Acquired for $1 million? You get $1,000. Crash and burn? 0.1% of zero is zero.&quot;<p>The problem with numbers like this is that every situation is different.  A company that takes in tons of VC and is overvalued and then sold a few years later, will pay out to the VC first.<p>You also need to learn to read contracts (or get a lawyer to do it for you) and never sign something you don&#x27;t understand or want.   I take the emotion out of business and it makes things much easier.<p>&quot;At least a startup gives you a “lottery’s chance” of being rewarded as an employee.&quot;<p>If you want a chance to make millions, don&#x27;t work for a startup, create your own.  The risk is much higher, but so is the reward.<p>&quot;I don’t think you should give your best ideas to your employer.&quot;<p>I agree here too.  I always saved my best ideas for myself and now run a profitable company with those ideas.  My old boss is bankrupt.<p>&quot;Create a side-project. Do something independently. Carve out a piece of your life, and mold it your way.&quot;<p>Be careful though.  Many companies (especially in silicon valley) lay claim to all of your work.<p>I personally won&#x27;t sign contracts like this and will specifically list all of my current businesses/side projects as my own and get it in writing.  It&#x27;s never really been a problem for me.",1452802318

The first is censorship and blocking access to certain groups of IP blocks. Clearly this is getting written in to content licensing contracts and that&#x27;s too bad. If an IP address is not doing something hostile it should not be blocked. The second involves asking extremely poor people for more money.

That&#x27;s the nature of democracy.  If you&#x27;re opposed to that, then you&#x27;re by definition opposed to democracy.<p>Luckily, modern democracies involve multiple layers of government (town/city, county, state, federal) to serve as a moderating effect to prevent some little town full of jerks legislating blatantly horrible stuff, but those jerks do have the right to move where they want, buy property, and to vote.

The Republican party and the ultra-conservative movement of the past 25 years has created a new wild west; it's every man for himself.<p>BTW this is not just for Matt's ""Nintendo"" generation (Y, I presume).

343569,comment,343000,343521,0,0,greaterscope,,,"Most of the the side-projects I started were definitely interesting to me in some way. They were a way for me to explore how something could be made easier, how it should be done, and how it could help me get more done.<p>For my company/startup (<a href=""http://greaterscope.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://greaterscope.com</a>) I'm also building online storefront software, which has plenty of interesting problems. It can involve massive datasets (for me), clever algorithms, etc. It has been the perfect opportunity for me to harden and field-test my tools. This is written in PHP, because it's the language I know best, and I feel like the problem isn't ""solved"" for PHP yet.<p>But those are beside the point because I've started to think more about ""what I really want to do"" and how to ""not get stuck doing something I don't want to do"". So I defintely feel the need to find something I like doing even more than storefront software in PHP.<p>Thanks for the technology recommendations. Python is high on my list at the moment. I'm on the lookout.",1224945199

Buzzwords (not to be confused with technical terms) are created to sell books or consulting services.

I'll admit, it's necessary sometimes, but certainly not at the rate people do it at. The point of language is to communicate. And like I said, it's not like I hate the guy, some of his stuff is great. The rest...

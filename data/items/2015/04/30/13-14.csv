Doing cleanup during the audit took a ridiculous amount of resources and every company gave us a different answer on what needs to be licensed differing by 1000s of dollars sometimes.<p>The other is the barrier to entry. I was trying to get NAV2015 working for a demo using some data for a project, I spent at least 20 hours trying to figure out who to pay (Azure comes with it installed but no license -- why not just sell a bundled license into the hourly cost?) -- eventually gave up and set up OpenERP in like 30 minutes, spent 3 hours adding the feature I needed and was done.

9465050,comment,9464858,9464992,0,0,bradleyland,,,"I&#x27;m a subscriber of the slower update cycle explanation as well. Everyone I know who owns a tablet is happy with what it does for a longer period of time. Have a look at iPhone refreshes versus iPad refreshes and you&#x27;ll notice that the iPad follows the iPhone, so it should be no surprise where the iPad falls in the growth trajectory of the company.<p>Following that same line of examination (looking at refreshes), consider the impact of each refresh. What does a new iPad include?<p>Thinner and lighter? That&#x27;s a nice to have, but is it cost-of-upgrade nicer?<p>Touch ID? How important is Touch ID to users who use the iPad casually. With an iPhone you&#x27;re frequently operating the device with one hand, so Touch ID simplifies the authentication process. When you&#x27;re using your device for payments, Touch ID is pretty damned incredible. Neither of these apply to the iPad. I&#x27;d love to have Touch ID on my iPad, but it&#x27;s not worth the cost of an upgrade.<p>Better camera? I&#x27;m an outlier here — almost everyone I know uses their iPad as a camera, except me — but I&#x27;m just not sure this alone is enough to push people to upgrade. In the iPhone environment, all of these new features act cumulatively to make an iPhone upgrade worthwhile.<p>Larger size? Oh, wait. That&#x27;s iPhone only, and it&#x27;s probably one of the biggest drivers of iPhone 6/6+ sales. It&#x27;s irrelevant to the iPad.<p>Tablets, as a product, involve a slower upgrade cycle because they&#x27;re actually the more traditional product when compared to a device like the iPhone.",1430402268

I have a 2nd or 3rd gen iPad and I have absolutely zero reason to upgrade at this point.<p>- They are probably being squeezed to a certain degree. I find that, even with just an iPhone 6 rather than a Plus, I&#x27;m often more inclined to just read on my phone than go grab my tablet.<p>- I&#x27;ve probably become more quick to grab a Chromebook or some other laptop I have laying around than do anything half-way complicated on my tablet. So there may be some realization that tablets are sometimes more trouble than they&#x27;re worth even for more complex mostly-consumption tasks.<p>- I suspect that we may end up with some sort of tablet and laptop reconvergence even though tablets took off in large part because the convergence between the two devices was broken.",1430402168

9464984,comment,9463894,9463894,0,0,bane,,,"Coming from a country with a working, comprehensive, addressing system, I never understood how special this was until I started extensively traveling. It&#x27;s kind of mind-boggling how unique of an invention addresses are and yet how simple they are.<p>It requires only two things<p>- give an identifier to each road, numbers are perfectly fine (the scheme isn&#x27;t even all that important)<p>- each property plot along a given road gets an incrementing number, plots with multiple housing units are given some kind of subdivider (Apartment, Unit, etc.). This works best with oddly numbered properties on one side and evenly numbered properties on the other.<p>So long as you use unique identifiers, you don&#x27;t even need states, counties, zip codes or other administrative districts -- though this makes things easier -- all you need to know if the block of property numbers the address lives in.<p>An alternate approach is to simply subdivide a territory into smaller and smaller zones until you get to a small enough spot on the planet that you&#x27;ve uniquely identified a plot of land or a building or whatever. I believe Korean addresses used to use something like this but are slowly moving on to a mixed mode system like the U.S. uses (subdivide areas, then use street names and numbers).<p>It&#x27;s also seems absolutely insane that the concept of an address, or parts of an address can be some kind of Intellectual Property that a company holds some kind of right to. My understanding is that this used to be a significant problem with addressing in the U.K. and remains one in Ireland. The last time I visited Ireland, outside of the cities, addresses were give to us as Lat,Long coordinates! Absolute insanity.<p>I remember trying to send a package to a friend in rural England once, the address was something like &quot;The Yellow Home behind the Red Barn, Essex, U.K.&quot;. It took 8 weeks to arrive, I have no idea how much of that was spent by the Royal Mail matching color swatches and building combinations.<p>It&#x27;s an interesting notion that we couple postal service to addresses. In some places, like Dubai, they are decoupled and the post only makes its way to a P.O. Box, not to a residence -- which of course have no address, and end up with descriptions like &quot;Building ABC Behind the Market, off of the Second Exit, 2 Lefts and a Right after entry&quot; which is necessary for non-government postal services like Fedex. Oddly, this system makes a kind of sense in the Internet age, unless you actually have to get somewhere.<p>In some countries, local landmarks and these sorts of quasi-turn-by-turn directions-as-addresses are the norm. Oddly, they often persist long after what they describe is gone. &quot;The Red House behind the Temple&quot; might be somebody&#x27;s address, but the Temple fell during an Earthquake 20 years before and the house is no longer Red. The claim is that the local postman has enough local knowledge to make this work, but there&#x27;s so many obvious failure modes to make this sort of &quot;system&quot; seem absurd.<p>If you look back long enough, the U.S. didn&#x27;t <i>always</i> have a useful system. Old Revolutionary War era advertisements look like the kinds of semi-useless addresses you see elsewhere. Addresses definitely appears to be product of cities, but it&#x27;s useful when it&#x27;s used on a national scheme. It&#x27;s so simple and so absurdly effective, it&#x27;s always seemed bizarre to me that it&#x27;s just not universal.<p>This proposal is interesting, but ultimately a bad idea. Correct addressing encodes both a unique location <i>and</i> navigation way points.<p>Take a U.S. address:<p>1234 Main St.\nBeverly Hills, CA 90210<p>Beverly Hills, CA is honestly not necessary, but does make it human readable, 90210 tells you this location is out west and the post office has a map that subdivides it even more to a specific delivery zone.<p>There&#x27;s hopefully only one Main St. in that zip code, and the building is on the 1200 block of that street on the even side. When you arrive there, it should have &quot;1234&quot; on the building and the street signs should tell you that you are on the correct street.<p>A better proposal is perhaps to use a subdividing system. The world is split into N &quot;squares&quot; and each of those is split into N &quot;squares&quot; and each of those into N and so on until you&#x27;re at a fine resolution. A simple map lookup for &quot;Fred-Berry-Fred-Cow&quot; would get you to within a few meters of wherever. The military uses versions of such a system (MGRS, UTM, etc.) and without electronic aids you can pretty quickly find pretty much any place on the planet within a few moments.<p><a href=""http://www.earlyamerica.com/pages-past/ben-franklins-pennsylvania-gazette/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.earlyamerica.com/pages-past/ben-franklins-pennsyl...</a>",1430401541

Being an only child and having two working parents, I had to find something to amuse myself all day. My imagination ran wild and I was able to create entire universes in my head. But it was never a problem, I never felt bogged down by this imagination, rather I felt a compelling urge to continue developing it. Perhaps it&#x27;s because I never considered it a &quot;condition&quot;, but rather a gift that I was given that other children didn&#x27;t seem to have. They were forced to derive amusement from others or external sources like video games or a television, things I still loved but didn&#x27;t feel dependent on. I think this early urge to create things definitely spawned my interest in both music and programming.<p>I would urge anyone who also experiences this <i>not</i> to take the OP&#x27;s advice, instead, learn to embrace the gift you&#x27;ve been given and learn to control it with your own willpower. It is possible. Keep your imagination in its place, and don&#x27;t take drugs to diminish it.",1430399361

Today I use both of them in my project, and as a developer/dba I see pros and cons:<p>MS SQL:\n- The tools included like Management Studio are just great. This is totally next level to the Postgres tools.\n- Using multiple CPU cores for a single query is really helpfull in my scenario.\n- Easy continous backup to the cloud.\n- Included Integration Services, Analysis services are also easy and enugh for my usage.<p>Postgres:\n- Is running on linux, to it&#x27;s cheaper. Even when we use SQL Server as Bizspark (for free now), the Azure Windows VM for it costs us much more, than VM with Linux. And of course when we want to cluster our DB, Postgres is even cheaper.\n- Great JSON support. There are parts of our project where it&#x27;s helpfull.\n- Better configurability, like WAL, checkpoints etc. We have much better write performance on postgres than in sql server (probably just our case).<p>The other things really do not much difference. Both DB&#x27;s can be extended, and extensions may be written in many languages. Both achieve great overall performance, both have strong community and a lot of documentation.",1430399098

9464747,comment,9464505,9464505,0,0,Amezarak,,,"> In MS SQL Server, a CREATE PROCEDURE statement cannot appear halfway through a batch of SQL statements. There&#x27;s no good reason for this, it&#x27;s just an arbitrary limitation. It means that extra manual steps are often required to execute a large batch of SQL. Manual steps increase risk and reduce efficiency.<p>It&#x27;s been a while, but I am pretty sure all you have to do is put GO before/after the CREATE PROCEDURE. I&#x27;m absolutely positive there&#x27;s some way around it, because I&#x27;ve run many, many such scripts on SQL Server without manual intervention.<p>EDIT: Yes, I just fired up a VM and ran this and got the expected results with no errors.<p>CREATE DATABASE HackerNews;<p>CREATE TABLE dbo.Test (id int IDENTITY(1, 1), name varchar(20));<p>GO<p>INSERT INTO dbo.Test (name) VALUES (&#x27;Amezarak&#x27;);<p>GO<p>CREATE PROCEDURE dbo.sp_QueryTest\nAS\nSELECT * FROM dbo.Test;<p>GO<p>EXEC dbo.sp_QueryTest<p>In my personal opinion, MSSQL (including the tooling around it) is awesome and possibly one of Microsoft&#x27;s best products.

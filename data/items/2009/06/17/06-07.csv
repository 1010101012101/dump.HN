661485,comment,660674,661164,0,0,nex3,,,"One big problem with making selectors into mixins is that then every mixin takes up valuable space in the CSS file. This is enough of a problem as-is with Sass, although work is going to go into space optimizations in version 2.4.",1245221767
661484,comment,661440,661440,0,0,zealog,,,"Absolutely true.  Nothing here is ground breaking, but it seems like so many people forget this.  My greatest successes have always come from trying to ""scratch my own itch.""  In fact, it's usually something completely out of left field that never seemed like a business that turns out to resonate with others.",1245221696

I think the intention of the previous comment is clearly to point to Niniane as an inspiring programmer[1], who also happens to be female. On-topic for this story, and not stigmatizing, unless you feel simply discussing female under-representation is stigmatizing.<p>1. well, minus Lively",1245221657

661474,comment,661168,661235,0,0,idlewords,,,"Somehow the process that is selecting computer programmers out of the general population disproportionately selects men.  Unless you believe that the dearth of women in the field is driven by biology (and there the evidence is against you), it's pretty clear that women are being deterred from hacking by social factors.  Saying ""we need more women in CS"" is equivalent to saying, let's stop driving half the talent out of our field.",1245221002

At my previous startup, we were locked into PayPal because they wouldn't release the consumer CC#s and it's never good for business to have to ask your customers to input their payment info a second time (attrition is inevitable).  This time, we did a bit more research and our two top payment services (braintree and trustcommerce) both allowed full data portability (with a fee).",1245220838

It still wouldn't be feasible, for example, to bruteforce a password from its hash.",1245220629
661469,comment,660936,660936,0,0,Adlai,,,"SnapTwitter is a service to <i>dynamically</i> filter and respond to Tweets.<p>You can use a user-friendly interface to define conditions under which a Tweet is Snapped up. These Tweets are organized according to the conditions under which they were Snapped, and when you log in to the site, you can read through all the Tweets that SnapTwitter has Snapped up for you.<p>SnapTwitter is no old rhino; this young Snapper can learn new tricks. When you create a condition, you can customize your Snapper's response. It could send certain Tweets to your friends. It could SnapBack a new Twitter, using <i>dynamically generated</i> text, generated according to rules that you can define -- without writing a single line of code! You simply use the nice user-friendly interface to teach your Snapper how to twist around what is said in a Tweet into a response which can be automatically Twittered back.<p>Advanced users can write code for the conditions and the SnapBacks themselves, in a special language called STML (SnapTwitter Markup Language).<p>Some people might say that SnapTwitter is a cheap ripoff of a few good Internet ideas from the past, and I admit that. But it is nicer to ordinary people, and it's also the future of Twittering.<p>So quit sitting back and start SnappingBack!",1245220574

These videos are meant for high school students. Very basic lessons, but enough to make you want to explore the topic.<p>I was wondering if any of you know people/sites specially teaching fundamentals of algorithms/discrete mathematics in a similar way (the Mit OCW, berkley videos are the (typical) traditional class).

You mean writing it in Java?<p>It's true that Java has become utterly unfashionable. Unfortunately the popular replacements are very much limited by the fact that they are hundereds of times slower and force you into a multi process design in order to use multiple CPUs.<p>I've been trying really hard to replace Java in some projects and it's been really difficult, so I guess Java has got to have some quality beyond fashion. If you look for libraries that are well maintained, do non-trivial stuff that you don't want to do yourself, are fast, reasonably complete and up-to-date on Unix and Windows, you will find that 98% of them are written in Java or C.",1245219668

This doesn't mean I like it and approve of it personally, but I think it should be allowed and acceptable.<p>This is the crux of where we disagree.

If some web site pulls that crap with me, I stay the hell away from it. If I <i>have</i> to use that web site for some reason, I'll grouse about it. I wouldn't try to deprive those web sites of their right to use Flash in obnoxious ways, but <i>I</i> sure won't stand for it.<p>Similarly, Apple's behavior is unpleasant and disturbing and it should be treated as such.

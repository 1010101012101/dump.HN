5496251,comment,5493367,5493367,1,0,thisrod,,,"This post set me thinking about why I prefer acme to vi.  They're both derived from ed, and nowadays they both know about the mouse.  So how do they differ?<p>Vi splits insert and edit modes by time: you hit keys to toggle between them, letting you move the mouse less.  Acme does it by space: blue bits of the screen hold commands, beige ones hold text, letting you remember less.  To repeat a command in vi, you have to remember what you did.  In acme, you look for it and click it again.<p>Acme lacks an exact equivalent to vi's w, t and other motion commands.  However, double-click does ""select what I mean"", commands operate on the selection by default, and mouse chords do copy and paste.  I find that's enough.<p>Some people will always prefer vi, but acme could be a gateway drug for many others.  You can use it like Notepad, but there's a lot of magic hidden a mouse click away.",1365123511

This might be helpful in the execution of other attacks.
For example, an attacker might connect 100,000 IP addresses to the IRC bootstrap channel. You would then be very likely to connect only to attacker nodes. This state can be exploited in (at least) the following ways:
The attacker can refuse to relay blocks and transactions from everyone, disconnecting you from the network.
The attacker can relay only blocks that he creates, putting you on a separate network. You're then open to double-spending attacks.
If you rely on transactions with 0 confirmations, the attacker can just filter out certain transactions to execute a double-spending attack.
Low-latency encryption/anonymization of Bitcoin's transmissions (With Tor, JAP, etc.) can be defeated relatively easy with a timing attack if you're connected to several of the attacker's nodes and the attacker is watching your transmissions at your ISP.
Bitcoin makes these attacks more difficult by only making an outbound connection to one IP address per /16 (x.y.0.0). Incoming connections are unlimited and unregulated, but this is generally only a problem in the anonymity case, where you're probably already unable to accept incoming connections.
Looking for suspiciously low network hash-rates may help prevent the second one.
""<p>One could even go further to do signal analysis on the network looking for nodes whose hash rates are more similar than others and hash rates per period of time (which will happen if such a large scale operation were in process), point them out to other nodes, and require that that node verify themselves with information which could allow for an independent audit by others before unflagging the node(s) in question.<p>EDIT: if anyone is interested in possible working on an open source project for rogue node mitigation that miners can install on their rigs, im game :P besides i think it would be more fun than going solo with my algos on the BTCUSD cross exchanges :P",1365123390

Chaum, Okamoto, and many other researchers published a large volume of work on digital cash, creating systems that supported various notions of secure and anonymous electronic payments.  Unlike Bitcoin, the security of many of these designs can be proved by reductions to hard problems, much like the security of public-key cryptosystems like ElGamal.  In the typical ""hack it out and pay no attention to previous work"" style of the Bitcoin community, none of that research was cited or even hinted at in the original Bitcoin paper.  The fact that the article presents this as a choice between something like Bitcoin and something like Paypal is telling.<p>The reason Chaum's digital cash startup failed is complicated, but it boils down to this:  digital cash is poorly understood, banks have few compelling reasons to deploy it (their existing fraud mitigation measures keep them well within the realm of profitability), and the US government continues to work against the deployment of good cryptography.",1365121003

A while ago I wrote that perhaps the greatest contribution the Bitcoin experiment will make to humankind is to teach you and me and our neighbors more about the realities of economics. And later I added that the Bitcoin experiment will also contribute to greater understanding of attack surfaces and online crime. Many of the ideas about how to mine Bitcoins, store Bitcoins, and trade with Bitcoins as a medium of exchange illustrate both the strengths and weaknesses of any other medium of exchange in a world full of human beings. Seeing the discussion of Bitcoins here on Hacker News reminds me of early online discussions in the 1990s of online payment systems such as PayPal, and the arguments beforehand that PayPal wouldn't have to invest a lot of time and effort (as it eventually did) building defenses against theft and fraud. If a weakness in a system is attached to a lot of money, the way to bet is to bet that someone will go looking for that weakness, even if you haven't thought of it.<p>This prompts a question for all the security-knowledgeable persons who participate here on Hacker News, a question once asked of the inventor of Pretty Good Privacy (PGP). How expensive do you think it would be for the United States National Security Agency (or a comparable organization from another national government) to crack a Bitcoin store, given that we know that some Bitcoin caches have already been cracked? And if the organization storing Bitcoin data held personal bank account data too, how attractive a target might it be to thieves?",1365120045

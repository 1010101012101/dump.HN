There are tradeoffs between legibility and power, but never for the sake of safety or artificial consistency.<p>""How does Perl [C++] put the focus onto the creativity of the programmer? Very simple. Perl [C++] is humble. It doesn't try to tell the programmer how to program. It lets the programmer decide what rules today, and what sucks. It doesn't have any theoretical axes to grind. And where it has theoretical axes, it doesn't grind them. Perl [C++] doesn't have any agenda at all, other than to be maximally useful to the maximal number of people.<p>...<p>Many modern computer languages aspire to be minimalistic. They either succeed in being minimalistic, in which case they're relatively useless, or they don't succeed in being truly minimalistic, in which case you can actually solve real problems with them. A number of languages give lip service to the idea of minimalism, but merely sweep the complexity of the problem under the carpet of the programmer. C is a minimalistic language, but only if you don't count all the libraries that are necessary to use it usefully. C++ is obviously not trying to be minimalistic. Unix is considered by some to be a minimalistic operating system, but the fact of the matter is that if you think of Unix as a programming language, it's far richer than even Perl. Perl is, by and large, a digested and simplified version of Unix. Perl is the Cliff Notes of Unix.""<p><a href=""http://www.wall.org/~larry/pm.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wall.org/~larry/pm.html</a>",1206892078

A very small segment of the population can ""hear"" radio waves at certain frequencies (they experience it as a subjective tone very high up in the 15khz range, even if they can't normally hear that high up).<p>But most people who are placed in controlled and blinded experiments to see if they can detect EMF find that they cannot. There is no good evidence that EMF hypersensitivity is anything more than stress, and seeing a psychiatrist would be of more help to you in this scenario.<p>Alternatively, I hear homeopathic practitioners are still getting state funding in the UK.

150142,comment,150070,150126,0,0,KirinDave,,,"Perhaps, but the Independent has a long history of posting spurious health and environment articles (e.g., ""Mobile phone threat to honeybees"", which was a massive press misunderstanding because CCD was such a headline-grabber at the time). Guilt by association is a real and valid reason to dismiss a news article about a complex scientific subject. Even the article itself mentions the general line:<p>> Late last week, the Mobile Operators Association dismissed Khurana's study as ""a selective discussion of scientific literature by one individual"". It believes he ""does not present a balanced analysis"" of the published science, and ""reaches opposite conclusions to the WHO and more than 30 other independent expert scientific reviews"".<p>People talk about the dangers of radiation, but electromagnetic radiation isn't the same kind of radiation we generally worry about. Anything that uses electricity and wires creates this kind of radiant energy, including pacemakers and implantable defibrillators.<p>That doesn't mean there is no potential for health risks, but thus far the science suggests no significant increase in risk. What's more, the mechanism for such health risks is likewise unclear as the wavelengths for cellphone radiation are quite long. It's also unclear why cellphones would cause problems but people living near radio transmitters wouldn't (and we'd have probably seen these effects by now, radio isn't exactly new).<p>Unfortunately, it takes a lot of work and a lot of time to build up long term clinical studies. In the meantime, all we can do is wait.",1206891541

Other people like learning by practice, as well as from books. Some people actually go to school and get degrees in comp sci.

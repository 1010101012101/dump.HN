2247142,comment,2245765,2247095,0,0,danudey,,,"Well I found even outside of actual relationships, people in Vancouver are much friendlier. I moved to Vancouver from Montreal with a roommate who'd grown up in Montreal, and it took her well over a year to accept the fact that when people in Vancouver are nice to you, smile, etc. they're not being fake, they're actually being nice. She didn't understand, because it doesn't happen in Montreal.<p>In Vancouver, I find that people will be more open to starting (or participating in) conversations on the bus, being asked for directions, chatting at a cafe (including baristas, cashiers, etc.), and so on. In Montreal, even with those people who did speak English, the attitude I saw from people was generally 'get out of my face'.<p>People in Montreal, in my experience, are absorbed in themselves and have no interest in anyone around them. They won't (as a rule) try to strike up a conversation on the street, they won't offer to help you if you're having trouble e.g. carrying a package, they won't hold doors. There are exceptions, but they're much more rare than in Vancouver, where everyone generally seems pretty content with their lives and is happy to lend a smile or a helping hand or a compliment to someone they've never met before or will again.<p>The other reason I enjoy Vancouver quite a bit (aside from the weather) is the living accommodations. It's said that the cost of living in Vancouver is higher, but from my point of view it tends to be pretty close, in the sense that you have to pay more in Vancouver but you also get nicer places. In Montreal, there is no 'damage deposit' when you rent an apartment, so there's much less incentive to be careful when you live in a place. Likewise, if there is a problem after you've left the landlord has to pay for it out of pocket (or try to fight with the tenancy board, which is a futile endeavour for small sums). The places tend to get run down and stay that way for longer. Even most 'renovated' places I saw were below what I'd consider liveable. The cost of renting a place is convenient though, considering that the wages in Montreal are (often considerably) lower than in Vancouver or Toronto.",1298321949

If you are honest and open with them you get a far milder punishment than someone who won't talk. I've seen it in so many case reports.<p>Judges are trying to figure out what kind of person you are. If you are open and honest they figure you made a mistake, but are basically a good person and thus don't need much punishment.<p>On the other hand someone who won't talk is assumed to have a more negative mindset.<p>I don't mean to suggest that not talking is taken as evidence for guilt - guilt is established separately and is not based on your cooperation. But the punishment for that guilt varies depending on your behavior in court and to the cops.<p>A lot of the advice on the internet about not talking to cops etc is aimed at avoiding guilt. And it may work. But it utterly ignores the second half, which to me seems almost as important, and that is punishment.",1298321897
2247137,story,,,1,0,petar,"The dual of meditation = Ashtanga",,"Just a few minutes ago, an article about the benefits of mediation surfaced on the top of Y news: http://j.mp/geJbF8. This sign of community appreciation for the subtle techniques for tuning the mind compelled me share the dual of method of meditation. (Please, do not stop reading upon glimpsing the literally-bastardized term ""yoga"".)<p>I will tell you about Ashtanga, the benefits to the mind of which are tremendous. For lack of a tangible point of comparison, I will liken them to Ritalin-on-Speed on a daily basis.  I have practiced Ashtanga for 4 years daily. Ashtanga is a ""yoga style"" but it has little to do with what you have come to know yoga is.<p>While simplifying the story a little, I will say that Ashtanga is one of two true yoga systems that survive today whose lineage traces back thousands of years into the Indian tradition.<p>Ashtanga is not very popular in the US, because unlike what we've come to know as the relaxing (and essentially lazy) western yoga, it demands much of you, albeit in return for even more.<p>It is a ""system"" (and not a fitness exercise), because it encompasses many aspects ranging from the method of teaching, pose sequences, philosophy of thinking about and maintaining your practice, etc. Every minute detail of Ashtanga (like e.g. the specific sequencing of the poses) has been honed over decades to give you the most effective and gradual entry to a state of physical and mental fitness that everyone, who sees an Ashtanga demonstration, calls ""mind-blowing"".<p>Unlike pretty much any other ""yoga"" in the west, the format of Ashtanga classes is not lead (where everyone performs in sync). Instead, in the Ashtanga room you will see practitioners doing their own sequence (there are different levels) at their own pace and not in sync. The teachers know their students very well and help them at hard poses. Those of you familiar with the psychology of sports will recognize the well-known principle that every individual body and mind learns at a different pace. It is virtually impossible to advance (in pretty much any sport) beyond average unless you work at your own pace, especially at the cruxes.<p>The benefits:<p>After having practiced Ashtanga for a month or so. You will start experiencing the good. Right after the morning classes my mind is an extremely high state of focus for about 4 to 5 hours. Years ago, when I first started, I noticed that on my drive back from the studio I involuntarily remember the geometric configuration of cars that I pass (I drive fast) on the high-way for about a half-mile distance. It is a spectacular feeling of mind.<p>I am only scratching the surface here. A sustained daily practice of Ashtanga keeps your body (all the time) in what doctors call a ""sympathetic mode"" which is sort of the opposite of what normal people experience in their lives, which is called ""para-sympathetic mode"". In lamen terms, this means that all chemical process in the body are working at an energetic rate and your brain is constantly ""hydrated"".<p>I will stop here. And will give you some references:<p>The surviving main source of Ashtanga (and the place where all western teachers of Ashtanga go to learn) is the Ashtanga Yoga Institute in Mysore India:<p><pre><code>  http://kpjayi.org/\n</code></pre>\nIt takes years of practice before anyone can be authorized to teach. This is very much unlike any other yoga teacher certification in the west.<p>You will have to do some work to find Ashtanga near you. Use the Internet. These studios are somewhat clandestine due to the low overall demand.<p>I will give you a link to an Ashtanga demonstration on YouTube. Before you view it, remember this: Unlike most other yoga teaching systems, regular students of Ashtanga who are not natural-born athletes and don't even have athletic builds can achieve and do achieve what you will see in this video:<p><pre><code>  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UcIn2W6ghw\n</code></pre>\n—Petar",1298321877

2247129,comment,2245765,2246692,0,0,ramchip,,,"You seem to be living in Canada, but perhaps somewhere else? Our views are pretty different.<p>I'm a francophone, born in Quebec. I have never seen a francophone (from anywhere in the world) speak in English to another because the accent was too strong. Most francophones in Montreal actually speak pretty bad English, at least once you leave the technical spheres, and any Quebecois can speak something closer to ""international French"" when he knows an European is listening.<p>A large portion of my classmates at university were French people. They had no trouble understanding the local accent. They might be puzzled by some special expressions we have for snow, for ""take a chair"", for shortened forms (""je ne le sais pas""->""jelsépa""), swear words, etc. but nothing that can't be explained fairly quickly. The difference between French from France and from Quebec is important but I'd say comparing it to Cajun is exaggeration. It is not my impression that French people dislike Montreal French, but rather that they find it amusing at first (it sounds like a rural accent) and eventually just get used to it. Many Quebecois humorists and singers are popular in France as well.<p>Franglais is a large debate, but in short, the French are as guilty of it, if not more than the Quebecois. Many words like ""email"" or ""shopping"" tend to be said in English in France but in French in Quebec (""courriel"", ""magasinage"").",1298321726

2247062,comment,2245692,2246956,0,0,OpieCunningham,,,"> All developers use only iStore for any end user transaction. This may be enforced by Apple on the grounds of providing a consistent and safe end user experience. But its is mostly to do with keeping a tight control over the market (end user) and their revenue stream. - Use only iOS for developing any Applications. Ditto said and actual reasons. - And now Apple also wants not only a 30% cut of the App sales (which is fair), but also a further 30% cut of the subscription revenue stream (which the App publishers have rightly described as exceedingly greedy. But it is also ""monopolistic"")<p>>So lets view the fairness arguments again. What would be fair for Apple to do so that they are paid a deserving portion of revenue for their efforts? They could mandate that 1. Any paid for App will not encumber additional subscription revenue share (tax), as long as they do not use Apple's streaming resources (is this 100% possible for subscription services?) 2. Any App which is distributed free, but is paid for by a subscription model, will have a revenue share agreement with Apple.<p>I'm not sure that's an accurate analysis. It appears you want to define Apple (and iOS) as simply a technical infrastructure service provider: bandwidth, disk space, etc. If that were true, iOS would be effectively identical to Android and no one would complain about this 30% because they'd just hop over to Android without a second thought.<p>Apple is providing a service to iOS developers: access to the iOS eco-system. Developers are not required to develop an iOS app, they have numerous other options for distributing their application/service. If they want to leverage the iOS eco-system (installed user base, iOS advertising & marketing that Apple pays for, SDK that Apple has developed and maintains that is often considered rather efficient at enabling development of user-friendly applications, payment processing system that is extremely easy for end-users, etc), those developers must agree to Apple's terms of access. In return, Apple believes they can charge fees for various methods in which a developer may choose to use the wide range of features Apple has created in their iOS eco-system.<p>Readability is, as far as I can determine, nearly identical: they have developed a service that provides access to other people's creative work and Readability charges for that service. As an end user, I don't have to use Readability to access the original creative work. If Readability is ""allowed"" to charge the content owner 30% to give me that special Readability access, why can Apple ""not"" charge the developer 30% to give them access to that special Apple eco-system?<p>My entire point would be moot if Apple required 30% of all revenue from Readability regardless of whether the subscription originated from within the iOS app or from Readability's website - but Apple has not done that, which is exactly why Apple's fee is a fee to access the eco-system (not specifically to use Apple's bandwidth, Apple's storage space, etc).<p>edit: In fact, on further consideration, why is Readability's business model considered fair in and of itself? They provide a mechanism for a publisher to voluntarily sign up to receive the 70% Readability wants to give them - but does that mean Readability will not function on a publishers content if that publisher does not agree? I don't believe Readability is blocking access to content from publishers that have not signed up. Effectively, Readability is extorting publishers: give us 30% or we'll take everything. Apple on the other hand is simply saying: give us 30% or you can't use our service. The latter is blatantly more ""fair"" as it only exists with choice. The former requires publishers to actively use resources to block Readability (on a continuing basis) in order for the publisher to maintain their previously established business model. The publisher's choice has been eliminated. How can Readability justify that?",1298320771

But the sad reality of the matter is that no... not everyone should have the ability to downvote because it's clear that a number of those who do so are motivated by differences in opinions rather than lack of intellectual stimulation.<p>I do realize that the administrators of HN most will likely adjust the threshold over time as they see fit (as they've done previously) but the threshold would be much better suited as a function of time... possibly relative to join date and/or combined with average karma per post (a pretty good indicator of individual worthy contribution)... and maybe even take into (small) account how many upvotes users gives.<p>To prevent decline of these boards - i.e., a ""hivemind"" formed by general disagreements regardless of intellectual substance - I think a dynamic function for the downvoting ability should be in place.

I imagine this will be rather murky for a while for all apps of this sort.<p>What I mean by not the real deal though is that TinyGrab doesn't appear to have much of a presence on iOS devices.  Apple could have possibly said, ""We need 200 hours of additional programming work from you or we'll reject your app in the future"" and they may have bailed.  One indicator of this is their complaints of the $99 developer fee.  I think most successful companies would welcome a small yearly fee simply because it would reduce the number of low quality competing apps entering their market place.  A small yearly fee helps ensure to some degree that the app developer has some serious intentions to create something meaningful.<p>A lot of the complaining is fully justified.  There are other cases like Rhapsody where the company has over 700k subscribers in the US and the CEO has admitted most of these users listen to Rhapsody through an iOS device.  That has real implications for them as a subscriber service with small margins.  In TinyGrab's case though, they could work around the terms of service and still provide access to their user base.  They might have to take a large cut in their subscription fee, or increase their prices, but for a basic screenshot/share service they have options.<p>The fact they are not pursuing those options, or at least publicly saying they won't be, indicates to me they either have a smart PR team that realized the opportunity here or they just are not successful enough on iOS to justify continuing anyways.",1298320523

I also interned in HR for two summers at a medium sized company.<p>After a lot of HR classes and two summers in a 5-person HR office, I was certain that HR was not for me. It's a field that has the potential to be interesting and have a major effect on businesses, but in practice HR is boring (except for the fact that you hear all of the company gossip first) and generally ineffective.<p>The truth is that most of the important stuff that could fall under HR is taken on by managers and executive leadership. The HR department gets the administrative stuff.<p>When I started thinking about my future, I realized that HR couldn't take me anywhere else.

2246956,comment,2245692,2246611,0,0,writetoalok,,,">Why does Readability feel they deserve $0.30 but Apple doesn't? If Apple doesn't deserve $0.30, shouldn't the publisher/writer get the full $1? Without the articles, Readability is worthless. Without Apple, Readability for iOS is worthless.<p>This is an interesting question that deserves thought. Readability provides publishers/writers with an application and a new medium to distribute their efforts. And for their efforts towards building this new medium, they require a 30% of cut from end users cost.<p>- Would publishers/writers be able to publish their content in any other way on the iphone. Of course.\n- Would publishers/writers be better off using another way publishing their content on the iphone. Maybe.<p>Apple provides iOS API for <i>App writers</i> to distribute their efforts (Apps). Apple takes a 30% (or is it 40%?) cut from the App end users cost for their efforts. So far so good, all sounds fair.<p>Now Apple (for whatever reasons; we'll go through them soon) enforces that:<p>- All developers use only iStore for any end user transaction. This may be enforced by Apple on the grounds of providing a consistent and safe end user experience. But its is mostly to do with keeping a tight control over the market (end user) and their revenue stream.\n- Use only iOS for developing any Applications. Ditto said and actual reasons.\n- And now Apple also wants not only a 30% cut of the App sales (which is fair), but also a further 30% cut of the subscription revenue stream (which the App publishers have rightly described as exceedingly greedy. But it is also ""monopolistic"")<p>So lets view the fairness arguments again. What would be fair for Apple to do so that they are paid a deserving portion of revenue for their efforts? They could mandate that\n1. Any paid for App will not encumber additional subscription revenue share (tax), as long as they do not use Apple's streaming resources (is this 100% possible for subscription services?)\n2. Any App which is distributed free, but is paid for by a subscription model, will have a revenue share agreement with Apple.<p>What about the user community and the society as a whole? What is fair for them?\n- It is definitely fair for the user community to have an ability to use their devices (both hard and soft parts of it) in ways that they seem fit, unless of course it harms anyone else. Although I strongly believe in a ""take it as it is or leave it"" argument for Apple, I also believe in a code for fair conduct (think ""consumer rights"") towards consumers.\n- It is healthy for the society as a whole to have ecosystems for software stacks (iOS), application stacks (iOS API and Apps), and content. It is also healthy for society as a whole to have companies like Apple take profit in certain ways that aid their business. However there is some rights for consumers that must be upheld by society. For instance if an iphone leaks acid causing injury to user, then surely Apple will be held accountable in a court. There is some similarity in Apple leaking because of its revenue share causing financial injury to developers.<p>All things said and discussed, what all of this really about is, Apple controlling their user revenue stream, and pricing out its competitors in the application stack.\niTunes <=> music store\niBooks <=> book store\nso on and so forth.<p>A lot of those 30% subscription cuts could be going towards development of Apple's competing applications. Apple is most certainly monopolizing its customer base against other developers in its App market. And Apple invited them in the first place and has misplaced their trust. It is a thin line that they have now crossed without much discussion (public).",1298319270

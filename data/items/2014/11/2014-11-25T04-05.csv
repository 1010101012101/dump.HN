Personally I feel really lucky as a US citizen that incredibly talented people from all over the world are leaving their families to come here and contribute to our workforce. Even if you feel differently I think there is no reason to tie visas to a particular company as it prevents the market from working efficiently. Tech companies have already admitted to price fixing for wages [1] and the H-1B visa can certainly act as a way to prevent other companies from easily hiring your workforce.<p>[1] <a href=""http://time.com/76655/google-apple-settle-wage-fixing-lawsuit/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://time.com/76655/google-apple-settle-wage-fixing-lawsui...</a>",1416890992

If my terminology is off or I&#x27;m over using the word tech, lol, please feel free to correct me, I am eager to learn within this arena.
I am someone fascinated by the idea of creating a start-up using tech, but I have no tech background or experience. I can design a pretty snazzy, aesthetically pleasing site using templates etc., but wouldn&#x27;t know where to begin to build one from the ground up. I have an AMAZING e-commerce start-up idea (don&#x27;t we all though?!). I&#x27;ve tried shopify and similar sites to build a template of what the site would look like, but there are numerous web components I want to add which go beyond the scope of what they offer. I want to have someone come on board to help with that side, and have started looking into a few of those founder-matching sites.<p>I&#x27;m curious as to what people on the other side of the fence might think. Would an e-commerce business be considered a tech start-up? Are they the type of projects a hacker/techie would get behind. Or is it more something you just hire out for an initial build?",1416890823

It could be argued that social democracy naturally lends itself towards corporatism by its very nature.  I&#x27;m not sure why you say &#x27;US-style Corporatist capitalism&#x27; though.. the UK and the rest of Europe were practicing it long before America.  Heck, Thatcher predates Reagan too, if that&#x27;s the angle you had in mind.<p>I think it&#x27;s too soon to judge whether the Lib Dems are ineffective.. they&#x27;re still a young party and are growing faster than either the Tories or Labor (correct me if I&#x27;m wrong there).  The current system does not favor their existence, so electoral reform is their main priority.  The same should be true for all third party movements in the US, as the current system is mathematically predisposed towards two party outcomes.

I observed that the men were much more inclined to pursue an &quot;unusual&quot; activity (ie not what other people are doing)than the women were. It seemed motivated not by feeling &quot;weird&quot; rather it appeared to be motivated to not do something that their friends were not interested in participating with them. From a sense of inclusion they didn&#x27;t spend group time on activities that other members of the group were not interested in.<p>I worked with my middle daughter to build a knitting pattern illustrator in Perl[1]. She and her friends could talk for hours about knitting, which is essentially programming as Jacquard proved, because they all were interested in the ways to produce interesting weaves. My friends were interested in talking about computers when I was a teen because we were interested in machines that could &#x27;compute&#x27;.<p>The question I wonder about is if the disparity goes away when women develop group activities around programming.<p>[1] I liked the pun of using Perl for a knitting application.",1416890663

This is relevant for a couple reasons. Gaming (especially PC gaming) means that you&#x27;re more likely to be tech-savvy because you might wonder why a game is running so slowly on your family PC, and then read cool stuff about why your CPU sucks or something. Video games also can be a &quot;gateway&quot; into tinkering with programming by writing bots or writing your own games. Playing the same game as one of your peers means that you have a common interest, and are more likely to be friends. The more friends you have that are also developers, the more likely you are to feel like you &quot;belong&quot; and that you are in the right field.<p>Now, read this article on how the stereotype that video games are for boys was developed: <a href=""http://www.polygon.com/features/2013/12/2/5143856/no-girls-allowed"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.polygon.com/features/2013/12/2/5143856/no-girls-a...</a><p>It&#x27;s pretty long, but the tl;dr is: Once upon a time, video games (like pong) were designed for the whole family to play. The video game industry bubble popped because people have short attention spans. To try to figure out how to survive, companies like nintendo did a lot of market research and found that more boys were playing video games than girls. It is easier for the marketing team to direct their resources to a specific demographic of people. Since there are more boys than girls who play video games, nintendo starts running marketing campaigns to explicitly target boys in the early 90&#x27;s. Nintendo starts launching products that are literally named the gameboy.<p>The article doesn&#x27;t really go into this at all, but kids started experiencing heavily genderized video game marketing in the early 90&#x27;s, and by the time they choose to major and graduate from college, that roughly maps to the sharp decrease in women in CS starting in the early 2000&#x27;s. This obviously isn&#x27;t the only factor, and also possibly doesn&#x27;t even account for half of it, but I definitely think it&#x27;s a significant factor that nobody really talks about.",1416888940

I know a few developers who are worth $500k/year, if not more. And I know plenty of others who are not worth that, but are easily worth $100k/year. With all of them under the same label of &quot;developer&quot;, it can be hard to distinguish what you&#x27;re getting.<p>Car example! Imagine wanting to buy a car, but not knowing anything about cars. So you call Kia, and ask how much a car costs, and they say, $15,000. Then you call Honda, they say $20,000. A few others, similar prices. Then you call Rolls Royce, and they say $500,000 and you think they&#x27;re trying to pull a fast one on you. And to compound this, if you were to list everything that you want in a car, you&#x27;d probably come up with something closer to a Rolls Royce than a Kia. So you&#x27;re shopping for a Rolls, and you&#x27;ve budgeted for a Kia. Also remember, you don&#x27;t know anything about cars, so you don&#x27;t know how to distinguish important features (ie. wheels, a functioning engine), from luxury ones (ie. a fancy sound system, heated seats).<p>In terms of people not being willing to pay the going rate - plenty are! All of the big west coast tech companies pay handsomely for developers. Outside of big cities though, things are slow to catch up. So I think that a lot of the sentiment comes from people not wanting to move to SF or NYC or Seattle, but also wanting to get a competitive rate. Eventually these companies will have to adapt, but it can take time, especially if there are enough people who don&#x27;t want to leave the city they&#x27;re in. There&#x27;s also the quality divergence taking place - as much as we&#x27;d all like to think we&#x27;re good, Google and co. are very selective.<p>In terms of working for less than the going rate (which as you said is generous) - for sure that&#x27;s happening. But there&#x27;s adverse selection happening there, in that people who are taking jobs below market are either desperate and will quit when they find something better, or are of low quality. Developers aren&#x27;t paid well out of the goodness of the company&#x27;s heart, they&#x27;re paid because they make money for the company. And bad developers can have extremely negative productivity even ignoring their salary.<p>Finally, labor takes time to catch up, especially skilled labor. From no programming knowledge to junior developer at a top company takes typically five years - ie. an undergraduate degree in computer science and some tinkering on your own (yes there are exceptions). And we are seeing supply increase - enrollment in computer science programs is up across the country. Imagine we had a severe shortage of doctors - you can&#x27;t just suddenly triple the supply of doctors over a couple of years. Now if you have a huge shortage of brain surgeons, which might take a decade or more to train you&#x27;re in for a lot of trouble.",1416888776

I&#x27;m guessing it isn&#x27;t that bad since a lot of IT/desk-help and what not have been offshored for a while now.<p>Whenever I read posts of &quot;they want to pay us less&quot; online I try to understand, why wouldn&#x27;t a company simply offshore it? I live in Mexico, and when I was looking for jobs there were a lot of &quot;nearshoring&quot; (just like offshore but sometimes a business guy will go across either border.) companies, so it&#x27;s clearly not that rare.
Why? Because they can afford the same for less (due to exchange rates and what not) So I wonder why they&#x27;d move a lot of &quot;talent&quot; there instead of paying them less (but still considerably more than what an average person gets here) to work for them? Why go through all the trouble of even suggesting reforms and what not? There&#x27;s got to be more to it, no?",1416888541

    moderators failing to distinguish between &#x27;similar&#x27; and
    &#x27;identical&#x27;&quot; problem by making that situation impossible.

  - Improves answer discovery for users: If Google gets you
    to almost, but not quite, the right question, 
    cross-referencing gets you the rest of the way.

  - Improves answer discovery for users: Maybe the best answer
    today isn&#x27;t the same as the best answer 5 years ago.

  - Improves gamification: Rewards are the lifeblood of
    a site like Stack Overflow.  A way of dealing with
    duplicate questions that rewards users for 
    cross-referencing them is infinitely more in line with
    SE&#x27;s basic idea than one that punishes them with
    public shaming. 

  - Reduces opportunity for petty bureaucrats to take root.

  - Represents a more thoughtful, measured way of thinking
    about software engineering.  Many questions really can
    have more than one correct answer, or the correct answer
    can depend on subtle details.  Which answer gets the
    green check mark may have as much to do with the situation
    of the asker than the quality of the answer.</code></pre>",1416888382

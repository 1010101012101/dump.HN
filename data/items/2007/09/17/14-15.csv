55693,comment,55381,55381,0,0,iamelgringo,,,"I've been using VMWare on the desktop for over a year.  It's just good software, and a joy to develop on.  <p>I can develop on whatever OS I want, and not have to worry about multiple monitor support, or other sticky install issues.  I don't have to worry about not having a decent Office suite. <p>I can set up a server on a VM, poke around on it, and throw it away and start over.  I can clone a server and try different setups that vary from the base.  I can move a server from one box to another without problems.   <p>When I get to the point of having my apps out there, I'm certainly going to have my servers virtualized.  It's a no brainer for me.  <p>If you want to try it out, VMware server is a free dowload.  <a href=""http://www.vmware.com/products/server/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vmware.com/products/server/</a>",1190040785

55685,comment,54901,55077,0,0,hhm,,,"It's rather creepy. The vision of yourself in the mirror tends to be distorted, and if not (in my case was not), it gets distorted with movement. As if the brain couldn't process it well, or something like that. And usually, in dreams, going into surfaces makes all your surroundings change (at least that was what happened to me, it was like teleporting).<p>Google for Lucid Dreaming and Mirrors, it'll get you to very interesting results.",1190040049

55680,comment,55556,55556,0,0,chmac,,,"I'd suggest you go focused rather than shotgun. Who are your target customers? What other sites are they using? Are you a cross between eBay and Facebook? Who are the biggest bloggers out there on those topics? Target those people, like a laser beam, you should be able to guarantee coverage on launch day.<p>Plus, you should be able to generate some hype beforehand. Start targetting these sites now. Tell them the launch is coming. Build the relationship. Make sure the authors know who you are and that you're coming.<p>Oh, and in 4-6 weeks means nothing, pick a date. Pick a date in 8 weeks so you can be sure you hit it, but a date, an actual date, a timeframe is always meaningless.<p>So you've targetted the top bloggers in the field, now offer them something. Tell them you're coming, then offer the top blogger a 4 hour exclusive if they'll guarantee coverage. Offer them all a sneak preview. Delay your launch by 3 days and run 3 days of ""private, invite only beta testing"". Tell all the bloggers you're targetting that they can invite people, on their blogs.<p>The people you're targetting (bloggers, not customers) have to feel like they're getting something real, something that's a scoop, not some generic, third hand, run of the mill announcement.<p>Second, target forums / user groups / fan sites / etc. Anything in the eBay / MySpace / Facebook / etc space, if there's a forum out there, find their news section, add them to your list above. Then get an account on the forum and start talking (try to keep it relevant, spam never helped anyone).<p>Scrap the ""Coming soon"" on your site and start a big, fat counter. LAUNCHING IN 45/44/43 DAYS, etc.<p>Generate some hype, get people excited, this thing is going to happen, it's going to be huge, and you want to get into it right now.<p>Most of all, good luck!",1190039354

Either it would be an example where you want hygiene, and the Scheme version would look way better, or it would be an example where you don't want hygiene, and the CL version would look way better.<p>Not having hygiene can be convenient, e.g. if you want to introduce a binding that will be used by the calling code, and don't want the calling code to have to specify the variable name every time, e.g. the aif macro.",1190039176

8703679,comment,8703381,8703381,0,0,schrijver,,,"The lack of a module system in JavaScript is at the heart of many of these problems. While ES6 promises a solution to this, uptil now the ecosystem is fragmented unduly because of this: there’s multiple competing ways to create JavaScript modules.<p>Otherwise, you can avoid a lot of hassle by skipping over the pre-proccesor trends. For example, templating languages come and go, and there’s lots of transpiled languages like CoffeeScript, also new CSS pre-proccesors appear regularly… In our agency of designer/developers we stick to HTML based templating like Jinja, Django templates or Handlebars. We don’t use Coffeescript, and we only started using a CSS preprocessor when LESS arrived, which used the same syntax as CSS.<p>All these tools might be great when you are working by your self, but I see it as detrimental in collaborative settings. Working in small rapidly changing teams, the amount of new stuff you can learn per project is just limited. So why reinvent JS, CSS and HTML when you know that is the stuff that is going to stick around…<p>Finally, working with JavaScript one toolchain that I found that succeeds at hiding a lot of this complexity from the developer is Meteor. They did it by creating their own package manager—yet again :( But they remove a lot of friction of build scripts and front-/back end discrepancies. Meteor is firmly rooted in the <i>now</i> though, 15-20 years is a long time :)",1417773557

The issue with academia has always been its ROI. You invest a lot into the academic life, your time, your youth, your energy, your mental state, all to graduate close to 30 make a salary some of the people you tutor make fresh out of college? All while working 50-60 hour weeks...it isn&#x27;t quite the life.<p>Perhaps being in a start-up requires such dedication too, but that can be seen a risk that can yield a great reward. For academe, there is no reward, save the &quot;academic points.&quot;<p>This [1] says it well. At least if you work hard and stress and have no life in the &quot;real world&quot;, you&#x27;d have the chance of monetary compensation. Really, in academia, unless you are lucky enough to become a tenure prof, all you have is your pride that you understand something no else cares to.

Heck, I&#x27;m working on one myself.  Always wanted to, so why not?<p>That expansion capability meant an Apple 2 made for a great 8 bit workstation, and an awful lot of Atari related development happened on the more usable Apple 2.<p>I think the technical capabilities of machines like the Atari were really noteworthy at that time.  But, the Apple 2 did just enough.  6 colors on the high-res screen, for example, was just enough.  You can do anything in 6 colors, but it&#x27;s harder to do it in 4...<p>Today, I can fire up that machine, write some stuff, save it to a USB thumb drive, plug that into my PC, get the disk image open, get the data and go.

There have been articles on HN recently that made a strong case for the genetic basis of IQ and for its validity as a measure of intelligence. It&#x27;s also easy to find data about the average measured IQ in different racial groups. But there are also a variety of arguments that weaken or strengthen the case, from the Flynn effect to studies on twins, adopted children, etc. It seems to me that the issue is muddled, at best. If there is a slam-dunk argument that can finally bury the notion of intelligence differences between races, I&#x27;d like to see it articulated.<p>Disclaimer: I do not belong to the race with the highest supposed IQ, and I have never taken an IQ test myself, so I really have no horse in this race. Also, even if racial differences in intelligence were real, individual differences would still be more important, and it would remain unacceptable to make assumptions about someone&#x27;s intelligence based on their race.",1417773229

The unification of hangouts and SMS allowed me to control which medium my messages took, which saves me a lot of money and allows me to stay in touch wherever I am in the world.  Before, I had to straddle two apps to make this happen.  With Hangouts, it&#x27;s all one interface and conversation threads are combined.",1417770737

The &quot;egalité&quot; of the French society is theoretically classless, meaning there isn&#x27;t the concept of a &quot;servant&quot; class. So everyone is equal in terms of the customer -- waiter dynamic. Interestingly, in my town of Avignon, I am somewhat well known among the restaurants I frequent and thus it isn&#x27;t unusual to have chats with the waiters, but it&#x27;s more like colleagues chatting as opposed to that fake/friendliness you get in a place like Chile&#x27;s. I mightn&#x27;t have articulated my idea well due to my time constraints today, but the net point is that there&#x27;s a cultural difference based on societal &quot;role&quot; as opposed to grubbing for tips. That isn&#x27;t to demean other cultures (I used to be the chatty American bartender in the US back in the day,) -- it just is what it is.",1417770008

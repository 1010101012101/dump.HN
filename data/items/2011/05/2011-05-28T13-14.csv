You could push client bugs with erroneous API calls, or server-side bugs that cause data loss. Rolling back isn't enough to fix the damage. The user's data has reached a permanent bad state that they didn't intentionally reach. You could roll back the data of every person who used the change, which would undo all of their work. You could analyze the data and try to fix it. This might work, or it might get the user data into a different bad state.<p>Plus, bugs in the view of the site might not cause errors that pop up in your error console, since it's hard to write tests for ""looks wrong."" Obvious errors - ""when I click on my profile picture my name disappears"" - are caught by external people instead of internal people, which adds a level of indirection between a problem appearing and a fix being written.<p>That being said, there are great uses for gradual rollouts. The video mentions that they do this for mature features with Gatekeeper - the developer can conditionally enable a Prod feature, and see what it does.",1306591110

I don't know how it is in UO, but afaik from other news from last years, where apparel companies sold copied flickr/blog/digart/etc creation, they don't do such stuff in-house, they buy it from outside (some sort of providers, companies or freelancers, don't know). I think it's a common practice for cheap modern apparell - well, creation and production must be cheap. Sometimes bought derivatives happen to be ripoffs, f.ex. look at this example (it's in Polish, but just look at the images on the left) <a href=""http://wyborcza.biz/biznes/1,101562,8016144,Amerykanka_oskarza_Reserved_o_kradziez_zdjecia.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wyborcza.biz/biznes/1,101562,8016144,Amerykanka_oskar...</a><p>Just look at those cases <a href=""http://youthoughtwewouldntnotice.com/blog3/?cat=5"" rel=""nofollow"">http://youthoughtwewouldntnotice.com/blog3/?cat=5</a> The case above is just one of dozens that are brought to daylight and probably hundreds that don't.

I'd say Lua's coroutines are a bigger feature for asynch. development, though.<p>I wrote an embedded non-blocking / event-loop webserver in Lua as part of one of my projects (a distributed filesystem). I got sidetracked by other projects, and lost interest in writing non-blocking webservers after I got into Erlang, but plan on getting back to the filesystem soon. If I find time to neaten up that code, are you interested in swapping notes?<p>One tricky part is error handling - I spent a lot of time on that (and was pretty impressed by Erlang's error handling model).

2594413,comment,2593265,2593265,1,0,zeynel1,,,"There is a big scientific discovery, so far unknown to the general public, that you may be interested to know. The discovery was made by Isaac Newton. But instead of revealing his discovery to the world, Newton hid it in his Principia as a secret code. The discovery itself is as important as the realization that the earth moved; or Galileo's observation that the Moon is not a perfect body as believed by Scholastic Doctors of Philosophy of his time.<p>Newton discovered that what I call ""Kepler's Rule"" is the definition of density. This realization leads to the conclusion that we are living in a matterless world; and effectively reduces Newtonism to a religious cult teaching occult as true science.<p>You can read more about Newton's discovery in my blog <a href=""http://science1.wordpress.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://science1.wordpress.com/</a>",1306589974

I wonder if they have a lot of hairy merge conflicts around release time due to that, and bugs in production resulting purely from those merge conflicts. Or worse, subtle bugs resulting in change A going out, but being programmed against a function that was changed in change B, which is not going out because the author of change B isn't in today.",1306588004

I don't really like the idea of allowing VCs to decide who is allowed to come to the US.  Of course, I don't really like the idea that employers having this power either.<p>This could distort the market and suppress what I think is a very healthy trend toward bootstrapping in high tech.  Not that bootstrapping is necessarily better than funding - in many cases, I'm sure it isn't.  But the decision to accept funding (and the terms of that funding) should be based on what's good for the business, not whether the founders need a VCs permission to live in the US.<p>Obviously VCs are very relevant in software, but with the drop in cost of starting a business, software entrepreneurs may need them less and less... unless, of course, they need a visa.

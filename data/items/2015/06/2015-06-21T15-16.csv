US corporations (and people for that matter) only pay the difference between any foreign tax collected and our own federal tax when they move it to domestic books.<p>Probably more importantly, the foreign profits are disproportionately gains baised on research and development conducted in the US which the foreign subsidiaries pay no royalty for at all.<p>If, for instance, 50% of the value of an iPhone sold in China represents the value of the engineering of the device, we have a tax loss which adds up to half of the nearly $200 Billion held as foreign profits by Apple.<p>Apple should be forced to pay these taxes.  This represents a real and tangible loss to the people in the US and an unnecessary subsidy handed to the most valuable public company on earth.",1434902397

Even if they did they wouldn&#x27;t be able to evaluate it. HR are simply brokers.<p>It is a board-level decision on salary ranges that prevents you from hiring &quot;at market&quot;.<p>Clearly there will always be some excellent developers at any given moment, available to work sub-market for their own, irrelevant reasons - and these will be the &quot;unicorns&quot;, and typically your dev team will be full of them (somewhat by definition because they have already been hired by the unicorn-finding process).<p>The question as to why many (most?) highly profitable companies refuse to &quot;pay market&quot; is very interesting and I do not have a good answer to.<p>The best I can come up with is that actually the company (i.e. the important people in the company: the board) explicitly doesn&#x27;t want to pay for the best (or even above average) candidates, through some recognition/perception that they &quot;do not need the best&quot;. But the development team <i>does</i> want to hire good guys, and so you have a kind of stand-off by proxy between the technical team and the board via HR.<p>The board may be focussed on a buy-out, or this year&#x27;s figures or making some kind of an exit. I very much doubt the board for most companies sees developers as anything other than a fungible commodity.<p>Add in the fact that developers are seen as subordinates to management, and that many developers are already approaching or at their managers&#x27; (often low-ish) salaries(1), and I think advertised developer salaries will continue to be massively under-market (there are of course exceptions).<p>(1)Of course managers often get 100% bonuses while developers do not, so this is an untruth, but humans are emotion-driven and so this barrier remains. Realise that companies will happily pay way more than 2,000 USD <i>per day</i> for the very same resources they will not recruit for more than 75,000 <i>per year</i>, and the picture is complete.<p>The situation is exacerbated by our inability as a field to successfully discriminate between good and bad hires and our resultant desperate, near religious avoidance of false positives in the hiring process.",1434902391

The will go through weeks of training. Some make it, some don&#x27;t.<p>The majority, if not all, of the incoming (just of of college) class did not major or obtain a degree in anything sales related (business, management, accounting, marketing, etc.). Most of them graduated with mechanical engineering degrees. Why? Because it is easier to train and teach someone how to sell than it is to teach some the technical details (physics) of HVAC systems. It is also easier to sell when you know and understand the product you are selling. Most of the units sold are custom built for the particular building they are being used on/in.<p>Likewise, it is easier to train or teach someone a new programming language than it is to change or modify someone&#x27;s attitude and personality.",1434902375

9753870,comment,9752130,9753053,0,0,JesperRavn,,,"The article was focussed on the profitability of recycling per se, and not the total impact on the environment.  The article implied that the reason thin contains are a problem is because they contain less material and therefore yield less profit for the recycler.  But if that is the only reason that thin containers are a problem, then the total impact on the environment would still be lower with thin containers, since not using the material in the first place is more efficient that using more and recycling more.<p>So a policy that bans thin containers on the basis that they result in less profits for recyclers is the opposite of smart.  The end goal is to lower the total environmental impact,  not profitable recycling programs.",1434902307

9753861,comment,9750808,9752147,0,0,dreamcompiler,,,"I completely disagree. If all the languages I&#x27;d used had been in the Algol family (as most &quot;mainstream&quot; languages are) I might agree with you, since there&#x27;s not much qualitative difference between them. But some languages are so different that they change the way you think about programming, and those new ways of thinking improve your skill in every language.
For example, Forth taught me about threaded, stack-based code. It&#x27;s a very different metaphor than assembler or C and it runs just as fast.
Icon (the language) showed me what you can do when failure is a first class notion and everything is a generator. (Icon is monad-based programming, although that word wasn&#x27;t used when Icon was invented.)
Prolog taught me what you can do with declarative programming, pattern-matching, and unification. Prolog is not really a general-purpose language, but it&#x27;s a mind-blowingly elegant way to solve some classes of problems. (Prolog is the world&#x27;s best database query language, for example. SQL feels like primitive torture by comparison.)
Lisp taught me the virtues of lambda calculus, functional programming, programs as data, macros, and ubiquitous composition. After I learned Lisp I thought I understood functional programming.<p>And then I learned Haskell, which cranks FP all the way to 11. You can curry in Lisp, but Haskell does it <i>automatically</i>. And then there are monads, which (spoiler alert) really are not about I/O. They&#x27;re much more general than that.
Knowing all this stuff has made me a better, more productive programmer in every language I use.",1434902094
9753860,comment,9752948,9753721,0,0,avn2109,,,"Interesting link, but $11 million bucks is probably not enough to buy even a single Senator, even if his district is an extremely cheap media market.<p>A recent Senate campaign in one of the nation&#x27;s cheapest media markets (Jon Tester&#x27;s) was run for ~15 million bucks[0] in coordinated campaign funds, plus probably-larger undisclosed amounts of &quot;independent&quot; campaign funding through PAC&#x27;s etc.<p>In the same cheap media market, Senator Max Baucus raised >$5 million[1] for the coordinated campaign in his final Senate race, in which he ran effectively unopposed. Again this $5 million does not account for his pre-existing war chest from thirty five years of Senate campaigns or the (vastly larger) fundraising of his GlacierPAC or other related &quot;independent&quot; political organizations.<p>So the minimum single-senator campaign cost is probably somewhere between those two bounds. Therefore I don&#x27;t regard the core idea of Mayday PAC as a failure; instead it seems like they need to scale it before we can decide if it&#x27;s workable.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/summary.php?cid=n00027605#fundraising"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/summary.php?cid=n0002...</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/summary.php?cid=n00004643"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/summary.php?cid=n0000...</a>",1434902083

9753855,comment,9751989,9752413,0,0,VLM,,,"&quot;Employers overvalue experience&quot;<p>Only at hiring time.  One of the execs reads a journalist article in a trade rag about any random fad and &quot;we&quot; need to have it implemented yesterday.  Which is not a problem because successful employees are really good at OTJ training and learn by experimentation.  Unfortunately no one has told HR that, and they think they&#x27;re hiring for tax audit avoidance accountants in the most conservative and uncreative criteria possible.<p>The ideal candidate has 20 years of experience in a field 10 years old (that only takes 6 weeks to learn of course), in other words focused entirely on the past.  The ideal employee on the other hand is an expert at learning &quot;6 week&quot; technologies and making them produce once they&#x27;re hired.  There&#x27;s going to be friction and failure and massive wastes of money.<p>There is also the extremely low social status issue.  It would be possible to micro-specify (nano-specify?) any management or executive job, but they&#x27;re not going to put up with it, as an industry, so instead we get &quot;good judgment&quot; type of hiring criteria.  The reason why programmers have incredibly low social status is the oversupply (nationwide, anyway) requires them to be talked down to or replaced by someone who will tolerate being talked down to.  The extremely low social status permeates the rest of the field too, call center like work environments, crazy disrespectful deadlines, poor management techniques (most modern fads, really), so its not going to be as simple as some sort of union saying &quot;no&quot; to disrespectful job advertisements.",1434901946

9753778,comment,9753366,9753366,0,0,uxcn,,,"It&#x27;s generally difficult to say one language is <i>faster</i> than another, but there are some significant differences between the languages and implementations of Python and C/C++ that have very real performance implications.<p>Python is a dynamically typed language.  This means that the language will handle conversions between types depending on the context.  For example, one context can yield a 64 bit integer, another a arbitrary precision integer, another a string.  Keeping track of when to use one versus another, and converting between costs performance.  The different data representations for each type have different performance implications as well.  For example, a 64 bit integer can fit into a register, and it&#x27;s generally only one cycle to perform any math on it.  Arbitrary precision requires math and carry be performed for every digit in the value.  With C++, types are explicit, which means there is only one type for a value, and the representation is generally the most efficient (eg 64 bit integer).<p>Python is also generally interpreted.  This means that code can&#x27;t be directly executed on the CPU.  An intermediate layer, called the interpreter takes an intermediate representation of the Python code, and translates it into instructions that run on the CPU.  This happens at runtime, which adds overhead for each intermediate instruction.  The more instructions you need to do something, the more overhead you have.  C/C++ is compiled directly into code that executes on the CPU which is typically faster.  This also allows for higher levels of optimization in code, since there&#x27;s an understanding of what a piece of C/C++ code will look like when it executes on the CPU.  The compiler can also optimize the code further, since it knows the code (generally) won&#x27;t change.  It&#x27;s also a lot easier to use native features of the CPU like stack allocation, which is drastically faster than heap allocation.<p>One of the other differences is that Python tends to provide higher levels of abstraction than C/C++ code.  So, doing something like a set intersection using <i>x.intersection(y)</i> may not necessarily be the fastest way.  Python may do a hashed compare, but sorting and using <i>memcmp</i> may be faster.  It&#x27;s a lot more code to write though.

Apple lacks confidence in rolling this out - they don&#x27;t even know if they&#x27;d make back their money using a loss leader of this magnitude. They don&#x27;t feel that the service alone has any meaningful advantage over the competition, so they feel a need to compensate with an extraordinarily long trial period, and they&#x27;re willing to abuse some of their market power to strong-arm content producers into (hopefully) covering the bill. As a tiny part of their overall business strategy, they are unwilling to make any large bets on it, regardless of their ability to cover a loss.<p>- or -<p>2. (probably more likely) Apple is so myopically over-confident that they believe this service will disrupt the music industry in the same way the App Store changed software distribution. They honestly feel that they are creating a <i>new</i> market here, not trying to steal market share from other streaming services. Consequently, they don&#x27;t feel a need to justify covering any expense to content producers because in Apple&#x27;s mind, content producers will give anything for the <i>privilege</i> of existing on Apple&#x27;s revolutionary new service.

Yes, I know CCP does it, but from what I&#x27;ve heard their engine is C++, and even then it&#x27;s been a long, uphill battle. You&#x27;re just going to have a very hard time meeting soft-realtime performance constraints (e.g. 30ms or 15ms frames) if very much of your code is in python.<p>If you&#x27;re doing a programming challenge, you&#x27;ll probably be fine? I&#x27;ve never done a programming challenge, but my assumption is that getting a result is the goal, and the performance of the code that gets it isn&#x27;t that big of a deal, so long as it runs in a reasonable amount of time.<p>Really, the point is that you aren&#x27;t going to see algorithmic-level speed differences between C/C++ and python most of the time. There are cases where this is untrue (e.g. where the algorithm relies on low level memory control), but it&#x27;s true enough. You&#x27;ll see a constant factor speedup, ranging somewhere between small and massive. I&#x27;ve heard 100x is typical for code that runs mostly in python and isn&#x27;t just calling out to C, C++, or Fortran.<p>That said, the 100x number could be way off. For compute intensive tasks, if you&#x27;re using numpy, you&#x27;ll see a much smaller speedup. If you&#x27;re not using numpy, but are great at writing multicore and simd code, you could see a 100<i>(num_vector_lanes)</i>(num_cores), so on a recent quad-core intel chip, you might be able to get a 100<i>8</i>4 = 3200x speedup. This would take a long time to write, only applies to problems that are both compute-bound and easily parallelizable, and could be overly optimistic, but you get the idea (I don&#x27;t know where the 100x number comes from, and how well the C++ programs it was compared with were written -- if it&#x27;s from Alioth, last I checked they tended to leave a lot of perf on the table, but are not too bad).<p>Also, cache friendliness can make a massive difference. I&#x27;ve seen 10x speedups in C++ programs by utilizing the cache better, and I&#x27;ve heard of people getting even more significant speedups. Python&#x27;s implementation is extremely cache unfriendly, <i>but</i> writing cache friendly C++ programs is non-obvious to a lot of programmers (or they don&#x27;t consider it, or something), so you might loose out here. Along these lines, if your memory allocation patterns in C++ are naive, your code won&#x27;t perform very well, and a lot of C++ programmers fall victim to this.<p>So who knows. If you&#x27;re great at C/C++, know your architecture, are excellent at parallization and SIMD, and have the right problem, the difference could be massive. Barring that, I&#x27;d guess you&#x27;d get something like a 10x-50x speed up for average code, which is a lot, but maybe not that significant<p>Sort of rambled there, hope that made sense.<p>P.S. A lot of this is only true for CPython. I hear PyPy is faster (still no simd, multicore, or memory allocation or layout control though, so I suspect you can still beat it a lot of the time).",1434900033

The first is that you are reciting anecdotes from 1400 years ago; there is absolutely no proof of anything you said. Even if we accept that the Quran was given to Mohammed by God, we have to at least acknowledge the possibility that a lot of what you&#x27;ve learned has been added in by various persons over the course of many hundreds of years i.e. we cannot be so sure about anything that is written down, by anyone, at any time, especially from something as old as the Quran. And to be clear, that applies to all writing, the Bible, etc.<p>The second is that no, believing ANYBODY about ANYTHING, no matter how eloquently put, is foolish to say the least. It doesn&#x27;t make a difference if they are my parent or not, never mind some professor or total stranger. The only person who can decide if something is right or not is YOU. Belief should not be based on how charismatic anyone is, that is irrelevant. Unfortunately, you have total responsibility for your actions and opinions and it is inexcusable to believe anyone or anything without first exploring your doubt. And even then it is up to you to walk the line of what should be believed and what should be questioned.",1447786793

At most, given complete trust of the judgement of the FBI and assumption of their policy objectives being aligned with risk to Americans and assumption that there are no factors other than risk weighing into what they draw public attention to, it gives you information on the relative risk attached to <i>individual terrorists</i>. But, even then, if there are relatively fewer Islamic groups posing danger to Americans, and each of those groups is more dependent on a narrow set of senior leaders for effectiveness, then members of Islamic groups could be dominate the 10 most wanted list by being the individuals responsible for the most risk, even while Christian groups are collectively responsible for greater risk.<p>> Contrary to your claim that the DoJ is downplaying domestic terrorism<p>I didn&#x27;t claim that DoJ is downplaying domestic terrorism.<p>What I stated is that they don&#x27;t issue press releases as frequently, and don&#x27;t highlight organizational ties in the press releases they do issue, for the actual specific arrests or specific investigations of homegrown Christian terrorists in the way they do for arrests or specific investigations of Islamic terrorists tied to international groups.<p>This is actually in <i>tension</i> with the DoJ&#x27;s portrayals of the <i>overall</i> risk from domestic, non-Islamic groups (I suggest a possible motive for this inconsistency in my early post, though that is pure speculation.)",1447786655

They don&#x27;t pay well, even by lower-cost-of-living Midwest standards. Yet they do all of the same nonsense that companies do in larger urban areas: open-plan office layouts (even when private working space out here is much cheaper than the already cost-effective prices you&#x27;d pay for it in a city), Agile/Scrum crap, various over emphasized alcohol-based social functions, ping pong tables, etc.<p>Why would a talented person stay around here for that?

The Soviet design took a different tack and invested more in automation, dooming some cosmonauts but being probably for the best long-term.<p>Nowadays we know how to do some things very, very well--rendezvous--so heavy automation makes sense. In other areas that are more research projects pilot in the loop still makes sense.<p>It&#x27;s a tradeoff of efficiency for flexibility and fault tolerance.",1447786373

But in return you pay with a great source of nondeterminism that can cause maddening bugs, break replays, and hinder synchronization in networked games.<p>>so long as people keep vsync on (why do you need framerate greater than your monitor&#x27;s refresh rate anyway...)<p>Two things going on here. Vsync is theoretically a great idea (that worked perfectly in practice on countless simpler platforms in the past), but due to driver flaws and the realities of preemptive multitasking introduces a noticeable additional frame or two of latency on every PC I&#x27;ve used in the past decade or so, whether playing a game or just using regular desktop applications. My guess is that the OS scheduler isn&#x27;t precise enough to keep applications from barely missing a present deadline (thus causing unnecessary stuttering), so driver devs force triple buffering when vsync is enabled to compensate, giving you a smooth but unresponsive presentation. It really sucks that I have to toggle desktop composition (and thus, vsync) on and off to fix stuttering in one application or tearing in another, but somewhere in the Lovecraftian horror that is Windows, someone screwed up.<p>The other is &quot;why do you need framerate greater than your monitor&#x27;s refresh rate anyway,&quot; and the answer is &quot;to provide the lowest latency and smoothest presentation possible within the constraints of a preemptive multitasking OS.&quot; In a perfect world, a game would know exactly how long it would take to simulate and render a frame, and would wait as long as possible before doing so, so that the most up-to-date input from the keyboard, mouse, and network could be used to display a frame with the least amount of latency factored into it to the player. This is not a perfect world, but you can get a similar effect (at a greater CPU and GPU cost) by rendering multiple superfluous frames, so that whichever one happens to be presented is much closer to the ideal than the one you&#x27;d see if you rendered the frame at the start of the 16ms then yielded for the rest of it.<p>This is part of why you often see &quot;pro e-sports&quot; types turning the graphics settings down to comical levels, by the way. Not only to lessen the threat of a completely missed frame due to a spike in visual complexity, but also so that they can run their game with the framelimiter off.",1447786005

Even more so if you come from banlieues. With no job prospects and isolation from mainstream society, some Muslim youths retreat to religion and out of those, some discover and/or led to radical ideologies.<p>If you read the article, you&#x27;ll see that there are some Muslims who are trying to rescue these youths. I feel this could be part of an actually  solution. Since Muslim youth won&#x27;t trust outsiders at all, the government can provide Muslim community leaders some resources to intervene in the lives of youths that are going down the wrong paths from crime to radicalization.<p>Also, they can consider setting up programs for parents to identify the signs of radicalization and educate them about how to intervene and de-escalate. Apparently, a father of one of the Paris attackers even went all the way to Syria to persuade his son to come home. Even after offering him a plan where he didn&#x27;t have to go to prison but could resettle in Algeria and try to rebuild his life, the son refused.

ISIS/Da&#x27;esh is an organization that has intentions to kill people, and is essentially a singleton in that regard even if it influences people to kill in packs of autonomous cells (&quot;autonomous&quot; used loosely, they&#x27;re on the Internet and talk to each other).<p>Climate change, on the other hand, doesn&#x27;t really have a central bureau that seeks to engineer more climate change.

10582906,comment,10578244,10578244,0,0,itnAAnti,,,"I&#x27;ve been in this situation a few times in the last several years, where I have had a good, but not good-enough player, and I have tried a new approach to the dismissal each time. What follows is what I should have done in every instance.<p>First, go with your gut and end it ASAP, do not try to mentor, do not try to grow them, just end it and move on. I have spent too much time, effort, and money trying to bring the performance of B-players up to A-player status. If someone has hustle, then you can point out shortcomings and they will stay up all night making it perfect. That&#x27;s an A-player in the rough; don&#x27;t cut those players. If you point out shortcomings and they continue to deliver mediocrity over and over, cut them and move on.<p>Recognize who is ambitious and who is not, and place people in appropriate roles. There&#x27;s nothing wrong with people who lack ambition, but they can&#x27;t hold critical roles in high-performing teams, they drag the ambitious, hard-working, self-motivated A-players down.<p>I agree with many other commenters that the right thing to do is to be honest that it&#x27;s not going to work out, and offer a severance package. I disagree with some severance numbers that have been suggested... the standard number is a week of severance for each year of service - that&#x27;s what I go with.<p>However, if the person made significant concessions to work with you, for example, if they moved their family cross-country to take the job with you, then more severance is appropriate. &quot;Make them whole&quot;.<p>As for delivering the message, my advice is the Band-Aid approach, make it succinct, do it in a place where their co-workers can&#x27;t overhear, and plan their exit in a way that they don&#x27;t run into other co-workers. You don&#x27;t want the person to have to answer &quot;how&#x27;s it going&quot; as they pack up their desk. I disagree with the long heart-to-heart conversation approach. After just getting canned is not the right time for mentoring. They’ll find support elsewhere, you trying to ease their pain makes it worse. If you like the person and would like to help them, tell them that, but tell them to catch up with you later on and say you’re happy to talk when they’re in a position to. If they want to talk right away, by all means do, but don’t force it on them.<p>I have never fired someone too soon. In retrospect, I always should have acted faster. The fact that you’re on here asking for advice means that it’s time to act.<p>Finally, I realize that some of the above may sound ruthless, so let me make three comments on philosophy and _why_ being direct and decisive is the best course of action:<p>1) It is demoralizing to the rest of the team to see someone reaping the same benefits they get for doing better work. One bad player will poison an entire team. Even nice, pleasant, hard-working people who require too much care and feeding will sap energy from the team.<p>2) It is not fair to the individual to leave them in a position where they are not succeeding. Leaving someone in a position where they are not cutting it is cruel – s/he will find a better fit elsewhere.<p>3) In a start-up environment, you simply cannot afford a B-player in any key role. Everyone has to put up at least their own weight, and a single person not doing that reduces your odds of success.  A lot has been written on this, so I won’t go on – but one wrong hire can destroy a small company.",1447784084

A neurotypical person&#x27;s brain could spontaneously generate a violent psychotic episode due to a stroke or adrenergic tumor or somesuch. Just like any area of the sky could spontaneously throw a lightning strike at you at any time. It&#x27;s low probability, certainly, but murder is a low-probability event to begin with.<p>I think if we eliminated all murders except these, we would be in excellent shape. My point is these are not the ones worth focusing on, because we don&#x27;t have good tools to deal with &quot;random, history free, psychotic break.&quot;<p>> The important point is that a model with &quot;non-deterministic&quot; people in it has more predictive power, epidemiologically, than a model where it&#x27;s impossible to become a murderer without &quot;warning signs.&quot;<p>Well, if your probabilistic model has no &quot;warning signs&quot;, then how does it provide any information at all? If you don&#x27;t have a method of using information to differentiate the probabilities when given a person/group of people/location etc. then you have no predictive power at all, except for the average murder per capita.<p>> building education toward methods of &quot;de-escalation&quot; for psychotic episodes, crimes of passion, etc.<p>De-escalation of psychotic episodes is an impossibly hard thing to teach without protracted work with a mental health professional. In addition, I seriously doubt that there would be any effectiveness when taught to people who have not experienced psychosis. Teaching this to everybody would be inhibited not only by cost, but by the fact that there is not likely enough people in a society that would be good enough therapists to do this on a large scale.",1447784025

He stated very matter of fact it is to try and collect as much as possible of the total due.  He didn&#x27;t say what that amount would be though.<p>I guess I am somewhat conflicted because I don&#x27;t necessarily see this practice as all bad, but it does seem to have the potential to cause a problem for the very people that are most at risk to having an overdraft charge.

You might say &quot;well OK, so get rid of religion&quot;. People will still seek power, but in other ways. In other words, there are people who always seek the easiest way to gain more power and influence.<p>Yes, the Quran was revealed directly to Muhammad. He told his wife first, and she believed him. It just spread from there. I&#x27;d argue that the absolutely miracolous rate at which Islam spread throughout the region is a plus in favor of Islam :)<p>As for your point about eternal torture, let&#x27;s say a guy comes up to you in the street nowadays and tells you he&#x27;s a Prophet sent by God to save humanity. He tells you about this book called Mojimbi which is the word of God. At this point, you have complete freedom to accept of reject his claim. Unless he can convince you that what he&#x27;s saying is true, you wouldn&#x27;t believe him and he&#x27;d be on his way.<p>Muhammad however was able to convince people with two things.<p>One, he was known in his community to be an extremely honest person; never once did anyone hear of him lying. He was a trader, so he dealt with a lot of people. So when he said that he was visited by an angel etc, some people just believed him on the spot. Of course, many others called him crazy, so it wasn&#x27;t a fool-proof plan.<p>Two, he had the Quran. Some background first. The community Muhammad lived in was very well-versed in the Arabic language. Most mastered the language and its intricacies by the age of 10, and were known as experts in poetry. Look it up, Arabic is extremely complex.<p>So he recites some verses from the Quran to people and claims that these are words from Allah (keep in mind he was illiterate). They were amazed, absolutely awestruck by the words coming out of his mouth. The structure and linguistic nature of the verses was perfect, and this was coming from experts in the language! One of the Prophet&#x27;s biggest critics (and a great poet no less) at the time was almost going to join Islam just because of this.<p>Now, let&#x27;s go back to the example. You&#x27;re a professor of English language at Standford, and a guy you&#x27;ve dealt with a lot and who you know is an extremely honest person in all aspects tells you the same message. He also recites some verses that are so elegant and beautiful in structure that they make Shakespeare look like a pre-schooler&#x27;s work, and tells you these are the words of God.

The hidden microphones were activated at least 31 times through September 2010, according to the filing.\n>\n> The only authorization came from attorneys working for the FBI and Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice, the motion states.<p>In one sense, this is a small thing. There isn&#x27;t any allegation that the recordings caught privileged attorney-client communication or jury deliberations. But it <i>is</i> an attack on the integrity of the legal system, and it&#x27;s part of a pattern of attacks on the legal system that adds up to a serious threat to the rule of law.<p>Defendants are asking for these recordings to be quashed.

We already have sound engineers and special effects engineers and financial engineers, and I don&#x27;t think anyone is confused about the difference between a structural engineer and a software engineer, so this controversy seems a little bit contrived.  Also, while reading half a book on PHP and MySql and calling yourself an &quot;engineer&quot; is a bit of an eye roller, I don&#x27;t think that calling people who design large scalable systems that need to provide highly accurate and timely results in high stakes systems an &quot;engineer&quot; is that bad an appropriation of the term &quot;engineer&quot;.  Keep in mind, this term had meaning long before the PE bodies showed up.  According to the wikipedia page, &quot;engineer&quot; is devised from the latin words for &quot;to contrive, devise&quot; and &quot;cleverness&quot;, so in many ways, you could say a clever bit of programming is closer to the spirit of &quot;engineering&quot; than conservatively applying tried and true formulas to make sure a bridge or building doesn&#x27;t fall down.<p>I avoid the term &quot;software engineer&quot; because I don&#x27;t want organizations like the &quot;National Council of Examiners for Engineering and Surveying&quot; to start thinking they have a right to regulate who gets to write software.    I also think programmer is a great word. I feel like there&#x27;s a kind of insecurity in calling ourselves something other than programmers.  Yes, programmers do more than just write code, we consult, understand business requirements, start businesses, interact with users, take early adopters through betas, refine, adapt, prototype, teach, write technical articles.  I just don&#x27;t see why we need to keep adding a new word.<p>I don&#x27;t really mind &quot;Developer&quot; either, but I&#x27;d say let&#x27;s stop the word churn and instead make our title something to be proud of, rather than trying to appropriate another word.  When people ask me what I do, I just tell them I&#x27;m a programmer.<p>In spite of all this, I&#x27;m not really against some kind of exam, but I really don&#x27;t like the idea that it will be locked down to people who have paid $45,000 a year for three possibly unnecessary years of graduate school, under pain of imprisonment, like law.  It&#x27;s really awesome that people who studied math, or physics, or philosophy, or didn&#x27;t go to college at all can contribute at the very highest level, and in fact many of the most brilliant contributions have come from people who didn&#x27;t study CS.  Many brilliant contributions come from people who did study CS.  But we really don&#x27;t want to lock down Software &quot;Engineering&quot; this way, and scope creep is a serious danger.  In short, I could see it being a good thing, but I could also see it going wrong in a very harmful way.",1447783248

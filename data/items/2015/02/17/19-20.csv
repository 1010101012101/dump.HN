9064576,comment,9062758,9064020,0,0,ellyagg,,,"Who cares how many times a question comes up? That is just such a non-issue, a peeve of a minority of replaceable people, because people are always replaceable, including the ranks of those who answer the most questions. Resurfacing questions is helpful for people new to programming topics and who are just discovering the lay of the land by using the New filter on StackOverflow. Novelty for advanced users should be an incredibly low priority, yet because advanced users have power, it becomes a big priority. The fact is, if some advanced users get bored by the stream of novice questions and leave, that&#x27;s fine, there will always be new experts to take their place: SO is extremely popular that way.<p>What really frustrates me is that the usual interface to SO is Google, yet SO closes so many questions as duplicates that this interface is massively under-optimized. It would be much easier to find the solutions to problems if there were variations in Google&#x27;s index for every different way a question&#x27;s been asked (and answered).<p>And answering questions is a great way for intermediate developers to concretize their own knowledge. There&#x27;s always a new wave of developers needing to learn. Why on earth SO fetishizes itself now as a DRY repository of programming questions is beyond me. Ok, it&#x27;s not actually beyond me, it&#x27;s because SO is made up of programmers, and programmers tend be compulsive about DRYing up everything in sight even when that&#x27;s not the best solution to the problem.<p>The complaints of SO&#x27;s elites are the same I&#x27;ve seen since always on mailing lists and forums by the folks who have the most power and thus force their ideals on everyone else. It repels novice users and creates a hostile environment for mentoring and learning. What&#x27;s sad is that when SO first came out, it was set apart from these incumbents for being welcome, open, and friendly.<p>Another side issue is that the SO culture almost certainly is not receptive to female developers. I thought of this the other day when I saw some woman&#x27;s post in the negatives. The sort of chest-thumping, rule-brandishing nitpickery that&#x27;s the order of the day is an intimidating turn-off for a large swathe of people.<p>What&#x27;s happened to SO is why every institution has to be replaced eventually, as SO will be, by some question and answer site that returns to SO&#x27;s roots. The world is crying out for it again the same way it was when SO was founded.",1424203169

It&#x27;s making the internet better. It&#x27;s also always been clear that there was a tension between questions that are interesting to experts and questions that are so basic that only an absolute beginner will ask them.

I hope that the implementation can prove as a reference in improving httprouter or other Golang muxers.<p>I like httprouter, but dislike how the dependency on httprouter.Params pollutes your packages that need to expose httprouter.Handle.<p>I also dislike the non-standard handler, even with map[string]string parameters. From what I read the proper way to &quot;scope&quot; things in Go is to pass &quot;it&quot; as a parameter to a method; so the dislike is just personal preference. Currently the only way to retain the standard (http.Handler) interface compatibility is to use a synchronized reference map e.g. map[*http.Request]map[string]string, similar to Gorilla Contexts&#x27; implementation with only the parameters associated with the request.<p>Anyway, after all those changes it was a short jump to implement basic middleware helpers and expose an initializer with a standard implementation to associate the parameters with the request.<p>I hope that answered your questions and thanks for showing interest :) P.S.

9064442,comment,9061901,9062370,0,0,fredkbloggs,,,"There are standards, many of them, just as there are many different standards for AC power worldwide.  Your DC system design will be governed by practical technical considerations in concert with economics.  The physics of low-voltage systems are such that they are viable only when current is low; otherwise, a 5V or even 12V system will require prohibitively expensive heavy-gauge wire in order to provide the proper voltage at the point of use.  So modern DC systems are typically all 48V or even higher now (people are building solar systems with system voltages of 600VDC!).  That does not mean you need to run those higher voltages within your home, but from a practical perspective you probably want either 24V or 48V unless your house and/or current needs are very small.  To figure this out, you need to consider the following:<p>- What devices do you need to supply?  Often this is the true governing factor although switching regulators are very efficient and inexpensive up to a few amps.\n- How much current do you need to supply to a particular location (this depends on the power consumption of what you&#x27;re running)?\n- What is the distance from the panel to the point of use?  The longer the distance, the greater the voltage drop across a wire of a given size (and the higher the cost of larger wire).<p>As for connectors, there are only a couple of sensible answers.  USB is fine for 5V/1A needs, but you&#x27;re not going to want to run a bunch of 5V wiring separately from the higher-voltage wiring you&#x27;re going to need anyway.  The proper approach here is something like <a href=""http://www.powerwerx.com/adapter-cables/usbbuddy-powerpole-12v-usb-5v-device-charger.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.powerwerx.com/adapter-cables/usbbuddy-powerpole-1...</a>, which will happily work in either a 12V or 24V nominal system.  You can of course make other power supplies from all-in-one ICs like <a href=""http://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/RECOM-Power/R-78W90-05/?qs=sGAEpiMZZMsc0tfZmXiUnUkNRh%2feR2rThZf2%252bPpU02Tot4ByAEAirQ%3d%3d"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/RECOM-Power/R-78W90-05/?...</a> and a small project box; larger currents and other voltages are available too, of course.  These make good replacements for wall warts.<p>But you don&#x27;t want to be wiring any of that in your house; instead, you want to use Anderson Powerpoles in a single-voltage (probably 24V or 48V) system.  They are properly rated for DC use at these voltages and plenty of current (up to 350A if you need it, which you won&#x27;t).  They can be installed in blocks of 4 2-blade connectors in standard wall boxes, with neat, professional plates.  They can be easily crimped onto appropriate-gauge wire by amateurs.  They are code-compatible and safe, unlike the dangerous practice of using receptacles designed for 120VAC or some other existing local/regional standard.  They provide a reliable connection and reliable disconnection, and if crimped properly they will not fray, crack, or loosen within a very large number of connect/disconnect cycles.  The other low-voltage DC &quot;standard&quot; that is popular, the barrel-type &quot;cigarette lighter&quot; connector, provides only 7A at 12V, is bulky, and does not offer a reliable connection.  While it is popular in automotive applications, more serious users of DC power -- the Powerpole is very popular among amateur radio enthusiasts -- avoid the barrel type connectors for these reasons.<p>The only real decision to make is whether to use 24V or 48V, which will depend primarily on the questions I noted above.  Higher voltages are certainly possible, but watch out!  Switches rated for higher DC voltages (especially at currents much more than 1 or 2A) are hard to find and expensive.  Your standard &quot;AC quiet switch&quot; that you can buy for $2 at the local hardware store is rated for 125V AC ONLY.  It is not safe to use with any DC system, although in practice it&#x27;s probably acceptable for 12V systems at a hundred milliamps or so.  For more practical applications, you will need to be sure that your equipment is equipped with proper switches, or no switches at all; you will also need to make sure that any hard-wired DC circuits (such as for lighting) are properly switched.  Where you have flexibility in the voltage accepted by your equipment, you will need to trade off the higher cost of switches and other passive components at higher voltages against the higher cost (or voltage drop) associated with wiring at lower voltages.  You will quickly learn to read spec sheets and rating stamps carefully when you work with DC.<p>The last thing I&#x27;ll mention is that you may not really want to do this.  At my location, there are often several months with extremely limited power; even the inverter&#x27;s 25W base consumption dictates that it be on an hour a day or less if at all possible.  For that reason, anything I have that needs smallish amounts of power continuously (such as a freezer, reading lamp, phone charger, etc.) gets DC.  But in general, it&#x27;s simply more convenient to use off-the-shelf devices.  I can and do make my own power supplies, but I don&#x27;t really want to go re-power my laser printer or table saw (which by the way has an AC-only induction motor in it).  For higher-power devices, off-the-shelf is the way to go; it&#x27;s much cheaper and the inverter&#x27;s overhead is amortized over a lot of consumption anyway.  If you have a larger system that can easily supply 100W or more on an indefinite basis, you probably don&#x27;t need to bother much with DC; it&#x27;ll be easier to just leave the inverter running all the time.  A DC-powered well pump or freezer might be worthwhile, but I wouldn&#x27;t go converting anything else.  Most people are putting in enormous (to me) solar systems now; 10kW is common.  With a system that large, you&#x27;ll probably be fine even if it&#x27;s overcast.  For reference, I have 700 watts, and with endless stretches of 6-hour overcast days in winter, DC is the only way to fly.  But your needs are likely to be very different indeed, especially if you have (as we&#x27;re discussing here) adequate storage.  The days of custom-wired 12VDC off-grid living are basically over unless your budget is extremely limited.",1424201657

See <a href=""http://refillables.grrn.org/content/americas-experience-refillable-beverage-containers"" rel=""nofollow"">http://refillables.grrn.org/content/americas-experience-refi...</a> :<p>> As soon as packaged beer became popular in the mid-1930s, cans competed with refillable glass bottles for the market. The figure and table show how the rise of metal cans and a fluctuating but significant demand for one-way bottles concurred with the decline of refillable bottles. One-way containers helped national beer companies conquer the U.S. market, and their conquest further diminished the use of refillable glass bottles.<p>Marketing national brands also became easier with the rise of popularity of radio and TV in the 1950s. <a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/how-budweiser-became-the-king-of-beers-an-evolution-of-advertising-2012-3?op=1&IR=T"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businessinsider.com/how-budweiser-became-the-king...</a> comments:<p>> Budweiser had its glory days in the 1950s when Anheuser-Busch helped strengthen its national brand by sponsoring shows featuring Jackie Gleason, Milton Berle, and Frank Sinatra. It also promoted its beer by sponsoring sporting events and branding stadiums. By the 1980s, Budweiser was synonymous with American culture.<p>Here&#x27;s an essay about the decline of regional breweries in Cincinnati - <a href=""http://www.wcpo.com/entertainment/local-a-e/cincinnatis-rise-and-fall-as-a-brewery-town-part-2great-experiment-ends-breweries-make-a-comeback"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wcpo.com/entertainment/local-a-e/cincinnatis-rise...</a> .

When the post-9/11 wars started, I thought one of the highest priorities would be to get combat units to a point where they didn&#x27;t need external interpreters for the regions they were going to be operating in. An interpreter is a massively dangerous potential point of failure -- he could be incompetent, as the article suggests, or worse, he could be actively conspiring with the enemy to tip them off about your movements, feed you misleading info and make you look bad to the locals. If you can&#x27;t speak at least the rudiments of the language yourself, you have no way of knowing. But after a decade of war in Iraq and Afghanistan, American combat units appear to be just as dependent on external interpreters as they were going in.<p>I suspect part of the reason for this that the article doesn&#x27;t touch on is the idea of the rotation.

Throwaway games are fine for $10 or less, you know?<p>THE AGE WHEN Activision, EA and Ubisoft aren&#x27;t the only options anymore, and they have to change their ways to stay relevant.<p>THE AGE WHEN the content that would have just been cut from the game to make the release sane is at least available for a price.<p>THE AGE WHEN niche categories like roguelikes and adventure games are exploding because it&#x27;s finally profitable to release (or remaster) them.<p>THE AGE WHEN you can buy nearly any notable game made in the last 25 years for a reasonable price and run it on modern hardware.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong--there are things wrong with gaming right now, especially speaking as a quality professional.<p>The &quot;release now, patch later&quot; issue on console has been there (ignoring the &quot;PC master race&quot; for a moment) ever since Microsoft relaxed the rules on Xbox, but it wasn&#x27;t a new thing. Those of us who bought Daggerfall and Battlecruiser 3000 AD have been well and familiar with it for many, many years. Talk to the folks who uninstalled Myth 2 and lost their hard drives to it.<p>Even on console, game-crippling bugs or flaws like the slowdown in Final Fantasy Tactics or any number of &quot;corrupt save&quot; bugs were just unpatchable, and you got stuck with a broken game with no hope.<p>And Metacritic, valuable as it is, has caused a race to the middle--for games on Metacritic. So the blockbusters are boring now.<p>But if anything, that&#x27;s made room for people to come from below. Minecraft would have been awfully hard to pull off in that middle period where indie games hadn&#x27;t hit and blockbusters still sucked. Companies like Stardock, ID, and Apogee were a rarity, and invariably as soon as they came along they either started repeating the same sins (looking at you, GalCiv2) or got bought by Activision, Microsoft, whoever to become just one of the crowd.<p>There&#x27;s just a ton of rosy nostalgia going on here. This is the best time for gaming since probably the early 90s, when console, PC, and arcade were all viable and in-play; blockbusters were just starting; and games sold on fun factor, not strictly on marketing, with no expectation of making millions of dollars to cover movie-like production costs.<p>People aren&#x27;t seeing the opportunity that&#x27;s come with the hassle.",1424200829

A statistical test attempts to examine a stream of bits and determine if they &quot;look random&quot; from a narrow, naive point of view, often predefined ahead of time.<p>On the other hand, a cryptographic adversary actively seeks to break the RNG, which may include tricks that statistical tests simply do not account for. As an example, the Mersenne Twister passes many statistical tests, but after observing 630 or so outputs, an intelligent adversary (with some math) can predict all future outputs of the RNG. That is not something a simple test can uncover.<p>So, essentially, if your RNG fails statistical tests, it is totally unworthy of any consideration at all from a cryptographic standpoint. If it passes all the selected statistical tests, good for it---all that means is that it might not be totally broken.<p>That isn&#x27;t to say that statistical tests are without value. If they were in the build checking process, they could spot when the RNG has failed catastrophically, sometimes. They could not spot when cryptographic problems arise, though.",1424200752

The technical corrections and constant closing of questions by mods discouraged my asking of questions ages ago. There is a feeling that researching the details necessary to describe the question adequately takes away from research that may have yielded how to solve it by looking at similar questions or documentation. I know that this is partly the intention of the mods: go do your homework before asking. But, it can swing to be the flipside: homework of asking is as long or longer than deciphering your problem. In my experience, much of a questioners research to prepare their question was UNRELATED to their problem, so the amount of information included in the question is far above and beyond what is necessary to solve their variable typo, or whatever.<p>Where this is a good thing for the long-term usefulness of SO, like the OP said it takes away from the short-term usefulness of the site for us plebian self-doubters.<p>Having said that, previously asked questions on SO answer ~90% of my programming questions, so they&#x27;re obviously doing something right.<p>I&#x27;ve thought before that a &#x27;staging area&#x27; for questions might be useful, where a question gets posted by _anon_idiot_user_ like me asking why thier code won&#x27;t run because of something simple. It is marked as &#x27;not useful&#x27; for whatever reason, but can still offer (diminished) reputation to answerers. After a particular amount of time, the question is removed from the SO &#x27;canon&#x27; (i.e. unpublished and deleted), but the reputation sticks. Nobody&#x27;s ego is hurt from having thier stupid question memorialized, and mods would be more forgiving to stupid questioners knowing it will go away once solved.<p>just an idea.

Still it only adds to the problems with this area of the law, after all it is not only possible, but common, for an individual to be classified as an employee/independent contractor on the federal level and then classified the opposite at the state level.<p>Nevertheless, while the federal classification 20 factors have been around for about 30 years, since the enactment of the Revenue Act the IRS has been prohibited from issuing regulations and rulings with respect to the employment status of any individuals.  As a result the IRS acknowledges the same subjectivity going so far as to admit different IRS agents may reach different conclusions, the Courts are no different and hence my calling factors tests the worst kind of law.<p>>As far as I understand the rules, the &quot;most heavily weighted factor&quot; you cite is in fact not an IRS employee classification factor at all.  A contractor can still be classified as an employee...<p>This is likely due to the IRS being prohibited from issuing rules and regulations, and as a result in the words of the IRS, &quot;Previously issued guidance may not\nreflect current case law, statutory changes, or changes in workplace situations.&quot; However, you are correct that this factor, under FL case law, though weighted more heavily is not determinative by any means.",1424199802

While it is theoretically possible that we could conclusively find BB(X) for any X, we don&#x27;t know, nor can we prove, that we can (aside from the ones that have already been proven).  Therefore I don&#x27;t know that it makes sense to talk about it being a specific number, but rather the concept of a number (more like his &quot;number of grains of sand in the Sahara&quot; example, which he explicitly mentioned is not valid^.)<p>^Although his reasoning is that it is not valid because it is always changing, not specifically because it is unknown.  Still, I assume that &quot;Number of grains of sand in the Sahara at exactly midnight, Jan. 1 2050, on this atomic clock&quot; would also be disallowed, even though it&#x27;s possible we would somehow be able to know exactly what that number is in the future.",1424199769

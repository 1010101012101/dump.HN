9664649,comment,9659293,9659293,0,0,pluma,,,"Pedantic tangent: saying Germany has &quot;abandoned&quot; tuition fees is not entirely correct.<p>Until a few years ago there were no tuition fees in public universities in Germany. In fact there still aren&#x27;t any non-public universities, though there are private academies.<p>University education is also not as common in Germany as it is in the US: although more jobs require formal education and certification in Germany (e.g. if you professionally paint cars in Germany, you need a specific formal qualification to do so), there are long-standing trade-specific education systems that provide these, rather than universities. These are typically three to five year trainings consisting of an internship as well as formal schooling. Historically university has been more academic in nature, being considered to be more about higher education than a job qualification for the industry. In other words, someone with a university degree effectively has no job experience but may understand the higher-level concepts of the business domain (i.e. the &quot;why&quot;) whereas someone with a non-university trade education has less high-level knowledge but a lot of hands-on experience (i.e. the &quot;how&quot;).<p>Public universities only charge a comparatively low fee (typically around EUR 200-400), which mostly covers services provided by the university&#x27;s student union who also often negotiate deals like public transit tickets (which are then paid from the student union&#x27;s cut). The student unions are thus able to adjust the fee to provide additional services but generally puts decisions which would result in higher fees up to a direct vote by all enrolled students. The decision-making council is also directly elected by the students (which has resulted in a political microcosm that is quite similar to the government-level political parties).<p>A few years ago, Germany officially adopted the Bachelor/Master system because various European nations decided to standardize higher education degrees across Europe. The general argument for doing so was that it made degrees from different countries more comparable and thus reduced the HR headaches for internationally hiring companies.<p>Shortly after the BA/MA switch, Germany changed a law that previously prohibited tuition fees in public universities so it only specified a cap of EUR 500 per semester (on top of the existing baseline fee). This was officially part of an initiative to raise the quality of education, along with funding for universities that were trying to create &quot;elite&quot; faculties (i.e. specialising). Officially this would not result in reducing the government spending on universities but it was an open secret that the cap would be raised over the next years as tuition fees gain more acceptance and thus allow the government to slowly pull out their funding to make universities more independent. Officially it was also predicted that most universities wouldn&#x27;t set their tuition fees to the legal maximum.<p>Predictably, the vast majority of universities introduced tuition fees at exactly the legal maximum (EUR 500 on top of the existing fees). While EUR 700-800 is still &quot;low&quot; by American standards, it effectively meant an up to 3x increase many students couldn&#x27;t easily afford. To add insult to injury, the universities&#x27; invoices would often contain ads by state banks offering student loans at &quot;reasonable&quot; terms (i.e. lower-than-average interest and they&#x27;d pay the tuition fee for you so you continue to only have to pay the baseline fee yourself, giving you the illusion that nothing has changed until you graduate or drop out and suddenly have accrued quite a bit of debt).<p>It should also be noted that culturally, Germany is a nation of savers, not loaners. While most students were previously able to graduate with no debt at all (except for a public grant known as BAFÃ¶G which covers up to 100% of the baseline fee with only the difference accumulating as debt) the tuition fees threatened to change that entirely.<p>Also predictably, the students reacted quite vocally. There were lots of protests all over Germany and the way most universities handled was a bit upsetting because it violated the silent historical agreement (established by precedent after the famous 1968 student protests) that university disputes are handled non-violently by the university and its students, not by riot police.<p>After spending a few months explaining to students that tuition was here to stay and that EUR 500 per semester is entirely negligible (to quote the head of the University of Cologne: &quot;just drink one less beer a day&quot; -- I should probably add that binge drinking frat parties are less of a thing in Germany), some universities finally dropped the tuition fees, resulting in a slow cascade as the growth of applicant numbers shrank for those universities that still maintained non-zero tuition fees.<p>Nowadays, I don&#x27;t think any university still charges tuition fees. I&#x27;m not sure whether the government intervened at some point and repealed the act that allowed them in the first place or whether it was entirely &quot;voluntary&quot; but they&#x27;re effectively gone now.<p>It&#x27;s important to recognize that the outrage was less about the specific sum -- while a 2x-3x increase in cost can be world-changing for low-income students, it&#x27;s still manageable, especially if you can stomach taking a loan (or are poor enough you don&#x27;t have to pay the fees at all). The more important thing was that it created a slippery slope. The only reason the tuition fee was that low was that it was the legal maximum. Adjusting that maximum would have been politically much easier than passing the act that allowed the fees in the first place, especially if the increase is gradual.<p>A change from zero to a low value is much more intrusive than a change from a non-zero value to a higher value. Introducing tuition fees set a precedent that created a potential path to US-level costs while also turning student debt from an exception to the norm. The UK is a good parallel (tuition fees were introduced in 1998 with a legal maximum that has been increased several times since).<p>Yes, dear Americans, the US is considered the negative example by German students -- although German politics and industry of course fawn over the quality of elite universities in the US (while ignoring that the quality of German universities compares favourably with non-elite universities in the US).",1433497461

The wording does also seem to imply that it is looking at reported cases as opposed to use a survey, which would give different numbers.<p>In terms of type of abuse you consider, it will drastically shift the balance. E.g. for sexual abuse the numbers are completely dominated by male family members. Once you add in violence it shifts a lot, and other neglect will likely shift it further if for no other reason than simply because women are still more likely to be the primary carer.<p>Of course in any case it doesn&#x27;t alter the main point.",1433497377

But this assumption requires that their database cluster is always connected, within some heartbeat interval (which they mention) such that they can trust there exists a maximum bounded Îµ skew.<p>So while it seems like a dumb question, I honestly must ask a very trivial question: how does CockroachDB handle basic network partitions? I assume they have a good answer to this, but it needs to be clarified in order to answer the more important issue of anomalous partitions, like split brain.

The rules don&#x27;t work as you would expect: eg messages from &quot;a@b.com&quot; do not match &quot;sender ends with&quot; &quot;b.com&quot;.  Rules can only filter on one thing at a time -- no compound rules on eg sender and subject.

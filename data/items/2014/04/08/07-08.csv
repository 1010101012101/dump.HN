This means no more security updates, patches, or technical support for the popular OS, which is still running on 30% of all computers. It&#x27;s very interesting to see how it affect the XP user who are using it, after the end of XP support era.

7552031,comment,7551276,7551671,0,0,waps,,,"> The way the Quran uses language is very intricate.<p>That&#x27;s what muslims claim. Actually reading the thing does not <i>at all</i> give that impression. It truly is a massive effort, reading it. I admire anyone who&#x27;s gotten through it because it&#x27;s so incredibly obtuse and confusing (yes I know about the chapter and sentence ordering, what moron came up with that ?). Except of course, if you assume any word you don&#x27;t immediately recognize is greek it becomes a lot easier. Of course then you start saying &quot;wait ... this translation is wrong&quot;. Try it.<p>When it comes to recitation, this is actually a tradition of the ancient world, and all texts from those eras were written like that, always. You can recite rhythmically pretty much any ancient text (meaning from the ancient era : 1000 BC to 500 AD or so, and then the renaissance texts of course). You should listen to a few Roman recitations :<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGH8QKeHnpQ"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGH8QKeHnpQ</a><p>In other words, I see your recitation as further proof that the quran is just a text that fits perfectly within it&#x27;s timeframe, which is of course a very strong argument against that it is anything special. The bible is more interesting, as it has pieces from different eras that follow different styles, but when God speaks (not often, grant you) there is never any local style applied. Stories are styled, including in verses to enable recitation.<p>As for the language of the Quran, have you ever googled &quot;Christopher Luxenberg&quot; ?<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Syro-Aramaic_Reading_of_the_Koran"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Syro-Aramaic_Reading_of_the...</a><p>Here&#x27;s his central argument : rewrite the quran in arameic(/greek), letter-by-letter and <i>it makes sense</i>, both in a historical context, the grammar is suddenly correct (no longer &quot;intricate&quot;), and it is obviously based on the New Testament. Whereas in arabic it cannot be read by itself, it just does not make sense. As you say &quot;The way the Quran uses language is very intricate&quot;. It&#x27;s not intricate, however, it&#x27;s <i>wrong</i>.<p>Oh and there is even an Arameic word for &quot;Songbook&quot; (meaning an extract of the New Testament, with most text put into verses to be sung, as you can find today in every church on the planet). Know what that word is ? &quot;Koran&quot; ... This word is at least 300 years older than islam ... Coincidence ? Not really.<p>Keep in mind that Arabic is not in fact that far removed from Greek, because it is based on Hebrew, a late dialect of Hebrew was heavily influenced by Greek. It is like Doric text. Doric text will sort-of make sense to an English reader, he will probably think it&#x27;s ancient English. But of course it&#x27;s not. But only an Doric speaker will know that. The same is true for the quran. It is incredibly obtuse language in arabic, but it&#x27;s perfectly clear and normal language in Arameic.<p>Example:<p><pre><code>  GIN I was God, sitting up there abeen,\n  Weariet nae doot noo an my darg was deen,\n  Deaved wih the harps an hymns oonending ringing,\n  Tired of the flocking angels hairse wih singing,\n</code></pre>\n(famous poem)<p>Looks like English, doesn&#x27;t it ? Looks &quot;intricate&quot;, perhaps ? But you see wrong grammar (e.g. the form of &quot;to be&quot; in &quot;weariet nae doot noo&quot; (it translates to &#x27;there was no doubt&#x27;)), you see recognizable, but misspelled words. But they&#x27;re not wrong. It&#x27;s simply a different language.",1396943857

My ambitions ran ahead of my capabilities. Being fascinated by operating systems (I vividly remember tinkering with OS/2, Windows 95 Beta, DesqView/X, Linux 1.1.18) I wanted to write one on my own. The main aim was to have that magical thing called multitasking. I wrote a &quot;kernel&quot; in QBasic. Upon starting a new &quot;process&quot; it would:<p>- read in the text file of the new process, which was a specially programmed QBasic program that included predefined hooks to facilitate preemptive multitasking and that was capable of saving and loading its state (i.e. values of all variables).<p>- merge this text file with the text files of all other running processes, including the &quot;kernel&quot;, and saving the new &quot;system image&quot; to disk.<p>- call the &quot;save state&quot; of all running processes<p>- exit from QBasic by running a batch file that would restart QBasic with the new system image, which would initiate by calling the &quot;load state&quot; of all processes.<p>It kind of worked :-) Such a pity I lost that code...",1396943540

Everybody keeps forgetting to point the finger at the real culprit: the Mozilla board.<p>There is certainly enough blame to go around elsewhere, like rabid reactions from all sides, the original unethical deed (contrary to the common simplifications it&#x27;s not about his beliefs per se, it&#x27;s about the act of enabling legislation that denies basic rights to a minority).<p>None of these casually-identified factors are really at fault for what happened. Let&#x27;s shift criticism to where it belongs: the Mozilla board elected someone into the chief public messaging position who seems to be prone to behavior that is fundamentally at odds with Mozilla&#x27;s core message. In doing so they provoked a very foreseeable public outcry and a series of highly emotional responses which ultimately ended up taking down an excellent technologist and by all accounts likeable fellow human.<p>Everybody has flaws, sometimes they&#x27;re even crippling flaws.

In Windows, when you want to edit your environment variables, there&#x27;s a simple configuration utility with a list of them, you click and edit and it all takes effect immediately.

And once you puzzle out the chain of command and edit everything you have to log out and back in. And when you want to make changes to the global environment, there&#x27;s /etc/environment, /etc/profile and /etc/profile.d/yourscripthere.sh.

Check it out. Like most Python PEPs it is quite readable. There are even alternative proposals and links to where the discussion of this issue has occurred.<p>It seems that the most fundamental reason is that matrix and memberwise multiplication are two distinct operations which use the same datatypes as operands and both have a very good claim to use of the * operator.<p>Also, just because a language is general purpose does not mean that it cannot support features which might be restricted in their use.<p>Two of the python&#x27;s most popular uses are in scientific and numeric fields (see SciPy, NumPy and ipython). This operator seems like it would be very useful for improving readability  in those areas which is probably reason enough to use it.<p>However, please resist the urge to just overload this new operator for something unrelated that you want. The point of infix operators is to improve the readability of code and lessen the cognitive load on the reader.

7551914,comment,7544301,7546124,1,0,anon4,,,"Eastern Europe, Bulgaria in particular. I&#x27;ve always attributed it to lax copyright laws (or at least lax application of said laws) and low average income, but not so low that you can&#x27;t afford to buy a PC and pay it off over a few months, resulting in rampant file sharing driving high demand for fast, unmetered internet access. For a while in the early 00s each ISP ran their own file sharing site even.<p>It also helps that you can just string cables between buildings tying them to lampposts and trees. &quot;Can&quot; meaning that it&#x27;s against all regulations and kind of unsafe in a thunderstorm (one friend had his NIC fried once, fun times), but people don&#x27;t complain - you can either have internet that you have to unplug when it rains or no internet at all because running cables and obeying the building code gets too pricey for lean ISP startups.<p>Today of course most cables are underground and smaller ISPs have merged or were bought by larger telecommunications operators. Also if you want internet access on your mobile phone, be prepared to get robbed in plain sight - GSM operators here operate just like everywhere else.<p>In the end, the actual pushing of bits around doesn&#x27;t really cost anything. Just some small amount of electricity. The actual costs to an ISP are all infrastructure and maintenance of the infrastructure. It&#x27;s not hard to get some money to buy routers and enough bandwidth to service a neighbourhood, then work your ass off as a sysadmin keeping everything running. The hard part is the cables. You have to run your own Ethernet and optics and anything that gets in the way of you running it drives cost up and makes it ever so harder to get into business.<p>In conclusion, lax building code laws and high consumer demand allowed our ISPs to start out with a minimal investment and upgrade their infrastructure as they went along to make it more and more reliable and safe. Today I&#x27;d say the price for access is as low as it can go, the service is pretty solid, with 8-10megabit speeds at the lowest and everybody gets given a static non-NAT IPv4 address for something like 15$/month.",1396942138

This imagined beauty to them because of the legends attached to them.<p>Oh and that &quot;not-tuned&quot; &quot;older-strings&quot; stuff was there to imply that an old violin, is an OLD violin.

So then the question becomes, &quot;Can I get away with centralization here?&quot; You look at the performance and failover characteristics required, and see if centralization will work for you over the next N years, and see what your plan (and timeline) for scaling out when your central box isn&#x27;t enough would look like.

Google owns all of the servers that make up GoogleFS; a cloud provider owns all of the Hadoop nodes in its datacenters; a PaaS provider owns all of its NoSQL datastore nodes; etc.  We see a similar pattern at work in Puppet, Chef, Ansible, Func, certmanager, etc. as well.<p>Under these circumstances, it&#x27;s desirable to maintain the authoritative state in a logically centralized place for two reasons.  First, doing so makes it easy for the rest of the system to discover and query it.  Second, it makes it easier to keep authoritative state consistent with updates.  Centralizing control and distributing data lets you address control-plane concerns separately and independently of data-plane concerns.<p>However, it stops making sense to centralize the authoritative state (control) once you build a system that spans multiple administrative domains.  Which domain gets to host the authoritative state?  How do you get the other domains to act on it?  Centralization won&#x27;t work here, unless you can first get the domains to agree on who&#x27;s the controller (sacrificing their autonomy to decide the state of the system).<p>We have addressed these concerns instead by distributing responsibility for the authoritative state across domains, and devising a way for them to reach consensus on it.  DNS does this by delegating authority for name bindings hierarchically.  The Internet maintains routing state by having each AS learn and advertise routes to each other AS via BGP.  Bitcoin maintains the blockchain (its authoritative state) by having a majority of nodes agree on the sequence of blocks added to it.  DHTs work by sharding the key space AND routing state across their participants.<p>It&#x27;s hard to achieve consensus (and react to changes) in these multi-domain settings versus the single-domain setting since you can&#x27;t force every domain&#x27;s replicas to agree.  However, this is a <i>feature</i>--no one but the computer&#x27;s owner should have the final say on the state it hosts.  Naturally, multi-domain systems must account for this in their design--something that Google&#x27;s internal systems can safely ignore.",1396941096

Right now you don&#x27;t know your base &#x27;conversion&#x27; stats so you don&#x27;t know how many nos give you a yes.  Of course you feel lost but you don&#x27;t have a base case to compare to.  Until you do, you need to keep plugging away and just keep track of your stats.<p>Say you find and you need 80 job applications to a job offer, well then that&#x27;s great because then you need to know how many nos you need to brush off to get to the yes.  Say you cut it down to 40 job applications to a job offer... well clearly you are getting better at the process.<p>I think playing these sorts of mind games with yourself is really helpful for keeping your ego intact and handling the rejection productively.",1396940499

In addition to rigidity and precision of the machine itself (bushing quality, rod runout), the speed, layer height, temperature, and filament regularity are all important to quality.  There are other software settings that impact quality as well.  Bed leveling in a machine that doesn&#x27;t have software auto-level is another big one.<p>If you know the stepper motor specs you can calculate the resolution.  Most motors are 1.8 degrees per step and most controllers use 16 micro steps.  If the GT2 pulley is 10 mm diameter, that gives 0.01 mm per micro-step.<p>If the machine is not rigid and precise then you won&#x27;t get full capability but 0.01 mm is very good and may be more than needed given the capabilities of the plastic, and the layering process.",1396940489

2734175,comment,2733694,2733942,10,0,ahi,,,"FPGAs and ASICs are in use by a few people/companies. They have the opposite cost structure of GPUs. The two main measures are MegaHash per $ and MegaHash per Watt, roughly analogous to fixed expenses and operating expenses though the MH/Watt also influences investment in power and cooling infrastructure. GPUs have a high MH/$, but a rather poor MH/W.<p>I own 2 Radeon 5830s, $110 each, that still spit out about $5 a day at current prices making for a rather impressive rate of return in spite of high power requirements. From what I have read, FPGAs require about an order of magnitude higher capital investment with the benefit of a drastically reduced power consumption. Last I checked about 6 weeks ago, a decent GPU rig could pay for itself in a month or two, while an FPGA setup could pay for itself in about a year. The tradeoff is that the GPU rig's payout may dip below power costs before it pays itself out (likely the case for any rigs purchased in the past month) essentially betting on the short term difficulty increases, while FPGAs are betting on the long term health of the bitcoin system itself.<p>FWIW, the newer ATI GPUs aren't as good for mining as the older 5800 series.<p>I was a PoliSci/CompSci/Econ mega-nerd in Uni, so Bitcoin is my fantasy come true.",1309964391

For most searches, Google is good enough and only a small number of our current users started using our website for search/discovery.<p>We ended up spending a significant amount of time decorating the ads within search results and after a considerable amount of logging and number crunching, found that decorating those ads not only increased the clickthrough rate of ads we decorated, but also increased the overall ad clickthrough rate.  That's a huge win for a search engine and worth a lot of money, but ultimately google just did it themselves, and for other search vendors that had ads on their pages, they were basically handcuffed to google's contract which wouldn't allow them to use our technology.<p>TL;DR - Competing with Google is hard.",1309963514

In my mind, I think your definition fits the ""technically poor,"" not the socially and economically marginalized.<p>The technically poor would be those with substantial assets like a paid-off condo or house, with a six-figure 401k, good credit and family with substantial means, who suddenly become unemployed and so meet the income criteria, if only temporarily.  Some of these people are low-skilled, and some are high-skilled.<p>For those folks, it certainly could be rational (if demoralizing) to stay on unemployment, because their real safety net is tapping into their assets at some point, e.g. when their benefits run out.<p>In my limited experience, the ""working poor"" are very demoralized by government assistance, accepting it as a last resort, and they tend to want to get back into a job for reasons of pride and ego.<p>The people who are morally corrupt and willing to exploit the system have absolutely nothing to do with poverty.

I founded Electric Cloud (<a href=""http://www.electric-cloud.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.electric-cloud.com/</a>) to solve this problem and we ended up needing to:<p>1. Completely understand the build process from the build script (e.g. Makefile)<p>2. Write a parallel distributed, versioned file system so that we could automatically spot the dependencies that were not mentioned in the build script.<p>Once we'd done that we were able to get very high parallelism from unmodified build scripts which was impossible with tools like make -j, distcc, etc.  The reason is that almost all build scripts assume serial builds and thus do things like reusing a temporary file name which breaks parallelism.  Or you have nightmares like a shared precompiled header file that everyone is updating.<p>Once you crank up the parallelism then you can start worrying about disk latency, network latency etc.  That led us to do everything in RAM on the worker nodes, our own binary protocol with compression, and peer-to-peer communication inside the worker node cluster to maximize switch utilization and minimize master load.",1309962685

People still talk about philosophers with ancient names, heavy with dignity even though their ideas have been challenged or extended since their time.<p>Really, nobody talking about truth should be failing to make a distinction between what is true and what is know since Godel did his work, but Descartes had the disadvantage of being born to early to know about that.  In particular, his justifications fall afoul of the third horn of the Mnchhausen Trilemma, by resorting to assuming some things as axiomatic.  In particular, on reflection I'm baffled that Laplace can take ""I think"" as axiomatic but not ""I am"".

2099492,comment,2098472,2098968,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Exactly. This is what google excels at. At most IT shops redundant SAN storage and massive server capacity is hugely expensive because there are such incredibly high maintenance and personnel costs associated with such things. Google solves the problem by automating the ever loving crap out of everything and using commodity hardware (rather than ""server-grade"" stuff). The result is dramatically lower costs for things like redundant, networked storage. Allowing google to do things like offer free multi-gigabyte email accounts to everyone in the world or like upgrading youtube from 10mb/10min videos at sub-analog TV quality to 1080p unlimited length videos in multiple codecs.<p>From Google's perspective making use of these massive storage capabilities is a plus for them. They are able to do it at much lower cost than just about anyone else, so when they find a business case where they can leverage their storage capabilities they are smart to do so because it can translate into a competitive advantage.

For example; it's late at night, your daughter or girlfriend hasn't returned home yet and their phone is off. You start to imagine the worst scenarios (accident, rape, cheating, whatever..) and your mind is stupid enough that it starts to believe them and making those scenarios real. You start to get worried, then anxious, then angry at them for not thinking of you and how worried you are. Maybe you are really angry when they get home and scream at them just to discover that they have been somewhere safe all night and just ran out of battery.<p>Being able to realize that those scenarios are just creations of your mind and snapping out of the obsessive loop of thoughts it's one of the most important things you can learn in life.",1294917762

Though we noticed in tomcat documentation that it doesn't support full fledge jdbc session in multi-node architecture. Having said that our application is heavily dependent on session and its frequently updating it, i believe its not advisable to use in memory session management through cluster. Because eventually it will increase network call to replicate the session on all nodes.",1294916820

Also the typical patent FUD in this article suggesting that WebM might violate patents without naming them is somewhat indicative of the author's motives.<p>I keep hearing the Flash analogy, which is nonsense, flash doesn't just do video playback, the technology is ubiquitously used in a variety of ways and is not comparable to a video codec, and does not have any of the patent licencing issues h264 has.<p>This move is a step forward towards openness as it will force publishers and users to consider the non-proprietary alternative.",1294916702

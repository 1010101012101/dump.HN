10136164,comment,10133653,10136161,0,0,itchyouch,,,"From her book, &quot;The Wahls Protocol&quot; it is an extension of the popular Paleo diet.  The &quot;level 1&quot; diet is simply:
9 cups of fruits & vegetables per day + 4-6 ounces of organ meats.  Technically all meat is organ meat, but she&#x27;s specifically referring to liver, kidneys, etc)  3 cups of greens, 3 cups of color, 3 cups of sulfur.  Greens are things like spinach, kale, lettuce, etc.  Color are fully deep color items like tomatoes, blackberries, rasberries.  Apples & Banans don&#x27;t count.  Sulfure are items like broccoli, cauliflower, onions, radishes.<p>In her 3rd level she adopts a partially ketogenic (high fat) strategy and drops down the veggies & fruits to 6 cups with a 2/2/2 distribution.  The different levels eliminate certain classes of foods.  Level 1 removes gluten & dairy as they tend to be items that affect a large enough percentage of the population.  Level 2 removes grains & legumes,  Level 3 adds higher fat.  There is also the advice to remove processed foods and oxidized fats, etc.<p>Magnesium(Mg) is responsible for 300+ chemical reactions in the body and is store intracellularly, thus only a limited amount is available.  Too much Mg all at once causes bowel distress.  The way to store large amounts of Mg is to get it from greens in as fibrous of a form as possible. Chlorophyl molecues contain a Mg ion, thus eating greens allows the Mg + other vitamins and minerals to stay in the large intestine for an extended amount of time and be made available for whichever processes are needed.<p>For optimizing lipid metabolism, the supplementing l-carnitine assists with that process.<p>For optimizing general neural stamina, the amino acids (and semi amino-acids) acetyl-l-carnitine, acetyl-l-tyrosine, taurine, l-theanine also have a positive effect on stamina alongside plenty of research on pubmed to corroborate said effects.<p>The neurotransmitters orexin-a (aka hypocretin-a) & histamine are responsible for regulating wakefulness.  orexin receptors are in people&#x27;s eyes.  It&#x27;s the reason people wake up when light comes in.  The light stimulates orexin release into the brain and the brain wakes up.<p>When needing lots of mental energy & stamina, there is already plenty of caloric energy available as lipids in the body.  What is really needed is the assistance of lipid breakdown into Acetyl-COA so that it can become ATP.  Also plenty of potassium, Mg, other vitamins assist in this process.<p>Since insulin & orexin seem to be antagonistic (not sure of the right word) neurotransmitters, glucose intake tends to release insulin, which then &quot;shuts down&quot; the orexin receptors which regulate wakefulness.  Insulin is released based on blood plasma levels of glucose.  Sugar in a high glycemic form as sugar, tends to spike insulin.  If order to optimize for wakefulness, we tends to want to keep insulin levels as low as possible.  Insulin&#x27;s main uses are to signal to the muscles to store up glucose, store away lipids for future energy.  In order to store away muslce glycogen, muscles use up water for storing away glycogen.  Being insulin-resistant (aka pre-diabetes) probably stems from all the glycogen already being stored away and not having any place to store said glycogen, thus blood plasma levels of sugar remain high for extended periods of time.  It makes sense why general exercise (glycogen depletion/use) helps pre-diabetics to go into recovery/remission as glucose can be readily stored away.  This explains a large part of why fasting help with wakefulnes and mental clarity.  Those who have taken provigil understand the feeling of having lots of orexin available in the brain.  It increases mental performance and keep someone awake.  Provigil affects orexin reuptake thus makes that particular neurotransmitter available.  From my experience, Provigil tolerances tend to stem from other nutritional deficiencies and adding the other chemistry helps tremendously.<p>Now as far as resetting the circadian clock.  Orexin being the wakefulness neurotransmitter to hack is what allows one to stay away for extended periods of time.  Having enough orexin to allow someone to power through to a new timezone&#x27;s evening, finally allows the body to reach fatigue at the appropriate evening hour, resets the circadian clock and allows for the adjustment to happen relatively quickly.  I&#x27;ve found that going west is easy.  You stay up longer and wake up later.  The challenge of moving east is difficult as one has to sleep earlier and wake up earlier.  The problem with going east is that it&#x27;s hard to fall asleep early, then staying up allow night means waking up very late and combating the same problem.  One way to go east is to either pull the equivalent of 1-2 all nighters a la orexin hacks (reduce sleepiness via reducing glucose intake).  For those that are awake due to being caffeinated, L-Theanine is the counter to caffeine allowing for more restful sleep despite caffeine intake. Naturally, Caffiene & L-Theanine exist together in green tea leaves and allows for a calming, less jittery effect when consumed together.  L-Theanine also tends to work for helping sleep quality.  The other item to help with sleep is Taurine as it allows for deeper, more restful sleep.  Adding in the chemical components that help sleep and help wakefulness let us hack around how much the body can handle even at older ages.",1440777532

10136161,comment,10133653,10134703,0,0,itchyouch,,,"Definitely agree that this is a useful tool.<p>TLDR - Food & Exercise choices affect wakefulness and neurological stamina & performance.<p>I&#x27;m not an expert by any means, but have done some research on it for various health reasons and would go deeper into it for those on HackerNews who tend to see food hacking as a pointless endeavor where the simplified modal of energy/wakefulness = calories.<p>When we think of bodily energy, we think of calories as fuel.  Yet after certain meals such as Thanksgiving dinner, or a &quot;heavy&quot; lunch, fatigue tends to set in.  If we refocus and consider energy consumption as feeding the cellular mitochondria and assisting cellular ATP transport from the mitochondria, then all of a sudden, it becomes obvious that calories as fuel is somewhat of an inadequate model for optimizing biological chemistry.<p>It&#x27;s intuitively obvious that substances like caffiene, modafinil, amphetamine salts provide a neurological boost by affecting various neurotransmitters & neurons.  The question then becomes what do I need to do to achieve the following: optimize neural stamina via neurotransmitters & bodily ATP generation & consumption?<p>* Increase ATP Stores/Mitochondrial Size (Available mechanical energy)<p>* Increase ATP Usage (Usage of said energy)<p>* Optimize availability of wakefulness enhancing neurotransmitters<p>In a nutshell, supporting the aforementioned biological chemistry becomes what is important.  The trouble with ATP is that it&#x27;s like the L1 cache of processor memory.  There is a relatively small amount of ATP available for use, and when exercising, ATP is used up within several seconds and muscle glycogen is then converted into ATP.  Muscle glycogen (stored away sugar) is kind of like a processors L2 & L3 Cache.  The liver also stores some glycogen and is like main memory.  Food & fatty acid breakdown is like a harddrive (if we are treating data retrieval like energy availability).<p>It becomes obvious that for optimizing energy (ATP) consumption supporting the citric-acid cycle is more important than pure glucose & fatty acid consumption.  Most people have 15+% bodyfat.   That&#x27;s 15lbs of bodyfat per 100lbs of body weight.  5-6lbs of that is essential for hormone production and such, so that leaves around 10 lbs (35,000 calories) of potential energy available for a hypothetical 100lb person.  Most of us reading this are probably somewhere around 130-200+ lbs @ ~20%.  For the hypothetical 100 lb person with 15% body fat, burning 1800 cals per day, that&#x27;s enough energy to last for about 20 days without eating and very little physical activity.<p>Of course it&#x27;s recommended to not stop eating for people looking to diet via starvation as the eventual consumption of all potassium would lead to heart failure.  But there is a story of an obese guy who starved for a year or so and survived on yeast & potassium supplements under medical supervision.<p>As far as increasing our ability to store away glycogen, glycogen is stored in muscles and in the liver.  Increasing muscles increases our ability to store away glycogen.  With weightlifting, the MAX & fastest rates general man can add around 1-2lbs of muscle per month and female can add .5-1 lb of muscle per month for about 1 year for an untrained body. Every year after that, the rates falls about half.  A general male/female can add about 50/25 lbs of muscle in their lifetime.  Yes, lifetime.  For a male, Add 10-20lbs the first year.  Add another 5-10 the next year.  Add another 2-5 the year afterwards.  It tends to be a good idea to maximize muscle production between the ages of 15-30 as the body is growing and generating human growth hormone to stimulate muscle growth.  After 30-35, the body stops overproducing and it tends to be about maintenance and steady losses as the body cannibalizes muscle protein with age.<p>Now that L2/L3 is optimized with extra muscle & hopefully larger and more mitochondria per cell, it becomes important to optimize Main Memory (Liver) & Harddrive (fatty acid breakdown) optimization abilities.  These all function on biological chemistry, thus the limiting chemical reagent is the most important factor to support.  limiting-chemical-reagent meaning obtaining nutrient dense foods.  Adding glucose to the diet without the ability to process said glucose is a recipe for fatigue.  The citric acid cycle pretty much runs on having enough amino-acids (aka protein), oxygen, and supporting minerals & chemicals (magnesium, potassium, vitamins [ABCD...], etc).   The simplest optimization of nutritional intake I&#x27;ve seen is with the Wahl&#x27;s Protocol developed by Terry Wahls.  She has a TED talk explaining her recovery/maintenance from Secondary Progress Multiple Sclerosis.

In network protocol that doesn&#x27;t distinguish between different classes of network hosts, each network peer has the ability to <i>publish on their own</i>. Sure, there are technical details in figuring out how to run your own server. The cost of learning that or paying someone else to handle it is a normal cost of publication (which isn&#x27;t particularly expensive). The point is that there is no authority standing in the way.<p>As you say, if someone doesn&#x27;t like how they are moderated on someone else&#x27;s forum, they have the same ability they had to run their own forum where they get to be the moderator. The catch is that Freedom of Speech doesn&#x27;t guarantee an audience, so getting people to participate is a problem for the individual publishers to solve on their own.<p>Unfortunately, we have lost a lot of this freedom, and that loss is accelerating. NAT has created multiple classes of hosts, some of which cannot publish on their own. This created a culture of software where connections that should be peer-to-peer are brokered through a central authority.<p>We need to regain the true right to publish - where network peers are equal - before these rights are lost completely. The imprimatur[1] is almost finished and the discussion is focused on how people moderate (or don&#x27;t moderate) various forums, when the focus should be on making sure the right run those forums still exists in the future.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.fourmilab.ch/documents/digital-imprimatur/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.fourmilab.ch/documents/digital-imprimatur/</a>",1440777515

Where is the case law to back your belief? Because they insist that the case law is in their favor and instead that for the last few decades:<p>> the Board, without explanation, has since imposed additional requirements for finding joint-employer status, which have no clear basis in the Third Circuit’s decision, in the common law, or in the text or policies of the Act. The Board has never articulated how these additional requirements are compelled by the Act or by the common- law definition of the employment relationship. They appear inconsistent with prior case law that has not been expressly overruled.<p>I take it then that you have not read the decision? It is the central topic at hand, and my quotes from the document, which directly counter comments you made, suggest that you are arguing at this point from ignorance of the actual subject.<p>&quot; do they operate on a franchise basis there as in the U.S&quot;<p>I gave you three links.

So taxes are about a fifth higher. Most people, if given the choice, would accept a 20 percent hike in taxes in exchange for making twice as much.<p>which tells me that your analysis (&quot;that $20 is really closer to $10 or $15 in&quot;) is simply incorrect.<p>At this point I&#x27;ve concluded that you don&#x27;t actually care about the topic, other than to defend personal beliefs, which appear to be anti-labor.",1440777392

It&#x27;s not a binary condition; it&#x27;s a continuum. Also, many people living in homes and probably working at your office are mentally ill; would you trust them in your guest bedroom?<p>* Finally, homeless people (especially those who are mentally ill) are often the weakest in our community, often poorly fed and unable to care for themselves.

The number of &quot;extra chances&quot; that are created from random H and the number of tickets n is 2^256 mod n. So if there are 6 tickets in the lotto, 2^256 % 6 = 4 tickets will have an extra chance to being selected as the winner. If I&#x27;m one of the unlucky ones, my odds of winning just went from 1/6 to 1/10. That&#x27;s a 6.7% bias. The lucky ones&#x27; chances, on the other hand, went from 1/6 to 2/10 = 1/5 which is a 3..3% bias. The bias that a single ticken can get when there are n tickets is (2/(n+(2^256 mod n))) - (1/n)  (except for when 2^256 mod n = 0. Then the bias is 0). The bias goes down as n increases, but I still personally wouldn&#x27;t put my money in the pot.<p>The solution I&#x27;ve seen done (at least in the Rust rand crate) is exactly what you say: throw out every hash >= 2^256 - (2^256 mod n).

10136101,comment,10134009,10134537,0,0,nickpsecurity,,,"I agree with you. I had to design some concepts for securing a boot process or replacing BIOS. My first inspirations were Open Firmware, Coreboot, and U-Boot, already doing much of the job. However, all too complicated, incomplete, or Forthy. So, I saw it from three basic angles drawing on what was done in past:<p>1. Replaceable ROM or read-only, flash chip that the system booted from with open-spec for user customization. You can trust their bootloader, yours, etc. Modifications require physical replacement to avoid software attacks. You can know what it&#x27;s doing because you can flash it yourself or use your own if it&#x27;s physically compatible. Can be cheap. Simple.<p>2. Combination of anti-fuse ROM and flash. The ROM has a highly robust firmware that test chip, initializes some stuff, pulls firmware out of flash, does crypto checks on it, and then runs it. In a maintenance or update mode, the ROM + flash combo can pull up an upgrade into memory, disable all I/O that can affect it, check it, flash it into storage, and reboot. ROM can&#x27;t be modified without physical replacement, so always a root of trust to start with. Can be combined with No 1 if necessary.<p>3. Software-only protection necessitates combating 0-days. This means gotta use an EAL6+ development process. Abstract away hardware details into functions with interface types and checks. Code in safe subset with static analysis, testing, and simulation. Make different device handling pluggable modules to run that interact with safe interface. Extract implementation from that. Examples include using SPARK Ada, MISRA C w/ ASTREE checker, or Java via BootSafe technology. Optionally auto-gen tech like Termite for drivers.<p>Personally, I think we could go with No 1 on everything down to laptops and some tablets. Ultra-compact things such as smartphones can use No 2. No 3 is only for the most stubborn, cost-sensitive companies and those are unfortunately least likely to go the extra mile lol.",1440776966

However, most of what we know about software-engineering expertise are vague stereotypes, such as &#x27;excellent communicators&#x27; and &#x27;great teammates&#x27;. The lack of specificity in our understanding hinders researchers from reasoning about them, employers from identifying them, and young engineers from becoming them. Our understanding also lacks breadth: what are all the distinguishing attributes of great engineers (technical expertise and beyond)? We took a first step in addressing these gaps by interviewing 59 experienced engineers across 13 divisions at Microsoft, uncovering 53 attributes of great engineers. We explain the attributes and examine how the most salient of these impact projects and teams.

Hypotheses abound that the present culture in science may be negatively affecting the reproducibility of findings.

This is not a final ruling on the merits of the case, and it does not have anything (directly) to do with the 4th Amendment. Plaintiffs had moved for a preliminary injunction before the district court that would have stopped the program well before the ultimate outcome of the case. For obvious reasons, the standard for evaluating such requests is high.  One of several factors used for evaluating such a motion is likelihood of ultimate success of the merits.<p>In order for plaintiffs to ultimately succeed, they have to convince the court that they have actually suffered an injury by having their own call records collected. They need to have been injured in order for the court ultimately to have jurisdiction. At this point, the DC Circuit concluded that they do not have any specific evidence of this (and, in fact, some of the indirect evidence weighs against them). So, the DC Circuit concluded that they were not so likely to ultimately succeed that it should give them the injunction they wanted before the ultimate outcome of the case.<p>This is not a good sign for a plaintiffs&#x27; case, but its important to emphasize that this is an early look at it with, necessarily, the benefit of only a small amount of evidence. The case will continue in the district court which will, among other things, try to determine whether the plaintiffs were actually injured.<p>Of course, the predictable outcome of that inquiry is that the NSA will invoke various legal privileges against disclosing the evidence necessary to actually make a determination, ultimately rendering plaintiffs&#x27; case impossible to maintain.",1440776427

Because of the peer pressure I learned about how to do my bits, and I carried on.<p>Later in the year I found fedora, and Blue is a nicer colour than brown (I was young and fickle) but it was less user friendly, so I committed to learn that and get off the &quot;Noob Friendly&quot; Ubuntu OS.<p>Many years later I got a small laptop for my mother, at this stage in my life I was &quot;awoken&quot; and I knew the power a machine could hold if it ran linux, so I put ubuntu on it- She&#x27;s not the most technically apt lady in the world but was able to do most things with ease, and I put that down to having a &quot;Good UX outside microsoft&quot; (since most people who learn the microsoft way are generally committed to a mindset and anything outside of that is pushed away).<p>A few issues with Flash, some performance hiccups on some websites that seemed to try and avoid supporting linux in strange ways (that I take for

Crimes were solved before cell phones even existed, proving that backdoors into software are not needed to solve crimes.<p>I don&#x27;t support requiring back-doors, but it&#x27;s pretty ironic that you call people idiots then immediately follow that with a totally fallacious assertion. Law enforcement didn&#x27;t have back-doors into cell phones before those existed, but criminals also didn&#x27;t have secure ways to communicate over distance in real time. We can&#x27;t conclude anything from the fact that crimes were still solved before cell phones existed.<p>The other way to look at it is to ask: out of the universe of ways for people to communicate, what can the government get at with a warrant? Historically, the answer was: nearly everything. For most of the last century, there was no way to communicate over distance that the government couldn&#x27;t intercept. The only real-time way to communicate over distance was phone, and they&#x27;ve always had a &quot;back door&quot; to the PSTN through wire taps. Think about it: why do mob bosses in old movies take the risk of meeting at shady restaurants, instead of just dialing into a conference number? Because their phones are all tapped!<p>Law enforcement&#x27;s position is that back doors just maintain that long-standing status quo. It may be a bad idea because security should outweigh the needs of law enforcement, but it&#x27;s not an irrational argument.",1440775499

The myth starts with Plato, who cites Solon visiting Sais, Egypt and learning of Atlantis. Plato says Atlantis existed about 9600 BC.<p>My theory goes like this:<p>What Plato/Solon called Atlantis is actually the civilization that once existed in the unflooded persian gulf, from which refuges of the flood fled to surrounding areas (and further) and brought with them the knowledge of civilization they possessed. When I say civilization, I mean the transition from hunter/gatherer society to agricultural society, and possibly writing/proto-writing. (Not the super civilization myth many imagine it as)<p>Allow me to explain and support this assertion as best I can.<p>The Egyptian town Solon visited was the home town of the goddess Neith as far back as 3000 BC, and it was the priests of Neith which gave him the information about Atlantis. Neith is likely to be associated with the god Tanit, who in turn may be associated with the Akkadian god Ishtar, which is actually the counterpart of the Sumerian Inanna.<p>That&#x27;s a lot of connections to make, but what does it matter relevant to this? Well, it matters in two main ways. First, the greek Athena (and hence Athens) is actually derived from, if the above connection is true, the Sumerian Inanna. Plato/Solon placed too much importance on this connection, and in seeking to tie their Athens to the myth of Atlantis, fouled the myth up a bit. (The part about Atlantis and a war with Athens) This is why for so long before the good science of plate tectonics and geology Atlantis was sought in places it could never have been, such as the Atlantic and Mediterranean. The real connection is Sumeria and before.<p>The second part about why the Sumerian connection is so important is purely about timelines. If indeed there was a flood in the Persian Gulf as some of the recent science suggests, at around 8000 BC, it could possibly match the Sumerian King&#x27;s list, which states there was a flood roughly that long ago. (the oldest king on the list verified is back to about 2600 BC, past that the list itself is the only source, which is why I say roughly) So I find it highly likely that much of the ancient history known by the priests of Sais that told Solon about Atlantis is actually the slightly adopted and modified version of the Sumerian flood myth, and this is supported by the study of the evolution of Egyptian religion/history as supported by archaeology.<p>So there you have it. My theory that the flooded southern tip of the fertile crescent at about 8000 BC is the true &quot;Atlantis&quot;. Feel free to poke holes in it or make corrections for any sloppiness on my part. This is something I have thought about for a while but just now put into words.<p>The key thing I would focus on to expand this would be the writings of Plato regarding Solon. I have heard that it was a mistranslation that Plato said 9000 years and that it really reads 900 years, but I have not yet been able to find out where the original text is to ask to for a picture in order confirm/deny this.&quot;<p><a href=""http://phys.org/news/2010-12-lost-civilization-persian-gulf.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://phys.org/news/2010-12-lost-civilization-persian-gulf....</a><p><a href=""http://www.livescience.com/10340-lost-civilization-existed-beneath-persian-gulf.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.livescience.com/10340-lost-civilization-existed-b...</a><p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Recovering-Sarepta-Phoenician-City-Excavations/dp/0691002134"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Recovering-Sarepta-Phoenician-City-Exc...</a><p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumerian_King_List"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumerian_King_List</a><p><a href=""http://www.academia.edu/386944/New_Light_on_Human_Prehistory_in_the_Arabo-Persian_Gulf_Oasis"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.academia.edu/386944/New_Light_on_Human_Prehistory...</a>",1440775213

Given the widespread abuse of methodology (p-hacking, poor understanding of statistics, small or unrepresentative sample sizes, not reporting negative experiments, bad experimental design) this means a lot of &quot;science&quot; is merely varnished prejudice.",1440775149

It&#x27;s promising, but the tools are clearly alpha quality, so if you&#x27;re going to build apps on top of it, you&#x27;re in for some early-adopter hurt.<p>For example, you need the latest Protobuf 3.0 beta release, which no current OS distro currently has, and build gRPC from source. The language-specific packages (Ruby, Node, etc.) have releases that lag behind gRPC itself, so you&#x27;ll probably have to build those from source, too (linking directly to HEAD from a Gemfile or package.json doesn&#x27;t work, last I checked). Performance also seems decidedly lackluster, though it&#x27;s been a few months since I did some casual benchmarking.<p>As for the API and feel of the library, it&#x27;s similar to Thrift, and much like CORBA without the OO and attempts at location transparency. With the current generators, you&#x27;ll get some low-level and not very friendly wrappers generated from the Protobuf declarations that don&#x27;t attempt to hide the fact that you&#x27;re writing RPC requests and responses as Protobuf structs.<p>One disappointing aspect of gRPC at this point is the lack of discoverability. Clients have to connect to a specific host and port, and you have to build your own glue based on ZooKeeper/etcd/Consul/DNS/whatever. Since no fault tolerance is built in, things like retries and load balancing is left as an exercise for the reader.",1440775091

If stability is introduced into their lives, they become less dependent the escape offered by the drug.  In fact, when their drug use is not criminalized, the vast majority of addicts are able to lead normal lives.  This has been shown multiple times in multiple places, even in America as the drug war was gearing up.  Moreover, even the drugs with bad reputations (heroin, cocaine) do not result in addiction for most people who try them.  Those who become addicts largely do so because they have issues that they are using the drug to cope with.  This is evidenced by the lower rates of addiction and petty crime in places where drugs are legalized rather than the sharp increase one would expect if drugs are as dangerously addictive as we are led to believe.<p>There&#x27;s also no need for a nanny state solution for purity testing.  There are already mobile chem labs at festivals which will test your substance for you and tell you exactly what&#x27;s in it, and such services exist elsewhere also.  Furthermore, if drugs were legalized, there would be far fewer instances of adulterated sales to begin with.  It&#x27;s done by unscrupulous dealers--already profiting from the inflated prices that a black market brings--who take advantage of the buyer&#x27;s inability to go to law enforcement to report fraud.  It&#x27;s also done by addicts themselves who need to make money to get their next fix: it&#x27;s easier to cut some of your stuff with baby powder and sell it than it is to steal money or property.  Return to doctors the ability to prescribe narcotics to addicts and this problem virtually disappears.<p>The biggest cause of most (if not all) of the problems that the drug war is supposed to combat is the drug war itself.

I use a password manager for everything except a handful of ultra-critical sites, mostly things involving money or attack vectors to get access to my email. For those sites I don&#x27;t trust to store in LastPass, I write the passwords down on paper. But I also do something I haven&#x27;t seen others recommend:<p><i>Have a (logical) salt for all of the passwords. Don&#x27;t write down that salt.</i><p>So, if you found my piece of paper with passwords, you might see something like this:<p>Etrade - I1999IbmfsaaymIwIbmoi<p>Gmail -  D9cjeawfocsIdkwhtfts4r<p>But my actual passwords are something like this:<p>Etrade - I1999ibmfsaaymIwibmoi804WMainStreet<p>Gmail -  D9cjeawfocsIdkwhtfts4r804WMainStreet<p>804WMainStreet is tacked on to the end of all of them, but you wouldn&#x27;t know that from looking at the sheet of paper. Only my spouse knows the salt, and it&#x27;s easy for us to remember, e.g., maybe 804WMainStreet is the address of the first place we lived together. In theory, this is reducing randomness, which might make it easier to crack one knowing the others, but I&#x27;m not super concerned about that.<p>The two most important elements of security for regular consumers are:
1) Use different passwords for everything.
2) Use multi-factor auth when available.<p>Whatever you have to do to achieve that is better than not doing it.<p>*And I actually use initialism for these passwords so I don&#x27;t have to pull out the piece of paper often, only when I forget. In this example, the Etrade password might be derived from &quot;In 1999 I bought my first stock as a young man. I wish I bought more of it.&quot;",1440774612

There are areas along broad sections of the petal where you might have a few smaller stones perfectly nestled among larger stones -- this gives the impression of a more organic piece, that just sprung out of the ground, plated in diamonds.<p>These are actually examples higher-end jewelry (real gold and diamonds, although mass-manufactured): <a href=""http://slimages.macys.com/is/image/MCY/products/5/optimized/661505_fpx.tif?01AD=3_lgudCYaM2yRk2ireMiwt2AOINLTqoc8djlm_kAxGPynu9D9Mi4LIA&01RI=F2D7967C84D9C00&01NA=&wid=330&hei=404&fit=fit,1&$filterlrg$"" rel=""nofollow"">http://slimages.macys.com/is/image/MCY/products/5/optimized/...</a><p><a href=""http://www.wixonjewelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/rose-gold-diamond-ring_022562_1.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wixonjewelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/rose...</a> in a similar pave style.
You can see all the diamonds are identical, you can see the settings clearly (more metal/space to work with, easier to set)<p>This is another example of pave with better coverage: <a href=""http://i00.i.aliimg.com/wsphoto/v4/1383610324_1/Full-stones-font-b-ring-b-font-Latest-Designs-Dome-Shape-Micro-font-b-Pave-b.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i00.i.aliimg.com/wsphoto/v4/1383610324_1/Full-stones-...</a> Still, uniform diamonds, each one is interchangeable with every other one. In the JAR jewelry, it&#x27;s obvious that each diamond was carefully chosen for its place, the settings are harder to do, and there&#x27;s more color variation throughout.<p>There&#x27;s obviously more to it than that, but that might be a good thing to look for when you&#x27;re considering the artistry that went into these. Also, keep in mind, they&#x27;re not really meant to be worn like day-to-day &quot;jewelry&quot; jewelry we&#x27;re used to seeing around. They&#x27;re more like tiny pieces of elaborate gemstone art.",1440774008

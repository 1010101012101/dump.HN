5748342,comment,5744967,5747227,1,0,HelloMcFly,,,"I agree at the moment. I do have Kinect and had high hopes for the voice commands, but as yet they just take too long to register. However, if it's as good as today's demo implied then we'll be pretty close to, if not at, the level that makes it the simplest (not cheapest) option.<p>> No doubt if there's a good way to do voice control on a TV, Apple's going to figure it out before Microsoft does.<p>I don't have the same blind faith. Apple hasn't put themselves far enough in the living room for me to wait for them. Sure, they got Apple TV, but that seems like barely a side project for them. It's not as good as the cheaper and more versatile Roku, and it's not as bold in thinking as the Xbox One (or even the Xbox 360).",1369187965

5748340,comment,5748053,5748053,31,0,btilly,,,"This sounds to me like nothing more than an abuse of power by a DA.  Those are much more common than people realize.<p>As an example, in a recent case that I'm familiar with in Oregon, a man that I personally know was unjustly charged with 4 criminal charges that the DA knew were unjustified.  He fought.  He won.  He now has, in addition to a crushing legal bill, a bill for the time he spent locked up in prison on trumped up charges?<p>Why did this happen?  Various reasons.  When bf unexpectedly comes home to find his gf having sex with the husband of the house that they're house surfing at, the upset bf can get the gf to make up a rape case.  (The guy shouldn't have been having the affair, but it wasn't rape.)  When said husband is a Native American in a rural area, the DA knows that given racism and the fact that the guy was doing something dislikable, there is a reasonable chance of winning no matter what the facts happen to be.<p>But in my opinion the biggest single factor is that the DA in question is an investor in the private jail to which he sends people.  When the DA can use the powers of the state to send people to prison, and PERSONALLY PROFITS from this, abuse of power is only to be expected.  And even when the DA loses - as in this case - the prison still gets paid.  And if the bill doesn't get paid, care to guess whether a hard line will be taken...?<p>I have no idea how widespread this type of conflict of interest is.  I suspect that it is much more widespread than most people think (because the people who run private jails are well aware that getting the DA on board generates profits).  But as long as it mostly impacts poor people that nobody cares about, it won't be a political issue.",1369187923

But at every new BTCUSD high, it introduces a new group of sellers and eventually all hoarders will get shaken out.<p>I'm not sold on your second point ""someone who sells a Bitcoin for X would have been equally happy to spend it on something they value at X.""  Using daily volume on Gox as an example, just because $2M changed hands yesterday, it doesn't necessarily imply that these folks would have happily exchange their coins for a good or service.  A lot of this volume could represent traders getting in and out of a position, not someone ready to empty their account.

5748147,comment,5747961,5748129,4,0,dietrichepp,,,"I think it's rather natural.  Look at Haskell.  Static typing with type inference was recently extended to allow ""holes"" in the type system.  It lets you run broken programs, and let's be honest, my programs are broken (in some sense) most of the time.  C++ lets you use the ""auto"" keyword in many places.  Maybe the only thing strange here is that Dart has more of the ""dynamic by default"" mentality, but that's not strange either if you look at languages like Common Lisp, which have optional type annotations.<p>Here's optional type annotations in Haskell, which uses type inference by default but lets you override types with annotations.  Note that f and g have different types, but the same body.<p><pre><code>    -- Haskell\n    f = return 5\n\n    g :: IO Int\n    g = return 5\n</code></pre>\nHere it is in Lisp, which uses dynamic typing by default but lets you specify types with annotations.<p><pre><code>    ; Dynamic +3 function\n    (defun add3 (x) (+ x 3))\n\n    ; Static +3 function for integers\n    (defun add3 (x)\n      (declare (type integer x))\n      (+ x 3))</code></pre>",1369184701

Right right.<p>You're a SiliconValleyVC whose submission history is 2 privco articles.

If you've seen the docs, share them.<p>2.  There was no ad-hominem attack. Fred called your data b.s. He has the #s so is in a good position to make that claim.<p>I can understand you're trying to save face for Privco after respected VC's Fred Wilson, Bijan Sabet have called you out. Plus, today, editors of 3 major tech publications called you out -- Jay Yarrow of Biz Insider, Eric Eldon of TechCrunch and Mike Isaac at AllThingsD all said Privco data and claims are incorrect and hyperbolic.<p>Pls don't insult us here with this very sad attempt at covering for your employer/company.",1369184515

He accepts the feedback and also wants Heroku to help RapGenius 'modernize their stack'. That's not a full and proper solution, nor a remedy for the lost cost/effort so far, but it would have offered a lot of performance and cost relief.<p>In fact, I think that's why this problem festered: many customers managed to soften the pain by going to Cedar, multiple-workers, app-optimizations, and more dynos... so deeper investigations kept getting backburnered, both inside and outside Heroku, until now.<p>RapGenius has done us a mitzvah by finally digging deeper, but I'm still eager to see what Heroku thinks the right remedies are, beyond RapGenius's 'must do' ultimatums.",1361156215

Note that I no longer work for New Relic and my opinions are my own, not those of New Relic or my current employer.<p>I don't recommend that you use this patch - work needs to be done on Heroku's end, this is not a satisfactory workaround. The ideal would be for them to add a timestamp to the headers at the front end of the dyno machine (i.e. in apache/nginx/whatever) to allow the calculation to include a local-machine-relative timestamp rather than one reliant on two servers being in sync.<p>The major issue is that servers on AWS do not have synchronized clocks, in general. I'm not sure how Heroku manage their servers, but I do know that in the samples I saw several years ago, we had a very large variance in the queue time reported based solely on that clock skew.<p>The New Relic reported value is an average, which is a poor choice for something like this, but it's very difficult to graphically illustrate queue time across a network of machines without resorting to it.<p>I'd be happy to discuss it further, and I know that sgrock [1] is also around the neighborhood - he's one of the current Ruby Agent maintainers.<p>1: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=sgrock"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=sgrock</a>",1361155673

5237871,comment,5236234,5237694,6,0,tolmasky,,,"Your argument would be stronger if you didn't have such disrespect for the people you don't agree with. The argument wouldn't be that everyone would test foods with handheld chemo whatever's, but rather that private analogs to the FDA would exist. Think consumer reports for health/nutrition vs product quality. The thinking is that one of the problems with the FDA is that since it is a government agency, it reacts to these things slowly and is prone to corruption. Most people say ""I can eat anything on the shelf because the government has taken the time to make sure its not bad for me, they always go on and on about the success of the FDA after all"". The problem is that oftentimes there are problems with things even if they are approved. If you instead had independent agencies doing this, there is a possibility that we would have a culture that leaned more towards research and discussion (the same way people ask all the time about which computer to buy). I'm sure you'll argue that corruption would happen here too, but the idea is that having multiple agencies, all of which are reasonably legally liable (unlike a government agency where if they make a mistake its particularly difficult to punish them), allows competition so its harder to buy out <i>everyone</i> when you create an interest in an upstart showing how you were wrong in your analysis. With the FDA, there may be opposing sides (e.g. let's say the ""organic"" lobby and the ""farmers"" lobby that could potentially try to convince the FDA of one thing or another), but at the end <i>one</i> decision is made.<p>I am in no way arguing that this point of view is correct, however essentially calling people with opposing viewpoints idiots doesn't convince anyone of your side, it makes you appear like you have not actually taken the time to listen to those arguments, and thus will at best only preach to the choir. Of course if this was only meant to be a rant, then carry on.<p>EDIT: This article shows what I was referring to in terms of ""binary decisions"": <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/04/health/use-of-antibiotics-in-animals-raised-for-food-defies-scrutiny.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/04/health/use-of-antibiotics-...</a><p>The FDA has been hesitant to tackle this in the past because it feels it hasn't had sufficient evidence. This is why we perhaps need a gradient instead of approved/disapproved. With multiple competing agencies, some would be much more conservative and be willing to speak up sooner. The point I'm trying to make is that people who disagree with you look at the current situation with antibiotics and say ""see, here we have the FDA and this is <i>still</i> happening"". Whereas you say ""See, this is happening and why we need the FDA"".",1361155539

The problem is that, at least to me, a Javascript code base of around 2000 lines already becomes unreadable, specially when you consider some common patterns like 'declare a function to define a namespace'. You normally end up with functions inside of functions, calling jQuery event handlers by declaring yet another inline function... By the time you use a 'for' loop, you already are 4 indentation levels/brackets in. Messy.<p>As you say, libraries work around a lot of these problems, but most of these workarounds are hacks. 'require.js', for example. And you shouldn't need to use underscore to get sane typing. About OO... It's debatable, I think languages like CoffeeScript and TypeScript have done a good job of abstracting the weirdness, but that's the thing: they are languages that compile to Javascript.<p>Anyway, I like Javascript, don't get me wrong, it's just that I don't think it's a great choice for big codebases. I know I get a lot of hate every time I say this, but to me Node.js is an excellent example of using the right tool for the wrong job. Had the energy been put behind developing the same concept as a library to a language with a decent standard library, so much work would've been saved 'catching up'.",1361154609

While they watched I wrote a quickie chrome extension that moved the Compose button in gmail to a different location. Change facebook chat box size. No reaction. These were bright kids who'd never shown the slightest interest in programming and I was once again despairing that they never might[2].

They did that and it showed up on my computer.

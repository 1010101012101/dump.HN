At this moment, we're thinking of developing a gateway in a region that does not have a single online payment gateway, with huge e-commerce potential and with many, many online solutions out there that are too expensive and just a terrible cheap alternative to a payment gateway.<p>I already know all about IPC compliant and that's not an issue. My question is what would be the best way to reach the dozen or so payment processor platforms? Is it the best way to just reach to an arm acquiring bank in the region, or is there any other ways/companies that assist in doing so?<p>Thank you!",1364273950

5441483,comment,5439638,5440610,1,0,bhb916,,,"This comment is one big logic failure. First, a claim that policy has been intentionally written to redistribute wealth upwards and then as evidence two charts that don't show policy or intention.  The next link indicates the results of a study on inequality preferences without actually explaining how that relates to anything in particular (hint: it doesn't). Then, a claim that the US is a consumer based economy which is a peculiar statement about the nation with the greatest manufacturing output in the world (1) and the 3rd most competitive manufacturing sector (2). Finally, I can't tell if you're being sarcastic about economic policy in the 1930s or not, but I'm going to suggest a refresher course in the material just in case.<p>The parent comment wasn't really talking about economic inequality directly anyhow, it was discussing the potential danger inherent in an democratic system when the majority willingly votes away the property of the minority. I don't necessarily agree that this is what's going on currently, but it is something that was frequently of concern to revolution-era scholars. Regardless, your comment seems like it was meant to scratch some political itch instead of actually discussing the topic.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R42135.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R42135.pdf</a>

5441477,comment,5440909,5440909,43,0,jowiar,,,"Once upon a time (1969-ish), my father was hired as a programmer. He was an electrical engineer by training, but had zero programming experience at the time. Given a shortage of programmers, IBM placed an ad in the newspaper, hired smart people, and taught them how to program. Assembly. On mainframes.<p>40+ years later, companies are in a similar situation, but instead, given a shortage of engineers, they are simply whining about it. Presumably, with tools that are 40+ years better that making it ""easier"" to program, such a system of the past would be reasonably replicable today, no? I've seen a few things pop up here and there - hungryacademy and such, but, by and large, this is the exception far more than the rule. Once upon a time, companies would hire and develop talent, investing years to develop the talent with years of rewards on the end for both sides of the deal. Now? Companies expect hires to come fully trained, ready to deliver from day one, at their own expense (and much debt to the banks). Employees have no loyalty (and for good reason).",1364273798

In fact it's far from obvious, and learning the sense in which it's far from obvious is (in my experience) an important milestone, after which one stops arguing naively about readability and starts thinking more about the intelligibility of whole programs. If composed ternaries are an idiom that jQuery employs to do certain things compactly and repeatedly, that convention may well make it easier to understand jQuery. And that is what mattersnot helicoptering into arbitrary bits of code.<p>In terms of lines of codean imperfect metric but a useful onehis rewritten example is twice as long. That may seem like a small price to pay for an easier-to-understand snippet <i>in isolation</i> but if you start thinking about a complex system as a whole, and consider how complexity compounds as programs grow, that intuition changes considerably.<p>(I'm done being patronizing now.)",1364273704

You can start by learning Groovy and applying it in the Struts world that you know and love. Then you can try out Grails and get a feel for a Rails-like framework. Then you if you like it you can jump over to Rails and you'll find a lot of what you learned from Groovy / Grails is very conceptually similar. By doing it this way you can widen your knowledge without ever having to make the big jump that can be so disorienting, and all of the above technologies are worthy of learning in their own right.",1364273651

The About page shows a pretty senior, experienced team (decades of engineering and research experience): <a href=""http://summly.com/about.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://summly.com/about.html</a><p>And the technology page says the algorithm is actually from SRI!  <a href=""http://summly.com/technology.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://summly.com/technology.html</a>  (SRI language technology was also behind Siri, of course.)  There are various NLP researchers on their SRI team list, like Appelt, Israel, Nallapati, etc.  Did Summly license the technology from SRI?  Did they contract with SRI to maintain or develop the core algorithm?  Who owns it?<p>If the valuation includes Yahoo acquiring SRI technology, IP, and some portion of those researchers' time for futher product development, plus the very nice UI and marketing for it, and maybe they want to acquihire some of the team as well, that all makes the valuation seem a bit less far-fetched than you might think from the NYT's coverage (or the negative comments on HN).<p>The more interesting question than the valuation, I think, is how this company went from a very young founder to all those investors, a pretty senior executive team, and getting the NLP technology.<p>[I once worked for a startup, Powerset, whose core NLP system was licensed from Xerox PARC; Powerset also quietly acquired an SRI spinoff and its NLP technology, and I think IP acquisition was an important motivation.  When Powerset was acquired by Microsoft, I am told IP was at least a somewhat important part of the valuation.

There are exceptions, but in most wars the enlisted men themselves have not been the ones chomping at the bit to be sent to war. Rather, they were sent by older men serving in government, who did not themselves participate in the fighting, often over considerable dissent from the rank and file. In some cases, such as the U.S.&#x27;s participation in Vietnam, the wars were <i>exceedingly</i> unpopular among the young people actually sent to fight them.",1429232365

9391716,comment,9391151,9391151,0,0,glabifrons,,,"I don&#x27;t see how hybrid-aircraft make any sense.<p>The whole point of hybrid cars are the fact that you&#x27;re only on the throttle periodically. You start, stop, speed up, slow down all the time (especially in S. Florida!). Normally when you&#x27;re slowing down, you&#x27;re burning off the energy as heat (friction from the brakes), etc. \nAdding an electric motor/generator to this allows you to recapture energy that is normally wasted slowing back down, so it can be reused to re-accelerate back up to speed. This is why hybrids (unlike non-hybrid cars) get better fuel mileage in town than on the freeway.<p>Aircraft, on the other hand, are at full-throttle on takeoff, and close to 3/4 throttle during the vast majority of the flight. There is no slowdown to recoup the energy until coming in for a landing. @beloch has already done the math showing the electric range would be downright miniscule, so there&#x27;s very, very little to be gained here.<p>Until we have some utterly astounding advances in battery (or more likely, supercapacitor) tech (probably via graphene), this won&#x27;t really be a cost-effective solution.<p>However, this would be an absolutely incredible motor for electric car conversions.\nImagine a pair of these (each powering an axle)... it would be considerably more powerful than even the Tesla Model S P85D.",1429232287

Slack fits into that mold, though the sale price would probably be orders of magnitude higher than those acquisitions (likely upwards of $10 billion, possibly much more). At that price tag, it might be untenable.<p>Not sure what Slack&#x27;s medium-longer terms goals are, honestly. Their valuation is so high that only megacorps can afford them, but there&#x27;s still enough risk that public markets might be skeptical (their revenue growth is astronomical, but they haven&#x27;t been generating revenue for THAT long).

9391688,comment,9389982,9390697,0,0,fennecfoxen,,,"Hmm. First, I thought that most real-estate-backed bridge loans were supposed to <i>reduce</i> the risk, by the very nature of backing it up with property (or home equity). This is in stark contrast with a zero-documentation no-money-down subprime loan -- only people who have spent a lot of time building equity will get this sort of a deal.<p>My understanding suggests that the main time you, an individual, would do a bridge loan, is if you wanted to buy a house and use the home equity in the house you haven&#x27;t sold yet as your down payment. If that&#x27;s the case, you put the cash in the down payment, and aren&#x27;t expected to pay it back if the house you&#x27;ve vacated is seized. Nothing about this process seems intrinsically unfair to anyone (yet) though the process is probably an expensive way to get that money.<p>I&#x27;m not sure why you&#x27;d put them into bonds. Besides being freakishly irregular loans, they&#x27;re generally designed to be very short-term, which it seems would be an impediment to securitization -- doubly so when you&#x27;re talking about a business bridge-loan instead of a real-estate one. Are you sure your presumption is accurate?<p>And, just for what it&#x27;s worth, even payday loans can be very attractive if the alternative is worse (e.g. please give me a $500 payday loan so I can go pay my fine and retrieve my car from the impound lot so the city of SF stops charging me $65.75/day in fees. thanks.)",1429231713

Just because men are evolutionarily predisposed to go to war doesn&#x27;t mean that not wanting them to go to war is rejecting the theory of evolution. Evolution only shows us <i>what is</i>. (In the case of evo-psych, it&#x27;s usually more like <i>what may have been</i>.) Meanwhile, it&#x27;s our job to figure out <i>what ought to be</i>, and to defer to evolution on that point is nothing but intellectual laziness.<p>Just because men choose to go to war doesn&#x27;t mean that they are not also victims of a social order that glorifies war and gives them a warped idea of what it means to be male. These can both be true. Politics always takes advantage of pre-existing psychological propensities, but it also reinforces them and reshapes them to its advantage over many generations. In fact, most questions in the form of &quot;did X cause Y or vice versa?&quot; in politics and sociology can be answered as &quot;duh, it&#x27;s a feedback loop.&quot;<p>Humans are subject to evolutionary pressures like any other life form. But one of the major differences between us and other animals is that we can recognize when our biology predisposes us to participate in evil, and counter it with our intelligence and strength of will.<p>If evolution is taking us places where we don&#x27;t want to go, we have the intelligence and technology to give the middle finger to evolution and shape our own destinies. That includes telling young men that they no longer need to kill other men in order to be acknowledged as upstanding members of our society.<p>EDIT: An earlier version of this comment included the following rant, which was meant as an aside. But too many people seemed to think that it was my main point, so I&#x27;m moving it to the end.<p>> <i>&quot;I don’t put any political agenda into my work. I think the right wing tends to idolize soldiers—you can&#x27;t talk about them critically in any way. The left wing went from vilifying them in Vietnam to seeing them as victims of a military-industrial complex.&quot; He laughs over the phone. &quot;Both views of soldiers are just absurd.&quot;</i><p>It&#x27;s funny how every time I hear someone say they have no political agenda, or that they are neutral, they almost always go on to devote the vast majority of their effort to criticizing the left wing. Maybe they secretly endorse the right wing, or maybe they think the right wing is not even worth criticizing. In either case, I find this fascinating.",1429231290

It&#x27;s mass is approx. 200 kg, so the Siemens engine frees up 150 kg of weight.<p>-It&#x27;s fuel capacity is 237 kg of 100LL avgas.  With an energy density of 44.0 MJ/kg, this gives the plane a stored energy of 10.4 GJ.  The plane&#x27;s max range is 1300 km.<p>-Tesla&#x27;s best battery (the Smart) has an energy density of 132 WH/kg, which is 475.2 kJ/kg. That means you&#x27;d need 21.9 thousand kilograms of battery to store the same energy that&#x27;s in the Cesna&#x27;s tank when full.<p>-If we assume the plane&#x27;s range is linearly related to it&#x27;s stored fuel (an approximation not really accounting for take-offs), 237 kg plus the 150 kg saved in engine weight gives 0.051 GJ of stored energy, which would reduce the plane&#x27;s range to 5% of normal, or about 63 km.<p>Based on this, don&#x27;t expect an EV passenger plane anytime soon.  Battery technology just isn&#x27;t good enough yet.  A hybrid with a gas-turbine generator is much more likely in the near future.  This engine may also have applications where range is not important, such as training, stunt and racing planes.",1429230856

If you are charging $5 per game and you spend $100k developing then you simplistically need 30k installs just to break even. When the app store was small and you had a good chance of being the only app in your category that was not hard to achieve. When you are just 1 of 100 other apps in your same category it is 100 times harder to achieve. If you could charge $20 or $50 which was historically how software was priced then you could tolerate 4x - 10x less installs, but the app store culture has been permanently set now such that it will not tolerate that. 99c apps got Apple off to a great start, but it has locked in a situation where only the largest (or most sophisticated) developers that can reliably get to the top of the charts can stay afloat.",1429229943

We&#x27;re a small HipChat-using company who moved three teams over for a month, and the communal response was &quot;eh?&quot;. It&#x27;s no-doubt prettier and easier to write integrations, but for the core competency of chatting, the two were very similar (and most people preferred the native HipChat apps to the Slack browser one). It&#x27;s big selling point for us was integration with Google Docs, and in testing we found that it didn&#x27;t work that well.<p>It&#x27;s also 3.5x more expensive. In absolute terms that&#x27;s not much (<$400 a month), but no one could point to $400 of incremental value in it. If we fully embraced it and turned off emails for those teams, would we see it? Maybe, but we&#x27;d still need emails to deal with external vendors, and there&#x27;s no way that we&#x27;d get non-developers to see it as an email replacement.",1429229351

The main feature of it seems to be that it&#x27;s new, so when you first start using it only the 5 other people that you are collaborating with right now are on there, so it starts off feeling more productive and focused than other tools.<p>But then, I thought the same thing about Twitter (how is this not worse that every other IRC / IM service I&#x27;ve ever used?) and look what happened there.",1429229231

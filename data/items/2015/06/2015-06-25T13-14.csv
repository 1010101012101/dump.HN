We should be reminded that disrupting industries sometimes creates losers in the working and middle class that don&#x27;t have an easy way to switch jobs in some countries or economies.&quot;<p>This is absolutely true, but it has always been so, for countless professions across the centuries.<p>Industrialization, automatization, globalization have caused many people to lose their livelihood due to the obsolescence of their industry and profession, but the net result has always  been a richer, more modern society (whether if &#x27;happier&#x27; or &#x27;better&#x27;, it&#x27;s hard to say).<p>Taxi drivers happen to be a much more vocal, compact and uniform community, and that&#x27;s why they appear more in the news, but there are countless other people being affected by technical progress on a daily basis (from journalist to shoe repairers to travel agents).<p>While it might not be a zero-sum game, to reference a famous pg essay, it&#x27;s a bit naive thinking that entrepreneurs can create value out of nothing, without affecting the existing status-quo in other ways than positive ones.<p>Instead of fighting it by enforcing ad-hoc laws, governments and unions should work towards creating the conditions so that the affected workers are able to find  other occupations, IMHO.",1435240783

9777892,comment,9776141,9776719,0,0,Galanwe,,,"> Now you understand a lot of what&#x27;s been wrong with software development at places like MS over the last decade and more.<p>I don&#x27;t think that actually _is_ the main reason why MS had(ve) so many problems.<p>In the end, people have minds and brains, and they know (at every layer) that the system is bullshit.
Whatever is written on you performance review, your manager will know what he will need to write (or advise you to write) to get you a promotion, if he thinks you deserve one. And the same apply for the manager of your manager, etc.<p>Don&#x27;t forget that in places like MS (or other big corps), you cannot really climb the ladder faster that the others. Everything is more or less ruled by your years of experience, etc. At most, good performance reviews will help you get promoted a tiny bit earlier.<p>This clearly discourages very talented developers. Let me clarify this.<p>At most companies I&#x27;ve worked, there are always some minority of really bad developers, a majority of OK or good developers, and a minority of really talented one.<p>Very roughly that would look like:<p>- 10% bad
- 80% OK/good
- 10% very talented<p>The bad developers usually are there since a while (say 5/10 years). They learned to stick to _their_ little tiny project and don&#x27;t do much aside from it. They just do the bare minimum so that they don&#x27;t get fired and that&#x27;s why they are here years later.<p>At MS things were really different. There were no bad developers..., and no very talented developers. It was, like, 100% of good/ok developers.<p>Why?<p><i>Because MS is not driven by technology. MS is driven by business.</i><p>1. <i>MS thinks every developer is replaceable by any other one, given some warmup time.</i><p>2. <i>MS thinks the technology is not important, only the final product/feature is.</i><p>3. <i>MS lives in a completely isolated bubble.</i><p>Now let me explain how these two points made MS fall this low. Of course this is my personal view, and I guess some won&#x27;t agree.<p>1. MS doesn&#x27;t value developers as individual contributors. MS values &quot;teams&quot;, as a workforce. You will never be valued individually. You team will, or you project will, but not _you_. MS won&#x27;t try to understand how you feel, what you think, or try to make you stay. It&#x27;s just too big of a company to care at the developer level.
This means the turn over at MS is high, and the management is used to it.<p>2. This may be a personal view, but most of the time when I work somewhere, I don&#x27;t give a shit about the business itself. You can build a rocket, a vacuum cleaner, or whatever, I don&#x27;t care. I only care about the IT side of the project: are there interesting challenges? Do I like the stack? how old is the code base? etc.
At MS, a developer is expected to think exactly the contrary. You should have no interest in the technological stack, and only care about improving the product.
This means:<p>- most of the time you won&#x27;t have the choice of the technological stack, this is demotivating<p>- you will have to use a stupid stack, because a somehow similar previous project used it and it worked (someone said so)<p>- you will never innovate technologically, that&#x27;s of 0 business value.<p>3. Now this is a really funny one. At MS, management lives in an other version of internet. They read only MS friendly & specialized websites, newspapers, etc.
This is absolutely insane. Guys are absolutely sure that the whole internet is super focused on what they do, deeply care of every single thing that they say, etc. They will send mails like &quot;look at the awesome article that is on the front page of TECHCRUNCH! the whole internet talks about us&quot;, and link you to non technical, pure BS article written by a guy paid by MS to write it.
Funny sidenote: When I relocated to an other country with MS, I had a girl from a local travel company show me the country. She was a contractor, and explained me that she had a training specially for MS employees, where they would teach her not to send mails through gmail, not to send maps using google maps, not to show her iphone, when talking with MS employees. The management of MS lives in its own bubble, they are 100% sure that bing is used by everyone, they are 100% that the new Skype is awesome, they are 100% that windows server rocks and all modern websites use IIS.",1435240769

9777887,comment,9777270,9777697,0,0,nyandaber,,,"The fun part is that a taxi licence is delivered for free by the city, provided you fit the criterias. But taxis don&#x27;t want too many licences to be around of course, so they lobbied for a low limit to be delivered (which may or may not be revisionned when a city increase in size/population). They built this bubble themselves and now they&#x27;re crying about it. Since last year you can&#x27;t resell your licence anymore, obviously it only works for the new ones delivered, otherwise the country would get sued and loose instantly.

9777876,comment,9769260,9775571,0,0,couchand,,,"Nope, that&#x27;s still just passing in data, from the point of view of the function receiving the data.  Passing data to a function is just a regular old function call.<p>However, you could consider that the caller of the function could have had the stream injected, depending on the perspective of the rest of the application.<p>For instance in pseudocode:<p><pre><code>    useData = (data) ->
        munge(data) + calculate(data)

    setupPipeline = (input, output) ->
        input
            .pipe cleanup
            .pipe useData
            .pipe format
            .pipe output

    application = ->
        setupPipeline stdin, stdout

    test = ->
        setupPipeline mockInput, mockOutput
</code></pre>
Notice how I&#x27;ve included the test case to illustrate how the dependency injection enables testability, which is critical to understanding the concept.  Without DI, the setupPipeline method would take no parameters and explicitly hook to stdin/stdout.<p>Contrast this example with the standard case of regular-old-data-passing:<p><pre><code>    useData = (data) ->
        munge(data) + calculate(data)

    application = ->
        useData stdin.getInt()

    test = ->
        assert.equal -1, useData 42
        assert.equal 0, useData 100
        assert.equal 1, useData 99
</code></pre>
Note how inversion of control is not necessary to unit test this function, which is the indication that there is no dependency injection going on there.<p>If you were using dependency injection for the behaviors, it would imply that the injection is <i>not strictly necessary</i>, and you could instead write the function with a hard dependency.  Since the behavior just takes data that whole idea is nonsensical.  What would it bind to?  Nothing.  It&#x27;s just taking data.",1435240595
9777875,comment,9776263,9777541,0,0,pdkl95,,,"Maintaining IPC/RPC as text has the significant advantage of keeping the programs involved honest, approachable, and easier to debug. Just being able to <i>see</i> the interface by running the program (or reading the config file) makes it a lot easier to learn[1], and bugs in text formats can often be seen visually (or marked in an editor).<p>The alternative - binary structures - require complex data definitions where you have to care about stuff like exact byte lengths when you have to convert between big/little endian. Some people like to claim that binary is faster, but your bottleneck is not going to be strtol(3). As for advantages in parsing - you still have to parse the binary structure you just read. I suspect most people that think &quot;parsing text&quot; is difficult are confusing the <i>parser</i> with <i>lexer</i>; the latter is the only part that changes when you switch between text and binary formats.<p>In the long run the initial investment in a text interface can be cheaper than wasting time debugging binary structures. Even more important when thinking long-term: it is a <i>lot</i> easier to inspect a text interface from the outside without the consent or availability of the original author. If you have an old program binary that was used in production for years and no source code or documentation, which would you rather try to debug? An opaque binary file? Or something in JSON or INI format?<p>[1] however, this is not an excuse to skip proper documentation",1435240593

The small amount of effort I put in going through transactions in YNAB each week (it doesn&#x27;t take more than 10 minutes, and it learns the frequent categorisations) really makes me think about where I&#x27;m spending money.<p>The only work I have to do is downloading transaction data from my bank each week, which is simple, and has the side-effect of encouraging me to minimise the number of accounts I have open, because it makes managing YNAB simpler.<p>YNAB&#x27;s not free software, but it is occasionally on sale. Even at full price it&#x27;s well worth the money, provided that you really want to take control of your spending.

Then when stuff needs to get serious, you can bypass the command-line front end and connect directly over RPC using a strict message format which has the ability to handle a couple (doesn&#x27;t have to many) of concurrent requests.<p>Of course this is early doors yet, but I think it might have legs in the flexibility in the text streams/hard message format debate, for very little additional work.",1435239489

If you cannot trust someone&#x27;s judgement, and they spew crap, repeatedly, then the odds that they&#x27;re blowing smoke elsewhere increase.<p>It&#x27;s the same reason that lawyers seek to impugn witnesses or call into question credibility. Or, to pick another hobby horse of mine, there are news and media organizations which spew crap. Fox News gets a lot of much-deserved scorn for this, but they&#x27;re not the only one. Bullshit in media (in the most general meaning of the word: <i>any</i> information delivery system) is something I&#x27;ve been paying a lot of attention to, and I&#x27;m rather sensitive to it.<p>Case in point recently involves a 123 year old quote I&#x27;d seen attributed to J. P. Morgan, the Gilded Age banker. It struck me as curious, and I dug into it. My conclusion: it&#x27;s a hoax.<p>The item in question is referred to as the Banker&#x27;s Manifesto of 1892, or as the Wall Street Manifesto. Almost certainly the fabrication of one Thomas Westlake Gilruth, lawyer, real estate agent, community activist, and some-time speaker and writer for People&#x27;s Party causes in the 1890s and 1900s. (Pardon the digression: there <i>is</i> a point, it happens to be both fresh in my mind and sufficiently detached from contemporary affairs to be a fair foil.)<p>Among the evidence I turned up, several contemporaneous newspapermen who&#x27;d drawn the same conclusion. Mind that this was a time of <i>highly</i> partisan press, but these were editors of People&#x27;s Party papers in various locales.<p>From <i>The advocate and Topeka tribune.</i> (Topeka, Kan.), 7 & 14 Sept. 1892:<p><i>The Great West and one or two other exchanges reproduce the Chicago Daily Press fake purporting to be a Wall street circular. The thing originated in the fertile brain of F. W. Gilmore [sic: should be T. W. Gilruth], who held a position for a time at the Press. He has been challenged time and again to produce the original if it is genuine, and has failed to do so. The thing is a fraud and so is its author, and neither of them is worthy of the confidence of the people.</i><p>The following week&#x27;s issue corected the typo with a emphasis on why naming and shaming mattered:<p><i>We desire to make this correction lest there be somebody named Gilmore who might object to the charge, and because the fraud should be placed where it belongs. Gilruth is a snide, and if anyone who knows him has not yet found it out, he is liable to do so to his sorrow.</i><p><a href=""http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85031982/1892-09-07/ed-1/seq-6/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85031982/1892-09-07...</a><p><a href=""http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85031982/1892-09-14/ed-1/seq-6/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85031982/1892-09-14...</a><p>From the <i>Barbour County index.,</i> July 06, 1892, p. 1<p><i>If the genuineness of this dispatch cannot be established, it should be taken in at once.

There&#x27;s also a distinction I draw between <i>occasionally being wrong</i> (errors happen), and <i>systematic bias</i>.

(The two rates don&#x27;t have to be the same.) A fixed rendering rate tends to make the game better to play (though of course this is a bit subjective), and a fixed game update rate avoids nasty timing-dependent bugs (e.g., due to parameters that work fine until you have overly long or short timesteps). Both have to cater for the commonly-encountered worst cases rather than the best ones.<p>(30Hz is somewhat common as rendering these days tends to involve a lot of fixed-cost full-screen passes for lighting and postprocessing. So by halving your frame rate you get over double the effective rendering time, which you can spend on having more stuff, higher res, etc.)<p>Even for 30Hz games, during development it&#x27;s very common for the game not to run reliably at even 30Hz, until towards the end, at which point stuff is taken out, and assets and code optimised to make it all work. So it&#x27;s not a cap that artificially limits performance so much as a floor that the developers are striving to hit :)<p>(I have no idea what the problem with Batman is specifically.)",1435237786

I don&#x27;t imagine French taxi drivers earn a whole lot of money. Moreover, an idea could be that the French taxi drivers could just switch over to Uber. The tax driver may be stuck if they have already paid a certain amount of a car, registration, etc.<p>Also, they may not be able to make as much with Uber. Buzz Feed News estimated that US Uber drivers can make $34,164 per year. French laws may also include benefits for driving a taxi vs. being an independent contractor with no benefits with Uber.<p>Services like AirBnB and Uber can be great for entrepreneurs, investors, part-time workers, and consumers. We should be reminded that disrupting industries sometimes creates losers in the working and middle class that don&#x27;t have an easy way to switch jobs in some countries or economies.",1435237235

thus

410492,comment,410179,410420,0,0,Hexstream,,,"I'm sorry, I don't really have any insightful perspective on debugging. But maybe I can elaborate a bit on what goes wrong if you make a new DSL without keeping in mind debugging considerations.<p>- You'll want to maintain a separate stack for your embedded DSL. It's really, really hard to debug when Lisp's stack and your DSL's get intertwined in a complex way in your stack trace. When I just had my straightforward HTML and CSS ""closure-compilers"" this wasn't such a big deal but when you make a language with more funky semantics where the order of evaluation is less obvious it's a real problem.<p>- When you compile something (say, your semantic representation of HTML into optimized closures), you should always keep the more semantic representation of what you're compiling around. As an example of this, at first I made a macro to directly generate Lisp code that generates HTML source code. That was bad because the only thing I could do with my HTML is output it.<p>But it turns out there are many things you can do if instead you make a macro that generates Lisp code that will build a semantic representation of HTML as Lisp objects: you can interpret it directly or optimize it or compile it directly or make a single-stepping debugger... The possibilities are limitless!<p>Also, to preserve semantics as much as possible I think a rewriting strategy is great. You start with your super abstract representation, and then you rewrite in successive steps to an ever more concrete and low-level representation until you're done. For example, in an HTML system you'd have a login-box object that rewrites to HTML lisp objects that rewrites to HTML source code. It would be great to have a way of linking the various pieces at the different semantics level. For example, having some feature Explain that when you point to a certain character in the HTML source, it could tell: ""This character was generated as part of the value of the text attribute of a img node that was generated in that page because it's part of the sidebar that's in the template of this part of the site""... Anyway, what I mean is that sometimes you want to focus on the high-level semantics and other times on the low-level, and you should be able to switch contexts at will.<p>PS: I'm not even sure what exactly I was talking about anymore. Maybe I should start a blog...",1230330550

410483,comment,410080,410186,0,0,jmtame,,,"Computer Science is a discipline applied to something, such as doing coding at a startup.  Most CS students turn out to be coders.  Not many people, for example, are going to go off and write new compilers and program in MIPS assembly.  Most will end up doing the typical Java and C/C++ development stuff.  My roommate for example doesn't have any interest in AI or machine learning or data mining (although I'm not necessarily referring to those fields as being easily outsourced).<p>The complaint I'm making is one that has been voiced already by many universities, including my own (Illinois.edu).  It's the reason schools like Olin College are getting built and considered by Newsweek and Kaplan as ""one of America's next Ivy League schools.""

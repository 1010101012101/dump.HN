9278650,comment,9277269,9277269,0,0,peterwwillis,,,"Opportunistic Encryption is harmful because people think it&#x27;s actually useful. Here&#x27;s the problem with opportunistic encryption:<p><pre><code>  OE provides unauthenticated encryption over TLS for data that would otherwise be\n  carried via clear text. This creates some confidentiality in the face of passive \n  eavesdropping,\n</code></pre>\nYou should never assume that &#x27;eavesdropping&#x27; is passive. In almost every practical context of traffic interception, if you can read the transmission, you can write as well. If you&#x27;re going to the trouble of installing some kind of tap, it makes more sense to make it read-write so you can actually <i>do</i> something with that intercepted connection. Collecting data is great, but hijacking is even better.<p><pre><code>  and also provides you much better integrity protection for your data than raw\n  TCP does when dealing with random network noise\n</code></pre>\nThis is a red herring, and if you need <i>real integrity</i> is totally useless since it doesn&#x27;t prevent an active attacker from corrupting the data once they&#x27;ve hijacked your unauthenticated connection. For the majority of plaintext traffic, a small amount of corruption is way more efficient to allow for than breaking down and re-creating a connection every time a single bit gets flipped.<p>To use OE, you have to set up an SSL service in the first place, so just take the extra 15 minutes and make a real signed certificate. There is no such thing as &quot;kind of&quot; secure, after all. Encryption is intended to provide security. OE is not secure.",1427486330

A plant can contain multiple units; the biggest coal fired plant is in Taiwan, with 10 units totaling about 5GW.  Most big power plant units today are in the 500MW - 1GW size. Smaller, and you need too many with a lot of duplicate equipment; bigger, and the turbines become too massive.<p>It took the US about 10 years after the Clean Air Act to clean up air pollution in major industrial cities. London once had air quality problems comparable to Beijing. Pittsburgh and Cleveland were almost as bad. China has the advantage that the technology is known and most of their cars already have good emission controls.  The current situation in China coal plants seems to be that most of them have electrostatic precipitators to remove the big particles, but not bag houses (giant buildings full of filters) to remove the small particles.  Then there&#x27;s NOx and SO2 removal.  The pollution control facilities for a big coal plant are bigger than the power production facilities.<p>Here&#x27;s an overview from Power Magazine on the subject.[1]<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.powermag.com/chinas-war-on-air-pollution/?printmode=1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.powermag.com/chinas-war-on-air-pollution/?printmo...</a>",1427485781

9278584,comment,9276441,9278140,0,0,jjoonathan,,,"No, I&#x27;m asking about off-die SRAM as a replacement for off-die DRAM, not on-die DRAM as an alternative to {off die DRAM, cache, cores, etc}. There are a bunch of tradeoffs to be made on-die, and I get the reasoning behind them even if I don&#x27;t know specific numbers. X86 has to enforce permissions, handle sharing, cross-reference a TLB, etc and you can win significantly by memorizing results subject to statistically unlikely invalidation. There would be separate L1/L2/L3 even if all SRAM cells had identical latency and density. Which they might, I don&#x27;t know. L4 (eDRAM, what you were talking about) gives you a huge density advantage, but it&#x27;s still not competitive with SRAM for speed, even though it&#x27;s on the same process:<p><a href=""http://www.sisoftware.co.uk/?d=qa&f=mem_hsw"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sisoftware.co.uk/?d=qa&f=mem_hsw</a><p><pre><code>    L1:     4 clocks  <-- SRAM\n    L2:    12 clocks  <-- SRAM\n    L3:    36 clocks  <-- SRAM\n    L4:   136 clocks (55ns) <-- eDRAM\n    DRAM: 193 clocks (80ns) <-- off-die DRAM\n    Clock: 2.5GHz (dynamic overclocking was disabled)\n    5cm travel: 1 clock\n</code></pre>\nWith SRAM you just have to open the right gate, whereas with DRAM you have to precharge the bitlines, open the word line, wait for the tiny signal to amplify up to logic level, and only then do you get to read it out. Worse, you need tons of logic to re-order memory access to take advantage of multiple accesses on the same word line or that can happen simultaneously in different banks. And you need to refresh each word line periodically, which requires even more logic. There is a reason why the memory controller (not the cache, the controller) is a huge chunk of the die roughly the size of 2 cores!<p>If we assume that L3 and L4 have similar management overhead then this all takes ~100 clock cycles in the comparison above, which dominates the other costs even if we disregard savings due to simpler logic in off-die SRAM (which, when combined with travel time, accounts for 60 cycles).<p>I still don&#x27;t understand why off-die SRAM isn&#x27;t sensible.",1427485561

9278520,comment,9278268,9278268,0,0,api,,,"Depends on the database. In most cases it means someone got into the internal backplane network and then accessed the database. Sometimes that requires no authentication at all since people very falsely assume firewalled equals secure.<p>Google &quot;firewalking&quot; for more sophisticated attacks against firewalls, but usually a firewall can be breached via malware, phishing, specially crafted web apps, XSS, etc. In general firewalls should be considered weak and only a first line of defense. Far, far too much emphasis is placed on them at the expense of host and app level security -- the &quot;soft underbelly problem.&quot;<p>My personal and admittedly slightly fringe opinion is that you should harden your apps, servers, and endpoint devices first and your network last. Assume there is no firewall at all. Would your box be secure if it were just naked on the Internet? If not, it&#x27;s not secure.<p>Here&#x27;s what I&#x27;d recommend:<p>- Databases should always use local DB-level authentication. It&#x27;s become trendy of late to dispense with this. Some newer DBs I&#x27;ve seen don&#x27;t even support it, which is really stupid.<p>- Keep DB passwords out of world-readable files, command lines visible to &#x27;ps&#x27;, and code repos!<p>- The database should only bind to the backplane network device, not to 0.0.0.0 or ::0. Or if it&#x27;s for local use only, use unix domain sockets or bind to 127.0.0.1 or ::1.<p>- There are some interesting local iptables rules you can use to control e.g. which <i>users</i> on a system are allowed to open sockets. These can be valuable for loopback/localhost database access control as another layer of security.<p>- Consider using VMs and/or containerization to separate concerns, though this is not a panacea. Sometimes multiplying complexity and system count this way actually makes it harder to defend your overall system, and of course you&#x27;re f&#x27;d if someone pwns the physical host. A bunch of isolated virtual machines can also mean a lot of nooks and crannies where an attacker can set up shop inside your network and hide out. I&#x27;ve heard un-policed systems/VMs like this termed &quot;crack houses.&quot;<p>- Be very careful with backups. Sometimes people can compromise backups instead of compromising your actual systems. Encryption is a good idea.<p>- The meat sack between the chair and the keyboard is usually one of the weakest links in system security. Beware of phishing attacks, social engineering, and copy/pasting untrusted code off the net. The latter has become a popular attack of late, especially given what can be done with unicode and other weird tricks to hide stuff in innocent looking text. There&#x27;s also been cases where underhanded backdoors have been smuggled into organizations via cooperative coding vectors like StackOverflow. Others include just &#x27;docker pull&#x27;ing any old Docker project off Docker Hub without regard of what goodies may be hiding inside.",1427484667

And that some people don&#x27;t do it, or can&#x27;t afford it, regardless of its legality (see: alcohol)?<p>I didn&#x27;t say all, I said &quot;most&quot; of the problem with drugs is that they are illegal.<p>The problem is that the current system does absolutely nothing to combat the problems both you and I mention. It is a huge waste of money, time, life and resources. Sticking addicts who need treatment in jail does nothing to solve the problem.<p>Legalization, harm-reduction and proper education seems to be the way to go. Current &quot;abstinence-only&quot; drug education simply doesn&#x27;t cut it. Informing users about both the risks and benefits of drug use in an unbiased, non-judgemental way would be much more effective.<p>All this doesn&#x27;t even take into account the philosophical argument that an adult should be free to put whatever they want into their own bodies. You can&#x27;t stop people from making poor life decisions.",1427483936

In the latter, he did allow for the fact that chaos theory meant that the psychohistorians couldn&#x27;t predict <i>small</i> outcomes, but that they could certainly predict <i>big</i> ones.  In both of those, the authors were enjoying a fantasy that you could plug in some key inputs, put up with a ton of variation, but still get the general output that you originally planned for.  And then closer to home, there&#x27;s public policy planning or even bigger planning like the introduction of the Euro.<p>Is that true in chaos theory though?  Are there mathematical ways to create and predict dynamic systems with behavior that is truly bound within certain parameters?",1427483205

Lots and lots of people want to live in a highly authoritarian society and it&#x27;s worth reflecting on why that is, and whether those people have valid reasons.&quot;<p>This is a really salient point and one that comes off as heresy to the standard conspiracy-esque narrative. The reality is that to some extent our slide into authoritarianism is <i>democratic</i>.<p>Look at the &quot;Arab Spring&quot; -- they got a little democracy and mostly elected totalitarian theocrats. In that case many people want totalitarian enforcement of social norms.<p>Another place you can see a strong preference for authoritarianism is at a local community level. Many people prefer communities with strong zoning regulations, regulations on the appearance of buildings, and (often indirect) mechanisms for excluding &#x27;undesirable&#x27; residents. Without those things you get sprawling, ugly, and sometimes crime-ridden places that just don&#x27;t feel safe and are not aesthetically appealing.<p>Yet another is the clear preference many people have for authoritarian computing platforms like iOS. It&#x27;s the most restricted platform in the history of computing, yet it offers superior user experience and a lack of malware precisely for that reason. The fact is that there&#x27;s classes of problems that can be easily and simply solved by authoritarianism that are not easily addressed in a freer society.",1427483193

It&#x27;s undeniably true <i>if</i> everyone is in the same building but in my experience this is rarely actually true as people need to work from home, use mobile devices, other offices open, partnerships or acquisitions happen, etc. That tends to lead to people requesting holes in firewalls or using VPNs as a sort of aftermarket spray-on security measure, which inevitably makes things much worse because now you have exposed services[1] which were setup and operated by people whose threat-model was “Sheltered internal service accessed by trusted staff”. It&#x27;s much better to start with the assumption that your services are exposed to the internet and secure them accordingly.<p>1. VPNs are almost always terrible for security because people tend to get them for one need (i.e. email, one line of business app, etc.) but when their computer gets compromised the attacker now has access to the superset of everything which every VPN user has ever needed to access and in all likelihood a bunch of other things which were never intended to be exposed but were never adequately firewalled internally.",1427483152

(Let&#x27;s assume the pepper is an AES key which all hashes are encrypted with.)<p>Yes, many times a dedicated attacker who has read access to your database will also have read access to your source code or config files, but many times they won&#x27;t. And if they don&#x27;t, then they won&#x27;t be able to crack a single one of your passwords, while even with a modern and proper hashing algorithm they still may be able to crack passwords.<p>Take the scenario of a relatively intelligent hacking or hacktivist group, of which there&#x27;ve been several in the past 5 years. Let&#x27;s say they&#x27;re targeting someone they dislike for whatever reason, and find out that person is registered on some forum and decide to compromise the forum. (This tactic of lifting a whole haystack to find a single needle is very common for motivated attackers.)

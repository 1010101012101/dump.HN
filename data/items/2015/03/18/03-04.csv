I think what you&#x27;re seeing is more an issue of questioning the specific assumptions that prevent the question from springing to mind, than it is knowing how to answer questions by searching the internet. Remember that their low-income parents and public school are probably doing very little or nothing to guide them through the applications process, and quite likely not even much to grok the sort of cultures where you have selection processes that require a lot of effort and domain knowledge, in general.<p>This is a non-trivial case of jootsing if you aren&#x27;t already immersed in a culture that brings you most of the way to asking the question. It&#x27;s a serious test of reflective intelligence, unlike SATs and acquiring grades and conforming to the college admissions process which are pretty much all about algorithmic intelligence (using Stanovich&#x27;s terminology).",1426651170

I knew this was obvious enough of an idea that other people would have had it, and potentially taken it further.<p>One of my longer-term thoughts on this approach is that it may extend beyond simply a &quot;controller&quot; notion.  Ultimately, I was thinking the phone could become the sole state carrier, and all other devices (workstations, laptops, game consoles, projectors) could become stateless endpoints which are ephemerally controlled as needed.<p>For example, you could arrive at home, connect your phone to your home computer, and initiate a &quot;home session&quot; which kicks off all the &#x27;webapps&#x27; you have defined for your home-computer environment, on your home computer.  The apps are structured client/server, and they save their state back to the phone (but use the computer&#x27;s processing, display, audio, etc.).  When you&#x27;re done, you disconnect and leave.  All your state is saved to your phone, and any other computer you come across can temporarily become your &quot;home computer&quot;.<p>Likewise, any computer can be your &quot;work computer&quot;.  And any game console can be &quot;your&quot; game console.<p>The phone, in this context, seems like the ultimate proxy for the individual.  It travels with a person.  It has access to the inputs and data in the vincinity of the individual.  It can be controlled by the individual.  What better place to put all of your computational state, than in there?<p>Anyway, this was some far-fetched, pie-in-the-sky thinking I had about the long-term implications of such an architecture.<p>Happy to see other people working on the concept.",1426651018

9223480,comment,9219432,9221420,0,0,e12e,,,"> The fixation on private keys puzzles me.<p>Really? The private key in asymmetric cryptography should never/is assumed to <i>never</i> be known to anyone other than the key-holder. Session keys are understood to be shared, and so are by definition not secure (equivalently, I can log my part of the &quot;conversation&quot; with a server, even if over TLS with PFS). So session keys, session cookies, transmitted data -- is <i>always</i> known by more than one party, a secret key should <i>never</i> be known by more than one party.<p>It is true that most TLS server deployments don&#x27;t enforce this -- they don&#x27;t do the asymmetric operations in a trusted computing module, smart card etc -- but they <i>should</i>. They <i>shouldn&#x27;t</i> store the key in ram, but they currently do.<p>If you get the secret key, you can do many more things than merely intercept traffic. You can impersonate and fake traffic (fake evidence).<p>In addition to all this, being able to read arbitrary memory controlled by the same process is also worse than being able to read stuff that is already being transmitted. This isn&#x27;t strictly a Rust/other language issue (I imagine, but do not know, that one eg could sanely (if foolishly) share buffers across thread pools, and so potentially leak information across clients -- this would probably be a design error wrt. trust boundaries etc ... but no-one is arguing that any language can prevent design errors).<p>As mentioned in other comments, privilege separation (a la openssh etc) is a great way to help leverage the os/kernel in order to enforce assumptions about the security primitives used.

I&#x27;m just curious what resolution the scanner/recognizer pattern is at.<p>I&#x27;m assuming Apple uses some kind of capacitive sensor. From googling it looks like it&#x27;s a 500ppi sensor. The sensor isn&#x27;t even 1&quot;x1&quot;, it&#x27;s <i>maybe</i> 1/2&quot;^2.

That&#x27;s still a huge number (753 digits).<p>But then maybe you can apply some smart guesses or some reverse engineering and concentrate patterns in the middle of the sensor (where good contact might be made), maybe down to a 1/32&quot; section.

However, I think I have a potential solution, which I&#x27;ll work on this weekend.<p>The solution is: on the client side, include an optional encrypting tar filter, which takes a tar file as input, and encrypts the file contents of each file within the archive, delivering a tar file output with regular headers, but compressed encrypted files.  I&#x27;ll probably have to take some liberties with the tar file format, but as long as the snebu backend is similarly modified (to recognize a pre-compressed and encrypted file segment), then I should be able to get it to work without any major compromises.<p>The only issues with my current plan are: 1) Multiple files with the same contents will still be de-duplicated, which may leak some information (if an attacker already knows file A&#x27;s contents, and B is marked as being a copy of A, then the attacker will know what file B is).  2) The metadata (file name, size, owner, possibly SHA1) will still be visible.

A Teletype keyboard is a motor-driven mechanism where, when you push a key, a clutch is released, a shaft revolves one turn, and, via levers and cams, contacts close and open and the bits are encoded and sent.  During this time, which is about 200ms on the older machines, you cannot press another key - the keys won&#x27;t move. You can&#x27;t press two keys at once.  Everything is mechanically interlocked.  The best way to use one is to type at a steady 5 characters per second, like playing a piano.<p>Key travel is about half an inch, and the newer (1930 and later) models have spring-loaded green keytops with a nice cushioned spring mechanism.  This provides about 0.100 inch of travel before the key lever starts to move. So if you type a little too fast, you don&#x27;t blunt your fingers.  The 1924 model doesn&#x27;t have that; it has hard Underwood typewriter keys.<p>That huge key travel, combined with a low key pressure (the motor is doing all the work, unlike a manual typewriter) is rather relaxing.  Teletype operators were expected to type with few errors; there is no way to backspace or correct.   Full-time Western Union operators often typed &quot;blind&quot; on a machine with a keyboard and tape punch, but no printer or display.  That&#x27;s a lost art today.",1426647923

The combination of those things makes it a significant advance over what we had to work with before, in my mind.<p>> My brief experience at Coverity makes me guess that you could be getting rid of one class of bugs without necessarily improving the product in any noticeable way...that ya, those bugs were common but not particularly easy to exploit or hard to fix once found.<p>It is true that exploitation of UAF (for example) is not within the skill level of most programmers and that individual UAFs are easy to fix. But &quot;hard for most programmers to exploit and easy to fix&quot; doesn&#x27;t seem to be much of a mitigation. For example, the Rails YAML vulnerability was <i>also</i> hard to exploit (requiring knowledge of Ruby serialization internals and vulnerable standard library constructors) and easy to fix (just disable YAML), but it was rightly considered a fire-drill operation across Web sites the world over. The &quot;smart cow&quot; phenomenon ensures that vulnerabilities that start out difficult to exploit become easy to exploit when packaged up into scripts, if the incentives are there to do so. Exploitable use-after-free vulnerabilities in network-facing apps are like the Rails YAML vulnerabilities: &quot;game-over&quot; RCEs (possibly when combined with sandbox escapes).",1426647810

5378397,comment,5378008,5378334,2,0,windexh8er,,,"I think your first paragraph would likely be relegated to spin. While your oversimplification of the problem makes it seem acutely cut and dry the short response is: it's not that simple.<p>Like all other constraints of life in general, I think going lax on things like a separation of an ill corporation and the direct corollary effect it poses to something nature has originally derived is treading in unknown territory.  The fact that this simple question would have been laughable at best 15 years ago showcases the downward spiral into everything being a legal matter in the not so distant future. You may think this is counterproductive activism but skim the history books. Look around you and reflect on the choices that others have made to put your in your first world situation. That can quickly change if there aren't people who keep those ideals in check and balance out the corporate tendencies that often times spins out of control when left to its own device. That is a path where morals take a back seat to suits and dollars more often than not.",1363305588

I don't know that there aren't crazy patent trolls out there suing gardeners, but as far as Monsanto is concerned, I don't think gardeners have much to worry about.<p>If you read the Monsanto suits that have been published, the behavior Monsanto pursues is planting unlicensed Roundup-Ready seeds and then spraying them with glyphosphate-based (""Roundup"") herbicides. You can spray Roundup without a patent license. You can probably plant RR crops without a license. But if you do both (commercially, at least), Monsanto sues.<p>The point of RR seeds is that they resist Roundup, which is a broad-spectrum herbicide that will kill non-RR crops. In the commercial suits, it becomes tricky to argue that you planted RR crops unwittingly when you are later shown to have sprayed them with an herbicide that would have certainly ruined your harvest but for inbred RR resistance.<p>The patent they have on the whole RR system may be totally invalid; I'm hoping to have the presence of mind not to end up litigating that point.

But practically this usually happens with placing the tools outside the jurisdiction of DMCA. For example repositories that host libdvdcss are located outside US, since the whole purpose of libdvdcss is to remove DRM from DVDs to enable playing them in open source players (which is naturally 100% fair use - i.e. to view the legally purchased content). And it is widely used - all Linux users basically use it to watch their DVDs.<p>The level of ""mainstream"" penetration of such tools will depend on the level of DRM penetration. The more DRM will be pushed on people, the more commonplace the circumvention tools will become. In practice however the developing trend tends to be to use less DRM in various areas, so circumvention tools are kind of not very widespread either.",1363304758

5378334,comment,5378008,5378125,5,0,Lazare,,,"Short answer:  No.<p>Long answer:  The question is sparked by a recent court case where a farmer - named Bowman - purposefully used unlicensed technology on a commercial scale.  If you are doing it by accident, or aren't doing it on a commercial scale, you're perfectly safe.  (Some reporting in the popular press makes it sound like Bowman was unaware of his infringement or that it was an accident - a lot of people are freaking out at the idea of Monsanto suing a farmer because some patented seeds happened to be found on his property.  If you read the court case, it becomes clear that nothing of the kind happened, and that if it had the case would have been thrown out.)<p>Really, it's just like every other bit of patented tech.  If you're operating a factory pumping out unlicensed Rolex watches, you've got some potential legal liability.  If you bought a fake watch in Bangkok, you don't.  While I personally have some very serious qualms about the patents on GM crops, the current legal situation is, honestly, pretty sane.  Hobbyists are perfectly safe, as are farmers acting in good faith (ie, they plant seeds believing them to be unpatented, or their seeds are contaminated by patented seeds blown across their property line).  Activists like to construct scary hypotheticals, but the truth is rather more prosaic.",1363304619
5378333,comment,5359406,5378015,1,0,mindslight,,,"> <i>Bitcoin may do this, but it does so by sacrificing rigorous security and offline payments</i><p>Both seem like definite hard tradeoffs to me. Offline transactions imply there is some ultimate real-world identity that can be punished for fraud. By ""sacrificing rigorous security"", I assume you're referring to the majority of CPU power controlling the network. If we give up having a central authority and verified identities, we necessitate <i>some</i> measure of ""majority of power"" in the system (although it doesn't necessarily have to be CPU).<p>> <i>a system built from secure cryptographic primitives can still fail to meet its security goal</i><p>Sure, but one <i>can</i> formalize the properties of Bitcoin, and could prove that it indeed meets those properties.<p>One of these properties is ""network is controlled by the majority of computing power"". I'm not saying this is a universal good thing or ultimate solution. What I am saying is that this property is what provides independence from a central authority, which is possibly what has enabled Bitcoin to actually be adopted.<p>> <i>Parties are not created by authorities; parties are what communicate in a distributed system</i><p>No, ""parties"" are a convenient abstraction for distributed systems papers in that they bound the pervasiveness of an attacker. The reader intuitively understands them as some notion of identity (IP address, digital certificate, etc), but here we have no luxury. As you later touch upon, once you get rid of identities, a single attacker can create an unlimited number of parties.<p>I think general MPC has only been proved secure if a majority of parties are honest. Bitcoin is substituting 'parties' with computing power, for precisely the reason you describe. Would we say MPC is insecure because the effort required to attack it (number of malicious parties to establish) is linear in the size of the system (total number of parties)?<p>I understand this isn't the best security guarantee, but you seem to be having an allergic reaction to it. Complexity theoretic guarantees are useful <i>because</i> they work. However, most real-world power balances are close to linear.<p>I guess my main point has been that Bitcoin provides a property (authority-independence) that previous ecash papers have not. Its guarantees of this aren't the strongest, but if we're to improve it we must recognize the problem it's solving.<p>Maybe there's another way of implementing authority-independence that doesn't succumb to something as simplistic as computing power. As it is, it seems that Bitcoin will continue to centralize as miners further specialize and the requirements to be ""on the network"" (versus transacting through an agent) grow.",1363304613

I have a minor quibble that <i>can't adapt</i> ought to actually read <i>find it difficult to adapt</i> for the very reasons specified--it's not a matter of <i>can</i> or <i>cannot</i>, but a reflection of how much time one is actually able to invest in learning, like a human language.

So some objects were truly still and some objects were truly moving.<p>The Higgs field also permeates all objects, but the mathematical structure is different and it has no preferred frame, so there is no truly still object, all the movements are relative.<p>This is not a strange thing. The photons are the bosons of the electromagnetic field, that also permeates all objects and it has no preferred frame, so there is no truly still object, all the movements are relative.<p>And the gluons are the bosons of the strong force field with exactly the same properties.<p>Even the electrons have and associated field that that also permeates all objects and it has no preferred frame, so there is no truly still object, all the movements are relative. But electrons are fermions, no bosons, so some properties are different, but they have an associated field.<p>The same happens with the up and down quarks (and neutrinos). Each one has a associated field, with the same properties. (And the other particles too, but this is becoming too repetitive.)<p>The strange thing is not that the Higgs Bosons have an associated field. The strange thing is that the vacuum expectation value of the Higgs Fields is not zero.<p>In all the other cases (photons, electrons, ...) the vacuum expectation value is zero, so if you have an empty box, there are almost no particles there (some virtual particles appear, but in some sense they are only a few, (in another sense they are a lot, but it's better to think that they are only a few).) The important thing is that if any particle pass through the box, it will almost not bounce against any other particle (photons, electrons, ...) because it is empty.<p>But for the Higgs fields the vacuum expectation value is not zero! So even inside the empty box the value of the Higgs field is not zero, there is something like a background value. If any particle passes through the box, it will bounce many many many times against the background even if the box is empty. An easy way to interpret all this bouncing is to say that the particle has apparent mass.<p>But the Higgs field is not even, it has bumps, and those bumps are the Higgs Bosons. The empty box has only very few Higgs Bosons (or a lot in another technical sense). The normal particles can bounce against the background (vacuum expectation value) and we call it ""mass"" and they can also bounce against the bumps (bosons) and we call it ""interactions"".",1363304154

During and after high-school I worked as a web dev for a small compnay and did some projects on the side. At the time the only college degree you could go for was a ""Diplom"", which is a 5 year program and qualifies you for PhD studies - or just keep working and making very good money at the time.<p>After having done web development - I'm talking front-end stuff here: HTML, JavaScript, CSS and simple business logic stuff with ColdFusion/Perl/PHP and MySQL - I wanted to move on to more interesting things. And that's what the degree allowed me to do. I qualified the kind of web development I did, because there are some very interesting fields on the server side when it comes to scaling things, but I can see how the front-end technologies get boring.<p>It certainly depends on what courses you are going to take. But if your aim is to get a deeper understanding of more complex problems, I suggest you go for it and apply that rule to the courses you are going to take. Personally I did mainly machine learning and compilers and worked at the chair for distributed systems.<p>So what has this gotten me? Well, that depends on the way you look at it, but together with my co-founder I'm working on a startup that analyzes location information and motion detection to track user behavior.

Incanter has a much better implementation called $= with less gotchas and many more features:<p><pre><code>  (defmacro arith [& args]\n      (letfn [(res [v] \n                (cond \n                 (vector? v) (apply arith-body v)\n                 (list? v) (map res v)\n                 :else v))\n              (arith-body [s & args] \n                (reduce (fn ([expr] expr) ([expr [op arg]] `(~op ~expr ~(res arg))))\n                        (res s) \n                        (partition 2 args)))]\n        (apply arith-body args)))\n \n    (defn deriv [f]\n      (let [dx 0.001]\n        (fn [x] (arith \n          (f [x + dx]) - (f x) / dx))))\n\n    ((deriv (fn [x] (arith x * x))) 3)\n</code></pre>\nAnother common problem is the piping of results from one function to the next:<p><pre><code>     (f \n       (g \n          (h a)))\n</code></pre>\nwhere you usually want to start reading the code in the lower rightmost corner and go upwards towards the left. Very messy in many lisps.<p>Clojure has solved that problem with the threading macros, yielding postfix notation when you need it the most:<p><pre><code>    (-> a h g f)\n</code></pre>\nPiping subresults between functions really doesn't get much better in any language.<p>And that's of course some of the appeal of Lisp: The syntax may start controversial, but you can choose most of it yourself and make it depend on the problem, your tastes and of course, your readers.",1363302333

5378200,comment,5378184,5378184,1,0,shmerl,,,"OK, probably it's better to rephrase the question, since copyright law and fair use concept predate DMCA. Why DMCA didn't include provisions of being not applicable in cases of fair use from the copyright law perspective?<p>The point of fair use is obvious - to limit copyright restrictions for sensible use cases (like personal use, accessibility and so on). Comes along DMCA and claims that cases covered by fair use are illegal. Was it the intention all along, or it was a sneaky way to do it? Can't DMCA be challenged on this grounds as being invalid as is?",1363302290

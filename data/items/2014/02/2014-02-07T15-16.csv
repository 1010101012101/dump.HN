You may be surprised to realize just how lacking in radicalism any sustainable political systems are. US style liberal democracy wasn&#x27;t a large departure from UK style parliamentary democracy. The president is modeled on the King, the Senate on the House of Lords and the House of Representatives on the House of Commons. Slowly over time the Senate and the Presidency were made more directly democratic. Our system of common law has a continuous chain of statements going back to England for many hundreds of years. Capitalism was going on for hundreds of years before it was described by Adam Smith.<p>You know what always fails? When a group of nitwits gets together and decides they&#x27;ve got it all figured out and then submit the rest of society to their hair-brained ideas. In the last 100 years engineers have have played a large role in a number. See: Franco, Pinochet, Mussolini.<p>So yeah, expect a lot of vitriol from students of history when some engineers start getting really excited about playing the role of political radical.<p>The meritocracy the SV loves so much is basically a nightmare when applied to society st large. You&#x27;ll have designed a system by and for computer engineers with the premise that all of the unwashed masses will either have to sink or swim in your newly founded utopia system. You&#x27;re going to fuck it up and along with that you&#x27;re going to fuck up millions of lives.<p>Are there any fucking adults on this forum any more? Do your parents know where you are?

I agree with that. I can also add that the countries where the democratic principles developed slowly and organically (US and Britain) happen to be rich (strong economy is a condition where people can start to think about democracy and human rights, poor economy is where people think about basic security) and it was these countries that induced the democratic changes in other countries (e.g., post-WW2 Germany), using their wealth to stabilize their economies, and eventually transplanting their own democratic traditions to these new countries.<p>So this works fine as long as the revolution-inducing country is rich enough to sponsor the economy of the country where the revolution is taking place. In addition to economy, there are other factors, such cultural norms (e.g., family clans), that will need to be overcome, but this worked as long as the cultures are not too different (US and Germany, or Western Europe and Central Europe, for example).<p>So basically, we seem to agree that Western-style democracy is not something that can now be organically implanted in Ukraine, not without massive amounts of money poured into it by the West (which is problematic given the size of the country), and even then this will be difficult because of huge differences in traditions to run a country.",1391788485

7196788,comment,7193554,7193554,1,0,soneca,,,"An important tip missing on the OP is: be persistent, fully knowing that you might be annoying, but never, under any circunstance admit that you are annoying, or act as you knew you were being annoying. You must sound totally naivee, act as all you want is your prospect to better and completely convinced that using your product would make him a better person/professional. Act surprised when the prospect act irritated. And always use the argument that the prospect himself kept that door open with you by not saying he didn&#x27;t want your product.<p>This was a great read to me, because now I know that I&#x27;ve been doing it right for the last few years. Before my &quot;2013 startup year&quot; I worked on a philanthropy advisory non-profit. 80% of my job was <i>selling</i> to wealthy individuals our service of being a guide to better donations. So I was basically a salesperson selling a service that almost nobody in Brazil consider a real need or problem  - btw that&#x27;s one difference between cause driven non-profits and market driven startups, you don&#x27;t pivot if the market doesn&#x27;t need your service, you persist. Mainly because the people you are solving a problem and the people giving you money are two separate stakeholders usually. That&#x27;s kind of inevitable, because the social problem wouldn&#x27;t be there to begin with if the market/society were really bothered by it. I can&#x27;t imagine Watsi pivoting because people do not want to pay for medical anymore, but they would be willing to pay for a exotic tourism service to where the people they aid are from. They might get more money this way, but social tourism is another cause, solves another problem (maybe). It is not an acceptable pivot for a non-profit.<p>Back on topic, I learned to be persistent to get to a no. People hate saying no to something that the society consider the right thing to do, even if they have no intention of actually doing it, so this was crutial to my job - get a &quot;no&quot; was always my objective.<p>But I disagree with a reason to do it is getting feedback. I never got real feedback for why people were saying no - maybe because of what I was selling, there is a stigma in saying <i>&quot;I won&#x27;t donate because I earned it by myself and I am antitled to spend on whatever I want, and giving them away to other people&#x27;s benefit is not my idea of a money well spent&quot;</i>.",1391788384

They&#x27;re not.<p>The EU can issue Directive, that laws that represent the strict minimum to comply. Then the individual state has to actually pass a national law that implements the directive.<p>Three options here. The state does not want to implement the law and get fined. The state implements the law following closely the Directive. Or it can go further than the directive, like, in the case of the French privacy law, add more requirements.<p>Our system as flaws but I&#x27;m not to kind on Google messing around it. It could very well set an unfortunate precedent. EU Directive are sometimes quite weak so it would be a problem to me that instead of representing the min they end up representing the max requirement.<p>Google is suing because they want EU to invalidate the French law. But I don&#x27;t see how it could happen since AFAIK the French privacy laws predate the Directive by a quite large amount. Right now I think EU can only overrule a state law if it does not offer minimal citizen protection or if there are contradictions with the Directive. Not if they offer more protection.<p>As for a treaty allowing US corps to invalid EU Directives ... well, good for you but we still have national laws. I don&#x27;t see how the invalidation of a Directive would invalidate automatically national law.<p>I might be wrong though.

Being an accredited investor or early employee in a successful company dramatically lowers the pool of potential candidates to strike it rich.<p>You could still make a really nice return post-IPO, but it means you need a certain minimum amount of wealth you can risk investing to begin with (i.e. being able to access say, $100k or $1m and hope for a 10x return. This implies you are already upper-middle class or wealthier). I made up figures here so that the return would be life changing for most people. You could hope to turn $1000 into $10k but it wouldn&#x27;t be that life changing for many people.

Here&#x27;s my quick thoughts.  iOS has caught up in a lot of the features it was missing early on (multi-tasking) but it still lacks widgets.  It may not be for everyone, but I use two widgets on my desktop daily and Apple&#x27;s answer to it in the notification center is bleh.  I originally liked Apple&#x27;s Passbook but Google&#x27;s Wallet and Now surpass it in features and in some ways usability.  By this I mean Google automatically creates cards for my packages from UPS without any effort for me at all.  It also keeps track of my boarding passes, tickets, etc with no effort.  Apple&#x27;s solution requires (generally) that I open an e-mail attachment or something.  Last but not least are the Google Apps, most notably Maps but it does include the others.  iOS is made better by Google software and most iOS users I know use one or more Google apps.  In a full Google platform though the integration is superior.  Let&#x27;s say I&#x27;m sitting at my desktop and search for a restaurant.

These were only available to the public within the last decade or so.<p>TL;DR: RFK was far more hawkish and pro-air strikes/invasion than he later portrayed himself. There was no brilliant gambit to &quot;accept&quot; Khrushchev&#x27;s earlier offer in place of his later one: The trade of the Jupiter missiles in Turkey was viewed as an acceptable way out by JFK essentially as soon as it was proposed. President Kennedy actually comes off rather well, without over-committing to military engagement early in the crisis and by managing the post-blockade diplomatic dance while avoiding avenues of potential escalation.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Cuban-Missile-Crisis-American-Memory/dp/0804783772"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Cuban-Missile-Crisis-American-Memory/d...</a>",1391785333

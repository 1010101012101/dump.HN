45506,story,,,4,4,dfranke,"Generalizing Palish's question: how would you fix high school?",,"There was a lot of disagreement over whether Palish's ""hacker schools"" could be viable, but I think most of here agree that high school in its current form is horribly broken.  So, what would you do to make it less miserable, particularly for hackers but also in general?<p>Don't cop out by just saying ""hand out vouchers (or abolish public schooling) and let the free market take care of it"".  If you believe that's the right first step, then go on suppose that you're the headmaster of a private high school.  What will it look like?",1187847704

45502,comment,45424,45424,0,0,mwerty,,,"IMHO, reddit can do the following to clean up:<p>1. make my.reddit.com the default and make it harder to get to the current default front page.<p>\n2. This was a while back so they may have fixed this already: Don't screw up on the cookie/log in process - I've had to log in several times to reddit despite not logging out. I finally stopped logging in. Their ip logs probably tell the story better and can validate my experience. Its a small bug and takes a while to realize the full impact on user experience. The auto-login is sacred for a site like reddit.<p>\n3. Work really hard on the recommendation engine for comments as well.",1187846958

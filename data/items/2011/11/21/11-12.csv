Devices like smartphones and tablets have great unique uses, like people in other comments are saying, so I'm not suggesting you ban kids from using them or anything.<p>But I maintain books have far more physical qualities than any tablet or e-reader. Variety, for starters. Tabs and e-readers all come in some shade of black or gray, they all present a very similar glass texture to the touch, and they only have that new gadget smell for two days. On the other hand, very few books are the same. Moving from a magazine to a hardcover to a paperback may be all the same for you and me, but for a 6 year old is an extremely important feast of sensations that informs her developing mind about the myriad materials and textures and smells the world is made of.<p>Why rob a child of that variety?",1321876670

This is so wrong I am surprised somebody went as far as to write an article about this, someone should just tell the Sunday Times guy to maybe do his homework next time he utters some sentences to thousands of people. Turing had more in common with Newton or Einstein (I think the mental leaps he did for example in his work on the Entscheidungs problem are almost of this order, even though again the abstract nature of his work make its applications and implications narrower and harder to see), then with Henry Ford or Thomas Edison.",1321876178

Assuming those parameters stay the same, the breakeven point for cost equivalence between Delta and SpaceX is about a 75% success rate for SpaceX. But while the payload may ""cost"" a billion, losing it obviously incurs some added opportunity cost, eg lost capabilities that you otherwise would have had, had it not exploded. If you increase the payload cost to 1.5 billion, SpaceX needs to achieve a success rate of about 81% to <i>equal</i> the price of a Delta.<p>Sources: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Thor_and_Delta_launches_(2010%E2%80%932019)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Thor_and_Delta_launches...</a>\n<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX</a>",1321875451

3260769,comment,3260203,3260582,3,0,dhx,,,"Anti-virus software is not necessary. It's a side effect of poor system configuration, slow release cycles for patched software and to a lesser extent, poorly designed software.<p>If a severe vulnerability is discovered, open source communities race to distribute a new version of the software (faster than anti-virus vendors can respond). Package management allows patches for _all_ software to be rolled out quickly and securely. A turnaround time exceeding 2 hours from knowledge of a critical vulnerability to patched software being distributed to 1,000,000's of computers would be considered slow. The concept of executing files downloaded from Internet sites, provided on removable media or sent via email is completely foreign.<p>Proprietary vendors tend to follow the processes defined in their ISO 9001 compliant Quality Management System. They wait for the next weekly ""Urgent"" Security Working Group Meeting so that a proposal to develop a Software Change Request can be agreed upon. ... blah blah... 2 months later you _may_ have updated software that users won't know about because they don't check the sites of the 100's of applications on their computers on a daily schedule.<p>Microsoft _could_ do more, particularly with respect to system-wide package management. However, _proprietary software vendors_ are the primary culprits. Microsoft can't help Windows users if software vendors refuse to respond to security vulnerabilities quickly or fail to design their software with consideration towards security.<p>I wish I saved the reference, but I read an interview recently where the founder/CEO of a prominent anti-virus vendor stated bluntly that the only reason the business exists is because of a failure to address {a list of well known and ignored problems including some I mentioned above}. Marcus Ranum (""inventor of the firewall"")[1], Linus Torvalds[2] and many other well known and greatly respected researchers/practitioners have views on the computer security industry that may appear surprising. These people have significant influence, decades of experience and the respect to back it up. The comments they have towards the industry, including anti-virus vendors, are often quite negative (while remaining constructive). There is a reason founders of anti-virus companies can make discouraging remarks about the need for their company to exist -- they know from vast experience that software vendors won't be listening.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.ranum.com/security/computer_security/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ranum.com/security/computer_security/</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/706950"" rel=""nofollow"">http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/706950</a>",1321875375

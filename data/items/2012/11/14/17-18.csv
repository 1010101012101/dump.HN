We need him to do client-side web development, specifically for presenting multimedia for online language learning. Incidentally, it's also a student job- my guy has taken one formal programming course, and this is his first real job experience.<p>There are many levels of things that I need him to learn. Some of them are ""can you actually write code?"" issues. If you've previously done Web Dev, I assume that's not a problem for you. But, the next step above that is ""can you understand more than one paradigm?"" E.g., can you only understand imperative, classical OO code, or can you also write declarative and functional-style code, and can you recognize when to use one or the other? I don't really have good resources for that kind of thing, though I wish I did. That's where a lot of the mentoring comes in.<p>Those things are important partly because of new-ish additions to JavaScript, like the functional-style array methods (map, forEach, some, etc.). So now I want to know, how familiar are you with the JavaScript ""standard library"" in different browsers? And how familiar are you with JavaScript design, like the Module Pattern. For that kind of stuff, MDN (Mozilla Developer Network) is my favorite reference, along with an ability to Google.<p>Then I want to know if you can use the DOM. Again, MDN, along with sites like html5rocks and caniuse.com, are great. But I also want to know if read and understand specs; partially for reference when other documentation doesn't exist, partly so you can implement them (either because we need a polyfill for a standard that the browser is missing or because the boss has just given you a spec for a new product). I don't know of good resources for that, except for just reading a lot of specs.<p>My methods for helping learn so far are basically just assigning lots of little tasks that shouldn't be too difficult or take too long, and then when it does turn out to be too difficult and take too long, using pair programming to walk him through solving the problem.",1352915990

In the context of the thread, that statement is not just wrong, but dangerously wrong. So I write a comment saying why.<p>Most of the time, it is easier to dash off a short comment that says something wrong, like, ""pretty much any software"" is going to involve grappling with cryptosystems, than it is to write a comment that thoroughly refutes that wrongness.<p>Also, the space of possible wrong things you could write, like, ""there's a lot of good available to be done by helping educate engineers"" about how to write bespoke custom cryptosystems, is much larger than the space of things you can write that are even strictly speaking correct. So I'm at a double disadvantage.<p>Ultimately, while I am happy to hear that you find my other comments helpful, I just do not care that you find my condescending, combative, or overly prolific on this thread.

It fails on two level as your users you are trying to message don't even get the point of reference.<p>It's great to be inspired, but if you truly want to nurture a community with its own identity, then this is probably hurting rather than helping. Focus on them, 100%.<p>Hubski is a good example of a site that is obviously inspired by HN (it is also coded in Arc, and started as a port), but went off and did its own thing from a community, mechanic, and feature point of view.<p>Even in your 'How it works' page you instruct users to post and go on about HN again:<p><i>>We are hoping that you take the steps to not only read and vote the posts, but also to submit and comment on posts. One of the reasons Hacker News is such a popular and useful site is how the users interact with each other.</i><p>It just sort of comes across as commanding your users to post so you can be like HN. That's not compelling. The focus should be on building a place your users <i>want</i> to use, -whatever that takes. What's in it for them?<p>I hope none of this comes across as harsh. Take the focus of HN and point it at your community with the same passion and obvious admiration, and I think you'll be better rewarded.

In fact, most of modern sovereign-state politics is run on 18th century enlightenment ideas. One would expect that people could be voting from the comfort of their homes, not just every 4 years, but a lot more often on matters that affect them directly, like local issues. Also, political discourse should not be based on putting on 2 shows on TV every 4 years. The internet is a great medium of discourse, and can be used to bring up the issues that really matter and the politicians that can actually deliver, instead of the ones willing to succumb to the powers that control media/big capital.<p>I am aware of very few platforms that use the internet for what it's best at: giving everyone a voice.

You can encapsulate away the state behind an opaque type so that it can be only accessed by functions that you have defined. Whether this is a good choice is up to the programmer, but it's common practice in haskell to use domain-specific types wherever it makes sense.<p>For UIs and such, in addition to monads there are more powerful abstractions, but at no point is it necessary to leak information to the client. The common UI toolkits tend to have some impedance mismatch with FP because they've been designed with OOP in mind, but this is not the fault of FP.<p>Of course, in FP it often doesn't even make sense to encapsulate everything. Why hide useful data when it's guaranteed that any user will not be able to misuse it?<p>Haskell provides tools for abstraction that are IMO vastly superior to anything I've seen in an OOP language. If anything, you're more likely to have leaky abstractions and failed encapsulation in Java or C++ compared to Haskell, simply because of mutable state, closed classes, and limited expressiveness of the type system.",1352915185

The traversal of this structure can be called an algorithm, albeit a simple one.<p>Manipulation of the linked list often requires a traversal. Also, inserting data between nodes also require a little juggling of the node pointers. These are all what you can call 'algorithms'. Data structures can exist and be learnt somewhat independently of their underlying algorithms, but it is rarely useful like that.<p>There are however pure algorithms that do not care much about the underlying data structure - insertion sort is an example.\nMost data structures though aren't very much useful when separated from their fundamental algorithms.<p>Hope that answers your question.",1352915069

But society isnt a building. Its parts are people, not struts or circuits. That is why a humanistic education is far more useful to the policymaker (and by extension, the citizen) than a technical one.<p>I call it the ""binary geek fallacy"". Some people tend to assume that scientists, engineers and especially programmers deal <i>only</i> with hard facts and precise measurements, think in ""zeroes and ones"" (literally heard that in a recent discussion with friends) and reject emotional thinking in favour of logical, which - they say - isn't able to describe the entire reality (or even the more important parts).<p>It is of course wrong. The thing they don't seem to understand is that math is capable of not only describing ""hard facts and precise measurements"", but fuzzy facts and educated guesses as well. And it does it much, much better than intuition, or ""heart"", or common sense. Moreover, STEM thinking allows you to <i>abstract</i> over those sophisticated, supposedly too imprecise things, to get something one can work on. If something is too difficult to comprehend, we'll keep using Science and Maths and Engineering on it until it becomes easy, and thus we'll have another tool in our arsenal. That is how progress in thinking is done.<p>There's also no problem with (false) logical vs. emotional thinking modes dichotomy. Just pull both of them into the model you work with, and you'll be fine.<p>Math is nothing more, than applied thinking - human brain at its best.<p>>Here are some of the things that the humanities, and the habits of alertness that they foster, will teach you: that people have different but equally valid perspectives;<p>People do not have different but equally valid perspectives, it's a recipe to pass bullshit around.<p>>  that the truth is not necessarily hard and precise;<p>Of course it's not. But engineers can, and do deal with it quite well, using methods much better than waving hands and doing things because they feel or sound good.<p>> that judgments of value cannot be reduced to judgments of fact;<p>Wait until neuro- and cognitive scienctists disassemble the brain.

If you're basing your values upon incorrect facts, your values are very likely to be mistaken. For example, if you state that another person is not deserving of moral consideration, that is a judgement of value which may or may not be valid. However, if your justification for that judgement is hearsay evidence or religious bias, then that judgement starts to look very shaky.<p>You've committed the same error. One ramification of the is-ought divide is that ultimately, ethical norms are assertions divorced from empirical basis. Saying that 'murder is wrong' is epistemologically very similar whether it is based on some religious text or something like ""what would society be like if we allowed people to murder each other?"". It is simply expressing a preference for one empirical state over another empirical state, and absent some transcendental determinant, no final conclusion can decisively be reached.",1352912937

The things he quotes as the reason poli-sci-types and not engineers should be the ones running government is that they learn ""that people have different but equally valid perspectives; that the truth is not necessarily hard and precise; that judgments of value cannot be reduced to judgments of fact; that society will never be a smoothly functioning machine.""<p>The problem is that those things are all <i>INTUITIVE CONCLUSIONS</i>.  You could learn them by never getting a Lib Arts degree and never really even studying them formally.  In fact, I would say most Lib Arts people I know struggle with those things and most engineers/scientists seem to get them on a fundamental level.  The difference is that engineers and scientists dedicate themselves to understading how to dissect and solve problems - even when the solutions might be difficult or counter-intuitive to get to.<p>We are categorically worse off as a nation for handing our government over to the poli-sci complex.  It is just the epitome of conceit that someone who never solves any complex problems should be allowed to annoint themselves as legislators over those that do.<p>Go down the chain of control for the Presidency.  You have to get to like 16 (Secy of Transportation or something like that, I forget) before you find someone with a real science or engineering degree.

4784209,comment,4718497,4763595,1,0,pfedor,,,"OK I got hold of the paper, which is a very nice read, I can email it to you if you want.  It's from a talk David Deutsch gave at some conference, I bet he is a very entertaining speaker.  My summary won't do it justice, but anyway.  The experiments are the following:<p>Experiment 1:<p>Measure the current time and call it t1.  Note that you are conscious at the time you are observing the value t1.  Wait.  Check your watch again.  It is showing a different time t2 now.  You are still conscious and your consciousness is in a different state than at t1. Therefore you've detected experimentally a superposition of distinct states of human consciousness, since there exists a formulation of Quantum Mechanics in which time is a regular operator like any other observable and you've observed two different values of it.<p>Experiment 2:<p>Consider a computer which is so well isolated that interference can be observed between it's computational states.  The computer is programmed to perform an algorithm which takes one bit of input, and produces one bit of output.  The algorithm is very computationally expensive and takes a long time T to complete.  We communicate with the computer via two observables, I (for input) and O (for output).<p>Prepare the initial state as a superposition of both input values 1/sqrt(2) * (|I=0> + |I=1>).  After the time T, the computer will be in the state 1/sqrt(2) (|I=0,O=f(0)> + |I=1,O=f(1)>), where f(n) is the output the algorithm produces for the input n.  So by measuring I and O at this point we will either learn the value f(0) or f(1), but not both.  But say we are really interested in f(0) XOR f(1).  Classically, it's impossible to calculate it without computing both f(0) and f(1) so it has to take the time 2T.  But with our computer, which is in a quantum superposition of states, and with the help of some clever algebra, we can construct another observable R.  When we measure R one of the two things happen with equal probabilities: either we get the correct value of f(0) XOR f(1), or we lose any hope of learning it from our system.  We know which one happened, i.e., with probability 0.5 we will have the correct value for f(0) XOR f(1) and we will know for sure it is correct.<p>Since we obtained f(0) XOR f(1) in half the time, clearly there existed two parallel worlds in which two versions of the computer calculated f(0) and f(1).<p>(It is noted that some members of the audience objected that Experiment 2 is conceptually no different from the two-slit interference experiment.  The author allows that this may be so in a sense, since indeed, the two-slit experiment alone should be enough to make it obvious that the Everett's interpretation is right, however Experiment 2 makes it even more obvious.)<p>Experiment 3 (simplified version):<p>Consider a system consisting of a spin 1/2 particle and a quantum computer running a simulation of human consciousness.  Prepare the spin in the state |> = 1/sqrt(2) (|>+|>), i.e., measuring the spin along the x axis will always show it's pointing to the right, which means that measuring the spin along the z axis may give up or down with equal probabilities.  Have the conscious being in the computer measure the spin along the z axis and communicate to the outside world the fact that he/she observed one of the values 'up' or 'down' (without saying which one).  Then undo all the transitions the combined system underwent, i.e., revert it to the original state (which is in principle possible for a system consisting of a quantum computer and a microscopic system).  Then measure the spin of the particle along the x axis.  If it shows 'right' every time (we need to repeat the whole procedure many times), then the Everett interpretation must be true, since otherwise the fact that a conscious being observed 'up' or 'down' would have caused the particle to collapse to a state in which 'left' and 'right' are equally likely.<p>(The original formulation of Experiment 3 was more complicated, with three spins not one and some more clever algebra, the purpose of which if I understand correctly is to prove that it's possible to communicate to the outside world the fact that a measurement along z axis was taken, without losing the ability to revert the system to the original state.)<p>So, there.  I'll let you form your own judgement.<p><i>Counter to your previous assertion, we could in theory experimentally determine whether this is true via trained rats: (1) Train a rat to perform measurements, (2) kill the rat before it has a chance to tell you the results, (3) check to see whether wave function has collapsed.</i><p>It doesn't work that way, because even if the rat doesn't cause the wave function to collapse, it interacts with the system and causes a transition, from the original state to a state which is a superposition of states corresponding to various values the rat might have gotten from the measurement, each of these states individually looking exactly as if the rat collapsed the wave function, with the coefficients such that the probabilities for each value come out right.  And killing the rat afterwards does not undo it.  So you will observe that the wave function has collapsed.  Same if you use a mechanical detector in place of a rat.",1352912682

4784179,comment,4763564,4783933,1,0,lmm,,,">Unless you are advocating using some kind of class system for styling within javascript, which is odd since CSS already offers that. If you are speaking of applying CSS classes through javascript, which sounds like what you are describing, then I'm confused over what the point is. You can create CSS classes and apply them to elements on the fly right now, you just seem to saying you want to create the CSS classes in javascript. Which makes no sense when you can do the exact same thing more efficiently in an external style sheet. The reason it is more efficient is because those classes will not need to be created on every single page load.<p>I'm advocating using whatever programming language you use to apply behaviour to your site, whether that be javascript or something else, to apply a style where it's needed, rather than via CSS selectors. Any language you're using to generate web pages will already have this functionality, because it's needed to e.g. attach event handlers (or equivalent) to text boxes. If your application uses jquery, use that (but it's probably not the best example, because jquery uses pretty much the same selector syntax). If your application uses some awful adobe templating engine and does everything via XPath, use that. If your application uses a java class hierarchy, use that. Etc.<p>>I would say your solution has more of a learning curve involved because you are adding completely new syntax and logic to javascript when it wasn't designed to do these things.<p>I think javascript is already very much optimized for functions of the form: find some subset of the elements on the page, and then do something to them.<p>>The solution is to update what the browsers expect from CSS. There is no reason why CSS itself cannot be extended to do what you are speaking of, probably most people (including me) would want that functionality right now.<p>Unfortunately the W3C is unwilling to even add variables to CSS. Even if they did, it would be years before we could rely on new functionality being present in end-user browers - and then what if we realised we wanted some additional functionality? Better for the logic to be written in server-side code, and we can use new languages as they're invented. (With javascript we don't get to use new language features but we can at least use new libraries, which is more than can be said for CSS)<p>>Much like my three examples you pretty much ignored, you still have to learn the CSS syntax and capabilities regardless of how you feed it to browser. Unless you advocate coming up with a whole new styling language that eventually outputs to CSS<p>Up to a point. Things like the box model there's no getting away from, but I see no need to use the CSS syntax or CSS selectors. Just like the way we currently handle the DOM, there can be a single styling API but you can use it in javascript with javascript syntax, or in python with python syntax, or in whichever language you like.<p>>Styles are not part of your markup, period. Well, maybe inline styles but, again, that's bad.<p>Without/before CSS, all styling was inline, i.e. part of your markup. The whole reason CSS was invented was, as I originally said, to provide a way to reuse (some small specific parts of) your markup in several places.",1352912451

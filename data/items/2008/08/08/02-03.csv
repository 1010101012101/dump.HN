270243,comment,269232,269389,0,0,anewaccountname,,,"It seems to me that Amway is not so much a pyramid scheme itself, more of a platform which makes it trivially easy to start one if you are so inclined. It will be interesting to see whether that becomes the typical use pattern, or whether the discovery and reward process ends up being more organic than pyramid-like.",1218163945

One time, we went into his room and realized he left himself logged in as root, so we changed his password, then taunted him about it over IRC as he frantically tried to pwn his own computer. Good times.<p>/Geek",1218163942

270240,comment,270160,270160,0,0,jrockway,,,"It really scares me how poorly security is done.  You'd think that when you are designing a system that will be used by tens of millions of people every day, you might factor in a few thousand bucks to pay some security firm to look over your spec or design documents.<p>I guess this is what happens when the government is legally required to contract out to the lowest bidder.  Your tax dollars get wasted and your personal information is compromised.  Thanks for saving me $20, government.",1218163584

An attacker could overwrite every tag passing a certain intersection and cause havoc in the toll system.</i><p>Unbelieveable.<p>One thing, though:<p><i>When a tag read fails now, the system takes a picture of your license plate so a human can determine what account it belongs to. The system could be updated to randomly take photos of cars that were reading correctly just to make sure the ID belongs to the car pictured.</i><p>I would assume that this is happening: Every car that passes through a gate is also being photographed, and that data is being kept for somewhere between 60 days and forever. If you rewrite your RFID tag with Arnold Schwarzenegger's ID, there's a good chance you'll get busted if and when he complains, because they'll look up the photos.",1218162786

(I am thinking of ""turn on the LED"" type things.)  The basic stamp does really well here, despite being proprietary, horribly limited computationally, and locked-in to one of the worst programming languages ever designed (PBASIC).  I remember it offending my sensibilities even when I was in middle school :)<p>Programming I/O in Haskell would be fun.  What would you call the ""turn on the LED"" monad? :)",1218161430

The researchers who did the studies are are identified only as (I'm not making this up) ""North Carolina"", ""Virginia"", and ""Ontario.""  The results apparently are that traffic light cameras (hidden devices) are linked to an increase in crashes, but doesn't even attempt to offer a hypothesis as to why.<p>There's no content here, just opinion.",1219463007

What will happen in this perfectly valid Ruby code? Where do the parentheses belong? Do you know off the top of your head?<p>While any programmer who would write this deserves to be fired, I can't come up with a good reason why it should be valid to write it in the first place.",1219462359
284444,comment,283825,284017,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"Google ads are a market, and the market accounts for it. Advertisers pay lower CPC because of the cost of junk clicks. If junk clicks were somehow eliminated, they'd get a higher action rate per click and would therefore pay more for those clicks.<p>The only people who are hurt are the legitimate publishers. When you click an ad you aren't interested in, you effectively lower the CPC for all publishers. This helps the site you're on, but hurts all the rest who show ads of the same category.",1219462279

I know Ruby well but Python only rudimentarily, so I'm curious what the rough equivalent would look like.  If you don't feel like doing that, fine, but I'm just going to ignore your arguments.",1219461847

It's good for their business, but so would sending someone with a club to force me to buy more toner whether I need it or not. Somewhere there's a limit to what's sane for a company to do.<p>Either way, their good business is hurting my business by artificially preventing me from making maximal use of the supplies I buy. Workarounds are possible but annoying. I demand that I am allowed to actually use what I pay for without jumping through hoops.",1219461572

It represents the end-game of the smartphone disruption of laptops and PCs, because you will ""dock"" it at home and work, yet still have all your data with you whereever you go (despite coverage, network outages, webapp provider downtime etc etc etc) like people used to do with their laptops. A bit like the portable diskdrive that the iPod was.<p>You might think Apple would be hesitant to do this, because it will cannibalize their own laptops and desktops. I think they will do it as soon as they can, because: they have a history of racing down the tech curve as fast as possible; if they don't do it and it's possible to do, someone else will, and the strategic losses from not being first are enormous; it will only <i>start</i> to cannibalize their other products (because a smartphone really isn't as good yet; people are familiar with the old way; power users are a long way off being disrupted).<p>I've been waiting for this.

They absolutely sucked.  I suspect that Google understood what it took to build a mobile OS that enabled easier search.  And they got so fed up by the horrid interfaces of the OEMs (seriously, remember how terrible every single one of them was?) that they jumpstarted the process.<p>Better mobile OS = better adoption, more searched per handset.  More revenue.<p>You can either try to take a bigger piece of the pie, or make the pie bigger.  Google's strategy is to make the pie bigger (and with their top of mind branding, they also get the biggest slice).  Combine that with the phone manufacturers' stunning incompetence in building a decent interface, and you have the perfect situation for google to build android.<p>The less generous side of me also realizes that google understood that the OS developer had great control over the handsets (defaults are a very powerful force).  And if a competitor (say, Nokia) were to get huge adoption of a phone OS, they would naturally be drawn to build their own ad system.  Just look at how Apple did with the iOS apps.",1299200151

Since I <i>know</i> I'm right when I go to meetings this prepared it isn't an issue, right? ;-)<p>However, the main problem I found with this approach is not that it leads to me to reach detailed conclusions without all the input I may need to do so. I'm fortunate that a lot of people I meet with are either smart, experienced, stubborn, or some combination of the three - the information needed to reach a sensible consensus will often emerge.<p>Instead, what concerns me is the sheer amount of time it takes to do this much preparation and the opportunity cost I have to pay while I'm busy trying to get an ""A"" on one particular meeting.<p>There's a lot to be said for ""winging it"" (or, in the recent history of memes, ""doing it live""). If you're confident in your ideas and in your ability to persuade people then over-preparing is a waste of time akin to procrastination.<p>I can't guarantee that arriving for a meeting without elaborate handouts will always lead to a better result. But in my experience I'd rather get 80% of what I want in 3 meetings than 100% of what I want in only 1 meeting.<p>Disclaimer: This advice obviously doesn't apply to the once-in-a-blue-moon meeting, e.g. meeting with a potential investor or asking your boss for a raise.

It was a pretty cool job. I had lots of power and I felt like I was ""the one"" who would usher this paper into a web 2.0 era. I came up with this grand plan and all. Unfortunately, much of the rest of my board was largely incompetent (or this was what I thought). Also, running the college newspaper wasn't as much of a passion for them as it was for me. They all had better things to do.<p>Ofcourse the natural resulted. Lots of meeting where we would not make quorom. Discussions without reading the background material however earlier on we had sent out a padded agenda etc. Naturally also, I was the most prepared for most of the meetings. I knew our Byelaws and PnP in and out and ofcourse, I knew the operations and management procedure for the newspaper, start to finish at the back of my hand. I got my way at meetings a lot of the time because no one at the table knew better and the people who knew better knew I was (mostly) right.<p>Soon enough however, resentment had begun to build. I was ""arrogant"" and an ""asshole"". We were always moving ""too fast"" even when it was clearly the right management decision (often taken 2 weeks after it should have). My VP was beginning to overrule management decisions we had discussed at meetings she had failed to attend for one reason or the other. In short, it was chaos.<p>I started work in May. By October, I was insane, overworked, single and had not spoken to my family in months. I resigned.<p>Long story short: If you are banking on the ignorance of your team to succeed in a project by pushing through your agenda. You have already lost. Surround yourself with people smarter than yourself, who will come to meetings as prepared as you are. Watch your project, team, committee soar.

That's what we've all been told is the sort of ideal situation a credit card is good for - but then I realize, that implies you are living check to check - which is already a bad position to be in - the credit card might save you in that moment, but it won't fix the overall financial problem you have.<p>(gonna ramble here)
As soon as people start working, whether in highschool, college, or after, they should start forming a cushion.   That cushion should on average grow throughout their entire working life.  This isn't retirement savings.  It's not an investment. When it gets big enough, sure, you can cap it and start investing, etc.. you don't need 10 years living expenses sitting in the bank.... but what about 6 months? What about a year?  That's not absurd to me. Imagine the comfort of knowing you can lose your job, maybe be a bit more frugal, maybe pause on contributing to your retirement fund and no big vacation this year, but you have enough liquid cash in the bank that you don't need to work for a year.  That cash becomes something you treasure.  You don't WANT to dip into it.  You won't just blow it on junk once it gets bigger. YOu won't just take a year off for fun - you'll just take comfort in the fact that you don't care when payday is and can think long term. You can make rational decisions about your job, changes in life, etc.  It keeps you far, far away from the punishing cycle of debt the banking industry makes it so easy for you to get caught up in.  It gives you HUGE leverage in financial situations.<p>It's basically cash in the bank that you can call on at any time.  Anyone who has been working more than a few months should not be living paycheck to paycheck - if we could just get that message across to more people, things would be a lot better for all.
People always say ""oh, easy for you to say, I have expenses, blah blah...."".   Those same people, if given a 50% raise, will tend to increase their spending habits by 50% and still live paycheck to paycheck.<p>We need to stop thinking like a credit society.  The credit score needs to stop being the most important financial market we measure by.<p>Even when it comes to housing - We need to stop talking about ""buying a house"" when we mean ""mortgaging a house"".<p>Everyone always counters with ""Well, how else am I supposed to afford a house?"".  One answer might be ""If you don't have enough to buy the house outright, you CANT afford the house"". 
Sure, there are reasonably low risk situations responsible people can put themselves in and buy rather than rent, and come out ahead - but how many people actually do that -vs- get into the danger zone? I wonder.<p>Some cultures work for the benefit of future generations - they are a generation ahead at all times.  The parents buy the house and pay for school for the kids when they grow up/get married/whatever, as their parents did for them.  The kids, grown up, finished school, work to save up money to buy their kids an education and a house, and so on.  What rule says we have to stay behind, when we could be a generation ahead with a little planning?<p>TL;DR:  Agreed",1299198966

DNS updates will be a while to re-map but maybe your ""old"" provider can help you with a temporary redirection. Get this up and running as fast a possible, even if you use a temporary domain name. Go, do it. Now.<p>Then, the post game analysis. Server apocalypses happen. There is a deeper lesson here.<p>On the technical side, there are some things you can do to prevent this kind of failure. Running fsck for hours on a live server is really inexcusable both from a technical as well as a service point of view. Most small hosting providers simply rent some rack space, put in their standard Dell server unit and call it a day. This way lies madness, total data loss and possibly the early seeds of an anxiety disorder. I'd suggest you look into inherently redundant hosting offers (like MediaTemple's grid service) or some high-availability virtual hosting (like Amazon EC2).<p>But the core of the issue is unrelated to this technical stuff. Telling everyone at once was a mistake. There is a reason why most projects start out gradually, starting with a beta phase when everyone still has a lot of compassion for bugs and crashes. It's tempting to send invites to all possible contacts once you're finished, but it really has no upside because you're introducing a single point of failure. I'm not even talking about having only one server and no backup. In this case, the blitzkrieg launch date itself was that single point of failure. Even if the server hadn't crashed and burned, your app is very likely to still have bugs and kinks to work out. Bringing potential clients in one by one would have given you the opportunity to collect valuable feedback so you can show a more refined version to people who come in later.<p>When it comes to handling this issue from the CR side: don't send out apologies for the outage. Instead, check back with high-potential contacts in a few days and ask ""did you have a chance to look at my new project?"" and when they reply they couldn't access the server, invite them to try again and concede there were some outages but the problem is fixed now. My guess is, you'll be surprised how few people were actually affected and noticed that the server was gone.<p>In my opinion, it's unlikely that your bad luck actually ruined anything. Most people don't look at random invites in their mail right away. If they're really interested in the product and/or know you personally, they'll check back again later even if your site is offline at first. Interested people will still look at your stuff. Chances are, those candidates for your first mass invite will not even turn out to be your most valuable clients. Nothing is lost.",1299198842

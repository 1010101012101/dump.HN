But it tends to impede short term progress and create stress for those remaining after a key employee leaves - the sorts of problems the alleged no-poach agreements allegedly sought to mitigate.<p>Now there may be something else that motivated Altman&#x27;s essay, but it is almost certainly related to YC and the idea of improving employee equity appears to have been seen as a potential solution to some trend in their data. I think that YC came to believe turnover was impacting rates of return, and YC has had to think about ways to mitigate it. They&#x27;re at the point now where they would have that data and some companies in their portfolio are mature enough where brain drain has a significant impact. For example, they could be running regressions around on former employees of portfolio companies applying to YC against the return rates of investments in the former employers.<p>There&#x27;s the pursuit of better returns in there somewhere, and I reserve the right to pull another theory out of my ass at a later date.",1397883597

This seems pretty false in my opinion.<p>It seems much more likely that sound bite consumables are the outcome of testing/feedback and iteration. It seems entirely possible to me(if not probable) that consumers(for the most part) don&#x27;t know what they truly &#x27;want&#x27; in terms of news.<p>We live in a world of(largely) instant gratification; the fact that &#x27;news&#x27; would have to adapt to fit that lifestyle makes perfect sense to me.<p>> People will blame consumers for how media is but then say this about technology: &quot;If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses.&quot;<p>What point are you trying to make here? I&#x27;m having difficulty parsing your meaning. Humans, when they aren&#x27;t versed in the underlying operations of a system, WILL make broad assumptions(about said operations) and WILL have irrational expectations and &#x27;wants&#x27; based on those assumptions.  \nWhat would my grandmother(or even mother for that matter) ask me to improve about her spyware-ridden current-gen laptop? &quot;Make it faster.&quot; If I asked her how to improve the news on the other hand I guarantee &quot;make it faster&quot; would not enter the conversation.<p>Soooo, what&#x27;s your point here? That consumers do want &#x27;faster&#x27; news? And why would a consumer&#x27;s desire for more succinct news imply that they are okay with less accurate news...?<p>Obviously the issue isn&#x27;t cut and dry, everyone is a consumer of the news and we all have our own opinions. That said, I have a hard time disagreeing with the parent comment. Have you watched the news recently? &#x27;News&#x27; stories are NOT given time based on their importance to the world as a whole; and for good reason. When a media company(whose purpose is to provide fiscal return) is met with positive feedback for stories pertaining to popular culture, or pandering to popular opinion, they will invariably continue to publish in that vertical. The result is a &#x27;news&#x27; which consists mainly of stories which are either racially/politically charged or major events(read: actual news) which are strung along for weeks(natural disasters, terrorists actions, etc...)",1397882221

7612603,comment,7609509,7612569,2,0,mfheretic,,,"It&#x27;s the most serious question of all. The evidence is extremely mixed. I love David Roodman&#x27;s Time Magazine quote for its brevity:<p>&quot;On current evidence, the best estimate of the average impact of microcredit on the poverty of clients is zero&quot;<p><a href=""http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2103831,00.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2103831,00...</a><p>Needless to say the debate rages on. The Zidisha discussion detracts from this central point, but on valid grounds. To some extent the shortfalls of microfinance may be due to the high interest rates charged, the restrictive loan conditions, the profit motivation, the aggressive intermediating MFIs etc., some of which Zidisha addresses. However, if you read the work of Milford Bateman, for example, he raises more fundamental questions about microfinance. In the P2P space profit is not really an option, and in Zidisha&#x27;s case it is debatable whether one can even break-even. But look at the higher levels, the profits accumulating to Accion in the IPO of Compartamos; the millions made in the IPO of SKS, or at some of the microfinance investment funds - these are the big boys, and at that level yes, there are vast profits to be made. Motivation is a hard thing to prove, but you are right to suggest that profit has come to play an unhealthy role in the debate. The sector is extremely opaque, transparency is rare, there are rampant conflicts of interest and ill-aligned incentives. It is largely unregulated in practice, despite endless window-dressing to the contrary. And when some new start-up promotes microloans for poor people to connect their houses to the drinking water supply, as sensible and this might superficially seem, isn&#x27;t this a public good that the government should provide?<p>Reading the standard microfinance mantra one could be forgiven for concluding that all the world&#x27;s problems can be solved with loans, and that profit maximisation is the best structure to arrange this. We are familiar with the theory, but the evidence is sorely lacking.",1397882036

Because prices are reacting in large part to news.  To the degree that the news presents something material and unsuspected it influenced peoples trading.  Of course good news doesn&#x27;t always lead a stock to increase, because sometimes most investors are expecting better news.  Certainly there is a lot of randomness, but for heavily traded stocks the impact of news is real and substantial.  Unexpected good news most often leads to an increase in stock price, and unexpected bad new most often leads to a decrease.",1397880690

7612561,comment,7602250,7609443,1,0,logicchains,,,"That&#x27;s a good point. I think however that proponents of economic decentralisation would argue that it requires &#x27;less&#x27; centralisation of power than economic centralisation (assuming centralisation of power can be quantified).<p>How is this so? Classical liberals argued that the fundamental duty of government was protecting its citizens&#x27; lives and property rights from each other and from foreign aggressors. This would largely take place through the courts: if someone attacked you, or stole your property, or rose up and took over your factory, you could sue them, and the State&#x27;s only role would be enforcing the court&#x27;s judgement.<p>This thus would lead to a relatively decentralised power structure, with most power lying in the courts via their interpretation of the constitution / &#x27;natural law&#x27; (a bit like English common law) and the executive having relatively little influence.<p>From this it follows that arguments for any economic structure other than &quot;an economy the structure of which is purely determined by what occurs when the State only protects property rights&quot; necessarily require more centralisation of power, as the State would be required to do more than just protect property rights.<p>Assuming that by some intrinsic property that &quot;an economy the structure of which is purely determined by what occurs when the State only protects property rights&quot; is likely to be a more decentralised one, then arguing for a centralised one thus entails arguing for greater centralisation of power.<p>Of course, this ultimately depends on the exact form the property rights in question take, but I think it&#x27;s reasonable to suggest that for any particular set of rights, a State based solely around defending those rights would involve less centralisation of power than one based upon ensuring the existence of a particular economic or social structure.<p>&#x27;Victimless crimes&#x27; are an example of this: they wouldn&#x27;t exist in a purely rights-based legal system as there&#x27;d be no parties whose rights were violated by these activities, so such things as the immigration department and the departments required for the war on drugs simply wouldn&#x27;t exist.",1397880247

7973986,comment,7973833,7973833,14,0,schoen,,,"I think it&#x27;s strange to say that a project with source code published under an open source license isn&#x27;t open source because it isn&#x27;t developed in a collaborative way with public input.  We need different terminology to distinguish these things.<p>There are a number of closely-held and opaque projects that practice software development in a not-particularly-transparent way and don&#x27;t solicit or welcome input from the general public.  Their output can still be open source, though!  It&#x27;s just not what people have grown to expect.<p>Historically, a lot of the Free Software Foundation&#x27;s projects were like this.  They didn&#x27;t offer public access to their version control systems, the development was primarily done by officially FSF-approved developers, and they made (sometimes relatively infrequent) periodic official source releases with lots of big changes.  Some people called these intermittent releases &quot;throwing code over the transom&quot;.  They didn&#x27;t always specifically invite the public to take an ongoing active role (though of course outside developers did contribute patches).<p>Another interesting example is NetHack (whose official Dev Team is famously secretive and slow to make official releases), and, until recently (except for the licensing problems) TrueCrypt.  And, so I&#x27;ve heard, the Android Open Source Project.<p>The article says<p>The original idea behind “the commons” was that by everyone putting in a little bit we could build software better and more sustainably.<p>I find this a little historically suspect. It depends on whose notion of the commons and at what point in software history.  Some notions of nonproprietary software with rather long historical pedigrees include: it&#x27;s culturally weird to restrict who can use software or for what; it&#x27;s too much bother to try to restrict the use or distribution of software; end users deserve control and freedom when they use software; making software available for unrestricted use helps it become part of infrastructure that its developers and other people value; getting open source software out there helps commoditize complementary goods.<p>And there are some rather concrete reasons that someone would want open source software instead of proprietary software even if it&#x27;s not developed in a collaborative way <i>at all</i>.<p>* Transparency about what the software does<p>* The ability to do audits for backdoors, bugs, and malware<p>* The right to fork the code if one&#x27;s interests or judgments diverge sharply from the upstream developers&#x27; over the long run<p>* Avoiding the risk of abandonware if the upstream developer goes out of business or decides to stop developing the software",1404255351

With your CC info, he can make fraudulent purchases (obviously).<p>Even virtual credit cards are not safe from fraud. Some transactions over the maximum spending limit or expiration date might still go through [1]. This makes none of them truly single-use since multiple charges can go through. Also, they are a PITA to use especially if you want to regenerate a one-off CC number for every transaction (which nobody does - there is no such thing as a &quot;token generator&quot; as you claim). For these reasons banks have been in fact discontinuing virtual CC services over the last few years, eg. see [2].<p>By contrast, a Bitcoin transaction is truly a one-time payment that is cryptographically authorizing a specific payment amount to a specific address, and nothing more.<p>[1] <a href=""http://lifehacker.com/5831160/use-virtual-credit-card-numbers-to-shop-safely-online-keeping-in-mind-the-downsides"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lifehacker.com/5831160/use-virtual-credit-card-number...</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://slickdeals.net/f/6614180-discover-is-discontinuing-their-virtual-credit-card-vcc-system-secure-online-account-numbers"" rel=""nofollow"">http://slickdeals.net/f/6614180-discover-is-discontinuing-th...</a>",1404255324

What they don&#x27;t always think about is providing value to the social sites.<p>HN is probably better than most about not letting much crap on the home page, but these sites are almost universally terrible at surfacing new content so that it has a good opportunity to get up voted.<p>The selfish human response is to get your friends to vote for you (just like you get your friends to vote for you in real life actually). It&#x27;s just that there are so few actual people looking at the submitted stories that it wouldn&#x27;t take much to astroturf your way on to the front page without a voting ring filter.<p>The best solution is very likely to have a better interface for surfacing submitted stories to a wider audience. Or, incentivize people to actually look at the new section.

This means that cars turning across a pedestrian crossing must give way (yield) to pedestrians.<p>The UK system, by contrast, isolates the pedestrian phase from traffic phases: when the green man (the WALK indicator) is displayed, no vehicles will approach the pedestrian crossing from any direction. The time between pedestrian crossing opportunities is longer, but there is no contention for the crossing from cars turning into the road.<p>The article describes the parallel/perpendicular system. In this scenario, a driver will see a parallel WALK light and a (vehicular) green light at the same time. As the pedestrian crossing typically goes red earlier (because people take longer to cross the road than cars take to cross the intersection), a car driver who watches the pedestrian crossing light or countdown timer gains advanced knowledge of the parallel traffic signal.<p>1.

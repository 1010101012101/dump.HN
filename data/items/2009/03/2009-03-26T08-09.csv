If you didn't want to be placed in to the common pot of the 47 other countries in Europe then perhaps you should have specified your own country?<p>Germany has the 2nd highest population of 82 million and is a country of which I am a citizen. That makes me a European, and a member of the EU. Does this mean my own experience and own opinion are less valid than yours because you're from a different country?<p>My skin is not as thick. But this is probably because you've offended me directly.",1238057803

We have both been working on a mutual startup products for a few years now. It has worked for us, probably because we are both different (optimist/dreamer vs pessimist/realist) yet the same (passionate, understand the same domain specific areas, work insane hours and love it).",1238057084

Your ""live demo"" doesn't show any visual difference because of your improper usage.<p>acronym is used for acronyms. Defining acronym, ""a word formed from the initial letters of the several words in the name""… The usage in your example just hurts my brain.<p>According the HTML specs, address is used to denote the address of the page creator: ""The ADDRESS element may be used by authors to supply contact information for a document or a major part of a document such as a form. This element often appears at the beginning or end of a document.""

W3C says, ""This attribute describes the relationship from the current document to the anchor specified by the href attribute. The value of this attribute is a space-separated list of link types.""<p>wbr is not in any HTML spec.

The pressures of working 24/7 on a startup don't always mesh with the ideal of a happy balanced relationship, especially if the startup founder is relying entirely on the other to be the breadwinner. I've not really been in that position myself, but I've heard a lot of stories about how relationships nearly died because of someone getting obsessed with a startup and neglecting their spouse.

For example, I'm on the EPIS programme in Scotland (<a href=""http://www.epis.org.uk"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.epis.org.uk</a> - shameless plug) which is effectively a year-long YC, giving you a £10k loan to get started, free office space and a ton of mentoring. (The reason I'm interested in YC is because Scottish mentors and investors, for the most part, don't 'get' emerging technologies.)<p>There's also the Royal Society Enterprise Fellowships, also in Scotland, which is an even cushier deal - you graduate straight from PhD to startup with a year's salary from the university and some small seed investment.<p>For the most part universities want to commercialise your work, so if you're a graduate with no money but a ton of great work you want to turn into a business, there is support there - you just have to know where to look.<p>This applies more to postgraduate students, mind; some of the things that supported me fresh out of my BA and looking to start some projects included a part time job that paid well enough to cover my basic expenses, leaving me free to tinker in the rest of the time, and doing a lot of freelance work which pretty much came to the same end. Having money saved up from internships and graduate stipends also helped, but I believe the system is a little different in the US ;)",1238054955

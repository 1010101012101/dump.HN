3219876,comment,3219531,3219783,3,0,jonnathanson,,,"<i>""Chasing eyeballs, at least to me, turns blogging into something a lot less fun.""</i><p>An important corollary to this is: chasing eyeballs without any way to retain them is neither fun nor productive. The article -- which I quite enjoyed -- does a nice job of pointing that out. And, while the point may sound obvious, it's certainly nontrivial and not immediately intuitive. And even if you have nothing tangible to sell, you're still ""selling"" your blog. So you've got to make it consistently engaging to the people you've decided to target.<p>The first mistake many bloggers make is to write for themselves. They assume that an article they found interesting to write will also be interesting to read -- or worse, that an overarching blog topic they love is interesting to a big group of people. Not always the case. You can write about your passions, and you can always lure in a bunch of outside readers with a well-marketed post. But don't expect everyone -- or even 99% of those whose attention you got -- to stick around if they don't care for the rest of the material on your blog.<p>I'm not advocating that everyone write big, general-interest, broad-topic blogs. The internet has enough of those. So writing about a niche domain is fine. Just <i>be consistent</i>, and stick within that domain. Deviate every now and then if you have something amazing to say. But don't be one of those blogs that's ostensibly about X, but veers off into Y and Z greater than 50% of the time. If I came to your blog to read about startup marketing strategies, I really don't care what you have to say about college basketball, or Call of Duty, or the pricing of the Harry Potter Blu-ray set. Don't write just anything that comes to mind. Have the discipline to stick to a domain and a ""brand."" Joel on Software is about Joel on software; it's not ""Joel on Software and Kittens and Foreign Film Reviews and Fixed-Gear Bikes and What He Saw at Starbucks The Other Day.""",1320929895

3219874,comment,3219144,3219144,3,0,bluesnowmonkey,,,"Having recently worked with a Ruby codebase where anything could be nil at anytime, I consider even references to nil to be a code smell.  Developers are inherently prone to ignoring error handling, so they'll happily ignore the fact that Order#customer really means Order#customer_or_nil.  And when they see errors in production, they'll slap an andand on it and call it fixed.  The code becomes extremely difficult to reason about.<p>I prefer that functions throw an exception when unable to do what they promised, rather than return nil or a null object.  The try-catch block serves as documentation that the function might fail.  If someone forgets to catch the exception, it will shut everything down rather than leave the program in an unanticipated state that could lead to an error elsewhere.",1320929741

I'm not entirely sure why an employer should reasonably expect to manage its exposure to employee underperformance risk on a dimension where the employee doesn't have similar recourse.<p>If employers are worried about a serious disconnect between performance over time and equity payout, they might cap the valuation of an equity stake by taking back call options with high strike valuations.  They could then give more shares or extinguish calls in response to performance.  But this would reduce the apparent value of the up-front stock grant, and thus the employee's incentive to come on board.<p>I don't know enough to support firm conclusions, but this doesn't sound like behavior I'd hope to emulate.",1320929664

Because your capital gain on the shares you took a pay cut for might at any time (for unvested stock) be reduced to your market value... which you could've simply earned elsewhere by taking that as a salary.<p>It's risk versus reward. What we see here, if true, is that the risk remains the same but the reward has been significantly chopped.<p>Dustin Markowitz [1] is a billionaire, largely by virtue of the ""skill"" of being Mark Zuckerberg's Harvard roommate. He ""earned"" ~$5 billion from Facebook, which if memory serves, is <i>less</i> than Steve Jobs made from Apple's second stint (where he, you know, turned a company on the verge of bankruptcy into a $300+ billion juggernaut with $80+ in cash and $100+ billion in annual revenue).

This is 'at-will employment' and is common in USA, but outright illegal in, say, the EU. If the employee was able to sue the company (potentially getting compensation) for a wrongful dismissal, then the company would not be able to fire people who didn't agree to the new vesting options.<p>IANAL, but there are a few ways you could lock yourself into this. Could you have your company in an EU member state, hence making yourself abide by EU law?

So edw519 is a liar.

I'd expect what you used for robotics was a ""fully rugged"" series: looks like a small case and can be rolled over by trucks (basically what they use in combat fields, truck shops and whatnot).<p>Those are pretty much indestructible short of using explosives (and even then), but they're big and heavy. Panasonic also has lines of wimpier ""business-rugged"" laptops built merely to withstand being dropped from tables, thrown against walls in fits of fury and having mugs of tea dropped on them.<p>They're also much more lightweight, and somewhat better looking.

3219788,comment,3214183,3214183,1,0,mahdireilly,,,"I am bipolar and my sleep is very erratic. I sometimes go 4-5 days without sleep and suffer no loss of productivity. Usually I sleep 3-4 hours a night and feel rested and ready to go. If my sleep goes unchecked, it can throw me into a manic state which is dangerous for my bank account, makes me very aggressive, and leaves me hunting down risky endeavors.  I was fine with that on my own, but since getting married I have to work fairly hard to keep more regular hours. My wife wants me to go to sleep when she does and dislikes waking up with me out of bed. Since she can sleep well into the afternoon when her schedule permits it is a challenge for me.<p>Over the past few years, I have done a ton of research on sleep, tried just about every over the counter and prescription medication, did a few sleep studies, and have tested different tons of sleep hygiene philosophies.<p>The key to me tuning my sleep has been by recording metrics of how I slept and looking for trends. I record when I sleep and wake, how hard it was to get to sleep and get up, my stress level and mood for the previous day, the medications and sleep-aid methods I am trying, the temperature, darkness, etc. Relying entirely on a subjective rating for sleep didn't work for me, so I use a fitbit to track how much I am moving during sleep, which can be correlated to how effective your sleep is.<p>In the last few months I have been able to not take any medication and maintain a regular(ish) sleeping schedule for the first time in probably 5 years.<p>Everyone has different methods that work for them so I will give you a few that work best for most without killing productivity:\n-Wake at the same time every morning, sleep when tired(If you don't fall asleep within 15 minutes, you aren't tired).\n-When waking, get as much light as you can. Watching the sunrise is both invigorating for your body and mind.\n-Exercise daily, even if its just taking a long walk.\n-2 hours before sleep avoid anything highly engaging such as media, games, and work(if you can manage). Try writing to empty your mind, or reading something that is not backlit. Dim the lights, stretch or do yoga, etc.\n-For those nights you can't stop working for those 2 hours, I use flux(mentioned below) and have found it to work well.\n-Don't try the polyphasic sleep except as a last resort.\n-Don't nap even for a few minutes.\n-Don't drink caffeine.\n...the list goes on.<p>My biggest piece of advice is to systematically try different techniques and to record your results. It will take a while to hone in on what is best since you likely have a schedule that varies daily.<p>I have encouraged many people to do this, even if they don't have trouble sleeping since you will discover what your body requires and not what your mind wants. Oversleeping can cause almost the same amount of health problems as not sleeping enough.<p>Fine-tuning your mind(this method is not limited to sleep) and body is one of the most important things you can do to make you healthy and productive. It amazes me that it is not more common...",1320926505

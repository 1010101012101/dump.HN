If you need, say, something that can parse rfc 822 messages, you have to read the rfc, implement it, find out which applications you need to talk to have implemented it incorrectly, and then work around those bugs.  Even if you could write the implementation in 2 minutes, you've still got a time consuming task on your hands.  Worse, you will probably need to implement more than one library for a medium sized application if you're using an unpopular language, so multipy the time it takes to finish the task above by x.",1210863419

190527,comment,190353,190353,0,0,maxklein,,,"The greatest tech trend that will happen is that the cell phone is going to change. The greatest change in the cell phone is going to be in the user interface, and I believe that the cell phone is going to go towards less traditional input methods.<p>I have a ""smartphone"". And it's too complex to use, because it is trying to use a PC windowing system on an embedded device. It has menus and tabs and lists - those things don't work simply because the screen is too small.<p>The iphone works to a large part because there is a lot of thought put in the user interface. The human-machine interaction.<p>Other companies are seeing this, and they will start innovating, no longer in the hardware, but in the software. That's when we'll see the new cell phone features I expect:<p>1. Multitouch\n2. Squeezing\n3. Voice recognition\n4. Context sensitive UIs\n5. Motion detectors that do something depending on how phone. Example - phone in pocket, everything is off. You take it out and look at it, it shows you date, calls, etc. You start playing with it, it figures out what you likely do\n6. Entire surface of phone interface<p>Till people start working on the UI, the phone is stuck. When the UI changes, things will become massive with the phone.<p>That's why google is going Android. They know where the future OS is.",1210863065
190526,comment,190295,190501,0,0,hhm,,,"I don't agree. You can explain why something is true, right? (at least in some cases, not for all cases, you know, GÃ¶del and all that). In such cases you can actually explain, it follows that if X is true, !X isn't true, and you have an obvious explaination for that.<p>Example: why is my shirt red? Because I only have red shirts on my house. Why isn't my shirt blue? Please refer to the previous explaination of why it's red, then it follows it can't be at the same time red and blue, etc etc.<p>And it's great it's like this, because otherwise we could be saying a lot of random predicates are false and no one could argue with us. So I think asking someone ""why x is false"" isn't illogical, after all if there is a reason to say ""x is false"", surely there is a way to prove it's false indeed.<p>Edit: part of the problem with this discussion, of course, is that there is not a fixed meaning for ""why"". ""Why"" is a very ambiguous question, it doesn't specify whether we want to know the intention, the proof, the cause, etc. And even, what is a cause? If you are talking about historic events indeed you can't explain why X didn't happen, but from the same pov you couldn't ever explain why Y did happen at all, if you see history as something deterministic & linear. So whether you're right or wrong actually depends on what you see on the word why...",1210863016

In the past few weeks, I have come to the realization that I, too, would like to ""learn how to hack."" Here's the problem: Not having an extensive technical background, this piece of advice seems to be quite vague. With which languages should one start in order to learn to hack? \n   I sent a similar version of this question to PG about a month back and he referred me to the creators of Appjet, a YC startup he said was working on this very problem. After looking at the site and receiving an email from one of the founders, the answer I gleaned was to start with learning Javascript. I would like to know from this community whether I'm on the right track to ""learning to hack.""",1210862234

190504,comment,190295,190295,0,0,gruseom,,,"I'm tired of this incessant chatter about libraries, libraries, libraries in discussions about language. Of course libraries matter; I don't want to write code to convert a bitmap to jpeg. But the ""libraries are the new language"" belief is a gross exaggeration that has become way too commonplace. If it were true, we'd all be programming in C.<p>Programmers are not welders. Programming means writing new code. Language is the medium of that code, it is hugely important, and it gets <i>more</i> important as the complexity of one's problem increases. The only way that libraries would become more important than language is if programmers stopped working on complex problems or new problems.<p>Ultimately, this overemphasis on libraries is a variation of the discredited ""code reuse"" meme, in which programs are imagined to be strung out of components, so all you need is enough components.<p>Edit: Another common thing about these discussions is otherwise intelligent people ignoring the fact that it is possible for a program written in one language to call a library written in another.",1210861517

Maybe my prof knew how to setup his assignment for maximum frustration using SML, and normal usage is not so bad (after you gain some skill in it), I don't know.  But consensus from my class & some people on the net is that it shouldn't take hours to get a 10 line program working.  Principle of least surprise is something SML does not follow.   Also there's a lack of a support network & decent documentation for it compared to more popular languages out there.  I'd rather use lisp than the traumatic experience SML was.

Since the original Xbox was hacked and broadband became commonplace, I have watched less and less TV. I watch anything I want to on my AppleTV. Youtube, iTunes and Boxee are an incredibly disruptive combination. Our TV has an FTA digital tuner built in, which died two months ago. We haven't replaced it, we just watch TV even less. When the switchover happens we probably won't bother at all.<p>For me, Boxee is the most disruptive offering I've seen and it's precisely a combination of the social and Internet-based elements that makes me try to convince everyone I know to use it. I don't see Boxee killing TV, but like XBMC before it, it's one hell of a disruptive concept.<p>I also agree that some sort of set top box combining telephony, TV, Radio and Internet will displace regular TV. Cable and telephony companies have already been moving towards this with 'triple play' offerings.<p>I on the other hand have had this kind of integration since 2003 with MythTV.",1236110033
501865,comment,501351,501351,0,0,ewiethoff,,,"Liked the show? Maybe it was the <i>old</i> commercials. The ""Taxi"" and ""Happy Days"" research appears to fail to distinguish between a program being interrupted by today's commercials versus yesteryear's commercials. Many people delight in old ads, whether they be newspaper ads, magazine ads, movie posters, or whatnot, because they're history. They show us the changes in design esthetics, cultural values & propaganda, fashion, and so on. (I happen to be keen on fonts and women's eyebrow styles.) That's why such things have value as collectibles. I can't help picturing the research subjects smirking at the ""bad"" ties worn by the Michael Brownstein lawyers.<p>Liked the show? Maybe it was the pacing of the program for commercial interruption. TV ads are not injected at random intervals. They're injected between scenes. But not just any scenes. They're injected after scenes which were written to be followed by a commercial break. In other words, the TV show was designed to be enjoyed with the breaks. For example, contrast made-for-TV movies (designed for breaks) with made-for-theater movies (designed for continuous viewing). Watch an adless video of a made-for-TV movie, and you can see the story build to a little climax every few minutes, and more frequent climaxes as the story progresses. The ever-increasing climaxes get so tiresome, in my taste, that they cry out for interruption.",1236110031

Indeed it had great impact in getting people to sign up for Internet access and connect a computer to the Internet in the first place. I discovered online interaction in 1992, when I attended a conference about homeschooling in Washington state and saw a demonstration of the Prodigy online service there. I made sure to connect a modem to my computer (remember dial-up?) and soon entered into interesting conversations with people all over the country about a common topic of interest. None of the content I was reading was produced by professionals--it was all parents talking to other parents. My online interaction completely displaced TV from my life, and soon greatly reduced the number of postal letters I sent to friends, because I could reach most of my best friends online anyway.<p>Sometime a while later in the 1990s, I saw an analysis in an industry magazine about whether the main application of the Internet would be broadcasting of professionally produced content or point-to-point communication. That analysis pointed out that at that time the revenues of the Baby Bell companies were MANY times greater than the revenues of all the movie and TV production companies. Point-to-point is where the revenue streams are. Broadcasting doesn't draw in as much money, because it doesn't appeal to as many audience members in as many ways.<p>My use of television now consists just about entirely of watching the local TV news and one network news program broadcast to my home with my children. We don't watch any dramas, and only occasionally watch Saturday Night Live's opening segment. (We don't subscribe to cable and live in an area with an unwatchable digital signal, so we resort to just one analog broadcast signal at the moment.) TV is expendable in our house.

TV viewership may indeed plummet in the future, but as of right now its at an all time high.<p>Then, I can't help but notice that I still procure my internet from my cable provider.  And that same cable provider is not only actively fighting against network neutrality, but they are also blocking my ability to download anything from Torrent.  They are far from beaten.<p>Lastly, what is the real difference between watching shows on my TV verse Computer.  They are both using digital pipes, they both have microprocessors, memory and HDs - one has a bigger screen than the other (usually).  The only real difference, and increasingly so, is that one is proprietary, and one is open.  TV has not lost.. their content is (unfortunately) as relevant and abundant to the average American as ever.<p>All TV has lost is utter dominance - much like MS windows lost its utter dominance with the adoption of Linux and the rise of OSX (but they are still #1 by a lot).  However, whether its piped through a monitor or an HD flatscreen, the US consumer will continue to glue their eyeballs to the content we call TV today for some time before open content can even begin to realize the same advertising dollars as the proprietary networks do.",1236108347

We hoped to then sell this service to data-intensive industries. Decided it wasn't feasible.<p>We need to consider cpu cycles gained from this regime vs. bandwidth and cpu cycles lost from the hundreds of web, queue, data servers needed to run this model. IMO it is unlikely that this model will pay off once you consider things like network latency, and trade-offs like job size (higher job size is better) vs. job completion probability (lower job size is better).<p>Even if the potential for viability were there, it isn't clear that there is a market for something like this.

Scrum says: the product owner says what they want, the team decides how much they can deliver in a month, then they go off and do it <i>however the hell they choose</i>. After a month they come back and demonstrate what they got done, <i>in the form of working software and only working software</i>. The stakeholders then get to decide whether they like the progress that's been made and whether or not to continue for another month. Nobody gets to interrupt the team while they're working and nobody gets to tell the team how to do their work. That's the heart of Scrum. You can see it's much closer to the opposite of how you described it.<p>But then I noticed that you were merely responding to this, which is obviously where the wrong idea came from:<p><i>The development team is run by a project manager. His role is to move the top priority user stories from product backlog to the sprint backlog and break them in atomic tasks that are distributed to your developers</i><p>This is risible.

501795,comment,501696,501696,0,0,9oliYQjP,,,"My brother writes for TV. There is quite an age difference between us; he's older. The industry still does not fully comprehend the Internet as it relates to its future. The other day we were having dinner and my brother said he wishes he could just cut the middlemen (the producers/networks) out of the equation and become a distributor on the Internet himself. He's tired of being creatively limited by their vision -- or lack-there-of.<p>He was surprised when I said that it was well within his ability to do this already. Not in a ""woohoo I put up my own website with my own shows"" kind of way, but in a ""I have become my own virtual CDN via EC2 et al"" kind of way. He argued that would simply make Amazon and the infrastructure providers into the new middlemen. Perhaps, though that might be like saying that my computer use is being held hostage by the electrical company. In theory it is, but in practice it does not feel like the very exploitive sort of middle management that exists in the entertainment industry.<p>I've done some work for this industry and the key point you have to understand is that, whereas ""Can we accomplish this?"" is a matter of technological feasibility to us hackers, it means something entirely different to entertainment industry folks. To them, it is more of a legal matter. The whole industry is mired in a complex web of contracts governing every detailed aspect of intellectual property. So, when we scoff at how long it took the networks to get something like Hulu up on the Internet, understand it was a bunch of lawyers holding up the process. Then, when you get around some of the service's limitations (e.g., geoblocking) understand that too, was a dumb legal requirement. Everyone involved knows these restrictions are circumventable but, they must be in place for the existing contracts not to have to be re-negotiated.<p>Talk to anyone that's worked on the iTunes infrastructure. From what I gather, at least initially, getting an album onto the iTMS involved dozens of contracts. It made getting an iPhone application onto the App Store a cakewalk in comparison.<p>Where a startup could provide tremendous value, it would be in overcoming the legal hurdles to distributing content on the Internet. Spend the money on the lawyers to setup all the contracts that you need, so you can get unsigned artists onto your content distribution network, but more-or-less play by the rules of the current industry. These people are afraid of change, so you don't want to come out of left field in the way you operate. Then, when you become the new boss of the industry, tear down the stupid legal constraints that stifle creativity and innovation, and makes the Internet pretend to be something it is not.<p>The networks are vulnerable. Writers, actors, and other workers hate working for them because they take huge cuts of revenue and then play accounting games to take an even larger portion. There's a reason the unions there are so strong. They're united in their hatred of the middlemen. On the other side of the coin, us consumers hate the networks too. Most of us are tired of their antics.<p>So, any startup willing to take on this challenge would have a friendly set of content suppliers, and a captive audience. Just get yourself the best lawyers you can probably find, because you will need them ;)",1236107229

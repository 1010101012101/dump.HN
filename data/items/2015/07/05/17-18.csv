Mainstream OS&#x27;s don&#x27;t use them. People adding beauty to their apps on such OS&#x27;s also add attack surface in most cases. So, people wanting easy-to-use, secure communications must accept simpler interfaces or maybe text-interfaces depending on their threat profile.<p>I&#x27;ll agree the interface needs to be easy to use regardless of how it&#x27;s implemented. Most tools that aren&#x27;t got that way due to lack of solid effort into UX. They can certainly do better. Yet, the result might look like a console IRC client or an old Win32 GUI app if it uses simplest stuff for security. Will users embrace that? Unlikely & didn&#x27;t for many commercial products in this space. It&#x27;s why the person you replied to is right: they won&#x27;t make the smallest sacrifices to solve their greatest problems.<p>Has always been the case.

9834272,comment,9833994,9833994,0,0,vitovito,,,"Hi, I&#x27;m a designer and a researcher, and I consult with startups on a regular basis.<p>If your &quot;team is all done to kick off,&quot; then I assume there&#x27;s a stack of documentation that defines who your customer is, the market size, the segmentation, their problems, their mental models, competitive solutions, the things they look for in solutions, etc.  That&#x27;s market research; it&#x27;s not your assumptions.  I also assume there&#x27;s a database of potential customer contacts, ready to be called in for focus groups, to shadow, to do interviews with, and to test designs.  That&#x27;s customer development.<p>If there aren&#x27;t those things, you&#x27;re not &quot;all done to kick off&quot; yet.<p>Also,<p>> How do you make sure that the user experience is what it needs to be?<p>is a different question than<p>> How do you start the process that you come up with such interesting interfaces.<p>I&#x27;ll answer them in that order.<p>For any product, you make sure the user experience is what it needs to be by making it for the user.  That&#x27;s it.  Yes, coming up with a solution can be a creative act (although it doesn&#x27;t have to be), but if you can&#x27;t prove it solves your users&#x27; problems, you made art, not a design.<p>So you &quot;get out of the building.&quot;  Go find your potential users and understand the problems they have, and the processes they currently experience those problems within.  Understand where your potential solution fits into that existing process and their existing mindset and their existing worldview.  Make sure they&#x27;re willing to pay for a solution to that problem in that context.<p>Then, listen to them.  Design your thing, and bring it back to them to test it, using paper prototypes or an interactive simulation or whatever.  Watch how they use and react to it.  You&#x27;re not testing the users; you&#x27;re testing your assumptions and your arrogance.  Fix the problems, and then test it again.  Every time you think you&#x27;ve &quot;got it,&quot; test it again.  You only have a solution when it performs the way you (originally, sixteen iterations ago) expect it to with the users.  You never make a change and then assume you&#x27;ve sorted it.<p>By the time you&#x27;ve done all that, you don&#x27;t have an &quot;interesting&quot; interface any more.  You have a usable one.  It probably looks pretty boring.  It probably works using standard OS controls, or perhaps similarly to their current system but with some efficiency improvements.<p>That&#x27;s because your goal isn&#x27;t &quot;interesting.&quot;  You&#x27;re not making a design to impress other designers, or to create something novel, or to challenge your developers.  You&#x27;re making a design to solve a problem for a person that isn&#x27;t you.<p>This is why my &quot;design&quot; process starts with creating as little as new as possible.  I do a bunch of background research to see what other solutions have preceded me.  I look to other industries and other, unrelated products to see what other solutions have similar workflows or inputs or outputs.  I know that without testing, any potential solution is as good as any other potential solution.  Let&#x27;s find out how these other solutions perform first.  If nothing does the way we want it to, okay, now I&#x27;ll start coming up with something original and testing that.  But maybe some existing thing is perfectly adequate.  Great.  Look at all the time and money and creative effort we saved.  I don&#x27;t feel like I was cheated out of doing great work because this isn&#x27;t art.  I&#x27;m not painting a masterpiece.  I&#x27;m solving a problem for someone else, and it got solved.<p>> I&#x27;m sure asking this here on HN will help me learn/move fast.<p>Market research and customer development can be two of the slowest processes in business.  That&#x27;s why most people on HN skip them and go right to code, but then wonder why their product turns out to be terrible.  Finding and then recruiting potential customers for your first focus group can take weeks or months.  But, you can&#x27;t build the right thing for your customers if you don&#x27;t know who they are or why you&#x27;re building it for them.  In this, there are no silver bullets, only lead bullets.  There&#x27;s nothing to do but all of the work.",1436118894

I think the goal of an article like this should be to give a high-level intuitive explanation for some technical result, rather than sounding smart or complicated.<p>First, it is a little weird to me to talk about &quot;old-school ML&quot; as learning maps from inputs to hidden features. That seems neither old, nor very representative of the field of Machine Learning as a whole. It&#x27;s also weird to say that RBMs and other deep learning algorithms are formulated using classical statistical mechanics. Moreover, implying that this scary-sounding formulation is the reason they are interesting seems like an attempt at sounding smart. Typically there are many ways to motivate and derive different algorithms, and it is /useful/ to acknowledge the multiple viewpoints because they often give different insights.<p>Second, the section about flow maps and fixed points seems to make a mess out of the notation by either being unclear or disagreeing with standard notation. What is meant by the notation &quot;f(X) -> X&quot;? Presumably this means something like f is a function that maps elements of the set X to elements in the set X. More standard notation for this would be something like &quot;f: X -> X&quot;. Perhaps it means that the image of the set X under the function f is again the set X. But does that require that f be a surjective function? Confusingly, it also looks like the function f might be required to be the identity function, but given the context this is clearly not the intended interpretation.<p>When defining the fixed point, it seems that it would be more natural to say that x is a fixed point of f if f(x) = x. That is, x is fixed or unmoved by the function f. It turns out that for contractions (and some other functions, too), that the sequence f(x), f(f(x)), f(f(f(x))), and so on is guaranteed to converge to a unique fixed point of f. The notation f^n typically refers to the function f being applied n times, which is not the usage in the article. In the article, f^1, f^2, and so on are all identical copies of the function f. Using the standard notation, the definition of f_infty would be f_infty(x) = lim_{n -> infty} f^n(x). And, in the case of a contraction, the Banach fixed point theorem gives that f_infty is well-defined, and there exists a unique x_fix in X so that f_infty(x) = x_fix for all x in X (i.e., iterating f repeatedly converges to a unique fixed point x_fix of the function f).<p>These things do not necessarily mean that the article is uninteresting or uninformative or even technically incorrect. But if the author didn&#x27;t take the time to make the simple things clear, then I&#x27;m not sure that I want to read the rest.<p>Sorry for the rant.",1436117359

One trick it claimed to teach was meditation that taught people to control perception of time. The idea was that you could slow time down to have more reaction, training or thinking time. I wrote it off as a snake oil thing with far-fetched possibility of happing to some degree somewhere else.<p>Seeing these cases makes me wonder, though. Research into neuroscience or neuro-engineering might be able to tap into this effect to do things similar to other claim. My first thought as a former martial artist was combat applications. There&#x27;s gotta be a DARPA lab working on this exact thing somewhere.<p>So, applicable questions to this are (a) does their brain just slow down where it takes time to catch up to what happened in reality; or (b) do our brains actually waste effort to preserve a specific, temporal experience. If it&#x27;s (b), then there&#x27;s a possibility of re-training or modifying the brain to get more usable time to think or act. I can&#x27;t be sure from the article if it&#x27;s (b), though.

The person I got this advice from wasn&#x27;t a nutritionist, wasn&#x27;t a doctor, had no specific medical training, and didn&#x27;t tell me what to expect or what was likely to happen.  (The circumstances were weird, let&#x27;s just put at that.)<p>I grumbled but said I&#x27;d give a try, with no expectation about what would happen.  I bought a bunch of gluten-free varieties of foods and spent a week eating gluten-free bread, supplementing meals with rice instead of pasta, etc.  My grain intake didn&#x27;t change, just how much of it was wheat-based.<p>Within a few days, I realized that 1)  I&#x27;d been experiencing bloated feelings in my belly for <i>years</i>, now gone.  2)  I suddenly had a <i>lot</i> more energy.  3)  Various of my minor joint pains (which I&#x27;d chalked up to &quot;well, I&#x27;m getting old&quot;) went away.<p>So I stuck with it.<p>Within a month, I realized I&#x27;d lost about 10 pounds--again, no less grains, just less wheat.<p>After a year, I noticed that I wasn&#x27;t getting sick any longer.  I used to get pretty bad colds a couple times a year.  That has now stopped.<p>Several years later, I feel like I did in my 20s, despite being near 40.<p>Would I go back to eating wheat regularly?  Nope.  I&#x27;ve tried, I get bloated for a few days after a big ol&#x27; slice of pizza, and if I slack off and eat lots of wheat for a few days straight, I&#x27;ll start to get the scratchy-throat-feeling that I used to get when I&#x27;d get one of my regular colds.<p>Again, no one told me to have any expectations about going gluten-free.  I didn&#x27;t even know &quot;gluten-free&quot; was a diet--this was years before it became a fad diet--except for my celiac friend who couldn&#x27;t eat wheat (poor thing, I used to think.)  I certainly didn&#x27;t have any idea what it would do for me.<p>So when these articles come out that say non-celiac gluten intolerance is bunk, I think, well, fine, but something went on with me, and it doesn&#x27;t add up that it&#x27;s all in my head.",1436116383

I had a simple surgery a year ago(shoulder arthroscopy), and I specifically said that I don&#x27;t agree to general anesthesia or any kind of sedatives, because even a small probability of a small brain damage isn&#x27;t worth it for me.<p>Doctors tried to push me into accepting the general anesthesia, saying that it&#x27;s the only option(and that we lose brain cells every day really, so who cares).  I went to a different clinic where a doctor agreed to do the surgery under local anesthetics and without sedation without any problems. Said someting along the lines &quot;don&#x27;t worry, man, your brain is gonna be fine.&quot;<p>He failed to mention that local anesthesia can also lead to neurotoxicity, and I was too ignorant to know about it(for some reason I assumed that local anesthetics are harmless, and didn&#x27;t do my research).<p>During the surgery I felt the symptomps(dizziness, difficulty speaking), consistent with neurotoxicity caused by local anesthetics.<p>I don&#x27;t notice any permanent damage, though I doubt that I&#x27;d be able to tell. 6 months after the surgery I have developed tinnitus, but I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s connected to it or not.<p>Anyway, my point is that no way in hell would I agree to the surgery if I&#x27;d have known the risks.<p>Also, before that, doctors pushed me into unnecessarily taking general anesthesia for a routine procedure. They convinced me that it can&#x27;t be harmful, and I was too young and socially awkward to ask more questions or argue.<p>I also fear dental anesthetics. There is research indicating that they can cause neurotoxocity. I can easily sit through filling regular cavities(with a dental laser it really isn&#x27;t that painful), but I&#x27;m not sure what I would do if I have to get root canal. I would take any option over anesthesia, but I don&#x27;t know of any alternative.<p>Some doctors say that it&#x27;s just an irrational fear. But given that there&#x27;s some research saying that even dental anesthesia can cause neurotixicity, I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s so irrational about not wanting my brain cells to die. My brain is what matters to me the most in the world, far more than anything else, it has infinite value, because that&#x27;s literally &quot;me&quot;, so even small chance of small damage is worth avoiding at all cost(in my value system).<p>It&#x27;s infuriating how casual doctors are about such risks, especially in cases when they can be avoided. I understand taking necessary risks when it&#x27;s a life-saving surgery, but when you have alternatives, I think patient should be able to make an informed choice.",1436116327

She knows she&#x27;s been the cause of this poor guys life being messed up.  Well, the idiots in the prosecutors office and the judge are the actual cause, but she must feel some guilt.<p>What a shame, her first sexual experience at a young age gets mixed up with feelings of guilt and shame.",1436115990

But at root it is a heart-disease death. Same for cancer.<p>Some of the <i>highlighted</i> examples from the abstracts are extreme:<p>>>><p>One example of a lethal error of communication between provider and patient occurred when cardiologists failed to warn their 19-year-old patient not to run. The patient had experienced syncope [fainting] while running, and 5 days of inpatient, diagnostic testing were inconclusive; however, his cardiologists knew he was not ready to return to running but failed to warn him against this risk. Having not been warned against running, he resumed running and died 3 weeks later while running.<p><<<<p>The proper analysis is &quot;what are your odds of survival when you choose to seek vs not seek care?&quot;",1436115965

Unlike Microsoft Engineering, Microsoft Research is pretty kick-ass. Truth be told, much of what they do copies other work in some way and tries to improve on it. Example: VerveOS&#x27;s Nucleus copied the old IME mainframes with a central component called Nucleus with similar features. They pretend like they were original cuz everyone forgets about the old systems. ;) Yet, their copying that approach to split development and verification was a <i>really smart move</i>. It&#x27;s how they got results.<p>I encouraged Microsoft Research to continue investing in tooling and verification tech that represents The Right Thing approach to systems. That pieces of it drift to their commercial products is even better. :)",1436115639

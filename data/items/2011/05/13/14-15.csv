2544843,comment,2544380,2544473,3,0,Jebdm,,,"I mostly prefer text-based conversation.  You have more time to respond, there's usually less filler, text creates an extremely convenient/useful record automatically, it is easier to return to past topics, it is easier to communicate bigger/more complex ideas, and (for me) reading is quicker than listening.<p>The only real disadvantages are that typing is a little slower (I type around 90 WPM but speak around 150 WPM) and that you don't get body language cues in writing.  For the sorts of things I am interested in, though, I actually prefer not having body language.  Body language makes us try to react to others by guessing their mental states from some subtle changes in their shape.  This is problematic for two reasons; first of all, this sort of guessing is inherently imperfect, but more importantly, we tend to be quite heavily influenced by our perceptions of others' reactions.  (This makes sense, evolutionarily; it is a way of making us cooperate and preventing us from diverging too much.)<p>What this means for conversation is that topics are chosen, opinions are suppressed, and minds are changed purely on the basis of our faulty readings of others' opinions.  This is especially problematic when talking about abstract ideas because subconscious emotional reaction is an awful predictor of the merit or validity of ideas.  The problem is compounded because we are very bad at simply setting aside our reactions, especially in social contexts.<p>Body language heuristics are obviously good for some things.  They help us negotiate relationships, know when others are upset, and interpret ambiguity.  But they also give us false impressions and lead to socio-cognitive biases.  Furthermore, a large proportion of the benefits of body language come from dealing with problems of face-to-face interaction between primates, meaning that the benefits are less when dealing with textual communication (and especially communication about abstract ideas).<p>Even small talk over IM seems to be more stimulating to me on average than face-to-face small talk.  I have observed this not only in my own interactions but in watching the interactions of others as well.  My sample could be biased, because I am obviously a nerd who mostly hangs out with other nerds, but I think I've seen enough ""normal"" people to make a general statement.  Your mileage may vary if you have different tastes in conversation than I do.  But if you prefer to talk about the abstract or the complex, or if you try to avoid cognitive biases, then the only way I can imagine face-to-face conversation being generally preferable is if it has a strong instinctive appeal to you.<p>A lot of people do seem to have this innate preference.  The same people often seem to prefer reading on paper than on screens.  Some of them say their preference is based off of eye strain--which might even be a reason to prefer speech over text--but for a lot of people the reason seems to be more aesthetic.",1305298560

Rules falling within that standard are important for clarity, and rules outside that standard are needless and fussy. However...<p><i>You should never end a sentence with a preposition.</i><p>I like to follow this one, but only as a hobby, and not in casual conversation unless I'm talking to another pedant. I do admit that the syntactical knots into which I sometimes need to tie myself in order to avoid the preposition at the end make the sentence harder rather than easier to parse. On the other hand, sometimes prepositions at the end can make sentences harder to understand, in instances where the sentence seems to have a different meaning until you get to the preposition at the end. (I can't think of any examples right now.)<p><i>You should never split an infinitive</i><p>Agreed, that's just plain random.<p><i>Never use the passive voice</i><p>I have never heard this from anyone except Microsoft Word Grammar Check.<p><i>Don't start sentences with 'but' or 'and' or 'however'.</i><p>Now now, here I'm really going to have to disagree with you. ""However"" is reasonable, but ""and"" and ""but"" really belong in the middle of the sentence, not at the beginning.

This is typically union and employees are trained via schooling and apprenticeships provided by the union itself.<p>In general, the union/new construction side makes more money, but, it's harder to get into the union and you generally work less hours (and make less money) until you are a fairly senior person.

In effect they are trained to produce fast food.

You'd want them to know the rules, and be familiar with them, but not be chained to them/use them as a crutch or excuse.

They aren't better than a person that can assemble words into sentences with the regularity of a automated assembly line, but they are definitely different.<p>Where it gets confusing is knowing the difference between somebody who purposely ignores the rules to achieve a desired output vs. somebody who is completely ignorant of the rules.

In developed economies, nationalization has historically occurred when a business that the public relies upon has become literally or effectively bankrupt. Can you think of an example of an inefficient nationalized industry in the UK, the EU, or the USA? And in what way has nationalization contributed to that inefficiency?<p>In many cases the services that have recently been privatized were never nationalized to begin with - they were public services, like garbage collection or public transport, that have no obvious market competition model to follow.<p>Your definition of ""rent-seeking"" is also incorrect. Rent-seeking behaviour is when an economic agent attempts to manipulate public policy for private gain. A government body cannot engage in this behaviour by definition, as it does not take a profit, and is not private. It can fight its corner though - seeking more funding - but then it must spend that money on things like schoolbooks or hospital beds. This is considered a horrifying waste of resources to the private sector, which knows that those funds could better be spent on yachts and hookers.",1305297739

One man's idea does not preclude another from making his own; there is no scarcity of ideas or expressions. So there is no reason to not make an expression the exclusive property of the author; nobody else is limited in their freedoms because if the original creator would not have made the expression, it wouldn't have existed in the first place.

Freedom to do something only goes so far as long as that something doesn't infringe on someone else's freedom; of course my right to not be tortured infringes on your freedom to torture me. In other words, one freedom is always the other side of the coin of the prohibition of someone else to infringe on that freedom. I don't see how you can reasonably argue that freedom doesn't exist, because its very nature is that it is a protection against someone else's actions (those that infringe on the freedom being protected).<p>Besides, in your specific example it's not even telling others what they can do with <i>their</i> property; it's telling others (or rather, putting conditions on that that person can then choose to accept or reject) what to do with <i>your</i> property.<p>""The only reasonable argument for IP is the orthodox economic one of supporting and sustaining a market.""<p>No it is not, and that's my whole point. For someone to own the expression of his or her ideas is perfectly reasonable and broadly accepted; and not (only) for utilitarian reasons, but also for fundamental moral ownership reasons. Which is why so many people feel wronged when a picture they took is used by someone else without attribution - a very common pattern, judging from the amount of blog posts about it.<p>Expressions of ideas represent the work of a creator just as much as a vase made by a pottery maker represents the work of that maker, and just like that maker is entitled to the ownership of the result of his labor, and any potential economic benefit he can gain from it, so are the creators and expressors (I think I'm just making up that word) of ideas.

He was a chemist. He touch mathematics in college. He threw discus in college track and field. His home was filled with books on chemistry, math, history, physics, geography. I grew up surrounded by stacks of OMNI, National Geographic, Discovery, Popular Science, Popular Mechanics and plenty of other great reads. And for a living, he chose to build houses. He became a general contractor who didn't really contract out that much work. He did almost everything himself, except pour foundations and wire the homes. He built beautiful homes that often took two to four years and cost a few million dollars (and some people hired him more than once to build their homes over the decades as their tastes evolved). He just loved building stuff and working outside and he did it his entire life. I was also fortunate to spend many years of my childhood going onto his job-site with him day after day and goofing around, helping, watching.

I'll provide some such details for the curious, though.<p>Technically, malloc() is not a system call; it is a library function that calls either brk()/sbrk() or mmap() (or just uses memory it already ""has"").  The choice depends on the situation and just what it's doing.<p>mmap() engages the VM subsystem, backing a chunk of RAM with part of a given file on disk (in this case with a special flag to not actually do that, but just give the RAM).  Of course this will never require actual RAM until you go to use it:  that's the whole point of the call.  Normally mmap() will not cause OOM issues, because it creates exactly as much virtual memory out of thin air as it requests physical memory.  That's not true in this usage, though.  I suppose in this usage, it could block off a chunk of virtual memory.<p>brk() and sbrk() are the more ""normal"" ways to get extra memory, by expanding the heap.  The new memory must be initialized manually (or not, as the runtime prefers).  The main reason to not do this all the time is that the heap itself must be contiguous.  Using mmap() lets malloc() return pages to the system under more varied conditions and work around parts of the address space that contain other things[1].<p>Calls to mmap()/brk()/sbrk() are rather expensive compared to malloc() calls.  They are system calls, after all. That's why programs will normally ask for more memory than they actually need at the moment:  it reduces the amortized runtime cost of malloc().  Linux tries to take advantage of this.<p>So, the strange Linux behavior is that if a process calls mmap()/brk()/sbrk() (and doesn't hit the addressable limit) Linux will simply record that the process has requested mapping of a particular region of memory.  Then, later, the VM subsystem hands out the memory when the process tries to do something to it.  The question is, what to do if there isn't any memory to hand out?<p>There's no way to cause an arbitrary memory access to fail with ENOMEM, so Linux has this hacky workaround where it semi-arbitrarily selects and kills something.<p>The historical way to avoid this was to have a huge amount of virtual memory, hence the suggestions like ""twice the amount of RAM in the system"".  The system would become unusably slow before the OOM killer would engage, and the user would manually kill some relatively unimportant processes.<p>[1]- In older versions of the Linux kernel, the program code would be stored in memory about 1G away from the heap.  So, as soon as you used about 1G, you'd run into your code and malloc() would no longer be able to brk() for more memory.",1305296137

However, where we disagree is that you seem to believe that all future events have an equivalent uncertainty, but this is demonstrably false.<p>There is a implicit probability associated with all future events, and these probabilities, in the aggregate, will impact today's share price.

Tractors drive themselves (what google is only now doing with cars).<p>The tractor, the planter, everything is gps and sensor based.

Also they shut off if you cross over a planted area so you don't waste seed, fertilizer, etc.<p>Farmers aren't waiting for you to come along and ""get tech involved"".  They've (the smart succesful ones) always have the latest tech.  From satelite internet (way back when) to spreadsheets to highly sophisticated computerized machines.<p>Inputs (fuel, seed, fertilizer) are ridiculously expensive (b/c our dollar is worth less and less and the fed prints money like toilet paper) and at least fuel and fertilizer have many foreign components.

So for words where the ""h"" is pronounced, you treat it as a consonant and lead with ""a"": ""go for a hike."" Whereas for words where ""h"" is silent, so pronunciation thus leads with a vowel, you lead with ""an"": ""it would be an honor.""<p>""Historic"" is pronounced differently, mostly based on region. You can go to ""a historic occasion,"" with hard H, or ""an 'istoric occasion,"" with a soft one.<p>Or, for native speakers: type what you'd pronounce.",1305295336

We do need to get away from relying on browser vendors to spec and implement everything correctly, because with such a massive surface like they're targeting they won't. We do need to push this responsibility out to the edges. We need to drastically reduce the standard API and move the functionality from high level (as in IndexedDB) to low level (as in POSIX).

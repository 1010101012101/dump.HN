6846821,comment,6846639,6846639,13,0,err4nt,,,"I have heard that large publishers, like Time magazine, will commission artists to create covers for multiple stories. They may have up to 5 tentative cover designs for any publication, then they are free to choose (right up until press time) which fully-designed cover they wish to run.<p>The thing is - they PAY for each cover they commission whether they use it or not.<p>----<p>My career began in graphic design. Many people try to get you to submit work and only the winner gets paid (or paid in full). I&#x27;ve had other &#x27;take home assignments&#x27; or interview tests that they tell me to block off half a day so they can &#x27;see my work&#x27; to &#x27;tell if I&#x27;m a good fit&#x27;.<p>Don&#x27;t be fooled by any of it - <i>good work != good workers</i>, and it&#x27;s much more valuable that they see how you work on their team than how well you perform in skills that can be taught.<p>I quickly made a simple rule: I do the work; I get paid.<p>@Hiring managers: If you want to see a sample of my work, and my past portfolio isn&#x27;t good enough for you - pay me for a small freelance project before offering me a contract. It&#x27;s low-risk, everybody gets paid and is happy, and if you don&#x27;t like what you see, don&#x27;t give me more work. It&#x27;s very simple. Anything less is criminal (where I live).<p>@Devs: Only have two prices: <i>Pro</i>, and <i>Pro Bono</i>. Nothing in-between.<p><i>Pro</i> means there&#x27;s no such thing as family discount, or friend discount, or a &#x27;deal&#x27; on things. If the person knows you and wants you to be successful in life the last thing they&#x27;ll ask you to do is work for less profit. See those selfish people for what they are. You should be happy to pay full price for anything, and it just makes it <i>better</i> if you&#x27;re able to support somebody you know while paying full price.<p><i>Pro bono</i> means it&#x27;s $0.00. You should always have at least one project on your table that you are donating your time back to the community. Ever use Firefox or Chrome? Linux? OS X? Android? You already understand the benefits of pro bono work in the open-source software community, but as a worker maybe there are ways you can give back to the community you live in as well. Find people who need your skill set and make a habit of learning new things while helping others.<p>If you don&#x27;t do any pro bono work, it&#x27;s easy to get caught in the &#x27;discount delusion&#x27; and you end up trying to give up all your profit instead. Do pro bono, and then insist on the full (fair) price for everything else.",1386165405

6846738,comment,6846371,6846371,7,0,smizell,,,"The big benefit the author is describing comes from content negotiation and hypermedia types. The idea behind content negotiation is that a client and a server should decide and agree upon the media type that will be used in the communication without any human intervention (even a developer). This is accomplished with the Accept header, where the client tells the server, &quot;Here are the media types that I understand.&quot; Most times, we developers use the Accept header as &quot;Here is the media type I want you to send me.&quot; If we use the former, the server will figure out what media type to send based on the clients acceptances and preferences.<p>Here&#x27;s the great thing about it. If APIs are built this way, and if clients are built to read and understand common and registered hypermedia types, there could be a time where clients and servers are able to communicate in such a way that the media type becomes seemingly invisible to the developer. We see this with the most popular REST client/server combo, the browser and the web server that serves up HTML. As the user, you can traverse the RESTful HTML API that websites have while the media type, HTML, is mostly concealed to the user. In other words, there is a chance that a good number of HTML websites are more RESTful than most of the APIs we see today.<p>In reducing REST to simply RPC over the web and skipping over the ideas of content negotiation and hypermedia types, we are missing out on the genius behind how the web was designed to be used. The author is really wanting us to go back to that instead of progressing toward the current patterns of fracturing your resources into separate APIs.",1386164301

Even as a human, I&#x27;ve wished that I had more than 2 hands, eyes in the back of my head, or simply a much greater range of motion in the ability to turn my waist and neck and other joints.<p>Seems to me that making robots look human is purely cosmetic and emotional, but limiting in functionality unless their function is to interact with humans.",1386163937

(myself included)[0].<p>The only tricky part with this approach for small-scale sites is getting authentication right.  REST architecture is fundamentally stateless, which means it&#x27;s tricky to implement a &quot;Remember Me&quot; checkbox.  The simplest way around this (which does involve saving state server-side on the DB) is to issue a nonce once the user authenticates via whatever means you want, and then using that nonce to authenticate each request until the user logs out or a specific period of time passes.<p>All of this assumes you&#x27;re serving everything over HTTPS, of course.<p>Anyway, if you do it right, it&#x27;s no less difficult to maintain than anything else.  Since all of your DOM interactions are client-side, this means you end up with a large JS application, but tooling is getting better, and JS isn&#x27;t a bad language to work in (however, I am actively looking into both Dart and Typescript as more robust alternatives).<p>0. <a href=\"http://www.leaseweblabs.com/2013/10/api-first-architecture-fat-vs-thin-server-debate/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.leaseweblabs.com/2013/10/api-first-architecture-f...</a>",1386163864

Appealing to morality is naive. So is running around trying to plug the holes in our laws and tweak incentives. The only way to plug the whole is to take away the opportunity by constraining and defunding the government, reducing their ability to be corrupted.<p>Neo-Marxists find it ridiculous to think that we can have a handful of billionaires & corporations controlling all the wealth in a country without that handful manipulating and controlling the political system. Big money has always come hand in hand with power. It&#x27;s silly to expect morality to fix this. The super wealthy will control government. We can either be ruled by the wealthy or we can eliminate wealth of this magnitude. Those are the only choices.<p>Personally I think both of these are naive, in much the same way. They are modernist ideas that assume an understanding we just don&#x27;t have. Human systems are complex and cannot be designed. The idea that we can start with a limited set of laws and a small government and let everything else emerge, and that the consequences of that emergence (including the political ones that may derail it) will be acceptable is not that different from the old communist 10 year plans.<p>Ideas like skin-in-the-game are in that category, IMO. Useful as a perspective. Sometimes useful in practice. Not realistic as a solution in many/most cases. Sometimes the world present opportunities for asymmetric risk. Even if we go by the Hammurabi code suggested by Nassim Taleb (currently promoting this idea) of killing an architect who&#x27;s building collapses there is potential for asymmetric risk. Maybe its small and asymmetric enough to be worth it (5% chance of killing 100 people; huge commission; the architect is old anyway) Maybe the immortal legacy of building a temple is worth the risk of death to the architect, but not the risk of death to the worshipers.<p>My point was that I don&#x27;t think we can build systems (or meta systems that let systems emerge) that don&#x27;t have a risk of moral hazard. Moral hazards exist. Usually morality is the anecdote. Sometimes it isn&#x27;t<p><i>edit: added paragraph</i>",1386163481

Both of these issues will soon disappear: many companies file accounts in XML (XBRL or iXBRL) because they have to prepare this format for HMRC (the UK&#x27;s tax agency), and Companies House began (at the beginning of November) to publish zip files of the accounts filed each day/month.<p>That said, if you go to Companies House web site to find the most recent accounts for a particular company, you will still pay 1GBP for the privilege, as (i) you won&#x27;t know which zip file to download and (ii) you won&#x27;t be able to parse the XML and to search the company names.<p>I&#x27;ve tried to that for you.  The site is still indexing the last year&#x27;s accounts, but you can search for a company name and click to get their last accounts.

The <i>marginal</i> productivity of an extra superhero is $100k even if the <i>mean</i> productivity is $550k.

Eric, who was fifteen, was unable to look Michael in the eye. “I don’t want to come here anymore,” he choked out.<p>I remember going with my parents (I was in high school) to see my grandfather and deal with the hospital -- he had been hospitalized for a reason I don&#x27;t recall and they found that his mind was damaged to the point that they couldn&#x27;t overlook it.  He said hello, tried to make small talk: how are things, do you have a girlfriend, any interesting developments in your life.  Small talk is not one of my skills.  I had nothing to say; I very often have nothing to say.  And he turned and started admonishing my parents for forcing me to come: &quot;He doesn&#x27;t want to be here. We live in different worlds.&quot;<p>It hurt, very badly.  I was there because I wanted to be there.<p>I can&#x27;t imagine, even after twelve years, <i>telling</i> your father that visiting him twice a year is a waste of your time. What a staggering blow.  No matter what Marylee believed (clearly, in this case, that Morton was guilty), the decent thing to do would have been to <i>not discuss it with his son</i>.",1386162088

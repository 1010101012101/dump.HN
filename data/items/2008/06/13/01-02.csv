216449,comment,216381,216381,0,0,lg,,,"This bothers me because it pretends that it's railing against an unenlightened status quo, and it isn't. Philosophers of physics considered, and largely rejected, the many-worlds interpretation because, if quantum events result in every possible outcome occurring in some world, and our consciousness ends up in one of them by some chancy process, then there's no reason why we observe some events with higher probabilities than others.  But we do, and many-worlds doesn't explain that.  The author talks around this by saying that, yes, these probabilities are very mysterious, indeed.  Well, there are other interpretations under which they're not.  Such as a) the many flavors of GRW (a collapse theory), b) the bohmian interpretation (waves + particles), and c) the many-minds interpretation (anti-realist and therefore the most out-there of the three).  Those are all pretty much consistent with QM, or there's a good reason to believe that they'll be beaten into a form that is so consistent (e.g. tumulka's relativized version of GRW-flash, but that's outside the scope of a HN comment).",1213321476

Janet Portman, a lawyer and an expert in landlord-tenant law ... said her doubts about the viability of Mr. Takle’s business model remain.""<p>Her concerns seemed a little strange to me. How is his model fundamentally different from a traditional property management company, or perhaps it's closer to the software companies that support that industry already? Both models are well established. Some Web-based conflation of the two sounds viable to me. He also offers a tenant screening service, which already exists as well.<p>“His jaunt to India to look for legal assistance is further evidence of his failure to understand the complexities of the legal world he was wading into.”<p>Where's the complexity? I owned a rental property for a few years, and apart from the initial purchase and subsequent sale, I never needed a lawyer. Of course, you could get sued, but that's hardly routine.<p>My biggest concern would be that I believe there's already a fair bit of competition in this space, at least for the individual services that he's packaging together.",1213320770

I say ""Burmese government"" because Burmese is an ethnicity, not a nationality. The fact that the Burmese government is calling themselves Myanmar is just whitewashing the fact they discriminate against non-Burmese.<p>The thing you have to understand about Myanmar is that it's made up of dozens of different cultures who are not Burmese, which is a big source of conflict in the region. In fact, many parts of Myanmar don't even speak Burmese. Therefore, I take some license in the use of the terms ""Burma"" and ""Myanmar"". You're right though, I should be more clear with this.",1213319674

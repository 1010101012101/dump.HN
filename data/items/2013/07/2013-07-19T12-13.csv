You will never know of this person or the fact they&#x27;re studying your data.<p>Right now, there are only 3 states even pretending to place responsible restrictions on the usage of this particular data. That is the issue. Of course we will not be getting rid of ALPRs, but we can certainly make sure they&#x27;re used for reasonable things.

The excuse for banning Hackaday is that it is allegedly a &quot;hacking&quot; website. The content filter is one of those canned IT solutions that governments love to patronize. It&#x27;s here to keep The Children safe, and because vagrants would obviously come to the library and masturbate if there were no content filter. I guess it works because I&#x27;ve never seen a vagrant masturbating in the library. There is no person at the library who has any direct control over the unbanning of content. Anyone may submit a link to be banned for any reason and it will probably be banned. Getting a ban removed is a more complicated process.

Yes, most lisps have it. I don&#x27;t think anyone denies emacs-lisp or AutoLISP were Lisps due to their lacking it.<p>Your suggestion of &quot;let&#x27;s say ...&quot; is based in what appears to be complete lack of familiarity with all of the languages involved. Providing useful libraries doesn&#x27;t preclude having done things right. Supplying a bare minimum of libraries does not preclude having made them miserable. There are plenty of awkward moments in using Common Lisp libraries that have made this plain to me.<p>Your suggestion that &quot;research first, and do the best&quot; is unpopular for &quot;obvious reasons&quot; is just hand-waving. The &quot;obvious reasons&quot; that are left unstated here are that &quot;research first and do the best&quot; languages general suck, hard. They suck because they sit in toy environments for years while the &quot;release early and iterate&quot; languages flourish under constant adaptation to real world usage. Both will have warts. The latter will be worth using.<p>Suggesting that &quot;Clojure is closer to Ruby that Lisp&quot; is just silly. What lisp? Scheme and Common Lisp, both definitely Lisps, are easily as different from each other as Clojure is from either. Ruby&#x27;s insane class monkey patching is closer to the type of advice you find in Common Lisp than the immutable datatypes and carefully conceived concurrency primitives found in Clojure. Common Lisps many different name classes are a horror found in few modern languages. There&#x27;s nothing in Clojure&#x27;s &quot;clever special syntax&quot; that many developers did not toy with using reader macros and other abominations. Your suggestion that the olders lisps data structures, usually cobbled together with a pattern of lists and a prayer, are somehow more thought through than Clojures is both ignorance and meanness combined. Yes, Common Lisp had many builtin and library added datatypes. No, it didn&#x27;t stop alists and structure built from underlying alists from being its fondest love.<p>As for classifying Ruby and Clojure as &quot;scripting&quot; languages, please define &quot;scripting&quot; language.

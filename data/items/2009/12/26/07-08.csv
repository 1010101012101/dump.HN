You can play with a kid, give the kid an appropriate handicap, and then you're free to play as well as you possibly can.<p>OK, it doesn't feel like the real game when I'm giving my barely 5 year old a 19 stone handicap on a 9x9 board.  But some day...<p>Another thing that I like about Go are the other games you can play.  I bought a second set of stones, split that into 6 groups, then spray painted them different colors.  That lets me play Pente with up to 8 people.",1261814248

1015824,comment,1015684,1015684,0,0,credo,,,"The misrepresentations in the first paragraph show that the writer's primary objective was to bash Gladwell and he doesn't seem to care much about the facts.<p>To say ""Gladwell comes to the conclusion that foreigners are unsafe because they are ... foreign."" and ""If only everyone were American or Canadian, the world would be a better and safer place."" is absurd.<p>It is true that Gladwell talked about low power-distance-index (PIDI) cultures and how pilots from low-PDI cultures were likely to act differently from pilots from high-PDI cultures. However, he didn't say that American pilots were superior to ""foreigners"". On the contrary, Gladwell  mentions a study showing that countries like Ireland, New Zealand, South Africa etc. had a lower PDI than the US. He also mentioned a study showing that Jamaica, Singapore, Sweden, Denmark etc. cultures were better able to tolerate/manage ambiguity than America.<p>As for Canada, I don't think Gladwell even mentions Canada in that chapter.<p>It is funny that the guy should have written a whole post to attack Gladwell and started the post with a blatant misrepresentation of what Gladwell wrote",1261814082

However, I found it rather... odd?... that he chose Martha's Vinyard as his example destination for a private pilot, who would need to ""check the weather, ..., and decide whether the risks are a reasonable match for his or her skills and equipment"", considering that there was a very famous plane crash under similar circumstances, of which I'm sure Greenspun is aware.  It struck me in an odd way - I guess it just seems a bit callous to throw in such a veiled reference in an article about airliner crashes.",1261813918

Who cares if Apple has 1000x more apps if the ones you actually spend 99% of the time using are on both platforms. At the moment background processes on the Android are really advantageous, although I imagine that will change before long. A locked down operating system is fighting against history. People will put up with that shit on their music player but not on a mobile os. Apple is either going to have to open up or they will be in for a slow burn.",1261812943

And even if they were, it's more likely coincidence than not: the musical effect Glass is going for relies on a particular progression which just happens to partially overlap a phrase Mahler once used.<p>Meanwhile, if you want soundtracks which shamelessly quote classical music...<p>* That awesome sequence in ""The Matrix"" where Neo's distracted by the woman in the red dress? The soundtrack gives you Rob D's ""Clubbed to Death"", but that's just the theme from Elgar's ""Enigma"" variations with a bass line.<p>* Listen to the score from ""Gladiator"". Then listen to ""Mars"" from Holst's ""The Planets"". In fact, this works with almost any action/war movie.<p>* Disney does it too: ""Once Upon a Dream"" from ""Sleeping Beauty"" is... well, a melody from ""Sleeping Beauty"" the ballet, by Tchaikovsky.<p>* A 1950's musical produced a hit song, ""Stranger in Paradise"". It's a melody from Alexander Borodin's opera ""Prince Igor"".<p>etc., etc.",1261812201

My grandfather had a few operations to remove bad skin, and I believe he was lucky.<p>There is the image of the bronzed aussie which comes from being outside without sun protection - (t) shirt, hat, sunscreen.  These days in Australia it would be irresponsible to suggest that people play outside in Summer without adequate protection.  Myself, I have been very badly sunburnt on two occasions (volcanic) and since endeavored not to have that happen again.<p>On the flip side, when it's not Summer or if you sun exposure is going to be minimal, why wear sunscreen?  You need that vitamin D.<p>Local comment: here in Japan, it's the fashion for women to have pale skin.  Plenty go around in summer with large parasols and probably lots of sunscreen.  I worry about their vitamin D intake.",1261812121

""Ain't"" has been very common for centuries and is still seen as a solecism.<p>The threshold for change seems to be when people who know the correct form opt not to use it, because it seems too fussy. I would say that's happened now with trailing prepositions and split infinitives.  We aren't near that threshold yet with ""begging the question"" though.  We may never be, because it's still needed for its original meaning.",1261811530

Speaking of the rims, I don't know if they've changed in the past three years (doubt it), but if they haven't, be careful with them. My dad bent one hitting in pot hole in San Antonio, and I bent two at some point (no idea how). It might not be immediately obvious they're bent, but they can suffer pretty nasty blowouts when the sidewall does finally deteriorate. Neither my dad nor I have done that in any other car, so I think it has something to do with the rims (although we <i>can</i> be a little rough on cars).",1261811422

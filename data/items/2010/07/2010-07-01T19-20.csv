If he delivers you to Paris rather than SF, you'll never fly with him again. You probably also have legal remedies against the airline, which if you exercised them would cause the pilot to lose his job.<p>In contrast, the incentives of lawmakers and bureaucrats are not aligned with those of ordinary citizens. For instance, in the face of budget shortfalls, government should cut the least vital services first, perhaps reducing the salaries of employees. Instead, they tend to cut the most important services first in an effort to increase support for tax hikes. The MTA in NYC is doing this, for example:<p><a href=""http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2009/12/13/2009-12-13_mta_is_in_danger_of_snuffing_out_the_bright_stars_of_tomorrow.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2009/12/13/2009-12-13_mt...</a><p>Abstracting and simplifying the underlying legislation assumes the politicians aren't lying to you.

I mean, I start little random blogs for things all the time and I still use Tumblr more often than not. Posterous might have a couple nice features, but it's hardly in another class. What is has in features it gives up in the austerity of its theming, an obtuse web interface, and just general lack of ""soul"". I know it's not quantifiable, but I feel like Tumblr has a soul (it is, after all, self-social, so it comes with a community, some humanity), and Posterous feels like it's trying to make charts go up and to the right.

I wonder what the pros and cons of the default-first and neutral-first strategies are? Default first automatically directs your attention to ""pain points"" in your life, but may make you blind to larger, more existential choices.

1479039,comment,1478887,1478887,0,0,acangiano,,,"I could have written this question myself. I, like you, read a large quantity of books on programming, mathematics, entrepreneurship, as well as interesting non-fiction titles.<p>First and foremost, I think that for technical books, a Kindle DX rather than a regular Kindle is a must. I used to own a severely underused Sony eReader. The main issue with it was the screen size. At 6"" it was useless for technical books.<p>I don't expect the Kindle DX to be perfect for technical books either. In fact, I heard that anything that doesn't come straight from the Kindle Store tends to look less than ideal (PDFs in particular). But since people like you and I pay for books, the inconvenience may be limited to research papers and a few free PDFs (Amazon offers a conversion service as well, but I don't know how well it works).<p>The truth of the matter is that, I love to be surrounded by books and have a large collection of titles. Having more books than I could possibly read in a lifetime gives me a constant incentive to read more and more to satisfy my passion for learning. If I want to learn about X, I can immediately grab a book off my shelf and immerse myself in it.<p>Being able to buy books in 60 seconds accomplishes the same thing without having to buy as many books or take up as much room.<p>A Kindle DX will decrease the expansion of my physical book collection, but the convenience is definitely there. Books are cheaper, immediate to buy, easier to search, and in many cases the Kindle will be lighter than the corresponding physical books.<p>It's clearly the future of reading, whether we like it or not, so I decided that it will be my gift to myself for my birthday in August. If I'm not happy, I can always resell it with little loss.<p>An even cheaper alternative would be the iPad and a Safari Online subscription. But even indoors, I assume that the backlit iPad is not nearly as nice on your eyes for extensive reading (plus, as is essentially an internet enabled computer, it could be more distracting as well).

I love HN, so I'll share the design of my system/the thinking behind it.<p>The problem to me is that you're asking developers to partake in (at least on the face value) ROI negative advertising. There's actually nothing wrong with ROI negative ads, iff they deliver network effects that make the ads ROI positive over time or the lifetime value of a user is more than the price of the app. We (developers) d*mn well know that natural network effects are not strong enough to make ROI positive when Apple is taking 30% of the pie each time. And for most iPhone Apps, the lifetime value of a user is that $.99 cents that the user pays when they buy the app. So there are very few iPhone apps who your current system can benefit. Because there's very few apps you can help, you're unlikely to get any traffic at all unless you're already famous/ willing to spend a ton on ads.<p>The solution is to embrace social networks and understand that sometimes, people need to pay for the stuff they're getting.Less cryptically: 
1)Integrate with facebook connect and twitter.<p>2)Require users to send a status message to both, effectively endorsing the app you're giving away to their friends. This solves your network issue as best you can (and it's how they'll be paying you).<p>3)Instead of holding regular sales of apps, go the groupon route, where the sale is almost a game, and the paid app that people can get for free changes regularly. This way you can get people to tweet/update about your app, and if you don't get the developer say 1000 downloads, you can say that the sale failed, and give out no refunds for the app purchases. This would entice users to seriously get their friends to download the app through your link (or however you track CPM). Be sure to keep track of your users (and their referrals) email addresses, so you can update them every 4 or so days with your new app that you're giving away.<p>4)Stop trying to sell your site as ""earning money"", and instead sell it as ""get paid apps free"". The difference in the psychology of the users that you'll attract will be HUGE.Plus nobody wants to earn 20cents per hour, but people would spend the same time to save $1.<p>5)I would start this business with the top 10 apps in the appstore, and without their permission. For this to work, you'll need about $3000, but it'll almost guarantee your success. People already know these apps, so you're lending their legitimacy to yourself by giving them away. I would also send a post to techcrunch (& etc) in advance about how you're ""giving the appstore away for free"" - they love apple and would love to write about you, especially if you send them something with a sensationalist headline like I just wrote. You could give away doodleJump, then angry birds, then .... And go down the list.

First, what systematic evil are you referring to? Second, nobody is holding a gun to their heads. They have a choice. Do you want to give up some of your time for a chance to learn something? Yes or no. There's no duping involved. It's laid out. Also, at the end of the post, I clearly state that anybody offering an internship program SHOULD offer some sort of fiscal or other reward if the intern performs well.""<p>Actually because of the economic situation in the United States people who don't have senior level experience in the job market take unpaid internships at companies because they think that they would be better selected for a position in that company.These people have to eat somehow. It's not morally right to send out internships and get these kinds of people, and then hire them. Or try to create a job market such as that while maximizing your own profits off of these people. It's almost equivocal to outsourcing, only outsourcing. I'm sure you haven't had these kinds of people ask you for a job, but keep in mind that does happen. Not only that but many internships even GSoC are an outright insult for free labor.<p>For instance the projects for Facebook in GSoC this year were ridiculous, they wanted college kids to build entire SMTP servers for their platforms, or drop in a replacement for libcurl, or at least code one, in one summer. Honestly if you ask me those tasks seem way over the level of students because they are broad projects requiring a team of developers to test for rigor in the system. They aren't the only company who pulls stunts like this, there are worse companies who want this done for free.<p>""As for the line you quote: in context, it's written from the perspective of the intern - not the employer.

If I touched the spot I could get it to bounce around from 2-3-4 bars.  Never once did it go to no signal.  Also, no matter what hand I hold the phone in my particular grip doesn't naturally touch the spot.<p>A friend of mine who also just got his phone has has the same experience as I have.  No real issue.<p>Another friend who received his phone on launch day can touch the spot and go from 5 bars to no signal in minutes.<p>The only commonality between the 2 phones that appear to have no problem is that they were bought at best buy from a very recent shipment.  The phone with the problem was bought from Apple and received on launch day.<p>IMHO, the biggest problem with the whole situation is how Apple has handled it.  Clearly some people have issues, but Apple being Apple has been arrogant about the whole ordeal.  This is one time where a little communication would go a long ways.  I'm going to guess they still aren't sure of the exact problem and that's why they have been totally quiet on the issue (other than SJs typical quips).<p>Also, the whole design defect thing needs to have some logic enter the equation.  Do people really think that the phone went through an entire hardware design cycle and a group of engineers never thought to test of the phone was held?

I also strongly agree that ""requiring referrals"" and having to go to 3 or 4 different doctors to get a test, diagnosis, prescription, and often times, another test just to make sure is terrible.

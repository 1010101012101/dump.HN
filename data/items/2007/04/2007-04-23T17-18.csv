Netscape, Yahoo, Amazon, Craigslist, EBay all had real products that made money and changed how people did business.  It didn't get to be bubblicious until about 1998, when people started getting venture funding for pet stores.<p>It was right around 97 that people started crying ""bubble!"", and I think that we're at about the same point in the economic cycle that we were then.  Tail end of the midcycle phase.  Assuming the housing bust doesn't tank the economy, the real bubble years are still ahead.<p>If we are in the midcycle phase, it's still a good time to start a company.  Capital's not flowing freely enough that <i>anyone</i> can get funded, so those who bootstrap good ideas now stand to profit handsomely when money managers seek to pull all their capital out of the failing real estate market and into the stock and startup market.<p>It's not time to worry until VCs start giving out $15M to <i>any</i> idiot with a business plan.  You don't want to be that idiot.",1177351034
16040,comment,16036,16038,0,0,jkush,,,"I thought about asking too, but there were 420+ applications for this round and it might be not enough of a tradeoff to provide that feedback.<p>Other than the obvious problem of people using that information to try and ""game"" the application process, if I was accepted I would prefer to have YCombinator's full attention trained on helping the startups out and less on providing feedback to those who didn't make it. <p>EDIT:<p>I realize that sounds greedy. What I meant was that I didn't get accepted and I'd rather see YC spend their energy helping those who did get accepted.

If you want to win, but think you can't, It's almost a cinch you won't. If you think you'll lose, you're lost; For out in the world we find Success begins with a fellow's will; It's all in the state of the mind.

I'm even interested in the place we've got in the final rating, but I'm sure the guys on #31 would be very upset to find that out :)<p>So, my question: it is possible to get something like this? At least for future rounds...",1177350711

16025,comment,15804,15938,0,0,BrandonM,,,"Yes, I agree that these types of tutorials can be useful, and they should probably exist in some kind of ""tutorial repository"" associated with different languages.  If that was the intention of the person who wrote it, then their time was time well spent in terms of how much they might help others.<p>Part of the feeling I get out of these submissions, though, is ""Hey, our platform is just as good as RoR/Arc/x because we can do what they did <i>this</i> easily.""  I was trying to point out that such activities are not really accurate depictions of how good a given platform is, because much of what makes a language or platform good is being able to ""think in the language"", to develop your design and ideas as you go.  Once you have a solid design in mind, you could use just about any language to implement it.<p>That's why I thought it would be more interesting for someone to develop something new using a given platform, and show the kind of work that gets done that way.  For example, pg often writes about how good Lisp is for writing programs when you're not sure of exactly what you want to do yet.  It would be intriguing to see someone use a similar approach with their platform of choice, recording the process, in order to show how flexible it is and what kinds of issues come up from the very start.  For example, how much re-writing occurs when a very small change is made?  Does the platform provide enough abstraction capabilities to make the underlying implementation transparent?<p>As I've been reading On Lisp lately, I'm finally starting to get why pg likes Lisp so much.  There's just something cool about being able to write macro-defining-macro-defining macros, and it turns out that it can make the development process much more liquid.  Do these platforms (like PHP) support similar levels of abstraction?  Judging from ""For example, to display the time elapsed since a site was added, you could use: $time->relativeTime($site['Site']['created']), now that is awesome!"" I think not, because there are definitely implementation-specific details there that hamper flexibility and would be better off being abstracted away somehow.",1177347746

Placing Amazon orders?  <p>I realize he's going for humor with some of the examples, but in each of these cases, once he's decided to outsource, written the e-mail requesting action (and making sure it's understandable to someone for whom english is not a first language), and checked to make sure it was done right, it's probably not a net gain.  And he's paying for it.<p>I'm sure there are instances where outsourcing is wonderful--coding (in some cases), research, waiting on hold--but using a service like this in place of a secretary sitting right outside your office seems misguided.",1190699710
59306,comment,59051,59090,0,0,euccastro,,,"He doesn't say his site will limit itself to mentoring about business.<p>As for evaluating mentees: that's a good question. I guess it's not very different from selecting any other type of associates (employees, cofounders), just the stakes are not so high: it's less traumatic to terminate a mentoring relationship if things go wrong. There is no money at stake, and any time investments have supposedly paid for themselves until not long before it became clear it was not working out. <p>The standard solution to hiring (written application, followed up with interview) should be a good start.",1190699076

59300,comment,58025,58361,0,0,geebee,,,"I couldn't disagree more.  ""Self interested"" absolutely does not have a well understood meaning in casual, every-day conversations.  It's one of the most ambiguous terms out there.<p>Try this out: at a dinner party (one that you don't care if you're invited back), declare that ""all people act out of self-interest, ultimately.""<p>Odds are good that two people will disagree quite vehemently about this, and at the core will be a fundamental disagreement about what it means to be ""self-interested"".

59298,comment,59036,59075,0,0,zhyder,,,"Keep in mind also that a strategic investor is always willing to pay more for the same stake than a purely financial investor.<p>This is because the strategic investor -in addition to reaping financial rewards- will also gain something else. In this case, it could be an exclusive agreement for Microsoft's ads, or use of MSN as the default search engine, integration of other MSN products, etc.<p>Even if Microsoft's deal puts a nominal valuation of $10B on Faceboook, Facebook's IPO (if it happened) could put the valuation lower.<p>Btw, this is an important point to note when evaluating exit strategies. Depending on the circumstances, getting acquired could be a much better exit even if the public markets are interested in your IPO. Youtube was probably not worth $1.6B based on just its financials, but it was worth that much <i>to Google</i> (or at least Dr. Schmidt thought so). ",1190697162
59297,comment,59285,59285,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I think you're misinterpreting Joe Kraus.  I've seen him do his ""Startup Addict"" presentation twice now, once at Startup School and once at a YC dinner, and in neither instance did I come away with the impression that he meant you have to start making money immediately.<p>The meaning I took from this ""business model in beta"" statement was, ""you have to be willing to admit you don't understand how you're going to make money; be willing to evolve the business model based on what you learn after launch"".  Which seems entirely consonant with what pg has said.",1190697145

For example, people that are too busy to read all those long articles in social news sites could outsource such time consuming tasks to India. ;>",1190696912

If majority of those users would be added anyway (if it was just a matter of time), and an astute investor could predict that, its valuation of $580m or even more would be justified.<p>Today most financial publications believe Murdoch got Myspace for a bargain.",1190696456

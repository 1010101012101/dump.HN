TimeWarner (and Comcast, even though you can't vote doesn't mean you can't lobby. . privately) I'm looking at you. I think the Google books lawsuit fiasco really damaged Google's reputation with the content creation community (and the <i></i>AA organizations) which in turn would negatively impact their negotiations with content providers.<p>Also, Google can, and probably will be seen as an all out competitor to traditional business models. They're building GoogleTV to destroy set top boxes and push people away from traditional media access and onto the net and copyrighted material still floods youtube. From a negotiating perspective, Google would have to make an extremely sweet offer to content creators to get them to think about putting content on the mashup Hulutube / YouHulu site. (I personally think YouHulu sounds better).",1309564777

2720628,comment,2718710,2720541,1,0,SamReidHughes,,,"Apparently they do, because they're teaching it.  But I guess you don't care about that, it's more important that you inform everybody about this distinction whereby you have a definition of C++ that requires more rigorous adherence to one of the standards, because it's very important that people be informed of this.  We wouldn't want beginners to write programs that use ""void main"" and work perfectly fine.  For that would be bad.  No, this tutorial should be retitled.  It should be retitled to ""Game Programming with a language that's not exactly C++ but is acceptable to Microsoft's C++ compiler.""  Because that's a correct title.  It would have been a perfectly fine tutorial that would introduce students to C++ programming, but right now it's horrible.<p>I was so glad to learn that people here are aware that C++ says main should return int.  Because I was sitting here, wondering if somebody on Hacker News knows that main should return int.  And then Ives came along to say, ""I do!""  That resolved my question.  But then as a special treat, somebody else came along to point out that the iostreams library is not part of the STL.  Or is it?  I sure wouldn't want to forget the distinction between The SL and The STL.  For they are different things.  I think.<p>Confession time:  One time, I learned that I had once learned some C++ from a tutorial that had used ""void main.""  I felt doomed.  I had just gotten over the phase where I thought it was okay not to correct somebody when not every part of every clause of every sentence they said was correct.  But then I found that I liked using void main.  And then before you knew it, I started writing <stdlib.h> instead of <cstdlib>, and then I used C99 header files, and then I used variable length arrays, and I used vector::data, and I liked it.  The next thing you know I found myself running two threads at the same time, wouldn't you believe it?  Now I know that what I was using was not C++, but that what I used was an abomination.",1309564483

If they are just going to plug into skype and let your FB info become your skype username and pw, then adoption might not take off as much due to having to open and run a separate application to do anything. On the other hand, if they make each facebook chat a virtual skype call and incorporate skype sessions onto the backend, then I could see this improving chat and make adding video capabilities fairly easy. As for it taking off, if it requires no extra work then sure, their userbase might grab it and go. If it's just a plugin for skype the application, then I'm not so sure.",1309564110

Where the market for these patents acts efficiently as as intended, the value of a patent is based strictly on its ability to allow a company to generate revenue.  This is a specific condition and the threshold of quality tends to be high for patents that can genuinely enable production.<p>The threshold needed for patents to be merely wielded as weapons is much lower.  However, as you can plainly see, this does not diminish their value in the patent marketplace.  Thus, the patent system in its current form encourages the misallocation of resources toward patents that do less to promote progress.<p>Software patents encourage the worse kind of abuse, in part because the patent office is utterly incapable of properly evaluating them; you can patent nearly anything.",1309562800

His logic: he figured out that he could influence the board to allow small price changes, adding pennies per pound to the current price. In volume, this would equate to significant increases in revenue. As with many of his genious schemes, Buffet's strategy was effective in raising the value of See's Candies over a short period of time - and with it, his personal wealth.<p>So I'm interested to hear what you think about the matter..

I'm not too surprised Apple wants to do a check at this point, just to make sure it's not giving out free, unauthorized copies to whomever may be asking. Also this requires an Internet connection because, well, you're downloading the image again.<p>Using the local media on your computer, say from an installation DVD for instance, you can install the seeds without restoring and without re-downloading. In fact you can even update the seeds with Software Update which does not require an Apple ID.<p>You're right that if you re-download the image you will have to verify the download, similarly when you go to grab the image off the dev site you have to login. However I'm not sure I agree this is comparable to other activation schemes. But for the sake of argument, let's just say it is.<p>The bottom line is I don't think most people want to re-download the image when they're doing an install. I certainly didn't. I just installed from my local media.<p>At the time, the machine I was using was disconnected from the Internet completely and I opted out of providing my Apple ID during set up.<p>The result was that I was able install the Lion seeds and was never at any point required to provide credentials that verified my status as a holder of a developer account.",1309561268

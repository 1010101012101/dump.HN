They \nassume their target audience\ndoesn&#x27;t care and, thus, they\ndon&#x27;t care.<p>Their <i>content</i> is really from the \nliterary fiction tradition of\n<i>drama</i> and <i>art</i> as in <i>communication,\ninterpretation of human experience,\nemotion</i>.  So, they want to concentrate\non the <i>drama</i> of the human experiences,\nthe horrible things that will happen\nto humans.<p>They like to play on \nfears, the threats of both nature\nand society, as in E.

10174930,comment,10174440,10174900,0,0,tjoff,,,"This is much closer to random access than sequential access.\nCounter question: How is appending to a log file repeatedly sequential access?<p>No meta data or other interaction required? Surely the sequential writes benefit from larger buffers?\nNot to mention that the flash block is way larger than the appended message. You would need TRIM to not make that an extremely wasteful operation, not sure if the typical Pi installations make use of it but a quick google seems to indicate that it at least has been a problem. So writing that 1 kbit now means reading a whole block, edit the content of it, and writing that whole block back - which is hardly sequential either. 1 Mbit/s is starting to seem pretty fast.<p>The only pathological case here is the &quot;not optimal sequential write case&quot;, which sure is enough to kill any random USB-thumbdrive or SD-card. Just copying two files two a thumdrive at once can kill performance by an order of magnitude compared to doing them one after another.",1441464661

Considering that hard disks and memories get faster and cheaper as well SQLite is even becoming a serious option for handling &quot;big data&quot;.<p>I use it in several of my personal and professional projects, especially in cases where data can be sharded well. The one thing that is a bit annoying though is the locking mechanism in SQLite, which prevents simultaneous writes to the database and locks it for reading while a write transaction is underway. If they could find a way to improve that behavior I think the use cases of SQLite would grow way beyond embedded application databases. Whether or not this is a good thing is of course a different question, but having a zero-configuration &quot;plug-and-play&quot; database engine could be a very attractive proposition to many people.<p>BerkeleyDB for example, which handles concurrent access much better than SQLite and also comes in a high-availability version is used in many production environments today, most notably as the backend of Amazon&#x27;s DynamoDB key/value store.",1441464440

Even ignoring the additional time and money you&#x27;ll have to spend printing the newsppaper yourself, it surely must be cheaper to print it all with industrial machines than making an equal amounts of goddamn microfilm and scanners for it! Economies of scale and stuff.<p>And yet this is normal on the web. Prepping content for client-side JS generation takes similar amounts of time (if not more) to just rendering the page on server. And then they have to send a) the content, and b) JS to render it, which takes more space than a rendered page, and <i>then</i> every client has to render it on its own. They&#x27;re wasting electricity on every goddamn step of the pipeline, from servers through the network to the client.

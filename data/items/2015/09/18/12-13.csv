As I understand it, everyone is entitled to 0.4% of whatever venture follows from the work they&#x27;d collectively do over that weekend. It wasn&#x27;t Billy who offered it, it was a friend of OP, one of the devs. Any of the devs could start a company as well and all of the other team members including Billy would have a 0.4% share in that, too. In fact the most sensible thing to do is for the 4 members to say &#x27;let&#x27;s start this thing up, take nearly 25% each, give Billy 0.4% and do our best&#x27;.

10238827,comment,10238132,10238431,0,0,IkmoIkmo,,,"Here&#x27;s how I understand it. OP&#x27;s buddy proposed the 0.4%, they ended up with 5 members in the team, OP, 3 other engineers and the guy who pitched the idea and is depicted as the asshole fitness biz guy (Billy), so 2% of the ownership of the startup the idea would potentially evolve into would end up in the hands of these initial team members <i>regardless of who runs the startup</i>.<p>i.e. if after the weekend 4 members said &#x27;that was fun, now let&#x27;s go home&#x27;, and 1 member said &#x27;oh guys, can I use all the code and make it into a company?&#x27;, then the other 4 guys would each have 0.4% ownership in that company even if they didn&#x27;t put in any money or any time beyond the weekend, on the basis of their work that weekend. I think that&#x27;s a sensible idea: 0.4% is not a lot, but it&#x27;s a weekend of work, and if the startup ends up worth $10m or $100m then it&#x27;s a nice kickback for a weekend&#x27;s work. If it ends up being worth nothing, no biggie, after all you just worked there a weekend and didn&#x27;t do anything after to make it a success.<p>In short, the 0.4% is a reward for anyone who decides &#x27;I don&#x27;t want to be part of the process of continuing this idea, but I want a small reward relative to what the idea I helped initialise could one day be worth&#x27;.<p>The issue is that when it&#x27;s all said and done, the process to decide who&#x27;d want to turn this into a startup and who didn&#x27;t looks to have been really authoritarian. One person turns it into a company and splits it 50/50 with a friend of his who wasn&#x27;t even part of the startup team, and then declares himself to be the owner and leader of the gig which is absolutely ridiculous. A fair process would either be &#x27;alright let&#x27;s sit together as equals, decide on how we launch the startup, who becomes the leader, equity, salary etc, and anyone who isn&#x27;t interested gets the 0.4% regardless&#x27;. Instead it was &#x27;I&#x27;m the leader, I&#x27;m half the owner, the other half is someone you&#x27;ve never met, you can still be part of the startup but it&#x27;s under my conditions and if you don&#x27;t like it you can have the 0.4%&#x27;.<p>In short I can see the problem OP has with this, added to implications that Billy was being a condescending asshole.<p>Fact of the matter is however that (1) OP and the team can decide to use the code and run a similar project themselves if they want and iterate on it faster than Billy ever could given the former have all the expertise of not just development but the codebase as well and (2) if they were never interested in that, they&#x27;d still get 0.4% of Billy&#x27;s venture (as long as the handshake deal is upheld i.e. which didn&#x27;t seem to be put into question).<p>I think the handshake deal was sensible and I see absolutely no legal basis for Billy to be able to appropriate the work exclusively to his startup. In short I think OP had the power, met an asshole, still has the power. They still have just as much right to the work, still can run a startup without Billy and still can own 0.4% of Billy&#x27;s venture.<p>edit: they ended up with a team of 9, billy and likely 8 devs, rather than 5, billy and 4 devs. Can&#x27;t be bothered to adjust the percentages etc but the same story applies.",1442580470

You can put any part of the development process on any number of different computers or distribute the work between different developers however you like.

So for example, we could pick every 2nd element of this sequence and get<p><pre><code>  1                (stopping after 1 term)\n  1, 1             (stopping after 2 terms)\n  1, 1, -1         (stopping after 3 terms)\n  1, 1, -1, 1      (stopping after 4 terms)\n  1, 1, -1, 1, -1  (stopping after 5 terms)\n</code></pre>\nThe discrepancy of an evenly spaced subsequence is obtained by adding together all the members of the subsequence and taking the absolute value. So the discrepancies of the sequences above are 1, 2, 1, 2, and 1.<p>The challenge is to find an evenly-spaced subsequence with as large a discrepancy as possible. For example, in a given sequence, can you find an evenly-spaced subsequence with a discrepancy of 10? of 100? of a million?<p>The paper has (apparently) proved that for <i>any</i> sequence, there is no upper limit to the discrepancies of evenly spaced subsequences, i.e. no matter how large the discrepancy of a subsequence you have found, there is always one larger.<p>The amazing thing about this result, to me, is the fact that it holds for <i>any</i> sequence of +1 and -1. Even if you try to engineer a sequence whose subsequences all have very small discrepancy, in some sense &quot;there isn&#x27;t enough room&quot;. You are always doomed to come up with a sequence containing evenly-spaced subsequences of arbitrarily large discrepancy.",1442578938

(i.e. all of it ex 0.4% * devs)?<p>This is what the text says:<p>>Billy brought along four other developer/designers he was already chatting with: Josh, Clay, Hayden, and another John.<p>>Our John, Team Paladin John, then went on to introduce ourselves and his idea for us to take 0.4% after helping launch the startup this weekend. That way should anyone go forward with the work product and it become a big success, at least there’s some kickback if this thing goes nuclear unicorn.<p>Also the way I read<p>>John explained that he’d spoken with Startup Weekend organizers and was told that contracts aren’t allowed from the event, so he asked for a handshake deal. Billy said he was happy with a handshake deal, and quickly moved the conversation forward without any handshaking actually taking place.<p>is that this is what everyone implicitly agreed to.  I don&#x27;t find it credible that &quot;I&#x27;m happy with a handshake deal&quot; and everyone moving forward isn&#x27;t evidence of a mutual understanding of what would happen after.  The actors acted as if everyone agreed that people would get 0.4% just for participating in the weekend, the terms that were brought to Billy, and that Billy was happy to agree to this.<p>The fact that these 0.4% terms came from Paladin&#x27;s camp rather than Billy makes it even more clear that the author is in the wrong.<p>It sounds to me like you&#x27;re saying 0.4% has nothing to do with this story whatsoever.  It sounds to me like it was agreed on.",1442578014

I personally use github all the time and have never seen a bug on it. I trust it completely (well.. tech wise).<p>Our repository is a few million lines, maybe 20,000 commits. The search works fine now it has been changed to call out to git properly (aside from the js searchbox thing in ff). Repositories are stored on the same server. I&#x27;m not going to dig up all the issue numbers and turn this into a support request, I am involved in reporting these and commenting on them @ gitlab.com.<p>The syntax highlighting updates have been very well received, but I mean gitlab was shipped with syntax highlighting that doesn&#x27;t work properly with Java code. Not exactly a unusual lang. And I guess that&#x27;s where my rant was going - you can&#x27;t ship crap like that, you should be shipping with 0 known bugs. Every time gitlab ships a bug like this, I take a knock in the office on your behalf and that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m so openly annoyed.<p>Perhaps you could do a LTR or open a beta programme for early adopters?",1442577861

Bugzilla didn&#x27;t set anything for those fields; relying on MySQL putting in the default value. At that time Bugzilla had loads of places where the database would insert things into the database. Fixing all of those would&#x27;ve been pretty daunting task and IMO MySQL not supporting those defaults anymore is a too invasive (backwards compatibility breaking) change.

Fixing this was pretty urgent and assumed that MySQL&#x27;s behaviour would change back.<p>Because of this MySQL change being backwards incompatible, it also broke restoring backups. This patch wouldn&#x27;t help with that though (it just changes the setting for the database connection created by Bugzilla; it doesn&#x27;t change the server setting).<p>It took many years until the Bugzilla code was less of a mess.

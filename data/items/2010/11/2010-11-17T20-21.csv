Children have to trust that their elders carry the wisdom of thier age and thoughtfully apply it when faced with trying circumstances. We trust that you will do the right thing and protect and safeguard our future. For each generation to leave a legacy that enables the next generation to continue to have a chance prosper and pursue its dreams. During the financial turmoil culminating in the financial crisis of 2008 you broke that trust. You sold out future generations to save a priviliedged few. You lied to the people to hide your failures and to protect your own fortunes. In order to avoid facing difficult problems and dealing up front with the people of that time, you chose to steal from future generations so you could continue with the graft, greed and lies upon which you and the favored select few built your empires. All the while just shifting the burden of your selfishness to us, your children. Well thank you for bankrupting our future! Now we are now saddled with debt that can not possibly be repaid. We have have limited hope of growing and developing ourselves and providing for our families. There is little opportunity for building our own dreams because we are overwhelmed with tax burdens, failed governement services, scarce and expensive resources, as well as world turmoil and general social unrest. Our currency, tattered and beaten, has been left a former shell of what it once was worth. People have largely given up because there's little incentive to build something of your own when most of the fruits of one's labor must go back to you Sammy to pay for past excesses or to help the masses of less fortunate that now exist b/c jobs and oppotunites are few and far between. So I hope you, your nephew Warren and the other priviledged few got to party it up while it was good because if there is a god you'll all rot in hell for your shamelessness.<p>Signed your destitute and dejected grand child",1290027373

1915680,comment,1915588,1915588,0,0,Groxx,,,"So... the problem is that it's too easy to forget your OpenID / its login.<p>I propose that the main reason for this is because browsers (and password-storing applications in general) have practically <i>zero</i> support for OpenID.  It's all handled by hand.  It's all in your head, and nowhere else.<p>Sorta reminds me of, oh... <i>browsers before password managers</i>.  Far far more people used only a couple username/password combinations, or stored their ones in a text file somewhere.  Now that managers are integrated, and secure external ones exist, it's viable to actually be safer with your logins, and many more people do so.  And now I rely so heavily on my password manager, I only know a couple key points-of-entry where its data is stored - the rest of my passwords are all randomly generated.<p>OpenID is essentially the next step, and it's precisely the same end-user problem.  Imagine if browsers supported it natively via a profile-like system; pick a profile, and every site you've associated with it is immediately logged in for you.  You'd be able to handle multiple people using your computer easily - just enter a password to use that profile, and everything can be switched for you.  No need to launch that password manager for every site, you sign in <i>once</i> and everything is automatically connected from that point.<p>OpenID can be <i>significantly</i> more user-friendly than username + password.

Too often the game mechanics end up being there for their own sake.<p>As others have mentioned you also have to make sure to not create unintended negative consequences. For example, maybe people earn a badge for fixing 5 bugs in 20 minutes. What happens then if people stop committing bugs so they can ""build up"" fixes and turn them in at once? What if people start creating bugs for themselves to fix? You can very easily create more problems for yourself if every angle is not carefully thought out - and even then you'll probably still create some problems.<p>Keep in mind I say all of this not as a game mechanics cynic but as someone whose entire startup is based around helping other people incorporate game mechanics (<a href=""http://iactionable.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://iactionable.com</a>).",1290026650

The Federal Reserve buys lots of government bonds off the market to raise its price with fake money. If you were holding lots of bonds when the Federal Reserve started QE, you'd earn capital gain by selling the bond because the price of the bond rose. The trade-off is the bond's <i>yield</i> will decrease correspondingly by paying less interest per dollar you can sell for, swapping your long term gain into short term gain (if you sell the bond now). Instead of holding onto the bond and earn the same interest you'd sell it and buy other stuff, like stocks, properties, or as the Federal Reserve would like, more cars.<p>As a consequence the price of stocks, properties and cars will <i>theoretically</i> rise because bond holders sell their bonds to the government and invest money in other things; The yields of those things, i.e. stocks, properties, commodities would <i>also decrease</i> corresponding, too.<p>Bond holders do really suddenly have gotten a short term gain, but <i>after selling the bonds they hold to take the short term gain they aren't going to be trading bonds anymore</i>. Not quite equal to giving money. Imagine if the government had a new policy to all software engineers: ""We will pay $200,000 to each software engineer who stops working as an engineer for 5 years"".

Getting into the trad climbing you are responsible for setting up your gear and making sure that it will hold in a fall. There are a lot of rules and best practices here so hackers tend to like this aspect.<p>3. A lot of hackers are looking for exercises that they can do and that is fun.

I do like the aspect of caching the climbs so that when you are off the beaten path you can get to the saved ones without service. I really like the routes showing up on the screen with a picture and the actual line going up the face. That kind of beta helps a lot and it's easier to find the climb than a drawing of the face. On the website I do like the map aspect but I don't know if I like that as the main navigation. you might want to cultivate the areas a bit more like how mountainproject or rc.com does things. Cheers to your app and I hope that you find success with it! I love rock climbing and anything that brings some exposure to it is a good thing.",1290024175

1915499,comment,1914675,1914675,0,0,jdietrich,,,"This debate has been going on for years in advertising. There is a cultural gulf between direct response advertising people and general advertising people. Direct response people know to the penny how well different adverts work because it is intrinsic to their medium. As a result, there exists a set of near-inviolable laws on how to run a direct response campaign that works. Long TV slots always work better than short ones, long copy in print works better than short copy, simple illustrations work better than clever art and so on. These rules almost directly contradict what is considered good by general advertising people, who rarely ever try to measure the effect of their advertising on the bottom line.<p>As business people, we have two choices. We can trust the taste and intuition of designers and hope that their vision is what the market demands. Or, we can test and measure relentlessly, seeking always to measure what matters - whether a decision will be profitable or not. It is entirely plausible that a test-driven environment may miss out on sparks of creative genius that happen to be utterly untestable. It is also possible that there is an invisible teapot orbiting the sun. I factor neither possibility into my decisions because I cannot possibly make rational decisions on that basis.<p>It has never been cheaper or easier to test. Rapid prototyping means that even complex hardware can be produced for testing at a cost which pales in comparison to the tooling for a mass-production run. Just In Time techniques and electronic point of sale systems allow brick-and-mortar retailers to test endless permutations of merchandising. A business without systematic testing is a ship with no compass. Gut instinct is valuable and laudable, but to fail to confirm it empirically is utterly foolish when the costs of testing are so small relative to the costs of even the most minor failure.",1290024113

I think anyone that reads the game previews and recaps on NBA.com, NFL.com or any other major league site can see where things could be automated.  That writing IS largely formulaic and forgettable.  It would be very interesting if instead of just doing the same thing through automation, it produced innovative stats and interpreted them in ways that gave the reader insight into the outcome of the game.<p>My current pet project is taking NBA data and transforming it into something beyond points per game, etc.  I think that's where the future of sports related AI resides.",1290024101

We didn't use follow the normal rules with the automakers but that was because it would have been bad politically for the UAW to lose their pensions, rather than out of any inability of bankruptcy to keep the automakers going in some form.

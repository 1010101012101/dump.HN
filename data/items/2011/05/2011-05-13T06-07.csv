Apple started off with fucking mp3 players and now makes 'post-PC' devices.<p>It just bothers SiValley that no one can touch the Windows domination.<p>Microsoft made $5 billion+ in profit last quarter. The CEO who's been in charge for the last 10 years should be given a prize for surviving and growing the company's profits.<p>A new emerging company will always have more room to grow. If you consider each company at its core competency they are all dominating.<p>Google has 64% or so search share. Bing+yahoo get 30% or so.
Microsoft has 90%+ desktop OS share. After 16 or 20 continuous quarters of growth Mac is still less than 10%.
Apple is dominating smartphones (though Android might slow it down, notably without making any profit itself - unless you want to count it as a defence for mobile search). It's also dominating Tablets and trying to change things - because it doesn't want to fight Microsoft head-on in PCs - Just too difficult given Microsoft's advantages.<p>So each company is dominating its niche and trying to find ways to make its niche dominate the entire tech landscape.<p>Microsoft still being so dominant and the success of Windows 7 point to Sinofsky and Ballmer being God level. Growing profits from a couple of billion a quarter to $5 billion to $6 billion a quarter is extremely impressive.<p>Apple's growth is more impressive - However, that doesn't mean Microsoft's profits are unimpressive and it'd be foolish to take your personal dislike of Microsoft as a reason to discount some really solid work by CEO Ballmer.<p>Finally, Ballmer's first duty is to Microsoft and himself and Gate and Microsoft people.

2543839,comment,2542742,2543705,16,0,Spyro7,,,"An insane valuation? At the start of January 2000, Microsoft's most recent earnings per share was $0.90. It's share price was about $58 dollars. This would have given it a P/E ratio of about 64x. This was relatively tame by dot com standards.<p>MSFT's current P/E ratio is about 10x. Just looking at that number right there, most people would conclude that MSFT was a great value play. In my personal opinion it is indeed a great value play - but not so long as Ballmer is still calling the shots.<p>If market prices were solely set based on income then you would be right; the price would eventually rise regardless of whether Ballmer remained at the helm or not. However, market prices are more complex than this. They also incorporate expectations for the future. It is here where MSFT's current problem is.<p>If you look at the components of MSFT's cash flow their major income sources are the Windows Operating System and the MS Office Suite. It is unbelievable that either revenue source will suddenly evaporate.<p>The problem is that both of MSFT's core business functions are under pressure. This pressure is coming from the decreasing dominance of the PC as the digital platform of choice and the increasing prevalence of Internet-based solutions to problems that were previously solved by offline software packages.<p>While MSFT is currently conducting expansions into a large array of industries, it is unlikely to dominate these industries to the same degree that it currently dominates the desktop sphere. In all of the industries where MSFT is trying to expand its footprint it faces vigorous competition from fairly formidable competitors. Even in its core industries, challenges are appearing on the horizon. Here's just a really quick summary:<p>1. Video Gaming - Nintendo, Sony, Apple? (Perhaps for ""casual"" gamers only, but I am not well versed enough to know how serious of a contender Apple is as of yet)<p>2. Tablets/Mobile - Google, Apple, HP<p>3. Search/Advertising - Google (Look, this is a big enough fish, I don't even need to name anything else)<p>4. Operating Systems - Google (ChromOS in the distant? future, Android everywhere, tablets eating market share), Apple (tablet popularity may erode Windows market share)<p>5. Server & Server Tools - ORCL, Linux, IBM, etc, etc, etc<p>6. Microsoft Office - Nothing serious yet, but GOOG is salivating at a chance to chip away at this<p>Market prices incorporate expectations for future growth as well as performance relative to peers. In the near term Microsoft is making buckets and buckets of solid cash. In the medium term, there are threats on the horizon that are looming large. In the long term, there is a great deal of uncertainty and this uncertainty is not made any better by strange moves like acquiring Skype for $8.5 billion.<p>I have heard some people say that acquiring Skype was a defensive move. Look, defensive moves like that are the last ditch strategy of someone that knows they are losing. There were a billion strategies that could have been taken that would have yielded a better strategic position.<p>What Microsoft needs is a visionary leader that can turn its buckets of cash into something that can carve out a substantial, permanent, and secure foothold on one of the fronts that they are fighting. That sounds cliche, but it is what they really need right now.<p>Microsoft is a fantastic company with an amazing amount of talent in it. I actually believe that it has some incredible earnings potential, but unlocking this potential will take bold, aggressive moves - not expensive defensive posturing.<p>It is not my intention to bash Microsoft. I have a lot of respect for the company. However, something obviously needs to change in response to the new challenges that they are facing. The status quo is no longer good enough.<p>Sources:<p>Edgar online for the year 2000 10-Q filing, yahoo finance for price in 2000, <a href=""http://www.betanews.com/joewilcox/article/Microsoft-Q3-2011-by-the-numbers-Record-1643B-Windows-revenue-declines/1304021955"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.betanews.com/joewilcox/article/Microsoft-Q3-2011-...</a> for revenue break down.<p>I apologize in advance for any formatting strangeness in this post.

Taking your new example, since the trading profits are roughly the same whether the advantage is 5 minutes or 20 seconds so long as the ship is seen first by telescope man, yet the probability of Bill mistakenly wasting his money on beer when he should have saved for bananas does depend on that length of time, then the utility and the profit aren't equal; and as the time advantage approaches 0, (and thus the utility you are talking about here approaches 0) the profit remains the same.<p>You are saying there is always some utility.

Chrome notebooks are priced beyond that of PC laptops, they offer no benefit over a PC laptop running Chrome, so why buy one?  Further ChromeOs will have limited local storage, and absolutely no native apps.  This means no Skype, no local movie player, etc.  A buyer would actually be getting less for their money by buying a ChromeOS machine instead of a $350 laptop at BestBuy with Chrome installed.<p>The form factor for consumption of media, video and news, does not require a keyboard.  In fact it does not seem to require much of the laptop form factor at all.  The tablet may already be the best solution, time will tell.  But ChromeOS is avoiding stepping on Android's toes, and is not expanding in that direction.  And that is limiting.<p>Leasing will only be available for schools, businesses, and governments--entities already in long term contracts with Apple or PC manufacturers.  There won't be much penetration in the short term.  And when it comes to price comparisons, ChromeOS will not have the support base and personelle which is already built up around PCs.<p>Lastly Chrome notebooks necessitate a wireless data plan, but as of now no carrier gives unlimited access for a low, flat fee.  That means no unlimited Netflix or Hulu.  And judging from my experience with a mobile data card, the connection is not stable enough for video streaming anyway, nor voice calls, nor multiplayer gaming.",1305268396

Far from 'just about any other place', the US is an outlier when it comes to incarceration. First world nations are all pretty much bunched in the 50-150/100k range, while the US incarcerates 750/100k (that includes kids - for just adults it's up around 1% currently incarcerated. 1%!). It's not 'utopia', but 'contemporary nations'. And it's not like it's always been like this - the US's insane level of incarceration was always a little high, but it started going way off the deep end around 1990.<p>There's also the rape angle as discussed above. Here in Australia, there's no real mindset about rape in prisons, but when I see Americans discuss it, it's either joked about or implicitly/explicitly declared to be 'part of the prison experience' and that you somehow deserve it if you go to jail... and it seems no-one is interested in wondering if it really is justice for a person imprisoned due to carrying a small amount of personal drugs to be raped as part of their 'debt to society'.<p>I guess it's the old 'glass houses' situation.",1305268023

I don't think we are in a bubble because people who invest usually consider profitably over potential to flip to the next sucker. Investors I've spoken with seem to be wanting in for the long haul.",1305266567

If Bill is very hungry today, but Joe is not, then Bill is rightly willing to pay a higher price for fruit.<p>Let's say that the loss of one ship raises the fruit price from $1 to $10. Bill wants to eat today and so he is saving his last $10 for when the fruit arrives.<p>As the ship crosses the ocean, the closer it gets to shore, the less risk there is in Bill spending his other $9. He wants to buy beer but is unwilling due to the risk of not being able to afford fruit.<p>To Bill, there is clear value in knowing how far along the ship has gone. The sooner he knows the better. Since knowing the ship is coming frees up his $9, this information also provides value to the brewer who will be able to sell his beer sooner. If the brewer sells his beer sooner, the brewer will be able to buy himself new shoes sooner, and so on. The 5 minutes of foreknowledge results more economic activity, and higher wealth in general. Bill gets his beer sooner, making him happier sooner. This has value. Mr. Guinness the Brewmaster gets his shoes sooner, easing his ankles sooner, and this is worth something. Every little bit of foreknowledge helps.<p>All arbitrage follows this same model. Whether the arbitrage profits are collected by one person or many is not relevant. There is utility in prices that accurately reflect supply and demand. The sooner prices reflect reality, the better.<p>If there are going to be fewer oranges available, the price should be higher to ensure an efficient distribution - a distribution to those who most value the oranges.<p>Galileo made prices 5 minutes more accurate, and while that is unsexy, it saved 5 minutes of inefficient trading. In aggregate, those 5 minutes end up being worth a lot.<p>Those minutes provide some level of utility equal to or greater than Galileo's profit. If Bill did not get at least $10 worth of utility from his oranges, he would not buy them, and Galileo would not receive Bill's money. These are voluntary transactions after all. Bill can always starve until tomorrow, or boil his shoes, or go forage for berries.<p>Fast information is worth something in itself.",1305266526

1262177,comment,1262017,1262017,0,0,dedward,,,"Deleted my previous ignorant comment - I had it backwards.\nThe idea behind TRIM is so the OS can tell the drive when a block is free, so the SSD can pro-actively erase it, which is something that otherwise slows down the write cycle if you are writing to a block that wasn't already clean.  That's not something you can just magic into a drive.....",1271170744

1262173,comment,1261746,1262083,0,0,koepked,,,"I think it's possible that the widespread use of non-lethal weapons could result in greater attrocities than the use of lethal weapons on the macro-level. It may not always be aparent, but in general, there is human restraint against killing other humans. A group of people would have to do, or at least be pegged with doing, something fairly high on the ""bad scale"" to justify use of lethal force. I suspect the threshold for beating them into submission with shotgun fired beanbags, high-pressured water, etc. would be much lower. At the level of an individual life, non-lethal would obviously be better. But at the level of one group of people trying to exert their will over another, I think non-lethal weapons would lead to more of that exertion, because it would be less difficult to justify.",1271170676

Particularly administrators are less concerned with what is in the database than how the database is organized and performs - for them the product does not currently offer any particular advantages at this stage. I will seriously consider how to better address this, given that administrators are arguably the most obvious consumers of this kind of product.<p>At this point the product addresses many of my own pain points of modelling and troubleshooting databases and data related issues from the point of view of a developer. Test departments too will benefit a lot from these features. As for the other groups it is true that they will mostly use a dedicated interface, yet for the time when the occasional manager or supporter does need/want to check out something he can. That is mostly an added benefit from the product being (hopefully) so easy to use.<p>Thanks for giving me something to consider for the future direction of the product.<p>By the way, the PDF example just demonstrates how the tool lets you download a file directly from a binary field in a table row (f.ex. bytea type column).

You have never stepped foot in a gym, clearly have no idea what happens there, but are perfectly willing to pass judgement on it.\nI find weightlifting itself immensly enjoyable, what I like to do with my muscles is to lift heavy things.  I enjoy the fact that this strength is useful throughout the other aspects of my life. (Think yardwork, sex, sports, etc.) I have solved more difficult problems both personal and intellectual while weight training that anything else that I do.\nI also enjoy the long term challenge of planning my training.  Once the easy gains are completed, advancing in strength becomes a rather difficult exercise in planning, discipline, execution, creativity, etc.",1271169503

I agree. Moving away from old mistakes (e.g. suburbia and car culture) is not a departure from modernity. No one is going to ban cars, but it turns out that spending 80 minutes per day in one really sucks, and if we can build a society where people live closer together and can ride a train to work, that's progress.<p>In any case, the old regime is going to die.

Modernity is mostly a good thing, but it has its pitfalls. For example, eating 150 pounds per year of added sugars-- mostly high-fructose corn syrup-- is not healthy. Nor are hydrogenated oils good for the body, at all. Suburbia has been mostly a mistake (intended to be the ""best of both worlds"" between rural and urban life, but closer to the worst of both for the poorer 90%). Wal-Marts are generally bad for communities, as they eviscerate their business-owning middle classes. Finally, although I don't foresee ""peak oil"" in the immediate future, it's becoming more expensive (economically and environmentally) to produce it.<p>When the chips are down, almost no one wants to get rid of modernity. The anti-vaccine morons and the creationist loons and the Tea Party slobs are out there, but they're on the fringe. On the other hand, the concerns being voiced in the ""authenticity"" movement are legitimate; is it really good for us, as a nation, to have an economy that relies on an environmentally costly fuel that we have to import from religiously bigoted and psychopathic despots?",1271167664

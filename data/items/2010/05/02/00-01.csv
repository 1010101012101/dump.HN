It was mostly large packs of bottles.  I managed to get 15  gallons in big jugs by going in the direction I saw a guy with jugs come from.  They wheeled a cart with water out, and people were pulling it in boxes straight from the cart. At first, maybe 3-4 people were loading up on water, but that was it.<p>Within the 20 minutes I was there, I watched the shelves almost empty completely of water.<p>One nice thing--the supermarket manager, before I even got to the checkout, had discounted all the water--thank you Shaws!<p>The psychology of it was interesting. I felt bad about the jugs (I am I hording? should I share) but then thought how I would feel if I didn't have enough clean water for my pregnant wife and child, and family who is visiting for the birth. I calculated that I would feel like a bigger jerk if I didn't look out for them, so I went with it.  I also called several friends and gave them a heads up on the run on water.  One of them didn't know, and was able to find some at a CVS.  So that is my story so far.<p>The article I just read said that the pipe was a ""custom pipe"" that burst, so they have no replacement ready and can't even give a timeframe.<p>edit: on the news they now think it was just a ""connector"" so it may be an easier fix.",1272761812

1311587,comment,1311468,1311551,0,0,mdolon,,,"From my personal experiences, I don't think that would work as well for a few of reasons:<p>- Students don't have that much time - just creating a business plan and convincing presentation/pitch was hard enough for most groups at our school.  Actually funding an idea and executing is much harder and more time consuming, especially if you're taking a lot of credit hours.<p>- With our business plan competition, we would start out with a large number of interested students and that number would drop with each meeting.  I'm not sure how many students would be able to manage (or have interest) in pursuing their business until the end of the competition.<p>- This would only work for certain businesses and eliminate ones that require research or a significant time investment.  When I took part in the competition, we were competing with a group working on a medical product that will hopefully save lives one day.  They were at the very early stages of their prototype after having researched the principles behind it for a couple of years.  They won the competition and I think(hope?) used the funds for their business.<p>- I assume it would also be harder to judge, as different businesses have different measures of success (based on revenue, # of customers, etc.)<p>All that said I do wish students would actively pursue a business to learn the ins and outs of it through active involvement.  I just don't think it's feasible to do it through a competition.  Maybe the whole entrepreneurship club could work on a business together though?  Or find a struggling local business and help them - that would be an immense learning experience in itself (I wish there was a class that did that).",1272761109

For example, using Facebook on multiple computers is simple right now. Now lets consider a p2p model. How do you handle uploading photos from a computer that isn't your main/home one? You'll need to basically synchronize content between the computer involved and your main one. There's also the case where I want to share a photo and not store it locally at all. What happens when some of the computers involved in your friend network are turned off and those friends want to view photos? I'm not sure you can make it completely P2P. You might need a central 'cache' of new content which then just gets pushed down to your friends once they sign in. And since everyone is disconnected that sounds like everyone needs to have a copy of their friend's data. I'm not interested in storing their photos on my PC.

1311543,comment,1310726,1310726,0,0,grellas,,,"In my own experience, as a brain matures, it does not really slow down in its important functions but rather incurs occasional and seemingly inexplicable lapses - the ""foggy moments"" associated with entering into middle age. Nothing to do about them, since they are an inevitable part of aging. In my business, I do complex and strategic analysis all day long in innumerable situations involving often difficult problems and not once has any lapse of this type affected anything that really counts (I am in my late 50s).<p>At the same time, there is a <i>quickness</i> in grasping large volumes of factual material when one is in his 30s or younger that does recede a bit in the 40s and 50s and beyond. That is why learning a foreign language becomes harder as one gets older - but, in that task, even a 12-year old has advantages over one in his 20s. There are just certain phases of life in which the brain is like a sponge and, if one is bright, all manner of detail can not only be pretty quickly absorbed but made to <i>stick</i>.<p>The lesson here is not to take the quick-absorption phase of life for granted and squander it - that is precisely the time to throw yourself into the deep things of learning (in whatever field) and get the most out of them.<p>Beyond that, though, there is no need to fret. In almost every way, in my experience, an older person is able to function ""at a higher level"" (to borrow a sport metaphor) in terms of thinking and decision-making than is a younger one. This may stem from other elements that supplement raw brain-power, such as experience, wisdom, and maturity. Thus, in spite of the occasional lapses and the loss of some of the old quickness, I would not trade my current mental capacities for those I had at a younger age even if I could.<p>This piece makes excellent points about the importance of exercise and other forms of mental stimulation being not only helpful but also indispensable to staying sharp.<p>Therefore, as long as you have prepared yourself well when you are young, the rest is a mere continuation of the old pattern, maybe not as vibrant but nothing at all to be dismayed about (at least until dementia sets in!).",1272759476

Wages rising for the same activity is actually rare and historically really weird. The chief way people improve in the world is to automate/creative destruction old professions in favor of more modern ones, and through lower costs due to efficiency. Investment banking enables and accelerates both of those processes.<p>It's a stretch, but not insane to think that, say, streaming video or iPads might not exist without investment banking.<p>Someone replies, who cares about iPads or streaming video? But how much have, say, TED talks enabled thinkers to make progress on hard important problems?<p>The causal chains here are long and complex, it's hard to say for sure. But creative destruction and replacement of old industries with new means better professions, and reducing costs is the other chief way to prosperity. You know about the huge blowups because they're noteworthy, you don't consider what industries wouldn't exist without a gradual re-allocating and efficiency, freeing up more people to do higher level work and driving costs down.<p>It's hard to do mentally, inevitably someone will reply, ""LOL, this guy thinks without investment banking there'd be no iPad!! That's all Jobs and Woz dude!!"" I don't know. Maybe. But why is South Korea so much nicer to live in than South Vietnam? Why did South Vietnam start to improve rapidly when they liberalized the banking system and started taking foreign investment?

I strongly recommend that you do grab a few people with medium technical background and ask them to perform a few tasks and then just observer (no helping).

The first is the rules the group agrees on that are enforced.  The second are your own personal boundaries that you choose.<p>I think the tendency is to make the enforced rules light; we like to tip the balance in the favor of more freedom as much as possible.  That said, this works best if individuals make an effort to be genuinely concerned about the interests of others in the group and therefore draw much more conservative boundaries around their own behavior.<p>In other words, groups need lots of social restrictions on behavior to work well, but it works best when each individual has a lot of room to decide what those boundaries are.  Only the egregiously bad behavior is formally addressed as a group.<p>Sometimes people don't realize there are two boundaries going on and rationalize rude behavior under the umbrella of freedom or free speech.",1316172183

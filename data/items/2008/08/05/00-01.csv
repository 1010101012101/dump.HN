266999,comment,266193,266619,0,0,noonespecial,,,"Actual questions asked a a building site my dad was at in Israel.<p>1) Is a regenerative break in an elevator doing work, even if the power is not fed back into the grid? Accepted answer: No, as long as its not fed back, but wasted as heat instead in a large resistor. Solution : A special system was constructed to divert the regenerative power into a large nickel-chromium element and not fed back into the grid for just that day. This heat was vented outside so that it wouldn't accidentally do work by heating the building in winter.<p>2) Does energy created in the power plant (from burning coal) count if its stored in a battery and then removed during Shabbat? Answer: No, as long as the fire part happened some other day. Solution: Large batteries were installed with inverters to feed critical systems during this day and were only charged during the week.<p>Of course, as mentioned, non Jews were hired to press buttons, open doors, and perform other actions during this time as well. The moral of the story is that it cost a lot more, and takes a lot longer to build a building like this!<p>I believe in God, and I don't want to disparage any man's religion but I think personally that God is not overly impressed by storing the energy in a battery so we can use it guilt free on the holy day...",1217897989

How can you find the ball that is heavier by using a balance and only two weighings?<p>Take (any) 6 of the balls, and divide into 2 groups of 3.  Weigh the groups of 3 against each other on the balance.<p>If one group is heavier:  The heavier ball is in that group of 3.  So take (any) 2 of the 3 balls in that group, and weigh them.  If either is heavier, you've found the heavy ball.  If those two weigh the same, the 3rd ball is the heavy one<p>If both groups weigh the same: The heavy ball is one of the remaining 2 balls.  Weigh those two to see which is heavier.<p>Given <i>n</i> weighings you can actually identify the heavy ball out of a group of upto <i>3^n</i> balls.",1217896976

266982,comment,266101,266421,0,0,gruseom,,,"<i>a little whitespace and naming conventions might still be a good idea for us newbies</i><p>The culture around K is fanatical about concision. This goes back to APL, though the K people (following the lead of Arthur Whitney, the designer of K and Q) take it further than anybody else. To the unfamiliar, K looks like a bad joke (check out the 40 lines of code at <a href=""http://www.nsl.com/k/s/s.k"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nsl.com/k/s/s.k</a>, which implement the spreadsheet at <a href=""http://www.nsl.com/papers/spreadsheet.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nsl.com/papers/spreadsheet.htm</a>), but these people know what they're doing. Whitney's product includes the language interpreter, a massively scalable RDBMS, a web server, and God knows what else, and the last time I downloaded it, the total size was 380 KB. My experience with that stuff was that the more I looked at it, the more in awe I became. It's a shame it's not more widely available.",1217896611
266981,comment,266456,266456,0,0,omouse,,,"<i>But why did Common Lisp need to build in at least 3 separate ways to map keys to values (getf, assoc, and hash tables)? The answer is because the language designers wanted all three.</i><p>Actually, the answer is that those three do different things. GETF is for property lists which look like '(key1 value1 key2 value2), ASSOC is for association lists which look like '((key1 . value1) (key2 . value2)), and GETHASH is for a hashtable which looks like a vector/array and not a list.<p>GETF returns the value of the first key that matches. GETHASH will return the value of the hashed key that matches.\nASSOC allows you to return any value for whatever key you're getting or whatever test you're using.<p>So each one has a different purpose. The trade-off is how <i>you</i> choose to map keys to values. It may be faster to use a hash-table instead of an assoc-list, or it may be easier to interact with an assoc-list rather than a property list. The point is that there's a choice and a reason why the choice is available.<p>This reminds me of all the newbie Java programmers who use the ArrayList class instead of looking for just the right data structure for what they want to do.",1217896315

266964,comment,266947,266947,0,0,Allocator2008,,,"I am a test automation engineer in Austin. I have worked with JUnit (Java) and CPPUnit (C++) for unit testing, and also with Borland SilkTest for GUI automation. So whereas I certainly cannot really comment too much one way or another in terms of what schools should be teaching, I will say that I have found java plug-ins to silktest essentially work when and where the JVM feels like working. They might work on one box, but not on another box, even though the code is the same. Java will not work the same from version to version, nor even from box to box on the same version, at least not reliably enough for proper automation testing to get done on a repeatable fashion. So now I write the silk-plugins in c instead of java, and that hasn't let me down yet. I don't know what we should teach in schools, I will leave that up to professors to figure out. I do know that if I am in an airplane at 35,000 feet, I do not want to have to rely upon the whims of the JVM to get my safely to my destination. When I am that far above sea-level, believe me, I am praying that the airplane's software was written in C! :-)",1217895113

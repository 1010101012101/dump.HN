When a language allows for slippage in conceptual integrity for the sake of familiarity, everyone loses.<p>For example, I'm a big fan of Ruby, but there a number of places where consistency in language axioms was dropped so as to supposedly make it more intuitive.  It does so at the cost of everyone having to remember both the fundamental concepts (e.g., ""the last expression evaluated in a method is the return value"") and the exceptions (""except when the method name ends with '=').<p>Lazy people like me think that's just extra work. :)<p>I don't know Erlang, but I suspect that if some form of ""multiple assignment that isn't really the multiple assignment you're used to"" were allowed, people would <i>still</i> have problems with it, but they would be harder to understand and resolve based on core language principals.",1217134407

258025,comment,257876,257876,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"So essentially, what they're saying is, Erlang doesn't let you program <i>in C</i>? So much for <i>that</i> language, eh? Psh.<p>-<p>I don't have any real Erlang experience, but in every functional language I've ever touched, doing that would involve function composition, not manually stuffing the value thus far into a box. (Wasn't Erlang at some point based on Prolog, btw?)",1217132916

258022,comment,257958,257958,0,0,qhoxie,,,"While I'm not a big fan of PHP in general, the fact that you feel/felt comfortable with ExpressionEngine could mean that a related PHP framework would be a good choice.  CodeIgniter (<a href=""http://codeigniter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://codeigniter.com</a>) is similar to what EE is built on, and EllisLab is going to have the next version of EE built directly on CI.  It's a really slim framework that doesn't force much on you, so you would get acquainted with PHP in general as well.<p>Along with that, I think it is a good idea to play with a number of languages and frameworks.  To me, the best test is building a simple application in them, a todo list or the like.  Try things like Django, Rails, Merb, CodeIgniter, Cake, and others to see what feels most natural and fun to you.<p>Be sure to also think of what else matters to you about a language/framework.  Check out communities, plugins and modules, and the documentation.",1217132639

258015,comment,257958,257958,0,0,mdasen,,,"I'm a big fan of the ""build a framework that you'll never use"" philosophy.  That isn't a joke.  You aren't going to be able to match the quality of the thousands upon thousands of hours that have gone into something like Django, but making a framework will make you a better framework user.  It makes you understand the flow, what building hooks is like, etc.  It also means that you'll be more ready to dive into some of the framework code than someone who just uses a framework.<p>But that's just my opinion from seeing so many people not understand how frameworks work and try to use them.",1217131889
258014,comment,258000,258000,0,0,pjackson,,,"<i>So I have an idea that I could develop myself but I do IT consulting fulltime.</i><p>I'm not sure how Ycombinator views it, but I think you should get some skin in the game. I know it can be tough to jump ship and work on your startup full or even half time, but you can't give yourself any excuses. (Like working IT consulting full time).<p>That said, outsourcing your development is a fairly common practice.<p>There are a number of boilerplate ""work for hire"" and ""intellectual property agreement"" forms available, but if you're serious about this idea, you could not spend your first $500-$1000 any better than getting a competant attorney to write you one.<p>You might be able to rely on oDesk or E-lance to provide you with protection. The people who outsource through those platforms are required to agree to the standard ""work for hire"" terms and conditions.<p>I'd go the lawyer route, though. If your idea gets traction, you'll eventually need one anyway.",1217131870
258013,comment,256521,257613,0,0,menloparkbum,,,"The thing about football quickness and reaction time, is that it is nearly all physical reaction speed. You rarely think at all. You've just repeated in practice what you need to do so many times that once you're on the field it becomes automatic. Running backs and receivers for the most part just need to be able to get downfield really, really fast. The offensive line needs to memorize more plays and formations, so a few points higher on the Wonderlic might help them in that regard. But once you're on the field, you aren't ""thinking"" in the sense that most people use the term. I don't think the Wonderlic scores even figure very highly into what makes a great football player. If anything, the scores are used by the coaches and trainers as a metric for figuring out the best approaches to teach the players what to do.<p>note: I played tight end throughout high school. I'm a bit distraught that this infographic suggests that the offensive tackles might have been smarter than me.",1217131866

Imagine that you spent $250K having a programmer write code for you only to see him take the code with him to a competitor and actually use it.<p>Opportunity acquisition isn't free.  If a company invests hundreds of thousands of dollars developing contacts and relationships they belong to the business, not the employee.<p>I gave the example of the trade show.  Think of it this way:  you spend $120K at a trade show in four days.  At the end of four days you have, say, 2,000 prospects and 50 great quality VIPs.  Now imagine that your sales guy goes to work for your direct competitor and hands over the list.<p>Sorry, non-compete agreements are not legal in California.<p>And, yes, we used Salesforce extensively.

There are a lot of nuances to developing a complex application and the longer someone gets away from coding on a daily basis the more they forget these things, they forget how to ""think like a programmer"", they overly abstract things and trivialize things. I can't help but realize that the ""architects"" who I have dealt with who no longer write code always seem to be stuck in the past, they want to use older libraries, patterns, etc that they used back when they were programming even if the prevailing wisdom of the platform currently differs.

I'd have a look myself, but I don't know who you are, what domain you are using, what domain is being used to spamvertise. Perhaps you can post the spamhaus evidence file and we can take a look?<p>Also, Spamhaus makes recommendations. Third parties use their lists to filter spam. It sounds unusual for a Spamhaus listing to result in a domain name shutdown, unless the DNS provider did that based on a listing. So this is not really Spamhaus' mistake (if indeed their evidence listing shows a history of hosting spamvertised websites - then there is no mistake on the listing. You could be listed either because your site/host/network has a solid history of not dealing with spam/abuse reports quickly, or because a big spam operator has landed on using your services. Are you sure it was just one site (and just advertising a free ipad)?)<p>Yes, I understand you run a facebook static html tab content site. But that isn't a million miles away from bog standard cheap/free hosting solutions that form the bulk of spamvertised websites. Might be worth investing some time looking at the parallels and how good cheap webhosts approach dealing with spamvertised websites and spammers.<p>So I'd suggest finding the evidence file, dealing with the problem(s) listed, then contacting Spamhaus with details of what you've done, and what's in place to reduce future abusive activity (if it's more than one site offering a free ipad).

I realized my understanding of the basics was very simplistic and as far away from ""hardcore"" as imaginable. I spent years working in the industry, and made the giant early mistake of not asking ""how does this actually work underneath?"" for way too long, so now I'm embarking on the likely life-long journey to fix that.<p>I realize that it's impossible to gain truly deep knowledge into every aspect of web engineering, but I believe that given time one can still be proficient in most of its areas. More importantly, this knowledge should be abstracted from the ""flavor of the month"" technology, and it should enable one to quickly learn and adapt. Also I think this knowledge should be pragmatic, practical and highly relevant to the real world and business application.<p>For starters I began learning more about how programming languages work underneath, which so far Programming Language Pragmatics 3rd ed has been really good at explaining, at just the right level of detail.<p>I imagine that some of the other fundamental areas of understanding for a web developer would be:<p>- operating systems
- networking 
- databases
- security
- distributed systems
- UX<p>For these areas, and more if you can identify them, would you folks be able to recommend modern and pragmatic texts that would give one a solid level of depth? I realize that there would be plenty of overlap with a standard CS curriculum, the difference would be in a higher focus on practical application, rather than theory.",1325317503

The people who work in some government jobs benefit me, while others harm me.<p>Ironically, whenever anyone tries to defend government the first thing they mention is the roads, which are less than 1% of the budget and an even smaller percentage of personnel, and toward which the actual work is done by locally contracted private firms.<p>Sure, there are a lot of coordination problems that government tries (with varying degrees of success) to solve, but this doesn't put it beyond reproach.  And it's certainly the case that even the US government has a fairly high degree of corruption, much of which diverts resources away from those in need toward those with political connections.<p>So in my view, governments derive legitimacy from their ability to solve coordination problems, adapt to changing circumstances, and stave off policies that incentivize corruption or put human rights at risk.<p>In the case of figurehead monarchies and the hereditary titles they grant, I think the best that could be said is that they offer nostalgia for a past era when such things mattered.  In reality, vane humans strive to show status by meeting with royalty, since in spite of the monarchy's utter backwardness and absurdity, is still not something everyone gets to do, so the scarcity of the opportunity creates social value.<p>The reality of knighthoods past is that they were titles awarded to warlords in exchange for tributes (aka voluntary taxes) paid to a more powerful warlord (aka king) who granted privileges, land, etc., in exchange for those tributes.<p>This still happens today only w/o the pageantry:  Imagine a US military truck with crates full of cash paying Afghan warlords for intel and mercenary troops.

Not that you have a few servers sitting around on standby waiting to be enabled...<p>There's one exception: if you've got ""internal"" servers that are only serving requests from you, or running occasional cron jobs (for monitoring and stuff like that), and you're sure that user traffic changes will never affect them, by all means go for a micro or a small. Those things aren't part of your publicly visible stack, so there's no sense wasting money.<p><i>Seriously, if you are doing any real MySQL work on AWS, DO NOT use RDS. The reality is that AWS doesn't nearly do the EBS tuning that you yourself can do (RAID-0, kernel tuning etc) on your own EBS based MySQL implementation.</i><p>Do you have any numbers on the performance difference between a well tuned EBS-based implementation and RDS?<p>Because speaking from experience, EBS based MySQL machines are always, without fail, the primary maintenance headache in any stack. They're <i>always</i> the machines that wake engineers up at 4 AM because of some EBS crappery or somesuch nonsense that necessitates intervention, and the promotion/backup/restore procedures can be touchy and error-prone. That's not even to mention the work involved in setting them up, testing, and getting them tuned right, which are serious stuff compared to the ""pick a name, size, version, and launch!"" process that RDS provides.<p>Most of what I could find seemed to suggest that the performance differences between RDS and well tuned EBS MySQL servers of comparable size were relatively small. For instance, from <a href=""http://www.mysqlperformanceblog.com/2011/08/04/mysql-performance-on-ec2ebs-versus-rds/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mysqlperformanceblog.com/2011/08/04/mysql-perform...</a>: ""My benchmarks generally showed that I was not able to outstrip RDS 5.1′s performance with the combination of stock MySQL 5.1, EC2, and a 10-volume EBS RAID.""<p>If you think that's wrong and the difference is really much higher, I'd be interested to know.<p>Part of me is skeptical that any serious differences would persist for very long: if it's so easy to do this ""right"" so that you end up with a EBS+EC2 MySQL server that significantly outperforms RDS for general-purpose workloads, why wouldn't the RDS team set up RDS servers that way behind the scenes? I would think that Amazon should know how to efficiently utilize its own EBS volumes, right?",1325315657

The person in question is probably in poor shape as to verbal and mathematical achievement/intelligence much more from having lousy instruction in elementary school than from having a bad family background (considering what other people in the same birth family with different teachers in school were able to do, and what neighbors who had the same teachers were NOT able to do), but the effect in adult life is the same--lacking reading and math skills holds many people back, even if they have very strong spatial abilities.<p>More broadly, for any set of subsets of mental abilities, some people will be lucky and have above-average levels in all of them, and some other people will have wide ""scatter"" in their abilities. This is rediscovered every time a new brand of IQ test is normed.",1325315148

And if anyone was doing IP lookups of URI's in emails and using the SBL for that (which I've never even heard of), that's clearly a misuse of the SBL anyway, because that's not what the SBL is supposed to be used for.<p>As the policy clearly says:<p>---
<a href=""http://www.spamhaus.org/sbl/policy.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.spamhaus.org/sbl/policy.html</a><p>The Spamhaus Block List (""SBL"") Advisory is a database of IP addresses which do not meet Spamhaus's policy for acceptance of inbound email and therefore from which Spamhaus does not recommend the acceptance of electronic mail. 
---<p>So it should only be used to block machines sending email, nothing about the content thereof.<p>There's RHSBLs (like SURBL and URIBL) that are related to dealing with URI's in emails, that's nothing to do with IP RBLs like SBL.<p>> Why? Because the guys at the SBL want to pressure Yahoo, where paulgraham.com is hosted, to delete the site of a company they believe is spamming<p>What's that got to do with the SBL again? The SBL is purely about what IP addresses ""from which Spamhaus does not recommend the acceptance of electronic mail"", nothing about websites. So that whole accusation feels wrong.

Only that it's very important and influential. One way of arguing for my claim from this worldview would be that the NYT is obstructing systemic change and preserving an elite. Any one company whose demise would be ""hugely helpful in getting our political system back on the track"" must be important, right?

Since everything in Clojure is an expression (this is not true of Python or JS, I'm not sure about F#), I don't need to perform much analysis, I just need to make sure that each expression doesn't care about the difference between a future and a realized value.<p>Let's assume three primitives:<p>* an asynchronous future [1]<p>* something which merges a list of futures and realized values into a single future representing a list of values<p>* something which takes a function and a future, and returns a future representing '(apply fn value-of-future)', that will be realized once the future is realized<p>All we need to do is take every expression where a function is called, merge the arguments together, and apply the final primitive to the expression.  The expression will return a future, which can then be picked up by the parent expression, and so on.<p>This glosses over how special forms are handled, and how the 'force' functionality works.  Also, as I mentioned in the presentation, how the code executes is pretty opaque, and some sort of higher-order analysis would be nice so that it could be visualized using graphviz or something.<p>This is still an experimental feature, and will probably remain so until the 1.0.0 release of Lamina (I'm working on 0.5.0 right now).  I'm not aware of any other macro that rips apart normal Clojure code quite as completely, which means that this is sort of uncharted territory.

Why in the world is an app allowed to directly query a fixed identifier in the first place?! There should be a specific ID-Api of which the <i>user</i> controls via a system dialog the same way a user controls how long a browser stores cookies for.

So Apple kowtows to the advertisers and permits uncontrollable tracking while the end-users are stuck with their only choice being 'use or not use' an app based on how much they perceive it abusing them. Instead of being introduced to a world full of self determination and limitless possibilities (as early computer adopters were), modern day users are shown a standard no-free-lunch world where ""they either get you coming or going"". Developers are still able to seek out freedom, but the goal of empowering an end user to solve their own problems couldn't be farther from sight.<p>(And yes, Android has most of these same problems in addition to some of its own, which is why I said dichotomies aren't useful.)",1334076228

Apple made the increased resolution the primary selling point of the iPad 3rd gen: Everyone knew they would, and it was the worst kept secret in technology (indeed it was expected almost a year earlier!). Just as with the iPhone 4(s), no one is chasing them: Sure, there are products coming out somewhere in between (the 3rd gen iPad -- love mine, btw -- has a resolution far past the point of diminished returns owing to a naive scaling system), but no one is going to even bother trying to match them because...why.<p>I can't follow your core narrative because it makes no sense.

If you have non-disjoint data and a single process environment, then you do have to consider shared mutable information at some point in your architecture.  This is mitigated by the fact that shared mutable information in the web domain is typically handled by a database or information store of some kind designed for concurrent use.  I am going to make the somewhat bold claim that if you store shared, mutable data in the web application process you are doing it wrong (and for other reasons besides just this one).",1334074660

The animations are fairly smooth on the Series 5, which is surprising because the Atom processor chokes on a lot of big websites.<p>Unfortunately I don't think this greatly helps your productivity while using Chrome OS.  It's more convenient for having multiple windows.  Perhaps if you were doing some writing in Google Docs you could have 1 window for your writing and research, then another for when you want to take a break.  That makes sense.  However it seems, and I could be wrong on this, that when you open a new app it opens in a tab within whatever window you were last using.<p>It feels like something that was designed purely as a ""how do we abstract away windows management"" and not about usability. They need to do something to make apps be real apps, meaning no tab chrome <i>at all</i>.  And they need to intelligently find a way to do that.  So perhaps apps launched from the home screen will default to launching in a new window without any chrome, and they would need a good way for multitasking from there (the auto-hide bar is a fair start).",1334074567

3822841,comment,3821769,3821769,1,0,muraiki,,,"Richard Fisher, CEO of the Dallas Federal Reserve, pointed out the threat of Medicare to the budget in 2008. As you can imagine, it's only gotten worse since then:<p>""Please sit tight while I walk you through the math of Medicare. As you may know, the program comes in three parts: Medicare Part A, which covers hospital stays; Medicare B, which covers doctor visits; and Medicare D, the drug benefit that went into effect just 29 months ago. The infinite-horizon present discounted value of the unfunded liability for Medicare A is $34.4 trillion. The unfunded liability of Medicare B is an additional $34 trillion. The shortfall for Medicare D adds another $17.2 trillion. The total? If you wanted to cover the unfunded liability of all three programs today, you would be stuck with an $85.6 trillion bill. That is more than six times as large as the bill for Social Security. It is more than six times the annual output of the entire U.S. economy.<p>I want to remind you that I am only talking about the unfunded portions of Social Security and Medicare. It is what the current payment scheme of Social Security payroll taxes, Medicare payroll taxes, membership fees for Medicare B, copays, deductibles and all other revenue currently channeled to our entitlement system will not cover under current rules. These existing revenue streams must remain in place in perpetuity to handle the funded entitlement liabilities. Reduce or eliminate this income and the unfunded liability grows. Increase benefits and the liability grows as well.""<p><a href=""http://www.dallasfed.org/news/speeches/fisher/2008/fs080528.cfm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dallasfed.org/news/speeches/fisher/2008/fs080528....</a>",1334073939

789309,comment,788856,788856,0,0,callahad,,,"When it comes to pedagogy, the sigils and syntax of Ruby have always bothered me. The author notes the girls having trouble with <i>dark red</i> versus <i>darkred</i>, or getting the hash syntax right. I imagine a number of them wondered why <i>""center""</i> and <i>""xx-large""</i> went inside quotation marks, while <i>saddlebrown</i> did not. Furthermore, special string values like ""center"" and ""xx-large"" somewhat undermine the teacher's assertion that quotations demarcate ""a sort of free zone for text.""<p>Are there better languages or tools for this task? Has anyone here tried to teach programming to non-programmers using a visual language like Scratch or a simpler language like Scheme or Basic? How did it go? Shoes is an incredible platform, I just wish the underlying language had a more immediately comprehensible syntax. (PLT-Shoes, anyone?)",1251385155

The limited memory made multimedia application development a challenge on the N810, and the front facing camera was rather useless for photo taking. Now this will truly be a use-anywhere, do-anything mobile computing platform. Looking forward to developing on it.<p>Battery life was always a problem on the N810 with constant connectivity. We'll see how it holds up on the N900.",1251385083

Me, I’m going to selfishly enjoy the good times that are left, and support activities like establishing seed banks and archives of humanity’s achievements (because we have done some amazing things) in case there is any resurgence of human life or other intelligent life in the future.<p>But the hope of humanity even beginning to turn the tide against what’s coming? Evidence suggests it’ll be impossible. There’s too many us -- far, far too many of us -- and not enough who care about what’s happening, or even believe it.<p>What’s next is a fait accompli.",1251385066
789305,comment,788856,789269,0,0,mquander,,,"My point is that I feel the things that C illustrates and the style of programming it enforces are not that important to learn if you are just starting to program.  If you are approaching it from an academic math/CS standpoint, you'd be better off teaching something much simpler like Scheme, and if you're approaching it from a building-cool-stuff sort of hands-on standpoint, I suggest you would be better off teaching Python, Ruby, or one of many other languages with less drudge work (a lot of syntax cruft, manual memory allocation, not very abstract) to do than C.<p>There may be value to learning C, but I think it's not a good return on investment of your time until you understand many other foundational ideas about programming and CS.",1251385060

I'm just saying that YC does not choose teams this way.

789298,comment,788957,789156,0,0,Robin_Message,,,"Capitalism is a great idea on paper, but completely ignores the realities of human behavior. It will never work, because people are not mindless drones. Why would anyone chose to receive ""money"" in exchange for their hard work? Why would anyone accept that people who prepare food and care for children should receive far less of what society creates (by being paid less ""money"") than people who organise other people into meeting other people who then build a rival to twitter?<p>Worker's cooperatives are a sensible system for organising labour. Notable in the UK are John Lewis (not quite a co-operative I think, but owned by its workers) which is doing surprisingly well ATM and the co-operative bank which survived the credit crunch with nary a whimper.<p>The pressure to sell out will always be there though, and given the essential fact that capital is winning, it seems unlikely labour can ever overtake. It is also hindered by the totally discredited communist movement and the fact it is deeply counter-cultural, e.g. against the protestant work ethic.<p>Also, the article you linked makes a fairly typical mistake of equating regulation, provision of public goods, and provision of merit goods with socialism, when really governments can do all of the above and still be deeply capitalist.<p>Also, in reply to ""Only one system of government and economic theory has come close to delivering on the promise Socialism makes: the Republic and Free Market Capitalism found in the USA.""

For example, it is not the government's business if a consumer chooses to go to Jamba Juice because they like Mormons, but it most certainly is their business if Jamba Juice chooses to hire only Mormans.  You can claim it's the same all you like, but the law is on my side, it is different, as it should be.<p>A consumer is free to discriminate by whatever criteria he wishes when purchasing goods, the employer is not allowed to do so when hiring labor.  They are different.  Employers are in a much better position to abuse their power and when they do it has a far greater impact on the person being discriminated against; that's why it's different and that's why we regulate them.",1251384043

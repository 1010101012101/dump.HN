The probation office could easily have reached the conclusion that the property taken was valued at $5 million based on the FBI affidavit and at that point probation is not permitted under the Guidelines. Supervised release additionally would have prevented any computer use for 2-3 years.

Most of the contributors have moved over to the site including Evan (one of the co-founders).<p>But one of the real benefits of the change has been that there is now integration with the other Wikimedia sites: the same login that one uses to edit Wikipedia works to edit Wikivoyage, and a fair few Wikipedia admins and regulars have jumped in to help Wikivoyage out.<p>In addition, Wikivoyage now has direct inclusion of images from Wikimedia Commons, so if you are writing a travel guide, you can just hop over to Commons and find an image, rather than having to upload your own like you did on Wikitravel. And there is an international community of people who curate that image collection.<p>Now that the contributors have mostly moved over, Wikitravel are now just descending into spammy oblivion, while Wikivoyage adds new and fresh content, fixes mistakes and so on.<p>All the while Wikitravel employees seem to be going around spamming blog posts and posting about how this is all an ""anti-capitalist"" conspiracy against them.

If Ortiz really believed that a Guidelines sentence was inappropriate they could have offered a capped sentence of six months or stipulated to a lower financial valuation of the stolen documents to bring down the Guideline. Neither was done. A prosecutor's recommendation is useful, but it is not binding on the Court. They did not agree to dismiss the other counts of the indictment, and while this would not affect the Guidelines, the sentencing judge could decide to impose sentences consecutively. Swartz would have been without computer access during a two to three year term of supervised release as well. If Ortiz really believed what she wrote in her Statement her office would have limited Swartz' criminal exposure to six months. US Attorneys' offices do this all the time. Hers did not.

Most of the major Telecoms were participants in this massive, warrantless eavesdropping system.  So the EFF and the ACLU filed lawsuits against these telecoms.  Federal courts began ruling against the telecoms (Yay!  Democracy in action!).<p>So the telecoms ""bought"" some lawmakers.  In July, 2008, the senate passed H.R. 6304 which provided retro-active immunity to telephone companies that participated in the Bush administration's warrantless surveillance program.<p>ie:  This is not unsubstantiated.  This is not hand-waving.  The system was ""bought"".<p>Since then, congress doesn't even bother with immunity any more.

No comment on their actions.]<p><i>I must, however, make clear that this offices conduct was appropriate in bringing and handling this case.</i>[States that they were correct to bring and handle the case.  May be read as they handled the case correctly BUT does NOT actually state that.] <i>The career prosecutors handling this matter took on the difficult task of enforcing a law they had taken an oath to uphold, and did so reasonably.</i> [Claims the career prosecutors were reasonable. Were all involved 'career prosecutors' or is someone about to be hung out to dry?

Then why would they (note Ortiz is not taking responsibility for this judgement) want to seek 7 years if it went to trial] <i>That is why in the discussions with his counsel about a resolution of the case this office sought an appropriate sentence that matched the alleged conduct  a sentence that we would recommend to the judge of six months in a low security setting.</i> [not stated also admission of 13 felonies or that if he wanted a trial because he believed himself not guilty the appropriate sentence to seek would have been 7 years.  Thats what you get for believing you have a right to a trial and not just doing what we say.] <i>While at the same time, his defense counsel would have been free to recommend a sentence of probation. </i>[Not stated: for 13 admitted felonies.] <i>Ultimately, any sentence imposed would have been up to the judge.</i> [Not our responsibility really.] <i>At no time did this office ever seek  or ever tell Mr. Swartzs attorneys that it intended to seek  maximum penalties under the law.</i> [We were really generous and told Mr. Swartz's attourneys that we intended to seek something between the maximum and ten times what was appropriate (by our admission) if he didn't plead guilty]<p><i>As federal prosecutors, our mission includes protecting the use of computers and the Internet by enforcing the law as fairly and responsibly as possible.</i> [Sounds reasonable but does it match their actions?] <i>We strive to do our best to fulfill this mission every day.</i>[But we aren't commenting on the rest of our mission or how we have done matching this mission in this case.]",1358421390

5071999,comment,5071477,5071856,42,0,patio11,,,"Can I phrase the same objection in a more HN-y manner?<p>SSH terminals are high-sensitivity software.  We frequently use them, with <i>very</i> sensitive credentials, to log into secured servers.  There are two zones of trust involved: we trust that our local machine is not rooted, and we trust that the server is not rooted.  The magic of SSL means that no matter how foul everything is between those two zones of trust, we can't get compromised.<p>If we embed the SSH terminal in the browser, we now have four zones of trust: our local machine, the browser, the SSH terminal extension, and the server we connect to.<p>This is a <i>very scary</i> broadening of our attack surface.  While the terminal app siting on your machine is decades old and has been tested extensively, the browser extension almost certainly has not.  The browser extension, in addition to possibly having vulnerabilities itself, is executing in the context of the browser.  The browser is a <i>very scary place to be</i>, because its whole mission in life is connecting to the untrusted, infected cesspool of the Internet and then doing what the Internet tells it to.  By grace of God and Google engineers, we generally assume that our browsers aren't going to crack out of the sandbox surrounding the sandbox surrounding the sandbox that all that evil Internet stuff is executing in, but we expect that, in the normal course of operation, those inner sandboxes are going to fall into the hands of the enemy, repeatedly.<p>It therefore seems to be an <i>exceptionally</i> bad idea to take our holiest-of-holy credentials and move them inside the sandbox, closer to the attackers.<p>This is particularly true in terms of a risk/benefit analysis, since the risks are incredible and the only benefit is ""Saves you from having to do a single key chord to pop open an additional terminal on your machine.""<p>This is moot if you have total confidence in the Chrome and Native Client teams to never have a mistake which lets someone, e.g., read arbitrary process memory.  That's happened before -- Mark Dowd et al found it.  That would be pretty sucky if it happened on a browser you logged into your bank, because the attacker can probably grab your cookie and banking session.  It would be much worse, though, if it happened on a machine used by a bank sysadmin who unwisely decided to use a terminal within his browser, because why steal one session when you can just steal the bank?  (n.b. Note how this is possible without causing Chrome to execute arbitrary code or defeating the OS's protections against Chrome doing stuff outside the Chrome-box.)",1358420418

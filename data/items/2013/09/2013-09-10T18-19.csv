However, my fear is that it will either not work when it&#x27;s needed, or that they may have some manner of technology that allows them to scan for such things, or possibly the footprints left behind by such software, or logging them into an OS that looks like a fresh install might be enough to illicit some suspicion.<p>Politely declining to share your password is within your rights at the US border. However, giving them a &quot;fake&quot; password seems like it may be a crime.

The sexism comes from the culture that even makes &quot;make me a sandwich&quot; a remark to use in a bullying context. Bullying comes in all forms, but gender-based bullying has another insidious component in that it re-enforces sexist ideas and cultural norms. This is why addressing it independently is important. Just addressing bullying does not eliminate the culture where these terms derive their power.",1378839546

Not only did we get fewer signups (which we expected). The engagement rate for users who had tried first was significantly LOWER. Exact same product. Same first time experience. One group tried before signing up, the other didn&#x27;t. They liked it less. Isn&#x27;t that odd?<p>From my understanding, other services have experienced this same phenomenon. Why does this happen? It is hard to explain. It could be some aspect of our try-first design was flawed. But, my guess is that it&#x27;s something psychological about signing up.<p>I had expected and hoped that the try-first flow would improve word of mouth. I think many do. But it didn&#x27;t.

That it is up to you and to US to make the case that bombing Syria will actually lead to less casualties than not bombing it? Not up to me. What do you want me to oppose? The case that has never been made?<p>Either I have misunderstood you, or you have some severe problems with the basic logic itself. Let me explain again:<p>1. You propose the goal (e.g. reduce the number of civilian deaths in Syria, topple Assad, make a point for the World that it is bad to use WMD and that America is going to take action)<p>2. You state the actions that you&#x27;re going to undertake to achieve it.<p>3. And you make the case for your own experts, lawmakers, the World an your citizens that the stated actions are the best to achieve your goals.<p>During the aftermath of WMD use US has sequentially stated multiple confronting goals (e.g. help people of Syria, but not topple Assad; topple Assad; that there is no threat to US, that there is threat to US; yesterday Hillary Clinton has said that the reason to go is to make a point to scare off worlds dictators not to use WMD). So, there is no clear goal.<p>There is only the first action stated: the bombing. So, there is no clear stated path for stopping conflict after the bombing. And, respectively, no reasoning behind undertaking it.<p>No clear 1., only the first step of 2, no 3. How do you suppose me to argue with the things that are not even being stated?<p>I can only support arguments that the _supposed_ goal(1.) is likely to be achieved with other actions than bombing the country. And that all the stated goals are different from the real goal.<p>I have contacts all over the World, and since no one has said to me that I&#x27;m in any way dishonest, for now I would go that it is you who is wrong in your assessment.<p>After the blatant lies about Iraq, it is hard for me to conceive how can you be so uncritical to the statements of your governments.<p>BTW, Tom Malinowski, the director of HRWs Washington office, has been nominated by Obama to be Assistant Secretary of State for Democracy, Human Rights and Labor. For a number of years HRW is known to be very selective in what human rights violations it was to report in the Latin America. Currently the HRW is calling for the bombing of Syria (and, obviously, doesn&#x27;t make it&#x27;s case too). I think it is understandable that I&#x27;m skeptical about it&#x27;s reports and goals.

In the UK and much of Europe, the &quot;chip and PIN&quot; card, properly called the EMV (for &quot;Europay, MasterCard and Visa&quot;), is dominant; it&#x27;s a regular plastic card, but it&#x27;s embedded with a tiny computer chip that serves as authentication in conjunction with a regular four-digit PIN. The EMV system is much more secure than the magnetic stripe card; when it was introduced to France, the country saw an 80% reduction in card fraud. (It was introduced in 1992, by the way. The France of 20 years ago was more advanced than the US is now.) The benefits: authentication is far more sophisticated than reading a simple magnetized strip; it incorporates actual encryption protocols like DES, the Data Encryption Standard.<p>The chief vulnerability of the EMV system? IT STILL HAS MAGNETIC STRIPES. EMV cards have a magnetic stripe so they can be used in dumber, slower countries, like the US, which can&#x27;t read the chips. The only real hack of the EMV system relies on transferring information from the magnetic stripe, rather than the chip.",1378839111

I&#x27;d rather someone get their hands on my fingerprint than my passport, driver&#x27;s license, and credit cards, and it seems much more difficult to steal than those things.<p>I think the fingerprint scanner is positioned not to be some indestructible lock like RSA or a safe-deposit box, but a reasonably decent deterrent like door locks and The Club.

I hope to learn from your experiences.<p>AMQP is indeed a complicated protocol so I can appreciate your reluctance to write a client.<p>The failure mode I was referring to with Redis is that you now have additional custom code which pulls from Redis and inserts to RabbitMQ. This is another process that can fail, and some of those failure modes could result in duplicate or lost messages. For example, agentredrabbit could shutdown in an unclean way where the &quot;dump&quot; file doesn&#x27;t get written. Also, you didn&#x27;t mention if you&#x27;re using Redis in AOF or RDB persistence mode, but in RDB it only writes to disk occasionally so you could lose messages there. Also, if agentredrabbit fails then Redis could run out of memory (RabbitMQ automatically writes to disk once memory limits are exceeded).<p>I will believe that writing to Redis is /always/ faster than writing to RabbitMQ, but I&#x27;d really like to know what other things you guys tried to make RabbitMQ actually work for you. Did you experiment with queue settings? Memory limits? Erlang tweaks? SSDs? What was it about shovel that didn&#x27;t work the way you wanted it to?

Very true, I&#x27;m looking at this less from a position of preventing a friend from fraping you, and more from a business security standpoint where you would hopefully shield a passcode, and probably use a longer alphanumeric one anyway.

Likewise, I&#x27;m sure the Air Force, Army etc. would all like to have antigravity generators, and they have abundant money to throw at the problem, so they must have them, right?<p>Of course not. &#x27;A compiler that adds backdoors to software&#x27; implies a compiler that <i>knows</i> which routines are for security and which are not. How exactly is it to distinguish between<p><pre><code>  get_string(super_sekrit_password)
</code></pre>
and<p><pre><code>  get_string(pretty_background_color)
</code></pre>
for example? What if the background color is actually a way of revealing hidden messages, do you think it can see that coming? You&#x27;re asking for a system which not only inserts unwanted code seamlessly into an application, but which can actually <i>model the intention of the programmer</i> and make decisions about how to compromise the code. From within the compiler running on a standard desktop or laptop, without noticeably extending compile times. I&#x27;m sorry, but given what a poor job <i>humans</i> do at turning specifications into code, the idea that there&#x27;s a super-clever anti-security demon lurking inside every compiler is just laughable.<p>And that&#x27;s before the other obvious objection that looking at compiled code in a debugger/disassembler is going to reveal lumps of code that were not put there by the original author. Invisible on a sufficiently large project? Sure, but an encryption/decryption program doesn&#x27;t need to be very large to begin with - all it has to do is to reliably transform a block of data into scrambled form and back again. This is more amenable to proof than most computer programs (not least because it has no need to be interactive). Furthermore, we can easily imagine test cases that are very very short; ROT-13 is a lousy cipher, but it <i>is</i> a cipher, and one that can be implemented in ~20 lines of (non-obfuscated) code. Now suppose we make a variant that asks the user how many places to rotate by (eg 14) and that number functions as our &#x27;secret&#x27; key. Still hopelessly insecure to anyone over the age of 10, but what of it? Wouldn&#x27;t your hypothesized &#x27;insecurity demon&#x27; need to put a backdoor in anyway, because it is an encryption tool, be it ever so primitive? And wouldn&#x27;t that block of code show up in a debugger? If your answer is no, you&#x27;re now positing hidden functionality that not only divines programmers&#x27; intentions and subverts those that are intended to add security, but <i>also</i> looks at the quality of the security algorithm and only sticks in a backdoor if it passes a certain threshold of cleverness.<p>I <i>wish</i> compilers had those smarts built in! Think how much tedious/craptacular code could be automated away by simply labeling things as &#x27;sekrit!!&#x27; and having the NSA module inside the compiler generate lightweight, reliable code with no real penalty!

But why are things the way they are and how do we progress from there?<p>In my experience, a lot of the difficulty in comprehending/accepting that women experience the industry so differently than men is that many men either A) over-generalize from an exceptional interaction, or B) follow those that have over-generalized. By &quot;A&quot; I mean that men can rely on confirmation bias to cement their impression of the female experience based on a few choice interactions. For example, confirmation bias can allow a random chat with a well-adjusted, confident woman who appears impervious to tech sexism can dispel for many years any notion in that man&#x27;s mind that sexism exists in the industry. Thereafter, contradictory signals of other women can themselves be dismissed as exceptions, and because of cognitive dissonance, can actually reinforce his misconception.<p>By &quot;B&quot; I mean that many men have no relevant direct interactions with women (given their low numbers) and may follow the lead of the people with whom they associate, who are by definition men. Any confirmation bias of those men then spreads to them.<p>In addressing this, what is not often recognized is that individual women do have unique experiences. They are affected to varying degrees and in various ways by prejudism and ostracization. As a male, rather than tip-toe around or ignore the issue with a female colleague, I&#x27;ve found the best hueristic for recognizing your potential participation in a prejudicial environment is to earnestly sense/inquire the nature of her past experience. (You may also share your own experiences of prejudism, if any.) By opening such a dialogue, you establish a common foundation and framework for maximizing the team and progressing the industry.<p>IMHO, focusing on the direct, open, and individual treatment of interpersonal relationships (and moving away from the one-experience-fits-all mentality, which lacks common sense and is susceptible to confirmation bias) is an important next step for evolving relations between social groups in general.",1378838199

Also, what&#x27;s the false-positive ratio, what&#x27;s the false-negative ratio?<p>Security: traditionally fingerprint sensors have been pretty terrible at security given a photocopier and a few bits and pieces. You wouldn&#x27;t need 10 attempts to get into the phone, you could theoretically get it in 1 if you have the expertise. A passcode on the other hand, you have a much lower chance of guessing that within 10 tries before a wipe.

First, it&#x27;s fine to try to stop discrimination in tech in the general sense, but it shouldn&#x27;t be framed as a problem specifically with tech, doing so narrows the focus to the point at which it can&#x27;t actually address the general problem only very specific limited instances. Secondly, you&#x27;re confusing two different issues, the gender imbalance in tech, and gender based discrimination in tech. While it&#x27;s true there is a gender imbalance in tech, I do not accept that it&#x27;s being caused by gender discrimination in tech. Yes, discrimination does sometimes occur, however I don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s much more prevalent in tech than it is in any other industry. The gender imbalance and media stereotypes around tech have an amplifying effect, not to mention being a significant minority in any situation tends to lead to being singled out and marginalized (human nature). If you want to fix tech, then fix the media stereotypes and more importantly the poor quality of tech education in schools, the rest will work itself out as the gender imbalance is equalized. As for the more general problem on misogyny in all parts of life, I&#x27;m not sure how best to fix that, biggots of all kinds exist everywhere, I do my best to avoid them whenever possible (in the rare cases where I&#x27;m actually in charge of them I&#x27;d set them straight with what&#x27;s acceptable, but that rarely happens).",1378837383

It would be interesting to hear what a lawyer says about that. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a truly reasonable defense and I wouldn&#x27;t want to rely on it. (If we&#x27;re thinking &quot;ideal legal world&quot;, then I&#x27;d like clickwraps to be human-readable and people to actually read them.)<p>But I think there&#x27;s a very clear distinction between a simple agreement with the original and with altering the DOM. If you are clever enough to alter the DOM you definitely know that the alterations are not going to be sent back to the server. You also know that agreeing will let you use the service because the server will think you agreed to the original. That seems like a clear-cut case of fraud to me. I don&#x27;t see why an agreement to the original contract is invalidated because you weren&#x27;t offered the opportunity to make a counter-offer (I agree that&#x27;s a shitty situation, though). That&#x27;s why I think it&#x27;s like a contract in the mail; you get an offer and you can agree to that or not. You can make a counter-offer but it will be binned.<p>Consideration isn&#x27;t solely concerned with monetary purchases, is it? I imagine they can construe your incoming data as valuable. It would be interesting to know if sites like Reddit can claim user interaction has inherent value for the site and for the users. I guess the EULA would be granting you license to use the software, but would not give any additional value to the developer so consideration does seem to invalidate that.<p>You&#x27;re probably right that a ToS is going to be hard to uphold in civil court.<p>Anyway, thank you for elaborating, I&#x27;m glad to get a better understanding of your perspective and contract law.",1378836991

Here&#x27;s some suggestions:<p>* The <title> tag doesn&#x27;t get the subject line.<p>* I want a readable url. I would assume that my test url p34t3aaa44n could be a bit simpler. After all, the whole of YouTube is 11 characters. Something like /p34t3a/Title would be awesome. In base64 with 6 digit ids you still have a namespace of 68.7 billion posts.<p>* There should be special markup just for your site.  Here&#x27;s an idea, something like:<p>[theme:moonlight]<p>Look at the nice darkness.<p>* I don&#x27;t use signatures but many do. This will be a hassle for them.<p>* And finally, choose a different name. As an American at least, &quot;Urgeous&quot; sounds awful.  Something more in-tune to what the site is would be great.

Before the interview he kept saying he thought it was &quot;foolish that people would use Google to research people in the first place&quot; and that &quot;nobody should believe Google results anyways&quot;.<p>When Pete was in college there were <i>several</i> criminals who all shared his name and his results were a mess. One of them included a story about someone suspected of dealing drugs. At the time we never thought to save or bookmark those results because we had no idea we&#x27;d be starting a company and being interviewed by NPR years later.<p>We couldn&#x27;t find an exact article about a drug dealer (perhaps it actually was taken down). We WERE able to show him several other results with about criminals with his name. We linked him to them. When he asked us about it, we told him we couldn&#x27;t find it, but we offered to redo the interview and be less specific &quot;Pete was being mistaken for criminals with the same name&quot; since we could show results for that.<p>In his article he claims we simply did not respond to these requests. When I asked him about it afterwards he apologized and said &quot;he must have missed that email&quot;. He didn&#x27;t update the story though. It seems like he wanted to tell a story about how online reputation management helps people permeate lies and that&#x27;s why you shouldn&#x27;t trust Google.<p>All that said, we learned a valuable lesson. We no longer use the term &quot;drug dealer&quot; we use &quot;criminals&quot; and we link to specific articles we&#x27;re still able to find so people can&#x27;t question the validity",1378836599

The NSA has data that is not necessarily shared, so if the top people decide to &quot;do you in&quot;, such as Obama and Romney, they have only to &quot;edit&quot; the data - and you have no way of proving they didn&#x27;t. Meanwhile, we know the FISC will accept whatever NSA gives them as the absolute truth.",1378836240

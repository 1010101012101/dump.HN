8790171,comment,8788770,8789876,0,0,shykes,,,"That&#x27;s an understandable criticism, even though it makes me want to die inside. Let me try and explain my point of view, and why this whole situation is so frustrating to me.<p>First, my impression is that I <i>do</i> spend most of my days listening to criticism by people smarter than me, revisiting my assumptions, and trying very hard to make people feel appreciated for their effort in the process. Most of that effort is spent on IRC, the Docker repository, and the Docker mailing lists (in decreasing order of time invested). Obviously, I am biased. But I&#x27;m willing to bet that if you spent a week or 2 on the IRC channel interacting with me and the other maintainers, you would develop an entirely different picture of how we work and how we treat criticism.<p>Second: aggressive blog posts by competitors and their coverage in Hacker News. This is something new to me, and I acknowledge that I have been handling it very poorly. I thought I had learned my lesson last time, but as your message points out, it appears I have not. Basically, I handle very badly the combination of 1) feigned indignation and ignorance by people with clear conflicts of interest; 2) a small number of vocal haters waiting for an opportunity to pile on, and 3) lots of intelligent but uninformed bystanders. When someone makes a valid criticism, with the ultimate goal of improving the project, as harsh as it is, I will be the first to embrace it. But here we are talking about something different: a blog post written by commercial competitors, with the intent of making the project look as bad as possible - using valid <i>known</i> criticism when available, but not shying away from recycling old criticism which has since been addressed, or sometimes making up facts altogether - resulting in a more compelling narrative that will &quot;stick&quot; better. These are posts crafted by venture-backed companies competing with Docker, inc. in the same general space (developer and IT tools), with all sorts of conflicts of interests. I now these people personally, they are all part of the Silicon Valley scene, and what they do is very intentional. It has nothing to do with honest criticism or attempts to improve the project - those are taking place all day long on the repo, and never generate any drama. It&#x27;s just business as usual, but as an engineer it drives me crazy. What drives me most crazy is how easily people fall for it. But, I acknowledge that it&#x27;s not an excuse for the sort of knee-jerk reactions I&#x27;ve engaged in. As frustrating as it is, I think the proper reaction would be to 1) stay under the radar, wait for the drama to die down; 2) take a solid look at the criticism, extract the <i>real</i> one from the political bs, and focus on fixing that; 3) take a solid look at how well we communicate what we do. For example, we have made good progress on security compared to 6 months ago, but clearly we have done a poor job at explaining that and showing solid proof points. 4) as outrageously hypocritical and unfair as these posts appear to <i>me</i>, who know the full back story and understand the commercial motivations, remember that the rest of the world is not aware of the commercial back story. And frankly, they don&#x27;t care. What they&#x27;ll remember is our response to the criticism.<p>So - I did my best to express my point of view on all this. My personal lesson is that success is not that fun, and sometimes I regret the days when Docker was not successful. But at the same time there is a sense of responsibility: a great many people use this tool every day, and we are responsible for improving those tools every day. Once these vc-backed competitors (whether it&#x27;s coreos or flynn) are done writing their blog posts, they aren&#x27;t going to fix the project. That&#x27;s our responsibility, and nothing else should matter.<p>So, for what it&#x27;s worth, my new year&#x27;s resolution will be to do a better job at the above - and perhaps take a break from Hacker News altogether, too ;) Feel free to join the IRC channel if you want to discuss this some more. In the open, of course!",1419368183

Maybe I didn&#x27;t care about &quot;organic&quot; or &quot;cage-free&quot; at age 15 or nobody cared 25 year ago, but we were one of those &quot;battery cage&quot; farms. It was long buildings with 5 rows of double stacked cages. The floor of the cage was slanted so that the eggs rolled out into a trough in the front.

8790158,comment,8788685,8790002,0,0,facepalm,,,"I knew this would come up. You probably think because computers weren&#x27;t marketed to women? What if electronics companies only marketed to men because it was mostly men who were into electronics? Then rinse, repeat, why were fewer women interested in electronics, and so on...<p>I don&#x27;t have all the answers, but one answer is: because the women were doing other things. There seems to be this idea that women who don&#x27;t go into engineering become &quot;desperate housewives&quot;. In reality they become physicians or bankers or lawyers. The article actually mentions that.<p>The reality is that computing is a pretty anti-social activity. Yes, there are meetings and clients, but your main job is being glued to a computer screen, alone. Frankly, I don&#x27;t think it is a recipe for happiness, and women are smart enough to recognize it. Also, women have more options - a major one becoming mothers. So less incentive to try hard, maybe? Even the article mentions that the famous female entrepreneur eventually dropped out to become a mother. Although of course in the next sentence they have to reframe it as &quot;went to Austin for her husband&#x27;s job&quot; instead of &quot;to become a mother&quot;. Can&#x27;t have that.<p>I recently met a young woman who was torn between studying mathematics or becoming a social worker.

Our plan is to turn as much moderation over to the community as possible; getting there is going to require additional mechanisms.<p>HN has one axiom: it&#x27;s a site for stories that gratify intellectual curiosity. All the rest is details.<p>The existing mechanisms—upvoting and /newest—are insufficient for the community to sort out which stories are best by that standard. The trouble with upvoting is that stories that gratify intellectual curiosity regularly attract fewer upvotes than stories that are interesting for other reasons. And the trouble with /newest is that not enough users are willing to do the work of sifting through it to find the best submissions. That&#x27;s easy to understand: it&#x27;s tedious. Wading through hundreds of posts to find perhaps 3% that gratify intellectual curiosity, does not gratify intellectual curiosity! The very reason people come to HN is a reason not to want to do that, and so we have a tragedy-of-the-commons problem.<p>So if upvoting and /newest are suboptimal for HN, what should we do? In the long run, the answer (hopefully) is to have a new system that lets the community take care of it. But in the short run, before we know what the new system should be, the answer is (a) to experiment, and (b) to do things manually before trying to systematize anything.<p>Over the last several months, we&#x27;ve tried various things. For example, we tried randomly placing a story from /newest on the front page. We didn&#x27;t roll that out to everybody, but we did for enough users to make it clear that it wasn&#x27;t going anywhere. The median randomly selected story is too poor in quality for this to work.<p>Of our experiments, the one that has produced by far the best results (to judge by receipt of upvotes, non-receipt of flags, and comments about the article being good) is reviewing the story stream for high-quality submissions and occasionally lobbing one or two of them onto the bottom of the front page. That&#x27;s the experiment that ColinWright was referring to, or rather the form it has evolved into. The idea is, from the pool of stories that would otherwise fall through the cracks, for humans to pick candidates for second exposure. These get a randomized shot at the front page long enough for the community to decide their fate. Most fall away quickly, but some get taken up, and so the HN front page sees more high-quality stories. It&#x27;s important to realize that this is a supplement to the ordinary mechanism of users upvoting stories from /newest. That works the same as always.<p>This is not a permanent system—just an experiment to gain information—and one lesson we&#x27;ve drawn from it is that moderators should not be doing all the reviewing. We&#x27;d prefer it to be community-driven, and anyway there are too many stories and too few of us to look at them all. At the same time, the results have been so salutary that I feel obliged to continue doing it until we can replace it with something better.<p>What system might we build so the community can do this work and we don&#x27;t have to? i.e. upvoting and /newest can&#x27;t do it, what could?<p>HN already has a mechanism for modulating the problems with upvoting: flagging. Where upvoting works worse than one would expect, flagging works better. (We do have to compensate for bad flagging, but surprisingly little.) But flagging only helps weed out inappropriate stories; it does nothing to help the best stories surface. So one thought is that we need a mechanism similar to flagging, but positive rather than negative.<p>As for /newest, if the problem is that there&#x27;s no incentive to do it, we need to make it rewarding. HN already has a reward mechanism: karma. Perhaps users who put in the work of sifting through new stories could be rewarded in karma [1].<p>Put these two thoughts together and the idea that emerges is of a story-reviewing mechanism, similar to flagging but focused on identifying good stories, where any user who puts in the effort and does a good job is rewarded in karma for service to the community.<p>The challenge is in defining <i>a good job</i>. It can&#x27;t be something you could write a computer program to do—short of writing a program to identify all the best stories, of course, in which case you deserve all the karma. If a story eventually gets lots of upvotes without being flagged, that would be one way of scoring a good review. But there need to be other ways, because there are many more good stories than slots on the front page.<p>And with that you pretty much have a core dump of our current thinking on story curation—subject to change as new ideas emerge.<p>1. HN could use a new way of earning karma anyhow. One common criticism, which I think has merit, is that the current system is a rich-get-richer affair where most gains accrue to a clique of old-timers and there&#x27;s little chance for anyone new to catch up.",1419367836

So I&#x27;m not opposed to &#x27;life of the author&#x27; terms for individual creators. On the other hand I see no reason why a dead author&#x27;s survivors should enjoy the proceeds of both the estate (if any) <i>and</i> economic rents for an additional average human lifespan (ie the 70 years provision in the US and other jurisdictions).<p>Where a work is the creation of an artificial corporation - like a motion picture, which is almost never the sole creation or intellectual property of an individual - I feel a shorter term should apply. After all, a corporation enjoys full legal rights of contract etc. from the day of its &#x27;birth,&#x27; and its &#x27;needs&#x27; are highly attenuated compared to those of a person - typically a small annual fee to maintain registration and fulfillment of an obligation to file a tax return. Its commercial &#x27;life&#x27; might therefore be thought of in terms of a business cycle or some standard established in law, like some multiple of the traditional 6-year <i>laches</i> term in equity law - a limitation on the time in which civil claims can be made.<p>There was an interesting case about this earlier this year, in which the Supreme Court held that the doctrine of <i>laches</i> did not apply in copyright claims, because the statute displaces it: <a href=""http://patentlyo.com/patent/2014/09/federal-supreme-holding.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://patentlyo.com/patent/2014/09/federal-supreme-holding....</a><p>...so anything like this would have to be put in place by Congress, which means the property interest of the general public with continue to come dead last for the foreseeable future.",1419367259

Many of them have nothing to do with the fact that the product is GMO:<p>* GMOs tend to promote monoculture and pesticide use.<p>* Studies have shown that the same developments that make GMOs more insect resistant can also make them more difficult to digest.<p>* When it comes to animals, GMOs tend to have much poorer quality of life and tend to be completely incapable of surviving without constant support (chickens who can&#x27;t stand on their own, cows who can&#x27;t go more than 48 hours without milking, etc).<p>* GMOs almost never focus on the true value of a food item, but rather the sell value. A food that looks nutritious is more valuable than one that actually is and GMOs make it easier to create that false association (deep red tomatos that taste like wall paper glue, etc).<p>It&#x27;s important to note that all of these things are really a byproduct of industrial agriculture, but many people associate them more directly with GMOs.

Joel refers to this as “muscle tone.” When he first began selling eggs to chefs, he’d crack one right into the palm of his hand, and then flip the yolk back and forth from one hand to another to demonstrate its integrity. The Filling Station chef called his staff over to admire the vibrant orange color of the yolk.

Any industry that depends so much on getting funding hardly seems like it would be especially meritocratic -- at least at first blush.<p>Fair point. Sports may indeed be fairer and more objective than other industries - results are easily measured, and are objective. And it&#x27;s clear that the tech industry is far from perfect. However, tech does have several things that make it fairer than other industries:<p>* You don&#x27;t need a degree to get into tech. Sure, it can help - the article here is about Stanford, one of the best places to study at - but the industry also has plenty of self-taught people. To at least some extent, talent can rise despite not having e.g. parents that can pay for college.<p>* The tools you need to self-teach are cheap, and getting cheaper. Personal computers are common these days. For comparison, some sports require almost no tools, but some do (e.g. skiing). Music is similar (some instruments are cheap, others not so much). But most careers don&#x27;t work that way. You can&#x27;t be a self-taught lawyer or doctor or soldier or social worker.<p>* Talent has the opportunity to present itself in an abstract way. You can create an anonymous github account and prove your skills, and no one would know any demographic information about you. Something similar has happened in classical music, with people performing behind curtains so as to remove any bias due to their gender or race, and it was very helpful there. For comparison, sports doesn&#x27;t work that way - you have to see people when they compete, so racial prejudice etc. might still have an impact. In tech and classical music, while things aren&#x27;t perfect, there is a fairly natural way to diminish such effects, simply let people only see the abstract result of their work.<p>* Some fields absolutely require a strong mentor, like in academia (perhaps also in sports? I don&#x27;t know). This disadvantages people that have a hard time finding such mentors, either due to prejudice on the part of potential mentors, or just a lack of connections, or weak social skills. In tech, some people benefit from mentors, but there are also lots of examples of people that have never had a mentor and do very well.<p>* Telecommuting is much more common in tech than other fields, even if it isn&#x27;t ubiquitous there. We have the technical capability to let people work from home in tech, in most roles, and it makes things fairer in many ways.<p>* You make a valid point that industries that depend on getting funding are less fair than others, all things being equal. However, tech has been driving down the amount of necessary funding, through open source software, things like AWS, etc.<p>Again, tech is far from perfect, and has many flaws. Still, it&#x27;s worth mentioning the good aspects.",1419366106

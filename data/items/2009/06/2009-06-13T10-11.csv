656040,comment,655889,655889,0,0,cpr,,,"Yawn. These stories are depressingly similar.<p>""I had a hit! I coulda been a contendah!"" ;-)<p>I think the whole world now knows that, if you build something good & it goes viral, you can make a lot of money for a while. Then, with the app store churn, if you don't get and stay in the top 10-25 app charts, and don't do serious promotion, your app is almost guaranteed to fade away.",1244890546

Stunt Pilot was designed to be a playable version of air racing.",1244890415

It's just begging for the political and commercial powers that be to stamp down on the web with a great, big boot.<p>Media corporations have already started demanding more control over the ""distribution channel"" that is the Internet. When the lobbying steps up, politicians aren't going to have to look very far for justification to give the corporations exactly what they want.<p></twocents>",1244889836

Repeatedly, with much work even predating 1.0.<p>iPhone development needs marketing, too.  Bad news, though -- it is all Apples garden and you are a bug in it, tolerated only to the extent the iPlant needs pollenization.  The user base is being taught apps are worthless and to expect massive churn.  This expectation cuts the knees out from under developer originated marketing, which can take years to get right.  Plus, low unit price means advertising is hard to get right, and low perceived value means users cannot be bothered to install apps from outside the AppStore.",1244889007

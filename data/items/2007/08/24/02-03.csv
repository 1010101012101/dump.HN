46004,comment,45773,45946,0,0,menloparkbum,,,"I was an in-class advisor for this ccourse seven years ago. From personal experience, I'm not sure I'd recommend it. It is the sort of thing you learn on the job, anyway... and you get paid for it.  The higher paying entry-level jobs require knowledge of hairier stuff these days. VMWare, for instance, pays a much higher starting salary than either Microsoft or Google. However, I'm not sure what other courses one could take to prepare for this sort of work. It seemed like most of the CS students at MIT wanted to become lawyers or investment bankers (but, this was back in the dot-com bust).",1187924223
46003,comment,45698,45744,0,0,Afton,,,"Yes, if you writing in forth. I'm less sure that the bottom up approach that forth and lisp allow translates as readily into generalized research.<p>This is one of the ways in which programming is <i>different</i> from other research. In programming, when I define a term(/function/word), it bloody well means that. In linguistics, if I define a notion, well, whether or not it means anything at all is exactly the point of the research. ",1187924045

It shows commitment to the idea and the willingness to sacrifice your reputation for the idea (there is a cost to people knowing about your possible failure, and the cost of people you care about and respect of dismissing your idea).",1187923812

This has made me rethink taking a recent position with a large company. <p>Multitasking is a myth.  Editing code on demand is possible but to design a program is a process that requires all cylinders of the analytic and creative mind.  To be in the zone is almost like a trance where I could start speaking tongues at any moment.<p>\n",1187923654

45991,comment,45636,45636,0,0,staunch,,,"This is probably the most controversial topic possible here. There's nothing that could offend people more than the idea that deep down they might not really have the determination they think they have.<p>It's so easy to fool yourself into thinking you can have your cake and eat it too. How many people get into the upper-middle class lifestyle of a programmer and then are willing to go back to living like a poor college student? Very few. So moonlighting becomes a way of trying without taking the plunge.<p>Someone might say about quitting to do a startup: ""Yeah..maybe you can't diet without getting your stomach stapled, but I can.""<p>Eating a healthy diet and exercising might be similar. It's something that tons of people want, but so few are able to actually sustain over the long-term. I think a lot more people would successfully exercise and eat healthy if they didn't have day jobs. If they had plenty of extra time to go to the gym and cook meals. I think the same thing is true for doing successful startups, but to a <i>much</i> greater extent since they require so much more effort and time.",1187922859

I think you should develop an internal weighting system on extra information. remember nothing beats the information gleaned from your own experience. I cant remember where but I read somewhere that the plan is unimportant but the planning is invaluable. Dont keep a plan just keep on planning and implementing. Each new Oh Crap moment is just another input to the ever changing and improving planning implementing process. IMHO.",1187922646

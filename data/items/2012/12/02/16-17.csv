There's no option for switching backwards, however. The way I deal with that is to separate any xmonad specific functionality behind a prefix-key submap in my XMonad config.<p>Any hotkeys that don't take the prefix I can use on any OS, the ones that do are xmoand specific. To me this keeps things nice and organized, while still letting me exploit the xmonad-contrib stuff to the full extent.<p>For example, instead of mod-j/mod-k, I use the window navigation extension behind the prefix so I get finer control over focus navigation, <i>and</i> this makes xmonad function precisely like tmux just with a different prefix key.<p>Can you tell I hate context switching?",1354467066

(3) Opening my mind up to the possibilities. Learning and knowledge are never bad and it's not healthy to be overly sure of yourself.<p>Programming: (1) Getting into the functional programming mindset. I am not going to completely ditch OOp but there are times when I find functional programming much more intuitive. (2) Getting the basics of algorithms and data structures. This was a long time ago but I remember it affecting my whole perspective of what programming was about. (3) Implementing non-intuitive algorithms to solve hard problems, mostly still considered as research areas. For once the solutions were not ""obvious"" and a mechanical approach, however complex, was not enough. I started with game theory, and am now trying to get into machine learning and overall I'm finding this experience a very pleasant.

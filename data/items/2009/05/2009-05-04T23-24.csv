String theory remains a conjecture, and this is nothing more than conjecture built on conjecture. Passing it off as truth is quite unscientific. (But... very New Scientific. I've lost almost all respect for the publication. The quoted do deserve at least a bit of consideration for the possibility that the New Science article is distorting their quotes for sensationalism or due to lack of understanding by the author.)",1241481292

Edison's comment about 1% inspiration, 99% perspiration applies both to inventing and commercializing.<p>For myself, the inspiration of a product was instantaneous; the first working version took two hours; but it took a year of further iteration before my first sale.

593302,comment,593020,593048,0,0,Oxryly,,,"> C programmers have more freedom to arrange data in memory to exploit locality<p>I think just about everyone here is underestimating the impact of this one ""feature"".  Most optimization approaches are grounded in 1970s computer hardware, where CPU speed and memory speed were two aspects of the approach.  That's not the case anymore... memory access times absolutely dominate on modern hardware.  Just lookup the number of instruction cycles a cache miss takes for your favorite system.  Its appalling.<p>C and C++ have been able to stay ahead of the curve because they allow strict control over memory layout.  Ocaml is often brought up as a competitor, but storing a floating point value in ocaml requires a boxed pointer!  Nevermind trying to make an aggregate structure that includes floats and other types bundled together... everything will get boxed and the cache never stands a chance.<p>C and C++ are the only fully current languages that let you bundle your data exactly as you need it in as small space and in appropriately sized chunks such that memory access doesn't grind your program down.  Of course you can fail to take advantage of this ability and write slow code in C or C++; in which case you'll match the benchmarks for your other favorite languages and maybe make a blog post about it.  That'd be missing the point though...",1241479960

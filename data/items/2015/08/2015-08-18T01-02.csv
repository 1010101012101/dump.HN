B is not trying to discredit A&#x27;s argument by appealing to a logically irrelevant characteristic of A. Rather, B is using A as a counterexample for A&#x27;s argument.<p>But it&#x27;s not a counterexample. It would be if someone had said thieves are criminals, but no one did. We only know that from common sense outside of the syllogism.<p>Therefore the statement &quot;YOU are a thief and a criminal&quot; is a simple assertion without evidence within the givens, and making such a statement about the debating opponent and then concluding they are therefore wrong (&quot;there goes your argument&quot;) is in fact a solid example of ad hominem.<p>I strongly agree that this is a poor example of one, because it allows the sort of confusion that you point out -- it&#x27;s just not literally wrong.<p>As a footnote (and certainly not aimed at you), a very large number of people who forgot their high school lectures about &quot;ad hominem&quot; use the term to mean <i>any</i> personal attack or criticism, which I find exasperating at best.<p>Such mis-usage isn&#x27;t just language evolution in action, it is misunderstanding rhetorical concepts over 2000 years old, first stated in Greek and then Latin, and quite language independent.<p>It&#x27;s a shame.<p>But I digress.",1439862637

I don&#x27;t doubt Pixar could make good movies centered around more adult stories, but I think what takes from from &quot;eh&quot; to &quot;good&quot; or even &quot;great&quot; is when there are multiple layers to them, and the layers are subtle but powerful.  I think these subtler themes resonate with people as they have experiences that they can relate to them (which is why we can put them in kids movies with a more overt story, the kids usually don&#x27;t notice them because they don&#x27;t have an experience that resonates), but when they are overtly part of the plot, it comes across as heavy handed.",1439862552
10077177,comment,10070318,10073692,0,0,insoluble,,,"I certainly understand your point about certain things having insignificant effects. Positive actions too can be insignificant. There is a certain noise level which makes the little things inaudible. On another note, everything a person does, bad or good, should be understood in terms of magnitude. For this reason, the use of derogatory labels over categorical actions can be very harmful to society.<p>A fair part of what you are referring to seems to be a cultural thing. From what I have heard, in places like the UK and Japan, white lies are often considered polite. But in places like Germany, white lies may be considered rude and inconsiderate. The &quot;Does this make me look fat?&quot; is a curious classic example of a white lie solicitation. Perhaps it&#x27;s something of a game with an understood message of &quot;Do you love me enough to tell me what I want to hear?&quot;. It could also be rephrased as &quot;I&#x27;m feeling hungry. Would you kindly feed my ego?&quot;.<p>Back in the day I knew a compulsive liar who for each new person he would meet would make up a new and elaborate backstory of himself and his friends. The majority of what he would lie about could be considered white lies since they were primarily for showing off or for entertaining. The harm may be small, but it nevertheless does exist: A person&#x27;s worldview and understanding of reality is based in part on the stories he or she comes across. By being exposed to false tales, his victims were being given a false account of reality, which is almost guaranteed not to help them in the long run. They were investing time into learning a lie.<p>A similar phenomenon which occurs in the tech world is when someone who happened upon lucky fame goes on to tell everyone else how to make it big quickly -- but happens to leave out the details of the 10 failed startups and any uncertainty in the current undertaking. This gives people a false account of reality, which is sure to lead more people down bad paths than good ones.<p>Another case, which has been scarily common is when someone who was supposedly diagnosed with cancer or something tries some random remedy, sees a remission six months later and goes on to write a bunch of blog posts or even a book about this miracle cure -- but then you never hear from the person again. Hmm, one has to wonder, did the cancer really go away like this person told everyone? Or did the person speak too soon, and now out of shame avoids telling everyone that the advice was unfounded after all. I would like to believe that the harm here is obvious.<p>The three examples above have two things in common: They all involve a person trying to gain more popularity and self esteem; and they all involve implicitly giving others bad advice about life and reality. Hence, the liar gains while the greater society suffers.<p>BTW: I appreciate that you have brought up this overall topic. On many sites it is very difficult to find worthwhile discourse on important social topics.",1439862518

Most teams already have a sort of &quot;shadow roster,&quot; between their practice squad guys and the unemployed veterans and rookie free agents that are on speed-dial for when injuries or suspensions strike.<p>The NFL is, despite the bone-headed direction by the league office, a money-printing machine, and that&#x27;s with a season lasting less than half the calendar year.  There&#x27;s a big chunk of the sports year that is a complete waste-land, between the end of the NBA/NHL finals and the start of NFL preseason, and the American public is desperate for football.  Just look at how the completely manufactured Deflate-gate &quot;scandal&quot; has pumped up football, for all its ridiculousness.  The wear-and-tear on the athletes would be a problem for a late-spring/summer league schedule - particularly for any standouts that continued on to play in the NFL in the fall.  But there&#x27;s more than enough talent that&#x27;s just at the edges of NFL-levels to provide an entertaining product.<p>Of course, the bigger issue is that NFL players have probably the rawest deal in pro sports.  Mediocre veteran baseball players can command double-digit million, fully guaranteed contracts, while the average veteran NBA player makes something north of 4-5 million, also fully guaranteed.  Meanwhile, even star NFL players have the bulk of their contracts non-guaranteed, and can be cut with little liability if their production dips due to bad luck or injury, in possibly the most violent and injury-prone major sport, which leaves many ex-players walking vegetables.",1439862389

the VCs staying in business?<p>Reasons:<p>(1) The money comes from the <i>limited
partners</i> (LPs), and they are heavily
investors with big bucks.  We&#x27;re talking
billions, from university endowments,
state pension funds, sovereign wealth
funds (say, a fund run by a rich Mideast
oil country), some family wealth funds,
maybe some insurance companies, maybe some
hedge funds.<p>Of course, venture might hit a grand slam
with great returns, and no doubt each
venture firm that raises money from LPs
claims that they are a <i>top tier</i> firm
with great advantages and some great
investment themes that with their &quot;deep
domain knowledge&quot; and great business
experience and insight will let them get
much better than average returns.<p>These limited partners invest billions in
all good looking <i>asset classes</i>.  Venture
capital is regarded by the LPs as an
<i>asset class</i> but is relatively small.
So, for the limited partners, venture
capital is small potatoes and slips in
under the wire even if on average the
returns have been poor.<p>(2) The LPs have FMO -- fear of missing
out.  Due to the rapid progress of
technology, the Internet, etc., the
venture firms can keep telling the LPs
that &quot;This time it&#x27;s different.&quot; with some
possibility of being correct.  So, some
portfolio manager at an LP doesn&#x27;t want to
have to answer why they didn&#x27;t invest in
KPCB or Sequoia and, thus, missed out on
Google.<p>(3) The LPs are not good at <i>technology</i>
or able to evaluate &quot;ideas&quot; or look for
&quot;better&quot; ideas.  Instead, the LPs are
closer to traditional commercial bank
lending and private equity that put a lot
of weight on accounting statements and
don&#x27;t expect to evaluate ideas or
technology.  So, the LPs are not pushing
their venture firms to evaluate &quot;ideas&quot;.",1439860677

We have done studies with anywhere from a few hundred to a thousand+ participants, and hope to scale up beyond that as well, so cost at scale is a big factor. Today I came across bt.tn, and I love the UI simplicity of their product, but their prices are high, and it seems they don&#x27;t include SIM cards with their buttons. Particle.io&#x27;s prices are more in line with what we&#x27;re looking for (especially the $3/month data fee), but my concern is that (at least from their website) the devices still look like hobbyist electronics with PCBs still visible, rather than like simple consumer devices.<p>Does anyone have suggestions for something with the UI simplicity of Amazon Dash or bttn but without bttn&#x27;s price point? (Or feel like making us 500 or 1000 such things? The economics can totally be worth it.)",1439860548

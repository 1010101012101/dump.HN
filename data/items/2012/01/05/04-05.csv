3427456,story,,,3,0,bglenn09,"Ask HN: Where to look for intranet work? ",,"I spend a lot of time on here and I'm hoping to get some advice. I'm in my mid-30s. I've started several start-ups since I graduated college, none of which achieved any traction. I've been working a full-time job for the last few years developing and managing the internal business process systems for a manufacturer. I'm now trying to transition back to the start-up world and am looking to rebuild an income flow to support myself. After many years of being out of the freelance game, I'm looking to restart a freelance practice which would buy me the flexibility to work on another start-up if I could even secure the rates I billed 10 years ago. My concern is picking up work, as many years of working in almost masochistic isolation on various start-ups has left me without much of a professional network and my skill set is lacking in sex appeal. While I am well-versed in Javascript and I'm currently studying Ruby, my background is in the pretty staid world of SMB line-of-business applications (and Microsoft technologies). While I'm sure that there is still plenty of demand for these kinds of intranet applications, I'm not quite sure how to break back in. I've been looking at postings on craigslist and some of the other boards mentioned here, but most listings seem to revolve around consumer-facing web apps. Does anyone have any suggestions on where to look online or what sort of events I should be looking for to network myself to find these sorts of gigs? I suspect start-up community events will not lend themselves to finding this kind of work. I'm in New York City. In the event anyone on here has work, I also have experience with SMB ERP systems (my first start-up was an ERP as a service flameout) and am very strong on business and financial analysis (I'm trained in finance) as well as project management stuff like gathering requirements and writing specs. Thanks very much for any guidance.",1325738910

So the robber takes the phone as well, and the person calls it in 15 minutes later when they get to a phone. When the average police response time is about ten minutes, the difference between a call being placed 30 seconds after the robbery and 15 minutes after is pretty much nil.<p><i>Additionally there are sadly instances where the theft at the ATM is just the start of other crimes towards the victim.</i><p>True. So maybe the advantage here is that the police are alerted to the fact that a crime is taking place. But let's say the victim is kidnapped or something at this point. Are the police going to be able to do anything? They'll show up 5-15 mins after the emergency call and find an empty parking lot. What then?<p>I guess this might be helpful for situations in which the robber takes the money but then hangs around the ATM to beat or rape the victim. But I doubt this is terribly common. And as soon as it becomes commonplace for people to have duress codes, they'll start taking the victim elsewhere instead of staying near the ATM. Or they'll just kick the shit out of the victim to impress upon them the foolishness of using such a code.<p>Actually, that's an interesting thought experiment. You're held up at gunpoint (or knifepoint) at an ATM. You have a duress code (that you remember). The criminal knows these are common and threatens you not to use it. Do you?",1325738283

It can have only one feature.  It doesn't need social sign in buttons.  It doesn't necessarily even need graphics except where they are required by the application.<p>The point is to be able to put forth a feature to potential customers that will either save them time or save them money.<p>This allows you to get your product in front of customers as quickly as possible without worrying about anything other than ""the app"" that you can sell.  If you can get your customers to open their wallets for ""the app"", then you can get after everything else.<p>Depending on where you're at in your lifecycle, that may obviously vary.<p>If you're pitching to investors, or if it is a social app, then obviously design matters significantly more.  Fluff matters more.  In social apps, or user-facing apps, design is often either a key differentiator or even a feature.<p>If you're launching in a space with a proven market, then MVP takes on an entirely different term.  You don't need to see whether or not people will pay, you just need to figure out how to get them to pay for your app versus existing competitors.<p>In your case, your focus should shift dramatically, and should instead be very polished, if not close to perfect.  Not being the first mover means that the market is at least tested, if not proven.  If there is somebody doing the same thing, then you need to launch as close to perfect as is possible while being quick to get to the door.<p>This isn't necessarily an easy task, which is generally why the ""get to MVP as quickly as possible"" is such an important goal, and why that mantra is so often repeated by seasoned entrepreneurs, venture capitalists, industry experts and analysts alike",1325737754

I had given the tutorial previously and thought that I would prepare by writing a book. Well, the book was published in November, the conference was in July. Yes it is hard work. Especially when you have a full time job and family.<p>Amazon really wants ebooks to be priced under $10. Hence the 70% margins from $3-$9.99. The Hockings, Lockes and Konraths who spit out a novel a month can go down in the $.99 - $2.99 35% margin and make it back by selling 50K copies a week. I don't know that any technical book sells that much in a month. Hmmm, maybe technical books aren't exciting enough and could be spiced up a bit.<p>WRT formatting, I ended up writing my own restructuredText to epub converter[0]. I format my html specifically so it will go through KindleGen and make acceptable mobi's. (I'm convinced that the author(s) of KindleGen outsourced every other line of that program, then blindly merged them together. I'm not sure how else it could generate such horrible markup... A first year intern should be able to do much better in a month of a summer). Then I also created a mobi/epub friendly css project that has had some contributions from professional ebook creators. [1]<p>It took a lot longer to write than I would have thought, I had an in-law that writes grants for a living give it an overview, and then got a professional Python editor to give it a wonderful overhaul.<p>I did cover design myself with Inkscape. It's OK, better than a lot of covers, but not stellar.<p>As for distribution, e-junkie has a horrible interface (for admins) but does the job for self-distribution. Amazon has about 60+% of the US market, so even though mobi sucks, I put all my focus on making it look great on the Kindle. (In fact I'm in the middle of another book on mobi-friendly epubs) Getting published on KDP is easy, no ISBN required. BN has another 20% of the US market, pubit also easy, no ISBN required. Apple is a pain, and from my research most ipad users buy content from Amazon... Smashwords is fine for novel writers but requires writing in Word (at least until mid 2012), so I just can't justify spend time tweaking Word documents, for a book on Python where it is imperative that spacing and whitespace are correct, for a small slice of the pie. If Smashwords accepted by epub or mobi, I'd put it up there yesterday.<p>I'm horrible at marketing. Getting reviews and feedback is longtail behavior. Send out 40 copies to people who say they'll give feedback and maybe one or two will respond. (Maybe my peer group is bad) I need to spend more time prettying up the website and on marketing, but I feel good about my book and the reception it has gotten.<p>Yep it is hard work, but for some reason I'm in the middle of writing two more books.<p>0 - <a href=""https://github.com/mattharrison/rst2epub2"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/mattharrison/rst2epub2</a>\n1 - <a href=""https://github.com/mattharrison/epub-css-starter-kit"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/mattharrison/epub-css-starter-kit</a>",1325736579

3427330,comment,3425973,3425973,1,0,jarrettcoggin,,,"I really do agree with a lot of the points you made. The one thing I think you failed to mention was that the in the past, these same companies that are backing SOPA/PIPA fought previous technologies, such as public radio, VCRs/DVD Burners, and DVR/TiVo. Ultimately, those channels did not hinder or kill the industries they are fighting to protect, but rather provide them new methods of distribution and new sources of revenue. They can choose to spend that money on technological improve rather than on lobbying/litigation/drafting legislation. We already see companies embracing the new technology and making great improvements (Apple with iTunes, Pandora, Spotify, etc.), but the other companies aren't keeping up with or using the technology to remain in the game and/or relevant until they have no other choice.<p>Another point a coworker made is that we are squeezing the inefficiency out of these systems. Models of business that worked well 10-50 years ago don't work nearly as well or at all now because there is technology in place that eliminates the need for some or all of the distribution methods in place that they are trying to protect.",1325736143

It really makes you appreciate the fact that what we consider ""thinking"" and ""decision making"" are usually just sequences of lazy cognitive biases that [poorly] approximate solutions for substituted questions. Unfortunately, I suspect that there already is a response bias to the readership of that book, since only those who are willing to question their own thinking process and metacognition would be interested in this kind of book.",1325736133

I think the pattern should be: ""Company X gets shut down because one of its customers broke Law Y at the expense of Company Z"".<p>And the best Company X I can think of is a sports franchise. (A customer base that is too large to monitor in real time, and that forms a community that would get shut down along with the business.) So what are Y and Z? I don't think they even have to differ from the reality. ""Imagine if the government shut down the Boston Red Sox because one of its fans was handing out ripped Beyonce CDs.""

A trivial look-alike implementation of std::string can be written in C, and would look a lot like the RString class.<p>Your argument is actually, essentially mine. The need to use the platforms' string functions heavily swings (but does not force) the choice of null-terminating the RString members. As I mentioned, it would be really stupid but <i>entirely possible</i> to simply clone the non-null-terminated string into a temporary null-terminated char array every time you want to use a function that takes standard ""C strings"" if you really, truly, madly wanted to have an RString implementation that was one byte smaller to store.

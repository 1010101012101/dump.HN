The entire state of california (not exactly high density at all, given the bulk of the state is just open space) has an average population density slightly higher than Spain, a country that managed to build a national High speed rail network.<p>The entire eastern sea-board is at roughly european density levels as well.  No one is suggesting we build a bullet train that goes to North Dakota.<p>As for ""not being profitable for another 20-30 years"", you are arguing from a very short-term mindset about national infrastructure, but also you are pre-assuming that infrastructure should be directly profitable.  This is not a commonly agreed idea, rather there is fierce disagreement between fiscal conservatives who think the government shouldn't do ANYTHING, and those (like most of europe) who believe the government should undertake large ""public-good"" projects precisely because they are not directly profitable, but they are PUBLIC GOODS.<p>Universal health care is also ""not profitable"" directly, but the benefit to society of having everyone live decades longer is massive increased economic output, to say nothing of increased quality of life.<p>The network effect of having efficient rail transportation balloons the entire economy.

If you look at the way the arm moves it is actually quite comparable to the arm of a baby that moves an object to its mouth the first couple of times.<p>With one big difference, a baby may get it wrong but it is not strong enough to do too much damage, even if it pokes itself in the eye every now and then it is usually with very little force. This arm however looks engineered to be strong enough and fast enough that it could do real damage to the operator or its environment. If that's servo driven there has to be a whole slew of safety systems in case a driver decides to hook a motor to V+ or V- because of a blown FET.<p>In any real-world machinery situation where the machinery is under software control and has the capability of doing real harm (for instance: machine shops with CNC gear) there are normally countless interlock systems that you'd have to bypass before you could get yourself in contact with a piece of it moving under control of the computer. In this case the operator is extremely exposed and I cringed when the arm sped up towards her face with the bottle. I also found myself sort of 'willing the bottle' in the right direction, they way some movies will have you react to something on the screen. Hard to describe.<p>This is not a soft hand moving either, it looks like it is made of pretty strong aluminum and fairly heavy.",1337238946

At 2 years old they're sitting at somewhere around 30M users, even Facebook didn't grow that quickly (per your own graph).<p>In addition, Pinterest sits much closer to transactions than Facebook does. Facebook currently makes around $5/user/year, just given Pinterest's proximity to the transaction its relatively easy to imagine how they could hit a 3-5x multiple of that. It's feasible that Pinterest could hit Facebook style revenues at 1/4 of Facebook's userbase, and they are already 1/30th of the way there. With this investment thesis $1.5BN is a hell of a deal.<p>Right now I think there are only two real major risks (neither of which I personally believe to be true): 1. Pinterest may be a fad with no staying power. 2. Pinterest has a much smaller target demographic than Facebook and their growth may soon cap out.<p>With regards to your argument about Pinspire that's just bogus. There were plenty of Facebook clones that got early traction in other markets, none of them won.<p>You may be direct, but you're getting down voted because your 'argument' is nonexistent and lacks any real substance.

I worked on the smart refinements team, which shows relevant categories and refinements on the left hand side of the search and browse pages.<p>Broken price sort is a common complaint both inside and outside of Amazon. There have been email threads, tickets, and half working solutions to this but nothing -- so far -- has worked well enough.<p>First of all, no engineer at Amazon would tell you that the current state of price sort is acceptable. It is a well known problem that gets worked on from time to time (In fact, better price sort was going to be my next project before I left so, uh, sorry Internet...). The current price sort has been around for a long time and nothing has outperformed it.<p>Amazon can't sort by price well for several reasons.<p>1. What do you mean by price?<p>2. Low cost accessories<p>3. Bad item classification<p>4. More things that I can't get into<p>1. Price is hard to figure out. Do you want to sort by the base price of an item, the price plus shipping (which depends on where you live), or the price after discounts or specials? What about products that are sold both by Amazon and third party sellers, where the 3p seller charges less for the item but more for shipping than Amazon? Which price should be shown?<p>2. Low cost accessories dominate searches for a product. If you search for ""iPod"" in all-products search (APS, the default search on the front page) then you get pretty relevant results that span a few categories. To sort those you first need to select a category (we'll get to that later) and then sort by price. If you select electronics you'll see a few relevant results and a ton of accessories.<p>You could argue that Amazon should have better algorithms (and that's probably true), but there's only so much you can do. If you <i>really</i> want to sort by price then you shouldn't care about the relevancy of the results. To argue otherwise means that you won't have results that are increasing in price as you scroll down. You'll see more relevant but more expensive results at the front.<p>3. Both 3p and internal item-to-category classification continues to be a struggle at Amazon. I knew several people on the team that helped improve item classification while I was there and they did great work and made huge improvements to the catalog accuracy. Amazon has systems that learn the correct classification and suggest the correct categories to 3p sellers. Unfortunately, you'll still find sofas in the electronics category. This really screws up the results. Your outs are only as good as your ins.<p>4. There are some fundamental design choices that make solving this issue really hard. I obviously can't go into such fine detail, but try to appreciate that really smart people are working really hard so you can buy the lowest priced product as easily as possible.<p>In direct response to the article:<p>> Why would Amazon fail badly at something that seems so simple? The immediate cause is probably caching. Amazon likely has a task that periodically caches the low price for each item.<p>Well, caching is used extensively, but this probably isn't why the results look like they do. See #1.<p>> Tellingly, if you search for items without many Marketplace listings, the price sort is much more reliable.<p>Again, that's because if you exclude marketplace sellers the price is easier to calculate.<p>> Perhaps they can stop trying; why not just exclude Marketplace items from the price sort calculation altogether?<p>Seriously? Exclude a huge portion of all the products sold on Amazon? Crazy.<p>Price sort is hard. Just sort by popularity.",1337238708

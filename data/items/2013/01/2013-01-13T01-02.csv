5049667,comment,5044669,5046768,1,0,glenra,,,"Regulators want to make sure, above all, that the drivers are paying taxes and paying for the use of their vastly (and artificially) expensive taxi medallions. So the regulations tend to require the use of an expensive and finicky and limiting piece of equipment - a taxi meter. Private jitneys don't need a meter, so they're immediately less expensive. The private alternative to a meter that works as well or better for a nearly zero cost is a ""zone card"". Draw a stylized map of the area divided into ""zones""; there's a fare for within-zone travel or a higher fare to cross some number of zones to get to another area. The zone map and price schedule can be printed on a card handed to the passenger or (where jitneys are legal) put on a sticker on the door of the car, so the passenger knows the charges before they get in.<p>Now the cab driver has no incentive to avoid passengers who want to cross a bridge to a less profitable area (ever try to get a cab to Brooklyn from downtown manhattan?) and no incentive to take the long way around to bump up the meter charge in slow periods - the driver's interests and the passenger's are aligned. Better yet, drivers have the flexibility that they <i>can</i> negotiate other fares when that's appropriate - for instance, charging more in a hurricane.<p>Rigidly fixed prices are NOT a good thing for customers if you want there to be service at any time to/from any region. Fixed prices mean many areas get little or no service - the cabs stick to the more popular routes and people who live in poor neighborhoods get shafted.<p>The regulations on cabs are not at all utilitarian - they are pure rent-seeking. Concentrated benefits accrue to the few who own medallions; distributed costs are paid by drivers and passengers everwhere.",1358042350

The story of the US withdrawal ( <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_withdrawal_from_Saudi_Arabia"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_withdrawal_from_S...</a> ) reminds me a lot of the resolution of the Cuban missile crisis, where the US quietly agreed to withdraw similar missiles from Turkey and Italy.<p>To the extent that bin Laden's ultimate goal was to cause severe financial damage to US interests, there's no question but that he succeeded grandly.  Sure, 99% of the damage that resulted from 9/11 was self-inflicted by the Bush administration, but the outcome was the same as if bin Laden had destroyed trillions of dollars in US wealth himself.",1358042227

If the solution was to double down and power through I'd have cured my own depression years ago.<p>The shitty thing is that it's a long-living subconscious emotional drain. It's a downward slide that for me happened so slowly I didn't even notice until I'd lived at the bottom, completely burned out on life and barely functional for two years.  It's not only a mental disorder, it's technically called ""psychomotor depression"" because it will by degrees affect mind and body in a downward spiral.<p>I've never lost sight of the bigger issues, the disorder and opportunity for change in world-at-large, but it's impossible to make meaningful progress toward /anything/ whilst waking up every day with a gnawing emotional emptiness and pain thrusting itself into the center of my consciousness.  It's care about those bigger issues and for my family that has kept me in this world.<p>My point is this: whether you mean to or not, you suggest that people can get themselves out of depression. In general, this doesn't happen. Therapy, medication, and support of friends, combined with healthy living have begun to move me forward in my own struggle.<p>I hope to see in my lifetime an elimination of the social stigma of depression. We're not miserable entitled bastards that need a reminder of our incredible opportunities. We're folk who feel sad and whose brains work in a way such that we can't always see the way forward.

(indeed as this man asserts, there is reason to question that as well) I am simply stating an observation based upon the following;<p>a) the prosecutor's office has limited, finite resources to pursue cases<p>b) The prosecutor has discretion over the choice of cases<p>c) The office is judged by its record when it comes to the number of convictions and the quality of the cases pursued<p>d) It is reasonable to assume that the prosecutor acts as an agent, pursuing their own agenda versus the spirit of their duties. (the principal agent problem)<p>e) The legalities in Aaron's case are complicated and understood by a few.<p>f) It is also reasonable to assume that the case is inherently more risky than an open and shut guilty conviction, due to various factors such as, 1) the desire of MIT, JSTOR not to prosecute themselves, 2) expert witnesses such as the author of the article willing to provide testimony against the case, 3) the lack of a direct victim, and 4) questions over the inherent legality of the action itself.<p>g) In the above context it is reasonable to assert that the prosecutor without their well established tricks may have indeed lost this one if Aaron had the resources to have his day in court.<p>h) Aaron has a demonstrated previous track record of acting against the interests of the US govt. and the <i>individuals</i> it consists of.<p>i) Those individuals within the government have a social network<p>j) The said individuals are capable of and are willing to influence one another through this network<p>k) The prosecutor is a part of such a network by her very position within the government.<p>It is therefore reasonable to assume from the above assertions that it is likely the prosecutor was influenced to pursue the case with more rigour than necessary.",1358040624

5049539,comment,5048699,5049354,10,0,alexqgb,,,"None of this has any bearing on the pre-trial tactics that are being used with increasing abandon by the DOJ. Specifically, they seek to prevent defendants from having their day in court by making any defence ruinously expensive. An even nastier version of this tactic involves freezing a defendent's assets, making the retention of competent representation a fiscal impossibility. Having effectivly stripped a target of their Constitutionally guaranteed right to a fair and open trial, they credibly threaten their victims with insanely onerous penalties that can be avoided only by accepting plea bargains that involve consent to charges that may well be baseless. In other words, they've successfully undermined one of the nation's key checks on abuse of government power.<p>From what's emerged today, it's clear that the case against Aaron was weak at best, and highly unlikely to lead to conviction in open court against capable defenders. ""Bullying"" is an understatement. What's going on is an outright assault on the very core of restrained government. Whether this power is being used for good or ill is besides the point. Like extrajudicial killings, the power itself has been placed outside prosecutor's reach for a reason. They have taken it anyway, and they've done so because no impedement has been there to stop them. At the same time, they've depended in security through obscurity. A general lack of awareness as to how abusive and out of control they've become has enabled the rot we're seeing now.<p>In this case, we see the importance of open access to jury trials in that they prevent the government from harming its own legitimacy. Given how unrestrained the DOJ has become, it was only a matter of time before they suffered a high-profile screwup. And while Ortiz may simply have been the one unlucky enough to own it, she is very much a part of the problem. Unlike Aaron, she is not an unfortunate innocent caught in the wrong time at the wrong place. To the contrary, she is the fox sneaking into the henhouse on the night that a new watchdog is sleeping beneath it.",1358039037

I was talking about Appelbaum's mother, not Swartz's.

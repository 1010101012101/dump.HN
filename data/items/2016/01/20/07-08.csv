We are creating cards for bugs on a project but Trello cards are not well suited for that, neither to input bug reports nor for managing them.

10936562,comment,10934666,10935723,0,0,lutusp,,,"> I don&#x27;t really see sympy and the like surpassing Mathematica.<p>Given enough time, it will happen. There are several reasons. One, people who publish mathematics academically are reluctant to use a closed-source tool to create their results, because those results can&#x27;t be examined and verified at their source. This issue pushes people toward sympy/Sage/Jupyter and other similar open environments, even though at the moment they aren&#x27;t as powerful as the Wolfram environment.<p>For example, imagine that the four-color map problem (the first significant computer-aided result in mathematics) had been solved by a close-source environment (instead of an open, freely readable source as it was). If that had been true, people would still be arguing about whether the result was valid.<p>Two, an open-source environment like sympy attracts technically skilled people intent on improving it, knowing that they&#x27;re contributing to a tangible kind of progress that&#x27;s clear to everyone, and then freely copied by like-minded people into different environments, all with the intent to advance human knowledge, rather than make stockholders happy.<p>Three, this may not be apparent, but the existence of environments like Sage and sympy are putting tremendous pressure on Wolfram to price their products more reasonably. Instead, and so far, Wolfram&#x27;s strategy has been to design enticing free samplers like Wolfram Alpha as gateways to their expensive offerings.<p>> If when I&#x27;m buying Mathematica I&#x27;m paying for a proper implementation of the risch (integration) algorithm, it will have been money well spent.<p>This is a perfect example -- until Mathematica is open-sourced, no one can know whether the existing algorithm is either complete or optimal. Also, given that research into this algorithm has enormous practical value in both mathematics and computer science, it&#x27;s a shame that a large segment of the effort is being carried out in secret. I&#x27;m sure those responsible for its present form would love to publish their results, if only for the fact that this would get them fired and possibly prosecuted.<p>There was a time when people who made an original contribution to human knowledge would publish their results in the open (think Einstein) and take pride in their contribution to the common good.

For example, consider the contributions Faraday made to our understanding of electromagnetism. Although he never mastered maths, he broke the ground for many that followed him, most notably Maxwell. With Maxwell, you have almost the opposite situation, as he was a highly skilled mathematician: his insights were largely borne of mathematical abstraction.<p>So I think the best answer to the question is sometimes. Faraday&#x27;s insights were not (directly) dependent on advanced knowledge of mathematics, but Maxwell&#x27;s were. We needed the genius of both these men, but mathematics was only required of the second.<p>What should we do, then? Definitely require hard science majors to learn mathematics, even more so then currently. Encourage mathematicians to think about science problems, and vice-versa. But let us not make the mistake of closing the scientific doors on the so-called &#x27;mathematically illiterate.&#x27; For all we know, they carry the solutions to some of our most difficult problems.<p><i>Edit: changed &#x27;where&#x27; to &#x27;were&#x27;</i>",1453275806

Now, I don&#x27;t mean setting up a &quot;CI&quot; server to run tests for you when you push your code.  I mean <i>actually</i> merging your code with your fellow programmers every 20 minutes or so.<p>The reason this is such a powerful technique is that it gets people to see what you are doing pretty much as soon as you do it.  If you do something stupid (as we all do), they complain instantly because they will merge in your code every 20 minutes.  If you do CI well, there are no lingering surprises or hard decisions of &quot;Well, maybe you should start all over again&quot;.<p>The problem is that all the code is mixed up.  This is completely fine if you have 1 or 2 week sprints and deploy at the end of the sprint.  The problem is that this kills another really power technique called &quot;continuous deployment&quot;.  Ideally, we would like to deploy as soon as a story is finished.  But if it&#x27;s mixed up with a whole bunch of other code, then you need to make sure that the other code isn&#x27;t going to break something.  Enter feature toggles.<p>It&#x27;s a challenge to support both CI and CD at the same time.  You can never break any code.  It takes a lot of discipline, but if you can manage it, I guarantee pretty enormous improvements in both productivity and code quality (and even programmer happiness).

It&#x27;s fine if you&#x27;re the only one on a team following that model, but if everyone on your team follows that model, you&#x27;re delaying collaboration and causing merge debt.

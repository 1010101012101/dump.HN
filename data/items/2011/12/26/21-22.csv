I'd recommend sticking to a language you are used to and have experience with\n- Do those frameworks have an active open source community?\n- Are those frameworks headed down a path that coincides with where you want to do?\n- Do you think there's any possibility that in 1-2 years your code and the open source one have diverged in a way where it does not make sense for you to keep your project up to date with the one proposed?\nMaybe the most important thing for you and your project is simply the ability for users to be able to add each other as friends - and the rest of the features are custom ones, not provided by the framework.

Friendly ""Start Here"" button that explains the interface. And then it links to Hackety Hack, which is awesome, because _why's lessons are awesome.

Great packages!<p>But then there's inconsistencies. The glossary defines 3 terms, and then fails to define 7 more. The app seems confused, telling me all of the following:\n""This is KidsRuby""\n""This is Hackety Hack""\n""This is Ruby4Kids""<p>The tabs differentiating between ""Output"" and ""Turtle"" are an interesting concept. I'm of a mixed opinion there, but I see what you're getting at. I'd probably have argued against that as one tab or the other is potentially useless at all times.<p>Really, I have the same criticism to level at this as  Hackety Hack (and I imagine that is no small coincidence): it's a good idea wrapped in a terrible experience. It's not that it needs to be dumbed down for children, but it does need stronger guidance. It fails by giving too many opportunities for alienation and/or working just badly enough that users will get frustrated and give up.

I got quite a bit done with some languages based on basic and with Delphi, when I could finally understand some of the errors I used to get with Pascal.<p>Based on my experience, I'd say that errors you get help you with learning about languages that make those errors evident. I learned about recursion before I learned about getting the compilers happy, for instance.<p>It's funny though that I can count Python as one of the languages that I've barely used and learned simply because I was never too fond of it.<p>Anyways. I think Ruby is a fine language as it resembles basic and doesn't demand "";"" and parentheses, and it also has great OO support which helps with the documentation and even IDE support. With name completion, for example. Methods in Ruby are very straightforward and control-flow structures are plenty capable in Ruby. Not having to declare variables can also help, and Ruby does report some errors quite handily.<p>Cheers.",1324935748

3394005,comment,3393506,3393775,2,0,jnbiche,,,"I would argue that whitespace provides a visual cue to code organization that could prove critical to children learning to program.  To provide an (adult) example of what a little whitespace and DRY can bring about, I'll describe my struggles to learn to program fluently. From 1998 until 2010, I did web design on and off, even working as a professional web designer for a few years.  Although I was good at HTML, CSS, and design, I came from a non-CS background and struggled to learn Javascript beyond simple cutting and pasting of scripts and a little jquery.  I eventually learned enough PHP to begin considering myself a programmer (yes, cue the laughter), but it wasn't until I started to learn Python a few years ago that I experienced a breakthrough.<p>Now I'm fluent in Python.  After I was comfortable with Python, I went back to Javascript, via Coffeescript initially, and with the background Python provided, was able to grasp the fundamentals of Javascript to the point where I can now actually create full programs in JS.  Since then, I've been able to pick up some C and am making excellent progress with Haskell.  I attribute this programming epiphany to Python, and particularly to the visual cues that whitespace provides (along with ""explicit is better than implicit"").  Whitespace not only provides key visual cues to code structure, it also forces you to organize your code coherently before you can run it.<p>I've not learned Ruby, but I like what I've seen of it a lot.  I'd love to have the opportunity to use it one day.  However, I firmly believe that for some people at least -- including children learning to program  --  semantic whitespace provides critical visual and organizational pedagogical support.  For that reason, I think that Python, or even Coffeescript, would be a better first language for child (and adult) learners.",1324935669

3393979,comment,3392857,3393210,10,0,buritica,,,"Yes it is a widely used herbicide.. let me tell you a little bit about Roundup(TM). It is a wide spectrum herbicide that inhibits synthesis of some essential aminoacids. Basically, it prevents plants from growing, any and all plants that synthesize aminoacids like phenilananine and tryptophan. It does not affect crops because they have been genetically engineered to withstand the effect of glyphosate. I'll leave whole GMO conversation for another day, but the fact that the EPA has not banned it does not make it safe.<p>I believe the use of glyphosate in the US must abide by very strict standards and regulations. I'm sure its forbidden to fly around town and spray it on anything you feel like it, much worse if there is livestock, potable water, or human populations close by.<p>This does not happen in the Colombia (Disclaimer, I, just like torrenegra, am a Colombian entrepreneur residing in NYC, currently Lead Engineer in an NYC startup, formerly a Pharmaceutical Chemist graduated from the National University of Colombia, I also did a Bachelor of Science in Biotechnology in Sydney, Australia). The irresponsibility surrounding the crop-dusting practices in Colombia is inimaginable. After almost 12 years of cropdusting, the overall coverage of crops has grown. But instead, human populations have been affected, and the real impact on the dusted areas has not been measured. Logically, I can't imagine how 10 years of constant poison bombing the same areas can't have negative effects.<p>From the american citizens perspective, huge amount of taxpayers money has been spent and the goals have not been met. If there had been a reduction in the production of cocaine, this would've certainly been reflected in the street prices, it is my understanding that this hasn't been the case. We can oversimplify the problem, with the following analogy:<p>If you caught your kid doing cocaine, what would be more effective?<p>- Go looking for his dealer and putting him in jail.<p>- Getting rid of all the dealers in his neighborhood and school<p>- Waiting for all the coca plants in the world to be erradicated<p>- Actually talk to your kid, show him the real effects the drug has on his body and mind. Taking him to places where he can see the real effect that drug addiction has in society and people.<p>There are obviously thousands of variables that affect each path, but from a market perspective, if the demand for certain product is high, someone will find a way to supply it. After the demise of the large Colombian cartels, Colombian drug dealers have stopped trying to control the whole supply chain, that is why now its the Mexican cartels are now in an inner battle to be able to control the best route into the US. There have been submarines, there's mules, airdrops, fast boats, and a thousand different ways of to try to get cocaine into the US.<p>The big question here is, how do we reduce the demand for drugs?<p>Richard Branson's point is certainly interesting, and Portugal's attempt has been the only one I've seen to successfully reduce the demand for drugs.<p>Drug use is a personal decision, just like alcohol consumption and smoking are. Legal does not mean right, or ok. Tobacco industries are horrible monsters, and the problem of alcoholism is not brand new. It's a matter of education, of parents taking the time to explain to their children why anything in excess is harmful, even sugar. How narcotics are dangerously addictive, just like nicotine, and any wrong choice may take them down a path that will punch them in the face down the road.",1324934992

First, that a library contains many different algorithms in a single framework is not a negative, nor <i>bloat</i>. Second, there is nothing about random forest or neural nets that are any more practical than maximum entropy or any other learning algorithm.<p>The main researchers are both doing university research work, not building products. I'm not sure where the practical/teaching arguments come in, Weka is used in many different scenarios, including commercial systems.<p>A brief look at the documentation suggests that this package is not nearly as extensive as Weka. Startups might care about the licence being LGPL instead of GPL. I can't comment on convenience and performance without using it a bit, but I've found that other command line driven packages are very easy to use for exploratory type research work.",1324933224

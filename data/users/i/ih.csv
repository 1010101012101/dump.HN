iheartmemcache,,1115,4.70455,3,225,"Read this:  John C. Baez and Mike Stay, &quot;Physics, Topology, Logic and Computation: A Rosetta Stone&quot;, (2009) ArXiv 0903.0340 in New Structures for Physics, ed. Bob Coecke, Lecture Notes in Physics<p>I used to do software things, then I did some hardware things, and then I did some mathy/finance things, then I did some enterprise things, now I do a bit of some. I like to be the dumbest person in the room, because osmosis is a particularly effective way to learn. Losing at chess is fun but only if I can retrospectively analyze why I lost. I enjoy quotes like &quot;God made the integers, all the rest is the work of Man&quot; and IAS lectures.<p>personal email: andrew.nambudripad@gmail.com<p>I leave this as a resource for any undergraduates interested in the forefront of higher mathematics and theoretical computer science, watch this IAS talk: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O45LaFsaqMA then visit this page: http://uf-ias-2012.wikispaces.com/Open+Problems<p>This is the forefront of a unified approach- aggregating type theory, certain varieties of number theory, has grand implications on all varieties of set theory, and for you logicians out there, entirely operates under the premise that Godel&#x27;s 2nd incompleteness theorem is correct - i.e., first-order arithmetics is inconsistent. More importantly, you can still do important work in spite (or perhaps, because) of this limitation. CMU is doing amazing static analysis work, certainly, but despite its low rank, Princeton has tons to offer.<p>If you&#x27;re still an undergraduate considering graduate school, focus as much as you can on the algebraic (less so analytic) track of mathematics in addition to the standard CS courses everyone takes. Algebraic topology has a way of finding itself into type theory, and having a core knowledge will only enrich your ability to attack those problems from an unconventional approach.",1244181583,1452793560

7405156,comment,7403615,7405002,0,0,someguyonhn,,,"To your question: I censor myself on HN because I don&#x27;t believe Hacker News, which is often used by children and is a place that seems to wish to be more welcoming to women and racial minorities, is the right place to have an environment where swearing or using racially inflammatory language is okay.<p>Especially when readers don&#x27;t know my relationship to the subject matter, or my relationship to the individual I&#x27;m addressing.<p>To your point about relevance, I&#x27;m going to point out to you that zero people are actually advocating banning a word.  They&#x27;re saying &quot;hey let&#x27;s stop calling girls who express leadership skills &quot;bossy&quot; because that has negative consequences&quot;. To which I think the average person would probably be open to. They are advocating not using a word in the wrong context. Call kids bossy when they&#x27;re being brats, sure, but when someone, particularly girls are being leaders and doing the same things that boys are complimented for, don&#x27;t call them bossy.<p>#WhenSomeonesBeingALeaderDontCallThemBossy is a pretty long hashtag and a terrible way to quickly market your campaign. #banbossy is memorable, gets to the point, and can encourage a conversation.",1394902766

Otherwise, you&#x27;ll get just as much energy absorbed into your body as a wifi radio does from an FM station - not immeasurably small, but negligible. And don&#x27;t forget, that the car is tuned to the power transmitter and absorbs most of the field strength. Since they&#x27;re right next to each other in your garage, there won&#x27;t be as much power leaking out.<p>Edit: Your sources are terrible.

I&#x27;ll give you the cliff notes version<p>When handing over from one ATC to another, MH370 adopted the identity of another plane in the area, and the other plane switched off it&#x27;s transponders  (let&#x27;s call this other plane AB123). Leading to a scenario where the whole world is looking for a plane in the sea when it&#x27;s actually airborne, but just happens to look like another plane on radar, and they landed it at some backwater airport (AB123&#x27;s destination) that&#x27;s under terrorist control (for example, how big a team would you need to take over Port Blair Airport on the Andaman islands? I&#x27;m guessing not very many, and no would be any wiser if you ran it as normal)<p>But why do this? Because whoever stole this plane needs to be able to fly MH370 into someones airspace unnoticed to do something bad, and flight AB123 is scheduled to fly into that airspace sometime soon, but if flight AB123 had been hijacked, or had gone missing, it would raise alarms. But to the outside world, flight ABC123 is fine, it&#x27;s MH370 that everyone is worried about... but flight AB123 is MH370.<p>So where is AB123? I don&#x27;t know. Maybe thats the plane the oil rig worker saw crash, or maybe they figured out some other way to hide it. Perhaps both planes flew to AB123&#x27;s destination, but with one flying directly above the other so that it looks like one plane on radar (I don&#x27;t know how Radar works but this would work for a movie) Also, AB123 might not be a passenger jet, it could be a cargo plane, or some other kind of plane that doesn&#x27;t come with a bunch of passengers that people would miss.<p>Anyhoot, that&#x27;s my crazy theory and even I don&#x27;t believe it, but a small part of me hope&#x27;s it&#x27;s right because the people on Flight MH370 could still be alive.<p>At the very least, I think this is a good plot for a movie.",1394901980

So if they are &quot;Taking too much&quot; then it&#x27;s up to the celebs to call it quits or go on strike.\nStarving?  Lol ya get real buddy.  Live within your means.  Most of well actually lets be honest here, every last one of you make in 2 years more than most Americans make there entire life.  If musicians are struggling to pay rent, then move like the rest of us, or stay in your tiny closet and stop complaining.  And an fyi, sometimes the ghetto isn&#x27;t so bad either.<p>To put it bluntly.  I don&#x27;t feel one once of remorse for any one in the movie industry, music industry, or any one famous celebrity that charges retarded prices for the work they dare present to us.<p>Selling albums with 2-3 good songs and 12 garbage ones and then expect us to pay 15 dollars in the 1990s was a rip off, thats 5-7.50 for the 2-3 songs, now you have iTunes, and Google play store averaging .99 - 1.25 for each song.  That&#x27;s reasonable.<p>Movies you have to pay for, get 2-5 days to watch it, then it&#x27;s gone...  Really?  Why should I pay 3-7 dollars for a movie and HOPE I like it, and then it disappears automatically (for those that don&#x27;t know what to do to prevent this)?  Then you pay for it to keep it if you like it, now we are up to $20 for the same movie.  Again, back to the 19-25 bucks per movie/vhs/dvd in the 1990s...  Sorry but again I don&#x27;t feel bad.  We have been getting ripped off since the beginning, and now you are mad because we are lashing out back at the studios and industry.  Get over it.  Now if only we can figure out how to lash out against the Gas companies I would be all for it too.<p>We aren&#x27;t asking to be wealthy historically known or to be a legend.  We want better lives, ease of use, and not be charged an arm, leg, and our unborn child.  If it happens by chance or fate then so be it if we accept it.  We want to see content when it&#x27;s released not years or decades later.  We want the truth and information at our reach not hidden behind closed doors and manipulated before we see it.<p>The costs are so high because the studios know they can charge the prices, California movies arent even created anymore because of costs, celebs know this and ask for more cause studios are getting more, and at the end of the day its all greed and we the consumer get boinked at every turn for everything, and you dare condone us for pirating?  Hell TV Shows that are great are being cancelled because of your outrageous prices, and the consumer gets screwed out of a showed they spent time watching and now dont see it because its cancelled due to budget issues.  Excuse me but if it wasn&#x27;t for us you as entertainers would have no job, no career, no word of mouth, and guess what, if it wasn&#x27;t for our word of mouth you wouldn&#x27;t even be as popular as you are now.  You are naivete and ignorant to not think that without us there is no you.  And without you there is no studio lol.  It all begins and ends with us.  Without us you have no paycheck, and that forces you the entertainer to produce quality work that we will WANT to buy with our hard earned dollars.  Your hard earned dollars is for what a mere 3-6 months of work a year if you total up the hours of actual working.  Ours is week in and week out for the mass majority of us.<p>We aren&#x27;t destroying livelihoods, we are bettering our own and the mass majority.  The rich celebs you speak of aren&#x27;t the masses, or the majority, and you have your money and should live within your means, and maybe even perhaps getting with your rich studio executives and figure out a way to bring content to EVERYONE and not just the select few countries with a retarded delay on other countries and everywhere else, AND come up with an affordable REASONABLE price to make content digitally available for download for keeps not temporary, and that way there wouldn&#x27;t need to be this issue.<p>We aren&#x27;t ruining lives, maybe a shady business here and there, maybe cutting into those pockets of those who are making far too much as it is already, but that can all be avoided with affordable reasonable cost for content to be purchased for keeps.<p>As for congrats on making this public... Well you know what I am happy they did.  It makes the studios go back to the drawing boards on re-thinking about all the high end prices they charge for movies and such.  Maybe now they will see the wrath of those in other countries not able to see a movie until years-decades later and release content to every country everywhere and not just a select few.  Maybe now we will see artist in the US that are well known in other countries and those other countries will see our artist and they can generate more fame and &quot;fortune&quot;.  It&#x27;s a two way street.  There is always a positive and negative side to everything.  This I see only the positive side.  You like the movie you buy it after seeing it risk free.  If it&#x27;s a crappy movie you didn&#x27;t waste your hard earned money and can choose something else.  If you were too broke to ever see a movie well now you can.  Can&#x27;t see this movie in your country, well now you can.  Win, Win, Win.<p>Also don&#x27;t dare say 3D, and blue-ray discs are affordable.  That is grossly over priced.  I can go on and on, but I will stop here.<p>Point is make it affordable for purchase and reachable and accessible to everyone or you deserve everything coming your way and then some.

7405103,comment,7403615,7404185,1,0,someguyonhn,,,"This is a kind of long response.  But I hope maybe you&#x27;ll read through it. Just saying &quot;check your privilege&quot; is probably not the best starting point for the conversation, so I&#x27;ll try to do a better job of explaining. I don&#x27;t know if you are misunderstanding what is meant by &quot;privilege&quot; or not, but the privilege being talked about when someone says &quot;check your privilege&quot; in my experience are the privileges that come from being part of the, for lack of a better term, more socially accepted or socially powerful group.  Things like white privilege, male privilege, heterosexual privilege, you get the idea.<p>So regardless of your level of income or education, you can be, and probably are, still privileged in the way society sees and treats you.<p>For example, as a man, I pretty much never have to worry about being told I got a promotion because I was having sex with the boss, or that I&#x27;m only being angry or &quot;emotional&quot; about something because it&#x27;s my &quot;time of the month&quot;. Things that women have to deal with all the time.<p>Another example would be that I&#x27;m never worried wanting to have children is going to be seen as bad for business, and result in me being denied promotions or other advancement because of it.(Not to mention I&#x27;m statistically going to be getting paid more than women for doing equal work.)<p>Hopefully you can see how these are the type of privileges men, or another group of people in a similar situation, may never notice unless it is pointed out to them. Or they &quot;check their privilege&quot;.<p>In relation to Ban Bossy, an important example seems to be that I&#x27;ve been conditioned my entire life to aspire to be a leader: team captain, salesman of the year, best on the basketball court, you get the idea. And not once was I ever, or will I ever, be discouraged from asserting my leadership skills as essentially &quot;not knowing my place&quot; because I&#x27;m a man, which can be the outcome when we tell girls and young women to not be bossy or other similar things.<p>Maybe a good exercise for you, and for all of us, is to listen to what people are saying when they describe the privileges we have, or to ask them to explain better because we would like to understand. Depending on our situation, maybe we&#x27;ll gain a better understanding of our heterosexual privilege and being able to love who we want without having to worry that their gender will result in violence against us or them.

These are only useful for explaining which computation you&#x27;d like to happen when the program actually goes to carry one out - I&#x27;d like the number which is the same as the cosine function applied to 5, which tells it precisely how to compute that number (assuming it can build an algorithm equivalent to cosine). Of course, we could use another pure definition (that cosine of x is the same as a series expansion about x) to allow the compiler to replace the desired cosine function with something that has intrinsics on the system - evaluation a polynomial at the point 5.<p>So in essence, we can use functions as a tool to describe what value we want from the program (or various structural properties), in such a way that the compiler can correctly infer how to build an algorithm to do so, and tie it correctly in to our (actually) algorithmic code.<p>Minor aside: functions (in the math world) apply in contexts besides the real numbers, including being syntactic notation for binary numbers (or fields of order 2^n).",1394900465

And yes, I read the article, and went to the website, I know what it&#x27;s about if that&#x27;s your point.<p>Here&#x27;s my point:  bossy is not a sexist term, for example it&#x27;s used to describe poor leaders in environments like the military, where leadership is NOT just men.  Acting bossy is bad.  Subordinates hate it, and you can&#x27;t lead by rank alone.  It&#x27;s a damn good lesson.<p>Therefore, advocating for its banning (the movement is called Ban Bossy after all) is both unwarranted, and entirely unhelpful: because it&#x27;s a clear unambiguous word that young leaders get&quot; quickly to describe adverse behavior in a leader and it&#x27;s the proper English use of the word Boss to describe someone acting in a manner like a boss.  What word would you use to describe this adverse behavior?<p>And the &quot;Ban Bossy&quot; movements supposition that it&#x27;s sexist that it&#x27;s used to describe &quot;girls&quot; is unsubstantiated.  It&#x27;s a good word to describe behavior, if someone&#x27;s calling you bossy you need to do some soul searching if you want to be a leader.

Define the ranking function f(A)=0. Choose an arbitrary person besides A, call them B. If B > A then f(B)=1, else if B = a then f(B)=0 else f(B) = -1. Choose a third person C, different from A and B. If C > max(A,B) define F(C) = f(max(A,B))+1. If A < C < B or B < C < A define f(C)=0.5x(f(A)+f(B)). If C < min(A,B) then f(C) = f(min(A,B))-1. Continue ad nauseum.<p><i>Either it&#x27;s false that multiple intelligences exist, or it&#x27;s useless to single-dimensinally evaluate them.</i><p>Multiple intelligences probably don&#x27;t exist. But even supposing they do, claiming that the <i>domain</i> of a function is multidimensional does not disagree with my claim that the <i>range</i> is one dimensional.<p>Background:<p>A total order is a way of saying &quot;person A is at least as good as person B&quot; which obeys all the obvious laws. Person B can be either a real person or a standard of achievement (e.g. &quot;passing&quot;).<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_order"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_order</a><p><a href=""http://www.chrisstucchio.com/blog/2013/metrics_manifesto.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.chrisstucchio.com/blog/2013/metrics_manifesto.htm...</a>",1394899247

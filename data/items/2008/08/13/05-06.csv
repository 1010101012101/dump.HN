I was leaving for another job, and they needed someone with my skillset.  Well, I had a guy who was suitable working for me at the time, and I offered to rent out my employee at a below market rate.  They refused.  Well, I moved to my new gig and my side business slowed down, so when the recruiter who got me this contract gig called me asking for recommendations, I referred the guy who was working for me  (I wasn't exactly paying him a fair wage, and even at the poor wages I was giving him I didn't have many hours of work for him)  Anyhow, the company hired my guy through the headhunter (and liked him for more than a year) -  but they paid twice as much to go through the body shop they liked rather than going through my corporation.  It wasn't like the body shop was big... it was some guy running the operation out of his front room, just like my corp.",1218607193

What they do is build dazzling displays for it in mobile phone stores, positioning it as the lastest in cool gadgetry. And I must admit it really looks slick, in a ""I didn't know there was a new iPod that's kind of like a notebook computer"" kind of way, which I guess is exactly what they're aiming for.",1218606389

It's a retelling of the crimes and the ensuing trial of four African Americans who decide to use an obsolete legal defense that, once upon a time, legitimated chattel slavery to try to escape the death penalty.  It's surreal.  It may have themes in common with some very bad articles on reddit, but it is not one of them.  It's a false positive.  This belongs on Hacker News.",1218605586

""Looking like Youtube"" is not a compliment in 2008.<p>High quality at reasonable bitrates in Flash isn't difficult; you just need to use x264. ( 280kbps example: <a href=""http://norp.ath.cx/h264.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://norp.ath.cx/h264.html</a> )  Quality has improved quite a bit since that sample was made, too: <a href=""http://i35.tinypic.com/rk33wx.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i35.tinypic.com/rk33wx.png</a> (screenshot from 400kbps encode).  There's a reason a huge number of sites, both small startups to companies as large as Facebook, are switching to x264.<p>Drop by #x264 if you need more information; we're there to help.

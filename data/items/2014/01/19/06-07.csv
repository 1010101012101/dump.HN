And that statement goes beyond software.<p>On the other hand, it isn&#x27;t going to get worse either...!<p>I&#x27;m also in the group who thinks that many of the changes occurring with software today are really only done for the sake of change, to create work, and not actually beneficial. I think the newest trend of hiding UI elements &quot;because it looks better&quot; or &quot;for more screen real-estate&quot; (when screen resolutions continue to get larger) almost borders on being offensively patronising.",1390114798

7083678,comment,7081468,7082990,1,0,nikcub,,,"Ive been thinking about how to implement a dead mans switch for passwords or private keys. A remote server that is synced with your local login and will change the password to something random every x hours unless you &#x27;check in&#x27;. If you do check in, your password works, if you dont check in because you are being held or have had your phone taken away from you then it will change it to something random.<p>Problems to solve at the moment are the security of the remote server, recovery after you let go of the switch and how ti implement the sync (instead of a remote connection, something like a shared secret used as a generation seed, like RSA tokens, that only needs to be synced once).",1390114477

The more complex the material, and the slower it is to parse, the response rate drops dramatically further still because it will likely either be backed out of (ain&#x27;t got time for that), or more likely when the user is done with it they have lost all context. Those magical tabs you find sitting in the background hours later.<p>So you&#x27;re left with the highest response rate being towards short, sweet material that ideally panders to a bias, allowing the user to shortcut even more. This is true even on HN where trends come and go, people trying to evangelize some bias based on nothing more than a title or a skim summary.<p>All of this doesn&#x27;t even count astroturfing and sock puppets - the lowest common denominator ascension of content already makes enough noise.",1390114460

You have to generate the binding to your own proprietary legacy interfaces anyway, and lots of situations benefit from proper event handling and easy enough GUIs (esp. canvas graphics). And every enterprise GUI looks bad anyway, so complaints about Tcls' L&F were rare.<p>I think it missed some important opportunities, and was too focused on GUI stuff. And after all, the Perl/Python/Ruby bindings to Tk weren't that bad, either. In the early days of the web, tcl actually was a pretty good option (as a rival to Perl/CGI). And aolserver was pretty neat (still is, I'd say). But then it didn't go with the times, gtk/Qt stole the Unix OSS GUI thunder, RMS ranted against it, lua came along for embedded interpreters, Ousterhout moved around from Sun, to Scriptics to whoknowswhere It's easy enough to miss your window.<p>At least it's still more popular than Pike I wouldn't rule out a small comeback, there aren't any technical reasons against it, it's well maintained, fast, has a <i>very</i> good codebase etc.",1348869577

I still do that before I work the exercises for an online course.<p>Of course whether I finish the exercises before the lecture completes really depends on the course. If it is implementing a simple algorithm and devising some test cases for it then it is often the case.

4587787,comment,4586949,4587627,2,0,pasbesoin,,,"Admittedly, it may have been a bit trollish.  But I also think it may well have been a serious perspective on Apple's part.  ""Because we can"" seems to be a significant factor in their actions that has been increasingly publicly noted.  To some extent (and I've been around Apple products since the '80's), it always has been an apparent aspect of Apple's approach and perspective.<p>I don't know what happened internally (and Apple is well-known for lack of communication on such things), but they definitely shipped their Maps product with some significant shortcomings.  And they apparently (I'm not too familiar with this) didn't list and engage in some recent pertinent hiring until they shipped.  I wonder whether the delay in recruitment was in part to avoid spilling the beans on what was coming.<p>And I wonder whether they planned for their user base being forced to ""beta"" the thing as a source to rapidly identify and triage failure points.<p>As I recall now, aren't they also basing it partly off of open, public mapping data?  And if that is the case, what better way to force data refinement than to force usage of same upon the public (or a significant chunk representing their iOS 6 user base)?<p>Of course, they may not have suspected -- or communicated sufficiently, internally -- how bad things might/would be.<p>But, <i>someone</i> had to know about these problems, to a significant degree.  How else were they going to approach the attendant problems?  On the face of it, it smells like a beta -- certainly from a data perspective.<p>Image-wise, this is about 1 year after Jobs' passing.  And for this very image-conscious company, I wonder how things got to this point.  Certainly the pundits have been looking for signs of, erm, 'negative changes' including citing Jobs', erm, 'manic perfection'.<p>As for myself, you may be right.  I've been getting pretty ""quippy"" and at least somewhat sarcastic, lately.  It is probably time for me to give commenting a break, for a while.  And for that feedback, I thank you (seriously).<p>Regards",1348866322

You also don't have to step over every crack in the sidewalk to avoid bad joo joo.<p>Gruber uses these little patterns in version numbers, release dates, etc. to make predictions about Apple releases and drive traffic to his blog.

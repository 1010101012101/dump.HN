Thus, maybe 80% of the fraud goes away and 20% remains, but that liability is shifted to the consumer rather than the bank (who otherwise passes it to the merchant anyway).  If the merchant has reduced fraud liability, they may be able to offer lower prices.  So, in principle there might be a long-term win for the consumer.  In practice, who knows.",1336773536

I've used it on Android quite extensively and it really is a solid product. For mere 29Mb and even with spotty rural data connectivity I got through 750 miles of navigation recently. Priceless thing to have on phone and even the iPad for people like me who hang it in their minivans.<p>2) Better multitasking - Android 4.0 multitasking is another neat thing - the clearly labeled / visible thumbnails of apps and easy ability to get rid of them comes in very handy. The way iOS does it is complicated.<p>3) Widgets - enough said!<p>4) Bigger phone screen - 4"" seems like the minimum, all soft buttons will afford more screen real estate.<p>5) Better memory management - My background apps aren't killed as many times on Android whereas even with the upgraded RAM iPad 3 reloads Safari pages at least couple times a day.<p>6) App to app communication ability - Intents/Contracts style.<p>7) Better iPad notifications - eliminate alerts altogether and make the notification window span greater horizontal area on the iPad.<p>8) Bundle more useful apps with the OS - no alarm clock shipped with the OS, no podcast app for the iPad. Wtf?<p>9) iTunes sync is still very flakey - wired or wireless. I don't remember when it worked on its own the last time.<p>10) Swype - license Swype stuff, pretty please :)<p>11) Constant nagging for passwords for App updates - this bugs me a whole lot especially since I have a stronger password. Once I've setup a screen lock - this is fairly unnecessary.<p>I guess it would just be easier to stick with Android - by many accounts ICS is very usable on newer tabs, so may be I will try the Transformer TF300 out instead of waiting on iOS 8.",1336773445

Seems to me he is saying cars are about as good a deal today as they were back then. I do not find that ludicrous. The other point to be made about cars is that all those improvements do not really matter that much in terms of the value you are getting out of them, cars in the '80s got you from point A to point B just like a brand new one does today.<p>(To be completely off topic I would add that computerization in the modern cars has always been a concern for me, when a 2012 car's computer starts acting up in 2032 what are we going to do with them?

3961514,comment,3961063,3961063,5,0,chimeracoder,,,"One thing that's been key for me is namedtuple (in the collections module). It's immutable like a tuple, but the values can be accessed by name just as if they were object attributes built with the class keyword. It's great for creating generic functions (think Lisp and CLOS) instead of using Python's prototypical system. And since tuples can contain any objects and functions are objects, you can bind callables like lambdas to those names, which allows you to have 'methods' if you want as well.<p>That said, the standard library leaves something to be desired for the functional style. It makes sense for object-oriented programming to have non-mutating functions return the result and mutating functions return None (think sorted vs. sort), but this can get rather irritating when you're trying to write in a purely functional paradigm.<p>Also, am I forgetting my Python, or does it not have a great solution for appending to the front of a list? One thing I <i>love</i> about Lisp is that it's ridiculously easy to write (cons item some-list), or even (cons item1 (cons item2 some-list)). Doing the same thing in Python is irritating, because insert() doesn't return the result list.<p>...or maybe that's what I deserve for trying to write Lisp-like code in Python, anyway....!<p>EDIT: As noted in the comments, the '+' operator will suffice here. Though since lists are really arrays and not linked lists, this functional way of thinking will result in horribly inefficient CPython code.",1336771743

I don't know why exactly, but I've never used a version control system that made more sense than this. I never really felt like I'm home with Perforce and SVN. Neither with Mercurial, although Mercurial is better than most.<p><pre><code>    git remote rm\n</code></pre>\nThis deletes the reference to a remote repository. The difference between Git and SVN here is that in Git you can have <i>multiple</i> remote repositories with which you can communicate.<p>This comes in handy when pulling and pushing to/from multiple people. Imagine swapping code between you and your colleagues, doing experiments, doing code reviews, and so on. It also comes in handy when you're dealing with Heroku, or when you've got an ""open-source"" core that's pushed to GitHub and another branch with proprietary additions that you push somewhere else.<p>Also, all commands for managing these repository references start with ""git remote"" and to find out how to do something with them you just do ""man git-remote"".<p><pre><code>    git branch -D\n</code></pre>\nThis deletes a local branch. It has nothing to do with the above. It does not use ""rm"" because that can be the name of a branch and this command is heavily overloaded.<p><pre><code>    git tag -d\n</code></pre>\nThis deletes a tag. It is consistent with the above command, as ""git branch -d"" (lowercase D) is also supported, but uppercase D means that the deletion is forced, even if the branch was not merged. Again ""rm"" was not used, as that can be confused with the name of a tag.<p><pre><code>    git rm\n</code></pre>\nDeletes a file, but you don't have to use it. If you're confident about your editing skills, you can just commit all the deletions with ""git commit -a ..."" ... git will also be smart enough to detect a file rename, even though you did a deletion + addition.<p>""rm"" is also the name of the command that does the same thing in Unix, being associated with the removal of files.<p><pre><code>     git remote rename old new\n</code></pre>\nAs I said, ""git remote"" manages references to remote repositories. This just renames the reference named ""old"" to ""new"".<p>You could say that they should have used ""mv"", like in the case of ""git mv"", however this is not a ""move"" command. This is just plain renaming.<p><pre><code>     git branch -m old new\n</code></pre>\nThis renames the local branch named ""old"" to ""new"". It is indeed inconsistent with the others, but that's because the ""git branch"" utility has been overloaded a lot. This command does confuse me from time to time.<p><pre><code>     git mv\n</code></pre>\nLike in the case of ""git rm"", this command does a ""mv"", while registering the action in Git. It is also not necessary if you're doing a ""git add . && git commit -a"".<p>""mv"" does make sense here, as it is the name of the Unix command for moving files.<p>And a final tip for beginners: use the ""man"" pages. In a terminal input any of the following commands when you need help ...<p><pre><code>    man git-remote\n    man git-branch\n    man git-tag\n    man git-rm\n    man git-mv\n    man git-push\n    man git-pull\n    man git-reset\n    man git-checkout\n    etc...</code></pre>",1336771626

It was wrong, of course, but it was different from the usual ""there's never been a better time to buy... or sell!"" crap you heard from the real estate PR machine.  It was a pretty sober look at the numbers.<p>The argument boiled down to this - if you're going to compare current prices to the historical trend, you need to exclude the possibility that real estate was undervalued before you can conclude that current values are overvalued purely based on divergence from historical trends.<p>The paper argued that housing was historically undervalued because creditworthy people didn't have good access to credit.  A house required a 20% down payment, and banks (back when banks held a loan for the entire life of the loan) wouldn't allow income to debt ratios to exceed a certain threshold.  They argued that new methods to spread risk across larger pools allowed the extension of larger amounts of credit without a huge jump in risk.<p>An example was a loan made to two nurses with excellent credit earning a combined income of well over $200k, but who only had about 20K in down payment.  In the past, this 10K would have limited their purchase price to 100K.  Now, they could bid much higher - without, as the article described, a massive increase in risk to the lender, especially if that risk could be spread.<p>It was a well-reasoned argument, and I think what it missed was the profound level of corruption and dishonesty going on in the industry at the time.  As we all know now, and as our wise leaders like Greenspan should and could have learned while they were reassuring everyone things were just peachy, is that the ""two nurses"" example was not at all typical of these ""higher risk"" loans, and the ""spreading of risk"" was in fact a way of dividing up and obscuring risk to make horrendous loans look better (and package them up and sell them, and then bet against them).<p>But this phenomenon will probably continue.  Yes, housing prices are higher, but I suspect that once the dust settles, some of these ""innovations"" (my disgust with the industry makes it hard to use that word) may actually come into play.<p>In short, we may pay more for houses than our elders did, but we may actually have better, more efficient access to credit <i>in the long run</i> (I want to make sure nobody thinks I'm defending the antics of the banking sector during the bubble with this argument).<p>Oh lastly - I do apologize for no cite.

3961466,comment,3960488,3960488,7,0,jules,,,"Why do you need to transform to CPS? The answer to your question will depend very much on your answer to that question. In the extreme if you are not doing anything with the CPS form, then probably the best optimization of the CPSed form will completely undo the CPS, transforming it back into direct style. Of course if you are actually making use of the CPS form, that's not possible anymore.<p>Depending on why you want CPS, you can apply the following strategy:<p>Keep all code in direct style. For each function, designate a special return token CaptureCont that indicates that the continuation should be captured. The source of this token will be callcc. After each function call you check if it returned a token, and if so, extend it with the continuation for the rest of the computation. Then on the main() function of your program, pass the continuation to the appropriate place. This strategy avoids most overhead in the common case: one if instanceof check plus a branch per function call.<p>For example, take this function:<p><pre><code>    def foo(x,a):\n      y = g(x)\n      return y+a\n</code></pre>\nTransform to:<p><pre><code>    class CaptureCont:\n      member target # the function that we will pass the continuation to once we finish constructing it\n      member partialCont # the part of the continuation captured so far\n      def extend(f):\n        newCC = new CaptureCont()\n        newCC.target = target\n        newCC.partialCont = lambda v: f(partialCont(v))\n      def invoke():\n        target(partialCont)\n\n    def foo(x):\n      y = g(x)\n      if y is CaptureCont:\n        # now y is the part of the continuation captured so far\n        # our job is to extend it with our stack frame\n        # and then return it so that the callee can build it up further\n        return y.extend(lambda y2: y2+a)\n      else:\n        return y+a\n</code></pre>\nInstead of just invoking main(), do this:<p><pre><code>    loop:\n      v = main()\n      if v is CaptureCont: v.invoke()\n      else: exit(v) # well I guess this is not necessary in JS\n</code></pre>\nEventually the CaptureCont will bubble up to main, and at that point main will invoke it so that the continuation is passed to the right target.<p>Callcc:<p><pre><code>    def callcc(f):\n      cc = new CaptureCont()\n      cc.target = f\n      cc.partialCont = lambda x: x\n      return cc\n</code></pre>\nThere are various optimizations that can be applied (like eliding the capture code for functions that you statically know don't call callcc and thus will never return CaptureCont), and this approach also (trivially) works for the more general delimited continuations. As described capturing the continuation is O(n) in the size of the stack. You can make it amortized O(1) with some more trickery by lazily rebuilding the stack, but the current approach is already blazingly fast in the case of no continuation capture. I'm really tired now, so there are probably lots of errors in the above description, so tread with caution. I don't know if this approach is new or not, but it probably isn't given that it's a fairly obvious approach to capture the stack. Does anybody know what it's called? Then the OP can find a better description.",1336771266

For successfully employed people people committing white collar crime, there is evidence that prison does in fact make them stop committing crimes.

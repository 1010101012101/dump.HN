As far as social and business norms go, thanking someone for a lead and saying you'll follow up as soon as possible (even if that's unlikely) wouldn't be considered lying, unless you're being overly pedantic. =)<p>It's also hard to see how this advice wouldn't be the optimal behavior in most or all situations. Almost all the time, communication is as much about how the communicators make each other feel as it is about the information being communicated - hence the smiley in the previous paragraph. =) The advice in the article is just trying to point that out in the case of someone offering you a sales lead.",1237186255

Living in developing countries would cost even less (at least if one doesn't insist on 100% equivalent quality of life).<p>Disclaimer: we're based in the valley and are happy for it, but that's because we're profitable anyway.",1237186036

517849,story,,,6,2,qbert,"How to structure start up with partners who already own a business?",,"I'm forming a partnership with a friend to develop an internet application. My friend already owns an LLC equivilant business together with a partner in Eastern Europe. Their current company develops applications for various clients and employs about 15 programmers.<p>Our new partnership will develop an original application. I will have 50% ownership and the remaining 50% of the company would be split evenly between my friend and his business partner. I was thinking we would start the business just as a general partnership in the beginning and then possibly incorporate it later in the U.S. (I'm based in California).<p>What I'm wondering is whether the business should be structured with my friend's current business entity as my partner or with my friend and his current partner as individual partners in the new business. Or does that even matter?<p>We will be dividing development costs evenly. Most of the actual development work will be done by one or more of their current employees although I personally will also work on some parts of the code. My half of the development costs is based only on the actual costs for them to employ the developer calculated on an hourly basis. (So it doesn't include any profit for them as one of their typical client deals would.) Any work I or the two partners do on the app will be uncompensated directly. We will split any future profits.",1237184814

517846,comment,517747,517747,0,0,gord,,,"I now think lisp variants like scheme, CL and arc allow you to write code that reflects how you think about the problem at hand, with much less boilerplate than C, C++ or Java. Performance is good enough, and the repl is a very effective RAD tool.<p>Ive heard the same about Python, ruby, ocaml, F#, Haskell etc.  After years of C and C++, I just cant bring myself to use the 'end' keyword, which rules some of these out.<p>Im very impressed with plts mzscheme command shell.  The docs are excellent and clever blog articles abound for scheme.  It seems a good way to learn a lisp while getting real work done.<p>I do wish there was a #lang arc 'personality' to provide the Arc language from within plt itself - that would be my dream machine.",1237184623

517843,comment,517053,517403,0,0,demallien,,,"Oh, Gandalf definately wasn't human - even the LotR itself was surprisingly clear on this point, considering how much magic was presented obscurely in the book.<p>On the otherhand, I would have thought that LotR was the perfect refutation of Pratchett's thesis - I mean Galadriel was one of the bad-asses on the White Council, with ambition to boot!  She was one of the holders of the three elven rings, marking her a peer of Gandalf's, and it was she that was tempted by the One Ring's power.<p>And then, in that other grand fantasy series, The Belgariad, there was of course Polgara, another strong female magic-using character, even though she ended up playing second fiddle to her father any time some direct application of power was required.<p>Overall, I can't help feeling that the speech was in response to Pratchett's own innate tendancy against female magic-users, as a close examination of most of the major series shows that many, if not most, had strong female magic-using characters, both good and evil.  At least Pratchett was able to see that he had a bias, and apparently fought against it to create Granny Weatherwax - full marks to the man :-)",1237184193

That's from housing to my car (the lease was cheaper out there, so I waited till I was situated to get one) to food (jack in the box value menu ftw). I'd suggest living with others, as the 1 bedrooms do seem to be higher priced to rent. Gas is never fun, but that's most of California.  Take the 22 or 522 bus.

You mean each variable will have the type LispObject (or PyObject or whatever)? Never happens, unless the C code is written by a deeply disturbed Lisp weenie (gcc and especially BetaPlayer, I’m talking about you). The fact that some people write C code as if they were a Lisp back-end is their personal problem, nothing more, nothing less.</i><p>No, that's obviously not what people who say that mean. Usually, they're talking about what I've most recently seen sold as an ""IoC frameworks"" like Java's Spring.<p>Meta-comment: He is awfully confident at ridiculing a claim he doesn't understand.

I saw a <i>lot</i> of camera test videos from photo forums, Android ROMs from Android forums, and PDFs of obscure pamphlets hosted on MegaUpload, because for quite some time it had a less painful captcha/wait process than RapidShare (and MediaFire wasn't popular yet).<p>I wouldn't use MegaUpload to share with my family but I certainly would use it to distribute the 200MB video file I wanted to share with a forum. Most ""file sync"" and ""personal sharing"" services try to actively prevent users from burning their bandwidth on one-to-many hosting, both as an anti-piracy measure and as a conscious business model decision. The ""share big files with lots of people"" niche is useful for people other than pirates, and now that niche is nigh-on impossible to fill in the US.",1327640267

They didn't just leave the US, they left everywhere that had high labor costs, and even now they are flowing to SE Asia out of China.

Because the people that would benefit from that approach (focusing on the user experience, etc.) are <i>not</i> the people that make the decisions about which system to buy. <i>Those</i> people could care less about what it looks like, or how usable it is.<p>That's the reason why so many EHRs have UIs that look like they belong up on blocks in somebody's front yard, and even worse-looking APIs- a misalignment of interests between the users of the system and the people who make the purchasing decisions.<p>It's like a little microcosm of everything that's wrong with the entire medical system... :-)",1327639835

They are a lot of middlemen moving hospitality products, most work on a commission structure and most receive an allotment that they can fill (it is supposed to be guaranteed, it never is in practice). These middlemen perform at different efficiencies. Most hospitality providers try to track their efficiency to effectively manage allotment, but there is no guarantee of their performance. Therefore, hospitality providers generally over allot to compensate for this, even if they used an online system that sells their product, they are not going to turn away other middlemen, who basically equal a zero up front cost sales channel.

He was immediately arrested by waiting members of the Long Beach Police Department.

3517123,comment,3513318,3515901,1,0,mturmon,,,"Thanks for your perspective.  It's interesting to connect anti-gentrification to NIMBYism.<p>I have come to believe that most anti-gentrification sentiment, at least where I live in LA, is misplaced.  It's a young city and to expect neighborhoods to stay the same on the time scale of decades is unrealistic.  There are laws (many mistaken, IMHO) to prevent property taxes from rising more than about 2% per year, so nobody will be forced from their home.  Renters may have to move, although there are rent protections on many properties also.<p>Anyway, anti-gentrification sentiment is interesting because it never stops.  People who moved to my neighborhood in 2000 think the 2010'ers are gentrifiers.  People who moved here in 1990 think it's the 2000'ers.  People who moved here in 1970 think it's anyone after 1980.<p>Most resentment and name-calling about ""gentrification"" is among the young, however.  By contrast, NIMBYism is more of a middle-age and old person's thing.  At least where I live.",1327637747

3517106,comment,3514176,3516469,1,0,tobiasSoftware,,,"It's not weird at all, at least to me.  I still love my solution for a crazy puzzle in Riven (Myst II).  You had to select certain stones with animals carved on them.  You figured out which ones to select by finding certain objects on the island, and the current screen supposedly contained a shape similar to the object. However it was nearly impossible to figure out which shapes corresponded to which stones partly because the puzzle was spread all over the game, and partly because it was hard to figure out which creature a shape represented.  My solution was to use my computer and programming knowledge.<p>Stage 1 was taking screenshots of the stones and shapes.  Stage 2 was outlining the shape screenshots with Paint, and using a simple script to look for the outline color, and other colors would change a background color, so I was left with a simple outline.  Stage 3 was using an image display program I created and will be selling soon to create a grid with the shape outlines in the top row and the stones with animals in the other rows. Thus I had all the information needed to figure out the code on a single screen.  This was so much more fun than doing it the normal way :)<p>Oh, and then there was the time I solved the last puzzle in Professor Layton, a sliding block puzzle, by programming it in.  I used brute force, which of course didn't work (too slow), but then used memoization techniques and such to speed it up.  I not only found a solution, but I found interesting stats, such as the minimum number of moves required.  It was even more interesting because it was my first program in Python, so I used it to learn the language.  Programming to solve video game puzzles is one of the most fun kinds of programming out there.",1327636856

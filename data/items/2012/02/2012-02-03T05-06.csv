3546004,comment,3545728,3545728,5,0,wickedchicken,,,"The author is failing to take into account the distribution of the applicants themselves. Discrimination can be interpreted many ways. In this scenario I prefer to word it as 'if you are in this class, you will have less of a chance to be accepted.' Thanks to Bayes' rule, we know that we can't ignore a priori probabilities - they are the only way to get a true probability without 'confidence intervals' and other junk. Classiscists avoid Bayes because the a priori distributions are often inconvenient or uncomputable. By measuring scores we can get a rough estimate of these probabilities and work with them. Thus, simply being born in a certain class dramatically alters your SAT scores <i>without you performing a single action</i>.<p>It's an unfortunate reality that race and gender based inequalities exist and affect real people. Attempting to build a 'meritocracy' without considering all factors creates a cycle that only exacerbates this effect. Chances are you think this way already and don't even know it: who in your opinion  works 'harder:' the poor immigrant who builds a business, or a trust fund child who builds a business of equal size? Both are equal on your 'meritocratic' measure but chances are you'd have a strong preference to choose one over the other to run your own business. This isn't some kind of charity, it's recognizing that this person applies a much larger multiplier to what they are given than other people. Therefore, giving them a 'proper' base to work on would have an even greater effect.",1328248731

I think US immigration policies could use a lot of improvement (using more polite expression here) and their implementation, including proneness of some personnel to power trips, could use a lot of improvement too. I myself crossed US border many times (not a citizen) and never had a bad experience, but I have read enough horror stories to conclude it happens much more often than it should have. And yes, nobody forces anybody to come to the US, and yes, it's totally within rights of the US to deny entry to any non-citizen and be as rude as they want while doing it. But that does not negate the facts expressed above, and I think US would significantly benefit if they fixed it. Saying ""don't like our border guards - stay the hell out"" won't benefit anybody.",1328248660

However, an article specifically quoting someone who used the term with its original meaning ought to know better, and either carefully distinguish or choose an alternate term.  I'd suggest that they almost certainly <i>did</i> know better, but intentionally exploited the ambiguity to push their agenda (namely, the pro-SOPA agenda).<p>That said, someone with as much PR experience as Mark Zuckerberg ought to have known better than to use the term in the first place.

1. Articles could be more interactive by providing discussion /commenting section.
2. Currently, if you want to see if the article you are checking out is worth reading you have to refer to the overall rating of the journal (this is known was impact factor). I think every article should have separate ratings. That way you can tell which are high impact articles and which are not. Btw the impact factors is calculated based on how many articles referred the article in hand. Does that sound familiar? It's the same concept as a webpage SEO. The more links pointing in the higher the rank.

My sister was turned away at the border because she had a one-way flight to visit her boyfriend and they figured she was going to visit illegally. She also had ""suspicious"" things in her suitcase like a cookbook: ""So you're going to take an illegal food service job?""<p>Make sure you can prove you have enough money to support yourself. The guy in line in front of me got sent back once because he couldn't prove this.<p>Avoid hard-to-explain travel arrangements, such as travelling in the US, crossing the border back into Canada to visit someone, then crossing back into the US to catch a plane. My best friend got stuck in Windsor because of this, although his scary hair and beard probably didn't help either.<p>If you have a green card, don't leave it at home by mistake. I got taken into the little room and had to pay a $265 administrative fee because of this.<p>Make sure you have documentation for everything. When my friends drove through the US to a wedding, I told them to make sure they had the invitation, hotel info, etc, to show customs so everything went smoothly.<p>Don't have a complex story that makes no sense. I'm sympathetic to the original author, but reading his post I couldn't figure out what he was really doing in the US and I'm not surprised he got turned away.<p>The strangest questioning I had crossing the border: ""Where are you visiting?"" ""What's your father's name?"" ""What does your father do?"" ""A teacher? What school did he teach at?"" By this point, I was wondering where this line of questioning was leading. But then the border guard said, ""I know your father. He taught me in Grade 11.""<p>While I'm on the subject of border crossing, I've opted out of TSA body scanning several times. I've seen complaints from others, but the patdown has always gone smoothly for me.",1328246191

There is no concept of a worker in .NET world.<p>Okie, you are saying that a worker is actually a process. Why not call it worker process? What happens if I have one worker and my application crashes due to unhandled exception? Do you automatically restart it? How long does it take to restart? What happens to other client requests while restart is taking place? As someone who has not used any PAAS in production environment, how do I decide how many workers do I need?

But if you notice, they let me run maximum of 10 apps on Silver cloud. So they decided that it only makes sense to run maximum of 10 apps if you have 613MB of memory. I think you should do something similar to educate people about PAAS. When I decided to try them out, the entire process to setup a running WordPress installation was seamless and took less than 5 minutes. I was so impressed that I immediately signed up for the silver cloud. At 30 bucks a month with 10 apps, a WordPress installation on a fully managed server costs me 3 bucks a month. It can't get cheaper than that. This month I am going to cancel my slicehost VPS because I frankly don't have any time/patience/expertise to manage my own server. Thank you very much.<p>For you guys, I would suggest that you should have some sample applications in your dashboard which user can install and play with (e.g. NerdDinner <a href=""http://nerddinner.codeplex.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nerddinner.codeplex.com/</a>). Let them get familiar to what your offering is before they decide to commit to your platform.<p>I am going to sign up for AppHarbor and see if it matches up my fantastic experience with phpfog and give you further feedback later on.",1328245803

That is, 3, 3.0, and 3/1 are purely notational differences, and all three represent exactly the same object.  Since math is theoretically infinite precision, the way you write a number has no impact on the way operations like division act on it, making whether it belongs to Z, or just Q or R a moot point.  Now, if you restrict your problem domain to Z, then that affects the operations you're able to do to a number and remain in that domain.  That's more like what happens with types in programming; we restrict our domain by default because leaving the integers changes the computer's representation of the number in a way that affects its behavior.",1328245408

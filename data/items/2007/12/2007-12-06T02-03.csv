Facebook is pretty much headed to an IPO and the IPO valuation will be far less than the Microsoft valuation. This will create a false sense of value driving the stock price up. <p>What's in it for Microsoft? I'm guessing Facebook is an important part of their online advertising plan, and they are going to get preferential treatment and power in excess of their share.<p>At least thats how it might play out, the root cause could still well be Zuckerberg's arrogance.",1196909974

86485,comment,86362,86465,0,0,mrtron,,,"I hate to be ""that guy""<p>~700$ cheaper?  For the base model, yes.  Make the specs comparable to the MBP:
2x2.2ghz, 2 gigs of ram, read/write drive, comparable battery: ~200 cheaper.
They still dont exactly match, the MBP now has a better vidcard still, and the Sony has 1280x800 resolution instead of 1440x900.<p>Apple hardware is very comparable in price to most other providers.",1196909127

Unless you have a fairly good reason to go with Linux (Ubuntu in your case), I don't see the motivation to do it.  However, if I was getting a Dell, I would instantly go Linux for obvious reasons - I need to be running my dev stack on my local machine, remotely connecting won't cut it.",1196908432

I agree that in a climate where Sony's response to the rootkit thing is normal, any humility goes a long way.  This post is mostly sincere and mostly apologetic, but Zuckerberg needs a better editor.  It could be streamlined a lot.  He'd lost my attention by the second use of the word 'lightweight,' and I knew exactly what he meant.",1196907257

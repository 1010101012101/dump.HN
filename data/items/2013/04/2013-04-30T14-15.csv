If consciousness is a sort of information sheaf attached to spacetime that ""measures"" (in some yet-to-be-determined mathematically precise way) certains canonical kinds of information flow (e.g., recursion, self-reference, entwined causality) over all possible sets in the topology, then the Chinese room would be isomorphic to the mind. One also has to consider its interactions with the external environment. What if everything else in the universe was ""Chinese-roomized"" so that time and space scale appropriately? That's the same consciousness sheaf on the same space doing the same computations, and there is little reason to believe the algorithm would feel any different from the inside.",1367333980

5632431,comment,5631256,5632316,3,0,new299,,,"I actually think that Searle's Chinese room experiment neatly defines the divide between the mind from matter and dualism groups. The dualists believe that the Chinese room can not be squared with their notion of consciousness, the qualia, which is largely based on their subjective experience of consciousness. The Mind from Matter people essentially think that the subjective experience is an illusion, that there is no qualia. That's the fundamental divide, and the Chinese room experiment is useful in that it neatly divides those two groups.<p>I personally don't buy the ""if it's indistinguishable from a person it's conscious"" argument. Philosophical Zombies for example are a good example of system that I think could appear conscious, but I don't think are in any meaningful way. That is to say, if you had a large lookup table of every possible response, or just ""guessed"" reasonable responses by chance, I don't think that says anything meaningful about consciousness.<p>The above might be solved by putting somekind of information content limit on this system, for example if a system responds as a human, and it's construction requires as little or less information than a human then it can be said to be conscious, but basing your judgement purely on response is not enough in my view.<p>In general I find philosophers rather annoying when they try and deal with consciousness, Searle is at least easier to pin down and does attempt to interact with the AI community to some degree.",1367333049

If you've got live grid to connect to and sync to, why would you ever black start anyway?  Or more precisely that has nothing to do with the ""fun"" of black starting.<p>The actual EE-ish problem with black starts is that darn control systems class the EEs have to sit thru full of bode stability plots and stuff.<p>The problem is that power plants and the innards are kind of like highly tuned race car engines.  The peak of technological performance at 1000 horsepower out, but at idle they get kinda squirrelly and don't really know what to do so as not to oscillate and/or stall and/or blow themselves up.  For the signal/telecom EE types, black start is kind of like having a very high power finicky high gain amplifier with no decent termination and no real input and not much control, the odds of that dude deciding to oscillate are unfortunately high.  Another way to put it is ""the grid"" is more or less predictable constant impedance you can smoothly and predictably match to, but connected to nothing during a black start or initial power up is very much like keying a high power radio transmitter when not connected to an antenna or dummy load, its going to be pretty impressive no matter if it blows up or not.<p>Theres some interesting impedance issues.  An alternator is kinda like a constant current source, for a given field winding current it'll squirt out a much higher current from the main windings.  And inductors don't like to change their current flow.  And the only limit to the voltage is arc over and/or the internal resistance of the winding (well.. AC is much more complicated, but..)  So overexcite the field winding on a connected gen and the voltage across town goes up a hundredth of a volt who cares.  Overexcite a unconnected / black start gen and it could just arc over and explode or blow transformers and just F the place all up in general.  Dump an extra megawatt-hour of energy in the general direction of Chicago and Chicago doesn't sniffle, dump it into one little piece of switchgear in the yard all by itself because its disconnected / blackstarting and the arc blows it to pieces.<p>Another issue not at his relatively boring gas turbine plant is stuff like differential thermal expansion.  You have to heat and cool boilers and steam turbos slowly or else differential expansion can rip them apart.  Supposedly if you leak even a little steam on a stationary turbine it'll expand one side enough while leaving the other side unexpanded and cold that when you slam the valve open its an open guess if you'll destroy the bearings from vibration or smash the blades into the outside of the turbine.  So you keep them spinning, even if its really slow like 10 RPM, all the time, forever, unless you've got a crane on site to replace.  And boilers blow up if you heat them too quickly, same problem with parts at different temps.<p>Gas turbos are tougher than steam turbos for a variety of reasons one being they're so dang hot and so much outside air (full of bugs and stuff) flows thru them that they can't build to the tolerances that a steam turbo can use, so they don't even try, so powering one up isn't as exciting as you'd think.  Oh its loud, but not as exciting as spinning up a steamie.<p>Another fun feature is black starting is pretty hard on your whole backup system.  Idling the diesel for 15 minutes a week is not quite as exciting as slamming it open full throttle for 12 hours while you heat up the main boiler or whatever.  So if you're going to blow up your UPS / diesel / whatever its going to happen at black start time.<p>There's a general engineering rule that its a heck of a lot easier to design something that constantly does the same thing than something that varies, maybe randomly.",1367332763

It's an unprecedented discovery,"" said Jorge Zavala, an archaeologist at Mexico's National Anthropology and History Institute.<p>The Mesoamerican ruins of Teotihuacan, a World Heritage Site, represent one of the largest urban centers of the ancient world. Thought to have been established around 100 B.C., the pyramid-filled city had more than 100,000 inhabitants at its peak, but was abandoned for mysterious reasons around 700 A.D. -- long before the Aztecs arrived in the 1300s.<p>The excavation at the temple focused on a 330-foot-long tunnel which runs under the structure. The conduit was discovered in 2003 when heavy rain uncovered a hole a few feet from the pyramid.<p>Exploring the tunnel, which was deliberately filled with debris and ruins by the Teotihuacan people, required several years of preliminary work and planning.<p>""Finally, a few months ago we found two side chambers at 72 and 74 meters (236 and 242 feet) from the entrance. We called them North Chamber and South Chamber, archaeologist Sergio Gmez Chvez, director of the Tlalocan Project, told Discovery News.<p>The archaeologists explored the tunnel with a remote-controlled robot called Tlaloc II-TC, which has an infrared camera and a laser scanner that generates 3D visualization of the spaces beneath the temple.<p>""The robot was able to enter in the part of the tunnel which has not yet been excavated yet and found three chambers between 100 and 110 meters (328 and 360 feet) from the entrance,"" Gmez Chvez said.<p>The mysterious spheres lay in both the north and south chambers. Ranging from 1.5 to 5 inches, the objects have a core of clay and are covered with a yellow material called jarosite.<p>""This material is formed by the oxidation of pyrite, which is a metallic ore,"" Gmez Chvez said. ""It means that in pre-hispanic times they appeared as if they were metallic spheres. There are hundreds of these in the south chamber.""<p>According to George Cowgill, professor emeritus at Arizona State University and the author of several publications on Teotihuacan, the spheres are a fascinating find.<p>""Pyrite was certainly used by the Teotihuacanos and other ancient Mesoamerican societies,"" Cowgill told Discovery News. ""Originally the spheres would have shown brilliantly. They are indeed unique, but I have no idea what they mean.""<p>Even the walls and ceiling of both chambers were covered with a mineral powder composed of magnetite, pyrite and hematite which provided a special brightness to the place.<p>""We believe that high-ranking people, priests or even rulers, went down to the tunnel to perform rituals,"" Gmez Chvez said.<p>Indeed the archaeologists found many offerings, including pottery and wooden masks covered with inlaid rock crystal, jade and quartz -- all dating from around 100 A.D.<p>Gmez Chvez and his team now look forward to the next phase of the project -- exploring the last part of the tunnel and three chambers which archaeologists have seen through the robot cameras.<p>""The tunnel is in pristine condition, untouched for almost two millennia,"" said Ng TC Tze Chuen, an independent researcher who worked on the design of the Tlloc II-TC robot. ""Can you can imagine what can be found inside?""<p>Ng, who helped create the Djedi robot that explored Egypt's Great Pyramid in 2010, believes the Mexican tunnel might lead to one of the most significant archaeological finds in Teotihuacan.<p>""The results are very encouraging indeed,"" he said.<p>According to Gmez Chvez, the tunnel was sealed twice by the Teotihuacan people. Thick walls, erected to block access, were demolished about 1,800 years ago in order to deposit something very important in the central chamber at the end of the tunnel.<p>""Maybe in this place,"" Gmez Chvez said, ""we will find the remains of those who ruled Teotihuacan.",1367332376

The example is contrived.<p>Rebase is necessary so everyone develops based on the same version of upstream.<p>The example is contrived because it does not take into consideration that you will get merge commits for every developer updating his local mirror of the repository, causing the disorder to happen in blocks, worse than with rebase. With 3 or more developers committing to the same repo, the resulting history is impossible to read.<p>Bisect will let you go back one merge commit at a time on the branch you're bisecting (in this case, master), which will be filled with merge commits. You will be able to detect which merge contains the offending commit, but not the commit itself. 
Then what? You revert the merge commit? You loose all the good commits along with the offending commit. Then, you need the original branch to make the fix, and then a new merge.<p>Who gets to commit into master, and who doesn't? If the answer is ""nobody"" then you will have master filled with merge commits.<p>If having the commits in chronological order was important, git would order them by timestamp instead of hash.

Indeed, Stalin instituted extreme gun restrictions, and then proceeded to terrorize the people of course. About the only thing you could get away with in Stalinist Russia was a hunting rifle in rural areas. Even when the Communists first took over Russia, they quickly passed laws as part of the criminal code stipulating that unauthorized ownership of a gun would result in hard labor, so they moved to strictly control all ownership by dictate and fear.<p>Hitler's Nazi party initially attempted gun restrictions by performing house to house searches of their opponents to confiscate guns. The Weimar Government before him had already previously ordered the surrender of all firearms. All the Nazis had to do was selectively enforce the Weimar Government's already strict gun laws. But that wasn't enough, so in March 1938 the Nazis wrote their own strict gun control laws.<p>But let's just read from history on how it worked in practice...<p>""On November 9, 1938 and into the next morning, the Nazis unleashed a nationwide race riot. Mobs inspired by the government attacked Jews in their homes, looted Jewish businesses, and burned synagogues, with no interference from the police. The riot became known as ""Kristallnacht"" (""night of broken glass""). On November 11, Hitler issued a decree forbidding Jews to possess firearms, knives, or truncheons under any circumstances, and to surrender them immediately.""<p>It's obviously not that the fascists needed to disarm everybody, just their opponents. That's a critical point.<p>One of the things the Nazis of Germany and the Communists of Russia have in common, is they immediately looked to control guns, so as to restrict opposition. It's common sense that that is exactly what a violent regime would do.",1367331827

The fact is even if you are doing it ""right"" with strict topic branches you still can get very hairy unbisectable conflicts that would be easier to reason about with a rebased history.  Let's look at specific statements:<p>> <i>In our simple one-off examples above, this is no big deal. If you've got an entire history that's been heavily-rebased and your problem is ""This bug started happening on Tuesday last week"", you have a big problem: You can't just track back through your simple, linear branch until you get to last Tuesday's commits. You have to keep going back until you're absolutely certain there are no other commits further back in the history that are newer chronologically.</i><p>This has literally never come up for me in 5 years of using git because if you are looking at bugs that were introduced at a certain point of time you aren't looking at commit timestamps anyway.  The important thing was when was the commit deployed (in the case of production bugs) or pulled (in the case of development bugs).<p>> <i>The whole reason to use a VCS is to have it record your history. Rebasing destroys your history, and therefore destroys the point of using a VCS.</i><p>That is a complete non-sequitur.  Rebasing doesn't destroy history, it rewrites it.  It's no different from accepting a patch via email.  Or writing down a ticket that your going to make x change then y change then z change.  The fact is VCS is a tool.  Git gives you incredible power to curate history, and understanding of how to use this power in the here and now can make for a more understandable future.  Rebasing is potentially just an extension of not breaking the build by committing half a feature.<p>> <i>The ""simple linear history"" is a lie. The branched history might not be as pretty, but it's an accurate representation of what happened.</i><p>A linear history has real mathematical benefits that I wrote about at <a href=""http://darwinweb.net/articles/the-case-for-git-rebase"" rel=""nofollow"">http://darwinweb.net/articles/the-case-for-git-rebase</a>.  In practice I've done things both with a topic-branch orientation and a rebase-to-master orientation, and I understand both intimately, and a rebased linear history does not destroy nearly as much information as this article would have you believe.  You can still see when a commit was written in addition to when it was rebased which provides most of the value of seeing the whole branch structure (which incidentally is not a magic oracle into the developer's mindset eitherthere is always out-of-band information).<p>The idea that the git tree be immediately frozen and never-changing after every single commit is an unnecesarily rigid perspective.  It works perfectly well in practice to imagine rebasing as the developer having implemented their topic branch instantaneously based on the current state, and resolving conflicts on a commit-by-commit basis rather than accumulating them into one opaque merge commit.<p>> <i>It's so tempting to stay on master, to think ""It's just a quick fix, it's not worth branching for!""</i><p>You can have your cake and eat it too.  Just do `git branch new_topic; git reset --hard origin/master`.  There's no reason to branch prematurely because there's nothing to stop you from branching any time.  This is the thing about <i>distributed</i> version control, and git in particular, you do whatever makes sense locally and you don't need to care at all what anyone else is doing until you fetch.<p>> <i>Because if you keep your work on the main branch and you frequently commit bad code, then the day will come when you hit the absolute no-no of rebasing: You'll push a bad commit to a remote, and then you'll be stuck because you absolutely must not rebase published history.</i><p>In that case you simply push your fix.  Why does a rebase-based workflow lead this to be a catastrophe?  It doesn't matter what workflow you are using, you will push a bug eventually, then you will fix it.<p>> <i>The best thing that could happen to rebase is that it gets relegated to ""power tool that you don't find out about until you're a git wizard"" because far too many people use it as a crutch to support their ability to use git without understanding it.</i><p>I'll agree here, you shouldn't use rebase if you don't know what you're doing with git.  New users should definitely be forced to work entirely with merge and possibly --no-ff to get the basics of how git works.  Rebasing is a power user feature, but it's not difficult to understand if you understand git fundamentals.  That is if you understand commits and trees and branches, if you don't then it's way too sharp a tool.<p>> <i>If you use rebase more than once a week, I maintain that you have a problem. It might be hard to spot, it might be rough on your ego, but that's my opinion.</i><p>Rebasing is just a tool.  Maybe someone likes to commit every file and then curate with rebase -i, who are you to tell them their doing it wrong?  You certainly haven't demonstrated that with a bunch of strawman arguments about committing buggy code or that direct collaboration on a feature should axiomatically happen via pairing vs any other method.  All of this is just a distraction to the core questions: what are the pros and cons of rebasing?  What history is destroyed by rebasing?  What are the advantages of branched history vs linear history?",1367331031

Rebase, as the name suggests, simply rebase the starting point of your local history. It preserves your history better than that merge commit and having your series of commits intertwined with commits from other people implementing features not related to yours.<p>Rebasing also makes merging even easier, because now merging is done on a commit by commit granularity rather than branches. This also preserves the history better.<p>It's funny that the main rational for most people to use rebase is that it provides better history and this article is arguing that it does the exact opposite without carefully comparing the history in both scenarios. His only argument is that it's not ""Real"", but what we really care about is ""clear"" history, not necessarily whose commits come first.",1367330499

Whenever I make a mistake in a commit (be it a typo, a small bug or perhaps I went in wrong direction and backtracked later on) I either <i>--amend</i> it, or, if it's an earlier commit, <i>git rebase --interactive</i> to fix it.<p>In other words, ask yourself, ``Would this commit stand for a good LKML submission?'' Until it does, it's <i>--amend</i> or <i>git rebase --interactive</i> time. Refactor history just as you refactor code ;-)<p>Of course, once the code is pushed to a shared repo, the genie is out of the bottle and there's no changing it. But that's a different matter.<p>What you want to do is:<p><pre><code>  * 1) clean up history with git-pull --rebase, git-rebase --interactive and git commit --amend, 
  * 2) then optionally perform git merge --no-ff --log --edit  $your_feature_branch while on $upstream_tracking_branch, to create a new, merge-ish commit that covers the whole new feature you've been working on.
</code></pre>
This way you have:<p><pre><code>  * clean history
  * logical, standalone commits
  * complex features introduced by a separate merge-ish commit (which you can git-rollback as whole, if need be).

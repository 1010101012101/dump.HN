After a few months(!) of introduction and systems learning, he was tasked with writing a small portion of code.  I don't remember the specifics, but it was a very specific task (e.g., ""write code to display the fuel level in liters.)<p>After a day or so, he turned in his code (something like 30 lines) and was chastised for having done too much.  ""What are you trying to kill people?!?""<p>Turns out the regular output of their developers was something like 5-10 lines of code per day, and only certain days of the week.  Finished products were peer reviewed before being QAd.<p>At the time, I was just learning early Ruby, and getting used to the concepts of rapid development, and it seemed so strange.

It doesn't exist for its own sake, and it certainly has no need to be a mathematically correct, long-term sustainable, rigorous system designed by a computer scientist.<p>The capitalist system, with all its problems, is the best system that we have. Who cares that it's not sustainable indefinitely into the future? By the time we get there, things may well have changed so drastically that it becomes completely irrelevant.<p>A human being is not a sustainable thing either. It overspends its resources instead of maintaining itself in good working condition and eventually dies. Oh shit. We better cancel humanity.

Early on, when the U.S. military was reluctant to allow civilians full access to cryptographic technology, there were still laws on the books limiting consumer e-mail clients and the like to 40-bit encryption.  When Moore's Law eventually made this kind of barrier breakable in milliseconds, the laws were changed to allow 128-bit encryption to be ""exported.""  Nowadays, there's no real limit due to most crypto research being driven overseas, although I don't remember if the arbitrary key size limit was finally removed in the U.S. proper.",1231252709
421950,comment,421373,421434,0,0,ssharp,,,"So what is the answer to this problem?<p>The GRE is a pretty generalized test.  Most undergrad programs use either the generic SAT or ACT as their test factor - it's a efficient and useful way to measure a large group of people.  The most important prerequisite for most graduate programs is an undergraduate degree in that field.  How you performed (as well as the quality of the program you graduated from) is likely the most useful tool, so I can see how the GRE would be downplayed.<p>In some graduate programs, specifically law and business, what field your undergraduate degree is in isn't that important.  I'm guessing this is why the LSAT and GMAT tend to weigh more in admission decisions than the GRE does.",1231252702

Every time someone did better than me I thought ""well, they didn't stay up every night of this week doing drugs"" or ""if I studied I would have done way better"" or ""I coded a one month assignment in 3 days, so what if I didn't do the extra credit"". I managed to still be pretty successful, but now find myself frustrated with the easy choices I made.<p>It wasn't until I grew up that I realized the value of success and failure (and the necessity of failure in big successes). Unfortunately, now I'm a bit older and some of the benefits of youth are gone, making it tougher to take huge risks, but I am doing it anyway, because I'm so resentful of all the self-handicapping I did throughout my youth.<p>It's a big part of why I decided to join a startup and leave a cushy big company job (that was actually pretty fun some of the time) - in a startup, you might just fail even if you do a great job, but you're sure to learn a ton. No startup exists without feeling like it's going to die at some point, and I felt like I couldn't push through this self-handicapping without experiencing near failure and pushing through it.",1231252522

CO2 emissions, rainforests, overpopulation, etc.  But this Earth is wonderfully well-stocked with potential sources of energy and other resources.

421946,comment,420450,420608,0,0,iamelgringo,,,"I disagree.  While I am certainly sad personally that Steve Jobs is not doing well health-wise, I think that his behavior is directly responsible for the uproar about his health.<p>From any number of articles that I have read, Steve has set up his company to be centered around him.  As CEO, he gets involved in minute decisions regarding the design or function of a product.  I've seen his management style described as ""controlling"" or ""micromanageing"" a number of times.  He has created a public persona of the hipster CEO dressed in black who presents every year to throngs of amazed people, ""Oh, and one more thing..."".<p>So, when he creates himself to be a single point of failure, his health becomes a big news.  He should have figured this out 4 years ago when he was trying to cure his cancer homeopathically, and his board of directors had an intervention with him to get him to go to the doctor.<p>Media companies have a similar systems when they work with stars.  When the success of a multimillion dollar organization depends heavily a single person's performance or health, you better believe that that person's health has a very large insurance policy.  And, there's a lot of tabloid interest in that person's health.  Just ask Oprah.",1231252230

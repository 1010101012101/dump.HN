And yet I'm going to offer this old quote from the Car Talk guys:<p>""In the immortal words of former GM president Roger Smith, when asked by John White, who works for the <i>Boston Globe</i>, what kind of car can an American buy if he wants to buy an American car for under ten grand and if he wants to buy a General Motors car? And Roger Smith thought for a second and said, 'A two-year-old Buick.'""<p>So perhaps the used Mac market would be helpful. I'd be a little bit worried about reliability -- the warranty repair rate on Macs seems a bit higher as Apple and the rest of the  PC world continue to push product costs into the nether regions -- but, hey, what do you want for $400?<p>Of course, used Macs hold their prices pretty well, so your statement may be accurate.",1204303953
126160,comment,124553,125507,0,0,KirinDave,,,"What github offers is community and project maintenance around git. This is not something git gives you on its own, nor is it trivial to simulate with free tools. I've recently put a project up and had people who follow me ask about the project and offer code, just because I put it up. They're building a focused, targeted community with opt-in listens (like twitter's very successful model) for code. It's a fantastic idea.<p>Running github is not free, and writing it has been an uncompensated investment for its maintainers. I am sure they hope to make at least enough money to pay for the bandwidth and hardware. It's doubtful people will begrudge them that.",1204303949

126149,comment,125950,126022,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"I'll always remember my first encounter with employee stock options at a startup company. (Not to be confused with startup founder equity, which consists of actual shares of the company, and enough of them that you're actually playing the game instead of watching from the bleachers. And also not to be confused with employee options at a big Fortune 1000 company, which have a fairly predictable value -- if you're smart enough to exercise them ASAP and sell the stock, instead of pulling an Enron and leaving all your eggs in one basket.)<p>ME: ""I see I'm being offered 10,000 options. What does that number ""10,000"" mean? What units is it in? What is 1 option worth?""<p>STARTUP GUY: ""It depends on how many shares are outstanding, and what the share price is.""<p>ME: ""Well, how many shares are outstanding?""<p>GUY: ""Right now there are, um, something like X shares. I don't really remember. But it doesn't really matter to you at this point, because we can always issue more.""<p>ME: ""Um, okay. And if you go public, my options can be converted to shares, which will be worth whatever people pay for them... but we have no idea what that will be, because it's in the indeterminate future, and right now this company consists entirely of debts and handwaving.""<p>GUY: ""Right.""<p>ME: ""What if you sell the company before we go public? Then our company's stock never formally trades on a market, so I have options to buy something that is never going to exist. How do the options get evaluated then?""<p>GUY: ""Well, the board has to decide how to compensate the existing option holders.""<p>ME: ""Hmm. And they can decide to pretend that my options are worth... whatever? Down to and including zero?""<p>GUY: ""Um, yeah. Technically. They'd probably try to make you guys happy.""<p>At which point I decided to never, ever think about employee stock options again. Just pretend they are like those Certificates of Achievement that managers give you when you've worked a lot of overtime -- don't throw them away, but stick them in a file somewhere and forget about them. And, as it happens, that worked out just fine.",1204302481

So there's a lag between when you change something (e.g. the exposure) and when you can see the result.<p>Picnik appears to be doing it in client-side Actionscript. The real-time rendering (image changes as you drag the slider) makes it much more usable for photo-editing. I can actually use an online photo-editing app now!",1204302365

HTTP<p>2. How to add query parameters to a URL<p>3. How to write an Ant script (they rely on Eclipse's compilation)<p>4. How to configure and deploy a .war file by hand (they export a .war file using Eclipse and run it in an embedded tomcat instance)<p>5. Why using System.out.println() in a servlet won't show anything in the server logs.<p>...<p>The list goes on and on.  The worst thing about Java is that it is deliberately dumbed-down so that enterprises can easily make their programmers replaceable.

Most dev cycles are based on milestones that have a quantified completion point, and that's when things are ""done"". Otherwise we'd never get anything ""done"". We change the language. ;)<p>It's just that every basket of tasks that compose a Milestone (bug fixes, UI enhancements, etc) has a statistical break down of things that tend to be really easy --> really hard. Being that a certain % of tasks on average will be really hard (say ~10%), you end up spending ~90% of your time on those ~10% of tasks. So even when you quantify things down to a completion point, you still see this (perceptionally) diminishing return on labor invested phenomenon.",1204301372

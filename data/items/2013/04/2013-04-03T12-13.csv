5485717,comment,5484558,5484830,4,0,mfenniak,,,"I think the advice in point #1 only makes sense with a caveat: When performance is an issue, if you can calculate or process it at the application layer _without adding load to the database layer_, then take it out of the database layer.<p>For example, order-by w/ limit/offset?  If you do that at the application layer, you've increased the I/O usage on the database server, and clearly this advice doesn't make sense.<p>On the other hand, group-by (assuming no HAVING)?  If you do that at the application layer, you've reduced the load on the database server, increased the load on the network, and you've probably made a justifiable performance vs. scalability trade-off.  If you measure it and back it up with data.<p>I think the advice here in the article is too broad, but I can see a kernel of wisdom in it that is non-intuitive.",1364993978

One thing that's hard to communicate with those who've decided to pass up on higher education is how many different (and different kinds) of tools it gives you in your field.<p>It's not just the theoretical bits, or the formalism, but also the <i>language</i> of the field...something which has a surprising number of uses beyond just talking to a peer. A decade after my undergrad, I'll be working on a problem and remember a handful of possible algorithms from my undergrad days that might apply to it, but have no clue about the particulars (they may have not even been covered). But because I learned the <i>language</i> of the subject, I can usually drive into google for an hour or so and quickly triage the algorithms to find the one I want to relearn. It's easy to look things up when you know what they are called -- and more importantly can understand the instructions!<p>I have a number of friends who decided to focus purely on their development skills and skip school, and they've definitely expressed frustration at finding and understanding the literature, or have spent many hours reinventing the wheel because they didn't realize it had already been built!",1364993745

5485692,comment,5485236,5485489,70,0,polyfractal,,,"Hmm...except that cryopreservation is still, as of this point, a complete crock of shit. Trying to find a necromancer would be more productive.<p>As an ex-biologist, I can assure you that horrible cellular damage is being committed to these ""preserved"" people.  I used to flash-freeze all sorts of cells, ranging from bacteria (e. coli) to animal (IMCD3 and MDCK kidney) to human (Human Embryonic Kidney, Primary cortical and hippocampal neurons).<p>These protocols are pretty simple.  Pellet and re-suspend a small vial of cells to dilute out the media, replace with a special preservation media then dunk the entire 5mL vial in a big pot of liquid nitrogen for a few minutes.  Then it goes into the deep freezer (-80C).<p>Sadly, even though this is a tiny aliquot that is frozen almost instantly, cell death on thawing and resuspension is immense.  Like, it's a good day if 50% of the cells live.  It usually doesn't matter, since these cell lines are immortalized and they just start growing again, but it illustrates the point.  Despite the most ideal circumstances, cells hate to be frozen.<p>Now, imagine you are trying to flash freeze an entire body.  They do this by perfusing preservation media through your blood, relying on your body's circulatory system to get the media in all the right places.  This takes time.  Perfusing a small mouse with formaldehyde takes at least 5-10 minutes.  A human body?  Practically ages I would guess.<p>All the while, cells are dieing left and right because they are no longer getting a steady supply of oxygen (and instead a bath of relatively cytotoxic preservation media).  When the body is finally perfused fully and dunked into liquid nitrogen...flash freezing isn't immediate.  The outer layers freeze much faster than the inner layers.<p>Ok, so just freeze the brain?  Same problem as before, just on a slightly smaller scale.<p>Ignoring all the cell death that has been happening for the last hour, how about thawing?  Well, let's pretend its a ""good day"" and 50% of your cells live.  That might be ok for your skin, liver, or spleen - they are going to be unhappy but still alive.  But 50% of your neurons dieing?  Hmm.  Also take into account that neurons don't regenerate.  You just killed half your brain.  Even super optimistic numbers, 70%-80% survival rate, still leave a lot of your brain as goo.<p>This is all just biology.  I'm not even touching the morals and ethics of companies that are under no obligation to actually do what you paid them to do (since you are dead).",1364993636

Please take a look if you're familiar with this area of Django.""<p>That added nothing new, because anyone who would review it has already been informed. That's what the reply told you. They have no idea who you are, or what you know about the process, or even that you want to follow the process.<p>You then followed up with ""How else am I supposed to find someone to review my patch? I got no response on IRC."" That does give the sense that you're exasperated. That doesn't help them understand that you want to work with them.<p>Also, your first email has the wrong tone, in several ways.<p>You wrote that you ""need a reviewer to mark the ticket as RFC"". That is a presumptive view, because it assumes that a reviewer will mark the ticket as RFC. The reviewer might say that it needs many changes, and pass it back to you for continued development.<p>Second, the line ""Please take a look if you're familiar with this area of Django."" is not helpful to the person reading the email. How does someone know if they are familiar with that area without actually going to the bug? They have to take a look. Which means that anyone who might review it will have to take a look, no matter if they are familiar with it or not.<p>My belief is that if you had asked a question about the process, rather than the patch, and explained how you were trying to work within the existing process, then you would have gotten a more useful answer. For example:<p>""I've just contributed my first patch to Trac. Now I'm waiting for a reviewer. I asked for one on IRC but got no answer after several hours. The contribute FAQ suggests asking here as well. Can someone here review <url> for me?""<p>That's gentler than the email you first sent. It would have probably gotten an answer like what the FAQ says:<p>Remember, ""its not personal. Django is entirely developed by volunteers (even the core devs), and sometimes folks just dont have time.""<p>Instead of developing a patch, what about reviewing the patches that others have submitted?

5485647,comment,5480183,5485396,2,0,icebraining,,,"> The point of declarative programming is to declare what you want done. The runtime may turn it into greatness or crap, that's not really relevant.<p>I didn't say the quality of the runtime was relevant. The point is that the runtime is free to achieve the goal you give it in any way it feels fit. In Python, the runtime isn't; it needs to ensure specific runtime guarantees.<p>>> In your example, if you replace max() with a function that prints something, you'll see it's executed for each value in 'table', which is extremely inefficient.<p>> It's also not relevant and an implementation detail, with a known max() on a known type the implementation would be free to lift the computation out since this expression doesn't have side-effects.<p>No, it can't. The Python reference specifies the semantics of generator expressions, and it says ""Only the outermost for-expression is evaluated immediately, the other expressions are deferred until the generator is run""[1].<p>A implementation that lifted the computation would not be implementing Python, but a derivative language.<p>Furthermore, your example didn't specify neither the type of neither 'table' nor 'max', so I still think it's deceptive.<p>> The runtime can know that all types and functions involved are their native side-effect-less versions and is free to optimize them if it wishes, that it does not is irrelevant.<p>See above. According to the language spec, it can't.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0289/#the-details"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0289/#the-details</a>",1364992994

Think of this reporter [0].<p>However, I'm sure he's an intelligent men, and I'm sure when speaking informally he'll fall back to AAVE. What I'd love to see is someone at, say, PhD Math or Physics level speaking in AAVE, preferably about that subject.<p>I'm studying a bit of Arabic, and I see parallels. In Arabic, there's the formal register, called Modern Standard Arabic. This is the dialect used in the Quran and printed in newspapers and such. However, people don't routinely speak in this register -- they speak in their local Gulf or Levantine or Egyptian dialects, which are pretty different from each other and from MSA. The pronunciation of letters is different, the vocabulary is different, hell, in Egyptian the question word goes at the end of the sentence whereas in other dialects it goes at the beginning.<p>They, too, think of their local dialects as ""wrong"" or ""beneath"" MSA, even though it's the native tongue of themselves and everyone around them, and they have to study for years to be comfortable with this somewhat artificial MSA dialect.<p>It's not quite as regimented in English, because the dialects are more similar, and because no one natively speaks the formal register, but the principles are the same.<p>[0] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ti1dHabjH3k"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ti1dHabjH3k</a>

For instance, if you're sending a constant stream of position updates, you don't need them all to be reliable. E.g. just send the last N frames of updates in each unreliable datagram. That way if one is missed, you can just interpolate / extrapolate. Triggering particle effects or other non-critical eye-candy can also be unreliable.<p>Check out RakNet. It's a really solid C++ networking library optimized for games and similar soft-realtime use cases. Internally, this is what Unity's built-in networking is implemented with. Since I couldn't access Unity's RakNet directly, I wrapped the DLL for access from my own client-side
Unity code. I used custom Python on the back-end.<p>Another option to consider is SmartFox Server. It does things like lobbies, IP block ranges, and sessions management.<p>Chances are you'll end up re-implementing a lot of functionality that they've written already. I was okay with that, because I wanted to learn how.<p>Hope this helps.<p>You should decouple your network polling from the game update loop to avoid headaches later. I.e. don't do it in Update.

I got in on the deal and unfortunately ended up paying well over 50% the cost of the knife in various transfer fees.  So my ""$25 knife"" or whatever it was ended up costing me about $50.  First I needed to convert from dollars to euros, then an international xfer, then into something kinda like a cross between what americans would call paypal and a checking account I believe it was the iban system where I basically sent money to a number almost exactly like paypal would send money to an email addrs.  Nobody would do stuff like this unless they were desperate or crazy or just didn't care so the financial cartels tacked on incredible fees at each step.  Oh if only we could have made a transaction with BTC.  It takes about 5 minutes to make a BTC transaction so the currency risk is pretty minimal compared to the 50%+ fees from traditional currency changers.  Given those numbers, even during an active crash its safer/cheaper to use BTC than traditional forms of transfer.<p>Anyway the value of a bitcoin solely due to transfers is (how much money the world is transferring across borders with BTC today) / (how many BTC are available for that kind of transfer/trading today) with a correction factor for velocity of money today.  So if a billion bucks a day flows outta $dying_country and there's ten thousand BTC in the trading pool being used to transfer the money, and the velocity of money is the btc change hands a thousand times a day, then the price delta due to Cyprus/whatever would therefore be ""about"" $100 per individual BTC on top of whatever existing value due to other transfers and such.  These numbers are pretty well made up but this is generally where very long term price estimates end up.  So assuming BTC someday approaches 1% of paypals volume, then given paypals well known transfer volume stats, and some realistic estimates of the BTC trading pool size, the price per BTC would be...<p>Much like EE work this valuation benefits from a hydrologic comparison.

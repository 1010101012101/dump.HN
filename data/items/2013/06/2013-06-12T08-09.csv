5867177,comment,5867003,5867003,8,0,gonvaled,,,"&quot;First, its not clear to us that other governments have any less intrusive surveillance activities.&quot;<p>Well, it is clear the US has it. That should be enough. There are some unknowns unknowns, but this is a known unknown. There are other governments with the same willingness and capabilities of spying on everyone (do not move to China), but most of the countries in the world do not have a Government with both willingness and the technical abilities to do it. And most of the countries do not have a <i>huge</i> and highly sophisticated shadow-government, with multiple agencies working out of the public oversight. Most countries have secret services, but they are a joke compared to what the US is able to deliver.<p>&quot;Second, as a US company, Mozilla is subject to US Laws, wherever we host our servers.&quot;<p>Move the company out of the US. I undertsand that it won&#x27;t be easy, but is the only way to be 100% sure that the US Government will not come requesting data (not that they will not take it anyway, if they are able to)<p>&quot;Third, wed rather not engage in an arms-race with US government agencies.&quot;<p>Read: we are afraid to lead here, because backlash from the government (and the public?) could be too damaging for Mozilla.<p>&quot;Wed rather focus on efforts to change the Law to respect user data wherever it lives.&quot;<p>We know so much: the privacy situation in the US is bad, and getting worse <i>very</i> fast. No amount of public discussion or legislation is going to change that. If PRISM is outlawed, even if those responsible are put into prison, they will start the PROSM program, more secretive, more broad. We will know about it on 2037 (maybe not, since by then we will be already living in a fully accomplished Orwell world). By then Mozilla will issue a statement similar to this one, explaining why they are not really taking the necessary steps.<p>Fazit: if even a company committed to freedom and openness like Mozilla is not willing and/or able to take the necessary steps, it shows how unavoidable 1984 is.",1371027456

5867160,comment,5866553,5867126,15,0,cturner,,,"Thanks. There&#x27;s a pattern that affects codebases, particularly when they have moved out of initial development and into maintenance.<p>A maintenance programmer is presented with a bug or feature request. To address it, they make adjustments to existing classes to solve it, rather than refactoring the relationships between classes.<p>Over time, functionality accumulates within one or a couple of the original architecture objects. But it&#x27;s no longer really an object-oriented program. Rather, there is a &#x27;God object&#x27; that knows about the internal state of lots of the rest of the system. A related development - the inherited data structures are stretched and stretched to meet needs of a system they&#x27;re no longer suited to represent.<p>Once a codebase crosses over into this swampland, it&#x27;s very difficult to drag it out, because there&#x27;s no longer any unifying principles to guide you in building a supportable application.<p>If you throw unfamiliar programmers at it in the attempt to improve things, there&#x27;s a risk you&#x27;ll make the problem worse, because the key thing is to appreciate where the architecture is, and where it needs to go. New programmers won&#x27;t have the context for that. Often they won&#x27;t even care.<p>I find a strong analogy with government. When a community problem presents, many people will respond, &quot;The government should do something!&quot; In many minds the government is a generic fix-all institution that can right all wrongs.<p>The dynamic suits cynical politicians as much as cynical maintenance programmers. They placate people by throwing some money at the issue while it is in the media cycle. They might hire some people, or tack institutions on. This new momentum does deliver some quick results but re-enforces the dysfunction. By the time that is clear, the people who have benefited from the short-term play have moved on. Often government wasn&#x27;t even an appropriate institution to be involved in addressing the problem.<p>After a time people say, &quot;it&#x27;s impossible to [create good government|write good software].&quot; This is completely untrue, but it&#x27;s easy for that depression to set in when you let media cycles or your manager&#x27;s next bonus payment drive development.",1371027050

My advice is to come up with a memorable name that is less than 10 letters. Think along the lines of Kayak, Hipmunk, Expedia, and Orbitz for inspiration.<p>2. Figure out why your site is different, and make it your focus. Why should I use this site over Kayak? For example, in addition to Kayak, I will check StudentUniverse, a travel aggregator that focuses on students because they offer discounted rates for my age group.<p>3. Pick a niche to start with. For example, one niche is Americans who want to travel to China. Many Americans do not know about Elong, Qunar, or Ctrip. If you make it easy to discover these sites, this will provide value for your users.<p>4. Once you figure out why you are different and you have a picked a target demographic, start driving traffic to your site by contacting people through email, forum posts, and partnerships.<p>Let&#x27;s stick with the example above about Americans going to China. I would first email Americans living in China that are writing blogs, and ask them to let you do a guest post about your site. Write about how it is hard to book hotels in China when you are new to the country, and why your site could be helpful for their readers. Second, I would respond to posts where people have questions about booking hotels in China (Thorn Tree Travel forum, R/China, R/travel, Quora, Twitter). Do not spam or you will get deleted. Provide valuable information as a subject matter expert. Third, set up strategic parternships. For example, trade links with websites related to travel in China but in different industries, such as businesses focused on day tours like visiting the Great Wall.<p>5. I think there is a lot of good literature out there for Google Search Adwords, so I will focus on Google Display Ads. Use the feature that allows you to add a list of sites to display your ads on. Make a list of 250 websites you want target that are relevant to your niche, and only displays ads there. Then track which sites are sending you people that are converting.<p>I hope that helps for now. Feel free to email me to discuss further.",1371026123

5867076,comment,5865680,5866778,6,0,comex,,,"To respond to the quote about &quot;few software innovations identified in recent times&quot;, there&#x27;s been plenty of innovation in the last decade or so.  It might not be quite as fundamental as the innovations of the 20th century - perhaps because all those fundamental things needed to be invented but now have been - but it&#x27;s there.  These are not directly smartphone related, because I agree that most of the innovation of smartphones in particular has been in areas other than computer science, but your posts and the page you linked to are more broadly critical of progress in computer science, and most of them are present in or related to smartphones.  Anyway:<p>SMP - parallelism not among separate, isolated computers whose fastest connection is probably an Ethernet port, but among multiple cores in the same die, accessing the same core RAM.  Of course someone had a SMP system decades ago, it&#x27;s not that complicated an idea, but only recently has it become ubiquitous and critical to taking continued advantage of Moore&#x27;s Law.  Although it&#x27;s fundamentally a hardware innovation, the ways we write multithreaded programs have evolved to take advantage of it - it&#x27;s only recently that the sort of software used on millions of systems has had to focus on fine-grained locking and lock-free algorithms, rather than slapping big locks on everything with the only downside being latency.  And more unorthodox approaches are gaining traction: CSP, though invented 35 years ago, is being rediscovered with Go, various languages have experimented with software transactional memory (e.g. PyPy, Clojure), and Intel&#x27;s new processors will finally bring hardware transactional memory mainstream, which might finally realize the dream of fast transactional memory.<p>GPUs - massive parallelism of relatively small, minimally branching algorithms, again on a single chip found in millions of devices; again, a hardware innovation that requires new ways to write software.  Yes, I know how old the transputer is, but now it&#x27;s mainstream.<p>Virtual machines - a new consummation of the idea of time sharing, innovative in practice if not theory.  It&#x27;s my personal opinion that they&#x27;re a massive hack, a poor man&#x27;s multi-user system that accomplishes no more than a traditional kernel could have, with the right operating system design, with all the kludginess you&#x27;d expect from a system based on hacking kernels designed to run directly on the hardware into running side-by-side - but when disk space and RAM became cheap enough that it became obvious that each user of a server should have their own isolated copy of all software, allowing them to install and maintain whatever versions of whatever packages they need, Unix had developed so much around the idea of a central administrator that the new paradigm had to evolve rather than being designed.  But who cares?  Worse is better, the heritage of Unix and perhaps its conqueror - however it came about, ordinary users of multi-user systems now have more power on average than ever before.  Consider the difference between a PHP script hosted on shared hosting and a modern webapp stack.  And maybe a new design will come around to replace it all, one of these days.<p>Closely related, cloud computing - I suppose driven by the decreasing price of hardware.  The idea of computing as a commodity is hardly new, but in the last few years it has become a reality: virtual servers can now be spun up and down in minutes, as part of massive server farms provided as a service to a huge number of users, for low cost.  This is fundamentally changing the way software is designed: scalability is easier than ever, but it has become more and more useful to write distributed systems that can tolerate internal failure.<p>HTML5.  You can enter a URL and instantly and safely run fast code.  Yes, it&#x27;s just a another VM; yes, Java had this a long time ago.  But we avoided some of Java&#x27;s mistakes and CPUs are faster, so who knows, write-once-run-anywhere might become a reality this time.<p>Sandboxing.  We might still be stuck with C and unsafe code, but sandboxing is starting to make software a lot harder to exploit anyway.  Software security in general is receiving a lot of attention these days.<p>Functional programming and other languages with strong static type systems have had a resurgence lately.  Going back a bit farther, you could say the same about dynamic programming languages such as Python, Ruby, and JavaScript.  There are so many different languages which have taken different paths that it&#x27;s hard to identify a single clear direction that programming languages have gone in, but there are some commonalities, and they add up to a significant amount of incremental innovation.  There is a lot more to say about this, but I&#x27;m getting tired and it would take a lot to do it justice.<p>Ways to write software: test driven development, agile, etc.",1371025016

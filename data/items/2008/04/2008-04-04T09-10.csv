Maybe sometimes you can infer the type, but I doubt that it is possible in general.<p>If the symbols are ""hard linked"", it is not dynamic anymore.<p>I wonder what strategy the LISP dialects out there typically use? I was impressed how easy it is to create an object system in a LISP, but somewhat dismayed because all examples just used (cond) for symbol lookup. Maybe because they were just academic examples, or perhaps they really don't care about performance at all?",1207302582

A friend of mine used to read ""The Lord Of The Rings"" with the ""Middle Earth Atlas"" on hand, in the right chronological order (read only the parts of the story that happen on a particular way). (Edit, just found this site with at least some map annotations to voyage of the beagle: <a href=""http://www.aboutdarwin.com/voyage/voyage01.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aboutdarwin.com/voyage/voyage01.html</a>)<p>Sidenote:

This is because when you exhale, it calms the amygdala, which manages fear.  The pattern of breathing in meditation over time causes a cumulative effect, and you end up with less stress, and less inhibition.  At the same time, if doing a meditation where you direct focus, you are priming parts of your brain involved in focus and attention.  Like I said before, motivation is an equilibrium involving inhibition (potentially caused by fear).  Meditation is great for motivation.<p>I wouldn't go as far as to say most cases of procrastination would be fixed by meditation, though.  Procrastination can have multiple causes.  I'd say a failure to have clearly thought something through or unconscious psychological resistance would be more likely factors in procrastination, and meditation would not remove that stress as readily as logic or psychotherapy would, respectively.",1207300300

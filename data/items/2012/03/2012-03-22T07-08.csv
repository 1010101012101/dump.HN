Have our hot Asians bring you a refreshment or carry you to the lounge area to take a power nap.""<p>What does this reflect? Simply that objectification has much more of an effect when the group being objectified is not the dominant or majority one. Sure you don't care if men are being objectified, but you very well might if you were an ethnic minority and you've been enduring overt or subtle racism all your life. It's the same with women, who in many places still put up with objectification and obviously don't like it.",1332403197

3738847,comment,3736037,3738410,2,0,ht_th,,,"It is not that simple to equate a (perceived) need to escape from women to a mental illness. Female groups do behave differently than male groups in that they assert dominance and rank by psychological means whereas in male groups this happens more via physical means. It can be very hard for both women and men to enter a 'different-gender group', let alone to get accepted and feel comfortable. Especially in fields dominated by one gender, like, for example, construction, programming, education and child care, or health care this lead to problems and strengthens the trend of one-gender dominance.<p>In the last decade or two primary education has become a primarily female field even to that extend that male teachers (and teacher students) have chosen to leave the profession because they didn't feel at home in that environment any more. If you talk to them you'll hear stories about, basically, psychological war-fare among their female colleagues that they didn't want to get involved in but were forced into nonetheless. In these instances feeling the need to escape from women is quite natural.",1332403024

I suppose there's some level of hellishness (say, minimum wage, a continually-ringing phone, and no testing) that would so overwhelm the privilege of writing code that I would eventually only do it on the side, wasting most of my life in a day job doing something mediocre. And there's a lesser level that would shake out only the duds and frauds, like turning the squelch dial on a radio. But it isn't going to happen anytime soon. In the current shortage of developers, even though the industry as a whole would be better off ramping down the astonishing pay and perks which have started attracting people we can't use, each employer defects and tries to outbid the others.<p>Which is why I get concerned at proposals to bring in a lot more disinterested people.

1) Companies are still locked into some solutions like OWA and sharepoint because of which users still use IE at work.
2) Users have started distinguishing between browsers and at home they prefer using Chrome.<p>For companies with most of their clients using their own personal computers (like for us), we could expect a fair share of Chrome over IE and hence the following:
1) Our QA should have a major focus on testing with these browsers.
2) Architecture needs to focus on this stat. as a guiding principle while deciding future architecture.<p>Another interesting statistics is the second screenshot with the Mobile Operating systems.

No, it doesn't make any sense. It completely disingenuous and you don't even realize it. The question you need to address is: <i>why</i> do you want your butt to look good? And the answer is: for the women. Because you want to attract 'female attention'. There is no other reason to care about whether your butt looks good. You could wear any decent pair of trousers that does not show off your butt and the only thing that would change is how much attention you would get from women.<p>And as for 'being commented on': the only reason you even know it looks good, is <i>because</i> people have commented on it, in whatever way.<p>Everything we do, <i>everything</i>, is infused with a desire to mate. You can try to deny that, but that doesn't make it go away. That is exactly what leads to the ""lighten up"" attitude: trying to defend you acting out on your desire to mate.

Your development culture is going to have the biggest impact on how those young programmers go about their tasks.  If you want junior programmers to develop well (software and themselves) you need to attend to the culture they take their cues from.<p>I worked in a near-ideal development culture once.  Twice, I suppose.  Everybody was humble.  Everybody documented their code.  Everybody bounced their ideas off someone; even the smartest guy in the office humbly asked for advice and meant it.  Everyone was quick to assume that if other people thought their code was confusing, then it probably was.  Everyone assumed they should be able to explain their brilliant idea to anyone else on the team and convince them of its value.  Most of what I knew about the codebase at those jobs I learned from guys who knew ten times as much as me drawing diagrams on the whiteboard and asking, ""Do you think this will work?  Or am I being stupid here?""<p>A junior programmer would naturally succeed at the picture-hanging problem in that environment because they'd approach it the same way the star programmers approached their work:  tell other people what they're working on and what they're thinking, and make sure they can articulate and justify an idea before they commit themselves to it.<p>That's the ideal.  Most cultures fall short of that in one way or another.  In a completely opposite situation, if the star programmers work in isolation, disdain to discuss their work with lesser programmers, neglect to document their code, and aspire to write code that no one else understands, junior programmers will learn some very unhelpful lessons.  This is true even if the star programmers are getting shit done and writing efficient, correctly functioning code, because they're basically (and I shudder to use this word because I don't want to start the wrong kind of conversation) peacocking.  They're getting stuff done the hard way and proving they can thrive in a completely unsupportive environment.  There's unspoken machismo, which put into words would sound like this:  ""Nasty opaque codebase?  What's wrong, can't take the complexity, little man?""  ""Gosh, I would have <i>written</i> some comments if I knew <i>some</i> people <i>needed</i> them.""  That's the kind of environment where a programmer is going to either wilt and do something really stupid because they've already given up or ""rise to the challenge"" and try to make a drywall saw using a 3D printer.<p>Take care of the culture:  set a good example, promote respect and humility among your developers, and don't exempt anyone from good practices.

How fast do you think a Chinese game company could clone Skyward Sword? Or even how fast do you think it would take Zynga for that matter? There are other games too, up and down the spectrum of AAA to garage-indie, that I don't think are so easy to copy in a short period of time--especially not short enough that you could dispel the first mover advantage if it was actually something worth copying. There are of course even more technologies outside the game industry that are hard to copy that startups have already gotten in to or even grown into. Amazon seems like a hard company to copy everything they do and still win.<p>What's personally depressed me about all these mobile games and their companies is they're all just circle-jerking and ripping off the same games that came out 10-20 years ago as well as digitalizing games that have been around for hundreds of years, and many of them I think ""I could clone at least 90% of that in a weekend""... I don't think there's anything morally wrong with them, but it's not my cup of tea for what I want to play or how I would want to make money and I do sense a lack of ""taste"".

3738773,comment,3736800,3736800,6,0,ilaksh,,,"He implies that googling a problem will generally lead inexperienced developers to incorrect solutions.  I think this is false.<p>He also assumes that Googling won't be the first thing junior developers do when they are given an unfamiliar task.  Unfortunately, for too many, this is the case.  The solution to that problem is to train junior developers to google.  It sounds like the author of this article also has yet to learn the importance of googling first.<p>A lot of these problems are actually not new and are like the example of the picture.  If you google 'how to hang a picture' you will find good explanations.  You are unlikely to find a lot of people at the top of the search results who are telling you to cut the drywall.<p>When it comes down to SAX versus DOM, that's not really quite comparable to hanging a picture.  In those types of cases, what you say to the junior developer is 'Google it and come back to me when you've found some example code that you are going to start with'.  That way you can guide them if necessary before they get too far in.  Or give them a starting direction, being as explicit as possible (point to code example).<p>If they are googling and coming back with really strange solutions (which, again, you tell them to go over the outline of the solution with you before they start implementing it), then maybe they don't have the intellectual capacity or experience for the tasks you are giving them.<p>On the second half of this post, he is also wrong.  The timid and tentative developers will probably often get along fine with the more senior developers, because they are going to be happy to do things exactly the way they tell them and won't talk back.  Part of the time they will be so clueless that they can't get anything done, and since they don't use Google they won't get anywhere but the others will be careful to follow the lead of the senior developers.  So the traditional approaches will be passed on and everyone will be happy.<p>Anyway in the end he more or less gets to his conclusion which is reasonable enough, although stated in a way which I find to be somewhat arrogant.  I think the entire basis for this was a fair amount of wasted time which was at least partly the fault of the more senior developer not providing initial guidance or checking in on the junior developer.<p>It IS definitely helpful when developers, whatever their experience level, are secure and modest enough to ask for other people's knowledge, opinions and help freely.  I have found this to be rare.  Too often asking questions is simply interpreted quite stupidly to mean that the other developer is ignorant.  And also quite stupidly, not know literally everything is interpreted as ignorance.<p>To boil it down, the author sounds like a dick, should take some responsibility for the wasted development effort that he is trying to put all on the junior developer, should learn to Google himself, read my post, learn to ask questions himself, and work very hard at cloaking his arrogance when he speaks to the junior developer.  And no I do not know who this person is and am not actually related to the situation.  Article just pushes some of my buttons.",1332400619

This means I run a web server, db and multiple browsers.  I don't use an IDE.  I need raw processing horsepower.<p>Paying for incremental processor speed is a waste of money.  Get the slowest current generation processor you can.  Paying for an extra 10-20 percent is a mistake.<p>RAM is king as modern OSs use it efficiently.  Mysql can suck its datafiles into memory. Never forget RAM is 1000000x faster than disk.<p>Max it.  2G is a minimum.  4G is good.  A soon as I can cram 16G into a machine, I'll try.<p>I could care less about the graphics subsystem.  If I could buy a low power version of last years card, I would.<p>A fast drive is nice, but the money is better spent on more RAM.  I don't think 5400 vs 7200 is enough.  And you lose battery life.<p>Many of my criteria are designed to maximize my battery life.  I love working untethered.<p>If I could, I would buy a machine that could use multiple batteries, like the old wallstreets and pismos.   As is, a removeable battery is critical for long flights.  Sorry Air.<p>The air travel point may be moot becauae the TSA does't want us carrying extra batteries.<p>Bus speed matters when it impacts RAM usage.  I don't understand this well enough and so cargo cult myself into buying the Pro machines.  If someone can convince me otherwise, I would love to save $1000 and get a consumer MacBook.<p>It had to be able to plug into a gigantic monitor when I am deskbound.<p>I used to want a PC card slot.  I would jam in  big memory card and use that as a external drive for DB files.  Voila!  Cheap SSD!<p>I with removeable media drives were themselves removeable.  I use writeable DVDs for long term backups, but do not need the drive 95 percent of the time.<p>Finally, the most pixels I can carry and fit on my lap.  I am a little guy.  The 17"" is too big to carry or fit.  The weight of just over 5 lbs is what I have gotten used to and can tolerate.",1205584748

137494,comment,137408,137408,0,0,xirium,,,"From the article: When you think of Firewire, you really should just think of a cable coming directly out of your system's DRAM banks. That's basically all Firewire is.<p>Shouldn't DMA transfer only be initiated from <i>inside</i> a host? That's really scary.",1205584203
137493,comment,136759,137350,0,0,davidw,,,"> Europe may not have fallen so much as that other places have risen.<p>Right.  There are tons of cool things in tech (Linux, Python, Mysql, Qt/KDE, off the top of my head) and the sciences in Europe, just that there are more in the US.",1205584071

137489,comment,137486,137486,0,0,bdfh42,,,"Not so much optimise as prioritise. I don't think I have ever found an optimal solution.<p>My most recent laptop purchase had to allow me to carry it as part of my single item of hand baggage on Europe's low cost airlines - together with enough clothing and other personal stuff to last me a week - a tall order.<p>Thus weight was a severe limiting factor - but there was no point in having a machine that could not run my development tools and their supporting databases, internet servers etc.<p>So (as I said) weight was a fixed limit, I then prioritised screen resolution, RAM and finally processing power.",1205583511

How can you sell it if you're giving it away for free on the site?  How can you buy it if you can't read about it?<p>That doesn't mean that an idea has no <i>value</i>, it means that it's impossible to transform into money.  Or, if not quite impossible, that the transaction costs outweigh the value of such a market (I'm not convinced of the value of the original poster's idea:-)<p>BTW, I explained this a year ago:<p><a href=""http://journal.dedasys.com/articles/2007/04/26/ideas-are-worthless"" rel=""nofollow"">http://journal.dedasys.com/articles/2007/04/26/ideas-are-wor...</a>",1205583237

Not a good sign for my primary development machine.<p>So now I am in the market for a new machine.<p>While pondering my purchase, I realized I had strong opinions of what mattered and what didn't, of where it made sense to spend my very limited startup budget.<p>I will list my criteria below and am interested in how others optimize their decisions.",1205582663

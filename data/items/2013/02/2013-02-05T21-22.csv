There are numerous more violent or dangerous sports, like boxing, MMA, or even NHL hockey (which as straight-up fist fights) that are not nearly as popular.<p>The sport is far less dangerous or violent today than it was 20 years ago, but it's far <i>more</i> popular. The NFL has reigned in the violence with rules like illegal contact on receivers, hits on defenseless receivers, roughing the passer, spearing, chop-blocking, face mask, blow to the head, horsecollar tackle, etc.--and as they have done so the game has only gained in popularity.

Many people don't dry their hands because they have to use the hot air blowers, which they know are ineffective. If they see an effective device, some members of that group will choose to use it instead of jazz handing. But even discounting those people, the wash + dry combination still works out better for most cases I can devise. The only universe I have come up with where wash and then dry else where is better than washing and drying at the same station is if there are an equal number of paper towel dispensers as there are to sinks, which has never happened in a bathroom where the number of sinks > 2, as far as I know.<p>> By combining faucet and dryer you force these people into the same bottleneck as the hand-dryer users.<p>I wasn't arguing for optimizing any one special interest groups time spent in the bathroom, I was optimizing for the total network throughput of the bathroom.",1360101011

I expect that with time, the only way to use this properly will involve creating ""channels"" with tagging or filtering.<p>There are two major problems with this outcome. Firstly, if users select their own ""channels"", it becomes a reinforcing cycle where each ""channel"" (or ""room"") is only exposed to its own conversation. This is largely what happened with USENET (and to a degree what happens with subreddits), and while each one might be good if it stays small, if it doesn't it'll end up being as noisy as the front page. If managed well, on the other hand, I expect that the prettiness of conversations as they are now will follow nicely into each channel.<p>The second problem with the noisy front page is that as with every other general purpose discussion site with a front page, there will be a race to the bottom, where everything that makes it to the front page will be about grumpy cats or hot girls.<p>Maybe my criticisms stem from the very nature of discussion forums (look at the cycle of slashdot, digg, reddit etc.), but I don't see this tech fixing that problem like Stack Overflow claims to have solved the Q&A problem.

But one thing that Javascript, Python and Ruby programmers would expect of higher order function support is the ability to use the general collection methods such as map, reduce, filter (or inject, collect, fold - whatever they are called in your language). So far as I can tell, generalized functions of these types are not really possible. You could write some that were typed interface{} and then did explicit casts in the closures you passed, but that would not be nearly as elegant as what other languages provide. I believe in a static type system without generics this is not really possible, and this is really (to me) the most painful cost from the lack of generic support.",1360100564

5173344,comment,5170424,5171919,3,0,btilly,,,"(This is long, but the td;lr is that there actually is a surprising and reasonable criteria for what is a science, and it probably doesn't draw the line where you want.)<p><i>So, part of what i'm saying is that it'd be nice if people would stop dismissing other fields as ""not science"" :P</i><p>Are you, then, going to argue that we should call Scientology a science?  If not, why not?  And aren't you calling other fields ""not really science"" once you have done so?<p>I have an unambiguous definition of ""science"" that seems kind of obvious.  What journal would people in your field aspire to publish their best research in?  Of the people who publish there, what journal would they like to publish their best work in?  And so on.  If this chain does not lead in short order to the journal <i>Nature</i>, you are not a science.<p>By this criteria, mathematics is a scientific field.  (That's the biggest downside of this classification - math is not a science.  But here gets lumped in as one.)  So is physics.  So is chemistry.  Biology.  Climate science.  And many more.  But linguistics and sociology are not.  Nor is any ""social science"".  Nor, of course, is Scientology.<p>Why would that work?  The reason goes back to an observation of Thomas Kuhn's.  In a mature science, there is a shared paradigm, creating shared beliefs about what work is likely to be important, what work is not.  Because of that paradigm, work of very different kinds can be compared reasonably fairly.  (Not perfectly, but fairly enough that you can reasonably identify the top papers, and have a top journal.)  Furthermore the relative unanimity from that field over time leads to people outside that field believing that people in that field actually have made progress.  Eventually that can lead to a paradigm shared across that field and others, which allows a fair amount of agreement about the relative value of research in very, very different areas.<p>The integration of a field into the cross-disciplinary value systems shared across sciences will lead to that field's top papers becoming acceptable to broader cross-disciplinary journals.  And, once that has happened, you have been fitted into a chain of relative prestige that goes right up to what is generally recognized as the top journal of all time, <i>Nature</i>.<p>This structure used to be less obvious.  But in recent decades the emergence of the scientific citation index, and the measurement of journal impact factors have put precise numbers on ""how prestigious is this journal"" and ""how broadly is this journal read"".  This has lead to a feedback loop making researchers more inclined to put papers into top journals, which leads to better sorting by value.  And this same work has made the differing citation structures between ""real sciences"" and less mature fields of study abundantly clear.  (A clarity that was promptly used by publishers.  Now that everyone knows the relative value of given journals, prices could be raised for top ones.  Giving rise to the serials crisis.)<p>One important disclaimer.  Nothing in what I say should be taken by people in ""soft sciences"" as a blanket indictment of the quality of their work.  Their lack of shared paradigms reflects the complexity of their subjects, and the resulting difficulty for someone taking approach A to present convincing arguments to people taking another approach B that this is a better way to look at things than approach B is.  This does not mean that there is not really good work going on with both groups.  But it does not result in agreement, simple externally visible signs of progress, or shared value judgements about the relative importance of different kinds of research.  And outsiders don't have easy access to any sign posts suggesting what work is likely to be high quality, and what work is mostly BS.<p>And a final note.  In my experience, what I just said is obvious to people in the hard sciences, and unbelievable to people in the social sciences.  For people in the hard sciences, having a reasonably shared value system about very different research across a variety of fields is just how things are.  For people in the social sciences, it doesn't make sense that two people studying radically different things will have any kind of shared value system.  As a fun example, go to one psychologist, and ask for a list of the 10 most important discoveries in psychology in the last 40 years.  Take that list to another random psychologist, see how few of them the second has even heard of.  Repeat the same experiment with two physicists, and see how many of the first one's top 10 would be in the top 10 list for the other.  (The exact order will vary, but there will be substantial agreement.)",1360099874

People ask questions, remark on current events, debate and discuss and create a long-term record of thoughtful discussions.<p>But Discourse appears to be geared more towards the community aspects of a forum.  Mentions between members of a community are relevant in this case, since it gets users into threads and posting.  Real-time features lower the friction of using the software and increase rapid-fire communication (we call that ""banter"") between members.  Avatars on the topic index make it easy to see which of your friends are posting in which threads, so you can better decide where to go next.<p>For this group, forums represent a ""Third Place""[1] community outside of their home and workplace groups. I've been building forums software similar to Discourse, on my own for the past year, wagering that this second group of users is larger than the first, and that their needs are only accidentally addressed by the current generation of forums software.

Sinatra is much more lightweight Ruby framework that I personally think is more appropriate when starting out. It offers far fewer abstractions (or, ""magic"") and is a radically simpler beast. To put some numbers on that assertion, the codebase itself is less than 1/100th the size of Rails.<p>If working with a different language, I recommend starting with some similar level of abstraction.

Two tricks:<p>1)  Print out the alphabet and hang it in the bathroom, at eye level. But after a time it becomes invisible.<p>2)  Flash cards with words that contain the letters you know least.

Props to soundsop.<p>On several different occasions I've brought up the Wikipedia page on discrete cosine transforms and hoped to understand it. This selection was made because DCTs are apparently fundamental algorithms for lossy data compression like that found in JPEGs or MP3s or whatever. I want to be able to write decoders for these things -- I've poked around in mplayer's source and want to change stuff, want to create a JPEG decoder as proof-of-concept to myself, etc.<p>But, here's the hitch: I have no mentionable background in mathematics. I got up to geometry in high school (i.e., I know cosines in triangles but have no idea what a cosine wave is, how it works, and/or how they're related if at all). Where can I learn all of the things I need to learn for these things to make sense to me, and to become blessed with the skills and understanding necessary to create and/or decode such algorithms? I need something somewhat simple and plain, something I don't have to chain through five hundred articles to understand -- that's the problem with WP; I don't understand one thing, so middle-click it, do that about ten times per math article, including on the articles I opened to understand the first article, and there's a never-ending lot of WP articles for me to read, and that's not really tenable. I need something focused on teaching, not necessarily technical precision and exhaustiveness.<p>I know what a logarithm is, I looked it up. I've also tried #math on Freenode but those dudes just don't know how to talk to someone without any mathematical training. Ask for a simple explanation there, it's usually kind of funny.<p>Please help me. Thanks. : )",1233359001

458920,comment,458663,458875,0,0,LogicHoleFlaw,,,"This is slightly less true than it used to be. The table length ""#"" operator returns the index of the largest integer key continuously reachable from the index at 1. (i.e. there can be no integer keys with nil values in between). This, as well as a handful of standard library operators, rely on the index-from-1 convention.<p>Tables in Lua can be thought of as discrete mappings of any value as key, to any value as value. The reference implementation happens to have the property that if you index from 1 upwards by increments of 1 that all of those values are kept in a single C array which is then subscripted in the usual fashion. It's a handy thing to know when you decide how to lay out your data. The ""dictionary"" portion of the table only springs into existence when something is actually inserted into it.<p>Actually if I understand correctly, an empty Lua table is basically just a pointer to a minimal structure in memory, so it can be used for identity comparisons and so on where only uniqueness is necessary, rather than a full array+dict functionality with the associated memory overhead.<p>Lua tables are extremely flexible and powerful.

Maybe when you say ""consumers"" you have in mind a random sample from all Windows customers.<p>As for ""consumers"" in the vernacular sense of natural persons, I think the cost of switching from Windows to MacOS X or GNU/Linux is not more than the cost of moving from Windows to Windows.

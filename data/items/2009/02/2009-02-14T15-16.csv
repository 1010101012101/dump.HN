It's useful, for example, if you want the labels in one column and the form controls in another.<p>Make sure to have the label take the maximum available space; if you have a label centered in a table cell you want the label to span the whole cell so it's easier to click on it to select the associated control.",1234626959

He's talking about the people _here_:<p>""It's too bad that the US didn't...""<p>""...its[sic] pretty asinine, ... and USA is stuck using obsolete...""<p>This has nothing to do with the metric system: You could define a hypothetical Z0 paper size as 42.81"" x 30.27"", a square yard, and then define paper sizes Z1, Z2, and so forth. Each would be half the area of the previous by performing the same operation. It's not as if 210 or 297 are particularly easy numbers to deal with, or that having precisely a square meter of material is all that important. Is it important that a sheet of A4 paper is about one eighth of a square meter?<p>And in defense of US Letter, its proportions are closer to the golden ratio than A4, which looks too skinny for me. But they're both too wide for letter writing; I think either octavo-sized or A5 paper is a more natural width for printing or hand-writing a single column of text. Bringhurst's Elements of Typographic Style – to mention one of a potential dozen or so authorities – recommends text columns be a maximum of about two alphabets of lowercase characters.",1234624829

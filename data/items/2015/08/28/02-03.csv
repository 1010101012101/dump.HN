A significant portion of drivers also deal with winter/icy conditions for at least part of the year, and I have a really hard time believing that self-driving cars will be able to handle those conditions well, at least not for a long time. You have snow falling, snow covering many/most of the lines on the road, varying degrees of traction - added to the uncertainties of pedestrians, construction, other crazy drivers, etc. Heck, the sensors alone are going to have an inch of snow and ice on them after being outdoors for a couple of hours. Winter driving is hard enough for highly-focused human drivers, making decisions that are often based on factors that don&#x27;t easily translate into algorithms and computer models.<p>Google speaks of a need to leapfrog the driver assistance systems and instead focus on fully-automated driving systems because the driver assistance technologies won&#x27;t incrementally improve to the level we need for full driver-less cars[1]. I think that&#x27;s a fair point, but I&#x27;d go one step further: self-driving cars thrown into a mix of human-operated vehicles and roads that aren&#x27;t specifically designed for self-driving cars is (in my opinion) a similar mistake. I believe we&#x27;ll reach a point very soon where great technical advances in the vehicle alone will have diminishing returns in terms of safety on the road.<p>If we are going to solve this problem once and for all, I&#x27;d be much more enthusiastic about a self-driving system that operates only on distinct roads/lanes/tracks that are designed only for self-driving vehicles. Perhaps that&#x27;s an unreasonable expectation, but trying to design systems that anticipate and make decisions based on the (often irrational) behaviors of other human drivers seems no different than designing a full human-level artificial intelligence - and even then, it&#x27;ll still be prone to mistakes because other humans are involved.<p>Either we get to the point where all vehicles on public roads are networked and cooperating through software to self-drive, or we&#x27;re just making guesses about other people&#x27;s behaviors.

All we have to do is build a CO2 power plant. We can use a candle and have infinity energy. Actually, no one else need more than a candle to do anything else. If we follow it to conclusion, we can melt the Golden Gate bridge with a candle.<p>Any high school kid should be able to debunk this whole hallucinatory craziness that has spread in our society because nowadays no one care to spare a minute to actually think about the absurdity of the things they hear here and there. And oh, if its on CNN, or someone with &quot;credentials&quot; said it, then of course it is true. Well good luck.<p>There is no significant ocean level change. Ask the Dutch. The moment they flee the Netherlands, then we may talk.<p>Glaciers are rescinding because that is what they have been doing since the end of the last ice age (otherwise we would still be on a ice age). They didn&#x27;t started rescinding 30 years ago, or 150 years ago. It is an ongoing process. Like climate is an ongoing process. It is not &quot;climate change&quot;, as a noun, it&#x27;s climate changeS, as sentence. It has been doing so for, at least, the past 4 billion years. That is the &quot;norm&quot;, that it changes. Sometimes those changes are just more accentuated. There is absolutely no evidence (despite what everyone wants to convince themselves, wants to &quot;believe&quot; - science has gone from this a long time ago!) for CO2, let alone human influence on climate on a global scale.<p>The article on The Guardian is deceitful. They should actually explain how they got to the 97%. Not that it matter anyway. Science is not a democracy; otherwise we could all &quot;vote&quot; for a free-gravity day so we could all enjoy a day floating.<p>Those proposing the AGW cannot prove or advance their point. Models are video-games. Shall we start giving driver&#x27;s licence to those scoring high on Need for Speed? It&#x27;s a model, they are conceived to increase temperature if you increase CO2. That&#x27;s what it&#x27;s going to do. It is programmed to do just that, because that is how it was conceived.<p>That is in no way to say we should not look for renewable resources (since the other one will eventually end anyway), nor that we should go on living like there&#x27;s no tomorrow (for certainly there won&#x27;t be). CO2 is not a pollutant. It is a fundamental element for life and it makes not direct harm.<p>If we continue on this path of demonizing the CO2 the consequences will be way worse than a thousand degrees increase in temperature.<p>Clime do changes and all the living creatures on this planet will face it. We must adapt, but we cannot change it. Not for better anyway and if we try we&#x27;ll just make thing a thousand times worse. Drought will come, tempests, hurricanes, tornadoes, tsunamis, volcanoes, they will come (and go) no matter what. We should and do need to be as prepared to them as possible, but we cannot stop those phenomena from happening, no more than we can hold the Sun in the middle of the sky.<p>What should be addressed is what to do. Because when changes comes and they will indeed come, regardless, it won&#x27;t care about political borders, religion, skin color, gender, age.<p>This has long ceased to be a scientific debate. The science part is very simple: they cannot sustain their arguments and the hypothesis fails. Now the political/religious debate is another matter entirely. And that is the most important one, because it can makes us slaves (Hitler will look like a kindergarten prankster), or it can condemn half or more of the population of the world to its own luck.<p>There should be no debate. There is no men made global warming by CO2. But climate do changes and will change. The Sahara was not always a desert. Nor the Amazon was always a forest. It&#x27;s not us; that&#x27;s just Nature. But we should control pollution (air, soil and water), try to improve recycling (still very inefficient), have better, renewable and more efficient sources, means of transportation and storage of energy. We should do that for all the right reasons and not the wrong one; certainly not based on lies and deceits.<p>And we do need to understand the issue. This is one of the most challenging points in human life. It is certainly the most important issue of at least the past ten thousand years. The science of it is actually not complicated at all (high school knowledge). It doesn&#x27;t mean we understand how it works; but we can certainly say how it doens&#x27;t work.

Obviously this effect is less important when the true effect size is large enough - in high-powered studies.

That&#x27;s a reasonable presumption.<p>That&#x27;s just begging the question. We may be able to attribute some proportion of statistical inequality to factors other than injustice, or affirmatively attribute some proportion to specific injustice, but we will never be able to fully explain everything.<p>If you assume malice in all cases of uncertainty then it becomes impossible to recognize defeat of the injustice. Once you have actually defeated it you end up fighting your own shadow forever because the biased assumption always tells you that you haven&#x27;t.<p>> From 1970 to 2010, the proportion of women earning medical or law degrees increased from under 10% to almost 50%. That was, in part, the result of affirmative action measures to increase the representation of women. But those measures are no longer necessary and no longer applied. The new ratios are self-perpetuating.<p>Those anecdotes don&#x27;t generalize unless you assume the conclusion again. We don&#x27;t know what the equilibrium proportion of women in each profession is &quot;supposed&quot; to be. Some professions may already be near their only stable equilibrium even if they are heavily unbalanced. Even the idea that there <i>is</i> a &quot;correct&quot; stable equilibrium proportionality in every profession is flawed. There could be professions with tipping points such that whichever sex dominates the culture becomes a substantial majority.<p>> The point that people preoccupied with short-term injustice miss is that skewed gender ratios in professions are often the result of past discrimination and so are in and of themselves a continuing injustice. All else being equal, a rational person would rather enter a profession where they will not face career headwinds as a minority than one where they will.<p>Being prohibited by law or violence from working a job because of your sex or race is an injustice. Being the first woman or minority in the old boy&#x27;s club is a challenge. They are not the same thing. And the subtlety of the latter is not amenable to fine tuning via Uncle Sam&#x27;s sledgehammer.<p>> The opposition to that is an emotional rather than a rational argument. The rational approach is to look at the net level of injustice integrated over time.<p>&quot;In the long run we are all dead.&quot; -John Maynard Keynes<p>It isn&#x27;t irrational to consider justice on a timescale that affects the people who are alive today.",1440727363

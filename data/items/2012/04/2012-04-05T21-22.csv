3804857,comment,3804134,3804555,2,0,mathetic,,,"tl;dr: My recent observation is that for US universities it is better to be jack of all trades but master of nothing than having some degree of (relative) expertise.<p>You do not declare it officially and yes you have the flexibility to change it but every application asks you what major you want to study.<p>Besides by nature if you are already decided and experienced on the subject it is ridiculous to me to consider another applicant. Let's consider two candidates:<p>1) Super social kid with strong grades in all subjects and a good debater and organized few charity projects (at least on the paper) but no real programming or above average math experience.<p>2) Kid with good social skills with top grades in mathematics, physics, chemistry, cs etc. but slightly lower secondary language or history grades. This kid also has a Github account with quite a few commits and is hacking for few years now.<p>Now my recent observation is that (and not only for CS but for all other subjects too) if these two candidates declare that they want to study CS, then the first one is preferred in US and definitely the second one in Britain.<p>Now I understand not declaring your major at the beginning and being undecided but how can one eliminates the ones who already demonstrate work and passion on their subject but accepts the ones who are undecided and have not done on any specific subject.<p>As a result, American universities basically depend on ""luck"". They think the kid might be good based on generic projects, charity work and conferences.<p>By the way this is not a personal issue. I am accepted to the school I wanted to be in at the beginning but this is an observation through my high school years for over 200-300 well suited candidates for top ranking universities.",1333663179
3804856,comment,3804506,3804506,5,0,tzs,,,"> Everyone has a favorite teacher, but no one has a favorite textbook<p>I disagree. I bet if you went over to Reddit and asked on /r/math or /r/physics, you'd find plenty of people who have a favorite textbook. For example, I'd say Apostol's ""Calculus"", volume 1, is a favorite textbook of mine. I've read it 3 or 4 times over the last 30 years. The Feynman Lectures on Physics are another favorite of mine.<p>> 4x more expensive/less accessible/same form factor<p>(that's from their infographic, comparing textbooks in the '60s to now. It was on three lines there, which I've marked with slashes to fit the quote on one line)<p>Based on inflation, they should be about 6x more expensive, so if that 4x figure is right textbook prices have improved since the '60s. However, I suspect that they are a little low in their estimate here. I think prices have gone up faster than inflation.<p>I don't see how text books have become less accessible since the '60s.<p>> Theres one other major concern: textbooks are just flat-out terrible products. Theyre ineffective pedagogical tools: dense collections of long-form text that fail to engage students wide range of learning styles<p>This may be true for the less technical fields, but I have yet to see anything better for, say, a rigorous upper level math course.",1333663155

The style gives the impression that Reginald is claiming ""this really happened, and those people used this technique, and they lived happily ever after  so if it worked for them, it will work for you; give this technique a try"". But this tale never happened, so that implied argument is a lie. This story forces me to put on my ""disbelieve, disbelieve, disbelieve"" mental filters as I read, so I can remind myself that the story does not have the grounds in reality it claims, lest I believe it wrongly. This extra effort would not be necessary if Reginald just claimed what he claims straight out, and then perhaps described his grounds for belief in those claims.

If you could essentially do that you could have hundreds of these processors emulated for the cost of managing the IO to them.<p>I am not expecting it to be ""Magic Speed Juice"", I am actually expecting to be getting 1-5% performance from what the GPU are capable of. However I would see this as a nett advantage if it took the workload off the CPU. Something like Knights Corner could easily do this (its basically a pentium 1 core).<p>The point I am making is that Notch's CPU is basically a home computer CPU from the 80s. They don't require that much functionality to emulate (as if a dozen emulators in a few hours wasn't a good enough indication) and since OpenCL is turing complete you can emulate anything (see running arm linux on an 8 bit processor), the question is if its efficient enough to be viable?<p>Can a 1ghz stream processor emulate a 10mhz single issue simple risc core?

3804818,comment,3802515,3802734,1,0,cube13,,,"I don't think this is really an analogy.  This chain occurs with both in both physical manufacturing and software.  In both, developers/design engineers design the product, leads make sure that everything stays within budget and time, and product managers get requirements through sales or marketing staff.  There really isn't a difference with either process at all, and for software that's sold on physical copies, it's is the exact same process.  The major difference between releasing software on the internet and making a physical product is the end of the entire process, where the product is built and sent to the customer.  With a physical product, it has to be built, stored until sold, then shipped out.<p>Also, unless your developers are so misanthropic that putting them in front of a client might just cause wars to break out, most of this chain can be circumvented by involving all parts of the chain in requirements gathering.  The key part of the beer game is that none of the parties can talk to any party that's more than one link away from them.<p>Finally, and this is myself being a nitpicky bastard, but the operations manager will almost never have direct contact with a client.  They will be the ones that work with the developers, the leads, product managers, and suppliers to make sure that the product can actually be made with the given budget, and that every step of the production chain is working correctly.  They will also work with marketing and sales to make sure that the projected demand will be met, and that the product actually gets out to the clients.  A better position would be sales people, because they are generally the only point of contact users have with the manufacturer.",1333662653

3804793,comment,3802516,3804101,4,0,drostie,,,"At the risk of coming off as one of the maligned ""personal opinion"" people, I have to object a little to (2). That may be the general issue, I could agree, but it's not <i>my</i> issue.<p>Because <i>my</i> issue is the sheer <i>length</i> and <i>complexity</i> of the GPL; I have read it and I do not pretend to understand it, and I don't personally as a developer want to release under a license whose implications I don't really understand. The problems just start with Section 1 and accumulate from there.<p>For me, the nastiest part is not really the copyleft or DRM so much as the no-linking aspect of GPL. I still don't know what precisely constitutes ""linking"". I don't know whether Python is in violation of the GPL because the standard library has a readline module, and I don't know if my own code is in violation of the GPL because it's written in Python. GPLv3 actually made this point a little clearer; in GPLv3 you would say ""Python as a whole plus its readline library is probably GPL, but as long as you don't write 'import readline' you could probably release under something else instead."" Now that there is a BSD version of readline called editline, I wonder if even that analysis holds. But the GPL makes even this analysis complicated, because if Python <i>forgot to mention</i> that the whole package was GPL, then actually their license to readline can potentially be revoked <i>at any time</i> by the readline copyright holders.<p>And there are some nasty parts too, like the ongoing incompatibility between the Eclipse Public License and the GPL. You now have people explaining how to get readline and wrap Clojure in a readline interface (which is allowed) because Clojure presumably isn't allowed to connect directly to readline in its own REPL.<p>LGPL, at least, I don't have to worry about this crap when building an application which uses yours as a tool. You can license under LGPL if you really think that GPL's legal phrasing is absolutely magnificent and you love it. I don't want to release under such an ugly license myself, and GPL forces me to violate my aesthetic principles.<p>So, never mind, some guy whining about GPL over here.

You can simply eat less or buy less expensive food. Not great options, but possible. On the other hand, if you income level drops, it's can be very difficult to reduce housing costs fast. Thus I would think that people are more vulnerable to unexpected drops in income.<p>Same thing goes for medical costs. It can be very difficult to reduce those without sacrificing health.<p>Another big issue is that in 1962 most households were single income. Most mothers were at home. If the husband lost his job, there were 2 potential wage earners that could theoretically renter the job market to regain the needed income. Today most households are dual income, and require all of that income to pay the bills. So if one personal loses their job, there isn't a backup worker able to enter the workforce if needed.

At best it says, we know you know that engineering is not a field your interested in because your a woman which is why we're focusing on the fact that you're a woman in our recruiting pitch, and so we're offering you a 'bonus' of $Xk. I was aghast when the NYT article ( dave-to-girl ratio ) linked mentioned that ""Most women think, 'I'm going to be in a cubicle at Microsoft typing next to some guys who smell funny."" if they go into computer science. Because clearly all women make decisions on whether to enter a field based on some absurdly gross overgeneralization of that field. And even if every engineer in the world smelled like a sewer rat, to list that as the first/most important/first mentioned reason women don't want to become engineers is disgusting in the first order.<p>Here's an idea.  Why don't we do real research into what cultural factors influence men and women into going into different fields, and then decide to act on those cultural factors.

While there are certainly fundamental principles to design, there really isn't a technology of design in the sense that you can teach it in a manner that always translates to successful execution.  In other words, you can learn the recipe but still botch the meal.  Not because you don't understand the principles, but because you lack the instincts (built through practice and observation) to understand how to communicate through design.<p>The best method I've found for learning design (aside from actually doing it) is to take note of designs that strike you and really dig into them.  Ask yourself why the designer might have made the choices he did.  How has the designer used line, shape, texture, color and space to achieve a sense of balance and unity (or their opposites).  What has the designer chosen to emphasize?  Why?  Take notice of all the small and subtle elements that contribute to the overall feel of the design.<p>As for the technical side, well that stuff isn't too hard.  There is an abundance of material covering CSS, HTML and Javascript. Tutsplus has some excellent free courses and tutorials. As do the sites that sebphfx mentions.<p>Just remember not to confuse development with design.  Knowing CSS and Javascript doesn't make you any more of a designer than my 3 year old nephew.

Its just that when hiring, I can easily overlook a spelling mistake if I think the candidate may be that one in one hundred.<p>ANOTHER THOUGHT: To be fair, spelling mistakes are a lot closer to the line than cultural fit or politics or things like gender and race. You cant change your race to suit the job. Things like your politics are changeable, but unless you have a strong ethical objection to the companys line of business (I have declined to work on contract with a Tobacco company), its in societys best interests for you to be able to keep your political views without being swayed by your employer.<p>Spelling on a cover letter is a different matter. Most people dont have a disability that prevents them from getting it right, and there is no greater benefit to society in forcing employers to ignore spelling.

3804651,comment,3804055,3804055,3,0,drostie,,,"I would like to add that one of the points in the discussion was a simple application of a much broader point. Chen says, ""It's bad enough that your own marketing efforts drive down channel performance, but usually once your marketing efforts are working, your competitors quickly follow.""<p>The broader point is to think about the world in terms of feedback loops -- what we might call <i>feedback theories</i>. Our modern understanding of nuclear chain reactions works this way; once you get above a certain density, a neutron will be likely enough to hit a fissionable isotope, that the average number of neutrons produced per neutron is more than 1.0 -- then the neutron makes itself more likely, the chain reaction grows exponentially with positive feedback, and boom. Otherwise it will just peter out to 0 from negative feedback. Evolution by natural selection is also a feedback theory, if you focus on the genes themselves.<p>Coming back to the economic examples, it is now considered a relatively good economic model to assume that the stock market already knows everything that there is to potentially know about a company. If you just imagine that there was some person who magically started moving money to the day's top performers, you can reasonably envision that others might try to jump on this magical predictor, then attempted to bail out just before they did -- but so many would potentially sign up for this that it would damp that predictor's own profits to have a massive sell-off just before they were supposed to sell themselves, negative feedback. It's thought that on a smaller scale this would tend to happen with insider knowledge. Or, for another econ 301 example, there is a powerful argument that competitive markets are efficient, because they must be among the least profitable markets around. Why must they be the least profitable? Because if competing is easy, then anyone in a less profitable market cuts their losses and jumps into the competitive market instead, which concentrates profits in the market they're leaving and dilutes profits in the market they're joining. And if there's no profit, there's no room for inefficiency. (There's also a sort of odd pseudo-Marxist corollary: that agents within a market always want the market to be less competitive, so that their profits can be higher.)<p>Anyway, the law of shitty clickthroughs amounts, I think, to a particular feedback theory of marketing. If you market well, that generates negative feedback, both in the form of people following your example, and in the form of people getting desensitized to your ads.",1333660229

Even more, the name uses an odd spelling for one of the terms.<p>I did some research and found that my first use in commerce bested her by at least 3 weeks, so I applied for the trademark, and contacted her to make sure that she knew that I was using the name (But, I was nice!

3412947,comment,3412858,3412858,0,0,Jach,,,"It's great that hackers everywhere are thumping their chests waiting for the bill to pass so they can prove their flavor of a circumvention scheme works. I don't think anything extra needs to be created from what we have already apart from perhaps easier-to-use interfaces for the plebs. Software, in particular encryption everywhere, is the only viable solution, and we can still use existing hardware.<p>A satellite seems like a stupid idea though. It can easily be shot down (as both the US and China have demonstrated), costs a lot to get up there (where's this money coming from?), and is technically a weapon of mass destruction (as are all things in space).<p>Side-note: it was kind of hard to read this, I'm assuming the author's first language isn't English...

Another popular algorithm is median cut which uses an  k-d tree to recursively subdivide the color space based on the median color values of the pixels in the source image.

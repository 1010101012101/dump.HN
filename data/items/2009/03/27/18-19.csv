I think much of the post's content can be treated somewhat humorously, e.g. he is using the Love, Hate, Love Again title as more of a metaphor than a description of his real feelings for PG. Some stuff might be a little extreme (like screaming ""I Love you, PG!"") but do you want to crucify (allusion to your use of JC) him for showing a little emotion? Plus it lightens the reading of the post. Imagine a bland person's post on his love, hate, love again relationship with PG: ""His stuff excited me, then it didn't, then it did again."" Lame.<p>I get the feeling from your very own comment that you are attempting to unfold a much grander thought of yours by taking this guy's blog post out of context.

So Russians will tell me to just say it in English bec most have a better grasp of English than I have of Russian, they&#x27;ll speak to me in Russian, and I to them in English.<p>About the Phone thing: When I get someone from South East Asia for customer support, I ask them to speak phonetically in the most courteous way possible, this was after yelling at a few reps who just didn&#x27;t understand a word I was saying, nor I them. I felt there had to be a better way than to berate someone for just trying to do his job (somehow the women were easier to understand, probably just the luck of the draw). Anyway I highly recommend it to everyone who complains about bad customer rep phone calls, learn the Phonetic Alphabet (I have a copy taped to my wall for easy access) (Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, Delta, Echo, etc). It may be a little slower but if they don&#x27;t like it they&#x27;ll just transfer you to their supervisor or to someone with a better grasp and no one feels bad at the end of the call.",1405845925

Workers can still eat for 12rmb (us$2) a day, or 20 if they want vegetables and some pork. The water and power supplies are still reliable, and the governments in China are investing in infrastructure to keep them so. Construction and its flow on industries is what&#x27;s keeping a large chunk of Chinese workers employed. Whereas there&#x27;s problems with the luxury property market and other high end industries, the Chinese are carefully watching their social bottom line, such as ensuring cheap food and water for workers. There&#x27;s still a long way to go in health care, education, and clean air though.",1405845182

8059886,comment,8054571,8055368,1,0,socrates1024,,,"We designed Permacoin with the goal of being rigorously secure. Our design addressed a bunch of problems that aren&#x27;t (yet) addressed by filecoin.<p>- Erasure coding (over the whole dataset) guarantees that you can&#x27;t just drop some of the filed and make them unrecoverable.<p>- Preprocessing the entire dataset to be full entropy guarantees that it isn&#x27;t cheaper to store one portion of the dataset than another (for example a segment with just all zeroes).<p>- Outsource resistance: it would be a shame if someone just runs a cloud service to store the file, which would be more efficient than using local hard drives. Arguably this is already happening with Bitcoin cloud mining. Permacoin and the follow up work on nonoutsourceable puzzles address this.<p>Without these features, the concern is that selfish miners might find ways to earn more filecoins without actually providing the useful service. Incentives are correctly aligned only when there&#x27;s no way to game or cheat the system.<p>Filecoin provides a richer interface (get and put for individual files) than Permacoin (which only guarantees recovery of the whole dataset at once). We would have supported this interface if we could figure out how to, while maintaining the same standard security properties! This is difficult (but hopefully possible) future work.<p>On the other hand:<p>- Maybe it will be a long time before practical ways to game filecoin catch on.<p>- if filecoin builds a community that values altruistic participation like Tor (and even Bitcoin to some degree) it will be useful anyway<p>- it could be possible to improve filecoin with features from Permacoin<p>- there&#x27;s a lot to learn from the actual launch of a system like this with real users",1405844992

8059882,comment,8059663,8059663,1,0,Todd,,,"Product Manager or Program Manager, depending on the org, probably makes the most sense. There is a lot of overlap with marketing. I see people go into that role from the development side from time to time--people who don&#x27;t really enjoy coding or have grown tired of doing it as a job. More often, though, they come from disparate backgrounds.<p>If you emphasize your strengths on the customer side, and develop your capabilities on the product side, I think you&#x27;ll be in good shape. It might take a while, and concerted effort, but most good things in life do. It sounds like the PM role puts you right where you want to be.<p>Study the lean startup materials (Eric Ries and Steve Blank). Learn about different agile methodologies, like Kanban (but don&#x27;t become a zealot). Learn about continuous integration, configuration management, and get your feet wet using issue trackers and source code management environments (Github, Bitbucket). You don&#x27;t have to get into the details, but at least understand how they work and what the state of the art is.<p>With your background, I&#x27;m sure you can find a role that would allow you to transition. It might not be right away. Just be clear about what you can bring to a position now, and where you would like to go in the future. If you&#x27;re working with a good company, or good management, they will try to make it happen to the degree possible.",1405844807

Yes, it&#x27;s understandable having reservations about Python being the tool of choice for such an init system, and perhaps C would be a better choice allowing more fine-grained control and guarantees.

The practice always intrigued me, and seemed very low-tech compared to some of the other stuff in the domain.

One of the detectors had a critical flaw, IIRC the output voltage of the detector modules was proportional to the number of particles passing through it. At every readout, it was reset to 0. Now, if you didn&#x27;t read out the modules often enough (every few seconds), they would fry themselves. The problem wasn&#x27;t noticed until the readout system crashed and a couple of modules were destroyed.<p>When the bug was presented in a meeting, there was one guy who insisted that we install a big red button to shutdown the system. There was even discussion on whether it should have a little lid or not. When that guy left the meeting early, they briefly considered to install a fake button.<p>In the end, what happened is that they built a &quot;heartbeat&quot; system that just zeros out the modules every second or so. The information in the modules is lost, but since there are millions of collisions each second, this had virtually no impact on data taking.

Obviously not a big deal, but it seems emblematic of how sloppy this piece is. The article confuses – seemingly willfully, since Paul Vixie should know better – the concepts of dynamic language, dynamic page generation, lack of proper input hygiene, and various other orthogonal issues. The argument that dynamic languages are less secure depends an awful lot on the language – I don&#x27;t think anyone is going to buy that C is more secure than Python. Haskell vs Python? Now that&#x27;s a debate to be had. Certainly, websites that do no dynamic content generation are probably more secure – but then you&#x27;re stuck with the Internet circa 1993.

I gave up and did it in Fortran (working with matrices is SO easy!).  Now, however, I&#x27;ve matured a little and realized that I really needed to get back into C++ and seriously use it.

In my experience, using `docker start` isn&#x27;t a best practice and I design my containers in a way that I won&#x27;t need to restart a stopped container.<p>If you use Docker containers as a form of lightweight immutable infrastructure you won&#x27;t care about zombie processes because you won&#x27;t be restarting stopped containers. Instead you just `docker run` every time you want to run a new container. The example of a corrupt file is moot because your containers shouldn&#x27;t be writing to the file system with the intention of that file being around for long. This also applies to databases, which I&#x27;m not fond of running in containers at all (setting aside highly distributed databases, perhaps).",1421768725

In annealing, you heat the metal up almost to the point where it loses its shape, then let it cool slowly. In the atomic picture, this chunk of metal has knots of stress and tiny mis-aligned crystals, but if we let the atoms jiggle, the knots can just work themselves out and the crystals can grow, because atoms want to align with their neighbors. It works the other way too though: If atoms jitter randomly then at any time they can exhibit a chaotic state, so if you suddenly stop that jitter (&quot;lowering the temperature too fast&quot;), then you just get a random state. So there is a sweet spot. You want just enough jitter to undo knots, but not so much jitter that you create new ones. By slowly reducing the temperature, you get to pass some special points where the neighbors have about the same impact on the crystal as the jitter, and as you slowly pass that, the jitter starts undoing the knots for you and then growing the crystals for you. You still often don&#x27;t get perfection, but you can get closer.<p>What does this have to do with optimization? Physicists like to think of this &quot;aligning with neighbors&quot; process as minimizing some &quot;interaction energy&quot;. But you can minimize whatever function you want with the same approach: (1) take any state you want, (2) let it randomly jitter to neighboring states, (3) accept the new states when it makes your function smaller, but also (with some probability p) when it makes your function larger, and (4) slowly lower p as you allow the system to randomly jitter around.<p>You can also get a good idea of what&#x27;s going on with a graph:<p><pre><code>    \   _b    / _
     \_/ \   /  _|-- B
          \_/   _|-- A
</code></pre>
Let&#x27;s explain simulated annealing by looking that the barrier above (b), which has two different energy costs to jumping over it: B from the left and A + B from the right.<p>Here we understand the jitter as having a typical energy E which lets it jump up the graph, but it still tends to fall in the holes. When E > A + B then it will jump from the deeper valley on the right into the left and back. But as we get into the range B < E < A + B, then it&#x27;s possible to jump from left to right, but not easily from right to left. The more we allow the system to jitter in this region as we slowly reduce E, the more likely the state ends up on the right somewhere, and then from that point on the algorithm mirrors your normal gradient descent algorithm.",1421768538

I usually am, and I do - you seem to be misunderstanding the use of the word &quot;shotgun&quot; when accompanied by all the other words.  The idea is to start in lots of places, randomly chosen, well spread, and then start climbing from all of them.  As you do so you gain velocity - perhaps better thought of as minimising an error rather than maximising a fitness or &quot;profit&quot; function.  As you drop down the surface you gain speed, changing direction according to a random sampling of the local gradients.  Keep doing this and you tend to climb out of the well again, but if you then bleed off the energy you end up stuck in a deep well.<p>Cross-comparing the behaviours of the different starting points lets you think globally about some of the structure, but that usually only helps if it&#x27;s <i>got</i> global structure.  Usually it&#x27;s better just to start with lots of points and look at the distribution of error of where they end up.<p>* Shotgun - start in lots of places and run simultaneously<p>* Ballistic - have your location include a velocity that changes as you move over the surface<p>* Stochastic - don&#x27;t try to analyse your local surroundings deterministically - with 100s or thousands of dimensions you can&#x27;t, so you sample projections of the local gradients.<p>* Hill-climbing - or hill descending, if you think of it as minimising error.<p>In general, I find it faster than either of SA or GA.",1421768089

Don&#x27;t just look at the people who you perceive are moving forward, look at the ones that appear to be standing still, and what do you think is the difference?.  Sure there are those that have moved forward due to being able to dramatize with success the superficial things and say/wear/do/hangoutwith all the right things and trick higher ups into believing they have more real authentic capability than they actual do, but that only lasts so long.  Where you really move forward is in your authenticity.  If you authentically love what you do, and you excel at it, and you look forward to advancing it forward no matter where you work or what you&#x27;re paid, then you&#x27;re pretty much invincible.  You will naturally exude passion for your chosen skillsets, you will embrace all that is thrown at you with gusto, and people will naturally gravitate towards that.  Most of all, pay it forward.  Mentor those around you in the same skillset area, and make a difference and demonstrate that even though you are an expert and SR level in your field, that the success of the team is rooted in the power of everyone being able to produce at the same level as you.    When you do that, whether you are intentionally trying to impress your superiors or not, it won&#x27;t matter, they will notice, and if they don&#x27;t, then you have some choices to make.  In field of dreams, the phrase, &quot;if you build it they will come&quot;, applies to you as a person, if you become the highly skilled, sr level expert, that exudes passion and innovative mindsets, people will come, they will gravitate towards it and you will be successful.  Maybe not as fast as those just phoning it in and playing the parts really well, but slow and steady always wins the race.  I work in a highly competitive environment and I am not even a full time staff, yet because I practice what I just preached, whenever a PM needs dev work done, my name usually comes up very early in the conversation.  That wasn&#x27;t a calculated thing on my part, I didn&#x27;t play a game, I didn&#x27;t coax anyone my direction, I just work really hard because I love being a developer, I constantly evolve and advance my skills because I feel empowered when I build more advanced things with code, and my authenticity and passion is obvious and authentic and people with good intentions will always appreciate that and gravitate towards it.  Now does this work EVERYWHERE?  Hell no, but its up to you to decide what works for you in terms of where you work, and don&#x27;t compromise your authenticity just to move up or make more, its not worth it in the end.",1421767729

I am able to hook it to most app servers (python,rails,etc) as well as rsyslogd . logging is a big pain on Docker, and you should think of your logging strategy before the pid 1. How are you rotating your logs and is your pid 1 restarting your app on failure? For us, supervisord does all that.<p>We run syslog and logrotate inside the container (using a volume) and it works fairly well for us. Plus supervisord comes with a pretty kickass tool - supervisorctl - and the conf file is fairly well documented.<p>Optimizing the RAM/CPU usage of supervisors and rsyslogd is not very critical - it doesn&#x27;t use too much.<p>I actually learned a lot from baseimage - but dont know why they went with runit rather than supervisord.<p>Would really,really,REALLY love to learn to do thus with systemd.<p>EDIT: ahh.. forgot that their script was based on runit.

The problem was already solved in the pre-Internet world: letterhead, signatures and postal mail.<p>Trustworthy commercial entities could really distribute their certificates in paper form (or maybe on a business card) as an official document.

For example, you may think that you want to be &quot;good&quot;. If so, you should first start by defining &quot;What does it mean to be &#x27;good&#x27;?&quot;.<p>The danger of skipping this process of thinking for yourself is that you may spend many years in a direction that you may ultimately feel dissatisfied with. That&#x27;s how conditioning works : parents, teachers, and society teach you what is &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; and you basically choose the red pill or blue pill without realizing that there could be pills of many other colours (or that you could swallow BOTH the red and blue pills and go, &quot;Hmm..that&#x27;s interesting...&quot;, as one cartoon based on &quot;The Matrix&quot; shows! :-) )<p>There are several alternative directions that your thoughts could flow in once you start this introspection. Just as an example : by society, you probably mean, &quot;the society of humans&quot;. Why are humans the only society to be helped?

You can see how each country is trying to further its own position and interest. Looking at this version of the document, it is impossible to see how a compromise will be reached since there are so many areas that are at complete opposite viewpoints - but you know that in a few weeks time an agreement will be announced as one side or another gives way (guess which!), and the public are nonethewiser.<p>Some are really good at watering things down, eg.<p>> The Parties shall endeavour to [US/SG propose: cooperate] [US oppose: establish a framework for cooperation] among their respective patent offices to facilitate<p>You can see already that they don&#x27;t intend to cooperate. Establishing a framework? what the hell does that even mean ..<p>You can now see that Australia, Singapore and Mexico are on Team USA when it comes to copyright terms (Australia opposed it during the FTA negotiations), everybody else opposes, but they will eventually have to come around on this:<p>> [NZ/BN/MY/VN/CA/JP propose; US/AU/SG/MX oppose: The term of protection of a work, performance or phonogram shall be determined according to each Party&#x27;s domestic law and the international agreements to which each Party is a party.]<p>[0] Here is USA - Australia: <a href=""http://www.ustr.gov/trade-agreements/free-trade-agreements/australian-fta/final-text"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ustr.gov/trade-agreements/free-trade-agreements/a...</a><p>Here is NAFTA - <a href=""https://www.nafta-sec-alena.org/Default.aspx?tabid=97&language=en-US"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.nafta-sec-alena.org/Default.aspx?tabid=97&langua...</a><p>[1] It might not be interesting because we have seen a lot of this in completed deals previously, but it is very important. The USA enforces its business interest laws such as patent and copyright terms onto recipients of &quot;free trade&quot; agreements, in exchange for getting access to the non-protected part of their domestic market.

I, for example, would make the assumption that the marginal value produced by a Basic Job worker in an hour would be close to 0, while administrative costs are underestimated by an order of magnitude. Now, it might be fun to try these out when I get home, but I don&#x27;t think I can get any significant insight from it.<p>And if you were to refine the model, it would then become too complicated to discuss in ways that could be comprehended by most people - too much effort and they&#x27;ll stop listening.<p>Moreover, it fails to account for larger benefits to society, which cannot be measured in the way such a simulation works. For this one we could seem crime dropping (happier society, prison costs diminishing, etc.), global health indicators improving (thus preventing tremendous cost), etc.",1384354295

In English the phrase &#x27;proper noun&#x27; does not mean I was implying the word puritanical was a noun, it means I was saying it is not a name (which we capitalize and call proper nouns), and therefore I was using it as an adjective. I hope that clears up your confusion.<p>As for the &quot;addict gene&quot;, again, this was supposed to be a synonym phrase for a notion of hereditary weakness, I was not implying it has a genetic basis or that genetics was known before Crick. The phrase &quot;addict gene&quot; was quoted because I have heard it in Sweden (in modern times) when discussing these issues.<p>I&#x27;m hardly an expert on Swedish history, just a person who asks questions when I travel. What I know of Swedish history could be written on the back of a postage stamp.

From almost any perspective <i>other</i> than security/anonymity, forcing a client to make a TCP connection to a publisher&#x27;s computers every time the client wants to read one of the publisher&#x27;s documents* is a <i>terrible</i> decision: stark, screaming madness. If transparent forward proxying breaks things with HTTP then that&#x27;s a problem with HTTP. Even from a security/anonymity point of view, an end-to-end connection is no panacea either: if encrypted it (hopefully) prevents third parties from seeing the content of the data sent, but it also makes damned sure that the publisher gets the client&#x27;s IP address every time the client GETs a webpage, and as recent events have illustrated publisher endpoints aren&#x27;t super-trustworthy either.<p>* Unless the client itself has an older copy which it knows hasn&#x27;t expired; but a single client is much more unlikely to happen to have one of those than is a proxy which handles requests from many clients, and probably has more storage space to devote to caching too.",1384353388

You have to understand what kinds of people these are (in general). They&#x27;re part of powerful political families, spoiled rich kids with entitlement issues that would make all US congresscritters volunteer for public apologies. They don&#x27;t agree on anything, least of all human rights (note that the UN human rights council is dominated by governments that don&#x27;t respect human rights. Which is why the only government to get dinged on human rights is the one government that actually attempts to respect human rights in the region). They will go to war if they saw any of their members threatened with so much as a citation. So no they can not be tried for war crimes.<p>They will, however, attack others every now and then.<p>So international law, and human rights, effectively don&#x27;t exist. So of course since this is just used as a political tool, it can be cheated with when convenient. That&#x27;s why they went so ridiculously hard after Serbia and let (for example) North Sudan/Egypt/Saudi Arabia/... continue their crimes without a peep.<p>Even when they do have money, it only works when enforcement works. So in order to get a conviction you need :\n1) the political interests need to be aligned\n2) some military needs to kidnap the sacrimonial lamb* and this can&#x27;t lead to an incident\n3) the lamb can&#x27;t have any good political structure left to support him<p>That&#x27;s all international law is. Look at the money behind it and you will understand how it works. Attempt to analyse it legally and it will remain a mystery. Look at the conflict between Russia and Saudi Arabia and you will see why they intervened 10 years after the Yuguslav wars, and why they only convicted Serbians, and take note that in this &quot;genocide&quot; of civilians, first only young males, armed, were killed. The whole thing was precipated by an attack by said &quot;victims&quot;, which was obviously part by an attempt at territorial conquest by said victims, and more than a few of the perpetrators died. Another army tried to intervene and couldn&#x27;t because it suddenly found itself under attack by the &quot;victims&quot; and the commander decided to withdraw (it&#x27;s not that they couldn&#x27;t intervene, they didn&#x27;t after finding themselves under attack by the victims). Both America and Europe took the side of the &quot;victims&quot;. Understand why that last part happened, who was on whose side, and you&#x27;ll see where the convictions come from, and just who and what the ICJ is working for.<p>Note that I&#x27;m not making the case that all governments are corrupt (beyond a certain degree). Just that a toothless, powerless, jurisdiction-less, &quot;court&quot; 100% dependant upon foreign interests cannot have a shred of integrity in practice.<p>But of course, don&#x27;t let reality stop you from feeling entitled, and in the US, and some parts of Europe, you can actually more-or-less enjoy these rights (keep in mind that in the EU, due to WWII, you don&#x27;t have full freedom of political opinion. If you think human rights will save you from conviction if you do something that&#x27;s technically a human right but flies in the face of this policy, don&#x27;t expect human rights arguments to save you from conviction. In Europe freedom of ideology does not apply nazism and a few forms of communism/socialism). If you actually wish to test human rights policies though ...

Given a model, everyone involved in a discussion can agree that either the conclusions of the model are correct, or one of the assumptions going into the model must be false. This is very important when disagreement is reached - disagreement in the conclusions implies disagreement with some assumption, so it makes sense to figure out which assumption is the cause of disagreement.<p>Its also important not to be blinded by a model.

Worrying is badly executed caring about yourself, and it&#x27;s better that than to not care at all. Don&#x27;t beat yourself up about it. You&#x27;ve already decided you want to change, don&#x27;t beat yourself up about needing time to do that.<p>- Life will go on with or without you feeling okay about it. Every moment you spend thinking about some way you want the world to be different is a moment you didn&#x27;t spend doing whatever it is you want to do with your life. Your life is your own, and whether it feels like it or not, you are choosing to worry, and you can choose not to. There are a great many things you cannot change in this world, and it&#x27;s unfair to yourself to worry about them. You CAN change your thoughts and behaviors, so change them to however you think a great person would think and behave.

In my view, it&#x27;s great from mathematical perspective, but it has its problems.<p>Monads sort of force you to make plumbing visible, and it&#x27;s not so neat as a result. For example, consider a big program that has two modules. The module A calls module B to do something. Now later, you want to add logging to the application. In normal languages, you can just call logging functions (which do IO), from within module B; module A doesn&#x27;t have to know a thing. In Haskell though, you have to wire the IO monad (or some other monad that does the logging and encompasses it) all the way from A to B. Or say, you want now to access database from module B. Again, you have to wire your DB access up from A, because that&#x27;s where the entry point is.<p>In normal languages, plumbing like log access, configuration, DB access can be accessed from any place via global variables or singletons, without imposing a dependency on the main module (or other modules). In Haskell, it&#x27;s like a military installation - every interaction with outside world has to go through main gate. I am not really sure if there is any benefit to it, but there is certainly a downside that the plumbing is becoming visible in Haskell.<p>If there would be way to declare something as &quot;plumbing&quot; and have it always available (but still explicitly declared as part of function signature), without having to pass it along everywhere, it would be great compromise, I think. It could even make the programs more type safe, because instead of passing RWS or IO monad everywhere, you could make functions dependent on just DB monad for database access, for instance.<p>Or you could then configure the plumbing for specific modules, something like dependency injection.<p>Maybe I am missing something, but I tried to find some articles about how to write large scale programs in Haskell, but no one really seems to explain this.",1384352078

But it has managed to get the job done, largely because people can still be expected to pay debts in full. This expectation largely holds because the system is set up so that paying in full is by far the most attractive option.<p>The thing about your system is that under it, paying debts in full doesn&#x27;t make any sense. You could just hold out for a settlement, pay far less than what you&#x27;d borrowed at that time, and leave the creditor holding the bag for the rest. When paying in full doesn&#x27;t make any sense, lending doesn&#x27;t make any sense either. When lending doesn&#x27;t make any sense, then a system of money based on debt is doomed to collapse.<p>One possible way to mitigate this is to set it up so that the debtor earns the legal right to first refusal when, over the lifetime of the debt to date, an amount of money equal to the original principal (or maybe the principal plus some multiple of the APR) has been paid into it.

And most people complaining just don&#x27;t try to (ehem) go with it: once you are used to seeing your code neatly formatted automagically, always exactly the same, you start to see how neat it is.

And the list that they can pick from was also selected, no?<p>I think if you need a team of 10 and you have 30 possibly good candidates within your company (and they are all available to move to your team).. sure, why not.

There are a lot of ways one can address their mental health issues--with the assistance of a trained, professional psychiatric counselor--that do not involve drugs.<p>Years ago, I had some anxiety issues that I needed help to get through. But it took my sister convincing me that drugs weren&#x27;t even the most likely result before I went to see a counselor. My issues weren&#x27;t serious (night-time, work-stress-related panic attacks), but they were becoming disruptive to my life and I feared getting drugged to numbness like half of my coworkers.<p>My counselor did not even bring drugs up, actually told me to quit my job. I did, and though the next job had even more demanding bosses, I had the perspective necessary this time to not allow me to stress about it quite so much.<p>There is nothing that can hurt you about going to see a counselor or therapist once. Most health insurance companies have very discrete phone lines you can call to find a mental health professional. The therapist will talk with you and discuss what <i>you</i> want to do. That&#x27;s really all they are there for. Most of them are capable of meeting at pretty much any time of day. If you don&#x27;t have health insurance, there are a lot of therapists that do pro bono work over video conference. You won&#x27;t get drugs forced on you if you don&#x27;t want them.

168185,comment,167255,167255,0,0,kingnothing,,,"Losing weight is as simple as eating less and doing anaerobic exercise for up to an hour a day, 3 to 4 days a week. If you're lifting hard, then the only variable is your diet. Drop a couple hundred calories off of your intake every day for a week - if you aren't losing 1 - 2 pounds per week, take another couple hundred calories off. I would say, in general, no man should eat less than 1800 calories per day, however. If you are, and not losing weight, you should most definitely see your doctor.<p>Aerobic exercise is great, but you shouldn't do it to lose weight. Do it for the benefits to the cardiovascular system. Anaerobic exercise will add muscle mass which in turn increases your metabolism. Also, by strenuously using your muscles every week, your body has to continuously repair them.<p>That is important because our bodies are designed for survival. What I mean is that when forced to lose weight, your body will first burn whatever muscle it doesn't need, then resort to the fat. It takes less effort for your body to break down muscle than fat, so it does so first. Your body puts a priority on repairing itself, so it's going to be forced to not burn the muscles it is repairing and instead break down fat for the energy it needs because you're eating less than you need to maintain your weight.<p>If you want a good weight lifting routine, check out www.wannabebig.com.

168181,comment,167255,167312,0,0,kingkongrevenge,,,"> I advocate focusing on the basic lifts<p>For the average dude just trying to stay in shape, nothing beats the full olympic lifts.  Take the barbell from the ground to over your head with snatches and cleans.  Do it right and you'll be stronger than 90% of the people in the gym from 10 minutes three times a week.<p>FYI:\nThe kind of lifts you see most people do in a gym are derived from body building routines, not proper strength training for athletic purposes.  Such lifts will puff up muscles through sarcoplasmic hypertrophy.  These slow movement high volume exercises actually decrease peak force, and puffed up muscles will slow you down and decrease aerobic efficiency.  Hence the terms ""blown-up"" or ""puffed-up"" fighter.",1208645155
168180,comment,167255,168172,0,0,kingnothing,,,"I'm not going to say you haven't lost eight pounds in three days, but I will say that most of that was water weight and the rest was probably muscle.<p>A pound of fat is roughly 3500 calories. In order to lose eight pounds of fat in three days, you would have had to induce a caloric deficit of over 9000 calories per day.<p>A note to everyone: The most weight you can healthily lose is about two pounds per week. More than that and you're going to start losing a measurable amount of muscle mass. The exception is when you first start out exercising and eating properly, but that should only last for a couple of weeks.",1208645092

Slow twitch exercise like distance running and cycling causes your body to shed weight in excess of calories metabolized.  Your body says ""Hey, I seem to be carrying this extra weight around long distances.  Better get rid of it as an efficiency measure.""",1208644352

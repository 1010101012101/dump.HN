2012017,comment,2011922,2011922,0,0,blaisco,,,"Autoscaling Heroku workers is definitely a problem that people would like solved, but I see a few issues with trying to offer the solution as a SaaS. One, you're targeting developers. There are several github repos that do this kind of thing for free, and developers would know how to find and implement those. Two, those github repo's are going to do a better job of scaling because they can turn dynos/workers on and off instantly (e.g. as soon as a delayed job is done); much more cost effective than waiting up to 5 minutes to turn dynos/workers on/off. Three, you're targeting people that are trying to save money and _don't_ want to spend money.<p>As an aside, perhaps I (a cheap developer) am not in your target demographic, and you're really targeting folks with lots of Heroku apps and lots of money to spend. In which case you should be charging bundles more than $20/month.",1292507972

In the new model, your photos are on Facebook, your emails are on Gmail, your tweets are on Twitter, your bookmarks are on Delicious, your data is on Dropbox, your music is on Spotify, your movies are on Netflix, etc... It's not centralised to one location, it's split up from one location (your computer) into potentially hundreds of locations owned by a variety of paymasters with different agendas. So, it is decentralised.<p>From the point of view of the collective, it's centralisation (data goes from many entities into a single entity) but from the point of view of the individual, it's decentralisation (data goes from a single entity to many entities).",1292507936

Although we use technology where it makes sense for us (Moodle, classroom projector computers, computer lab), but we are low-tech compared to our competition in the area. In my opinion, we provide a better education than they do, and we are definitely less expensive that the other top-tier private schools in the area.<p>My conclusion is that although technology can be very helpful, it is not the key to a good education.

2012000,comment,2010854,2010854,0,0,spacemanaki,,,"I just finished reading the all of <i>Hackers and Painters</i> after getting a cheap ebook from O Reilly. I wondered if there is any criticism of some of the economic theory ones? Specifically the one that follows this one in the book, <i>Mind the Gap</i>. (It says essentially that economic disparity isn't necessarily bad for society)<p>I don't have the background in economics or history to know if his examples are sound or not, but the part of me that tends towards more liberal values finds some of the arguments a bit repellent. Somehow, it seems to me that using the fact that ""in ancient Rome the price of slaves varied by a factor of 50 depending on their skills"" to help justify CEOs and baseball players high salaries is probably inherently flawed.<p>While reading it on the subway on my Android phone in epub format, the footnotes were broken, but I had hoped that the footnote attached this tidbit was some qualifying statement about why slavery isn't necessarily the best model to use when thinking about the worth of people today, but I was disappointed to find that the note was just more details on the economics of slavery and a reference, and seems to miss completely how flawed that line of thinking might be.<p>Is there anyone who is more economically educated who knows of some criticism of these essays? I know this probably sounds like someone who has had their beliefs questioned and wants to re-affirm them, and of course that's part of it. But I also remember reading the blog post ""Dabblers and Blowhards"" which picked apart PG's ideas about painting based on some (possibly) mistaken ideas about that history... so I'm suspicious.<p>Ultimately I would like to learn more about economic theory like this, so I'm looking for ""criticism"" in the sense of thoughtful discussions and response, not necessarily outright disagreement.<p>And thanks!",1292507693

2011991,comment,2011805,2011805,0,0,SimonPStevens,,,"My wife is a teacher so I speak with some 2nd hand experience here.<p>[tl;dr: 1) Innovation does happen, it just doesn't always involve technology or computers. 2) The system punishes those who innovate.]<p>Rant 1:<p>She is constantly innovating in her classroom. She is always looking for new and better ways to capture students attention and inspire them.<p>She is head of the department and is also innovating within her department. She works together with her team (currently 3 including herself) and often runs things like joint lessons so experience and best practises can be shared amongst the team.<p>However, she is not a techie so her innovations are in teaching styles, delivery, activities, content and management and not technology. I think sometimes as techies we can be quite arrogant in assuming that innovation must always involve technology.<p>Rant 2:<p>But the biggest problem in teaching is the system. The focus of the system is so heavily centred around grades that sometimes they forget we are dealing with children. The system encourages uninnovative parrot style education and memorisation of past papers so the pupils can reel off a bunch of model answers to keep the numbers looking good. So those who innovate are often rewarded with poorer grades because the exams focus on blind memorisation with no thought.<p>So much is expected of individual teachers that those who want to innovate don't have the time. She currently starts work at 7.45 when I drop her at school. She leaves at 5.30 when I collect her. She does an additional 2-3 hours most evenings and 3-6 hours on a Sunday. She works around 70% of the time in every halfterm/holiday break with the exception of the summer when we try to get a solid 2 weeks away somewhere. Add on the frequent parents evenings, open days and after school events.<p>The goal posts are frequently changed at both a governmental level, a local authority level and at an individual school level (sometimes conflicting). Deadlines are frequently imposed or changed with little or no warning. Unlike in my industry where if a request is made someone must choose to drop some existing work to fit it in, they are frequently expected to meet additional requirements without any reduction elsewhere.<p>She has been a teacher for 5 years and so far the syllabus in her subject has changed every single year. This means every year time is wasted re-writing schemes of work to fit a new syllabus, re-writing mock exams, re-writing resources and lesson plans. Some churn is obviously good to continuously improve, but when the required churn is so high there is no time to make improvements.<p>Lets add to this the constant pressure of demanding parents who see (or hear about) every innovation, and any that doesn't fit their own personal mantra for education they complain (and too much power is given to parents who complain). It's like having an additional 30 pairs of bosses per project each with their own totally different opinions on how their child should be educated (and they all seem to think they are experts and their children are angels).<p>Teaching breaks the spirit of even the most passionate rather than rewarding those who are innovating it crushes them under a mountain of work and unrealistic expectations.<p>It's the system that has to change first to reward the right kinds of behaviour. Every successive government seems to think they are the experts on education and their changes are forced through so quickly little time or consideration is given to implementation or if they will actually work.<p>[UK based btw]",1292507604

OTOH, it does seem like a lot of individuals in education are interested in the potential of e-learning (to give their institution a USP if nothing else), though I've been uninspired by a lot of the examples of it I've seen in practice.<p>One area which does see a lot of fashionable, Techcrunch-y startups is language learning - off the top of my head I can name Busuu, italki, and Voxswap which are language-learning social networks, ChinesePod and Skritter which are targeted at Mandarin learners, and Smart.fm and YC-funded Lingt which offer online flashcards. These, of course, are more aimed at individuals, suggesting that it's something much easier to target.<p>""Disrupting Education"" is an interesting read; the author's thesis is that e-learning is a 'disruptive innovation', that will first find success in niche areas where traditional education cannot reach (for example, providing high school students courses like Arabic, which are difficult to find teachers for). There it will gain momentum until it begins to displace more traditional education (though he holds that it will empower human teachers, not replace them).",1292507177

Surely, he did a lot of things that losers didn't but isn't he also a loser? This quickly grows absurd when you talk about competitive sports, but perhaps the line between winners and losers and what they do to become who they are is not as well-defined.<p>Framing everything in terms of winning and losing ends up producing cultural constructs that are by and large unsupportable with real-world evidence and experience. I know this probably sounds like sour grapes or one loser's whining, but reading between the lines of the original post it doesn't sound like author was particularly happy ""living"" that categorization himself.

When I started there I was expecting to be surrounded by the best and brightest on a mission.  I found that in the case of this company, in my group(say around 100-150 people) it was 5% of the people doing 95% of the work, surrounded by people content to do just enough to not get fired.<p>3) semi true, I do maintain contact with several people there.<p>4) Perks- NO NO NO NO NO NO!!!  Benefits at this place sucked.   After I left(2008) the company suspended raises for everyone for at least 18 months.  While I was able to change titles to a much higher ""paygrade"", the company did not want to ever make my salary reflect the title.<p>5) Probably the biggest reason I never want to work at a large company again.  Most managers were promoted beyond their competency, so decisions were made based on how much power they could wield and not what was best for the company.  A great example is how they would not allow certain blackberrys to connect to the enterprise server because one of the managers thought the scroll wheel was a toy.  iPhones were banned because it took > 1 hour to cut off your access if you were terminated.  Thats right folks, exchange/Phone policy dictated by the fact that the company thinks they will probably fire you and they cant cut off your access quickly enough.<p>6) true<p>7) Absolutely.

Both the education and the working processes have to undergo huge transformation/evolution (theoretically it should have started by education, but I can't see it happening). We still pretty much have been going to school more or less the same for the past 700 years. If we want to be in the 21st century, we must move on from the 13th.",1292504738

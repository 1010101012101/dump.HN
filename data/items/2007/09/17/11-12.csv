55634,comment,55371,55371,0,0,staunch,,,"This post seems like a pretty transparent attempt to justify his procrastination. It's a really easy trap to fall into. Actually releasing to the public is like selecting the ""Hurt Me Plenty"" option in Doom, it's not an easy thing to do.<p>My partner and I took turns emailing this quote to each other as a reminder to keep ourselves intellectually honest:<p><i>""Perhaps the most important reason to release early, though, is that it makes you work harder. When you're working on something that isn't released, problems are intriguing. In something that's out there, problems are alarming. There is a lot more urgency once you release. And I think that's precisely why people put it off. They know they'll have to work a lot harder once they do.""</i> -- Hardest Lessons #1\n",1190028892

I sent them a mail a few months ago to do so but didn't got any answer though. <p>I would now suggest to do the same for young people who had success in making their dream come true: startup, band, art, business, job, invention, science, etc. <p>The message should be: we are normal people, like you, we had a dream, tried it and it came true. They'll hit another gold vein because the emulation it provides is addicting. <p>Continue the good job. \n",1190028402

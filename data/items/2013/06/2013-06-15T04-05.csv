5884111,comment,5880596,5881316,3,0,B-Con,,,"There&#x27;s a general question among cryptographers: How far ahead of the general public is the NSA?<p>The answer: We don&#x27;t know. Interestingly, back in the early 90s they were maybe 15ish years ahead of us. Decisions they made back then weren&#x27;t understood until the 2000s. However, the gap may have been closed somewhat as of late. The public found flaws in SHA-1 (an algorithm by the NSA) in the 2000s that we believe the NSA didn&#x27;t actually know about yet.<p>A general note on cryptography security margins (not really an answer, sorry, just some thoughts): The margins are designed to take into account future advances in technology. The community chooses the problems with the most conservative, best understood parameters, and that seem to be the least-likely to experience a break-through. As well, it tends to pick things with margins like &quot;40+ years&quot;, meaning that even if we continue to improve our attacks and computing power at the same rate we have been, it is generally expected that it&#x27;ll take at least 40 years before we&#x27;re good enough to break it. (Obviously the experts turn out to be <i>wrong</i> sometimes.)<p>The community thinks very long term and tries to avoid ever picking anything that is very possible to be broken in just 20 years. It takes (in rough terms) at least 5 just to get through the review process and get the algorithm into standards, another 5 to get it into wide-spread usage, and another 5 to transition away from it. So a very popular crypto algorithm probably needs at least 15 years from its introduction run its life cycle, assuming theres no lull of happiness where it&#x27;s just existing as a secure, commonly used standard. So there&#x27;s little point in introducing any algorithm that is anything but a very low likelihood of being broken in 20, because it would spend only a fraction of it&#x27;s lifespan serving as a widely-used, secure standard.<p>Last point: Breaks tend to be slow, and big breaks are usually smelled very far in advance. When we&#x27;re 10 or so years out from a big break, we have a good chance of knowing it and we can start to transition away. Someone 20 years ahead of us may very well only find big breaks just before we start to migrate away from the algorithm.<p>Due to that, we might optimistically (optimism has no place in crypto, I know ;-)) think that an adversary 20 years ahead of us has relatively minimal advantage.",1371272339

This time the government openly acknowledged the mass collection of everyone&#x27;s phone records without probable cause, and continued media coverage has allowed it to build momentum. I think many people have been very upset about it for a long time, but everyone else seemed to show apathy so they did too, because if no one else seems upset, it&#x27;s hard to feel like anything can ever get done about it.

That&#x27;s a lot of balloons to cover rural Africa. It would help a great deal if the balloons could be made to stay in precise locations, like geostationary satellites. I thought maybe they had solved that problem (which would be amazing). But, I guess not. They said in the video that the balloons would follow the wind all the way around the Earth. Meaning, at any given time, the overwhelming majority of balloons are over the ocean. The difficulty, then, is not merely putting enough balloons up to cover the ground in 40km increments, but covering the ocean as well, in a solid band around the entire Earth. It&#x27;s not hard to imagine that a stupendous number of balloons would be required to provide any meaningful level of coverage.<p>I think this is more Google hubris than technical innovation.",1371271752

For every hour of work I do, I earn about $12 post-tax.  My income is y=12x.  $24k per year working a normal 40 hour week.  Okay.<p>Now let&#x27;s say I make the same wage but I get a guaranteed $20k tax-free.  For every hour I work, I earn $12 post-tax.  My income looks like y=12x+20000.  44k/year if I work a regular 40 hour week.  But I could also work only 20 hours a week and still make $32k/year, doubling my effective wages.  I could work 10 hours a week and bring in $26k/year.  Or work a single hour and make an effective hourly rate of $22,012 in that one hour.<p>People are absolutely smart enough to see how that works and many of them will choose not to work at all.  Yeah, it might be true that you don&#x27;t live anywhere near as fun of a lifestyle on $20k/year as $44k/year but that&#x27;s only if you value spending money.  There are plenty of people who would be content to contribute nothing TO society but still collect their checks FROM society.  That kind of asymmetry is worrisome to me.",1371270712

The latest change happened this week, where you can no longer have a profile picture on Youtube unless it comes from Google+. They actually removed my profile picture, and popped a message up saying I have to go to Google+ to set up the profile picture again. They replaced my avatar with a generic blue pattern that looks like crap. Bastards. I don&#x27;t want a Google+ profile.

Once you&#x27;re in that situation it&#x27;s advantageous to actually use that force. You wouldn&#x27;t try to shoot someone in a hard-to-hit area like their knee or shoulder because as you say, if you had the time or perceived the danger to be low enough to line up for a shot like that, you were probably not in a situation so extreme that would warrant use of deadly force. It would be legally more defensible to go all Mozambique drill on somebody on put two in the chest and one in the head.<p>However, given that you are in the situation where you must defend yourself, but where deadly force would not be allowed, proportional response is usually still the operative concept.<p>If someone comes at you with a bat and you manage to disarm them that doesn&#x27;t give you carte blanche in the U.S. to beat the attacker to within an inch of their life.",1371268850

Right-click on their page and select &quot;inspect element&quot;. Then in the developer tools window find the <body> element and click on that. The body {} selector should come up on the right hand pane of the developer tools window, click to the right of the last bracket } and it&#x27;ll let you add another rule, put in width:1000px; and then margin:auto; now go back and see the changes on the page. (refreshing the page will return it to normal btw). See. Much better.<p>There&#x27;s a reason why most websites use a fixed width. People complained about fixed widths in the early 2000s because they used to be only 800px wide and they weren&#x27;t used to the white bars on the side of their websites. Now that our monitors are about 1600 pixels wide fluid 100% widths are just too stretched out and it&#x27;s harder to read and scan through text.<p>You can also use CSS3 media querries to change the width according to window size (I made a site using this <a href=""http://timeforzen.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://timeforzen.com</a> (resize the window and watch the layout change))",1371268814

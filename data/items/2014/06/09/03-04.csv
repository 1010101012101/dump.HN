The most efficient way to use sunlight to do this is to turn all the energy we get from it into heat. But wait, thanks to the magic of black body absorption and emission the asphalt already does this. And since it&#x27;s black it absorbs most of the incoming light that strikes it transforming it to heat.<p>Yet this isn&#x27;t enough to melt the snow on the roads, because we have snow on the roads. So somehow replacing this nearly 100% efficient system with one that is about 15% efficient will solve our problems how exactly?<p>You are allowed to dream as much as you want, but when one of your main applications of what you&#x27;re touting as a solution breaks two out of three laws of thermodynamics you&#x27;re selling bullshit.",1402286387

These built-in extension types seem fairly encompassing now, but they don&#x27;t leave much room to expand to future ideas, unlike Android&#x27;s system.<p>Can any iOS developers clarify the situation?

7866939,comment,7866833,7866833,9,0,lobe,,,"For an attack on false information, they seem very light on the facts.<p>> False claim: We picked a really stupid place to put solar panels<p>They put forward several arguments as to why solar roads would be a good idea. The problem with this is that it does not address the opportunity cost - the argument should not be why solar roadways would be good, but why solar roadways would be better than solar rooftops or solar fields. The complete lack of figures here is not helping them.<p>> False Claim: Solar Roadways is going to cost $60 trillion dollars<p>OK, so it won&#x27;t cost $60 trillion, so what will it cost? Again, no numbers, no estimate, just &quot;we don&#x27;t think it will cost $60 trillion, but we can&#x27;t substantiate why&quot;<p>> False Claim: Asphalt roads are cheap and maintainable<p>Not going to argue the claim (whether it is true or not). But what research have you conducted into how Solar Roadways would be better, other than the (unsubstantiated) claims that the roads will pay for themselves.<p>> False Claim: we can&#x27;t afford to heat roads<p>They lead with &quot;&quot;Over 70 percent of the nations roads are located in snowy regions, which receive more than five inches (or 13 cm) average snowfall annually. Nearly 70 percent of the U.S. population lives in these snowy regions&quot;. Then follow up with &quot;Each year, 24 percent of weather-related vehicle crashes occur on snowy, slushy or icy pavement. Over 1,300 people are killed and more than 116,800 people are injured in vehicle crashes on snowy, slushy or icy pavement annually.&quot; Finally concluding with &quot;Does the current system of snow removal sound cheap to anyone? What would saving over 1300 lives and preventing over 115,000 injuries per year be worth? Not to mention medical bills, vehicle repair, lost wages, etc.&quot;<p>I am sorry, but that is not how it works. That is nearly implying that no one will ever die on a solar roadway. I agree that there may be benefits, but the article has used statistics in a way that is meaningless.<p>> False Claim: Glass is softer than asphalt<p>Where to start on this. Hardness is a horrible characteristic to choose a road surface for. Sure, glass may be harder, but will it be more durable? Cracks, structural weaknesses and fractures all will cause problems in glass if all you are worried about is hardness. It&#x27;s been a while since high school science, but I still remember this. Asphalt doesn&#x27;t need to be hard, as if it is scratched or compressed, there is just more road base beneath it.<p>There are many more problems with that article, but that should do for now. I am amazed that Solar Roadways would publish a rebuttal article in this style that is so light on the facts and that chooses claims selective to their cause (such as the hardness of glass). I feel sorry for those that have committed on Indiegogo if the calibre of the author is indicative of the calibre of the company.<p>Despite all of the above, I will give them credit for using &quot;Clearin&#x27; the freakin&#x27; air&quot; as a title for the article",1402286179

It&#x27;s confusing because of the inconsistent, often contradictory, incomplete, and sometimes just insane dictionaries provided by the various apps you access with AppleScript.<p>Switching to JavaScript will do exactly zero to fix that. However, there appears to be new functionality inherent in the implementation, including better integration of native code (oddly, the examples are in ObjC instead of Swift), and I assume this will be faster than AppleScript.

It might not be for you but it is frequently for me.  Ruby might be your first choice, and really that&#x27;s fine.<p>You&#x27;re not a lesser or better programmer than anyone else if you choose something besides Perl either.  Honestly, if you can solve the problems that you need to solve and you can work with your team, that&#x27;s the only thing that matters.  Not that you&#x27;re using some language that isn&#x27;t &quot;winning&quot;.<p>As for Perl not having support for recent things like Stripe, that&#x27;s just silly to argue (the author really should have searched the CPAN). Perl has many new modules, Dancer, Catalyst, Moose, Plack, Starman, Net::Stripe (maintained by me), and full support of AWS&#x27;s offerings.  And, yes modules written in 1999 do get used today, just look at all of LWP.<p>&quot;Winning&quot; isn&#x27;t everything.

I don&#x27;t have a hell of a lot of context because I don&#x27;t know what the exact initial claims were, but take this:<p>&quot;False Claim: we can&#x27;t afford to heat roads&quot;<p>Their response doesn&#x27;t actually talk about the feasibility of heating roads.  They don&#x27;t mention how much energy their solar panels will have stored before a snow storm, and whether or not it would be sufficient to melt lots of snow.<p>My half-assed guess is that there&#x27;s maybe enough energy in theory to melt an inch or two of snow, but they don&#x27;t really provide sufficient detail:<p>(From their website):<p>&quot;Currently, the full size hexagons are 36-watt solar panels, with 69-percent surface coverage by solar cells. This will become 52-watts when we cover the whole surface when we go into production. When we add piezoelectric, they&#x27;ll be capable of producing even more power. Also, as the efficiency of solar cells increase, more power will be converted.<p>We tested the heaters over the winter with a DC power supply that provided them with 72-watts. This was an overkill and made the surface warm to the touch on most winter days. We still need to experiment with different voltages at different temperatures, to determine the minimum amount of power required to keep the surface above freezing. Remember, they don&#x27;t have to heat up to 85 degrees like the defroster wire in the windows of your car: they only have to keep the surface warm enough to prevent snow/ice accumulation (35 degrees?).&quot;<p>You need what, like 300 Joules to melt a single gram of ice/snow/etc.  So their 50W panels could melt a gram of water per 6 seconds.<p>I can&#x27;t figure out how big the panels are, but their website seems to say 4 square feet.  So each 2&#x27;x2&#x27; square area (hexagon, whatever) can melt 0.166 grams of ice/snow/etc per second.<p>Say you get a hypothetical snowfall of 2&quot; (not very damn much for some areas).  That&#x27;s 4 ft * 2 in of snow, or 2/3 of a cubic foot.  That&#x27;s about 10 pounds of water in solid form, or 4.5k grams.  So assuming their 50W panels are 100% efficient at melting snow, it would take their accumulated energy about 8 hours to melt the snow.  (Of course please check my math, I might be off by an order of magnitude on either end here)<p>That seems at least theoretically possible, but there&#x27;s no discussion about how much energy a panel can store, or other factors that would weigh in here.  There&#x27;s no actual technical discussion whatsoever for that matter.  So I was kind of disappointed by the article.<p>Edit, sorry: &#x27;It would take their panels about 8 hours to accumulate the energy necessary to melt 2&quot; of snow&#x27;  (That&#x27;s at least somewhat in the realm of possibility, though for many areas 8 hours of direct sunlight during the winter ain&#x27;t happening, and a guarantee of a max of ~2&quot; of snow in a day also ain&#x27;t happening)",1402285751

It&#x27;s actually a beautiful language to work in in the same way English is a beautiful language -- it&#x27;s a beauty because it&#x27;s a goddamn mess. But it&#x27;s a rotten language to maintain.<p>Sure, it&#x27;s perfectly possible to write highly maintainable code (I have a few 30-40k line Perl projects that I can open up and get right to work on without too much fuss) and you can create some coding standards and stick to them, and write perfectly maintainable code. But Perl is a bit like C++ in the sense that everybody has different standards and those standards change and &quot;non-standard&quot; bits of the language start leaking into your code and you spend as much time unmessing things as you do writing code.<p>I don&#x27;t think Perl will ever really die, it&#x27;s too convenient, but it&#x27;s definitely never going to enjoy the dominance it once had. It&#x27;ll fall back to a very good one-off system admin and log processing language with some extra bits, but it&#x27;s simply a language that the rest of the world has surpassed and Perl 6 just isn&#x27;t a realistic offering, after a <i>very</i> loooong wait (nor does it fix the issues non-Perlers have with the language -- it&#x27;s basically fan service).",1402285439

As you get closer to diamond, you finally come to glass, which has a hardness of 5.5-6.0. So if anyone tries to tell you that glass is soft, just remind them that even simple window glass is harder than steel. By comparison, it&#x27;s asphalt that is soft.<p>Haha, this reply on that particular point is a joke. On the contrary you WANT asphalt to be soft, not hard on the road, because asphalt needs to be elastic. When a large truck goes on your road, you need the asphalt to show elasticity so that it can carry such weight and come back to its former state. Tensile strength and Ultimate tensile strength are the actual parameters you want to look it for such road materials and certainly not hardness.

I think we might have talked past each other with these past two comments.<p>I think you&#x27;re thinking that I&#x27;m saying something like &quot;well, if we&#x27;ve never made it to the moon, it sounds preposterous to think we ever will.&quot; It sounds like you think developing a politics-less way of funding scientific research is a matter of working on something to produce a new system. Please let me know if that is in fact your perspective.<p>It is not mine. To me, the idea of not having politics be involved in science sounds as absurd as... well lets assume we&#x27;re friends and imagine that you, I, and a mutual friend of ours planned to play lazor tag together. We go to pick her up and she says that she can&#x27;t join us because she has food poisoning and can&#x27;t come. As we are driving from her house to the lazor tag place, you say that biology shouldn&#x27;t interfere with plans with your friends. Now, you just mean that it sucks that she has food poisoning and you wish that this sort of thing didn&#x27;t happen occasionally. But your statement is slightly more absolute than that: biology, being fundamental to the human condition, is always involved in plans made among humans. Complex metabolic, biomechanical, and neurological processes are an inherent part of a lazor tag outing. I claim that politics is fundamental to the human condition.<p>I claim that much like food poisoning happens occasionally, so does pettiness and favoritism. That does not mean that it is pointless to keep one&#x27;s meats either freezing or cooked. That does not make it pointless to use separate cutting boards for meat and vegetables. Healthier biology is possible to achieve and so is healthier politics. But it is still politics.<p>My saying &quot;politics is always involved&quot; may now seem pedantic, so here is why it is meaningful and important: If you adopt an attitude that attempts to simply avoid politics, you will likely avoid studying and paying attention to politics and group dynamics. On a pragmatic level, this will serve you poorly. But on a more idealistic level, this will serve your cause poorly because you will abandon the opportunity to create healthy politics. What does healthy politics look like? That is a subject for whole essays and whole lifetimes of study, but I suspect you can recognize a social system with healthy politics by its high degree of trust.",1402283851

Can&#x27;t we do it both vertically and horizontally together?

In this case, the issue is that the market can remain irrational longer than someone at the bottom can remain solvent. Sure, in some sense you could say that people who don&#x27;t read their contracts and demand better terms deserve to be punished. But the market doesn&#x27;t just punish them, it punishes the people who try to negotiate for better terms. Who would hire a smart worker when a dumb worker can be tricked into doing the same job for less?<p>This is why we ban contracts involving slavery and indentured servitude. If they were allowed, 1/4 of the population would unwittingly walk into the trap-contracts. Even if they were perfectly rational, the next 1/4 would be forced to sign similar contracts by the fact that they had to compete with the irrational 1/4 on price (otherwise they starve). Regulations against this kind of thing don&#x27;t just protect people from themselves (which is arguably something government shouldn&#x27;t do), they protect rational workers from irrational workers. The market needs them to function (for any reasonable definition of &quot;function&quot;), and that makes them a good thing.",1402283195

The right to stop (and even introduce) any and every law through national votes keeps politicians nicely at bay. Large government projects need to be explained really well if people are to vote for it - yet they&#x27;re still possible as the gotthard base tunnel proves[1]. Even the banking secrecy has the effect of keeping governments humble when it comes to taxation - people will simply just pay what they think is fair. It comes down to the government being more like an employee rather than an employer - and the Swiss people would loose dearly if they had to give this up. The EU at this point would require a complete reboot to get such strong mechanisms of checks and balances - and I&#x27;m not convinced that the Swiss system couldn&#x27;t work for larger entities.<p>[1]<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gotthard_Base_Tunnel"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gotthard_Base_Tunnel</a>.",1402282847

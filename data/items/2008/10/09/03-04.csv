I know you are trying to go for the simplicity of Google, but flashy design seems pretty important for the space you are in.<p>Also your layout jumps to the left after you leave the homepage. So its kinda odd",1223524758

Are their LPs revolting?<p>If that's the case, then it means there is less cash to go around. If you're still a bad-ass startup, it still seems that your valuation would still be relatively the same at such an early stage, right?",1223524450
327458,comment,326719,326719,0,0,nickb,,,"Try doing few usability studies with client-side software (I'm really talking Windows apps) and you'll see how much pushback you'll get. Consumers just <i></i>hate<i></i> installing apps. They absolutely loathe it. Everyone seems to be afraid of viruses and software. Now, this can be overcome to a degree if you're a huge company and have a well-known brand name that people trust and you can also overcome it by targeting a specific segment of the market that are computer knowledgeable and are willing to trust you. I'm not sure but I think that Firefox addons have less push-back than regular apps (just a guess, have no data).<p>So in short, make sure you do several usability studies with people who fit your market segment.",1223524447

327456,comment,327259,327259,0,0,agotterer,,,"I'm a developer for a large e-commerce site. We require users to input their credit card for each purchase (no save functionality). We store the credit card for the duration of the transaction. Which is usually a few seconds. The time it takes to do run an AUTH ONLY. During these few seconds cards are stored with 256bit encryption on a server not accessible by a public IP. We use the mcrypt library in PHP.<p>I understand you want to save the cards for future purchases, but you should definitely give customers the option to input their card every time if they so desire. If you dont need the card in the future, theres no reason to save it. Most processing gateways will return a transaction id which you can use to take processing actions in the future. You can run voids, refunds or settle payment. For our site we settle payment once we ship the goods and its all done with transaction IDs. The only thing we hang on to is the last 4 digits of the card number as a reference.<p>If you are going to store the card numbers use a good, well known encryption algorithm. Hashing isnt encryption, plus a one way hash will not work since you wont be able to recover the number to process.<p>Its important you become PCI compliant, especially if you are selling a hosted solutions to other businesses.",1223524394

327453,comment,326903,327389,0,0,bokonist,,,"There are two differences.  One, gold is impossible to counterfeit.  The Fed can print more money, companies can dilute their stocks, Topps can introduce new lines of baseball cards, but short of building a particle collider, you can't make more gold.  The chance of a new discovery affecting the price of gold is rather slim.  The Earth is pretty well explored at this point.  The second difference is that gold is a natural Schelling Point (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schelling_point"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schelling_point</a>).  Society needs one object to serve as a store of value.  We call this object money.  Throughout the ages, this object has consistently been gold.  Currently, we are in a historically abnormal period where the store of value is a U.S. Federal Federal Reserve Note.  If it looks like the U.S. government is abusing this privilege by  diluting the currency, people start hedging back towards gold.  On the other hand, if someone like Paul Volcker starts running the show, faith in the dollar is restored, and the price of gold collapses.<p>So yeah, gold is like the ultimate baseball card.  But the emphasis is on the world ""ultimate"", and that makes all the difference.",1223524173

I'm so sick of how knowing how to solve these test-the-basics questions is supposed to determine whether a person will do a good job for the company.<p>This approach favors ambitious geeks who like to study tons of these problems before hand, and only mildly helps those who are really bright.<p>Rather, the author has it quite right.<p>""Talk about projects, see if the guy gets animated.  Combine that with some pre-submitted code samples, and you can get a genuine idea of how suited the candidate is.""<p>This favors candidates who are genuinely interested in the particular job. The best way to determine the aptitude of a candidate is to see how enthusiastic he/she is about providing solutions to basic problems the company faces.<p>With this, I'm of course not implying that your company should hire any random idiot, so spare me that.

327451,comment,327279,327376,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"You realize, I hope, that Sequoia cannot be accused of either being a ""bandwagon VC"" or not being profitable.<p>Sequoia is, by most measures one of the best, if not the best, VCs in the world, in terms of success and respect from peers and the companies they fund.<p>So, pick on the VC model all you like...but this is an article about something Sequoia has said that effects pretty much all of us.  If Sequoia-backed companies are being told to tighten their belts, then we'd all be smart to do the same.  Sequoia hasn't gotten to where they are by investing in companies that waste money...so the assumption that they're saying, ""Stop wasting money, as you've been doing lately."" probably isn't the right way to take this advice.  It should probably be taken as, ""I know you all run a tight ship, and you're doing the best you can to maximize returns without being wasteful, but now might be the time to focus on outlasting your competitors, rather than outgrowing them.""<p>The companies that survive will be the ones that will be best placed to become market leaders when the market begins to recover.

I'm not trying to argue for one or the other being altogether better; I think that's really context and user specific and as I've said before, I definitely think it's easier to build a business around web technologies.<p>To tie this back to the original topic:  great desktop hackers can throw together desktop apps quickly, and know the quirks for developing cross platform (just like great web hackers know browser quirks).

Wonder how they managed that if it's impossible.<p>People's attempt make this about a physical wall is absurd.  It's not about a wall.  It's about many measures.  Also, it is rather easy to prove that someone is an illegal alien.  Hey, Japan makes foreigners carry an alien registration card and if you can't produce one you might find yourself on a flight out of the country.

860131,comment,860049,860049,0,0,spudlyo,,,"I'm a MySQL DBA, I occasionally work on a database that hosts a few large Drupal sites.  While I disagree that Drupal simply sucks and that you'd be better off hacking your own homebrew CMS in rails, the author does make some valid points.<p>Drupal does indeed store logs in the database, in a table called 'watchdog'.  One problem I've run into is that if a popular page generates a bunch of warnings, there ends up being a pretty heavy write load on this table.  It doesn't help matters that it's usually a MyISAM table, which means that all these writes stack up when the table gets locked, say when Drupal wants to do prune old entries.  I've seen this nearly exhaust all the available MySQL threads.  I think there is a module that you can use to stop this behavior.  Alternately you can alter the table to use the BLACKHOLE engine.<p>One thing the author didn't mention, is that Drupal's content search is really bad.  In order to perform multiple keyword searches it ends up generating these massive queries that join tens of search index tables.  These queries can kill the MySQL join optimizer which can ultimately bring your MySQL server down.<p><a href=""http://drupal.org/node/514366"" rel=""nofollow"">http://drupal.org/node/514366</a><p>While this bug has been fixed, the search queries are still gnarly and slow.  If you're planning on running a Drupal site with a lot of content you'll definitely want to investigate an alternate search system, perhaps using something like Sphinx or Lucene.",1254668290
860130,comment,860047,860047,0,0,patio11,,,"This rationalization of essays is long in coming, because in truth the mythical status they're given is because they give students (and parents, and people selling services to parents) the impression that even in late junior year something can be done to significantly increase their chances of admission into the university of their choice.<p>This is, largely, bunk: essays are weighted extremely modestly relative to grades, test scores, and race.  For example, on the University of Michigan point system, where 100 points were needed for an admit, the difference between a 3.2 and 3.6 average was worth 8 points, the difference between a 21 and a 22 on the SAT was worth 4 points, the difference between black and white was worth 20 points, and the difference between the best essay they read every year and the worst was worth... 1 point.<p><a href=""http://www.umich.edu/~mrev/archives/1999/summer/chart.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.umich.edu/~mrev/archives/1999/summer/chart.htm</a><p>University of Michigan is distinguished from more selective universities more in that they had the misfortune to standardize and actually write down their admissions criteria rather than in having vastly different mixes than, e.g., MIT.",1254668255

Marriage between a man and a woman is ordained of God. Marriage between man and woman is essential to His Eternal Plan.  (Source: <a href=""http://www.lds.org/library/display/0,4945,161-1-11-1,00.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lds.org/library/display/0,4945,161-1-11-1,00.html</a>)<p>Now, that is my view, based on careful study and thoughtful inquiry and seeking after truth.  I recognize that others may not understand this the same way.  I value their individual perspectives and respect and love them still the same.<p>I also recognize that there is a difference between Eternal Marriage covenants and earthly contracts which have no sway in the eternities.<p>Therefore when it comes to the discussion of legal matters, we must look deeper into what benefits legal recognition of marriage has to society.  I put forth that civil marriage is based on the importance of gender as an aspect of ones identity and personal attributes and that a union between a man and a woman allows for great synergy and creates the appropriate corner stone for families- and the raising of children.  The synergy between male and female is essential to the benefit of marriage to society and the appropriate rearing of children.<p>I love and respect those who are attracted to the same sex, and I support their legal right to choose their own lifestyle.  However, I cannot support a change in the legal structure of the family to cater to their individual tastes and desires, nor can I personally condone action that is inconsistent with the commandments of the Almighty God of Israel.",1254668185

860103,comment,859770,859770,0,0,radu_floricica,,,"I'm living in Bucharest, Romania, and I can confirm this part. A few years ago I used to live in a somewhat less respectable part of the city (not a ghetto by any means, the communists made sure we don't have those, just closer to the periphery and poorer). For some reason it use to be a stop point in girl trafficking - lots of young girls worked at the corner of the street for a few weeks at a time. Many of them from Moldavia, and I presume going further west. At one time I was actually offered a woman for around $200.<p>A few points:<p>- Most girls were not slaves per se, kidnapped and hold by force. All, as far as I can tell, were driven to this by poverty, lack of any prospects in the village of birth or both.<p>- I am not against prostitution as a job, especially since I've seen it done successfully and with quite a bit of entrepreneurial spirit. But in some conditions it can be worst then anything you can imagine. I am especially suspicious of anything that looks organized. I'd guess this is a direct consequence of it being illegal - Amsterdam seems to have managed to make it both organized and civilized.<p>- I'd have liked to make some comments about corruption, politicians and the way things seem to be ""settling in"" in the last years, but it's all speculation so I'll abstain.",1254666816

Anybody capable of moving away from areas and cities with huge illegal immigration populations will move.  Once they are gone and the businesses move with them, what you have left is an area that consumes taxes at a high rate and contributes very little back.<p>Is it racism that causes people to move?  It could be, but there are valid reasons to flee such areas.  There are huge gang problems and schools start to under perform.  Hispanic students are some of the worst performing students in the country, often not even finishing high school.

860098,comment,859669,859669,0,0,MarkPNeyer,,,"For those interested, I thought I'd provide an 'insider's view' of bipolar, since I have it. I go through manic phases followed by depressive phases. Sometimes mine are short (i.e. hours) but intense. Other times they last for months. I am obsessed with the problem of P vs NP, and thinking about it too much can lead me into manic phases, where I become convinced that I've solved the problem, and that others (i.e. teachers and friends) are out to steal my ideas. I become paranoid and write my name and the date on everything I write, in case someone claims my notes as their own. I become convinced that I am the reincarnation of Godel, Turing, John Nash, or other mathematicians. I converse with my ""former selves"" and tell them about my ideas. They respond with fascination and sometimes suggestions of their own. My mind spins and reels, and it feels sometimes like it becomes completely detached from my body.<p>It's true that while I'm manic, I can get abnormal amounts of work done. I also speak incredibly quickly, and develop a stutter because my mind moves too fast for my mouth to keep up. I call them 'cache misses' because my brain has to stop and go back to where it was just seconds ago, in order to 'fill in' the missing words. Because I think so quickly while manic, I become frustrated and irritated with anyone and anything that stops me from thinking as quickly as I'd like to. I have trouble sleeping at night, and when I do sleep, I dream of absurd mathematical problems that don't make any sense. Once I was skiing with some friends, and I had a dream wherein each ski route was assigned an integer value. It was up to me to make sure that the sum of the slopes traversed by my group was exactly zero. I had to keep convincing people to do different slopes in order to keep things balanced. When I have those dreams, I have a hard time waking up because I want to solve the problem so badly that I can't get out of bed. Additionally, when I'm manic, I drive more recklessly and take risks that I shouldn't. I'm much more likely to go home from a bar with a girl that I shouldn't. It seems like my sex appeal dramatically increases while I'm manic. This could be because I'm just thinking more highly of myself in general, but it could also be because i'm more aggressive, bold, and confident, all of which are appealing to girls.<p>The flip side of the mania is depression. When a manic phase ends, it usually leads to a depressive phase, when I realize i'm not a super genius capable of anything, and that my conversations with past mathematical figures are hallucinations. I think of myself as hopelessly stupid and doomed to live an unhappy life. It's not just being sad. It's a state of total hopelessness and despair. The only thing in the world that is remotely appealing is killing myself, which I dream of constantly. I've attempted suicide three times, each time getting closer to actually finishing the act. The last time I tried, I was standing on the 28th floor of a building in downtown Seattle, trying to work up the courage to jump off the ledge. If it weren't for some people who happened to come up the elevator as I was sitting on the ledge, I probably wouldn't be typing this today. I know that suicide is a terribly selfish thing to do, but until you've experienced the despair and hopelessness associated with bipolar depression, you can't begin to understand how much it makes sense. After my second attempt, I was taken against my will to a mental hospital, where I spent a few days. It was the worst experience of my life. All it impressed upon me was that, if I ever feel like suicide again, I shouldn't tell any medical professionals because they might take me back there. Even when I'm perfectly happy and level(i.e. no longer in a depressive or manic phase) I still occasionally think about killing myself. When I hear a story in the news about a plane crash or a celebrity dying, my first thouhgt is always to be envious of them. Just writing this post is making me want to kill myself.<p>As if the hopelessness, despair, and suicidal idealization weren't bad enough, I lose my attention span, ability to focus, and ability to enjoy things. Activities that I once used to enjoy become boring. I don't enjoy hanging out with my friends as much, and I don't want to do anything but sleep. I try to read a book but I don't enjoy it. I try to watch some TV but it's boring. I try to play a video game, but it doesn't hold any appeal to me. I go to a park to take a walk in nature, but it's all boring and uninteresting.<p>Lately the past few months, I've been mostly good. I still live in fear of entering another depressive episode. I regularly visit a psychiatrist and therapist, and I take mood-stabilizing medication on a daily basis. If I go off of my medication, (I once went to visit my parents for two weeks, and left it at home) I become incredibly depressed. Alcohol, even in small amounts, can make me suicidal.<p>Am I hopeful about the future? It all depends upon when you ask me. Some days I feel like I've got the worst of it behind me, and as long as I follow my medications, avoid alcohol, stick to routines, and don't make drastic changes in my life, I'll be OK. Other days I realize that empirically, something like 20% of people with bipolar die of suicide, and your odds of dying of suicide increase dramatically if you've already attempted it. I really have no clue as to whether i'll die by natural means.",1254666542

860096,comment,859686,859832,0,0,natrius,,,"California (and New York, Texas, Illinois, Florida, etc) would be fine without subsidizing other states. In fact, they would probably be better off. When places become difficult to live in, people tend to move to better places. We spend money trying to make unproductive places viable places to live when that money would be used more efficiently in states with better infrastructure, both human and physical. The more people who move away from subsidized places, the more money they will make on average, and the more iPods will be sold.<p>Humans agglomerate because it makes us more productive. By subsidizing dying towns in the middle of nowhere (and Michigan), we're paying people to be less productive. I don't care where people choose to live, but I shouldn't have to pay for their choices.<p>Even if it were in the self-interest of productive places to subsidize non-productive places, our current method of doing so isn't the best approach. There are greater gains in productivity to be had for less money in Mexico, which would create wealthier neighbors for us to sell things to.

860074,comment,859468,859958,0,0,mr_luc,,,"I had two thoughts:<p>a) Changing 'schemas' is supported by document, or advanced key-value, stores like Couch or Cassandra. You end up thinking of your objects more as hashes and program accordingly; everything else is just a mapreduce task (ie, you've updated your schema. If you coded well, nothing should break because of that, but you'd like to update all of the old objects. So write a mapreduce task, like a migration, that does that).<p>b) DataMapper, for ruby, is used mostly as an ORM; however, the ""R"" is pretty optional, as people have written data adapters for other architectures -- from CouchDB to the SalesForce API.<p>Those are just some associated thoughts. I'm playing around with Cassandra and Couch on my server at the moment (grr, when I have a moment).",1254665640

And reading about others candidly talking about their hopes, frustrations, and <i>regrets</i> helps give a third-party but first-person perspective in life.

A great hobby is sometimes a sustainable source of happiness, and it's good to diversify. I'm pretty sure I'm a maker-type - that's what makes me happy.

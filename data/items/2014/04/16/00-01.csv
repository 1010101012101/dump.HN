7595308,comment,7594446,7594446,6,0,Theodores,,,"Regarding the co-founder problem, time for a music analogy...<p>As a student there is this idea that you should be in a band, making music. Getting there needs lots of brainstorming to come up with the songs, lots of practice, jamming sessions, rehearsals, going out to try and get gigs, musical collaborations, partnerships with DJ&#x27;s and support acts, getting gigs and publicising the gigs. Then there is the dream of getting signed by a record label.<p>The idea that you could do all of this on your own is quite laughable, isn&#x27;t it? Even solo artists usually have a producer or a song-writer that is in effect a &#x27;co-founder&#x27;.<p>Yet some get there on there own. Take for example Cliff Richard. The Shadows were his band but also mere hired hands with no equity. Cliff Richard didn&#x27;t even have to write songs, those could be acquired somewhere else much like how a developer can pick up frameworks and make them their own.<p>In music there is an understanding that an artist can be solo. Just because they are not in a band does not mean nobody believed in them. Record labels don&#x27;t tell them to go away and come back when they are in a band, if the talent is there then they will sort out whatever is needed, whether that be session musicians, songwriting or production.<p>This music analogy may appear a long way off software MVPs, however, it isn&#x27;t. Another thing to learn from the music industry is that people don&#x27;t expect a product (a song) to be number one on the hit parade for eternity. New shiny things on the web should be seen that way too, expected to be popular for a while in the &#x27;top 40&#x27; and then to &#x27;sell&#x27; consistently as back catalogue.",1397609371

To support the &quot;team collaboration&quot; story we knew it was going to be a heavily JS based &quot;native like&quot; UI experience.  So basically a rich single-page app that used push-state and web-sockets a lot.<p>Meteor is nice in that it folds a number of technologies into the stack that when combined are extremely powerful, not least of which being Mongo on the server AND the client, which helps a lot in reducing the amount of code you typically have to write for dealing with invalidating shared data when it changes between users.  It achieves this by having the Mongo API replicated on the client in JS, which is really a thin proxy to the DB on the server.  So your coding against Mongo as though it were actually in the browser, and Meteor handles the data syncing in the background.  It sounds a little magical, but it shakes out to be a really helpful abstraction to sit behind.<p>The real kicker for us, though, is that we can lean on the hard-core architectural work MeteorDG has done to ensure a real-time, web-sockets based system of this kind can scale readily when there are ton of connected clients.<p>By avoiding rolling that sort of architectural plumbing ourselves we&#x27;ve been able to focus more on the feature set.",1397609015

Programming a complex model is relatively simple, given decades of neurobiological research.  But running this brain, absent a physical embodiment or model simplifications, offers few lessons about the nature, structure, and form of intelligence.<p>The purpose of a brain is to control homeostasis, motor, and perception functionality.  Without a rich world simulation, the brain is just an isolated processor.  By modelling at the neuron level, the only inputs can be at the neuron level.  That means you have to physically model the entire mouse&#x27;s body to connect all the inputs.<p>Even if you had a realistic body simulation, you also need to run the system for an extended period of time.  Intelligence is an emergent behavior, and it needs time to work and learn.  Since you have to model every single neuron firing at the same time, the speed at which you can run this model is unreasonably slow.<p>I feel like approaches which slowly build a system of models, each of which simplifies the function of a particular neural region to something computationally tractable is the more realistic approach.  In doing so, you develop models which reveal the structure of intelligence.",1397608730

The existing behavior is very easy to rip off:  You write two transactions, the one paying yourself, one paying the merchant. Simultaneously you hand a big miner the first while handing every other node you can reach the second. It&#x27;s very likely that the first doesn&#x27;t propagate at all, but you&#x27;ll have a decent successrate at reversing.<p>Blockchain.info even had a handy tool before to author double spends but they&#x27;ve removed it.<p>In any case; there is some real subtly here. Both the case where miners are alturistic and don&#x27;t help doublespends even if bribed and where miners always just take the highest bidder are consistent models which can enable safe zero conf transactions. But the transaction styles you use to get safe zeroconf are very different, and inconsistent behavior in the network is basically pessimal.  There has been some debate in the past if the greedy behavior shouldn&#x27;t already be the default: most people believe that it will eventually be in that state, and so there is a tradeoff between setting the right expectations for the long term but requiring more advanced handling of zero-conf vs having the best security for the simplest possible ways of using Bitcoin.  I don&#x27;t think there is a clear answer to the tradeoff, but because the inconsistency is bad I think if non-trivial hashpower picks this up the network will need to change the default behavior.<p>(Since I expect someone will ask: To get safe-zero-conf in the greedy miner world, you have the party pay you (optionally with an additional security fee if they are really untrusted), and if you see them a doublespend you spend the entire payment to fees (so you&#x27;ll win the auction very likely). If they&#x27;ve provided any security at all their expectation is negative, if you make them provide enough security (E.g. security = tx value plus ε) then you can give them negative expectation without losing money yourself.)",1397607061

Haskell/Verilog 2001/SystemVerilog all give us tools to do this.  However, when trying to make real silicon, you need to understand what is actually getting built (i.e. know exactly how many flip flops you&#x27;re creating and how they fan out) and then use the language to describe it.   If you use a &#x27;for&#x27; loop to try to do computation, as you might in a programming language, you could end up with something entirely unexpected or unsynthesizable.<p>Traditionally you first design your module conceptually on a whiteboard (or Excel, Viso, etc.), then implement it in an HDL.  Because of the influx of software engineers trying to get into hardware (via FPGAs, etc.), there has been a trend in trying to obfuscate away the details of the implementation, and this can cause a lot of confusion.<p>That said, I&#x27;ve heard of projects that already translate native Haskell to HDL with some success.  I&#x27;m not a programmer so I don&#x27;t claim to understand if it&#x27;s a good idea, but I still think understanding exactly what&#x27;s being output is important to knowing if it can perform in a reasonable way, especially if you&#x27;re doing something of any complexity.",1397607018

Actual prices vary and with enough competition, will settle to something that gives the trader still a nice profit and enough cash to insure against the risk of such an operation (the trader doesn't know up-front when he can actually onload the goods and how far the price might move meanwhile).<p>Of course, if you're not desperate on selling right now and or the risk for the trader is too high (i.e. the minimum price you'll sell right now is higher than what the trader is willing to offer you right now), nothing happens.<p>Concluding, traders do add utility to a market.

Like any other software company, there are diminishing returns for features / revenue. When the product is slated for release on Xbox, PS3, and PC it is typically done with one codebase with platform specific code where necessary. You often end up with a common denominator where the PC people usually feel left out in the cold.I can attest that it takes a monumental amount of work to support the myriad graphics card configurations for the sole purpose of getting your game to look/feel ROUGHLY the same on all three platforms. To customize the game for one platform would be at the expense of the other two (from a development, production, and QA perspective) and it often doesn't make sense to those paying the bills.<p>Sometimes the PC gets a dedicated port (such as Mass Effect for the PC), and those things that make PC gamers smile get added. However, this port is essentially a new project (SKU in retail games parlance) that is greenlit only if the console versions of the game have sold well enough to warrant it, and is typically done by a third party under extreme time pressure.<p>All these factors contribute to less polish, which everyone involved is keenly aware of. Hopefully I've illustrated that this is a complex problem that can hardly be addressed by a ""it doesn't take that much more effort to do a good job"" platitude.",1312296842

I need to get enough of an advantage to be able to stay ahead of those with more web implementation experience.<p>However, one involves analysing the cross-connections between hundreds of users, and hundreds of small units of data they each have.  The naive algorithm is O(n^3 m^2) and is too slow for more than 30 users or 100 units of data.  The analysis showed that early, so the architecture of the system was changed to cause the data to ""flow"" around the system and agregate closer to where it was needed.<p>Another application uses proximity detection on potentially thousands of points.  Again, the naive algorithm worked for small numbers of users (I use the term loosely - they're more ""agents"" than users), and again, big-O analysis showed the critical points in the system.<p>I'm sure that most web development consists of gluing libraries together, stuffing databases, and populating forms or similar.

2837201,comment,2837067,2837067,3,0,Pewpewarrows,,,"> A common and frustrating use-case was mobile Twitter: Someone would share a new favorite or upload on Twitter, you tap on it, and it tried to load the regular site on your tiny smartphone screen. Pushing the whole desktop site over a mobile connection would be a waste of precious bandwidth, if you only want to check out a track. Alternatively we could try to redirect to our native apps, but there’s no guarantee that the user has it installed and the mobile vendors don’t offer any APIs for verifying that in advance.<p>Somewhat off-topic, but for any devs interested: Android allows you to do that. From your native app, you can essentially hook into whenever the user tries to open a URL that looks like your site (soundcloud.com, etc), and through the Intent system the OS will offer the user the option of opening that URL through your application. From there you can parse the URL, see what they were trying to look at, and dive deep into the app to whatever screen (Activity) makes sense for that content.<p>Here's an example from StackOverflow: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2448213/how-to-implement-my-very-own-uri-schema-on-android/2448531#2448531"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2448213/how-to-implement-...</a><p>I'm not as familiar with iOS, so I don't know if something similar exists for that environment.",1312294972

Eventually turned it into a funded start-up and now it is live.<p>Social Fortress provides consumers with unparalleled privacy online by integrating transparent client-side encryption transparently into major social networks, webmail service providers and desktop email clients. Consumers’ data is encrypted prior to leaving their device and stays that way until it reaches the device of trusted contacts where decryption is also done on client devices.<p>Social Fortress protects messages and photos using AES 256 CTR method with rolling keys. No two messages or photos are encrypted with the same key. Social Fortress maintains the central key management server as well as the consumers relationship and authorization trees.<p>All of the encryption and decryption is done in the background, directly inline, so the end user experience on his or her favorite online communication platform does not change. Messages are stored wherever they would normally should be except they are protected with AES encryption every step of the way. Photos are stored encrypted in a separate data center with no access to the key management infrastructure.<p>It takes less than a minute to get Social Fortress, and it installs as a single browser plugin for web apps or application plugin in the case of Outlook or Thunderbird. We just launched into an open beta and would appreciate your feedback.<p>If you have any questions that are not answered on our site, we will be here to answer them.",1312294913

And some folks will die through particularly ugly and unpleasant processes.<p>In some specific cases, we do know that the death did not entail any struggling or other manifestations of discomfort.<p>And you are quite wrong about your concept of how a heart attack can present itself.  Some are quite silent.  Some - in older men and particularly  in older females and reportedly due to differences in and degradations in the cardiac innervation - can be undiagnosed or misdiagnosed or missed - and sometimes these cardiac problems might only trigger a so-called syncopal episode.  The person ""zones out"" for a little while, or ""faints"".  This due to a transient drop in blood pressure.<p>In cases I'm very familiar with, the person simply stopped talking to me, and appeared to doze off, and the cardiac monitor went into alert.<p>In others, I've encountered a number of cases where the only evidence of a heart attack was in the cardiac enzymes test, or due to specific artifacts seen in subsequent cardiac monitoring.",1312294222

I feel like a game like that made huge advances by using talented actors and scanning in the faces. They overcame a lot of the uncanny valley that was there before, but the shading still makes the whole scene seem unbelievable.<p>Still though, the artists and actors did a phenomenal job with this game.",1312294157

There are rational questions posed by people you are labeling as conspiracy theorists.  You are trying to discredit them by exaggerating these claims.  Again, there is some evidence of a cover up; there is no evidence of alien involvement.  Your arguments are puerile and a distraction from what we are talking about.",1312294130

They were a small(er) exchange (or is the term ""market maker""?), but they handled about 20% of NASDAQ's daily volume.<p>The good thing was, they would let you buy their data post-facto (not realtime). At the end of the day, you could download their entire set of completed orders for the day. The cost was minimal ($30/month, IIRC).<p>But they were bought out by NASDAQ, and NASDAQ shut down this data-sharing program. Which, to me, reinforces the point that the powers-that-be don't want to lose control of the information; it's a pay-to-play system, and information is one of the privileges to paying the big bucks.<p>One would assume that being a heavily regulated system, it would be expected that all orders would be open to the public (at least the historical ones), to ensure transparency. But one would be mistaken.....",1312294000

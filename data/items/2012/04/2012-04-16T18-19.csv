You can just download packages and get experience with how to best pick models, choose features and tweak (hyper)parameters. If you want to work on or understand it then you will need math.<p>You need a decent understanding of calculus (mid 1800s level, mulitvariate calculus), a more decent understanding of Linear Algebra (1950s ), information theory (1960s),  and probability and statistics. With the last having shifted the most from the past due to more recent respect for bayesian methods.  Note the years in parenthesis is not to say that nothing new has been used from those areas, more like if you pick up a book on that topic from that year you would be pretty well covered for the purposes of ML.<p>Worth having a vague idea of are stuff like PAC learning, topology and computational complexity stuff like Valiant's work on evolvability. If you are doing stuff related to genetic programming then category and type theory have riches to be plundered.<p>Or if you want to be more hardcore and are looking at very higher dimensional data and reductions on them you might look at algebraic geometry (in particular algebraic varieties) and group theory.

And then he pulled together what he considered the best bits of the language and used that subset as a starting point. <a href=""http://anongallery.org/220/javascript-the-good-parts"" rel=""nofollow"">http://anongallery.org/220/javascript-the-good-parts</a><p>@fat - no idea who he is, apart from being an employee of Twitter and works on Twitter Bootcamp, which is a framework for other people to use to build websites.<p>@izs - I think you overreach by grouping him as anti-semi-colon. Isaac is a pragmatist, he uses what suits the group of people he works with. NPM is a standalone app, a non-expert JavaScript developer doesn't need to delve into npm for it's standard usecases. So he choses a syntax he believes suits the group of people working with him. And yet, he is now the lead developer of Node.js, and he's already on record saying he won't be spending time changing Node.js into his preferred comma prefixed approach - because the existing team is already used to post fixed commas. That's what I like about Isaac - he listens to a wide range of opinions, and uses what works best for the environment he's in.<p>Thomas Fuchs - heard of him, he's done lots of stuff JavaScript and PHP wise. I'll give you that one. He gave us Scriptaculous, and some decent PHP resources (like PHPatterns, IIRC). He's active in Rails.<p>The main reason the quality of JavaScript has increased dramatically in the last 6 or 7 years has been because of a coalescing towards a JavaScript best practice. This has mainly been led by Douglas Crockford and JavaScript developers at Yahoo.<p>JavaScript is too flexible and too bastardised a language, leaving lots of weird and broken features. Plus, well written code isn't about being clever, it's about writing code that can be supported and maintained. Douglas has taken the best bits of JavaScript and found that to be quite an effective and useful language. With that subset he, along with the people who later became the YUI library developers wrote code in that subset.<p>The reason for that subset is that the language is clearer, less ambiguous, and less likely to catch a developer out. Turns out using just a subset of JavaScript's syntactic capabilities improves the quality, reliability and maintainability of code.<p>JS Lint was build to help developers bring their code into line with this subset of usage, and disallow perfectly valid but potentially flawed code. It favours code that is readable and quickly understandable by the non-expert developer.<p>JS Lint is the starting point for this improved use of JavaScript. JS Min is built, as far as I understand, with the assumption that JSLint rules are in place, so yes, it works on a subset of the language. Actually the documentation <a href=""http://www.crockford.com/javascript/jsmin.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.crockford.com/javascript/jsmin.html</a> is more specific: ""It is suggested that JSLint be used before using JSMin.""<p>And I guess that's the real problem here. Not using JSLint before using JSMin. And then this argument boils down to @fat saying something along the lines of not wanting to be constrained to JSLint's subset of JavaScript. That's a call he can make, and the users of Twitter Bootcamp can then choose accordingly whether to use the toolkit (since if you are in a JSLint / JSMin using environment, it's probably best to stay away from Twitter Bootcamp.)<p>Perhaps what would be worthwhile is a JSLint equivalent for whatever syntax and idioms the Rails-induced subset of JavaScript uses (not just a watered down version of JSLint that JSHint is, but something that encourages what they consider to be best practice rather than merely allow it), and a minified that respects those idioms. And something in plain English for those unfortunate developers who stumble into these idioms.<p>What would ""JavaScript the Railified Parts"" look like side-by-side with Crockford's The Good Parts, and Flanagan's Definitive Guide?",1334601996

3848684,comment,3847993,3847993,2,0,bashzor,,,"<i>I hugely disagree with this.</i> I'll give 3 examples and some more explanation:<p>I'm not sure about others, but playing GTA 1 at 10 years old didn't make me a serial murderer as far as I know, nor did it offend me to shoot people's heads off on the PS2 with GTA III later. My parents did actually return this game though, they thought it went a bit far. Or my father did, my mother never got to see it, probably for the better.<p>Earlier, I think at about 7-8 years old, I played Command and Conquer 2: Tiberian Sun. I think it was 16+, might have been 18+. Yeah you really could see a few pixels blood for like two fifth of a second. Now that made me a real dictator, and afterwards I was screaming under the table. Sure...<p>Then the last game I really played a lot is OpenArena, mostly a Quake 3 copy. So with real pixels resembling some 90's version of blood and gore. Must say I never noticed it until I started playing a bit more pro, and I noticed the gore was actually in my field of sight. Then I set com_blood 0 and my visibility was improved... I was about 15 when I started playing. The game is 17+ but I only noticed that when I was 17 (I'm 18 now). That, too, didn't quite offend me.<p>So WHY do I ask? Why are we even bothering to print these things on the covers anymore? It is a very slight indication of what age category the game is for, but much more useful would it be to put on the covers something like ""Blatant sex"" or ""Dull game good for children under 10"". Now that won't happen, but the equivalents wouldn't be such a bad idea. Then they could stop making judgments of which size fits all (since you can hardly put up a personality test in the shop before getting an age recommendation).<p>Also something people apparently fail to notice how it's called an age <i>recommendation</i>. Here at least. Still though, as 15-year-old you won't be able to buy a 16+ game. Like the expansion pack for Command and Conquer 3. It doesn't even contain blood or sex or anything! Maybe in the cut-scenes of the campaign, but I never even played that (skirmish and online ftw). How could they know? They can't! So why make anymore judgment than a recommendation?<p><i>Moral of this rant:</i> Parents: Don't you dare looking at the age rating! If it says what's in the game, like drugs or violence, that might be of some use. Best would be to just watch a gameplay trailer someone put on Youtube, then make the best decision for <i>your child</i>. Can you really trust other's to make the best decision?",1334601809

3848642,comment,3848355,3848586,2,0,kprobst,,,"A few months ago I was about to buy a 80s compilation album in MP3 format from Amazon based on nothing more than the names of the songs, when I noticed one of the reviews (not even the top one) was complaining about how these were not the original artists. Sure enough I played a few of the samples and I realized that while the songs (and lyrics) were generally the same, not only the pitch was all wrong on some of them, but the voices and instruments were all kind of ""off"". Needless to say I ended up not buying the album.<p>I think Amazon needs to allow these things on their catalog but at the same time they need to be more clear about the fact that these are either not originals or (in the case of the books) that they're really rip-offs of popular media. It's fairly obvious that these are little more than scams, but the no-returns-allowed electronic format itself and the fact that the amounts involved are small probably plays a part in preventing people from complaining too much once they realize that they've fallen for it.",1334601254

Designers should be much, much easier to find on-sight than good developers. You have a whole world of their work in front of you. You only have to contact them directly and tell them that you are impressed with their work in (insert some site, etc. here) and wondered if they would be willing to consider being competitively reimbursed for a small amount of their time. Then try to close the deal by stating your problem (what you want them to design) briefly without flowery language or sales-gibberish, spelling out what you need their work to accomplish (e.g. Our product/service is X. Our target markets are Y and Z. The different types of users using our site are A and B. A needs to do C, D, and E and B needs to do F, G, and login to do H, and I.

3848605,comment,3847469,3848032,3,0,tel,,,"I think there are essentially two ""deep"" understandings of ML prevalent today. The first is more common: the ability to do the calculus, algebra, and probability derivations required to design complex ML algorithms combined with the CS knowledge to find/design a good algorithm and the software design skill to actually implement it on real, ""big"" data.<p>No doubt this is a difficult position to master and those who perform well are able to tackle lots of mathematical and computational challenges. They also are model builders who (have tendency to) relentlessly seek complex models in order to solve complex problems.<p>The other, rarer side is the learning theorist who may or may not understand the model building, algorithmic, and computational tools but understands well the theories which allow us to have reasonable expectations that the tools of the first group will work at all. These guys have a funny story in that they were the old statisticians who got a major egg-on-the-face after proclaiming that essentially all of ML was impossible. Turns out the first group managed to redefine the problem slightly and make major headway (and money).<p>---<p>The thing I want to bring to light however is that the second group knows the math that bounds the capacities of ML algorithms. This isn't easy. It's one thing to say you recognize that the curse of dimensionality exists, but it's another to have felt it's mathematical curves and to build an intuition for what forces are sufficient to cause disruption.<p>The more experience you have with the learning maths, the more likely you are, I feel, to apply very simple algorithms, to be scared of ""little x's"" (real data) enough to treat it with great care, and to attempt to explore the problem space with confidence for what steps will lead you to folly.<p>---<p>It's a fine line between the two, though. Stray too far to the first group and you'll spend a month building an algorithm that does a millionth of a percentage point better than Fisher's LDA. Spend too much time in the second camp and you'll confidently state that no algorithm exists that does better than a millionth of a percentage point over Fisher LDA... and then lose purely by never trying.",1334600795

Let's just assume the author didn't know this about the Star Wars franchise and let it go. I'm glad people brought it up though because I'm a huge Star Wars fan and I couldn't let it go either.<p>Despite this mistake I'm the post his point still stands. People learn all these skills but fail to understand when to properly use them. A lot of visual design tools like Photoshop have the ability to let you create incredibly complex, technically challenging works but just because you can doesn't mean you should.<p>This seems like a newbie mistake. Newbie learns cool new thing and them uses it everywhere because he can. Usually the cool new thing is more difficult and complex than other things newbie knows and somehow people begin to think harder is better.<p>We're essentially talking about how to use tools. As you fill your toolbox with new tools it's important to remember that every tool has its place and just because you've added a more powerful tool to your box it doesn't mean that from now on that tool should be used in lew of the others. If that were the case then you'd only need one tool. Each time you got a new more powerful tool you'd throw away your old ones and that's exactly what happens a lot of times.<p>I think that phase passes for most of us though and I don't think it's taste that makes people do this too. Rather than taste being the issue I believe it's a matter of skill. Learning how to use more complex and powerful tools is a good skill but an often overlooked skill is learning how all those tools work in concert and knowing when to use which combination. People who work in design especially usually have good taste to begin with, so it isn't taste that's lacking. Instead they're just so enamoured with their growth that they lose the forest for the trees whenever they level up.",1334600436

Create a Clojure DSL for web pages, and render HTML while you edit. Create a Clojure DSL for audio, and render the audio in the browser. Create a Clojure DSL for business users to use to modify business rules, and let them see and interact with their changes right there in the editor. Seamlessly integrated with SVM and your system, the editor becomes more than an editor but a tool for evolving the capabilities of a system by a group of people that include far more than just programmers.<p>It's long been the dream to have an interface like this to do language oriented programming. Some attempts (JetBrains MPS, Intentional Software) seem to fall into the trap of being too holistic (invent everything from scratch) or too complicated. This is a great way forward since it uses just the right cutting edge tech (ClojureScript) with well understood tech (the browser.)<p>If it were me, here is how I would look at this project. This shouldn't be an IP/tool play. Make the tool free. What you are doing here is inventing a new way to build software. You want the world to shift to your vision. You want everyone to have it and not be willing to give it up. The posters in this thread lamenting they will have to abandon vi should be forced to look back years from now and laugh at themselves since a purely textual, console-based editor should look downright silly if you pull this off. (Yes, I am a hardcore vim user, but even I can see this is the beginning of a generational shift.)<p>Build facilities into the tool to let people mold it into an environment <i>everyone</i> in an organization can use to develop software collaboratively and in a domain-driven way. Make it so it will become an integrated part of any software development project. Make it so people can develop and iterate things in a startup-like way 10x faster than they can do now. Make it so the tool helps break down communication barriers that have existed since we started building software.<p>In the end, if this approach wins, you will be <i>the</i> authority on it. Once this has come together, you will easily make a killing on consulting and building custom domain-specific modules for high paying customers. Use the knowledge you learn from those experiences to improve the general purpose product. Write books on how to develop software this way. Get people to pay for training sessions. Spread the word.<p>The end game for this is wider in scope than you can probably imagine, if done right. It's not a matter of if but when. This is an important project and you will surely not be the only one trying to solve it. A good way to ensure the next person who works on this is able to overtake you is if theirs is the one that you can get for free.",1334600319

3848532,comment,3847993,3847993,9,0,ChuckMcM,,,"I resonate with the rant (not so much the light grey text on white theme but that's something else) which is that many parents are not proactive in their kids upbringing with regard to morals or societal expectations. But lets look at that part of it for a moment.<p>Parents are really busy these days, most often they both work, a depressing number are single parents, they have a certain amount of 'parent/child interaction' time available when they are both in the same place as their child and they are not asleep. Further, the normal foibles of kids consume some of that time uncontrollably (you have to go to the doctor to get that bean pulled out of your nose, you have a history project due tomorrow that needs help, going to and from soccer / band / daycare / school Etc. Parents also need times for themselves to process work stress, spouse stress, family issues, etc.<p>Now in that environment your kids like to play computer games (seems pretty common) and the friction of getting games is fairly loose, but games (like books) can introduce your kids to concepts before you as a parent have had a chance to put some structure around it. That will lead to questions and discussions that really do have to happen 'right now' because not giving kids any guidance when they encounter those questions is really bad parenting. My personal opinion is that 90% of a parent's 'job' is to prepare your kids for the society they are about to enter, poor preparation reflects badly on them, on you, and is generally a losing proposition for society in general.<p>So 'read the box' as an indicator for 'good parenting' is not sufficient.<p>We always made dinner time a time when everyone got together, had a meal, and <i>talked</i>. We have an old copy of the World Book encyclopedia, a dictionary, the CRC Handbook of Physics and Chemistry, a world atlas (post USSR breakup) and the desktop science reference all to settle arguments of fact :-). But more importantly as our children aged we talked about money, violence, relationships, crimes of intent, crimes of passion, morality vs legality, responsibility, politics, civics, religion, and books. The goal was to have the conversation about a topic started <i>before</i> it came up as a question so that when it did come up they would bring it to the table and we'd talk about it.<p>So exhorting someone to do that, embrace parenting as your primary responsibility to your children, its a good thing. But I totally understand when folks are so exhausted from the rest of their life that it takes a back seat.<p>So read the box, talk about 'cartoon violence' versus 'real' violence, go sit in the local ER some time if you're in a major metropolitan city to see what 'real' suffering looks like rather than on screen, add a med kit and blam back into the action. Most kids can separate imaginary from real at a pretty young age. Personally I don't think it is inappropriate to understand reproduction and sex fairly young, it's probably not worth trying to explain the impact on ones brain until puberty since it's really hard to convey that the chemistry of your body can work against your judgement.<p>Understand that when you have kids it is a bigger commitment than just saving money for them to go to college. :-)",1334599684

I love .Net and I think Azure is really good, even if the article says it's too cumbersome for a small project. I think the fact that developers can forget all about server configuration and implementation and just start a VM in one click is nice.",1334599544

3848516,comment,3836978,3845855,2,0,drostie,,,"Just to answer your question with regards to (2):<p>Suppose I open up LibreOffice Calc, and my first row gets the values ""c"", ""x"", ""y"" in that order, as labels for three columns. The second row gets the values 2, -2, 0. The third row gets the odd formulas:<p><pre><code>    =A2, =B2 + 0.02, =B3 * B3 + A3 * B3 - 1
</code></pre>
Now I highlight C3 and drag it up to C2 (the y=0 term which shouldn't be y=0 is now correct). I also highlight A3 through C3 and drag it down, until my x's range from -2 to +2; this happens at row 202.<p>The key thing is, this ""dragging autofill"" has quickly managed to make all of the y computations dependent on the same c, whose authoritative value is stored at cell A2. (I can also change what x's I look at by tweaking the cell B2.)<p>So I highlight the x and y columns, click the Chart button, to do a scatterplot, lines only -- no point markers. Then I need to kill the autoadjustment of the y axis because it will confuse me, so I set it to go from y = -5 to +10.<p>Now I can just start modifying this parameter c in cell A2, and see how the graph changes. I might notice for example that the vertex of the parabola hits a maximum when c = 0. That's an interesting feature; it suggests that the vertex of the parabola describes its own parabola as you vary c. Et cetera.<p>The only reason for doing it this way is because that is the easiest way I know of to get the computation right for 200 data cells. You're right, I could hand-write 200 different computations to all point to A2. It would take a long time and I would hate my life. I could also write in the value ""2"" and whenever I want to change it, drag across 200 rows. But then I would never get to see how this thing changes. (If you've never seen it, see Bret Victor's ""Inventing on Principle"" talk for a discussion of the power of having a direct connection with your artistic creations.)",1334599454

If his business model is superior, he may eventually drive the old company out of business and employ at least as many maids as they did. Even if he only employed the same amount as the old company, he is providing more value to his customers, either through increased efficiency or lower costs. So even in the case of there being no new jobs created, creative destruction has again moved our economy forward.<p>Judging by how fast his first maid came to his company, I doubt he pays them less (I didn't see him mention this).",1334599372

Anything that helps the web as a whole, pretty much helps Google as a whole. This is why if you care about the Internet, Google will be your ally in most cases (yes, not all). That's why they helped with SOPA, too. And they will probably continue to remain an ally in such cases.<p>So just because Google has something to gain from it (otherwise why would they even do it?) doesn't mean they are wrong on what they are saying about the walled gardens like Facebook and Apple. A more open Internet would help Google, but would also help new start-ups. It would help the <i>next</i> Google as well. Imagine if every website would've been a walled garden in the early 2000's. We wouldn't even have a search engine right now, or at least not a very useful one.",1334599320

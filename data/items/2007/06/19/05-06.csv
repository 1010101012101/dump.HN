So, you get what you get.<p>I doubt any CEO's salary comes near the theoretical market value of the job.<p>In Japan, CEOs make much, much less, and they don't seem to be hurting as a result. I'm inclined to dispute the ""superstar"" theory of upper-level executives. Semel's defining moment came when he decided not to buy google. This is tantamount to a baseball player deciding not to swing the bat--hoping for a ball. Not much of a superstar.",1182232008

They're both full-time commitments and one almost always loses the battle for attention.<p>Tom Leykis (much hated LA ""shock jock"") advises (paraphrasing): <i>Do not get married until you've achieved your dream in life.</i><p>I think that's good advice to take, even if it's tough thing to face.

What's the difference between watching a lecture in an auditorium and watching HD-quality video in one's living room or beach cabana?</i><p>There's no difference at all but for any even mildly ambitious undergrad in a STEM field, physically attending a research university is an opportunity to get involved, however peripherally, in such research.

5766978,comment,5766751,5766907,0,0,Surio,,," I re-read it, to see if the metaphor has been stretched a little too far. Nope. You seem to have drawn your Historical lessons correctly, and kept the narrative to the point (Chilling read though!). However, begs a few questions:<p>1. Are we doomed, as a species <i>with sentience and recall</i>, to repeat the same historical mistakes over and over again?<p>2. This is the only ""flaw"" that I could find, really: While organised religion has definitely been a stranglehold over humans during the European dark ages, right now, in many parts of the World, it is not Atheism, but fundamentalism that is  more and more prevalent (N.B: Lest people be mistaken, I am not talking about Islam only, or singling it out here). So, that one fell slightly off the mark for me.<p>3. We are also moving towards a post-peak, energy-scarce, capital-scarce, World scenario, so perhaps, these trends might themselves reverse, or die-out before reaching the kind of critical mass it reached during the Roman collapse?<p>But, in general, yours' is a very lateral observation, radically different from the  ""celebrate all things technology"" article linked.

I didn't go to a prestigious university, but I do think I ended up with a good education.

While this was in-person, with labs/instruction from 8:00 AM to 6:00 PM every day, and the class was limited to twelve students, it does put things into perspective.<p>The real cost, as always, in getting a degree is the students time.   Someone capable of getting a Masters degree, can, without too much effort, make $100K/year pretty quickly (If income is what they are interested in).<p>This is why education is normally inexpensive in other countries - students are having to forego all that income, so it's in the interest of the country, to encourage their populace to become educated - so they subsidize.<p>I think part of the reason why Education is so expensive in the United States, is they have a fairly regressive tax system, with poor social systems (in comparison to other first world countries).

I said it before, but it's worth repeating: today's code become's tomorrow's legacy code, and certain early architectural decisions can make a hell of a difference later.<p>Your argument is like saying you're going to build a house but don't know if anyone will want to live in it, so instead of doing it properly you're going to use anything to build it regardless of how suitable, and regardless of how well the construction will stand up against the weather. If someone chooses to live in it, well, crumbling is a great problem to have because you got there first. If you're going to say this analogy is stretched (I'd disagree), think about it in terms of security. Writing decently secure software takes a little bit more mental overhead. Is it worth it to write a secure application from the ground up in spite of not knowing whether users will adopt the service? (The answer is always yes.)<p>Also, first mover advantage is a myth. There are plenty of examples of the first, or early mover, being toppled by someone who came along later.<p>Premature optimization means creating code that's difficult to comprehend without justification in the name of performance, not thinking about which language/framework/vm is going to yield a decent performance profile overall.",1369482280

Either way, the traditional application process students have to go through is largely what bases the perceived weight of degree, so this course still keeping that 'metric' in-tact should help with its 'marketability'.

I come from a country where Higher Education is free(yes yes I know - paid for by the taxpayer), but I have personally studied in the UK paying 3450 pounds a year (~5300 USD) in one of the best universities in that country. Yes I know it went up now to 9000 pounds(~13600 USD) but still, it's a lot less than what they charge for education in the US, which I don't understand.",1369480118

Suddenly, everyone who's got a GMail account can be called via Hangouts - instant network effect.<p>Sure, anyone else can also implement group video chat relatively easily thanks to WebRTC, but why would people use the new services? All of the people they'd want to call are on Hangouts, not that new service - and thanks to Google killing federation, you can't call Hangouts users from other services.",1369480003

I might be misunderstanding how common this is but it seems any discussion of Grad School cost should discuss the fact that natural science students will often get paid to go to Grad School in the US.",1369479987

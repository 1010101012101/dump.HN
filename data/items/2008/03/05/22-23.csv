130070,story,,,2,2,mixmax,"Ask YC: SQL Help ! (feel free to ignore)",,"First: I'm sorry if this isn't aproppriate, and the right place to post it. Feel free to flame me, downmod me, and generally be a nuisance. But since I've been around here for a while I know that there will be someone that can help me.<p>I've recently decided to take up programming and find it to be great fun. (I've always been the biz and ideas guy) However, I've run into a problem that I can't quite figure out. I've tried different forums, asking people, etc. but nobody seems able to help.<p>Anyway here's the question:<p>I have three tables in a mySQL db: list, labels, and content.<p>The idea is to be able to create a matrix with entries from list along one axis, entries from labels along another axis, and entries from content as the intersection of the two. The content table has a field that corresponds to a field in labels, and a field that corresponds to a field in list so that I am able to place it correctly in the matrix.<p>Now i want to do a SQL query that returns an array with items from the content table, ordered on the X axis by fields in the list table, and  ordered on the y axis by fields in the labels table.<p>The reason for wanting to do this is that I want to create a number of  HTML tables with columns that will change, and are not the same for all HTML tables.<p>And again: sorry if this post is inappropriate. I hope I have enough karma for someone to bother helping me out.<p>Links, clues etc. would be great. I don't mind figuring stuff out for myself.<p>Help me Obi-wan Kanobi - you're my only hope....",1204757367

It has a few nice touches, but generally is slow and badly designed.<p>Cons:<p>1. Slow. Much slower to navigate around than gmail. This is   killer.<p>2. Mail receiving is slow. Sending a mail to gmail, appears in under 30 seconds. Sending a mail to AOL mail took over 5 minutes to appear.<p>3. Interface is confusing. Create a contact and the button to actually do the create is above and to the right of the form?<p>4. Filtering is too hard to access, doesn't show you a preview of what will be filtered.<p>5. Way too much space taken up with ads.<p>Pros:<p>1. Calendar integration is good. Nice to have it right there in the same interface.",1204757357

I was able to get 50% pro-bono rates because I had started a 501(c)3 non-profit that had a related interest in the case.<p>I once avoiding having to hire an attorney to sue a non-paying client by suing the company myself in small claims court for $30 in fees. You can't file anything electronically, and the courts like old-fashioned cash or checks payments in person, so it's anathema to the ways high-tech entrepreneurs, but it worked. I got a check for the remaining amount the next day; the other company simply didn't want to show up for court.<p>Writing blunt letters to the CEOs of large companies can be effective. I've saved thousands of dollars in costs by writing letters. I inadvertently ended up altering the manufacturing process for a well-known company's blade servers, as well.<p>Writing blunt letters to lawyers who overbill you can also be effective. I've been billed for other clients' time, billed double for a new attorney to join a case due to the original attorney having to go on maternity leave, billed for ""this isn't my area of expertise"" as advice, etc. The law firm may not agree to work with you again afterward, but they won't make you pay if you have a point. After all, they have bigger fish to fry.<p>Gold and platinum credit cards have extended warranty programs that will usually take care of issues with faulty equipment that would otherwise probably require a lawsuit to actually gain anything. I've saved several thousand dollars thanks to such programs, as well.<p>Lastly, I was able to borrow some standard agreements from my family business.",1204756508

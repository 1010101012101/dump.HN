767663,comment,766918,767292,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"<i>Similarly, how did Yahoo Answers and AnswerBag successfully launch their question/answer sites?</i><p>This is why I explicitly brought up answer sites.  Your idea doesn't get the benefits of those kinds of sites, because publishing the expertise limits your ability to sell it (and makes it into another answers site).  If you don't publish it the site does not become incrementally more valuable every time a question is answered, as Stack Overflow or Yahoo Answers does.  It <i>always</i> remains a place where someone can buy expertise from someone they don't know, with qualifications that may or may not be accurate, for a price that cannot be compared.<p>My point is that your proposal seems like it would have all of the negatives of starting a new answers site, but none of the long term benefits.  Answers sites start off with these problems, but may eventually overcome them as more and more questions get answered and the pool of regular readers and submitters grows, but yours would have these problems forever.  Your site doesn't get bigger, stickier, and more powerful, when you sign on new users and new experts.<p>I'm not saying you can't do it, or that it won't be successful.  I don't know.  As Paul Buccheit says:<p>Limited Life Experience + Overgeneralization = Advice<p>I simply don't see how you (or even Google, who have retired their own Google Answers) could overcome those barriers and reach a self-sustaining business.<p>As someone that connects industry specific knowledge to people that need knowledge, and perhaps has tools that make that task easier, you could very well have a lucrative consulting gig.  But, I don't know that you'd have a startup.<p>But, what do I know?  I build systems management software.",1250499582

767660,comment,766796,766933,0,0,pudo,,,"You're right: journalists will determine the future of journalism. I think the more relevant question is whether journalism is where we will get the news in a few years.<p>At the moment, it seems to me like we're finding new, social (in the W2.0 sense) methods of distributing information that are ""good enough"" to destroy the business model for news. ""Good enough"" doesn't mean their information is equal or better compared to the information that journalism yielded. Of course, most of this social news is still based off ""MSM"" news, but I believe that, as their availability decreases, their necessity as a base will aswell.<p>I think that sometimes there is a tragic logical error in some of the 'future of journalism' discussion: ""The News business model is done. User's won't pay for the news any more. Ads don't scale. The hurricanes themselves won't pay, either. Thus, we have to find a new business model.""<p>This last statement is always there, especially in the RFS and the entrepreneur's discussions following it here. But it is <i>not</i> a necessity. I guess it is a part of a healthy capitalistic mindset to see every industries downfall as an opportunity, but I get the feeling that some of the internets peer production developments escape this pattern:  Wikipedia will not produce business opportunities for encyclopedia business, OpenStreetMap will not help NAVTEQ.<p>Of course each of these examples produces a periphery of new businesses, consulting opportunities and the usual post-processing stuff, but in their core they have de-economized industries.<p>So I get wary when I hear people talk on how to monetize post-news news. You really won't. Go write a blog post about some of your local communities problems instead.",1250499406

767646,comment,767579,767579,0,0,gdp,,,"> <i>So forgive me for being smarmy and offensive, but I have no interest in being a ‘web guy’. And there are two reasons for this.  First, it’s not a challenging medium for me.  And second, because the vast majority of Internet companies are filled with bad engineers – precisely because you don’t need to know complicated things to be a web developer.  As far as I’m concerned, the Internet is responsible for a collective dumbing down of our intelligence.  You just don’t have to be that smart to throw up a webpage.</i><p>Sighhhhh.  The entire tone of this article suggests somebody who has never done a lot of web programming, and is making a classic ""I-haven't-done-it-so-it-must-be-easy"" kind of judgement, with a very idealised view of the glamour of his own sub-discipline of software development.<p>Sure, there is a huge amount of very mundane web programming in the world.  But there is a proportionally larger of amount of very mundane non-web programming in the world, too.  95% of the programming that goes on the world is not ""challenging"" to a good developer.<p>Taking a very reductionist viewpoint, web programming is just the same as non-web programming, but with a demand that the output from your program is structured in particular ways.  I'm sure anyone can think of hundreds of examples of technically challenging and innovate programming that is best suited to delivery in a web environment?<p>I get as annoyed with really bad web programmers as the next guy, but that's only because the web permits users to inflict their work on others much earlier in the development process than most mediums.  Back in the days when I was first learning BASIC, the commercial internet was not so well-developed that I could easily inflict my software on a large group of people.  Even if I did, my ""death valley"" clone would probably have had limited appeal.<p>With the web, pretty much anybody learning a language like PHP or ASP or whatever can basically do some copy-and-paste programming and have something up on the web ready for public consumption before they have even finished figuring out how programming works.",1250499015

But the actual learning does not, in fact if anything it goes faster.<p>So all this may simply be due to an illusion, where 'wall time' vs 'process time' are further apart than they used to be and you're measuring by 'wall time'.<p>You're probably every bit as sharp if not sharper than you used to be, but you perceive it to be otherwise.",1250498980

Most server side errors are easy because you can configure alert emails. Subtle data corruption or client side bugs are much harder to pin point as they manifest much further down the pipe in unintuitive ways.<p>Subtle data corruption bugs aside, is there someway to handle client side bugs? I'm no Javascript expert, but I'd imagine there has got to be a way to register a global on-error handler and post bug reports to the server? Any expert insight here?",1250498859
767642,comment,767082,767281,0,0,slackenerny,,,"Ehh, memories… I have yet to finish that book.<p>Dirac said, <i>“follow mathematical idea wherever it leads”</i>. When I first opened ths book years ago, unpublished draft then, I just skimmed the ToC, checked a few problems and then to my horror encountered that interesting approach to restricted three–body problem (nicely wrapped as the “Jupiter” problem in the book). I was horrified because I had a lead on that too… and there – it's all in textbooks. That situation allowed no relaxed wackiness in my thinking about it anymore, I had to formulate my thoughts. ‘I need more math’, I thought. When I finally digged out of that rabbit hole I found myself learned in dynamical systems, ergodic theory, harmonic analysis, spectral theory, operator algebras, homology, algebraic topology, and constructive renormalization, and in numerical methods, symbolic dynamics, symbolic algebra, Grobner bases and group cohomology and applied algebraic geometry, and then Hopf algebra of Connes–Kreimer computable renormalization and, uh, followed Connes the way up to motivic integration… (ok. ok. I'm done enumerating now) at which point I lost all interest in physics and turned mathematician.<p>All that not to mention intersection of algebra and topology of statistical mechanics with coding theory and infromation theory which led me to machine learning (which is just statistics btw).<p>I'm unsure what the moral is. That was not healthy. (OTOH, mathematicians have high life expectancy, routinely living up to 90, gauging from AMS Notices obituareis).",1250498825

767593,comment,767136,767294,0,0,a-priori,,,"As far as anyone knows, synaesthesia is a fundamental property of how some people's brains are wired, where the interconnections between two areas of sensory cortex are abnormally strong. Thus, when one area is activated (by perceiving a letter, for example), the activation spreads to the other area (for perceiving a colour). It's something that would develop very early on (probably <i>in utero</i>, and surely by soon after birth).<p>In adults, you might theoretically be able to induce permanent synaesthesia by repeated Tetanic stimulation of the two areas of cortex simultaneously. This may induce a strengthening of the connections between the two areas via Hebbian learning.<p>On the other hand, this might destroy your ability to perceive both letters and colour, or cause other brain damage. There would be no guarantee that the results would be of any use to you at all (remember that synaesthesics grow up experiencing the world this way). And that's assuming you could even identify the appropriate areas. Needless to say, no surgeon would do this.<p>Sorry, LSD is still your best bet. :)",1250496318

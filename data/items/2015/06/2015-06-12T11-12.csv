Even on the 960x1080 DK2, the readability of text has more to do with texture quality (both total resolution and good filtering for mipmaps). On a 2d display, the pixels are static on the display and text is mapped essentially 1-to-1 (or a fixed n-to-m when using subpixel antialiasing). But on an HMD, antialiasing is basically &#x27;free&#x27;, and the constant, minuscule bob of the head creates a dynamic, temporal aliasing that improves the readability of the text. We&#x27;ve known about the effect since the 80s or 90s, when psychologists figured out the dynamic environment of real flight improved the apparent eyesight of pilots over static images.<p>There are a lot of people who are doing text wrong in VR. You don&#x27;t render at 10pt and expect it to look right. You have to pay attention and not just take the default settings.<p>I&#x27;ve spent much time reading and writing text in VR and it hasn&#x27;t been a problem. If building a real, live code editing environment were my goal, I could have it done in a week. But I have different goals.",1434110398

9705291,comment,9704698,9704985,0,0,jcfrei,,,"I am also very concerned about the implications of ISDS for democracies. However I would not argue that TTIP should be abolished entirely because of it. Studies expect an annual increase in GDP growth of about half a percent - which doesn&#x27;t seem like much considering the historical GDP growth, but GDP growth is expected to be much weaker in the western hemisphere than in the past - so we shouldn&#x27;t outright dismiss half a percent as too little.<p>Furthermore, as mentioned by other commentators, ISDS is already a part of many treaties. However one fundamental flaw - which is a part of many of the previous treaties involving ISDS - was that the conditions required for allowing corporations to sue governments were very loosely defined: The treaties usually allow corporations to sue governments if any kind of <i>&quot;indirect expropriation&quot;</i> occurs - From a paper on CETA: <i>&quot;Indirect expropriation can only occur when the investor is substantially deprived of the fundamental attributes of property such as the right to use, enjoy and dispose of its investment; &quot;</i> (1)<p>This clause allows corporations to sue against a very broad range of policy measures. The TTIP supposedly contains a more detailed outline under what circumstances corporations can sue (2):<p><pre><code>    • We have reaffirmed the right to regulate. In CETA we have made clear in the preamble of the agreement that the EU and Canada preserve their right to regulate and to achieve legitimate policy objectives, such as public health, safety, environment, public morals and the promotion and protection of cultural diversity. 

    • We have defined key concepts like “fair and equitable treatment” and “indirect expropriation”, in order to prevent abuse. For the first time, CETA provides a definition of these terms. &quot;Fair and equitable treatment&quot; is defined through a clear, closed text which defines precisely the content of the standard without leaving unwelcome discretion to arbitrators. Moreover, detailed language has been agreed upon to clarify what constitutes indirect expropriation, particularly excluding claims against legitimate public policy measures.
</code></pre>
As it so often happens during negotiations, the fundamental decisions are made when definitions are being defined. Only if the policy makers in the US and EU can agree on a very specific definition of &quot;indirect expropriation&quot; that is not vulnerable to abuses by corporate lawyers, then we can hope for a good long term outcome for the consumer. And if these requirements are enforced in the arbitration courts, then the ISDS in my opinion becomes a much more sensible part of the treaty. However due to the secrecy involved in the current negotiations, I don&#x27;t know which exact definitions are currently part of the treaty.<p>(1) <a href=""http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2013/november/tradoc_151918.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2013/november/tradoc_1...</a><p>(2) <a href=""http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2015/may/tradoc_153408.PDF"" rel=""nofollow"">http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2015/may/tradoc_153408...</a>",1434110023

And moral move on his part telling us upfront or is it bragging? Is this what everyone does these days? Piss on your house and tell you you got a piss stain on your house?

It&#x27;s certainly not the case that companies like GOOG/FB/MS are filled with all bozzos. If anything their interview process have been rather successful considering above average quality of talent at these companies and non-trivial products they work on.<p>I also sense lot of &quot;entitlement&quot; in OP&#x27;s post and comments on this thread. It&#x27;s like &quot;oh I can&#x27;t answer your interview questions but I&#x27;m so good that if I don&#x27;t get the job, it would be only because your interview process sucks&quot;. Most company&#x27;s HR would let you know what to expect at these interviews. If you are not comfortable with CS whiteboarding questions then you should just decline at that point. It&#x27;s unprofessional to blame their process after you accepted to go through it, failed and then shit all over it <i>because</i> you didn&#x27;t get the job.<p>This is not to say all interviewers are good and many could be downright assholes. But that feedback should be between you and their HR. It&#x27;s just professional courtesy considering that these companies don&#x27;t post on Internet how badly you performed on interviews compared to their other candidates to tell other side of your story.<p>Personally I like solving computational challenges whether I get job or not. As a programmers we are <i>supposed</i> to be loving these kind of CS puzzles. If nothing else, you walk out with few CS things you didn&#x27;t knew before which would have taken same amount of time to learn anyway. I&#x27;m not saying interview questions shouldn&#x27;t be job related but the fact is that many of these companies are doing LOTs of things and they need to hire more generally because they give you relatively more freedom to move around once you are in. So large companies have to keep things general at some level unlike startups with one project.

You don&#x27;t need to calculate the full state, only k entries when your maximum edit distance is k, because the other entries are going to be greater than k anyway. So it&#x27;s actually O(nk), so it&#x27;s linear in n (that paper assumes that the max edit distance and the alphabet size are fixed, so by their assumption O(nk) = O(n)). But I think you are missing what a Levenshtein automaton is. The point of a Levenshtein automaton is not to calculate the edit distance. In fact a Levenshtein automaton does not need to calculate the edit distance at all. What a Levenshtein automaton with max distance k to a word &quot;banana&quot; does is this: it determines whether given a prefix like &quot;caba&quot;, is there a way to extend that prefix such that the distance to &quot;banana&quot; is less than k. The dynamic programming algorithm does not do this. They are two different (but of course related) problems.<p>> In fact, even for that it&#x27;s a relatively bad implementation because it constructs a new list in every step, whereas you could just reuse the same two lists (called score in your implementation) all the time.<p>Of course, it&#x27;s a proof of concept not a fast implementation. Plus it&#x27;s not as simple as keeping two lists when you&#x27;re searching a text index, because from the same state you will need to calculate multiple successor states. If you destroy the state s when stepping you can&#x27;t step from that same state s with another letter.<p>> An L1 cache miss, L2 hit costs around 10 cycles, and the L2 cache is more than sufficiently large<p>A normal full text index does not even fit in L3. Perhaps it does not even fit in memory.<p>> You have not shown how you prune the search, so I can&#x27;t say anything about that. Of course that&#x27;s the entire point of having an index.<p>Pruning the search works exactly the same way given any implementation of a Levenshtein automaton. It&#x27;s just intersecting the automaton with the index.<p>> Whether or not you built Levenshtein automata is a pointless discussion. You say you built a DFA for Levenshtein distance (true). I&#x27;m saying that you didn&#x27;t implement the paper. Both are correct.<p>I never claimed to implement the algorithm in the paper. Whether or not it&#x27;s a Levenshtein automaton is not a pointless discussion. Lucene improved their fuzzy text search times by 100x by pruning the search. You can do that with my method too. That&#x27;s why the goal here is &quot;implement a Levenshtein automaton&quot; not &quot;implement a Levenshtein automaton with the algorithm described in paper XYZ&quot;.<p>> I&#x27;m just pointing out that your implementation, while it was fast to write, is also much much slower than their algorithm, and you shouldn&#x27;t compare the two as if they were the same.<p>Even if my algorithm for constructing the DFA is 10x slower than theirs (which I HIGHLY doubt), it still wouldn&#x27;t matter because you can still use it to get their ~100x speedup because it does exactly the same pruning and the cost of the automaton is just noise.",1434107414

Now with the rise of successful startups and the national interest towards them, working at a startup is considered good and trendy and rather, most of the CS students avoid large companies. Even my mom was proud and supportive when I cofounded a startup, and she&#x27;s always been the one to advocate for a good and stable job.",1434107041

This &quot;master&quot; repository is then tested with consumer driven contracts for each of the referenced submodules, with subsequent &quot;green&quot; masters for deployment to staging.<p>This submodule approach requires a lot of discipline for small teams, and on more than one occasion we have encountered the usual submodule concerns. I&#x27;m concerned that this will only become more problematic as the team grows.<p>What are your thoughts for a replacement process?",1434106925

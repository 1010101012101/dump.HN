In fact, I&#x27;ll claim that if you&#x27;re a software engineer in Pittsburgh, then you&#x27;re in a dead-end job as long as you remain in Pittsburgh.<p>Yes, you&#x27;ll have a very nice quality of life; however, you have significantly less opportunities as a software engineer there. Aside from a few firms, Pittsburgh doesn&#x27;t have an industry that provides the environment, training, challenges and opportunities of both large technology firms and a robust startup community that you see in other major tech hubs. This lowers the wages and, to be frank, lowers the quality of engineers available to hire in Pittsburgh. It makes it more difficult to move out for engineers who have spent the formative part of their career in Pittsburgh.<p>And that&#x27;s fine. Software programming isn&#x27;t the be-all end-all of human activity. It&#x27;s awesome to be part of something bigger, delivering real value aside from shipping the next social-photo-sharing-app. But just because you can get software programming jobs in Pittsburgh in no way allows Pittsburgh to compare to San Francisco, Seattle, NYC, LA, Boston, Austin...

I have lots of friends there and I could go out to awesome bars and concerts and comedy shows, and it was generally a great time.<p>Eventually though, I wanted better opportunities. Nobody wanted to pay in New York. If I looked for web design gigs on Craigslist and elsewhere, everybody seemed to think $10/hour was a fair rate. It was insulting. So I got the hell out.<p>I moved to DC in 2008 and haven&#x27;t really looked back. In 2008, it was considerably cheaper, and salaries were generally higher. After struggling to find a decent job when I was first planning to move to New York, I was shocked to find that there were many companies and organizations in DC that were jumping to hire me.<p>Now I live just outside the city. I actually have kids and own a house. Those things would have never been an option in New York, unless I was willing to raise my kids in a shithole apartment. Granted, DC&#x27;s cost of living is astronomical, but it&#x27;s still way more accessible than New York.<p>Everything that I like about New York is still there when I visit once a year or so.

I wouldn&#x27;t advise against it. But if you&#x27;re looking to ever settle down in New York, it&#x27;s not a good idea.<p>I don&#x27;t know if any city comes close to New York in terms of the entertainment and culture options available there.

DC&#x27;s Metro is beautiful but functionally, it&#x27;s only a tiny fraction of the New York subway.<p>Even in DC, I, I keep thinking of how low the cost of living is in Baltimore or Harrisburg, and whether maybe I should try to convince my employer to let me become part- or full-time remote, and take my DC salary to someplace with a lower cost of living.",1403029556

For road travel, maybe it&#x27;s a pass through city if you are starting in Philly and are driving to Cleveland, Detroit, or Chicago, but most of the traffic in the NE Corridor opts for I-80 to the north, which is much more direct and a much easier drive than the Turnpike.<p>Pittsburgh also doesn&#x27;t have much of a metropolitan area surrounding it. The drop-off from downtown to rural is rather stark. And while there are indeed some nice neighborhoods (Shadyside and Squirrel Hill within the city...

(No offense to yoga, I do it myself).<p>It started off innocently enough, but soon became (in my opinion) very obviously a cult. Not only did they make ridiculous claims and demand large amounts of money, it became all consuming, especially for his wife. My friend sometimes talked about &quot;enlightened masters&quot; and if that phrase doesn&#x27;t ring the CULT bell I don&#x27;t know what will. I became a bit concerned and suggested he stop going. He didn&#x27;t listen. Soon enough, his wife was spending lots of private time with one of the instructors or officials at the local center. My friend was not concerned because according to him, that particular individual had transcended the desires of flesh and was pure in intent. At least... until his wife confessed to having sex with the guy (I&#x27;m sure this is against Dahn policy and this particular incident doesn&#x27;t indite the entire &quot;cult&quot;.... it&#x27;s just the kind of danger cults bring). So, after a few &quot;I told you sos&quot; my friend and (reluctantly) his wife agreed to quit the Dahn center. A few months after that they joined some kind of fringe pentecostal church (what is wrong with people?). I shook my head in disgust and stopped hanging out with him. Later he and his wife divorced and he moved away and we lost contact.<p>I still see ads for Dahn from time to time portraying them as a harmless yoga center set up in the strip mall.

But that is some serious scope creep, but as someone who consumes most forms of digital media from freelancers and amateur content producers, it has to be incredibly annoying as someone who uses multiple services to have their art on deviantart, their music on soundcloud and bandcamp, their videos on youtube, their blog on tumblr, and their web games on newgrounds or armor games.<p>One major roadblock in content hosting, as the founder of imgur has came foward about on many occasions, is the raw size of the content database, plus the bandwidth costs. I think popcorntime has soundly demonstrated the capabilities of the torrent protocol to handle real time streaming - the startup time has significant overhead, but given sufficient health in the network can stream effectively. I&#x27;d definitely look into distributing any larger videos, audio, games, and photo galleries via torrents since they would all be CC licensed. Of course then you aren&#x27;t talking about a website anymore since you can&#x27;t integrate functionality like that in the browser, so it is kind of a tangential idea, but I primarily develop in Qt and think it would be a real realistic cross platform deployable application on every platform if wanted to go the app route. I could see there still being a website.<p>And then you get into monetization, which was youtubes problem. I think patreon and kickstarter are soundly proving that patronage is a perfectly viable business model. I find it baffling that the only service I know that does patronage or subscriptions is Twitch, but even that is just a very cut and dry $5 a month.<p>I guess in part that is because all the payment mechanisms out there are antiquated pains in the ass. And for a startup to try to integrate payments like that would be a huge legal mess. I&#x27;d rather just give users blockchain.io wallets and let them put money in on their own, like bitcointip or dogecointip do on reddit - that model has proven <i>hugely</i> successful. And as cryptocurrencies enter the mainstream, I think that kind of business would be prime to explode.<p>Instead of fixed payments, it would be integrated in all the content pages with every feasible way to pay - buying swag, patreon style per content gifts, kickstarter esque projects where you propose a project and get it funded preemptively, monthly subscriptions like Twitch, and one time quick donations. I would imagine users might want to still monetize via adds, but I would rather such a service be funded through, say, 5% of all patronage transactions than through ad networks, because that makes you beholden to their demands for how to run your service. It gives you immediate monetization metrics so as long as you can get some audience and if people actually funded the artists it would probably be profitable quickly.<p>But hey, that is just me. All my colleagues and mailing lists think I&#x27;m crazy. I keep throwing it around and if I ever met a few folks interested in trying it I&#x27;d definitely be up for giving it a major go - I think its the inevitable &quot;maximal&quot; solution to intellectual content.<p>Wow, that was quite the rant.

The two were built under very different regimes, and it&#x27;s not productive to conflate them.<p>> you need to look into the initial subsidies when it was first laid down, the most common being a local monopoly.<p>In general, a &quot;subsidy&quot; is something that yields a return to the company or industry above the market return. A local monopoly is not necessarily, and usually isn&#x27;t, a subsidy. The monopoly &quot;carrot&quot; is combined with a yoke: universal service requirements and regulated rates. Local utility monopolies generally earn lower returns than unregulated companies. Indeed, it&#x27;s the height of irony that you call local monopolies a &quot;subsidy&quot; then cite Kushnick further down, whose whole shtick is that deregulation (i.e. elimination of the local monopolies) was a huge &quot;subsidy&quot; to the telecom companies.<p>Also, the cable industry was deregulated in 1992. DOCSIS 1.0 wasn&#x27;t released until 1997. I doubt much of the infrastructure that was built under exclusive franchises is still there, because the mid/late-1990&#x27;s involved widespread network upgrades to accommodate cable internet.

The vast majority of the &quot;subsidies&quot; for broadband are actually transfer payments from the Universal Service Fund. This amounts to billions per year, but it&#x27;s funded by a tax on the telecom industry.

We&#x27;re working on it at Meteor now too.<p>The way I look at it, as long as the server has the final say over the &quot;official&quot; value at any given time -- which seems to be the case here, and is true in all real apps I&#x27;ve seen up to the backend datastore&#x27;s ability to provide it -- you don&#x27;t really have a consistency or convergence problem.  You just have a UI problem.  It&#x27;s easy for the client to track both the latest official value and what the user is doing, and tell the server about the latter.  The only question is what to show the user while their action is still outstanding, and the answer may be different for different kinds of UI.  You may want to &quot;fake it till you make it&quot; (Meteor&#x27;s default, aka latency compensation) or show some kind of loading indicator.<p>What about conflicts?  Well, depending on your app, your options for how the server handles operations from the client include: they sometimes fail; they always succeed via &quot;last writer wins&quot; (good for a checkbox, say); they always succeed via operational transforms; or there is application-level conflict resolution that ropes in the user (implemented on top of the foregoing).<p>There&#x27;s a trend at the moment to view everything as a distributed system, but if you treat a client as a tool for viewing information and calling APIs, it seems a lot simpler.",1403028884

If the SSL is broken, the attacker can see through to all the messages the client is being sent, and decrypt whatever the client can decrypt.<p>Here&#x27;s the thing about why JS-in-webpage crypto is fundamentally useless. The purpose of cryptography is to, somehow, secure some sort of communication between two parties. Maybe it&#x27;s as tiny as a zero-knowledge proof, maybe it&#x27;s a full-on encrypted general-purpose channel like SSL/TLS provides that can send arbitrary data back and forth in real-time, maybe we&#x27;re trying to send small proofs of a message&#x27;s integrity via hashes or signatures, maybe we&#x27;re sending messages from our past self to our future self and want it safe in the meantime &quot;at rest&quot;, but crypto is always about some sort of communication between parties A and B (the traditional Alice and Bob, even in that last case Bob is just an older Alice wearing a mustache).<p>Web pages run in a sandbox in which they fundamentally become part of the server&#x27;s environment briefly. They&#x27;re just an extension of the server, and are essentially designed from top to bottom to ensure that the only thing a web page can access is what was sent by the same server. The only cookies a server can get are the ones it set. (Modulo some cross-internal-domain stuff, but it doesn&#x27;t change my point here.) The only requests it can manipulate are the ones it sent. The only resources the web page will access are ones the server tells it to. (Yes, a server can direct you to resources on other servers, and that&#x27;s actually a big deal, a big delegation of trust, and one of the trickiest corners of browser security.) The web browser forbids a page from the server from accessing the hard drive on its own, or accessing any other site&#x27;s stuff, etc. Structurally, the web page is just an adjunct to the server, by design, and anywhere this property fails is considered a security hole and fixed as quickly as possible. Without any ability to access any local resources that were not themselves originated from the server (i.e., HTML local storage doesn&#x27;t get you out of this, the server fully controls it), the web page has no independent identity to assert. It is totally in thrall to the server.<p>Note how I kept saying &quot;web page&quot;, and not &quot;web browser&quot;. There&#x27;s a big difference; web <i>browsers</i> are allowed to do a lot of things a web <i>page</i> is not. Pages have a distinct execution context and security policy different from the browser.<p>In the crypto sense, there&#x27;s no communication between a &quot;web server&quot; and the &quot;web page&quot;; it&#x27;s all just one system. The web <i>browser</i> may use SSL/TLS to communicate the necessary information to form a web page, but once that is done, the web <i>page</i> is deliberately put into a context where it is just an adjunct to a server, and there&#x27;s no distinct two parties with which to communicate anymore, from a crypto sense. This may seem counterintuitive, because we see messages flowing back and forth, but that&#x27;s all internal chatter, the <i>browser</i> functioning as an internal bus for the <i>page</i>/server unified security context. We have turned the full power of our cryptography and security research into making web <i>browsers</i> that enable web <i>pages</i> to function as extensions of the web <i>server</i>. It was and is not easy.<p>Further, what defines &quot;server&quot; is not the human word or concept, which can be distracting. What defines the &quot;server&quot; is <i>whatever finally produced the bytes that were used to create the web page</i>. If your <i>browser</i> isn&#x27;t using TLS/SSL, that turns out to be pretty must &quot;just whoever felt like serving some bytes to you&quot;. (If you don&#x27;t think that &quot;intercepting web requests&quot; is practical, it is. It&#x27;s off-the-shelf tech for hackers. Do not assume it is hard.) On the other hand, if SSL is properly used (and let&#x27;s skip over what that means and the validity of cert authorities, etc), then you do have assurance that the bytes came from your server without anybody in between, and the web <i>browser</i> is providing assurance to the web <i>page</i> that it is on an uninterrupted channel.<p>When not using <i>browser</i> crypto, it just doesn&#x27;t matter how you spin around; the attacker owns the web <i>page</i>, and you can&#x27;t do anything about it. And when I say &quot;own&quot;, I mean it, fully, the web page is actually functioning as an adjunct to <i>their</i> server, and you&#x27;re stuck with the results. It doesn&#x27;t matter what crypto you think you&#x27;re pushing to the user&#x27;s browser, because what&#x27;s actually happening is that the attacker is pushing <i>their</i> crypto to the user, and its relationship to what you inteded to push is entirely and solely up to their good graces, and by definition we&#x27;re pretty much talking about people without good graces. Without SSL, you have <i>ZERO</i> control over the user&#x27;s webpage, and the attacker has all of it. Unsurprisingly, there&#x27;s no crypto system that can survive that restriction.<p>When using <i>browser</i> crypto, SSL/TLS is providing you the maximum degree of assurance that is possible already that the channel is secure, more or less to the maximum extent the network will permit (i.e. attackers can observe byte flows or who you connect to and there&#x27;s not much that can be done about that). The argument that in-<i>page</i> crypto is useless amounts to the observation that this binary situation admits of no &quot;threading the needle&quot;, especially in light of the fact that without SSL being used we pretty much get to assume that an attacker can do absolutely <i>anything</i> to the data between the user and your server, and it&#x27;s pretty hard to construct a crypto system that can stand up to the attacker <i>arbitrarily manipulating it</i> on the way to user, which is what many people here are trying to do.<p>(Incidentally, clearly understanding the difference between the web <i>page</i> and the web <i>browser</i> is also important for understanding why this is particularly a problem for web pages and not so much other things. It&#x27;s because web pages go through so much effort to run in a sandbox such that the server doesn&#x27;t get any additional permissions it shouldn&#x27;t have via sending malicious web pages.)<p>(There&#x27;s a better blog post in here struggling to get out; this is my first attempt to put this in words. The server probably needs a page/server distinction too, for instance; the web page isn&#x27;t running with the full &quot;server&quot; privileges, of course, it&#x27;s actually also running as a &quot;page&quot; sort of thing too, where the browser and the server are collaborating to create a single unified security context hosted within the two of them.)",1403028732

Current culture is to handle these things inwardly and via some level of rational inquiry. We don&#x27;t need a turn-key replacement. The only turn-key replacement for religion is more religion. Religion as a category and part of human experience needs to be eliminated.  There&#x27;s nothing to fill past that point.<p>This is like saying, &quot;Now that we don&#x27;t have phrenology, we need a new phrenology.&quot; No, we just accept we can&#x27;t figure out how people work or what kind of people they are by feeling their skulls. We live with the ambiguity and use other tools to determine what people do via personality testing, statistics, psychology, etc which do not have the false certitude the pseudoscience of phrenology did the same way modern understanding of the world does not have the false  certitude that religion delivers.<p>>Gordon Gecko was a fictional villain in 1987 cinema<p>Gecko and non-fictional villains of that age were all baby boomer monotheists, if not extremely faithful churchgoers, and often justified their negative aspects via faith.

If you look at the Chinese news you see young people rebelling against the system every day and they become more. Also the government is not as strict and well organised as it was many years ago, when their tanks where fighting the student protesters. The Chinese government itself is fat, lazy and far away from the real life situation of most Chinese citizen.<p>I think the chances are not too low that there will be revolution kind of change. Maybe cultural, maybe not with weapons and that stuff. But the Chinese people know too much about the wealth of their rich comrades, of their big cities and of the western countries.",1322438394
3283788,comment,3283644,3283644,19,0,tabbyjabby,,,"Hmm. The author's recommendation to use Redis' 'KEYS' command to pattern match keys for invalidation is a dangerous one. 'KEYS' runs in O(n) time. If you're using Redis in a serious production environment, you do not want want to be using an O(n) command each time you need to invalidate a group of keys. It's better to group related items in a Redis hash table, and that way they are all stored under one common key.<p>Honestly, I think this article is a more impoverished version of antirez's post on the same topic [1]. antirez, being one of the principal authors of Redis, is a much more authoritative source, and he actually describes all the patterns that this author described in greater detail.<p>[1] <a href=""http://antirez.com/post/take-advantage-of-redis-adding-it-to-your-stack.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://antirez.com/post/take-advantage-of-redis-adding-it-to...</a>",1322438382

It turns out that employees at Google, Facebook, Mckinsey, Goldman Sachs, numerous hedge funds, and probably even some old-economy companies actually have quite a bit of freedom to do their jobs with creativity  and excellence.  Good managers don't try to <i>control</i> employees - they <i>manage</i> them, so that the employee's natural talents and inclinations are matched up to the needs of the organization.  And a manager at a fast-growing company probably got put in that position because somebody else thought he would do well at it, while a manager at a startup got that way because he hated his old job enough to quit.<p>There're certainly things wrong with big companies - I could probably name half a dozen areas where Google is dysfunctional and probably not fixable because the dysfunction is an emergent property of having 30,000 people work on a suite of products used by billions.

Whole, unprocessed grains do raise your blood sugar higher than processed grains, which is actually a good thing if it doesn't quickly cause a blood sugar spike. That's what bleached/processed flour does. It causes a quick spike in blood sugar, so in that respect processed flour is more like a candy bar. Whole grains also provide more fiber, complex carbs, and nutrients that processed grains have had removed.

I shouldn't have marked the repository or its corresponding HN post with ""Stop passing naked dictionaries around!  I must admit, my marketing impulse got the best of me there.  Naked dictionaries with untyped values are obviously one of Python's strengths, and the very <i>option</i> of using them instead of a heavier system is a big part of why dynamic languages are so important, both to me and to the craft as a whole.  It would be a more accurate reflection of my perspective if I had rather said ""Stop <i>always</i> passing naked dictionaries around, especially in cases where you have to write schema validators for them!""<p>Statically typed languages are a drag because you've got type checking always, and you don't always need it -- in fact, as any dynamic programmer knows, you almost never need it.[1]<p>But sometimes you do.  It's a fact that data schemas are useful at times.  In instances where your data is in fact naturally schemad,[2] Ill invoke some PEP 20 dogma of my own: Explicit is better than implicit.  There are situations in which you <i>could</i> catch a data problem at the time youre storing it, but with dictionaries you only catch it later, once its being used (hopefully your test coverage surfaces it, or it might not even happen until youve deployed to production).[3]  Recognizing this, you may then write a one-off schema validator for each of these situations, but that puts the onus on every developer to call that validator every time he or she is populating a dictionary of that classification (not very DRY).<p>In the six months or so since I wrote the first version, Ive found DStruct to be extremely useful for lots of scenarios, like remote resources (I just wrote a use case here: <a href=""https://gist.github.com/1398138"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/1398138</a>), mock objects (I just wrote a use case here: <a href=""https://gist.github.com/36118077f75eaed8c731"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/36118077f75eaed8c731</a>), future-proofing, backwards-compatibility, and pretty much any time youre doing outside-in development (e.g. writing a view or serializer first, and having it build up its own mock data objects, to be replaced by model instancesonce the model layer is complete).<p>In my heavily content-driven game framework, the game designer imports content via CSV.[4]  With DStruct and a handful of code changes (amounting essentially to `return Decoration(input_dict)` or `return LevelMilestone(input_dict)`,  instead of just `return input_dict`), we have been able to save enormous human time, because the server now detects schema-related content problems at content import time, rather than having to wait for the full content test suite to run (and hopefully have enough coverage that it can detect a missing or malformed attribute!).<p>I put it DStruct out there because it simply <i>kept on saving</i> me time, code, and technical risk in a variety of projects.  Everyone is free to take it or leave it, but my preference is that they fully understand it before doing so.<p>-dorkitude<p>PS: I don't come from Java; I'm a Pythonist born and raised (even way back at IMSA, where I believe we met once or twice ;)  I think in terms of metaprogramming, multiple inheritance, dynamic typing, and runtime mutation.  I understand the kneejerk ""oh god another Java bureaucrat"" reaction, because it's a reaction I myself feel when I see certain patterns being hamfistedly jammed into Python code.  DStruct is not such an occurrence.<p>[1] The debate about DStruct is not a debate dynamic vs. static typing in language design (were all pythonists here): it's a debate about the degree of the qualifier ""almost"" in this sentence.<p>[2] Sometimes youre mocking something thats schemad; sometimes the interface is beyond your control; sometimes youre retrofitting a class that used to be ORM and now is not; sometimes youre importing CSVs; sometimes youre writing a feed aggregator; the list of naturally schemad data sources goes on and on.<p>[3] This is particularly true in Ruby, where they always seem to use Hash-as-argument in an attempt to get the future-proofing power we get for free in Python via keyword args.<p>[4] And not just store items, settings, and game objects, but even the rules and economic structure!  The game framework referenced here is the best work of my career to date.   Unfortunately it is a closed source project, but suffice it to say the concepts baked into DStruct (and a handful of other killer libraries I will release in the coming year) had a significant positive effect in terms of code bloat, development time, quality, and risk.",1322436059

The only part of history that the people in SV startup land will become is the part of history where investors were throwing money at companies that had ideas with no products or execution or strategy for making money at all. We'll end up as the part of history that's remembered for I justified valuations, hype, and a huge busted bubble that ruins everything for the few companies that actually <i>are</i> worth funding. Most of the new trendy startups I've seen can be run on $50,000 a year max and I'm being generous. All you need is a server and some code, not a billion dollar valuation for a CRUD web app.<p>Very few startups are destined to be great or even decent. Very, very few. It's a shame that so many are getting so much hype without justification these days.",1322435020

Groupon inverts the laws of physics for her business.  Customer acquisition is no longer hard, gross margins are no longer $2 a cupcake.  A part of me sympathizes.",1322434957

Typically in the range of 5-10x the fee. One of the teams delivered something like 20x the fee in a project for the government.<p>And yes, that means that the client who payed 2 million USD to run a team actually got 40 million USD in payoff from this. This is of course an outlier, but it is still true. I have seen the details of this project myself (as it was a public engagement).<p>Why hasn't anyone heard of this? Because the glory of the successful projects are always given to the client executives/team.",1322434851

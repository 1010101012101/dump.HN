8147210,comment,8147128,8147128,3,0,seren,,,"My 2 cents.<p>You are stressed both from the new job and the pregnancy, and you are bit confused by what&#x27;s lying ahead. This is normal and would be weird if you were not reflecting on yourself at this time of your life.<p>Getting a child will in any case change your life rather dramatically, but this is really not such a big deal, many people have been there before, in a few weeks/months you&#x27;ll have adapted to the new normal. However, I don&#x27;t think it makes sense to try to change your situation right now. I would wait at least 15 months (pregnancy + some time to make some adjustments to your life). You&#x27;ll probably have a clearer view at that time of what is important to you, how is your new schedule. You will discover new priorities you can&#x27;t imagine or that you overestimate today. So the question is, are you ready to keep your job for another 15 months ?<p>The second point of your post seems to be your dissatisfaction with your new role, and that you can&#x27;t find your place in your new team.<p>>  Being the guy constantly trying to change how work get’s done makes people not like you. Which sucks.<p>It does not have to be this way. People tend to resist change because they are afraid of what is lying ahead, afraid of a loss of power or responsibility, etc. If you have been an expert on X for years, you are not really enthusiast if the whole team is moving to Y.<p>I would advise to read some books on change management: try to get the support from key stakeholders, identify why people are resisting change, try to find what would appease the reluctant one (training, promotion, etc), identify the early adopters, communicate your early success, etc. If you are really moving to Y, why not putting the expert on X in charge of the new technology ? Rather than seeing the change as a threat, it could become a great personal challenge.<p>If you show clearly to people what they will gain by changing in their everyday life : easier debugging, lesser cost, easier deployment, less hassle, etc , they will like you. You also need to tailor your discourse to your audience, the boss is likely not interested by the same thing than a developer. Also keep in mind that even if your new framework is the best technology ever, it does not mean that it will convince people. Convincing people to change is almost orthogonal to the technical merit of the solution.<p>Your job sounds pretty interesting! You might only be missing a few concepts/skills (or you are working with very grumpy people which is also possible) For what&#x27;s it worth, I am also trying to introduce new tools/technology in my bigCo SW team. It does not feel as bad as what you are describing, but I have the distinct feeling that I am sometimes considered as the crazy annoying guy (for trying to introduce things that have been mainstream for 10 years... whatever)<p>PS : Sorry for my spelling/grammar, I have only slept a few hours last night because of my newborn son. So it is likely worse than usual.",1407412625

You&#x27;d still be iterating through the list afterwards.<p>The system&#x27;s hands are somewhat tied, I think. The events are building up in kernel mode, so it can&#x27;t just switch to the callback for each one, not least because the callback might be executing already (possibly it was even the callback that caused whatever new event has been produced). So all it can do, when an event occurs, is add the event to a buffer - handling overflow (etc.) according to the options the caller set - though I don&#x27;t think a callback is practical as this would involve switching back to user mode - for later consumption by user mode code. In short, it&#x27;s building up a list, and perhaps the API could reflect that.<p>This is not to suggest that it would be easy to get to there from here. I&#x27;ve no doubt it could be literally impossible to retrofit an alternative API without rewriting everything. Just that I don&#x27;t see why in principle an event tracing API can&#x27;t work in some more straightforward fashion.",1407412334

8147128,story,,,11,11,bad-decision,"Ask HN: Took a new job, not happy, but baby is coming",,"I recently left a company (in April). While there I was in a senior engineer role, leading a team on very technically challenging products.  The work as described in the interview sounded challenging, interesting, and generally helpful.  In reality, its not challenging at all.<p>My title took a step down too.  Since it was a significant pay raise I figured it was a big company thing, However while working I&#x27;ve found others with similar responsibilities and pay grade with the a senior title.  Though it’s a small thing, it kind of bums me out.  I still haven&#x27;t updated my LinkedIn because I’m embarrassed by what feels like a step down.\nThe first month I was there, I cleared out the &quot;Summer backlog&quot; in a two week period.  As a result, I don&#x27;t feel like many on the team like me. People seem to begrudge that I’m bringing my small company pace to the team.  My boss though, seems pretty satisfied... he brought me to help on a new team.  He sold my new role as &quot;infrastructure guy&quot;, which sounded really great!  Designing better frameworks for the team to be more productive.  It&#x27;s something I’ve demonstrated that I’m good at, and he thought it could help the team.  The problem is the role so far has really been more of a technology sales role, than anything else.  Being the guy constantly trying to change how work get’s done makes people not like you.  Which sucks.<p>On the other hand my wife is 8 weeks pregnant.  So far it&#x27;s proven possible to leave your work at work.  As a former “my work is my life guy”, its an uncomfortable change. But may prove useful when I have a baby.  I live in one of the most expensive cities for childcare, and I don&#x27;t get the feeling I’d make my salary (or have the possible flex time) this company offers.  Basically, the benefits can&#x27;t be beat easily.<p>How do you balance, feeling like your career stopped, uncomfortable team dynamics, and a shitty commute with oncoming responsibilities?",1407411203

What it would require though is a russian working for FSB, maybe inspired by Snowden, he might even safely ask for asylum to US after such a leak.",1407410080

For most small content websites (< 500-1000 visitors a day), a shared hosting is sufficient with costs of maybe around 100 USD/year. For SSL, you usually need a more expensive hosting, you have to buy a certificate (OK, available for less than 10 USD if you don&#x27;t care about it&#x27;s quality but need mainly browser support without an ugly warning window) and most hosters allow SSL only for one domain in a hosting.<p>Example:<p>Shared hosting with 4 WordPress blogs, SSL is active but only to access the control panel since the hoster allows SSL only for one domain. Costs incl. a cheap SSL certificate: 110 USD/year.<p>All 4 WordPress blogs with SSL, i.e., 4 shared hostings plus 4 cheap SSL certificates: 440 USD/year.<p>(And caching with a Wordpress plugin is probably no longer possible …)",1407409762

The Xbox 360's CPU wasn't really used to its potential either, if you look at its theoretical numerical throughput compared to the actual throughput.<p>The GPU in the PS3 isn't as powerful as the Xbox 360's GPU, but there are a number of great libraries available that permit augmentation of the GPU with the SPUs.<p>From experience, architectures that are designed first for the PS3 run very well on the Xbox 360, but architectures that are designed for the Xbox 360 (or, worse, PC) will not perform well on the PS3, which punishes you for pointer chasing. The tile-based lighting in BF3 that you mention is interesting because the Xbox 360 CPU did not have enough horsepower to crunch the lighting data so they had to leverage the GPU to augment it. This was challenging because the Xbox 360 GPU was a DX9.0c+ era part and wasn't intended for GPGPU computation.

There was a big rush to restore from backups, and there was a small amount of data loss.<p>One thing that came out of the retrospective, requested by the engineer in question, was the <i>production hat</i>. Before you opened up a connection to a production machine, you had to put on the large pirate hat. You could only put it back when you had closed the connections. I didn't really need it, but it was a great way for people to learn the necessary caution.<p>It also ended up being a nice exclusive lock on futzing with production, and seeing it in use led to some good discussions that otherwise might not have happened. But the main thing was developing a strong differentiation of states in everybody's heads.",1361216818

Also having a sliding commission scale gives incentives to push sales through at whatever cost, just to get to the next tier of commission-- the difference is substantial. I've seen how this can lead salesmen to sell to fraudulent clients who use demo service or products (at a cost to the company)\nReducing or eliminating tiered commissions can help. If possible, applying penalties to salesmen who don't conduct due diligence to verify clients' identities, or penalties for cancelling a service before rescission periods end could help, too.<p>Yet, at the same time, I'm making a switch from tech to entrepreneur and I believe that sales is a lot about telling a story. In general, you have to make your clients believe your product or service is a great deal and that you don't make any money on the deal. (which is impossible)<p>So, how do you sell a product or service at a decent profit without becoming slimy? Or how do you run a company and give incentives (and disincentives) to employees that lead to both short and long term growth, customer satisfaction, employee satisfaction and sustainable profit?<p>Good question.

GPU is worse there than in xbox360, but there are 6 SPUs. OTOH writing for them is far from a pleasant task. You have to perform manual fiddling with DMA stuff. Slow bus, async requests to 64k cache (IIRC), where you must send everything and get results via DMA some time later, 64k load max, so you must do partial screen updates, syncs, etc. That makes the whole execution path in PS3 quite different from other platforms. To see good-looking PS3 games, you have to look for games developed exclusively for PS3. PS3 ports always look worse, because no one devotes at least 2x more time for them to write ""proper"" renderers etc. Middle-level psgl is not recommended by Sony itself, as you should use gcm, where you manually put bytecode to GPU's memory being command buffer. And for SPU asm is the way to go...<p>tl;dr PS3 is not the most developer-friendly platform, you can say...<p>But it has its own potential. Check Naughty Dog's Uncharted.

That seems like a fairly good deal to me--a crude approximation of saying 'you only pay for your degree if you get financial value from it'.<p>> This whole thing is a bizarre contradiction to me.<p>I agree that education is a special case within international trade.

I don't find it at all bizarre or morally perverse that the PM should act as a cheerleader for influential domestic interests such as our higher education system, especially when full fee-paying international students effectively subsidise UK students. And I've never seen Cameron say he wishes to reduce the number of fee-paying foreign students attending accredited UK institutions.<p>And a also disagree with the implication in your comment that the UK general taxpayer subsidies higher education too little. More higher education than a free market would provide is beneficial, but after a certain point the net benefit to society of the next marginal student buying subsided education would be less than the added public benefit. If you watch the front page of HN, there's occasionally an article or two about a higher education bubble; people are (probably) already buying more education (and certainly in some sectors if not others) than the job market can stand.<p>I like the idea of free education as a 'right', naturally or socially constructed. But moving towards that reality in Britain has to come from innovation slashing the marginal cost of education, and in the short term, by increasing the number of full fee-paying foreign students. Allocating revenue or large tax rises to up the number of students in higher education are going to be politically infeasible for at least a generation.

I do think that there are too many people here who think too highly of themselves. This leads to insecurity and bashing others. I don't pay attention to it, though. Too many great things here to even waste a second on that. Sometimes, when the thread does turn into a negative train, I try and break it off.",1361214070

First, it can pinpoint exactly when something started happening, which in this situation might have helped you realize the problem was caused by your change.  Secondly, in this specific situation it probably would have been easier to differentiate a situation where you are running low on memory vs this completely different situation.<p>As somebody who spent a lot of time professionally debugging large software systems when they were misbehaving (as a Google SRE), I can tell you that looking at graphs of many key metrics (disk IO, CPU, memory, then application specific things) was always the place to start when debugging a situation, because you can learn so many things right away.  When did it start?  Was it a slow buildup or an immediate thing?  What is the general problem (Memory?, Disk IO?, CPU?, none of the above?)?  Has a similar pattern happened in the past?<p>Then you can start to get fancy and plot things like ""messages/minute"" or something and then it becomes easy to see when issues are affecting the site performance and when they aren't.",1361214063

This time I see none of that, it's off-the-shelves current hardware. Feels weird. AMD platforms are good on heavily multithreaded code, I hope that game devs will be able (with the help of a nice lib or not) take advantage of that.",1361214041

I need to talk to the duck,"" and they know this means I'm going to talk to their head but they can basically keep doing what they're doing and nod occasionally.<p>This serves several purposes:<p>(1) It's less insane-sounding than actually talking to an inanimate object in an open work environment.<p>(2) It actually feels better and forces me to think more clearly when I'm talking to an actual person -- the cognitive focus is higher when the object of conversation can actually, in theory, think and talk back (YMMV).<p>(3) And finally, although it does require <i>some</i> focus on the part of the other coder, it's not nearly as taxing to them as actually helping me solve the problem or pairing up with me.<p>So it's a good compromise somewhere between pair programming and talking to an actual rubber duck. Again, YMMV. Maybe I'll call it ""Pair Ducking.""",1361214035

I imagine that some of them have gone more than a week without giving a shit about HN, but not all of them at once. So I think there is <i>doing things better in the future</i>.

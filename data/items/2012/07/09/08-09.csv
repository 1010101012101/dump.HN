For me it was about the (self-guided) achievements and challenges: I wasn't ""hacking a way to a solution,"" and would often return to the same problem and solve it again and again, never ""falling back to really hacky solutions to get things done.""

This is separate and distinct protection from what scrypt/bcrypt gives you.<p>[Edit] In a typical GPU accelerated brute force attack, the target hash and salt are both known as fixed 20 or 32-byte values, and you iterate through candidate passwords until you find a match.<p>In the proposed technique, the target hash is NOT known! Instead, what you do know is a salt and a list of a few billion hashes, ONE of which can be obtained by combining the salt with some unknown password.  This is a very different equation, and I believe, much harder to solve, since your target value can't just be kept in a register or L1 cache for comparison purposes.",1341823935

Who looks to newspapers for the latest stock market performance, restaurant reviews, or movie showtimes?""</i><p>Guess that question was rhetorical, but I'm going to answer it anyway:<p>I do! (well, maybe not movie showtimes)<p>There are many reasons I prefer an old-school newspaper for <i>some</i> things:<p><pre><code>  - I already spend every waking hour looking at screens,   \n    paper is a nice break. Paper has some nice qualities too.\n\n  - Easier to read on a crowded subway than a pad [1], \n    no need to charge them, lighter, I throw it away when \n    I'm finished with it so I don't have to carry it around \n    all day\n  \n  - I hate most online newspapers: 80% adds, shitty design,\n    seems to emphasise short stories to drive page views.\n  \n  - Sometimes it's important that the news a ""fresh"",\n    and of course on-line wins there. But more often, the \n    stuff I read does not suffer much from being a few \n    hours old [2].\n</code></pre>\n1 - I suspect.. they might be bigger but they are also soft and ""bendable"", and they don't break when that guy with the huge backpack turns and smashes it into you.<p>2 - Here in Scandinavia online news became popular early, and the newspapers have had more time to adapt to the threat/opportunity. I suspect this affects what they put in the paper editions.<p>(edit: formatting)",1341823915

Though the author tries to give opposite instances, he has put most of his effort and emotion into painting a bad picture. If this is the median, whats the bad side :-)?<p>The original article is not factual (no one is allowed on the tarmac in any airport, its a security risk, and India has known terrorism long before it became a word in the U.S), but my sympathies are with the emotion behind the article. Visiting India can be genuinely overwhelming and the cognitive dissonance can drive someone crazy without some level of apathy towards people still living penniless on the street.<p>My suggestion to the author, try to see if there is someway he can help, either with his skills or money. And no, ""thinking up ways I can help"", is not the same. Charity is alive and well in India and though life is too hectic here to help in kind (by volunteering etc), most people help with money, facilities and simple deeds like giving business to people who want to make a living e.g. there are mega malls and big stores in most metros, but many people I know make it a point to give business to the street-side hawkers, small businesses and vendors on a daily basis so that their work is supported.<p>Now that you have had the time to vent, lets get stuck into actually doing something.",1341823360

So BlackBerry's time is truly up. This is reflected now in RIM's publicly available finances - the fiscal reality simply lagged behind market sentiment by a couple of years, that's all.<p>I will make a wager: in 3 years you should go back to South America and Australia - I'm willing to bet that RIM's market share in those countries will resemble Blackberry's market share in North America today.",1341822640

Amount of financial transactions in average bank is tremendous, and unless you know exactly what to look for it's beyond shadow of possibility to make sense of all of this data and see if there's any problem somewhere there. You'd need regulatory agencies with personnel 10 times more than whole personnel  of all banks. Who'd pay for that?<p>2. It's not a question of budgets. Somehow some people got the idea money is all-powerful and enough money solves any problem. That's BS. Nobody knows that. And yes, bankers don't know that too - do you think they enjoy being nearly bankrupt? If they could properly predict such things, they would. They can't, however, so instead they do what they can - dance on the line as long as they can and cry for help when the time comes.<p>3. Yeah, right. And who will be determining ""merits"", you? No, thanks. I'd rathe take my chance with the stupid hordes - at least they are not so swollen with self-importance as to deny everybody who disagrees with them basic human rights of self-rule and control over their own destiny. All these arguments that some people should be slaves ""for their own good"" and have no rights except the right to be ruled by kind masters - we are way past that. Sorry, those times won't return, abandon that dream.<p>4. Nationalized industries work really great, duh. Of course, being controlled by the state gives people superpowers, so industry that was badly managed and corrupt as private, of course will become clean and well-managed as government enterprise. After all, government enterprises are universally known for their excellent management and total lack of corruption, especially when it comes to managing billions of dollars. Duh.<p>>> The root of all social problems is the fact that the most qualified and knowledgable academics and technologists have zero political power, while Chrstian pseudo-preachers hold all of it.<p>This is completely stupid and false. The social problems have multiple roots, and very little of them have anything to do with technologists and academics having little power. Academics, technologists and social engineers of all kids have huge powers and access to enormous budgets and overwhelming regulatory powers. Most of their social engineering enterprises, however, meet with disastrous results, exactly because every complex problem has cheap, obvious, easy to understand wrong solution. And people like you grab at it and yell ""oh, that's simple, let's nationalize all banks and appoint more bureaucrats to run financial industry, that would guarantee us eternal prosperity"". No, it won't, sorry.<p>The ""idiots"" are acting exactly in their self-interest when they are ignoring advice like yours - because what you are advising is a recipe for disaster and this was proven by history many times.

Company would spend too much time evaluating the idea before deciding whether to put resources into it.\n2. Company would assign a team to work on it, led by Jack.  Abilities of team would vary wildly.\n3. Jack's team would have to run everything through company I.T. which means hosted servers and more paperwork.\n4. Jack's project would be expected to show results immediately and be commercialized swiftly, not 5 years after launch like with Twitter.\n5.

Next best is time spent as a Dutch, British, or French colony.

Fundamentally it’s a messaging protocol where you don’t specify the recipients. It’s really more of a discovery than an invention; that square was always there in the periodic table of protocols, but no one had quite hit it squarely.</i><p>We could try to draw a small excerpt of this 'periodic table':<p><pre><code>              LONG    SHORT\n  ONE:ONE     email   im/sms\n  ONE:PUBLIC  blogs   twitter\n</code></pre>\nOf course, the axes aren't exact. You can write arbitrarily short emails and blogposts, and lengthy IMs. Twitter is usually 'public' but only viewed by some set of friends/acquaintances/fans, and interactions range from chatty conversations to long lagged correspondences. Each box bleeds into the others with crossover communications.<p>But you get the idea; the signature modes of each big success are variations on a theme, nailing a new permutation. And it shouldn't be surprising that blogging pioneers happened upon the adjacent twitter opportunity at the right time.<p>You could build similar tables where an axis-of-contrast is EPHEMERAL/ARCHIVED, or BUSINESS/PLEASURE, or TEXT/AUDIOVISUAL, or REALTIME/TIME-LAGGED, or SIMPLE/POWERFUL, and see some of the same things appear in the quadrants, or other familiar services, or gaping holes -- where there may be Twitter-sized opportunity waiting.",1281219845

To understand the need they fill think of what would be the alternative if they didn't exist. Email, chat, and RSS don't really fill that gap.<p>And yes, this is probably not the kind of thing that you plan. They probably came across it in the course of trying many different things and then realized how powerful it was. A lot of inventions happen that way. That's why I think Google's concept of lettings engineers use 20% of their time to experiment is brilliant.<p>Twitter grew big because they had two key components. Something that people wanted, and a really good growth channel which is when bloggers started promoting them on their blogs to get more followers.

This means that the base product is still the <i>same</i> as it has always been; they're not, as 37 Signals would put it, dying with their user base.<p>In summary, Twitter serves many purposes and it does it in a fashion that it doesn't get in your way.",1281219345

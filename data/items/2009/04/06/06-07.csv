548469,comment,547952,548342,0,0,timr,,,"Nice post.  (For the record, the simplification is understandable...I got my PhD in this stuff, so I'm not exactly the target audience.)<p>I agree that convergent evolution of protein folds seems unlikely to have happened frequently, but I'm not willing to dismiss it as impossible over the course of evolutionary time-frames.  More importantly, I'm not willing to extend that idea to the conclusion that all protein folds must have been extant at the beginning of evolutionary history.  There are simply too many ways for new protein folds to be produced -- and not necessarily by stepwise point mutations through stable intermediates.<p>You're right that PFAM isn't a structural classification system <i>per se</i>; they do what you describe a bit later, and build massive sequence profiles to detect homologies.  But at the sequence identity levels used to build PFAM, you can safely assume that any sequence within a family that has a solved structure will probably share that structure's overall fold.  The details will be different, but the fold will be conserved.  That's really the point of PFAM (and why it has a symbiotic relationship with SCOP).<p>But here's the problem with drawing too many structural conclusions from sequence analysis:  with state-of-the art algorithms, we can detect structural homologies out to about 25-30% sequence identity.  Beyond that, we just don't know how to call two structures ""similar"" or ""dissimilar"", without having the structures themselves.<p>Point being, you can't really say that those 800-1300 ""roots"" of the evolutionary tree are independent starting points.  All you can conclude is that our tools aren't good enough (or there isn't enough data) to trace back the evolutionary tree to the point where those ""roots"" may have converged.<p>For the record, I'm not trying to be pendantic or argumentative.  This is one of those few fun debates that makes the field interesting. ;-)",1239000465

Most intelligent people I've met agree that fighting the ability to copy content has no future.  Distributors may not be dead yet, but they are in the ER hooked up to monitors, with lawyers running around trying to defibrillate them with lawsuits.<p>For the most part they can't change either, because they are often under contract to provide content to certain channels and certain times, so they can't just start offering a pay or advertising based torrent service.<p>In terms of producing movies, music or other kinds of content, the only real value that remains in the studio model is financing.  That is, someone pays to make your movie based on how excited you can make them in 10 minutes.  With distribution being replaced, there may yet be a business model in production financing.

The main character has to ""grow"" throughout the film while facing what are essentially adult problems - using animation as the vehicle for story telling.</i><p>I think that can be said about most stories with a non-tragic hero.<p><i>Dreamworks animations are aimed directly at children because of this influence, the stories are often not as complex and the jokes are simpler.</i><p>Of the several PDI/Dreamworks films I've seen, I would say they are at the same complexity level as Pixar's stories. These stories usually have a couple of layers of depth to them, and you only need to follow the obvious one to get the main points. In my opinion, the Dreamworks films are not articulated as well (in both plot and characterizations) as the Pixar films and actually end up feeling more convoluted.<p>I first saw Toy Story as a child. Looking back on it as an adult, I remembered that I had a pretty good grasp on the plot and characters as a kid, so I was assuming it had been a simplistic film. When I watched it again, I saw lots of things I didn't notice as a kid.<p><i>Their marketing teams absolutely blitz the public and this is probably why Shrek 2 is still the highest grossing animated film of all time, even though several films from both studios are better.</i><p>Definitely.<p><i>Now if the NY Times really wants to make an article about Pixar's future success, they should perhaps write about how the next few films after UP won't be directed by Pixar's main stable of directors (Stanton, Lasseter, Bird and Docter) instead seeing a generational change with new directors handling old franchises.</i><p>True. One thing Pixar has going for them is that they haven't made any movies even close to bad. I would say that they haven't even made any movies that aren't <i>great</i>. (Though I'm kind of on the fence about <i>Cars</i>.) They've built up a pretty solid momentum now, and it would take a series of bombs (like Disney after the mid-90s) to shake it.<p>The people getting upset about Up not being as marketable as past Pixar films will have to get over it. If you're going to get great creative types together and have them make stuff, you have to give them freedom â€“ otherwise you end up like PDI/Dreamworks.

To get started building interactive prototypes, you can draw first and flesh it out later, vs. learn how to draw in markup/code and then learn how to glue it together.<p>Some of my earliest memories of finding real accomplishment in programming were using Visual C++ and Visual Basic. While I had written a ton of absolute crap in BASIC and C before, the toy projects were relegated mostly to scripts and whatever text or ANSI interfaces I could dream up. I felt like I had made something accessible to other people. Also, my UI design skills got 1000 times better when I had an easy, accessible way to approach user-oriented design simultaneously with the behavior, and it helped me better learn how to divide my code up in ways that made sense.",1450411096

You break a piece of data up into 20 pieces and create 20 extra parity pieces. Now you only need 20 out of the 40 to recreate the original data.<p>Are we encoding the encrypted data? Ok well we need at least 20 good pieces, and that&#x27;s to decode the original data. This method doesn&#x27;t allow for seamless degradation but allows for some data loss in the transmission (while effectively doubling the amount we&#x27;re trying to push in the first place).<p>Let&#x27;s say we&#x27;re breaking up the original data, creating parity pieces and encrypting each little piece. Then it could decrypt each piece it got and use it and if it couldn&#x27;t decrypt a piece just throw it away. This could potentially work but parity pieces are useless unless you are trying to recreate the original file neglecting the ability to degrade quality. So redundancy is more important in this scenario than parity.<p>But, if we make the encrypted pieces small enough, say each packet body, then that could probably work but be resource intensive. Encode/decode every packet, if successful insert into feed, else throw the packet away. This would work a lot like the existing technology just requiring some middle step of decrypting each packet body.",1450410878

Probably because the success part of getting people to use something isn&#x27;t as formulaic as building something. I quit my career in chemical engineering because I wanted that structure of the computer. The mess of how chemicals react drove me nuts. And then I just find myself in the mess of human psychology and &quot;chemistry&quot; :) Oh well.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, even with this non-tech, hand wavey stuff, I try and share as much tactic and followable strategy as I can. That point in here about asking &quot;Can I buy you a virtual cup of coffee&quot; that worked so well. Everyone I&#x27;ve emailed with that subject line has opened that email and taken me up on it. Got some great meetings.<p>But still at the end, there&#x27;s no guarantee those meetings will create any immediate wealth. But like I said earlier, from so much of life I feel like most of us who have the capability to get on a computer and read this stuff on this message board, eventually we can figure out an angle to making money from the stuff we want to.<p>It&#x27;s not maybe exactly your dream but I keep finding ways to make it work. For example, maybe your software product just doesn&#x27;t turn out to be the SaaS app you get 1000 people paying $100 a month for. But with enough giving up, trying some new variation, testing again, we find what does sell. Maybe it&#x27;s selling licenses as one off installs for big banks, or doing consulting in the same domain. If you love the domain of your product, there&#x27;s so much room for the actual original product idea to suck, but find something tangential that you still love to work on.<p>And those books I mention in the article about Blue Ocean Strategy and Something Really New are mind opening on how to design a product. Draft was all about analyzing tasks we have as writers and removing steps. It wasn&#x27;t overnight, but was a key way I thought about the product design that led to some great usage.",1450410721

I learnt exactly how you surmised by using view source on existing websites.<p>As a 13 year old kid who was mildly curious I was able to build a web site for my high school by hand in &#x27;pure&#x27; html code. It looked laughably simple compared to the web pages of today but it was easy. I can and did teach many other people to make websites the same way.<p>Nowadays it seems to me like you don&#x27;t have a hope in hell of hand writing a website (maybe some people still do seem like an exercise in frustration to me). Everything is all frameworks and scripting languages.<p>Earlier this year 20 years after I wrote html pages for my school&#x27;s web site I had cause to write some HTML again. I work as an engineer (the non software type) in an industrial plant. I needed to display some non critical data to our plant operators on a screen in the control room. I thought &#x27;hey I&#x27;ll put it on a web page&#x27;. It would save me from having to mess around with C which is what our HMI system is written in. So I built something using 1990&#x27;s era HTML mostly from my memory (although I did move on to using tables instead of frames) It worked.<p>A few weeks later some one asked to make it possible to view historical results so I built a simple html form (also 1990&#x27;s era technology) to allow user to input the date range he wanted to view results from. It worked but did no input validation was finicky about the format you enter dates into it etc...<p>A few weeks later I decided I&#x27;d modernise it - modern websites have things like popup calendars which allow the user to &quot;pick&quot; a date instead of having to type dates into a text field. I found a framework written in javascript which provided those sorts of things and attempted to use it. Seemed to work but a lot of subtle bugs kept popping up.<p>When you clicked on a date in the calendar such as 12th of January the framework passed it to the form in US style 01-12-2015 format I live in Australia we use 12-01-2015 as out date format. I could find no way to change the way the framework functioned. I searched google and a few other people complained about the same issue seemed to be no solution. I thought I&#x27;d dig into the javascript file try to edit the program to provide date in format I needed it to be in. The file was &#x27;minified&#x27; impossible to read javascript.

Winning challenges of acquiring wealth or political power or popularity are related to intelligence, insofar as the concept of intelligence is defined (as it is at least in psychology) as the ability to accomplish general goals.<p>Walking into a meeting of the Deutsche Arbeiterpartei, joining as the 55th member, and later seizing control of the state requires intelligence. Landing in a dingy yacht with 81 men, bleeding a regime to death, and ruling it until your death requires intelligence. Buying the rights to the Quick and Dirty Operating System, licensing it to IBM, and becoming the de facto standard OS for all consumer computing requires intelligence. Presenting yourself as a folksy Texan when you&#x27;re a private-school elite from Connecticut and convincing the electorate that you&#x27;d have a beer with them requires intelligence. All of these outcomes are goals, and accomplishing them demonstrates an ability to actually put the rubber to the road.<p>You&#x27;re confusing the technical term of intelligence, which means something along the lines of &quot;ability to accomplish goals,&quot; with the social construct of &quot;intelligence&quot; which means something along the lines of &quot;ability to impress people.&quot; Intelligence is not always impressive, and humans have a fantastic ability to write off the accomplishments of others when they want to make the world appear more just. I mean, nobody feels good about the fact that we&#x27;re one Napoleon away from a totally different world system that may or may not suit our interests. The belief that the world is somehow fundamentally different to the extent that the next Napoleon-class intelligence who isn&#x27;t content managing a hedge fund and just increasing an int in a bank database can&#x27;t actually redraw the world map, is just an illusion we tell ourselves to make the world we live in more fair, the stories we live out more meaningful, and the events of our lives have a little bit more importance.<p>AI could change things very, very drastically. It&#x27;s right to be afraid.",1450410277

Unix caught on because it was (initially) available for free with source code. It was freely available at the time because the Bell System, as a regulated monopoly, was prohibited from getting into the software business. Universities loved it as an object of study, and it spawned many derivatives, also freely available. After the breakup of Bell, they started marketing Unix.<p>Plan 9 in contrast was not released for free, had restrictive licensing, because Bell Labs was now under AT&T. I think it is hard to overstate the impact of this difference.<p>Linux became popular first because it was free, and because it invited hacking, and then because the combination of these caused a snowball effect.<p>I would like to add that Plan 9 is in fact very compelling, but the advantages are maybe hard to appreciate.

Or if they get lucky and happen to find the right SHA256 hash, they will get outpaced on the <i>next</i> block (the Bitcoin protocol specifies that clients should assume the longest chain is correct), and the rest of the network will ignore their fraudulent transaction.<p>What&#x27;s the alternative in private blockchains?  I&#x27;m genuinely curious; I have little invested in Bitcoin, but I did spend some time understanding how the protocol works and why it includes the features it does.",1450408315

Let&#x27;s say we&#x27;re so far from thinking, human-intelligence machines that we&#x27;ll probably see super-intelligence coming long before it&#x27;s a threat. And be ready with solutions.<p>Plus, from what I see, the problem reduces to a form of computer security against a clever, malicious threat. You contain it, control what it gets to learn, and only let it interact with the world through a simplified language or interface that&#x27;s easy to analyse or monitor for safety. Eliminate the advantages of its superintelligence outside the intended domain of application.<p>That&#x27;s not easy by any means, amounting to high assurance security against high-end adversary. Yet, it&#x27;s a vastly easier problem than beating a superintelligence in an open-ended way. Eliminate the open-ended part, apply security engineering knowledge, and win with acceptable effort. I think people are just making this concept way more difficult than it needs to be.<p>Biggest risk is some morons in stock trading plug greedy ones into trading floor with no understanding of long-term disruption potential of clever trades it tries. We&#x27;ve already seen what damage the simple algorithms can do. People are already plugging in NLP learning systems. They&#x27;ll do it with deep learning, self-aware AI, whatever.

The riders split the cost between them.<p>uberHOP is like a bus service -  uses designated pickup locations and matches people going on similar routes. It costs riders a flat fee of $5 for each ride. \nDifference between uberHOP & uberPOOL - uberPOOL does not require riders to walk to pre-determined locations, instead having drivers pick up passengers at their exact location. The cost is variable and not a flat fee. For uberHOP riders have to walk to a predetermined spot (something like a bus stop).<p>uberCOMMUTE is less formal than the other two carpooling options and is designed for everyday people (ex. an office goer) that want to share space in their car. In other words, one temporarily becomes an uber driver when they are driving to their office.

I realized this very thing myself in the second year in high school. I thought: what the hell am I doing trying to get good grades—from every subject?<p>I had been doing precisely that <i>just because I could</i> and with the eerie awareness of the fact that I would forget 95% of anything deemed uninteresting right after the course. When it came to subjects tangential to my interests, I realized that I was certainly not going to learn something in school that I couldn't learn by myself.<p>If I ever needed to cross check which European country invaded which other European country in the 1600's, how to translate ""dear girl, I want to marry you for the rest of my life"" to German should the opportunity arrive, or desperately need to exercise in some molecular calculations, then I was convinced that I would still have the chance to learn that stuff.<p>Except for the subjects of my interest, I then dropped all my effort to the very, very minimal level and as a result my grades dropped slightly. It was probably the 20% of effort, 80% of results scheme in action. In some subjects that I had decided to completely ignore, like religion courses (yes, we had those in Finland...), I let my grades drop to the minimum that was required to avoid flunking and was actually pretty proud of that result.<p>I graduated with good grades in everything I cared about. My high school diploma then exhibited real value for the period of a mere month until it claimed its purpose and I got accepted to the university. I've never needed it after that.<p>And, by the way, except for mathematics, 99% of what I learned in high school I have never ever needed since. I'm 32 now and I'm glad my teenage realization turned out to be correct.",1280921635

This is not at all obvious because it just looks like header text and not a call to action.  Add a button that says ""sell your books"" or something like that.<p>And, final words that are probably the most important:<p>Your sites needs user to be useful, and nobody will join if it's not useful.

Most other mammals also feed their offspring in plain view of others of their species, which means there is plenty of opportunity to observe how it is done.  In human cultures, we debate the morality of -- gasp! -- breastfeeding in public.  When it is done in public at all, it is handled very discretely so no one gets a glimpse of someone's breast or, god forbid, nipple.

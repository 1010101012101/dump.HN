4857756,comment,4857290,4857641,2,0,merijnv,,,"I disagree, benefitting from 48 cores on the SCC would be easy, if the other (solvable) problems plaguing the SCC wouldn't get in the way. The bigger issues plaguing the SCC were:<p>The use of old P54C core, while understandable from hardware point (design already existed, no need to validate/test) this decision has big consequences. The core can only support a single outstanding memory operation, crippling memory performance. Doubly so because it does not support out-of-order execution, meaning the core is stalled until memory requests finish.<p>Furthermore, the lack of L2 cache consistency lets you experiment nicely with NUMA and the combination of reprogrammable lookup tables and more physical memory than address space (34 bit vs 32 bit) lets you do nice tricks to share/communicate data between cores with zero copying needed. Unfortunately (due to time/budget constraints) Intel didn't implement any programmable expiration/invalidation/flushing of the L2 cache. This means that any application wanting to use these tricks had no solution beyond reading in a full 256KB (with the proper striding to make sure you actually cache miss on all of those 256KB!) to flush the cache. Such a flush takes approximately 500k CPU cycles, almost guaranteed killing any performance gained from zero copy tricks.<p>The fact that cores were 32bit is also extremely, as you quickly consume your entire address space when you start playing around with the above mentioned sort of memory shenanigans.<p>There were some more fairly minor issues, but these are the ones that initially pop in my head.",1354373503

Which is perfectly reasonable.<p>It isn't perfectly reasonable. Life expectancy in 1910 was 48 for men, and 51 for women. The average age for heart attacks today is 66 for and 70 for women. Some, but not all of that is infant mortality, yes, but the fact is that if people in 1910 had less heart disease than people today, it is likely largely because people in 1910 often didn't long enough for heart disease to become a problem.<p>And that's just one factor that the comparison fails to control for. The way people lived and ate in 1910 was completely different from the way people lived and ate in 2000, and it is quite likely that those changes simply overwhelm the change with respect to one particular kind of saturated fat. That doesn't mean that butter fat is harmless. It just means that you can't see the harm if you also change <i>everything else</i>.<p>As a side note, where are these statistics about heart disease in 1910 coming from? We get the top-level URL for dietheartpublishing.com (which is low on data, high on sensationalist paleo-quackery), but no link to specific data. Are we relying on what doctors were able to diagnose in 1910? Because that's a whole other level of flawed.<p>>I've tried several things they recommend, and the vast majority of the practice checks out (regardless of the theory behind it).<p>What you think you've experienced through personal trials is not significant evidence.",1354373350

Developers choose the tools that work best for them - for instance, we have a mix of Linux, Windows, and Mac workstations in the team. We are adopting and adapting agile development techniques such as test-driven development, pair programming, and continuous integration. We hold regular retrospectives to improve our working environment and lightning talks to share cool ideas whether work-related or not. We expect developers to be generalising specialists, ready at the drop of a hat to refine an algorithm, write a tricky integration test, tune a SQL query, or discuss feature nuances with a product manager. Our team is growing fast and we'd like to hear (at careers@secretsales.com) from any of you who'd like to join us; we're hiring for all technical roles.<p>Established in London in July 2007, Secretsales.com is one of the UK's leading private shopping clubs, offering limited-time online sales with current name-brand goods at deep discounts.

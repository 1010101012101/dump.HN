It&#x27;s based mostly on my common needs, but I hardly think they are too specific -- yes, it&#x27;s an opinionated project.<p>This is my attempt to create a baseline for small webapps that quickly bundle the common ecosystem tools available. I&#x27;ve been digging the web for some related projects and it&#x27;s sort of a compendium of tools. \nMy idea was to reduce the code needed to it&#x27;s minimum, keeping it as much declarative as possible.<p>It was baked using modern tools such as: Composer, Slim, PhpUnit, Leesc, Mustache.php<p>Althoug it&#x27;s a work-in-progress, I would love to get some feedback.",1381593595

6539147,comment,6538833,6538833,1,0,tenpoundhammer,,,"This has been a popular point lately. I wonder if it is a reflection of our current tool set around architecture and design. It seems realistic that implementing a &quot;simple&quot; new feature should not be inordinately costly, I don&#x27;t dare to claim it should be a one to one relationship, but the current ratio seems out of control.<p>I believe as the software industry increases it&#x27;s understanding of architectural design that we will learn to add most types of features, in a systematically less costly way. Making them easier to maintain,update, and detangle from the rest of the software.<p>In fact, I am finding that we are just now arriving at that point with functional languages. Not that functional is our savior, but it does provide a good set of tools for this particular problem.<p>To wrap this up, I don&#x27;t think software needs less code and less features. I think it needs better tools and methodologies with which to deal with creating, updating, and maintaining features and complexity.",1381593579

When I was younger I used to look at my friends to tell me what their opinions were. Now that I&#x27;m older I form my own opinions. That means I value people who take the time to create and publish their thoughts. If those people do it all for free? I still value it, but the quality of the transaction goes down. See, for instance, all the Yelp problems, the fake Amazon reviews, and so on.<p>Google pays about .000001 for you to post your opinion on something. It makes about .0001 from it. I don&#x27;t have a problem with this math. I&#x27;m much more concerned with what it says about the human species than people making money. Are we so lost that we need constant reassurance from others on how to live, what opinions to have, what things to buy? As Schmidt said, do we really just want Google to tell us what to do?<p>I really don&#x27;t need 99% of the crap online. I need food, shelter, and medical care. That&#x27;s about it. The rest of it is all discretionary crap. I&#x27;m not sure we have to monetize discretionary spending advice. The web is mostly free. Why not just allow people to publish their own opinions using their own hardware and have protocols to share it all? Why do I need all these third-party services just to communicate?<p>You either draw the line somewhere or eventually you end up with cranial implants produced and owned by Apple sharing your every emotion and opinion with the rest of the world -- while they make money from it.

FrameMaker allowed you to do ad hoc formatting, but it was designed for a stylesheet approach. ... It is possible to pop open a style inspector in Word and use that instead, but it feels like an afterthought.</i><p>How long has it been since you used Word?  The styles are now right on the Home tab in the Ribbon.  On my monitor, it takes up over half the width of the Ribbon.  You don&#x27;t have to &quot;pop open&quot; anything to use styles, but you do need to open the styles palette to define and change styles.<p>A publisher could supply a Word template to its authors, and forbid the author to make any other formatting changes.  They could also enforce this by opening the styles inspector and checking for any unauthorized formatting.<p>An author could also apply a different stylesheet to reformat a text to match a different publisher&#x27;s stylesheet.<p>Word is a styles-based word processor, internally.  If you boldface some text, Word will create a new anonymous style that&#x27;s simply the existing style, plus boldface.  You could even use the styles inspector to change all instances of that anonymous style back to the original style, or to turn it into a named style.<p>You can use Word like Framemaker (sans frames) if you want.

If you plan to stay in one place for a long time then there is a lot to be said for buying and methodically paying down the mortgage.<p>Internet experts analyze home ownership as an economic decision, using their personal beliefs about economics and investment theories, as well as the perspective of their extremely limited life spans. &quot;What is true for my 32 years on the planet whilst breathing the air of Texas must be a Universal Truth for all sentient beings.&quot; I exaggerate slightly.<p>The point is, you are alive once. You are you. Owning a home is an important meta-message to your brain about who you are.  Use that to your benefit.<p>At one point in my life I had to be told rather abruptly to just stay put for a decade.  That mattered and it helped me immensely. I now have six years to go until my youngest child finishes high school. Things may change then. But the personal benefits of staying out have been immense.<p>So my suggestion to you is that your grandmother may be talking about these intangibles -- based on a lifetime of experience. You may be looking at home ownership with the investment logic in full gear. Both are important. But give greater weight to the story told by someone with a few more decades on the planet. She knows something you don&#x27;t.<p>And remember. You can&#x27;t make a mistake. If you buy a house and it is horrible and you sell it and you lose money? You have lived your life.

Pointing out irony or hypocrisy is important because doing so helps to weaken false arguments put forth by those in power. For example, when someone like Zuckerberg claims that privacy isn&#x27;t really important in the modern age (I may be mixing him up with one of the Google guys, the point is the same), then acts to increase his privacy, it tells people that perhaps he isn&#x27;t being entirely honest.<p>I will admit, though, that the HN crowd probably already knew these particular arguments were false, so perhaps the value of this link on this particular site is somewhat diminished.<p>> We as a society need to start learning how to deal with this, accept our place in the food chain, and obey those more fortunate.<p>This struck me as incredibly anti-market.

Are the lives of the people who work in these factories better or worse as a result of these jobs existing?<p>The answer I end up arriving at repeatedly is that it is a resounding improvement in the lives of almost everyone. RMG factories empower women to provide for themselves in a way that nothing else in the country can. There simply aren&#x27;t any other jobs for women in low-income brackets in Bangladesh and I personally know individuals who found the courage to break themselves out of abusive marriages and the ability to say no to marriages they didn&#x27;t want because of the income they have from these jobs.<p>2. Could the factories be better?<p>Yes, absolutely. Most of the owners could obviously afford to pay employees better given the incredible amounts of wealth that the factory owners have accumulated and having gone to school with some of their children, I know quite a few factory owners personally. The reason they don&#x27;t pay more comes down to simply business principles. The objective of a labor intensive business is to drive costs down the lowest possible amount legally. That is what they do.<p>3. What is the government&#x27;s role?<p>This is pretty simple. They should raise the minimum wage for factory workers, create more stringent regulation and make great effort to ensure those regulations are followed.

6538996,comment,6533102,6535419,1,0,bane,,,"Some thoughts:<p>- To an outsider, Zhuyin Fuhao (注音符號) aka Bopomofo, c 1912 seems like an obvious and easy solution to the problems of the Chinese system. Yet it wasn&#x27;t adopted during the simplification movement of the 1950s. Why is that? I think the reasons are complex and largely have to do with strong cultural biases towards logographs and a cultural comfort with education being the same as memorization, but other, more  practical reasons may have contributed. For example, the very large number of homophones in spoken Chinese -- which are partially resolved via tones and context and unambiguously resolved by referencing the appropriate written character (do you mean this character or this one when you say that?) Chinese speakers on HN will probably be familiar with this kind of conversation clarification style.<p>- Korean, which has a very large number of Chinese loan words (한자어, 漢字語), but doesn&#x27;t have tones to help resolve homophones, and Hangul (한글) doesn&#x27;t even have different written forms, ambiguity can become problematic. Koreans will also often reference the Chinese written forms to resolve this! It&#x27;s not uncommon, in formal Korean writing, to see a bit of Chinese written in parentheses next to the Hangul form to clarify the meaning. The same kind of conversation, referencing the appropriate Hanja (한자, 漢字) to sort out ambiguous homophones is also probably familiar to Korean speakers on HN.<p>- Knowledge of written Chinese is a social prestige marker in Asia, like knowledge of Latin and Ancient Greek, and later French used to be prestige makers in the West. Men, traditional holders of most of the prestige positions have cared about these kinds of markers more, and spending lots of time and money educating girls in useless (for women) prestige things like reading/writing wasn&#x27;t traditionally important. Using Chinese characters in Korea and Japan was important for social standing, and using &quot;simple&quot; non-Chinese systems might have been viewed as a shameful mark against...not too unlike Westerners, with perfectly fine native languages, writing to each other in French or Latin instead. For example, Isaac Newton, who I assume was perfectly capable of writing in English, wrote Principia in Latin.<p>- Hangul, though a 15th century invention, wasn&#x27;t widely used except as a feminine script until Korean Nationalist and Identity movements in the late 19th century, intended to help cultural resist Japanese annexation pushed Hangul into prominence. During the occupation, writing in Hangul was considered a form of protest and resistance against the attempted cultural dominance of the invaders. Only Japanese was officially allowed during most of the occupation and downtown Seoul looked like a Japanese city with all of the Hiragan and Katakana on the street signs.\n    - Old letters in Hangul are almost exclusively written between women, or between women and men who were close to one another <a href=""http://imgur.com/a/IZpqn"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imgur.com/a/IZpqn</a><p>- Hangul underwent a number of orthographic reforms, modern Hangul is a bit different the original, losing quite a few letters, some spelling formalization and a modernization movement in the 20th century establishing many rules that school children learn today. 15th century Korean written in Hangul is about as readable to a Korean today as 15th century Chaucer written in the original English is to a native English speaker.<p><i>This frere bosteth that he knoweth helle, And God it woot, that it is litel wonder; Freres and feendes been but lyte asonder.</i>",1381591028

But because Go chose &quot;defer&quot;, the compiler must insert code that dynamically keeps track of cleanups to handle the general case. This results in indirect function calls, and bookkeeping overhead, whereas RAII is purely static function calls.

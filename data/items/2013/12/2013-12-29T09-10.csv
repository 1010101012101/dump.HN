Me and a bunch of 314 St. Louis BBSers had some issues with it, and he got mad and went on our Facebook group and told us to make our own. I tried to raise money via a Kickstarter and Indiegogo, got nothing. Apparently I don&#x27;t know how to connect to people and get donations to save stuff.<p>The issues we had were that the BBS history documentary was not technical enough and focused more on people and had whitewashed the history and downplayed the negative side of BBSing. The 314 BBSers got scattered all over the world, but none of them besides a few wanted to help with a documentary.<p>I had saved MAME ROM files about a decade ago. I worked with friends who ran an arcade business and we dumped a lot of ROMs. Bought some broken systems just to take out the ROM chips and use an EEPROM reader to dump it. Donated the files to some people on the Internet who burned CD-Rs of the MAME and MESS ROMS for a small donation. I think it was 0.33 or something. Our mission was to save as many ROMs as possible for historic reasons. Then get them into the hands of collectors who wanted to play the emulators to avoid using their arcade machines that would wear out. My brother built one of the first MAME arcade machine mods in our area, but it is broken now. He bought an old Donkey Kong machine from the guys who ran the arcade company, and then modded it with PC parts and ran this thing called TinyXP that was a pirated version of XP with just the core OS files. It had DirectX and other stuff so it ran the 32 bit Windows MAME.<p>Good luck hosting that 40+Gig file, there is a web site in the UK called &#x27;Pleasuredome&#x27; and if you Google Search &#x27;Pleasuredome Torrent&#x27; Google will show it without a description. They got free no ratio torrents and I think they got a new MAME ROMset for 0.152 now and then MESS 0.152 as well as the CHDs for MAME and MESS.<p>Everyone knows MAME, but people forget MESS that does personal computer and video game console emulation.<p>I remember one friend of mine had modded a PC clone&#x27;s floppy cable to read Atari 2600 cartridges. It was the socket connector instead of the pin connector for those old 5.25&quot; 360K floppy drives, the 2600 carts if you opened them up, would fit on the socket and then you could read the ROM with a hack and dump it to a hard drive. He dumped every 2600 cart he could find for this Stella emulator.<p>People always remember those who host the files, not the people who dumped them and made the files in the first place.",1388309880

It would be hard for me to think of a worse analogy, honestly, since it fails in the most single important dimension!  There&#x27;s also something poetic since claims of &quot;witchery&quot; are a centuries-old tool used to silence women.<p>The quality and provocative nature of your analogy not withstanding, I&#x27;ll give you the benefit of the doubt.  The comment to which you&#x27;re replying is my attempt to unpack it.  What about my comment wasn&#x27;t clear for you?<p>For example, I see in your intentionally provocative analogy the same mistaken logic I described, that somehow the existence of privilege and the idea that you are privileged in certain ways is equivalent to being a witch and therefore that being privileged makes you a &quot;bad person.&quot;  I spelled out how that&#x27;s a mistake many people make when thinking about privilege and yet you seem to be making it in this very comment.<p>Anyhow, I&#x27;ll try to illustrate why privilege is not a scarlet letter but denying it can make one complicit.<p>Here&#x27;s a hilarious Louis CK skit on the subject of racial privilege: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TG4f9zR5yzY"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TG4f9zR5yzY</a><p>&quot;I&#x27;m white.

Let me be clear, by the way, I&#x27;m not saying that white people are better.  I&#x27;m saying that <i>being white</i> is <i>clearly</i> better.  Who could even argue?  If it was an option, I would re-up every year!&quot;<p>Here&#x27;s a way in which I am privileged: I can spend $1000 on a pair of glasses I really like and not have to think twice — or even once — about it.  I don&#x27;t think this makes me a bad person for doing it, let alone being able to do it.  Nevertheless, most people would not just balk at paying that much, but wouldn&#x27;t even consider the idea.  Growing up my family couldn&#x27;t really afford glasses (or doctors visits or dentist visits or....), so the situation still feels really weird to me.<p>Here&#x27;s another way: I will never have to so much as think about being stopped and frisked in NYC, unlike, say, Forest Whitaker (<a href=""http://pamshouseblend.firedoglake.com/2013/02/16/forest-whitaker-given-the-stop-and-frisk-inside-nyc-deli-in-false-theft-allegation/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pamshouseblend.firedoglake.com/2013/02/16/forest-whit...</a>).<p>Here&#x27;s yet another way: if I&#x27;m in a room with a female engineer I know talking to two other men that neither of us know, I would bet hard money virtually all of the technical questions will be directed at me.  At that moment I have a choice.  I could answer those questions and go on my way.  I could point out what&#x27;s happening, perhaps by asking, &quot;Why are you asking me all the questions?  Tara is just as capable of answering them as I am.&quot;  I could maybe take a more tactful middle-ground and say something like, &quot;I&#x27;m not sure.  You should ask Tara those questions — she&#x27;s the expert.&quot;  And so on.<p>I am not a bad person for benefitting from that privilege, but if I were to deny it I <i>would</i> be complicit in reinforcing those patterns of behavior, abuse, and oppression.<p>So, yeah, <i>totally</i> like being a witch!

Git also will forget timelines (transitive closure of a reference) you don&#x27;t care about if you tell it to.<p>So it&#x27;s important to distinguish purely persistent data structures in the sense of Okasaki et all, and append only datasets in the semantic sense. Git still qualifies as the latter even though it&#x27;s implementation uses mutability as appropriate.<p>This is a good example of where the OP&#x27;s critique is painting with too broad a brush. If we think from first principles: indexes are derived state, not primary state. The value log is the ultimate authority, the index can be regenerated at will. There is a huge design space of indexing over append only logs that remains largely unexplored.<p>I personally strongly believe databases will move emphatically in this direction because the benefits are so great.

And you need the people that will do that. Expect if you are the investor and paying them to do so...<p>To  my mind and my experience unfortunately, if you have a co-founder who is doing only business without any other contribution (e.g. money) and he has same equity of your company as you then he is ripping you off. Better go to YC and give them 5-10% and access their network if you need a what u call program manager...<p>the reason you decide to start-up, is that although you don't know everything, it means you already know or u are willing to use other skills too and/or learn the rest  (including those you are reffering to) , in order to encompass more characteristics --enough to take the risk to become a founder. Otherwise using one skill (e.g. programmer) should get you a job somewhere.<p>\nan non-YC example with female co-founder I am aware of is Emily Boyd of www.rememberthemilk.com \n",1173646534

3632,comment,3542,3542,0,0,domp,,,"Good reflective piece on Y Comb. It seems like being around people that were also highly motivated entrepreneurs really pushed you guys to work harder to create a great product.<p>I also agree with the hiring issue. Reminds me of a popular book called ""The Tipping Point"". It's all about finding the certain characteristics others might have that'll get your concept to become an epidemic.",1173643921

3630,comment,3629,3629,0,0,amichail,,,"It seems to me that if a startup requires very specialized knowledge, then one founder may be better than two or three.  An excellent example of this would be X-Plane by Laminar Research: <p>http://www.x-plane.com<p>",1173643541

I think the most frustrating part is when someone obviously doesn't understand what you're trying to do and proposes another route that is just bad. I think with any new concept people are very rarely capable of seeing another alternative outside of the way it's always been done. Any laughs I'd just shrug off as just them not understanding.\n",1173643337

But there is a better solution to the whole URL shortening issue, how about Twitter assigned a fixed length to URLs. So a url in your tweet is say 5 or 6 characters. And it always converts to "">link"" (that's 5 characters).<p>Done, the URL shortening destroying the internet problem is solved.

So if you lose 6 times (on your $50, $100, $200, $400, $800, and $1600 bets), you can't double your bet anymore.  You'll be stuck with betting $2000 at most, which means you can longer guarantee yourself a profit.<p>But now that I think about it, you could always just move to another table with a higher limit. Of course, if you're going through all this trouble to make $50, you probably don't have the bankroll to keep going.<p>Maybe another reason for tables having different limits is that the pit bosses don't trust the dealers (or security?) in the low-roller areas to handle money above a certain amount?",1250020688

It seemed like a considered decision, made from a position where they could afford to wind down the service over 6 months.<p>I think their decision to <i>not</i> shut down may be frankly irresponsible.  Their reasons for closing seemed fair: bit.ly has a monopoly on URL-shortening due to Twitter; there's really not a market for more than one or two URL-shortening services; there's no clear way to monetize URL-shortening unless you're the dominant player (and can sell stats); any sale to a third party risked turning the service into something evil that they had ethical problems with; keeping the service open would just burn money and effort better spent on other things.  All, to my mind, valid reasons for closing.<p>Deciding to reopen (or not close) because a bunch of people complained -- people who aren't going to solve any of those fundamental issues -- that seems like the questionable decision.<p>They were doing the right thing, but seemingly got talked out of it.

However, I think this misses the crux of the problem: diagnosis.<p>It's easy enough for me to call a mechanic or two to find out how much they would charge to replace my transmission, but how do I know that my car <i>actually needs</i> a new transmission? My primary fear when going to the mechanic is that they'll claim that my car's problems are much more serious than they actually are, so they can charge me for the more expensive repair.<p>They can easily get away with this, because I'm not knowledgeable enough on the subject to second guess them. Oddly enough, the situation isn't much different with doctors and dentists. Every time my dentist decides to drill into my teeth, I can't help but wonder if they just see it as an opportunity to make a large sum of money.<p>If anything, the situation is worse in the medical industry. They almost never give price quotes up front. What's up with that? And there's basically no way of knowing how much your insurance will cover. Generally I just do what the doctor/dentist says and save my pennies while I wait for a huge, seemingly arbitrary bill to arrive in the mail.

You won't be ahead by much, and the strategy won't work in the long run (i.e. you can only do it a couple of times--when you inevitably end up with 7 consecutive losses it will more than wipe out any earnings you make), but it is nevertheless a legitimate strategy to ""beat"" roulette in the short term.",1250018318

So the Fed won't need to give as much money to the banks, because people are giving it to them to pay down their debt?<p>OTOH, if people aren't spending, then unemployment goes up, which is bad.<p>Unless people aren't paying down their debts, but rather going bankrupt and the banks are writing them off.

When you graduate, you will have a corpus of code to show people, and a documented history of playing well with others. That will matter more than your GPA to any company you would actually want to work for.<p>2) Have a social life. As someone else here commented, don't be afraid of girls.

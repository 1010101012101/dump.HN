10893291,comment,10892771,10892771,0,0,dnnrly,,,"I started being on-call a few months ago. For us it works like this:<p>- 1 week in 4 Monday 00:00 to Sunday 23:59, with a fixed pay adjustment (same fixed amount added to our salary every month, not a % increment).<p>- If you get a call, you&#x27;re on the clock and get paid regular over-time rate. Theoretically this only applies if you get called and are doing something for more than 30 minutes though.<p>- I know most of the on-call managers personally so don&#x27;t mind picking up the phone for a quick opinion for free, if it&#x27;s at a reasonable time.<p>- Online within an hour once we&#x27;ve picked up the phone.<p>- Senior on-call manager gets woken up by Ops first and then will decide which parts of the system are affected. After going through known issues and work arounds will then work out which part of the system needs to be looked at and makes the call to the on-call developer that is appropriate (ie. which team).<p>- Duty is primarily to diagnose and provide knowledge to the on-call manager to make a decision so service can come back up again.<p>- Don&#x27;t do code fixes (J2EE on my team, mix of Java and C++ on others) - we have far too much to go wrong for hacking around like that, but may do config changes and some scripting. The line can get a bit blurred.<p>- In our team we should raise a ticket/Jira for every time we get a call so that it&#x27;s visible to everyone what happened and see where our pain points are.<p>- During office hours, Production issues are distributed in the team in the same way as bugs, according to domain knowledge and individual capacity.<p>- We tend not to get called out except for when we do installation in to Production. We have a fairly heavy weight process for releases - which we are working on.<p>- I am at least 4 levels of communication away from any customers, including 1st and 2nd line teams.<p>Edit: formatting",1452679121

What would be good keywords and place to\nlook for, any hints?<p>It seems to me that you can go quite far with mutable but mutually disjoint\nranges - which is more or less what slices do for vectors currently. They are\nalso safe, because you can only split them into subslices (which borrow\nownership), but not extend them (what could potentially create overlapping\nranges). Moreover as long as there is any range to given container, you can&#x27;t\nperform operations that could invalidate derived ranges (things that reallocate\nvector, etc.)<p>Range checking don&#x27;t seem that bad, because in most cases it is not about\ntrusting what a range tells you, but range trusting itself which is fine. Take\nyou example of binary search, if range would know how to split itself in the\nmiddle, it wouldn&#x27;t really have to do any bounds checking. For sorted ranges\nmaybe operation like lower_bound or upper bound would be great primitives, or\nsingle operation that encompasses both situations:<p><pre><code>  let (lower_range, equivalent_range, upper_range) = range.split(&value);\n</code></pre>\nOf course, in general as you point out, you would have to pay a price of bounds\nchecking for random access.<p>As far as I can see, this should be sufficient to implement algorithmic part.\nWhat I still find hard to do, is to modify collections based on resulting range.\nFor example, how to write equivalent to following C++ code, that first moves\nconsecutive duplicates to the end of array, and then erases them from\ncontainer:<p><pre><code>  std::vector<int> v { ... };\n  v.erase(unique(v.begin(), v.end()),\n          v.end());\n</code></pre>\nI have a few ideas, which mostly boil down to following: create a description\nof operation to be executed, but is executed only after all ranges have\nreturned their ownership over collection.

The continued references to obsolete definitions confuse things further.<p>In practice, the phrase &quot;an art&quot; is usually used in the same way as &quot;an artform&quot;, as it is not meant to be taken literally; a commentator may say &quot;there&#x27;s a real art to mastering the offside trap&quot; in football, but he does not mean that the defender should be put in a glass case in a contemporary art gallery.<p>The whole art/science classification of programming appears to me to be people defending their philosophy or encampment. If you&#x27;re working in formal methods, you&#x27;re likely to say &quot;it&#x27;s about the science&quot;, but if you&#x27;re hacking the last cycle out of a console processor in the games industry you might say &quot;wow, that was really clever, it&#x27;s really an art this isn&#x27;t it?&quot;<p>I&#x27;d say both of these views are daft. &quot;Science&quot; is usually synonymous with Physics/Chemistry/Biology, which are inescapably different from programming or Computer Science. Similarly, fine arts is not isomorphic to programming.<p>What we usually do is much more like a craft. Sure, it has elements of engineering and maths, and in CS research we borrow some of the scientific method some of the time, but you could probably say the same about any craft, e.g. making jewellery, pottery, etc.<p>All crafts can strive for both beauty and utility, and can borrow from scientific methods and engineering when appropriate, but &quot;pure&quot; science or &quot;pure&quot; art they ain&#x27;t. There&#x27;s no ground truth in craft, and there&#x27;s a strong degree of utility, which precludes it from being science or art respectively.<p>I&#x27;ve heard this discussion dozens of times. Always the mathematicians want CS to be a science, and the hackers want it to be an art or maybe engineering, but I think the argument is counter-productive. Programming is quite unique, but if you really want a relative description, it&#x27;s kinda like a craft that uses certain maths and engineering in places.<p>I think dropping &quot;science&quot; from &quot;Computer Science&quot; would help immeasurably.

Be online fixing the problem within 15 minutes of being called. Typical workload 2 hours per week. Be somewhere with a reliable internet connection, and where you can stay even if an issue takes a few hours to resolve (no mobile internet from campsites). Be sober.<p>Fixes: Because of the need for code review and second testing, emergency code releases never happen out of hours. Instead, all code deployments include a backout plan, which reverts to a known-good version of the code (not a bug-free version, there&#x27;s no such thing, but a version that hasn&#x27;t caused major problems when run for several weeks). Data in the database may need to be manually fixed.<p>If you&#x27;re patching an issue by deleting some bad data, and in your judgement deleting the data might delete evidence needed to identify the root cause of the problem, try to identify the root cause if time allows.<p>Priority: On call is only called for major problems - either their software has raised an alert saying they should be called, or there is a problem costing thousands of pounds a minute such as &quot;website down&quot;, &quot;customers cannot place orders&quot; or &quot;customers will not receive orders&quot;.<p>There isn&#x27;t a formal SLA, but as it costs thousands of pounds a minute the expectation is to fix as fast as you safely can, without mistakes that make the problem worse.<p>Escalation: To their team leader, or to some other senior software engineer on their team (our team leaders have all been senior software engineers on the team they lead)<p>APIs down: In a rather old-fashioned design move, all critical components are maintained in house.

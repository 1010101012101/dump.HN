Netflix's competitors.  If their show was wildly popular, that's something you don't want to reveal lest others try to replicate.<p>""Media consumers may like to know this information as well.""<p>I'm not convinced that media consumers change their habits based on the number of viewers in america.  Number of viewers in social circle, sure, but in all of america?<p>To put that in perspective, Fox News is watched more than MSNBC but the MSNBC viewers won't jump to Fox based on that fact.<p>Ultimately, the reason why numbers were released historically was for advertising purposes.  Shows and networks could demand more money for advertisements if they had more views, and companies like nielsen emerged to give a third-party view (akin to credit ratings agencies).  That's not relevant in the internet age, where you can precisely count how many ads are shown and where they are shown (and possibly a bit more about the people watching).",1359957564
5162700,comment,5162105,5162486,3,0,aphyr,,,"Mass distribution of learning material has been around for a few centuries and has yet to replace the process of <i>guided learning</i>. The problem is simple: while it's possible to amass facts and skills from reading and listening, it's much more difficult to produce complex works of value without feedback on the process.<p>Doing mathematics isn't just applying rules and techniques. It's about knowing how to reason, and writing a proof in a way which communicates your reasoning clearly to others. You can get started by following along with proofs from a lecture, but in order to really ingrain the techniques in your brain, you have to write proofs of things you've never encountered before. Someone has to <i>read</i> those proofs, and give feedback on where your reasoning was unclear, incomplete, or flawed. They can suggest a different notation, or a shorter path to the same solution. Good teachers will leave notes: ""this is a cool idea you've developed here, and it points towards this area of complex analysis we haven't talked about yet.""<p>In psychology it's not enough to memorize a summary text and a smattering of papers. You need to be asked questions. ""There's a critical flaw in this paper's sampling methodology. Can you find it? How would you improve it?"" ""What kind of systematic bias can we expect in these results?"" If nobody asks those questions, and helps you hone in on the answers, you'll miss out on half the text. You'll be unprepared to evaluate the quality of others research--or to design experiments of your own.<p>This process can't be automated yet. Human beings have to read and respond to your work, preferably at interactive latencies.",1359957518

5162678,comment,5162287,5162568,3,0,zecho,,,"There are quite a few ways to answer your question, so I'll do my best to address all of them that come to mind.<p>First, why does anyone need to know anything? There's a favorite passage of mine in Walden about news being gossip, and those that read it being women over their tea, which cuts to the trivial nature of most news, but Thoreau failed to recognize some things because his focus was on living his own life and not worrying about the lives of others. He had no use for the type of information he derides, but never acknowledged that others may have use for such information.<p>So, with that in mind, let's think about this from a few perspectives beyond our own myopia.<p>The audience. Audience can be broken down into various sub-groups, but I will focus on the likeliest readers of Vulture.<p>Media professionals may need to know this information because this information gives them greater insight into their own work. If Netflix produced and distributed a popular show in a novel way, I would very much like to know details like exactly how popular this show has been.<p>Media consumers may like to know this information as well. If a new show (let's call it Jumping Off A Bridge) airs and it is reported that 5 million people watched, perhaps the show is good. If 5 million people are watching Jumping Off A Bridge, perhaps I would enjoy Jumping Off A Bridge, too. Such is the world of entertainment news, which is most definitely not hard news, but clearly has an audience.<p>(Let's also not forget that audience is what advertisers want.)<p>Which gets me to why journalists would need this information. There is a particular news value called magnitude. If something affects a large portion of their audience, then the news should be reported. As Vulture is a media blog, of course their audience is likely the one or both of the subgroups I mentioned above. However, this information has little value on, say, the front page of The Minneapolis Star Tribune or even most pages of The New York Times, as the number of viewers could not possibly affect a sizable number of their readers in general. Cultural proximity matters.<p>Do journalists have a right to know this information? Sometimes, sometimes not. That's really irrelevant to journalists. The purpose of their work is to provide relevant information to their target audience, whether that is tech start ups or the 112 people of Podunk, Kansas or the citizens of the United States who expect and need a fourth estate as watchdog over its governing bodies.",1359957088

A good friend of mine, who's a 7th grade social studies teacher, shares the author's disdain for Khan's handling of history. He cited disjointed events, without any explaination of how they were connected, stating it was very ""this happened, then this happened, then later THIS happened probably because of this which happened between this and this..."" -- no coherent historical narrative, and ultimately more difficult to understand. It's easier to remember events when you understand their causes and purpose, rather than just their place on a timeline.<p>After watching Khan's Intro to CS videos, I'm inclined to trust my friend's assessment.<p>As far as Rhee is concerned: The crux of the argument is, ambition non-educators who try to ""fix"" education have a tendancy to make it worse.  Rhee and the VCs fall into the same category.

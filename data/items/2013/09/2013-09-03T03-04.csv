They&#x27;re getting industry veterans with great design talent. They&#x27;re getting a Lumia product that has the best build quality of any non-Apple smart phone. They&#x27;re acquiring proven channels to access global markets. Both Nokia and Microsoft have been floundering in the mobile space recently; neither have had any real explosive successes. Together they might make some really compelling offerings.<p>I&#x27;m not a fan of their mobile OS, but I am a huge fan of Nokia&#x27;s latest smartphones, and if Nokia design&#x27;s talent can figure out how to introduce a better UI, I&#x27;d seriously consider getting The Windows Phone as my next smartphone.",1378180612

I visited an Amish parish in central Ohio. It wasn&#x27;t just visiting the gift shop. It was a long story but we ended up sharing a meal and spending the day with them. They are great and warm people. Very good food. Women are reserved and never really talked to us much. The place was fascinating in how clean and pristine it was. Now going back to technology -- yeah they are crazy. I don&#x27;t have any other way to put it.<p>See I don&#x27;t mind artificial handicaps. Like say, ok, let&#x27;s see if I can program a web server in assembler for fun, or use an editor without syntax highlighting with the delete button disables, or spend the weekend without making any left turns.  Those can be fun learning experience or just fun things, goofing around.<p>But, structuring the a whole life around arbitrary restrictions (can use pneumatic tools but not electrical, can use a car but have to paint it black, can&#x27;t own a car but oh, you can hire a taxi, can own a tractor but has to have metal wheels, can&#x27;t use electricity for light but can use it for power tools in the shop) I see it more about abuse and control of minds than anything.<p>This is especially interesting to see if you look at other countries. Countries where there is pervasive poverty . They would love to get their hands on new tractors, electricity, cell phones, better education and I wonder what would they think about these groups of people in a developed country going out of their way to avoid all those things.",1378179846

We bring our expectations to interactions and these are <i>cultural</i> expectations.  Keep in mind I am married to someone from another culture, so while I have a lot of experience but I can&#x27;t call it scientific.<p>For example, power relationships affect communication differently among Chinese than Americans.  Americans will communicate differently when questioning a boss&#x27;s decisions and this leads to Chinese assuming their authority is challenged when this isn&#x27;t intended for example.  Similarly on the other side, Americans may miss the subtly of the communications that the Chinese expect and this can cause problems too.<p>So with this in mind, I think that the question is how well are people able to communicate effectively, and accents are, I think, at best a proxy for a lot of other thins going on.<p>If I were to make one recommendation, it is &quot;recognize that everyone is ethnocentric and if you are working with people from other cultures, expect misunderstandings, and work with them.&quot;",1378179842

Unless you&#x27;re going for a position that requires a PhD in computer science and your job will be writing algorithms and solving overly complex problems, the pen and whiteboard approach just doesn&#x27;t work in 2013.<p>Hiring a developer shouldn&#x27;t be as complicated as some companies make it out to be. Maybe for the likes of Google it has to be a lot more complex than others because they have an image and large workforce that depends on people being excellent self-managers and workers that require minimal management.<p>For smaller companies you are wasting your time and my time asking me questions that test my ability to remember things more-so than they do to search and find answers. Lets face it, most developers these days are hackers. I&#x27;ve never met a developer who knows the answer to everything, I&#x27;ve seen the best of the best using Stackoverflow to find an answer to their question.<p>The difference between a good developer and a great developer is knowing a little and for the stuff you don&#x27;t know, knowing exactly what to Google when you encounter a problem you can&#x27;t solve off of the top of your head. As Albert Einstein famously said, &quot;Never Memorize What You Can Look Up in a Book&quot;  that doesn&#x27;t mean don&#x27;t learn anything, but get the basics down and eventually you&#x27;ll know what to Google when you don&#x27;t know something.<p>The real test of any developer is if they&#x27;re a good fit for your team, have good work ethic and can get the job done. You can find the smartest developer in the world but they might not be a good fit for your team. Culture matters as does a good work environment with compatible people.<p>The best way to test a developer anywhere in the world is to give them access to a computer, an IDE and their environment of choice. Then ask them to build you something. Don&#x27;t ask them to write binary search code if they&#x27;re being interviewed for a front-end position, ask them to build something.<p>Welcome to your interview; build us a blog, build us a todo app, write a simple Wordpress plugin, write a jQuery plugin or what my current employer did: they brought me in for a trial for a couple of days (paid) and asked me to get my hands dirty on a real project they were currently working on.

Nokia&#x27;s downfall has literally been the biggest business failure in the history of the planet - see communities-dominate.blogs.com for backstory. (As I mentioned in a previous post; I&#x27;m largely summarizing things Tomi proves with hard data.)<p>My interpretation of this is that the increasingly untenable position of Stephen Elop began to incriminate the whole board, as any toppling of Elop would invite all sorts of questions as to why he wasn&#x27;t booted yonks ago. The only way that Microsoft had of avoiding another black eye for Windows was to buy Nokia to appease investors (seriously, how many black eyes can one platform get? Is it a potato?)<p>Consider: Had the headline read, &quot;Microsoft deal destroys World&#x27;s Leading Manufacturer of Mobile&quot; (which incidentally is the actual, ink-on-paper market position held by Nokia circa Elop&#x27;s hire, shows Tomi) and it could have destabilized the larger Windows ecosystem too.<p>If this claim seems histrionic, recall that the ENTIRE PC INDUSTRY is like a tenth the size of mobile. Yes, I love my PC too, but most consumers seem much happier with other devices for a wide range of use cases. Therefore, getting Windows on those devices mattered. Windows Phone mattered. Windows RT mattered. Intel is on its back leg, and ARM is about to make its final assault on the server closet, where Windows Server is melting away faster than ice on a VAX.<p>And yet I don&#x27;t think people realize exactly how vulnerable Microsoft is. The one good thing Ballmer did is notice. Way too late, though. It seems strange to me that there are others who are even less clueful than Ballmer.

You know, like in science?<p>> Sorry, but you fail at basic logic.<p>Are you now going to try to argue that scientific theories eventually become true? Are you aware of the history behind that falsehood?<p>> It is absolutely valid in science to ask, &quot;What is the consequence if this theory applied to that system.&quot;<p>Yes, and that remark has no bearing on the present topic or conversation.<p>> ... even though it means accepting things we cannot test at the moment.<p>Not in science. This is science 101, and you need to learn it. Scientific theories must be vetted by empirical evidence. If this isn&#x27;t possible, the ideas under discussion are hypotheses, not theories. Here&#x27;s why:<p>The bottom line for scientific theories is falsifiability. This is non-negotiable.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_theory"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_theory</a><p>Quote: &quot;The strength of a scientific theory is related to the diversity of phenomena it can explain, which is measured by <i>its ability to make falsifiable predictions</i> with respect to those phenomena.&quot;<p>What is a &quot;falsifiable prediction&quot;? In order for a prediction to be falsifiable, it must be open to a practical, empirical test, a comparison with reality. No test, no science.<p>Many other ideas are interesting, some of them may eventually rise to the level of science, but until they can be tested and potentially falsified, <i>they are not science</i>.<p>A tempest in a teapot? Before you decide, try keeping religious fundamentalists from teaching Creationism in public school classrooms. They want exactly what you want -- a more relaxed idea of what constitutes science.<p>> However the path that science has taken for centuries says that we should make that assumption ...<p>Science makes no assumptions, it performs experiments. If no experiments or repeatable, objective observations are possible, it&#x27;s not science, it&#x27;s philosophy.<p>Why do you think it took so long for quantum theory to be accepted? How did Einstein justify arguing against it for so many years? The answer is that, in the early days, there were too few ways to test the theory. That&#x27;s all changed, and the only reason quantum theory is a theory are the great number of empirical tests that have been made, and repeated.<p>Feel free to speculate about multiple universes and the many-worlds hypothesis, but without evidence, don&#x27;t expect to be able to bully people into accepting it as science.

I ran a dev team 8 or so years ago. Half the team was in the US and the other half in India. The half in India, while speaking English, couldn&#x27;t understand the team in the US (including myself) when we spoke.

It did.<p>This is compounded when you are a founder. A founder needs to be understood all the way around as precisely as possible.

The following are seemingly reasonable candidates:<p>- Mark Zuckerberg (never going to happen, he wouldn&#x27;t agree to it)<p>- Steve Sinofsky (that ship has sailed)<p>- Tony Bates (seems like a reasonable choice; relative outsider, smart, has a tech background)<p>- Another member of Steve&#x27;s SLT (some would be better than others.

Simplicity means being able to have a clean download and install process, prepackaged for those who might be intimidated by having to install Linux on their own. Also being able to control package versioning and selection is critical for ensuring the dashboard remains as stable as possible. Powerful because it allows for many cool utilities to be installed, configured and ready to go with minimal intervention. For example, one of the existing utilities allows the RPI to cache log writes in RAM, reducing SD card wear which is critical when using the Pi. So there are many ways to dress up a system like arkOS.

The word &quot;pidgin&quot;, though, often gets attached to a temporary patois and remains attached even after the language progresses to a creole. Sometimes a pidgin will hang around even after the conditions that created it have gone away. The South Seas English pidgin hung around as a regional <i>lingua franca</i> for a long time, partly because it was handy even when not dealing with English speakers, and partly because it was a mark of distinction among the people that the English in Australia had exploited. Eventually, though, it did creolize -- Tok Pisin came from that pidgin, but it is not a pidgin any longer.<p>Hawaaiian Creole English (the academic name for the language) is still generally referred to by its speakers as &quot;Pidgin&quot;, even though the progression from pidgin to creole was documented almost as soon as the first plantation immigrants had kids old enough to talk. (Many African creoles are similarly still called &quot;Pidgin&quot; by their speakers, even though the language is not a pidgin <i>per se</i>.) The parents of those children spoke a pidgin; the words were mostly English (with the odd word drawn from Japanese or one of the Philippine languages by concensus), but the grammar was extremely simplified and the structure (head-first, head-final, etc.) tended to reflect the speaker&#x27;s native tongue.<p>You can trade and get work done in a pidgin, but you can&#x27;t communicate with much subtlety, and the kids needed something they could <i>chat</i> in. The kids (all young children are linguistic geniuses compared to us older folk) quickly developed  grammar that was consistent and had rules. You could speak the language well, or speak it badly.<p>It&#x27;s difficult to make a grammatical error in a pidgin; errors are mostly about vocabulary. A creole, on the other hand, is a <i>real</i> language. You can get all of the words right, but still make mistakes -- mistakes of the sort that <i>the yellow big ball</i> would be in English. <i>Dey bin stay buy</i> in Hawaaiian Creole is &quot;they were buying&quot; (&quot;bin&quot; puts it into the past tense and &quot;stay&quot; makes it continuous/progressive); <i>dey stay bin buy</i> is gibberish (it would mean something like &quot;they are still finished buying&quot;).",1378178006

6318503,comment,6317646,6318307,2,0,imsky,,,"@timr:<p>> Well, first off, you&#x27;re just shifting the goalposts and redefining what it means to &quot;program&quot; to suit your needs: it&#x27;s inconvenient for your argument that there&#x27;s now software that does what programmers used to do, so you just call those things something else.<p>Definitely not. I think &quot;website automation&quot; is among the simplest kinds of software automation and historically it has not required a significant amount of programming.<p>> But it doesn&#x27;t matter, because you can&#x27;t run from the core of the argument: it isn&#x27;t limited to static HTML & CSS. Want web forms, but don&#x27;t know how to write software or use databases? There&#x27;s Wufoo, and dozens of others. Want to send email? Mailgun. Mailchimp. Want to accept payments? Paypal, Stripe. Want to show an interactive map with stuff on it? Google maps has you covered. Want to implement search on your website, but don&#x27;t know anything about search? Swiftype will do that. So will Google site search. Need a sophisticated customer analytics system. OK. That&#x27;ll be one line of javascript, please.<p>That&#x27;s a stretch. Wufoo, PayPal, Stripe, Mailgun, Google Maps, and MailChimp are not going to cover 100% of use cases, nor do they all come free. You&#x27;re also ignoring that many of these services are alternatives, not integrations (MailChimp, PayPal, Stripe, Mailgun, Google Maps), of older services (AWeber, Authorize, MapQuest) that filled the same function, and a few of them are filling a need that simply didn&#x27;t exist before prior automation tools (MailChimp for email lists, Stripe for payment processing). It&#x27;s not a zero-sum game, nor do the same players stay on top throughout time.<p>> And what&#x27;s more: it&#x27;s only a matter of time before someone rolls all of these tools together into a pointy clicky interface that eliminates the token integration work (assuming they haven&#x27;t already). There&#x27;s no part of your argument that is safe from the trends that have been driving our industry.<p>I actually mentioned that in the post: &quot;For every API that wraps around a business process, there&#x27;s an application yet to be written (and an API around that application in due time).&quot; You seem to think there&#x27;s some end point, where most software will just be done and most activity automated. I doubt that will ever be the case.<p>> True, but like I said before: almost nobody needs that. There&#x27;s always going to be the need for complex software...it&#x27;s just not clear how many people will be asking for it.<p>You seem to imply that in the future, most non-complex (i.e. average) software will just either exist or be generated on demand. That seems far-fetched - there are programs orders of magnitudes simpler than &quot;software generators&quot; that routinely need to be adjusted and tuned to produce correct output (as will all the automated APIs in the future).",1378177512

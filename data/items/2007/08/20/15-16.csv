44319,comment,44260,44313,0,0,cperciva,,,"What makes you think that whoever launched this attack against Skype (assuming that it was an attack) hasn't taken credit for it?  Denial of service extortion (historically, most often against online gambling websites) is a thriving business; but you don't need to take credit publicly to get paid.  There's also the possibility of profitting from Skype's outage without even taking credit privately, simply by using the advance knowledge that an attack will take place to make profitable trades on the stock market.",1187624113

44312,comment,44188,44188,0,0,jfoutz,,,"Climate change is one of Rupert Murdoch's pet projects. The motivation for this article is nothing more than a positive performance review for David Byers. <p>Consider the first line ""America's top scientists have admitted that the calculations ... were flawed"" It's phrased as though the scientists were activly hiding the truth, pushing some secret agenda, rather than making a mistake. Line 2, ""Climatologists ... have been forced to revise their estimations"". what? at gunpoint?<p>Science is great because of objectivity. Any random guy can point out mistakes, and ""Climatologists at Nasa's Goddard Institute of Space Science"" will listen to him. The timesonline is nowhere near objective. Beware this article as a source, Its internal bias will mess with your ability to consider the quality of evidence.",1187622931
44311,comment,43635,44138,0,0,Leon,,,"I was very much hoping for the response to be a more active user base.  At least then the community would still be some-what close to providing the wanted dialogue, as most users have been here for a few months already and there is some sort of community agreement on what constitutes a 'good' post.  With a greater influx of new users the posting quality will probably go down, if not for the time it takes to grow accustomed to the social agreements on communication on the site.  During this time, will we lose valued, long term members of the community?  What is a decent solution to the problem of online community degrade?",1187622774

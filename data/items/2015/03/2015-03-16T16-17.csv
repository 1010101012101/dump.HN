I cringe every time I see my prop tax bill while my neighbors who have been here for decades pay a fraction of taxes only because they were here first [1]. But Prop 13 props up housing prices which would drop like a rock if Prop 13 were outright abolished. So there would need to be some sort of retro tax event to help lessen the pain.<p>Additionally, I would make the distinction of this tax event for primary residence, investment property and commercial property. Maybe it should just apply for primary residence, I don&#x27;t know the right answer to this but longer term, I agree that rent control and Prop 13 need to be revisited.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.planetizen.com/node/40895"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.planetizen.com/node/40895</a>",1426525185

All surfaces upon which geometries are constructed are embedded in this space. Polygons relative to an embedded surface, such as a geodetic 2-ellipsoid, are actually represented as 3-space shapes under the hood; the 2-surface is a convenience for popular use cases but the data is not organized that way.<p>There are an unbounded number of possible shapes and surfaces in 3-space. Storing and content-addressing them is easy enough. The challenge is that to be useful you need, at a minimum, generally correct intersection algorithms for all of the representable shapes. It is an open-ended computational geometry problem and we continuously extend geometry capabilities as needed. Currently, the most complex shapes can be constructed relative to a number of well-behaved mathematical surfaces embedded in 3-space. Shapes directly constructible in 3-space are significantly more limited but I expect that to expand over time as well, particularly if there are specific requirements and use cases.<p>The underlying representation was intended to mirror the spatiotemporal organization of the physical world at a data level. We can generate projections but the data lives in 3-space.",1426525148

Work is another &quot;four letter word&quot; according to the author.<p>This is partially an artifact of history and partially conflating all kinds of &#x27;work&#x27; together. We&#x27;re living in interesting times where there&#x27;s a shift of what&#x27;s valuable from simple mechanical and repetivtive skills (industrial revolution type jobs) and knowledge workers and digitial creatives. We have a unique and amazing opportunity, where it is our collective creativity that is  what&#x27;s valuable and not merely our presence or ability to be turn a mechanical crank.<p>If you follow this advice, and engage in purely a value exchange for the 8 hours a day in something you don&#x27;t care about and have no real interest in, you&#x27;re selling 8h/d * 5d/w * 50w/y * 40y = 80k hours. That&#x27;s a hell of a lot of your life to give over for merely a paycheck, especially when <i>you don&#x27;t have to</i>. It&#x27;s that last part that makes me sad, we are in am incredibly unique industry and point in history (which may not last) where you can find a job that engages your whole self while simultaneously making a good living.<p>I recommend &quot;Drive&quot; by Daniel Pink, about how to think about human motiviation and the opportunities that we currently have to reshape work. Where things like Autonomy (being self directed, choosing your hours and what you work on), Mastery (becoming great at something), and most importantly missing from the rant in this article, Purpose are what really lead to greater happiness and overall better results.<p>&quot;Purpose&quot; was why I left a high paying job where I was respected to spend 10 years starting companies that (until very recently) meant I made radically under what I was &quot;worth&quot;. Would I trade those years? Hell no. Because even if I hadn&#x27;t had the recent success with Smarterer, I knew I was working towards a bigger and more important purpose, one that could really make a dent in the universe. Being able to do that, and still eat and satisfy all my basic needs is a pretty amazing thing, and one that&#x27;s totally missed by a rant like this.<p>When I think about passion, and look for passion in people I want to work with, I look for people who care about what we&#x27;re doing. Because I don&#x27;t want &quot;butts in seats&quot; I want people thinking creatively about how we can change the world together. That could mean a day of thinking deeply without banging out any code at all. It could be a crazy &quot;in the shower idea&quot;. It could mean long hours one night to hit some big milestone. It also means that if you&#x27;ve been pushing hard on something and you need to take days off to recenter, I trust you because you care about what we&#x27;re doing together.",1426525026

9212606,comment,9211910,9211910,0,0,kxyvr,,,"What I never understood is why OCaml allows row polymorphism in objects, but not in record types.  For example, we can write:<p><pre><code>  let bar x = x#info + 1
</code></pre>
and OCaml will give a type:<p><pre><code>  val bar : < info : int; .. > -> int = <fun>
</code></pre>
which is precisely what we want since we can now define functions on any object that has an info member.  At the same time, we can&#x27;t write<p><pre><code>  let buz x = x.info + 1
</code></pre>
because we receive the error<p><pre><code>  Error: Unbound record field info
</code></pre>
This is a big deal since the exposed members of objects must be methods in OCaml.  Certainly, we can declare values and mutable values, but these are not exposed in the objects type.  Specifically,<p><pre><code>  # class foo = object val info = 1 end;;
  class foo : object val info : int end
  # let bar = new foo;;
  val bar : foo = <obj>
  # bar#info;;
  Error: This expression has type foo
         It has no method info
</code></pre>
In order to get around this, we can change these values to methods (or add getter methods that return these values).  However, the problem with doing that is then we can&#x27;t make a new object with all of the same values, but with the specified valued changed:<p><pre><code>  # class foo = object method info = 1 end;;
  class foo : object method info : int end
  # let bar = new foo;;
  val bar : foo = <obj>
  # bar # info;;
  - : int = 1
  # let buz = bar with info = 2;;
  Error: Parse error: [str_item] or &quot;;;&quot; expected (in [top_phrase])
</code></pre>
In other words, we don&#x27;t have a good mechanism for creating a bunch of immutable objects.<p>In other words, OCaml records allow immutable records, but they lack row polymorphsim.  OCaml classes allow row polymorphism, but disallow immutable updates (immutable updates meaning create a new object with everything the same, but one element different.)<p>Does anyone know why this is the case?",1426524836

The reason it was in Nature wasn&#x27;t because the project was a lot of work; it was because it was a great idea that no one had thought of.<p>And it does seem like every new idea I think of has already been done in some form when I start searching for it.  I thought I had discovered a new kind of interaction between hydrogen and lithium the other day.  I did a search for articles between year 2000 and now -- nothing came up.

It&#x27;s very clear all these cases are, if not strictly speaking entrapment, then at least manufactured by the FBI preying on vulnerable people.<p>The real question is, why would they do this?<p>I can think of a few reasons:<p>1. Personal gain. Everybody in the FBI benefits from a successful case. The agent gets a notch on their belt. Their boss can demand more funding and more toys to capture future &quot;jihadists&quot;. The prosecutors get a win and bump up their stats. Even people loosely connected benefit, like the journalists that can cover a juicy story for a few weeks, politicians that can attach themselves, etc.. The only real losers are people that are already isolated and unable to defend themselves.<p>2. Maintaining an image of social control. If you know that the FBI is bearing down on activists and Muslims, are you going to be as willing to join an activist group, participate in an Occupy-style protest movement, or even go to a protest? You could get tear gassed, you could say something like &quot;Yeah, the banks need to go&quot; to an FBI agent who later testifies that you planned to blow up a bank, it&#x27;s a hassle, just stay home, the new season of <i>24</i> is supposed to be great anyway.<p>Personally, I think both of these are primary reasons; #1 incentivizes individuals to go through this plan, and #2 makes it more likely future plans will succeed by making the system as a whole harder to disrupt. This creates a positive feedback cycle where dissent is slowly marginalized out of existence, and all political discourse is limited to what the Republicans and Democrats delineate as &quot;moderate&quot; ground.<p>And, because the system <i>works</i>, it is basically impossible to change. Combine this with pervasive surveillance and you have permanent techno-dystopia.<p>The FBI uses plenty of software to do this.

If all TCP/NC does is send the same number of packets, but the packets are &quot;more sophisticated&quot; encodings of the original data, link utilization would be the same. So apparently, TCP/NC is more aggressive than vanilla TCP, and that&#x27;s fine, but I think it should be acknowledged (haha). When they say stuff like &quot;TCP doesn’t see the packet loss, and as a result there’s no need for the TCP senders to reduce their sending rates&quot;, it&#x27;s a bit unclear what they mean - you can just as well modify the TCP stack to ignore the packet loss and not reduce the sending rate, without network coding.<p>- Why not use TCP termination?

Vegas seems like a natural fit for marijuana legalization, as a party destination, and while I don&#x27;t have hard data on this, I do wonder if they are/fear seeing a negative impact on tourism as people seek out more &quot;green friendly&quot; destinations.<p>2) The utter lack of surprise about this. Another state legalizing/decriminalizing marijuana, ho hum, whatevs. The issue has reached the point where it feels inevitable. That&#x27;s still a bit shocking for me (in a good way).<p>I don&#x27;t mean to equate the substance of the issue, but in my mind it feels similar to the march of progress on marriage equality (AKA &quot;gay marriage&quot;). They&#x27;re both areas where I&#x27;ve long thought our society needed obvious reforms, but as the years marched by, I began to expect <i>not</i> to see any substantive changes in my life.<p>Now I sit here in my 30&#x27;s, and by the time my daughter is an adult (~15 years), she&#x27;ll live in a society where (probably/hopefully) most states have some form of marriage equality and marijuana is at least decriminalized. That is amazing to me.<p>P.S. For those who think it trivializes marriage equality to compare it to marijuana legalization, I&#x27;ll remind you that this issue isn&#x27;t about making it easier for people to get high. It&#x27;s about the millions of lives hurt by a drug arrest, over 11,0000,000 arrests for marijuana possession from 1996-2012 – and the unequal enforcement of drug laws. For example, in California, a black person is 10 times more likely to serve prison time for a marijuana arrest than a non-black offender. And across the US, black offenders are 3.7 times more likely than white offenders to be arrested for possession. Even ignoring the unequal enforcement, about 12% of prisoners are serving time due to a marijuana-related offense. So yeah, it&#x27;s kind of a big deal.",1426523203

Why charge per month at all?<p>Because almost all independently published books sells almost no copies, so there would be no revenue stream. The lack of sales is not a knock at indie publishing: there are plenty of reasons to publish a book other than making money. But it makes it difficult for services to make money off of them unless their incremental costs are negligible.<p>From an author&#x27;s perspective, the monthly charge seems problematic. Why pay someone a per-month charge for a book that you wrote last year? Much simpler and cheaper in the long run to generate an e-book using Sigil or similar, and put it up on Amazon for free.<p>I&#x27;m a lousy judge of business models but the intersection of people who would use a service called <em>git</em>-anything and people who aren&#x27;t tech savvy enough to generate their own e-books or PDFs seems very small. Sigil in particular makes e-book creation trivial.<p>Comments here suggest people are using the service and pleased with it, but it seems very expensive for a relatively small increment in convenience.",1426522867

Regulation, HIPAA is a massive pain to deal with, the rules nebulous and require significant process that is expensive and time consuming.<p>2.) Violations of HIPAA lead to fines and even lawsuits from the office of civil rights.  It used to be that Business Associates could hide behind the medical institutions to avoid this but with the Omnibus rules you&#x27;ll face massive fines that will easily bankrupt any startup.<p>3.) The entire healthcare sector is extremely risk averse, slow moving and you cannot work around them you have to work with them which means you&#x27;re going to move slowly too.<p>4.) You will HAVE to integrate with dozens of other ancient applications that medical institutions use, some of which have no documentation or publicly available source code.  I hope you like searching through hundreds of pages of outdated HL7 and X12 documentation to figure out how a specific vendor screwed up their implementation.<p>5.) Large medtech companies regularly snuff out competition through lobbying and leveraging existing relationships in the medical community. So you&#x27;ve got a killer new medical app that will change the world? Big deal, your competition has three doctors who are leaders in their field(and conveniently board members).  They will tell all of their buddies at the next American Cardiology Conference that your app is garbage.  I hope you&#x27;ve got some big names associated with your startup and you can pay them handsomely.<p>6.) The medical field is a data hell.  Some of it unstructured and non-sensical, much of it is structured but has no validation.

Why was it that way? No one knows.

Getting a gold badge in Python is not as great as starting the next Facebook but it&#x27;s definitely a clear sign that you know your stuff.<p>I think your badge is worth much more than $3, but it&#x27;s very hard to value how much money it&#x27;s worth. Think about it: how much money is worth getting a GPA 3.7 vs 3.3? How much money is worth meeting Zuckerberg and talking with him for 30 minutes?<p>Getting a gold badge in Python will not result in a rise on your salary alone. On the other hand having this badge proves that you know your stuff. It&#x27;s clear how competitive StackOverflow is. If you ever decide to move to another company it will definitely be seen as a positive sign when they look at your CV. You may get an interview thanks to the badge.<p>So, to sum up, with this badge and some luck, you can work at a better company (and this means higher salary).

After all, we’re so advanced and the progress is only accelerating, it’s probably a few years away, at most.<p>Versus MIRI [1], quoting Nick Bostrom, whose book is arguably what most recently sparked all of the current discussion of AI risk:<p>> If what readers take away from language like “impending” and “soon” is that Bostrom is unusually confident that AGI will come early, or that Bostrom is confident we’ll build a general AI this century, then they’ll be getting the situation exactly backwards.<p>> [...]<p>> > My own view is that the median numbers reported in the expert survey do not have enough probability mass on later arrival dates. A 10% probability of HLMI [human-level machine intelligence] not having been developed by 2075 or even 2100 (after conditionalizing on “human scientific activity continuing without major negative disruption”) seems too low.<p>> > Historically, AI researchers have not had a strong record of being able to predict the rate of advances in their own field or the shape that such advances would take. On the one hand, some tasks, like chess playing, turned out to be achievable by means of surprisingly simple programs; and naysayers who claimed that machines would “never” be able to do this or that have repeatedly been proven wrong. On the other hand, the more typical errors among practitioners have been to underestimate the difficulties of getting a system to perform robustly on real-world tasks, and to overestimate the advantages of their own particular pet project or technique.<p>I agree with the meat of the article, though – recent AI progress has surely been oversold by the media. It&#x27;s really frustrating to see people continually arguing against strawmen when there are some perfectly lovely arguments to grapple with instead!<p>Aside: is there some kind of law we could coin that if a rebuttal to AI risk starts off by referencing Skynet and Terminator, we can safely assume it&#x27;s not going to be worth reading?<p>[1] <a href=""https://intelligence.org/2015/01/08/brooks-searle-agi-volition-timelines/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://intelligence.org/2015/01/08/brooks-searle-agi-voliti...</a>",1426522037

These are two different problems to solve, on different timescales, both important and well worth the time and energy of smart people.",1426521860

9212213,comment,9204724,9207488,0,0,soylentcola,,,"I guess this can be the case but at least in my totally-unscientific anecdotal experience, it&#x27;s not quite there yet for everyone.  About 3-4 years ago I bought an iPad 2 for around $650 because I was going to be traveling a lot and wanted something reasonably capable to take along while not adding a lot of weight to my backpack.  Maybe 6 months later, my girlfriend wanted a lighter laptop to replace her old Dell but she didn&#x27;t have a lot to spend at the time.  I spent about $500 on a fairly low powered (i3, 4GB RAM, Intel GPU, touch screen, etc) Asus laptop because it was very light and reasonably capable and well built for such a low cost.<p>Today, that iPad has cracks in the screen from the minor bumps and scuffs it&#x27;s taken over the years.  After several iOS updates it&#x27;s become slow and tedious to use.  Wifi reception is terrible so I often have trouble using it when sitting in bed, exactly one floor above my home router. Opening more than one or two tabs in the web browser causes each one to reload when switching and overall performance is barely acceptable.<p>Contrast this with the less expensive Asus laptop.  My girlfriend still uses it as her sole personal computer and runs Office apps, connects to her work VPN for access to company resources, uses it to watch movies on Netflix, browses the web, and plays casual games.  It runs just as well as it ever did and while there are also minor scuffs on the housing, the screen has no sort of cracking and the touch input still works as it always has.<p>I think that a big part of this has been how iPads and the more &quot;appliance&quot; style tablets have gotten more capable but so have more traditional notebook and desktop computers.  Likewise, the performance you get from budget/entry class computers continues to go up even as hardware stays cheap.<p>At some point, the whole &quot;post-PC&quot; thing will happen as the traditionally &quot;non-PC&quot; devices continue to become more capable up to the point where they can do 90% of the average PC user&#x27;s tasks.  But then, aside from the inability to customize or upgrade, what makes them not PCs?",1426521760

On the one hand it can be processes for understanding oneself and modifying oneself to better survive in the environment, on the other you have the illusory &quot;qualia&quot; / subjective experience. It seems possible to me to have a self-improving process and an active process to evaluate the world state and self state without consciousness, and that this could result in something life-like. In this sense, is AI far away? It doesn&#x27;t have to be necessarily.<p>It doesn&#x27;t make sense to me personally why we need subjective experience, nor what it is in a physical sense. We can have agency and variability of choice without it, but at the same time we know how powerful it is in humans.

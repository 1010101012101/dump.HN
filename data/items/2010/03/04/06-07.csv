It really doesn't allow your brain to just think about what the software is supposed to do. The fact that no one's come out with a good source to teach this stuff is very telling--it's unteachable. You have to slog through it, and when you get it to work, you're done. You can't necessarily explain how you got there or why it works. And it doesn't lend itself to being teachable, which is a good reason all the books on iPhone programming stink.""<p>""The XCode environment is flaky and shit-filled.

1166338,comment,1165057,1165360,0,0,glenra,,,"Having written Cocoa apps in the past probably makes a huge difference. They did make the DRM work somewhat better later - I actually started <i>trying</i> to develop the instant they made the SDK available so initially I was one of a huge number of people complaining about cryptic error messages and complex instructions that didn't work at all. They later replaced it with messages that were <i>sometimes</i> helpful and instructions that <i>sometimes</i> worked.<p>I tend to have a ""knack"" for breaking software - which is why I've done QA for a lot of my career. It's clear there exist people who got the iPhone DRM to work once and it just <i>kept working</i> after that; I don't know how they managed it or what if anything I did differently. As a workaround, I eventually got in the habit of treating the iPhone SDK much the way people used to treat word processors back in the day. That is: save often and make frequent backup copies of the whole project. When your project stops working for some mysterious reason, go back to the previous version that did work. In short, I applied ""cargo cult"" programming techniques.<p>I did ultimately manage to put an app in the iPhone store but that experience soured me on further iPhone development.

More and more teenagers (ok, just one market segments, but others show similar trends) are holding out for a 'cool phone' which less and less carry Nokia logos. Ask people who work in phone shops (at least in the UK), people come in excited about LGs / Samsungs / iPhones NOT Nokias any more.",1265280994

After the ""Submit button"" click event, I fire up a jQuery ajax.get() to the auth script, and then store logged-in status as a session cookie. This seems reasonably secure except for the fact that the password gets passed plaintext via the network. Is my best option to md5() it locally via JS, before I send it over? It's for a charity website so I don't think it'll be a big target, but I don't think that excuses bad security.<p>Sorry if this is better for StackOverflow, it just seems appropriate here as I have gleaned some great coding tips via HN.",1265279600

If you can cold-email some of the reviewers with some kind redemption code for the game, and if you can sell the premise to them in a couple of lines (the good sites probably get a LOT of submissions like this, you need to grab their attention QUICK), you might be able to convince them to post a review or at least a news item.",1265279188
1100228,comment,1099821,1100027,0,0,ghshephard,,,"Throughout four years of university, I made it a habit to always visit the first class of any course I had taken the previous semester (even to the detriment of missing one of my courses) and pawning off my textbook at around 80% of List (Commons book store was around 65-70%).  about 10-15% of the time I would get stuck with a book when the course required a new revision.  I'd say about 30% of the time the new revision was just a scam to drive new revenue, 50% of the time it was minor touchups of some substance, and maybe 20% (at most) it was significant new material.<p>The reality, is that with very, very few exceptions, the textbooks that were recommended weren't that books that I wanted to hold onto for life.<p>(Exception like Radia Perlman's Interconnections, Stewart's Calculus Series, did find a permanent home with me - maybe a dozen books- but they were exceptions.  Most of the great books for life I purchased as a result of my own searches.)<p>What I would love to do, in hindsight, is go back and talk to my professors and ask, _why_ on earth had they recommended books that were basically begging to be sold off to the next party as quickly as possible?<p>In a few cases the answer was obvious (textbook written by the professor. :-) - but in most cases it was like they chose the book at random because it was basically, acceptable, if not excellent.<p>Of course, with things like khanacademy, wikipedia, and other reference materials, Textbooks are slowly starting to lose their premiere place in the world.  It will be interesting to see if that is another market place that will eventually yield to an ""information wants to be free"" meme.",1265279075
1100226,comment,1097723,1100046,0,0,chromatic,,,"> <i>There remains a gulf between a language that sounded a clarion call for simplicity and has slipped a little from its principles and a language that chose the red pill and dove down the rabbit hole basically for the sheer beautiful hell of it.</i><p>I'm don't understand what the difference between Scheme circa 1975 and R6RS has to do with Python.<p>It's awfully circular to claim that Python is beautifully Pythonic despite that it's become less Pythonic even as it's adhered to its philosophy of simplicity.  If anything, I'd think that a language that ""reads like pseudocode!"" to the uninitiated wouldn't require even casual programmers to look up syntactic elements in the documentation, the way some people talk about Python.",1265279036

1100224,comment,1099993,1100102,0,0,patio11,,,"If you were doing Japanese poetry it might be a senryuu rather than a haiku.  In English, I think a fair case can be made that the word ""haiku"" means something different than 俳句 does, and that's OK.<p>(For one thing, your notion of a syllable as an English speaker is related to the mora Japanese counts by, but they're not the same thing, even when counting for corruptions of English words.  Patrick is 2 syllables, パトリック is 5 mora.  This means every haiku you've ever heard much longer than is ""acceptable"", for a certain very proscriptivist form of ""acceptable"".)<p>This is a topic of accidental interest to me because one of my undergrad theses was on autogenerating haiku.  (If there were a Turing test for haiku, one my program wrote is better than anything I've ever written.  The next hundred were crappy.  The great thing about it as a CS problem is that haikus force the reader to do so much of the work that as long as you have a good dictionary of seasonal terms to work with mashing a few of them together may actually result in something pretty, even with a very minimal understanding of grammar.)",1265278725

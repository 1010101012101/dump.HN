9578405,comment,9576917,9577343,0,0,JoshTriplett,,,"Two notable reasons I know of.<p>First, people <i>like</i> boring in filesystems, and ext4 was seen as a natural and less risky successor to ext3, which most people ran.  And I think that&#x27;s a reasonable perception.<p>Second, ext4 went out of its way to solve some of the system-level issues that tended to cause problems, before it went into production.  For instance, the ext4 developers introduced hacks to deal with software that handles write atomicity incorrectly, making it much less likely that you&#x27;d end up with a zero-length file if you cut power or crashed at the wrong time.  XFS and JFS had similar issues that actually hit users, breaking invalid-but-widespread assumptions about filesystem semantics.  ext4 at first considered having similar semantics, but instead worked around how many programs actually wrote files, which made it safer in practice.<p>(Also, &quot;in the age of ZFS&quot;?  ZFS is by no means the dominant filesystem, or even an obvious contender for that title; it has a few popular features, but it&#x27;s hamstrung by its choice of license.)",1432148387

9578400,comment,9576864,9577655,0,0,LukaAl,,,"The observation on failure modes is correct. When you process thousands of tasks every day even problems with low probability happens.
What bugs me with the transaction approach is that you loose all the information (except probably for logs). In your example, if I signup on your service and for any reason the process fails (maybe after I received the confirmation that everything is ok) I will end up having no record stored for my account. This is problematic for post mortem diagnosis, for customer support (although its easy to ask the customer redo the signup) and so for and so on. Imagine you are handling payment with an external provider (e.g: Paypal). I could end up being billed without a trace on your system that I&#x27;ve paid. I&#x27;m not saying that my approach is correct. I&#x27;m saying that just assuming that transactions will save all your problems discount the fact that your system, to be useful, has side effects (not using the term in a strict way) on your customer and possibly on systems outside your organization. I prefer to plan for actively manage the possible failure modes and to detect and correct quickly anomaly. For this reason inconsistent data is sometime better than no data.
Another point on the database approach that I haven&#x27;t thought before: In the past we designed a system that stored and updated user timelines on MySQL. It has always been a nightmare. SQL databases are not designed with an high ratio of write operation in mind. The indexes get quickly fragmented, even deleting entries doesn&#x27;t immediately deflate the disk consumption etc. I don&#x27;t see this being a problem immediately applicable to a queue use case. But with your service growing in size there&#x27;s a risk of hitting scalability problem. Obviously you could react like we have done, use a bigger database, use better disks, create cleanup jobs. But it is bad software engineering and you are just buying more time.",1432148351

For example, in my blog post on assembly [0] one of the first points I make is that on x86-64, the stack must be aligned by 16 B when calling into libc.  (Note: the point I&#x27;m making is invalid if we&#x27;re talking assembly with no libc interop, but c&#x27;mon).  That&#x27;s actually not a hard and fast rule; it has more to do with requirements of the implementation of that function for alignment.  For instance, I can invoke memset from x86-64 assembly with a misaligned stack without segfaulting on _my_ machine, _but_ that is because my implementation of memset I&#x27;m linking against doesn&#x27;t require alignment.  That might work for me today, but let&#x27;s say the next upgrade to my libc suddenly has a new implementation of memset that requires alignment for whatever reason (I think vector register access requires stack alignment, for instance).  Suddenly, my assembly program that worked the day before (possibly for years) has now betrayed me.  And you just have to keep track of alignment in your head.  Oh, someone pushed a 64b register on the stack? Misaligned by 8B!<p>I&#x27;m not arguing the point about undefined behavior (though I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s probably known bugs with certain instructions on certain families of processors [1]).  My point is that it&#x27;s very possible for assembly to betray you, and compiler warnings from C/C++ compilers are a god send compared to the usual seg faults and bus errors experienced when writing assembly.  (honestly, I find pencil & paper very useful for debugging assembly; by sketching out the state of things and trying to reason about them, you find failed assumptions and mistakes).<p>[0] <a href=""http://nickdesaulniers.github.io/blog/2014/04/18/lets-write-some-x86-64/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nickdesaulniers.github.io/blog/2014/04/18/lets-write-...</a>

This means that code above the await and code below it doesn&#x27;t run on the same thread, and there is no way to control it, this is just asking for trouble if you have other shared state. Shared state and threading is of course always trouble but with the async Task-library you hide it away, with explicit callbacks its easier to see where the entry points of second threads are and you can enclose them in critical sections.<p>However, in javascript the idea works because javascript is single threaded so you can be sure that the await-&quot;callback&quot; is always run when nothing else is.

Of course it&#x27;s an indigenous culture... one that the mainstream cultures of the &quot;blue and red tribes&quot; finds alienating and strange. The indigenous culture of the African-American community has, among other things, created the basis of American music for over a century.<p>To argue that what culture they have is simply handed to them by the &quot;blue tribe&quot; liberals is shockingly ignorant and condescending. Seriously, man, check your privilege there!<p>Where I think you&#x27;re on to something interesting is the idea of racial flight. Before the 1960s, blacks simply were not allowed to live in white neighborhoods, no matter how wealthy or successful or talented they were. Black neighborhoods were much more economically integrated, with more role models for kids (although a look into the history of redlining is valuable, something else you touched on. The theft of wealth accumulation via property values and rent is far greater than the petty crimes of burglary and mugging that justify the police state. Look into it, there&#x27;s been great writing on the subject).<p>Anyway... come the 1970s, it became socially viable for more successful black professionals and entrepreneurs to move to nicer, safer, more valuable white neighborhoods, and they did so. The more they left, the worse the ghettos got, which drove even more away. This went hand in hand with the rise of the lucrative paramilitary police state, and a massive per-capita increase in black prisoners. So it&#x27;s much, much more difficult for ambitious and talented young black kids to improve their lot in life today than it used to be - ironic, considering how much better life is for the black middle class.<p>There are other problems as well. A friend of mine, a successful upper middle class black professional (doctor), has devoted himself to teaching financial literacy to black teenagers. Lack of basic financial literacy is endemic among the poor, and contributes to the ongoing poverty. It&#x27;s also endemic among black entrepreneurs. He is also working on a side business as a financial advisor and investment counselor for wealthy black individuals. They often invest very poorly, because they distrust the white-dominated financial industry - and for good reason, given the century-long tradition of outright theft and victimization. By putting a black face on sound investing, he can help them grow their wealth more effectively. So think about the impact that deliberate bad financial advice has had economically on the black community.<p>Your formulation of blue tribe welfare-for-votes versus red tribe police state is entertaining to read, but it is simplistic to the point of being seriously wrong.

You cannot trust software more than you trust your compiler or your interpreter or in general, your processor.<p>Since big commercial OS providers are KNOWN to be collaborating with the NSA to but backdoors and spy on you in the first place, you cannot have any trust there anyways.  Why worry about random binary software on the web, when your base OS is already compromized?<p>Otherwise, you may choose to use hardware that you trust, preferably, that you have built yourself.  Alternatively, you may build a computer using triplicate parts from different sources (eg. put an Intel, an Elbrus-4C and a Godsoon, and compare bus traffic. As soon as a difference is detected, raise an exception and abort the process), similarly, put three different network controllers, made in three different countries, and compare output packets.  As soon as there&#x27;s a difference, drop the packets and signal the process. etc.<p>Once you&#x27;ve got a trustable hardware base, you can build a trustable software layer, using only sources and bootstrapping binaries by hand (with people you trust, preferably yourself), and as indicated in Countering Trusting Trust through Diverse Double-Compiling, <a href=""http://www.acsa-admin.org/2005/abstracts/47.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.acsa-admin.org/2005/abstracts/47.html</a> 
you may implement also at the software level, a similar kind of redundancy that allows you to increase the trust you may have in your bootstrapping chain.<p>But there is no way out, you have to start from the sources, read them and consider only source code when exchanging software.<p>Notice that debian is a binary distribution.  Gentoo is a source distribution.  Gentoo is more trustworthy (but you need to be careful how you bootstrap its installation, which is not easy).<p>This is why licenses such as the AGPL, and also works to make software higher level and shorter (understandable and therefore trustable by end users) such as Alan Kay&#x27;s, are important.",1432145052

What makes you think that your browser is any more trustworthy?<p>And of course, none of this matters when you&#x27;re running this software on a closed-source operating system - one which you, therefore, have virtually-zero ability to independently audit.  So even if your programs are perfectly trustworthy, the underlying operating system has free reign to compromise them without you being able to detect it or do anything about it.<p>Probably the most surefire way of being actually secure is to drive to Calgary and pay Theo de Raadt to burn you an OpenBSD CD-ROM right before your eyes, then install it on your computer (and even <i>this</i> is fraught with danger; who&#x27;s to say that Theo isn&#x27;t going to backdoor your installation?).  Virtually every other method of installing anything is insecure, whether you download the thing or have the thing mailed to you or what have you (the sole exception being to download the source code, manually audit it yourself, and manually hand-compile it to machine code - can&#x27;t trust that compiler to not be compromised, after all).  And on that note, you therefore still can&#x27;t trust Theo&#x27;s custom-made OpenBSD CD-ROM, since he very well might have compiled it with a compromised compiler, so now you have to take the OpenBSD source code and hand-compile <i>that</i> to machine code before you can do anything else.",1432144914

For example, to pick one high-profile signing key that would doubtless have been interesting to Nation-State Adversaries and would have been susceptible to such an attack: <a href=""http://pgp.mit.edu:11371/pks/lookup?op=vindex&search=0xE3BA73CAF0D6B1E0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pgp.mit.edu:11371/pks/lookup?op=vindex&search=0xE3BA7...</a>  ˙ ͜ʟ˙<p>The common safe configuration for modern OpenPGP (and upstream GnuPG&#x27;s current default, I believe) is to use RSA signing keys and RSA encryption subkeys, each of <i>at least</i> 2048 bits - really I&#x27;d recommend 3072 or 4096 bits, as use of PGP is not as performance-sensitive as TLS and there is no forward secrecy, so I wouldn&#x27;t really recommend going much below a ≈128-bit workfactor (equivalent to ≈3072 bit RSA or ≈256-bit elliptic-curve).<p>Edward Snowden trusted RSA-4096 signing and encryption keys with his life, and that obviously worked out fine for him at the time.",1432144854
9577997,comment,9575098,9575098,0,0,bgamari,,,"Most (essentially all) personal electronic devices charge with a fixed supply voltage (often 5 volts) and will draw up to some current. The product of current and voltage is power. Since we have fixed voltage, the power rating of an adapter is really telling you how much current it is capable of sourcing. For instance, in the case of a 12 Watt 5V adapter, the supply is capable of providing up to 2.4 Amperes of current. That is to say, the supply only guarantees it can keep its output at 5V if the device draws less than 2.4A of current. If the device draws more the voltage may sag which may cause the charge process to terminate.<p>What this means for your question is this: all other things being equal, the power rating of the adapter makes no difference to the charging process. So long as the device does not draw more current than the adapter is capable of supplying the charge process will proceed at the same rate.",1432144846

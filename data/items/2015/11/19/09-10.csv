As such, they have every right to expect subscribers not to bulk download and further every right to ban specific subscribers (i.e. university libraries) if they violate those ToS. Nothing new, nothing exciting.<p>If you want to be able to freely access and bulk download the papers published by your peers, maybe you should make sure that those peers publish in journals that allow such downloads. Maybe you yourself should also only publish in journals that allow these downloads. Possibly, you could even run your own preprint server where everyone can submit their texts and which then can be made available in bulk to interested parties.<p>Breaking contracts you (or a person acting on your behalf) agreed to doesn’t help at all in the long run – boycotting those who only offer contracts you don’t like until they either change or go away is a much more viable, ethically acceptable and generally more enjoyable alternative.<p>And hey, if your method to detect fraud is successful, market pressure alone might be enough: after all, who wants to submit to a shady journal which doesn’t have its articles automatically checked for large-scale fraud regularly?

Problem was the tiny tracking boat that was following the submersible on the surface to receive the data (via an accoustic link..) would not hold everyone who was going to be in attendance, so they needed a way to stream the data from the tracking boat to a US navy ship to display it on some Sun workstation there.<p>For some reason they&#x27;d decided the best option was GSM data. 9600bps should be fine - the mapping data feed was about 2400bps. Problem of course was both of these ships would be out in a fjord, far from any cells, and in motion.<p>So I ended up writing a little proxy that they&#x27;d connect to and feed data that&#x27;d do automatic redialling and then layered a variant of the zmodem protocol on top of that to handle re-sending of data, and tuned it for specifics of the app to minimize delays in catching up to the live feed.<p>I&#x27;d used zmodem a lot in my BBS days before, but that was the last time.",1447926272

I&#x27;ve been able to go from opening up a PCB editor to having a tested, functional board in under an hour, at least for simple breakouts.<p>The othermill is pretty flawed for PCB work, however. The spindle just isn&#x27;t fast enough, cross layer alignment is inadequate, it doesn&#x27;t have dust control for dealing with FR4 dust, etc. For good PCB routing, some sort of computer vision system for adjusting cut depths and picking up fiducials is also amazingly handy. That being said, we&#x27;re really impressed with our othermill and do a lot of mechanical work on it - complex aluminum parts, engineering plastics, etc.<p>Cheap soldering for one-offs is pretty much solved at this point - laser cut a stencil on a decent laser cutter (which everyone should have, anyways), stencil paste, and reflow in a cheap Chinese oven with open source aftermarket firmware. You won&#x27;t be able to do big BGAs or tiny (0201) passives, but who cares? If you have soldermask capabilities, either some photoresist method or laser cut kapton, soldering tricky components becomes much easier.<p>None of the additive (ink-based) systems have any hope of producing really useful boards - the electrical and thermal conductivity of real copper is pretty hard to beat, and doing anything controlled-impedance is pretty much out of the picture. With subtractive systems, you can just switch to 8+ oz copper or exotic substrates without changing the process materially...<p>Vias are tricky. LPKF makes two systems, one with conductive epoxy and the other with electrochemical copper, neither of which are quite satisfactory. Via rivets (or manually soldering wire) work for small boards, but are super tedious and not great for controlled impedance applications, either.<p>Being able to do decent multilayer boards is contingent on good vias, but in theory, the only other thing you need is a hot press for stacking things up?<p>Once you get into building complex multilayer boards, the time investment is just silly, even with perfectly calibrated processes, and you should just order from a board house and wait...<p>(1) I.e. boards better than DIY etching + manual soldering.<p>(2) Well, they&#x27;re not actually mine, per se...",1447924427

That&#x27;s what got Apple where they are today as well.  Pre-Rhapsody, MacOS was largely a joke in the developer community, but that changed drastically when they ditched the archaic MacOS for the Nextstep derived OSX.  When that happened, suddenly there was a reasonable alternative to Windows or the various Unices out there.  It seems entirely natural that, like the shift that pushed people towards Apple, we would see similar shifts in other OS&#x27;s that would entice people to think more broadly than seeing Apple as the dominant desirable dev platform.

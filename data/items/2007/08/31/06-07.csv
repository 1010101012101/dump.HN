You can try again and again... I could be wrong, but I don't think this is the case for Europe or countries like Japan; it's much harder to try something entrepreneurial more than once if you failed the 1st time...<p>Case in point, I think it took Sam Walton over ten tries before he got it right with Walmart. (Hell look at Edison too)<p>(I think as Americans we're just crazier than the Europeans.)",1188543426

Like others have mentioned, cropping and resizing are trivial; however, to do anything even slightly sophisticated I'd suggest looking into flash.<p>Flash 8's image API -- specifically the BitmapData class -- can provide some low-level access to an image buffer (however the image must be round-tripped from localhost to the server if you want to edit local images).<p>Alternatively, IE provides some proprietary image filters which can be used to process images (but obviously not in a cross-browser way).",1188543392

Usually when I get a downmod it's on a statement that's at least somewhat controversial, and I don't understand why this one would be.  I can't figure out why anyone except possibly juwo would want to downmod it, and I know it wasn't him because you can't downmod replies to your own posts.",1188542876

They implemented quite a few of these points too, by the way. You can say whatever you want about Nazi&#x27;s but they are by far the most successful leftist party in history, and quite a few &quot;left-wing&quot; rights today were first implemented by Nazi Germany. Big example : pensions. Scholarships (of the for-the-needy kind, not for-the-really-smart kind). There&#x27;s many examples.<p>That said, it is beyond obvious that they are not comparable to today&#x27;s left wing.<p>As hard as it is to understand today, the left-wing was very much anti-immigrant in the 1930&#x27;s. But it&#x27;s just one of many historical facts that have changed. What I still find hard to believe, is that it&#x27;s the democrats were the pro-slavery anti-black side of the aisle.<p>Some choice cuts :<p>(the first parts are anti-versailles, and some anti-immigration)<p><pre><code>  7.

The first duty of every citizen must be to work mentally or physically. No individual shall do any work that offends against the interest of the community to the benefit of all.\n\n  11. That all unearned income, and all income that does not arise from work, be abolished.\n\n  12. Since every war imposes on the people fearful sacrifices in blood and treasure, all personal profit arising from the war must be regarded as treason to the people. We therefore demand the total confiscation of all war profits.\n\n  13. We demand the nationalization of all trusts.\n\n  14. We demand profit-sharing in large industries.\n\n  15.

I really don&#x27;t think  Imageshack.us, Tinypic, or Photobucket are fair comparisons.<p>Back in the day, imageshack & photobucket were all we had to upload photos into albums because Facebook hadn&#x27;t taken off and MySpace didn&#x27;t know what it was doing. After Facebook, the disconnect of User <-> Photos was gone. It was clear, these are <i>my</i> photos and look I&#x27;m even tagged in them. Imageshack and Photobucket seem to have pivoted to try to stay competitive. Tinypic is hardly worth mentioning because its quality is poor. Imgur&#x27;s isn&#x27;t.<p>So where do you go if you really just like popular photos? Imgur. The fact that they have a community that dislikes Reddit should be indicative of the success of their additions. Would you rather they stagnate and forever provide free image hosting? Who&#x27;s going to pick up the bill after awhile? They <i>need</i> to do this.. and I think they&#x27;re being pretty smart about it.<p>As a normal internet user, your points don&#x27;t really stand out to me as a reason why I should start to become weary of imgur. If they piss enough people off, they&#x27;ll get burned and another image hosting site will rise up to replace it (because seriously, it&#x27;s not that hard of a technical problem).<p>Finally, as a personal note, I don&#x27;t really appreciate commentary that doesn&#x27;t at least try outline the pros of what they&#x27;re doing.

All Darwin&#x27;s original theory requires is that traits vary, are passed down to offspring, and affect the reproductive success of those children.<p>Darwin published &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot; before the scientific community had recognized that such things as &quot;genes&quot; really existed. So on the face of it, it&#x27;s absurd to propose that the idea that genes (as in, specific sequences of DNA base pairs at specific locations on specific chromosomes) are not the entirety of the mechanism by which organisms acquire their traits challenges the mechanism by which those traits are filtered.<p>Not to mention that there&#x27;s never been any question that environmental input affects gene expression. All this paper is basically saying is that the health and lifestyle of the parents is an environmental factor in embryo development. If you smoke crack while pregnant, that does cause predictable affects on gene expression in the child. This paper may extend that to smoking crack before you get pregnant, which, unsurprisingly, likely also affects the child.<p>The idea that this effect is anything like Lemarckianism or that the existence of epigenetic effects refutes Darwin so greatly misunderstands both Lemarck and Darwin that I don&#x27;t know where to begin.

The third mobile OS is a distant competitor to the main two. Two cell phone companies make almost all the profits in that industry.

They have to convince themselves that giant corporations can only win through non-market means. But the fact is that the market almost always favors scale. Apple and Samsung win not through suing &quot;upstarts&quot; for patent infringement, but through the kind of vertical integration only possible with scale. If you can spend $2 billion on a factory to make sapphire glass screens at a price point the &quot;upstarts&quot; can&#x27;t match, then you win, through purely market means. If you&#x27;re Verizon and can spend billions to have LTE coverage everywhere in the country, that&#x27;s what leads you to dominance over the upstarts, not the regulatory regime.<p>Go back to before the modern regulatory state.

8189667,comment,8188374,8188374,6,0,ryanmarsh,,,"We homeschool our children and for a year we tried unschooling. My wife&#x27;s cousins were all unschooled. There is definitely merit to the approach, although done right (unschooling) it can be much harder for the parent than it looks. Done wrong it can set your children up for a fantastic career barely making ends meet. So at it&#x27;s worse it&#x27;s no worse than compulsory public education. We&#x27;re much bigger fans of alt-schooling (or home schooling as it were).<p>We&#x27;ve settled on a curriculum of the classics and are part of a home schooling group organized around said curriculum. The kids meet weekly and one of the parents facilitates each year, each &quot;grade&quot; level. Even though there is a &quot;tutor&quot; (facilitator) it requires significant parental involvement.<p>The most unsettling aspect to alt-schooling in general are the ridiculous things that people say to you. It&#x27;s not that people are stupid, it&#x27;s that there is so much they know that just isn&#x27;t so. It is utterly fruitless to debate the benefits of alt-schooling with people who have not been outside the box. You cannot know how rich, valuable, and academically positive alt-schooling is on average. So you ask questions like, &quot;what about socialization&quot; as if it&#x27;s a good thing to be in an asylum run by the inmates, or &quot;what about college&quot; as if Harvard doesn&#x27;t want someone who studied latin from age 7. I digress.<p>To be fair I feel the need to share my background. I&#x27;m a high-school dropout. I subsequently aced the GED, along with the others who took the test with me. I did high school at a &quot;blue ribbon&quot; public school. Everything before that was at a small church-supported private school. We were by no means wealthy, and tuition was as cheap as it could have possibly been. Still my parents both had to work so that we could go. In the private school we did Algebra in the sixth grade, I read at a post-high school reading level in the third grade. It was intellectually stimulating and a wonderful nurturing environment. When I got to public school I found a prison for the mind. The teachers, while seemingly more educated seemed either not to care or to be overwhelmed with things other than teaching. The latter must have been as soul crushing for them as corporate work. It was soul crushing for me to be there. At first I began to advance ahead of my peers. I started taking advanced classes and realized that they were just more of the same mediocrity. At 16 I got a job programming and at 17 I dropped out. The rest, as they say, is history. I now manage a team of over a hundred programmers. I have a passionate hatred of the public education <i>system</i>. I didn&#x27;t wind up digging ditches and I believe that it is 100% because of my early education experience in that humble little school that was not unlike a homeschool club.<p>I&#x27;m not debating the merits of your public education experience. I&#x27;m not saying you wasted your time or didn&#x27;t come out ok. I&#x27;m not saying you aren&#x27;t a good person or your teachers weren&#x27;t either. I&#x27;m saying it can be better and it&#x27;s amazing how little effort it can require. Life will not fall apart if you don&#x27;t take AP Math and join the Key Club.<p>We&#x27;ve all been told the same lie, work hard in school so you can get good grades so you can go to a good college so you can get a good job so you can work hard so you can become CEO. Alt-schooling can instead prepare one well for the world where &quot;humans need not apply&quot;.",1408291872

Unfortunately, because someone could always get cold feet, a lot of these chains had been carried out simultaneously, which naturally limits the size of such a chain.<p>So the cherry on top is a &quot;non-directed&quot; starter kidney.  With this initial gift of altruism there&#x27;s a little more leeway to arrange the matches and it&#x27;s a disappointment but not a showstopper when someone finally stops the chain.<p>Anyways, it&#x27;s always nice to think about the stopgaps between now and the sci-fi organ-growing future.",1408291782

8189660,comment,8183220,8183220,1,0,ryanpardieck,,,"There was a famous writer once who said that one of his greatest assets was his extreme forgetfulness. Appropriately, I am blanking on his name at the moment, but I&#x27;ll pop back in here if I recall it. It was a long time ago.<p>However, his point was something like focusing on rote memorization of detail makes for trite, superficial, and boring fiction-writing, and that you&#x27;re better off experiencing something as intensely as possible and then forgetting it almost immediately. The idea being that your brain will recall the crucial bits more relevantly and more vividly once they have been yanked back from the fog of utter forgetfulness. I&#x27;m not sure how closely related this is to the ideas presented in the article, but for me personally, it became significantly easier to write fiction with a real sense of &quot;immediacy&quot; once embracing this principle.<p>However, fiction can require a strange sort of learning: it can involve sensory knowledge of scattered quotidian detail. Back when I wrote a lot, things like the discrete texture and smell of different wooden tables were very interesting to me. Or exactly how it feels to be in a room lit by a single large fluorescent light vs other kinds of light. I&#x27;m not sure that kind of learning transfers to any other domain, really. But forgetfulness was very useful for it, at any rate. I&#x27;m done now.",1408291714

I&#x27;m not sure what the Orphan Drug Act specifically says though.<p>Actually if the market is potentially quite large, big pharmas should already be researching it. The problematic ones are those that are in-between orphan drug and market-quite-large drug. The society probably needs less of these drugs (there should be alternatives at the other ends), but if it&#x27;s still needed, maybe expanding the scope of the Orphan Drug Act can be a good solution.",1408291689

The subjects don&#x27;t matter. The oldest likes philosophy and science. My 12 year old enjoys video production and 3d animation. My 9 year old really loves comic books and cooking. My 7 year old loves crafts and writing adventure stories.<p>We unschooled when I was making $10/h.<p>They all have big groups of friends, with an incredible level of diversity. They spend a lot of time with them, and enjoy unstructured, uninterrupted play.<p>Beyond that, they all love organized sports, field trips, traveling when we want.<p>The older children always have the option of going to school, and choose not to.<p>With regards to learning to read. Our oldest was reading at 4, one read at 9, and the other two around 5/6. It doesn&#x27;t matter.<p>Your fear and ignorance is understandable. It&#x27;s &quot;radical&quot;, and certainly not for everybody. The suggestion of &quot;child abuse&quot; is silly, and totally unfounded. I&#x27;ve <i>actually</i> met many of these &quot;clowns&quot;, and can attest from experience that you&#x27;re not only wrong, but out of line.<p>Experiencing life with our children is wonderful.",1408291606

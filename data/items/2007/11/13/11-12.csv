I am based in Leeds (<a href=""http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?hl=en&q=leeds&oe=UTF-8&um=1&ie=UTF-8&sa=N&tab=wl"" rel=""nofollow"">http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?hl=en&q=leeds&oe=UTF-8...</a>) and my current concern is about finding talent in the north. Everything I have read so far - including most of the stuff on YC News - suggests that I will have to go down south to London or Cambridge, or up-sticks and move to 'the valley'. However, recent networking events have introduced me to local talent and so things are looking more optimistic. ",1194955074

If you have no other accomplishments, grades will be the default accomplishment that you will be judged against for comparison.  So really, you are in complete control of whether or not grades will matter.  Of course this means applying yourself.<p>Likewise, your future degree has an expiration date.  I would estimate about a year from walking. Your degree will start to smell if you have no accomplishments to back it up.  Each year past graduation, the education section of your resume should be bumped farther down the page.  Eventually, it should become a matter of whether or not you have room to include your education at all.  Your  education should become a trivia fact.  A small talk subject before discussing what you have done.<p>PS:  I am of the opinion that anyone completing a four-year degree with a 4.0 grade point average did not get their money's worth out of college.",1194954226

79161,comment,79112,79159,0,0,rms,,,"That's true. I used allofmp3 for my music before Oink came around. $1-2 was perfectly reasonable to pay for an album in my preferred non-DRM format. However, in the post Oink era, it is much easier and more convienient to not pay for music. I don't think the RIAA will ever come up with a solution more convenient than Oink and its successors.",1194953244

79158,comment,79066,79127,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Agreed.  Authorize.net is problematic.  Not really because of Authorize.net, but because you have to tie it to merchant services--and every one I've used with Authorize.net has been uniformly awful.  Everything is targeted to businesses with card reading equipment, rather than online processing--all of the folks at the merchant services companies are baffled by questions about online stuff (and Authorize.net refer you to the merchant services people for a wide array of queries).  It's just a poorly matched set of tools.<p>API support for Authorize.net is excellent, though...that's the only reason I use it.  Some weekend I'm going to convert to Google Checkout or something else.",1194952264

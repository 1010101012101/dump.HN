Are these Pascal-style strings, or is that a call to a method that walks the string (O(n))?

If she was on Spotify, I&#x27;d give her a whirl - but since she&#x27;s not, just not sufficiently bothered.<p>2. I think she (or her handlers - whoever makes the decision) make a valid point - artists should be able to pick whether they appear on the Spotify free version.<p>3. Lastly - all the talk about &#x27;artist pay per play&#x27; is misdirected, as far as Spotify is concerned.<p>The only metric that matters is what % of revenue they pay out to the rights-holders. The number now is 70% - ie they keep 30% of total revenue for themselves and give 70% to the label (who is then free to pay the artist as per their agreement).<p>We can discuss whether 70% is a fair number (I personally have no idea). But talking about anything else is missing the point - since it ends up being a discussion about split between the label/artist/producers/etc - which Spotify has nothing to do with.",1415757078

Buybacks are a way to return cash to shareholders, just like dividends, with different tax implications.<p>In your example the company has used the share buyback to return 50$ to shareholders. If it wanted to do it evenly it could even do a stock split first turning every 50$ share into two 25$ shares and then buy back one share from each person. That would be functionally equivalent to doing a 25$ dividend per original share but have different tax implications (capital gains are cheaper than income taxes in most places).",1415757007

In fact one of the threads that led to IP being peeled off from the then monolithic TCP was done on my blackboard at SDC in 1974.  The reason we did that was to insert a security/encryption protocol over the packet layer - if it sounds like DNSSEC it should.  But in 1974.  But it was on a project done for &quot;the government&quot; so it never saw the public light of day.</i><p>And:<p><i>We made a huge mistake back in the 1970s when we failed to require a mandatory packet security layer between IP and the protocols over it.  (We knew even then that we needed it - and had existence proofs of running code - but the gov&#x27;t wouldn&#x27;t let those who knew out into the wild to evangelize the concept.

I agree that it&#x27;s fair to regulate such a monopoly with &#x27;net neutrality&#x27; rules.<p>But what about situations where there are multiple providers of the &#x27;last mile&#x27; connection and effective competition between them?  Should net neutrality rules apply in those cases?",1415754417

The most straightforward factor is that men and women are actually different.  Many studies have shown that innate gender preferences manifest in infancy.  I knew I was different from most girls when I was very young.  The vast majority of other women I&#x27;ve met at work and at conferences have been similar.  We were into &quot;boy stuff&quot;.  That&#x27;s perfectly fine.  But it doesn&#x27;t mean the girls who are not into &quot;boy stuff&quot; are broken and need to be fixed.",1415754355

The trees don&#x27;t even have to &quot;consent&quot; to this â€” it seems that it&#x27;s more likely that a fungus is acting as a sort of benevolent parasite than that very different trees have established some kind of cross-platform messaging system that uses a third, very different type of organism as a mediator.

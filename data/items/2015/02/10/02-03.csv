They pick the number from the most absurd form of math, which sets the bar high. If they had asked for $15m, the might have gotten only 6% of <i>that</i>, so they start as high as they can, assuming a reduced valuation, because they know the patent is flimsy at best.<p>The problem is that they got anything at all, which lends validity to absurdly obvious patents with decades of prior art.",1423537168

Many cybercriminals do the same kind of scraping and share these aggregated lists privately, but they&#x27;re always going to be missing things, so there&#x27;s no question they&#x27;re all going to be pulling in your list, too. And odds are there&#x27;s going to be at least one dump that a lot of them missed which yours has.<p>I do understand there is <i>some</i> research benefit here, but even in the best possible scenario I don&#x27;t think the value from the research outweighs the costs.",1423536726

Are there more people with unique usernames or people with unique passwords?<p>In some countries it is customary to annotate usernames with the user&#x27;s year of birth. Filtering on such usernames could give insight about the correlation between age and password quality, or identify which passwords are more or less popular given the user age. You could try to check correctness of the filter using the fact that some of those people may have used their birthdate (including the year) as a password.<p>If a seemingly rare password in the dataset only occurs for two distinct user names, then maybe those two user names actually correspond to the same user. Do such usernames have a low edit distance? Could you use this to learn general rules to determine, given two usernames, whether they seem to correspond to the same person?<p>I just gave those off the top of my head, and I&#x27;m not at all working in this field, but I&#x27;d have no trouble imagining interesting applications for this data that would not have been possible with the passwords alone.",1423534320

The thing that will really make it take off is going to be something that we haven&#x27;t thought of or currently thing is impossible.<p>The biggest issue that still needs to be overcome is the security. Sure, you can get it to be as secure as anything else today using traditional (D)TLS and certs, but some of these devices are have a (shelf) life of over 10 years. What happens to all the devices on the shelf (or just not turned on) if your CA was diginotar? Either you keep your now insecure cert so that devices can still connect to download the new cert or you just remove it and force everyone to do a firmware update manually. Do you really expect your grandma to update the firmware on their smoke detector? If you just leave it, how long do you support it?<p>All that assumes that you&#x27;re okay with the wide variety of privacy issues that come with having all this data streamed from your house (or business or whatever) up into someone else&#x27;s servers. I think another thing that is going to be important is a &quot;local iot&quot;, none of your data is able to leave a small box inside your house except for small bits of things that actually need to, like notifications or alert states. But, again, how do you solve the security in this, especially if you want compatibility between different manufactures?",1423534102

Although I was able to struggle through the work, I didn&#x27;t really recognize its power, and thought the whole thing a bit pointless. Blame either my young brain or mathematics education.<p>A couple years later when I started to take programming more seriously and was exposed to recursion, I did recognize the power there pretty quickly and made a point of getting good at thinking that way. But, I didn&#x27;t see the link then, between mathematical induction and recursive functions. A few years after <i>that</i>, when I was exposed to mathematical induction again, it seemed like such an obvious and powerful tool, and I was amazed that I didn&#x27;t recognize it for what it was on the first go around.<p>There is a saying:<p><i>when programming recursively, think inductively</i><p>...but the inverse is also true:<p><i>when reasoning inductively, think recursively</i><p>If you, or a student of yours, or your kid, or whatever, are having trouble with either concept, I would encourage you to study the other one. You probably can&#x27;t truly understand one without groking the other anyway, and insights gained from the study of one will apply pretty much directly to the other.<p>This was an enjoyable read.

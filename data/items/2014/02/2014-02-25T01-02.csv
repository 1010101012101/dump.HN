Stand up on mass, digitally and in person, for what you believe in - don&#x27;t shy from people sneering or judging that you are distrustful of the existing structures of powers. \n2. Exclude the people who support this type of spookery, from investment bankers, to hawking politicians, from polite company. Whether you meet them at a party, or a plane, shun and shame them.\n3. Crank up the noise. Write, make, do what you can to get more stuff out there. \n4. Don&#x27;t be singular. Be the complexity. \n5. Never believe again. Demand evidence, oversight, & review processes.

To this point, BTC has survived (even thrived) without much use as a payment currency (relatively speaking). It&#x27;s been more about trading.<p>So, to the extent that a MtGox failure is survivable for BTC, it&#x27;s because there are now other exchanges with significant market share to support liquidity and trading activity until its use for payments takes hold (if ever).",1393293427

7294689,comment,7293741,7294387,27,0,jjoonathan,,,"It would be slightly easier than coding Mathematica from scratch (you have better computers and an example to follow) but much harder to fund, since you would be re-treading old ground and wouldn&#x27;t be able to competitive for a long time. The types of problems simplified by Mathematica don&#x27;t include coding Mathematica. To be sure, it pioneered a few nifty techniques that you would want to take advantage of, especially regarding symbolic manipulation, but you wouldn&#x27;t be able to implement them faster if you used Mathematica (vs just drawing inspiration from it).<p>Mathematica&#x27;s huge selling points (to me) are that it&#x27;s a fantastic CAS <i>and</i> it shatters the barriers between analytic and numeric tools. Many engineering and statistical codes involve 2/3 math and 1/3 computer science (or the other way around). Mathematica is in a completely different league for those problems because it handles the 2/3 about 50x better than your typical programming language and it handles the interface between the 2/3 and the 1/3 about 100x better than your typical programming language.<p>Mathematicians, engineers, and scientists regularly use a number of abstractions that your typical programmer doesn&#x27;t care about: integration, differential equations, linear algebra (including infinite-dimensional and tensors), coordinate systems, statistical distributions, etc, etc. These abstractions are almost never considered during language design so you spend hours writing glue code to achieve the simplest of tasks. Unless you have a Mathematica license.<p>Example: you&#x27;re writing a finite element code. The &quot;meat and potatoes&quot; of the problem involve putting a differential equation into weak form and evaluating a bunch of integrals to compute matrix elements. Mathematica can represent and display those elements using proper mathematical notation, it can find analytic AND numeric solutions, it can hold off on substituting variables until the last second (or elegantly substitute different sets of values for different problems), it can visualize all of this in a dozen different ways without worrying about indices and sampling rates, and it can generate code if you&#x27;re feeling trusting that day. Now you want to evaluate convergence for a bunch of different meshing strategies. Not a problem: Mathematica can interpolate your meshed solutions to whatever order you want in whatever dimension using a single command and it can take differences between those interpolations and integrate with another. You never have to notice that the mesh points don&#x27;t line up. You never have to spend a second thinking about multi-dimensional quadrature on tetrahedral meshes. Now you want to compare statistics about the mesh graph to an analytic model you found using Bayes Theorem in 3D parameter space and solve for the maximum likelihood values? Again, you don&#x27;t have to worry about meshing or gradient descent or how to put least squares into matrix form. Just write the high-level math and let Mathematica worry about the rest. Now you want to use a simplified PDE model with an analytic solution and compare that to the numerical solutions? Mathematica can solve the PDE <i>and</i> take care of all the interpolation and quadrature needed to integrate the square difference with the numerical solutions. Then it can plot all these errors and update the plot automatically as you go back and change things. The value-addition vs a general purpose language is off the charts.<p>None of that translates to the process of writing another Mathematica, since the algorithms Mathematica lets you abstract away are precisely the things you would need to worry about to implement another Mathematica.<p>Mathematica = A + B = (1000s of algorithms that mathematicians, scientists, and engineers care about, all coded with a common interface) + (syntax that elegantly glues them together)<p>B is comparatively easy and interesting if you like languages -- Mathematica&#x27;s language is LISP on steroids.

The main reason it isn&#x27;t done today is not that it isn&#x27;t useful, but that it&#x27;s too slow to run e.g. bcrypt on the client without native browser APIs. WebCrypto will change that by adding PBKDF2 as a module accessible from JavaScript.<p>The main reason we encourage people to use key stretching algorithms on the server is that, if an attacker gets access to a database of password digests that aren&#x27;t very strong, they can trivially be reversed.<p>Doing this key stretching or &quot;password scrambling&quot; on the client side simply moves the processing burden from the server to the client.

Too often I have seen systems that treat money as floats, or have primitives that allow the creation and destruction of money. Accounting and banking have their own special set of rituals.<p>I think most programmers can understand this if they think about it a bit. Think about the lower quartile of coders [1] you know jumping in and writing a system to handle many kinds of money, including a novel kind that is poorly understood. Now put them under conditions of massive growth, conditions in which there is a shit-ton of money, fiat and crypto, arriving and departing in buckets.<p>I once saw a cartoon where a bank teller is saying to a worried-looking customer, &quot;I&#x27;m sorry sir, there&#x27;s not enough money in your account.

Sure you&#x27;ll maybe negate the overly high proportion of extreme votes, but I don&#x27;t think that effect is large. I did once take the top films on IMDB and remove the extreme votes, and the effect was marginal - a few films shuffled a place or so. In exchange, if you use the median, you could have polarising films - like Twilight, having their ratings change markedly over time, as people decide to start warring over it and the numbers swamp the small number of ambivalents.<p>For your other point, there will be voting patterns for various demographics and certain groups of people prefer certain movies. But I think the phenomenon I&#x27;m describing is a bit too extreme to be merely a bunch of old women disproportionately taking a dislike to Ikiru and then rushing onto the internet to tell the world they hate it.

That cluster runs a virtual appliance who&#x27;s job is to watch a given Bitcoin address for payments.  If it sees a payment it either starts an instance or resets a counter to keep an instance running.  Payments by users are taken by the pool operator.  The pool then starts micro drips to the instance, in most cases half a cent or so.<p>The pool I&#x27;m going to run will be at stackmonkey.com.  If a provider shuts off their controller, something crashes, or there&#x27;s a rig failure, only a small percentage of the total number of instances will be affected.  Payments won&#x27;t matter because the instance costs are so low, and the drip can be turned off when the appliance stops responding to the pool controller.<p>OpenStack makes this handy because it handles all the heavy lifting for starting and stoping instances, doing network setup, images, instance sizes, etc.<p>Initial audience for this low trust pool will be hackers, developers, testers, tor nodes, individuals, etc.  Very low cost, highly ephemeral instances.<p>There&#x27;s a video here: <a href=""https://vimeo.com/86717476"" rel=""nofollow"">https://vimeo.com/86717476</a>",1393290765

Whether threads are implemented by way of native threads on the underlying platform (as in JRuby, current CPython or MRI), or green threads in the runtime (as in old MRI, etc.), and, in the latter case, whether the green threads are mapped to native threads on an N:1 (as in old MRI) or M:N (as in the main Erlang implementation) model are implementation details.<p>> For example Python has the notion of destructors in the language, the reference implementation having a GC based on reference counting, so when implementing it on top of the JVM/CLR or whatever platform that doesn&#x27;t do reference counting, that&#x27;s at least one feature that can&#x27;t work.<p>Sure, it could, since you could obviously (at the cost of making interop harder) write a Python implementation with its own garbage collector that ran on the JVM or CLR. You might choose to sacrifice portability for better interop with the languages the platform was designed for, but that&#x27;s a choice.<p>> Django that says it runs on Jython but nobody mentions that Django needs the MySQL client written in C and won&#x27;t work with the pure version<p>Seems to me that&#x27;s a problem either with Django or the pure python MySQL driver, but not with the Python language.<p>> Anybody that is fantasizing about Python having a usable implementation other than CPython is delusional.<p>Perhaps; I&#x27;m less familiar with Python&#x27;s other implementations than with Ruby&#x27;s (particular JRuby) which is definitely usable, and definitely uses native threads without a GIL.",1393290488

Is that what the invasion of Iraq was all about?</i><p>There is absolutely no reason, other than bickering and incompetence, that the European powers couldn't be operating an airlift capability equivalent to or better than the US C17 Globemaster fleet. If we were we could have saved countless lives in the wake of the Asian tsunami. The <i>only</i> people in the world able to undertake a massive logistical undertaking at short notice is the USAF.<p>Militaries do an LOT other than blowing stuff up.",1224226435

335382,comment,335263,335313,0,0,ScottWhigham,,,"I'm not sure this is good advice. You have six months of savings - six months of savings for where you live in Australia. What does that translate to Bay Area money though? In other words, what is the cost of living increase? I'd assume it's a minimum of 10% and maybe as high as 35%. That's going to reduce your run rate. Also, how much will it cost to move out there? I'd assume that would be two months worth of your savings....",1224226273

My main product is wyUpdate, a partially open source partially for-profit updater program. The post I put up this morning explains it best ( http://wyday.com/blog/2008/open-source-wyupdate-keep-your-users-up-to-date/ ).<p>The 4 years I've been working on the start-up hasn't been continuous - I've been simultaneously earning my bachelor's degree in electrical engineering. That's my excuse for ignoring the Paul Graham credo: ""release early, release often.""<p>What do you guys think? Namely, what do you think about me releasing a Windows program in the era where Web 2.0 and Cloud Computing are the buzzwords of choice?<p>What do you hate?",1224225734

But if you figure an angel invests 20% of his money in startups, and the stock market comes along and reduces his total net worth by 20%, how much is he going to invest now? How much if he invests 10% in startups and the stock market hits him for 30%?<p>It may not be 0, because he may have had other expenses and investments that he prioritizes angel investing over, but it probably won't still be 20%. The total dollar amount he'll be willing to stick into high-risk investments will probably decrease.<p>I'm talking on average, of course. Each individual will vary according to their net worth, lifestyle, investment philosophy, etc.",1224225594

You have to test how they actually ARE, say by looking at white blood cell count, cortisol levels, memory retention, problem solving, and compare different baseline levels of sleep on such terms.<p>What I would like to know is what length of sleep a sedentary adult needs, whether that need N can be met by say (N' < N/2) at night and (N'' < N/2) during a day nap, and what (hopefully positive) affect can be had on reducing that need by say, exercise, diet, or sun exposure.",1224225506

335368,comment,335096,335248,0,0,davidw,,,"> I certainly am not going to lawyer up aggressively.<p>I think what they're saying is that you and your partner <i>both</i> go see the lawyer, together, and sit down and work out the details, not that <i>you</i> get a lawyer on your own.  The idea is that you first discuss what kind of terms you want, and then the lawyer helps make that a legal reality, and maybe helps you think of things that you hadn't considered.<p>By the way, it's an inspiring story: the fact that you didn't ""get rich quick"" makes it more real, something anyone could do by trying hard and with a bit of luck.",1224225276

Wowsers.<p>It's not so much control of the Middle East oil resources as stability of the resources so those who actually depend on them (that is, not the US) don't go belly up.<p>Like I said, we have options.

I mean, post a roundly ridiculous, off the cuff, nationalistic comment and expect something similar in return, no?<p>If you want to get serious, I'm kind of sick of this ""But the US doesn't need the oil in Iraq anyway"" argument. I'm sure you know as well as anyone else around these parts that it's not about required resources, it's about control of resources, which in turn provides desired leverage.",1224224009

You want respect - get on the field.<p>So we have to start a war or something to get respect? Is that what the invasion of Iraq was all about?<p>> We don't argue that it's right, but let's look at the alternatives. China? Russia? The EU? No one? Yeah right.<p>Why does any one nation have to be nominate itself as the sheriff? I haven't seen much clamour for the US to exercise military power recently, more the opposite.<p>In truth I don't think the US has anywhere near as much power as it thinks. Most times it has tried to exert that power it has backfired. When you have about 20-25% of world GPD and you try to continually exercise more than 50% of the control something has to give.",1224223744

In bad time, the downturn does exist. People do not want to work in startup because there are higher risk than before and you can hardly raise money with less share exchange.",1224223594

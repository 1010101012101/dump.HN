This is particularly true for big-ticket items.<p>> That PPS is a more trustworthy metric than PPC.<p>Yes, true, but only for sales that follow directly from an advertisement, with no intervening time or context changes.<p>I agree with the basic argument the PPS is more reliable and meaningful, but it would be worthwhile to know how many sales follow directly from an initial advertising exposure, as opposed to a more complex decision-making process.<p>Consider the diamond campaign waged by De Beers described in another HN thread today. The advertising costs were high, but the goal was to change consumer perceptions over a period of decades (and successfully). This is far removed from the model we're discussing, essentially an impulse purchase -- the De Beers campaign wasn't directly correlated with diamond sales at all.<p>My point is that not all advertising can be shoehorned into a directly trackable purchase, yet those other kinds of advertising might still be valuable.",1363769562

5406187,comment,5403988,5403988,5,0,gfodor,,,"Ah, another thread full of bitter men who do not want to buy a diamond because they are ""worthless.""<p>I bought the girl a diamond because she wanted a diamond. It makes her happy. She says it makes her smile every day. That's ""worthless"", huh? If that is worthless then find me something that makes her so happy that isn't worthless and I would have bought that instead. But there is no such thing, for her. For some girls, yes, they do not want diamonds. (But I assure you, there is something they want that you will label as ""irrational"" and ""worthless"", too.) But many girls do, and men buy them for them not because they are stupid and irrational but because they are in love and because it will make the person they love happy. Life is too short to view every dollar spent as an investment and every purchase justifiable onto some balance sheet or long-term plan based upon prudent thinking. What do we work for, after all, than to earn the ability to do what we want with our money? And what better way to use that money than to make those we love happy?<p>The bottom line is diamond rings and all that nonsense will continue to be a thing as long as it makes girls happy to have one. It could be it makes them happy because it reminds them of their husband's commitment. It could be because it reminds them of the time in their lives of their engagement. It could be because it is just shiny and nice to look at. It could be because it might be the nicest thing they own and the biggest sacrifice a person ever made, just to make them happy. According to this thread, the only reason a girl wants a diamond is because she is a selfish person who wants to wave it around her friends and show she is better than them. That's a very sad perspective and shows a lack of understanding.<p>If you want to figure out how to get diamonds to go away you need to figure out something that will have the same effect on women that diamonds do, or you need to somehow convince millions of women to no longer feel the way they do about diamond rings and the meaning behind them. Getting up and yelling about it being a poor investment and irrational and all makes it fairly clear you do not understand why women are so obsessed with diamonds in the first place.<p>The only reason the focus is on diamonds is because of the high price tag, not because there is some inherent moral argument being made about the nature of purchasing things irrationally because you simply want to do something nice for someone you love. I'm sure you have plenty of things you want that you don't need, but somehow you are able to compartmentalize them because they are a) not as expensive as a diamond or b) serve some ""function"" beyond being a shiny rock. Good for you. But really, if you want to argue about ethics and morals in consumer choices, the price tag a person pays relative to the ""intrinsic value"" of the object so desired should not be a part of the equation. To me, I don't give a damn what the ""intrinsic value"" of a diamond is on the market, I give a damn what the ""intrinsic value"" of a diamond (specifically <i>the</i> diamond I purchased) is to the person I gave it to. And in my case you will hardly find a larger gap between price and intrinsic value (in my favor) than probably anything else I've purchased.",1363769452

5406157,comment,5393588,5404075,1,0,dalke,,,"Palliative care, which is what we are talking about now, is different than treating a disease. Standard medicine is well aware that tending to the emotional needs of the patients, including providing an on-call chaplain at some hospitals, helps make some patients feel better. Hospital chaplains have been around for a long time, and are not specific to alt.med, nor did the practice of providing access to religious support derive from alt.med.<p>That said, it's interesting that the paragraph you quoted doesn't mention the word ""prayer"" at all. It refers to ""spiritual well-being."" Earlier in that page it pointed out that spirituality ""is often expressed through religion and/or prayer"""", but it doesn't say that it's the prayer which leads to any change.<p>More specifically, it also says that ""Meditation, twelve-step work (as practiced in Alcoholics Anonymous and similar groups), and seeking meaning in life all involve spirituality. Even simple practices such as silent observation, listening, or gratitude can become part of an open-ended spirituality that can infuse everyday life. Some people express their spirituality by spending time with nature, doing creative work, or serving others.""<p>It notably doesn't say (as you suggest) that prayer is an effective method to reduce stress, nor does it say that prayer is any more effective than 'spending time with nature' or 'doing creative work.' (To that list I'll add 'talking with a counselor.')<p>So I don't understand your point. That page doesn't show that prayer ""works"", except perhaps as pallative treatment for those who already believe that prayer is effective. But then that's not very surprising, is it? And other forms of palliative care would also be effective. Perhaps even more effective?<p>You must certainly acknowledge that ""spiritual well-being"" as given on that page is a rather broad term. Telling a patient to spend time relaxing in the mountains, as an example of spending time with nature, is not specific to alt.med. Indeed, a century ago, going to a spa in the countryside, where one could get away from the stresses of life was the common treatment for well-off people with tuberculosis, 'consumption', and other hard-to-cure diseases. So it's not like these suggestions are foreign or even recent to standard medicine.<p>(Though once we figured out how to cure tuberculosis, this treatment for tuberculosis disappeared. That's why palliative care is different than treatment.)<p>Also, don't you find the circular reasoning rather odd? As you quoted, ""those who reported spiritual well-being were able to cope more effectively with terminal illnesses and find meaning in their experience"", but as I quoted in the second paragraph, ""seeking meaning in life [involves] spirituality."" In a rather direct sense it says that those who seek meaning are more able to find meaning in their experience. Should anyone be surprised about that?<p>I also think the idea that one should ""find meaning in their experience"" is a biased term. What meaning is there in going through cancer treatment? Other than the obvious - a combination of genetic and environmental factors, plus random chance lead to having cancer, and it's pain in the ass to get cancer treatments - why should anyone seek a deeper meaning?<p>Of course, if you think the universe is constructed around you, perhaps because there's a God or universal spirit who intercedes on your behalf and 'works in mysterious ways', then perhaps thought, prayer, and reflection might help revel that hidden meaning, or perhaps help you accept that it's all for the best. But then it's rather biased metric, because those who don't think there is meaning to cancer will also tend be those who don't have a religious or spiritual faith.",1363768394

What ""rights"" do you have when you're alone?

I do have one or two more reasons to add to your list.<p>1. <i>Cognitive dissonance</i> reduction: he spent so much, so to avoid cognitive dissonance he's going to tell himself she's worth it. Helps keep marriages together. It is the same reason that hazing ritual happen in college and why secret societies have all sorts of strange initiation rituals, often hazardous or difficult.
- Easy way to test this would be RQ: Do couples with relatively more expensive wedding rings for their income level(s) stay together longer than those who spend less on their wedding ring (controlling for other initial ritual costs like the wedding, although I suspect similar effects and interactions there).<p>2. <i>Symbolic Interactionism</i> This suggests that the initiation rites are there precisely to bind people together socially. It's a social-level theory explanation for all of the rites of passage rituals which are common in mating-couple pairing cultures in humans (and probably other primates, for that matter). A big token like this is a constant reminder of the commitment, and the meaning ascribed to this again helps with the ongoing project.

(Also, there's no chance law enforcement would be advancing your strict short-leash interpretation of that exception, in actual practice. They'd try for an expansive idea of what 'cybersecurity crimes' are happening, and wait for the courts to maybe later snap them back. That amounts in most cases to a 'free look', because those whose information is 'shared' will usually never know unless prosecuted.)<p>Of course, even without CISPA, these parties were able to share information just fine. And if say law enforcement had wanted other Boston ISPs or cellular networks to reveal if they'd ever seen any similar traffic, CISPA would have allowed them to assert a 'good faith' interest in investigating an ongoing CFAA 'cybersecurity crime', and request more potential evidence from usage logs and customer accounts. All through immunized 'sharing', rather than formal subpoenas.<p>You've made the claim: ""[CISPA is] specifically restricted from applying to Aaron Swartz-style ToS violations, or, for that matter, to intellectual property misappropriation"".<p>As documented above, the Swartz case wasn't about ToS violations, so CISPA would be used to collect evidence against alleged future Swartz-like activities.<p>And I've asked for where CISPA specifically excludes IP crimes; you've not provided any reference to related bill text or expert interpretation. Maybe it exists; you haven't provided it when requested. Where did you get that idea?<p>Until I see that, forgive me for not accepting your repetitive assertions about what CISPA is really ""about"", when the available bill text and trusted legal experts suggest otherwise.",1363766668

Although I deal with only a fraction of the GitHub traffic that Jeremy does, it's still demoralising at times, and dominates the effort I spend on OSS. It's the equivalent of every widget owner having the CEO's home number, and it being culturally normal to call to discuss any problem or even idea for minor tweak.<p>One possibility I've wondered about is making the GitHub issues list read-only, except for project maintainers. Then bug reports and feature requests would go initially only to the project's forum or IRC channel, which has much less maintenance cost, because threads or conversations don't need to be ""closed"". If they attract enough attention (because they describe a painful bug, or a really good idea), then a project maintainer is likely to notice and choose to file an issue.",1363766613

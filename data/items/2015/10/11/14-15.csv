It&#x27;s a bit pricey, probably $1100, but it&#x27;s it worth it right?&quot; -- that&#x27;s a much more transparent decision than anything written in a handbook.<p>This handbook doesn&#x27;t preclude that; it just says that this is the minimum that every employee can expect without having to wonder what is reasonable or not. Every company, large or small, has exceptions to policy, and the handbook is just a way of making those guidelines common knowledge, so everyone can feel comfortable knowing what expectations are completely reasonable and what will require special consideration.<p>> so why do they feel the need to specify how many weeks of vacation you should have taken in the year leading up to the sabbatical you earn in your fifth year of employment?<p>One disadvantage of &#x27;unlimited&#x27; vacation policies are that expectations are oftentimes unclear, and many people end up taking far less vacation time than they otherwise would or could. This disproportionately impacts women and minorities in the industry for a variety of reasons[0]. People who are used to being marginalized in the workplace (not necessarily at their current job, but in the past) tend to be less aggressive with their demands, even when their demands are completely within reason.<p>Furthermore, for people looking at long-term planning (people with families, or people with other obligations outside work), having clear expectations for not just the short term but the long term as well is a <i>huge</i> bonus.<p>[0] This isn&#x27;t an argument not to have unlimited vacation policies at all - just that, if you do, you should be conscious of mitigating this effect.",1444575590

What then? Surely, economy would collapse: Goods won&#x27;t be purchased and people producing them would be fired. Those fired would not have money to buy goods. The demand would decrease. More people will be fired. And so on until last human being dies of hunger.<p>I would even argue that in developed world we&#x27;ve already reached the limit and the economy is kept afloat only by desperate measures such as whipping up the consumption using ads, lowering the productivity by employing large numbers of paper pushers and so on.",1444575578

A population in risk of genocide has to literally fight for it&#x27;s life. If Jews the capabilities of supporting a continuous armed resistance the Holocaust could&#x27;ve been avoided (this isn&#x27;t claiming that the end result would&#x27;ve resulted in less deaths) because it would be much less likely that the Germans could&#x27;ve as easily transported as many Jews at that much of an ease during the final solution.<p>The final solution was so unthinkable that even the Jews didn&#x27;t believe it until the news broke out in the final year of the war in Europe, the majority of the Jews were transported from ghettos and work camps and thought that they are just are being put into a new camp, the level of deception that was put into the final solution was truly unbelievable including letting the &quot;red-cross&quot; (still no clear if this was a show or the actual red-cross) visit the Jews in the big Ghettos before transferring them to the death camps to further pacify and calm down the population.<p>So yes arming at risk populations might make a huge difference in the end even if you only consider that difference to be the way they died rather than the pure numbers, but in modern times it&#x27;s also an issue. Tribal genocide (which sadly being going since even before colonial times) cannot be just as easily compared to the Holocaust, if you are the population too much you might still get a Genocide in which the original at risk population isn&#x27;t the victim but now the perpetrator so you end up with constantly fueling an ever shifting conflict.",1444575297

There are several ways to get a free markets, some of which lead to healthy competition between many many providers, and some of which lead to near-monopoly.<p>Basically, it all starts at the handling of the last mile.  There are <i>many</i> last miles to cover, and it doesn&#x27;t make technical sense to duplicate them.  So, one solution is have the state build the lines, then lease them to providers at regulated rates that allow small providers (10-100 subscribers) to use them at rates no worse than the big boys.  That solution tends to lead to the &quot;free and fair&quot; market you seek.<p>Another solution would be to minimise state intervention (because &quot;free market&quot;), and thus let providers build their own last miles —and lease them if they want to.

10369432,comment,10368275,10368275,0,0,jinushaun,,,"Like everyone here has already mentioned: knowledge and practice.<p>Knowledge of cooking was passed down from generation to generation via schools, guilds and families. We stand on the shoulders of giants. Thousands of years of trial and error passed down. People measure by sight, sound, touch and smell. For example, there are multiple ways to guess steak doneness. Simmering is visually different from boiling which is different from a rolling boil. If you&#x27;re frying something in a pan, you can guess the temperature by sound. If you&#x27;re making a stew or braise, it&#x27;s done when the meat breaks apart. Doesn&#x27;t matter what the cookbook says about exact times because environment and cooking equipment is different for everybody. Water boils before 100 C at high elevation. I moved to an area with high humidity in the summers and all my baking recipes from home failed.<p>With practice, you also build an intuitive sense of doneness. For example, I&#x27;ve cooked enough &quot;black on the outside, raw on the inside&quot; chicken to know how hot the heat should be and how long it should take--even without a thermometer or a timer. Like others have mentioned, sometimes you just have to cook a proxy item or sacrifice a piece.<p>One of the big differences between new cooks, and experienced cooks is that people who have cooked for a while are constantly tasting, touching and inspecting their food. New cooks tend to follow recipes word for word and only taste at the end. Then they get surprised when something is under/over cooked and under/over seasoned.<p>Lastly, I think previous generations had different expectations of consistency and quality. Modern society is hyper-precise. Traditional recipes have a huge margin for error.",1444574846

Recent research in physics shows that this proof directly implies the Grand Unification of the Standard Model with Quantum Gravity in its physical interpretation and conversely the existence of the standard model of particle physics shows that nature applies this proof of the four colour theorem at the most fundamental level, giving us a grand unified theory. In particular, we have shown how to use this theory to predict the Higgs Boson Mass [arXiv:0912.5189] with precision. Thus, nature itself demonstrates the logical completeness and consistency of the proof. This proof was first announced by the Canadian Mathematical Society in 2000. The proof appears as the twelfth chapter of the text book Graph Theory published by Orient Longman and Universities Press of India in 2008. This proof has also been published in the Euroacademy Series Baltic Horizons No. 14 (111) dedicated to Fundamental Research in Mathematics in 2010. Finally, the proof features in an exquisitely illustrated edition of The Four Colour Theorem published by Amazon in 2011. The Endowed Chair of the Institute of Mathematics in recognition of this achievement was bestowed in 2012.<p>#########################################<p>See also (<a href=""http://www.dharwadker.org/standard_model/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dharwadker.org/standard_model/</a>):<p>Title:  Grand Unification of the Standard Model with Quantum Gravity\nAuthor: Ashay Dharwadker<p>Abstract:<p>#########################################<p>We show that the mathematical proof of the four colour theorem [1] directly implies the existence of the standard model, together with quantum gravity, in its physical interpretation. Conversely, the experimentally observable standard model and quantum gravity show that nature applies the mathematical proof of the four colour theorem, at the most fundamental level. We preserve all the established working theories of physics: Quantum Mechanics, Special and General Relativity, Quantum Electrodynamics (QED), the Electroweak model and Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). We build upon these theories, unifying all of them with Einstein&#x27;s law of gravity. Quantum gravity is a direct and unavoidable consequence of the theory. The main construction of the Steiner system in the proof of the four colour theorem already defines the gravitational fields of all the particles of the standard model. Our first goal is to construct all the particles constituting the classic standard model, in exact agreement with &#x27;t Hooft&#x27;s table [8]. We are able to predict the exact mass of the Higgs particle and the CP violation and mixing angle of weak interactions. Our second goal is to construct the gauge groups and explicitly calculate the gauge coupling constants of the force fields. We show how the gauge groups are embedded in a sequence along the cosmological timeline in the grand unification. Finally, we calculate the mass ratios of the particles of the standard model. Thus, the mathematical proof of the four colour theorem shows that the grand unification of the standard model with quantum gravity is complete, and rules out the possibility of finding any other kinds of particles.<p>#########################################",1444574574

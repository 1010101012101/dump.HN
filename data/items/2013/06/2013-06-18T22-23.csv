I say that because of the studies it selectively cites and the conclusions they reach.<p>For example it&#x27;s fine to call a facial skin abrasion a &quot;head injury&quot; if  you are clear about that definition in the research.  It&#x27;s another thing to cite research about &quot;head injuries&quot; and helmet use without mentioning what they means by a head injury.<p>The article also fails to cite research that contradicts the authors bias.  Academic work such as Robinson&#x27;s longitudinal study of AU or numerous pieces in the British Medical Journal (as referenced at <a href=""http://www.boycottbell.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.boycottbell.com/</a> ) appear to have been carefully avoided.<p>For these reasons, and the fact that Bicycling Magazine is heavily funded  by helmet advertising, it would be naive not to see the advertising influence in this article which goes out of its way to appear to be educational.<p>The unfortunate result of this sort of &quot;journalism&quot; is that people with little cycling experience and no knowledge of epidemiology read it and assume it is true despite the fact that 98% of the world&#x27;s bicycling population don&#x27;t wear helmets and their incidence of true head injuries are uniformly lower among them than the US&#x27; helmeted riders.  Another downside to this propaganda is that many kids never take up cycling in the first place and many of those who do ride are afraid to venture outside of bike paths, sidewalks and super-low-traffic routes.<p>From a foreigner&#x27;s perspective this illustrates American&#x27;s naivete with  regards to sales and marketing and their relatively undeveloped bicycling ecosystem.  I for one hope both of those dysfunctional cultural attributes improve with the rising price of petrol.",1371596290

Or simply dramatically reduced?<p>For the sake of argument again, let&#x27;s say the Micro instance that is not being throttled by the Amazon hypervisor can handle 0.5% the sustained load of a i7 2600K.  That is, 1,000 static requests per second from nginx.<p>Then, just by conjecture, let&#x27;s say the throttling algorithm smashes the CPU allocation to 10% of its nominal maximum, thereby reducing our throttled micro instance&#x27;s capacity to 0.05% that of an i7 2600K.

SF has an unusually high number of extremely highly rated schools, a large number of middling ones, and a notable number of failing schools.<p>To see more about this, there&#x27;s a site called greatschools.net.  You can list the schools by API score (adjusted by expectations based on demographics as well).  What you&#x27;ll see is that SF has an unusual number of schools scoring 8, 9, and 10 out of 10.  Below that, there are plenty of decent performing schools.  And then, there are some 1&#x27;s and 2&#x27;s.  Pretty grim.<p>If you list schools in the suburbs, you&#x27;ll find a similar situation.  The big difference is that in the suburbs, you can convert a very high mortgage payment or rent into priority access for a top school.  If you can&#x27;t afford that, you&#x27;re stuck in middling or poor schools.<p>SF uses a lottery, where parents list their choices and then get an assignment.  If you only list highly in demand schools, you do risk getting a default assignment to a very low performing school across town (you can still get on wait lists).  These people often do leave.<p>Prop H would have recommended giving priority access to district residents.  It failed by a whisker.  Probably the most interesting thing it revealed is that voters in good school districts favor priority access for district residents, whereas residents in poor school districts don&#x27;t.  Yeah, huge surprise there.<p>I feel some ambivalence about this, because I do see advantages to neighborhood schools.  However, there was an article in reason magazine making a very surprising libertarian case for SF&#x27;s school lottery...<p><a href=""http://reason.com/archives/2006/04/01/the-agony-of-american-educatio"" rel=""nofollow"">http://reason.com/archives/2006/04/01/the-agony-of-american-...</a><p>Article is a little old, but I&#x27;d say schools have improved since it was written.",1371594881

The modern conception of biology rests directly on physics; evolution for example involves physical processes that affect the chemical reactions within mating animals--chemical reactions that rely directly on quantum mechanics.<p>Biology is still treated as a distinct science only as a form of abstraction-- because it would be practically impossible to study the mating habits of elk by studying the characteristics of the fermions and bosons that make up two elk. There are just too many starting conditions to measure and reactions to calculate. But certainly most biologists would consider themselves part of the same system of knowledge as physicists.<p>Likewise the concept of a separation between mind and body is dying, if it is not already dead. Today we might say that the mind is a behavior of the body, or rather that a particular set of actions by the body are collectively called &quot;mind&quot; by humans. The implications of this made headlines most recently in NIH&#x27;s rejection of the DSM V.<p>Ultimately all of what we call &quot;thoughts&quot; or &quot;stories&quot; are just patterns of information that emerge from the fundamental physical processes of the universe.

And over how much time?  500,000 requests in total over the course of a day?<p>nginx or any high-performance platform is designed to deliver hundreds of thousands of static responses in a second on high-performance hardware.  Even a micro instance, for all its infinitesimally tiny CPU power, can deliver a small fraction of that.  Let&#x27;s say for the sake of argument a micro instance provides 0.5% the performance of an i7 2600K.<p>Knowing that an i7 2600K can easily saturate a gigabit Ethernet connection with over 200,000 small responses per second [2], and knowing that it&#x27;s even easier to do so with large responses, we just have to be comfortable that our micro instance can handle your 500,000 requests per day.  0.5% of 200,000 rps is 1,000 rps.  With 1,000 rps, we could fulfill our entire day&#x27;s worth of 500,000 requests in 500 seconds.<p>Being #1 on the HN home page will yield sustained traffic in the realm of 10 to 30 requests per second.

Processes in cgroup A will get 90% of the CPU time, but it will not starve cgroup A because cgroup A will still get 10%.<p>This shares-based model also has a major effect when there isn&#x27;t contention. Shares-based resources are burstable. Even cgroup A (with 10 CPU shares) can use 100% of CPU if nothing else needs it.<p>This &quot;burstable&quot; nature can be good or bad. It&#x27;s good in the sense that most users will probably get more CPU than their shares guarantee most of the time. It&#x27;s bad because users can start expecting more than their shares guarantee and get a nasty surprise when resources get under contention.<p>It&#x27;s time to drop some analogies.<p>cgroups are very much like a highway with an HOV lane (or more): anyone can go very fast when there&#x27;s no contention. But, during rush hour, lanes get distributed as &quot;shares&quot; of the road to the HOV and non-HOV groups. Neither the HOV nor the non-HOV drivers get starved for road access (though responsiveness may not be equivalent, by design).<p>Traditional &quot;nice&quot; is like emergency vehicle traffic. An ambulance every now and then works fine as &quot;-20 nice&quot; traffic. But, if you filled the road with ambulances, it would starve normal traffic of roadway access.<p>RCTL is sort of like a person riding reserved right-of-way public transit. From the time the person hops on the train at point A to when they get off at point B, it will be the same duration any time of day. They don&#x27;t get to go faster during low-traffic times, but they also don&#x27;t have to worry about a significantly worse experience during rush hour.<p>Capsicum seems focused on intra-application isolation; I&#x27;m not sure how to compare it to other OS-level containers.",1371594544

No matter how you look at it... preparing food does take time. Maybe it doesn&#x27;t need to take hours every meal, but it still takes time. Shopping, prep, cleanup... it all takes some time. So what is so wrong with trading a fast McD&#x27;s burger for a fast nutrient shake? Or having a fast nutrient shake every morning instead of a bowl of cereal?<p>People talk as if they eat some gourmet meal surrounded by friends, 3 times a day, everyday and would miss that immensely if they drank nutrient shakes. Today I had cereal for breakfast and a Subway sandwich for lunch. Both cases I ate alone. I ate those things because I needed to eat, they were near me and I viewed them as the healthier choice given the options I had in front of me. Both of those meals could easily have been replaced with a filling shake and I would not have reduced my daily food pleasure. Tonight... tonight I will eat a nice meal. And enjoy it.",1371592870

Do any of the practices revealed recently seem designed to address that priority? An adversary capable of obtaining, maintaining, and deploying nuclear weapons would probably be capable of secure communications even in the face of PRISM, whether here or overseas. The most likely vector would be something like a submarine or a well-shielded shipping container, but if the plan did require agents in this country I doubt those would be discussing their plans on Facebook or over the phone.",1371592805

1708605,comment,1708338,1708338,0,0,ez77,,,"OK, I've been meaning to ask the HN community about this. Please share your thoughts.<p>Wouldn't it make a lot of sense for Google (et al) to have this sort of authentication <i>every</i> time you want to change your Google Accounts password? Isn't this a pretty safe way to prevent being locked out should someone gain access to your account?<p>You may be thinking about costs, but this could easily be a premium service I would gladly pay for! For instance, I could charge $10 to my account, which should allow me plenty of password changes in the future. An intruder may ""waste"" at most one SMS, since he would not have it and until then Google should not send you any additional SMSs. Does it make sense? If it does, you Googlers in here, please pass it on!<p>While we're at it... how about extending this to domain registrars? This would be even more critical. I must say it, I'm pretty paranoid and by now it clearly shows. I don't know how you guys have launched successful websites and cope with this lack of safety features. I know I'm rambling, but please speak your mind on this issue.<p>PS: I realize things are not so bad as they could be, that probably keyloggers are rather hard to plant, etc. But it wouldn't hurt to have these features, and the companies involved would only profit, both financially and in terms of reliability.",1284987535

We actually love Australia, and Melbourne is a wonderful city, but we do face certain disadvantages building a startup from here.

As long as you feel in control and are happy, who are we to say what's better than what?<p>Second, you are asking a question with a false premise. It's not either ""make a million and be a rock star"" or ""work a 9-5 job"". There are lots of entrepreneurs on here, just like yourself, who are also working jobs. Lots more that are on their own and just barely Ramen profitable. Lots more that are quite happy with having a cottage business.<p>There is a business and a hype around startups, no doubt. You see a lot of that here, although its usually sub-rosa.<p>It's the risk-taking superman story. There's a lot of drama. It's the simple cool idea or magic formula that made the weakling into the giant. Business porn. People selling emotion instead of a reality. Some folks trying to help that don't know what they're talking about, they just got lucky once. Some unlucky people who drew the wrong conclusions. Way, way too much fanboyism and hero worship. But that's okay -- startups are all about making a difference, and that usually entails lots of work and risk. As long as folks know the odds going in, why not stay positive about the whole thing? Our enthusiasm for startups doesn't mean that other choices are bad or wrong. Why wouldn't you be excited about the choices you make in life, no matter what they were?",1284987444

When I was 14, there was a civil war where I lived and the prices of everything shot up several hundred percent. The government intervened and subsidized food and gasoline. At the time, I was an A-student: I had the second highest grade in the state and was featured on both radio and television. A good kid by every measure .. BUT! I found a contact at a cigarette factory who would sell me cigarettes at 80% discount. He just meant to sell me a pack, because I was a ""rich kid"". I flipped him over to work for me.<p>At 14, I ran a cigarette cartel out of my grandmother's house supplying tens of shops and street vendors.<p>I didn't need the money. My father and all my older brothers and sisters were in America. I didn't do it for the money. I just did it because it was an opportunity.<p>With some of the money I made I bought a bicycle and decorated it at a carpet shop .. for some reason. I got that idea that, perhaps, draping the bicycle frame in velvet cloth would look more appealing than the bare metal. I took it to the carpet and curtains guy and told him what I wanted done. He was confused, but money is money, so he pimped out my bike in purple velvet; a pair of wheels befitting a dealer.<p>Every kid in town wanted my bike.<p>My second venture was bicycle upholstery. A cottage industry unheard of up to that point. I didn't make as much as I did in cigarettes, but to this day, you can go to my old hometown and see kids ride bikes draped in cloth.<p>You're just born with the bug, I guess.",1284987082

I always have an out clause that a. I get paid time and material for the documentation work and b. I retain the option of voiding the contract once documentation is complete and I have a more accurate picture. This way I can give them the price they are looking for but yet not commit to a situation that I am going to eat a bunch of free work to pull the project out, you also have to be very diligent about scope creep with a fixed price contract.<p>Until you are comfortable,you should stick to time and materials over fixed bid, they latter can really bite you in the ass if you are not careful. You should always look at fixed bid like the client saying:<p>""I want you to build this software that is going to provide me with unlimited upside profit, but I want to limit you upside profit for building it, but want you to take all the risk of failure.""<p>You should price a fixed bid accordingly, as you should be compensated for the client shifting the risk onto you. A lot of new (to freelancing) developers will basically take their hourly rate, estimate what it will take to build the project, add some buffer and that is the price they charge. This is a very bad way of arriving at the price, as it does not take into account the types of risk involved.<p>For example things like dependency on client personnel, gaps in schedule and deadline have to be factored in. Just doubling you rate or worse yet just charging you rate + buffer without doing proper risk analysis can put you in a really tight spot.<p>Start small with fixed bids and work you way up; build a repeatable process that scales and produces accurate estimate results. Track your (detailed) estimates and actual times and hone the process until you can get fairly accurate results. Estimates will never be a precision instrument, but you can generally get them close enough that you don't get you ass in a sling.",1284986920

I propose that DHS crack down hard on employers of illegal immigrants. To solve problem 2, they must coordinate with local unemployment agencies. DHS will arrest and deport illegal immigrants. For each illegal thus deported, the unemployment benefits of an American (maybe whoever has been on unemployment the longest) will be terminated and they will be ordered to report to work at the former employer of the illegal. Employing a formerly unemployed American will be part of the penalty for the employer of the illegal immigrant.<p>To induce cooperation among employers, we could create an amnesty program. Employers can report their illegal workers to DHS and avoid paying fines. Maybe DHS/Unemployment Office will even give extra help to minimize disruption to your business (i.e., no deportation until the day replacements are available).<p>[edit: to those downmodding, just curious.

However, the job or two I have had -- and the interactions I've had with comparable consulting clients -- in places structurally describable as ""enterprise"" left me with an enormous appreciation of how differently a lot of the labour force there operates.  Most of the people I worked with were strict 9-to-5ers of average intelligence who, over time, became highly knowledgeable, deeply entrenched maintenance experts in various legacy systems the company had, which in many cases dated back to the late 1980s;  ROI is ROI.  They were quite valuable to those companies, operationally.<p>However, they had been there 9, 10, 15, 20 years;  they had virtually no transferrable skill sets whatsoever.  When that technology does (did) go, so will their jobs, and they will (do) have an extremely difficult time finding another job in a competitive technology market at any place that does not specifically use those systems.   Even the folks who played more generally applicable roles like accounts payable analysis, audits, marketing, etc. often became idiosyncratic domain specialists in <i>that very company</i>'s very particular business process and very particular product and customer domain in ways that seemed to call into doubt their ability to shift into an analogous role in another place in time and space.<p>The zeitgeist of 1950-1990 at General Electric or Ford Motor Co. has passed;  it's not coming back, I fear.  If there's any advice I can give to people today so that they don't end up in this situation when they're 50, it's that you have to embrace this ""up or out"" approach we talk about so much here.  Unless you're willingly headed toward management and significant increases in compensation, preferably short-term and relatively liquid, you <i>need</i> to get out after a few years.  When I say management, I really do mean management;  one of the pathologies I have seen a lot is to give people of the above specimen doing the same kind of grunt work year-on-year managerial-sounding titles to justify further salary increases, but whose jobs still consist of procedures and processes that suffer from the above-mentioned liabilities.<p>But anyway, the company will not take care of you.

I know this is not the case for everyone. If you were meant for the quiet world of work life, then I strongly agree with you -- it's a surer path to financial security. If you weren't meant for it, then financial security won't matter very much -- you'll be miserable.",1284984440

Previously, I thought you meant ""unusually due to overcrowding the trains stopped as frequently as every other station [whereas usually they visit fewer stations than that]"".<p>I was trying to point out that stopping often is usual Underground behavior, thinking that you were assuming it wasn't.<p>}",1284984429

Just like we listen to anyone else.<p>But oddly enough, it's usually the entrepreneur that shares interesting things.  It's the person who goes out and does new and interesting things that finds new things to talk about.  Sometimes they're crap, sometimes they're brilliant...  But they're almost always new and interesting.<p>The '90k dev', by definition, is happy simply to get through the workday and pay his debts.  If he was reaching for more, he moves into the entrepreneur class.  Sure, they sometimes find nuggets and share them, but more often they either find nothing or don't share it.",1284984407

On the top of the hierarchy, above things such as family, love, wealth and self-esteem, there is self-actualization and self-expression. You have to express yourself somehow. Some people express themselves with music. Others write blogs. For many people, starting up your own business and do things they way you think they should be done is a way of self-expression. It's your thing. You have built it.",1284984029

In the case of int you can work around it using int[] but if you need more structure, like with a complex number type, or tuples, pairs, etc, the workarounds get really tedious. Basically what you can do is stuff it all into a large byte[] and deserialise on access. That's slow and kills productivity.",1284984016

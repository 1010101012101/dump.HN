And plus, you need to make the user somehow disclose what he sees on the screen, which may often look suspicious.<p>And what would an adversarial website do with these {visitedlinks, IP} tuples? Hit me with personalized ads or sell that modicum of my history to some ad company? Big shit, I hit the reset button on my router, and I get a new dynamic IP address from the ISP. The site now knows nothing.<p>These work more as proof-of-concepts. The inconvenience they require to be collected, paired with the limited utility of the results, makes for an unattractive attack vector.<p>I agree that if someone wants to target specifically you and knows something about you, they can put this class of exploits to a more threatening use, such as (if you&#x27;re at work) seeing if you&#x27;ve visited some company LAN URL. Or perhaps they can see if you&#x27;ve accessed the admin pages on some website they&#x27;re targeting, so they can determine if you have admin rights there.",1403657937

If you have $$$ available, what is an effective level effort someone should be putting into it.<p>- What are the most prevalent attacks being done against servers.

7941562,comment,7938149,7941367,12,0,daveasdf,,,"<i>This reeks of bull shit</i><p>The proof states that the C code of the kernel is a <i>refinement</i> of an high-level &quot;abstract&quot; specification of the kernel. This means that the C code only exhibits behaviours that are also exhibited by the high-level specification. The high-level specification (by construction) doesn&#x27;t have certain bad behaviours that you often see in C programs: NULL pointer dereferences, buffer overruns, signed integer overflow, etc. Thus this class of bugs is proven to be absent. A good primer is available at: <a href=""http://www.ertos.nicta.com.au/research/l4.verified/proof.pml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ertos.nicta.com.au/research/l4.verified/proof.pml</a><p>The original proof didn&#x27;t make any claims about the high-level behaviour of the kernel, such as security. So for instance, the original kernel might have had a bug where you set up a system so that two processes shouldn&#x27;t be able to communicate with each other, but after some unexpected sequence of API calls they form a communications channel between them.<p>NICTA in the following years after the initial proof carried out two security proofs: an integrity proof and an information flow proof. These proofs state that the capabilities possessed by a process determine (i) what other processes a particular process can modify; and (ii) what other processes the process can communicate with. Like the original proof, these security proofs (especially the second) have assumptions. In particular, they can only talk about parts of the system that are modelled. Timing channels, hidden CPU state, etc. not modelled by the proof may still allow information flow between processes, for instance.<p><i>Sorry, I don&#x27;t think you can claim you have a mathematical proof of the correctness of your kernel when you assume this much.</i><p>You need to assume <i>something</i>. Every operating system kernel makes these assumptions: seL4 is just explicit about them. Some of the assumptions are bigger than others (management of caches is a pain to get right and hard to test, for instance). Some assumptions remain just due to a lack of time, such as proving the initialisation code of the kernel.<p>Additionally, as time has gone on the assumptions have been reduced. For instance, the work of Thomas Sewell and Magnus Myreen mean that the compiler no longer needs to be trusted: <a href=""https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mom22/pldi13.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mom22/pldi13.pdf</a><p><i>And where is this proof? I can&#x27;t seem to find it anywhere on their web site.</i><p>The proof will be part of the open-source release. It consists of around 200,000 lines of Isabelle/HOL proof script, which is machine-checked. Anyone will be able to inspect/modify/check the proofs after the release.",1403656207

In my experience, those jobs don&#x27;t pay enough to attract/keep the level of talent they need nor are they given the autonomy to effect change on their own.<p>I agree with you here.  What I wrote there was careless -- I meant to lay most of the blame squarely at the feet of the overzealous and incompetent district IT directors and their staff.  I wrote &quot;admins&quot; when I was thinking of the people <i>in charge</i>.  The mostly incompetent admins certainly don&#x27;t help but they aren&#x27;t at the root of the problem.  You&#x27;re correct that it&#x27;s hard to attract competent help at the salaries public school districts pay.<p>And based on my friends&#x27; experiences, I agree with your list of structural problems.

When a teacher is teaching a computer science class that requires installing new libraries and executable every other week, they should be given admin rights or else the computer pre-installed with all needed programs (that <i>never</i> happens in my friends&#x27; schools).  They can&#x27;t even follow a nationally standardized curriculum due to their IT depts&#x27; obstructionism, not only because they can&#x27;t get the right software installed, but also because their kids can&#x27;t access the various Google-related projects (i.e, Google docs) since all Google logins are blacklisted.<p>It&#x27;s absolutely ridiculous and it infuriates me.  These are motivated teachers who want to teach students who desperately need to learn, and they&#x27;re being actively blocked <i>by their own district policies</i>.  It&#x27;s maddening for me to hear about these things.<p><i>Ideally</i>, they&#x27;d be given root accounts on Linux machines as in MarcScott&#x27;s enlightened district, but I think my friends would be happy to just get Python installed on their kids&#x27; computers.",1403656035

It&#x27;s called famine and has been a tremendous regulator of human overpopulation.<p>Maybe we can beat famine back forever. But I&#x27;m not counting on it. The whole situation is actually pretty tenuous. You don&#x27;t see a lot about it on the news, but I understand the Horn of Africa has been experiencing massive famine over the past several years and hundreds of thousands have died from lack of nourishment. From an outside (rather than personal) perspective, this is just part of the cycle. In the first world we have beat famine back over the past century and the third world has enjoyed much of the benefit of this as they import much of their grain staples. But, we have sucked the aquifers dry, damned up most of the rivers and overallocation the water, are running short of essential nutrients like phosphorous and the whole thing is oil based. So, I am guessing in spite of massive efforts, the cycle of famine re-appears around the world again. Maybe next time around we can make our political/social systems a bit more efficient and forward looking which is, in my opinion, the only way to eliminate famine forever. But I&#x27;m not necessarily counting on that either.",1403655540

So any empirical claim about individual-level data should be taken <i>ex ante</i> with a big grain of salt and evaluated carefully; especially in a heavily politicized field like economics where data is scarce and motivated reasoning reigns.<p>Take, for instance, the graph you cite [1], which cites Kitov and Kitov (2013) [2] along with the US census bureau as a source. The problem is, what that paper provides is not an empirical dataset but a <i>microfounded model</i> for predicting individual income --with all the problematic epistemological/overfitting caveats that they come with. Presenting that graph as an empirical fact and not as a debatable modeling exercise is quite misleading.<p>Besides, as others have pointed out, all the links you provide discuss income, not wealth (and no, their arguments/reasoning about income do not readily/trivially translate to wealth, as you commented below). If you are interested, check out the work of Cheryl Doss [3], who has conducted <i>actual</i> empirical work about the differences between household and individual equality in Ecuador, Ghana and India.<p>(PD: Oh wow even their claims about changing family structure in that blog [4] is disturbingly model-dependent. Much is made about the percentage of single-person households following an S-shaped curve, inflecting at 1968. However, they fit a <i>sigmoid</i> to what is a patently linear trend in the total number of single-person households beginning in 1950, and extrapolate back to 1900 despite having only two data points for that period.

Some may call it a lack of faith, but in my opinion it was more a turning away from the hard, crude methods of theoretical physics into a mystical realm of broad intuition.</i><p>In my own field of network security, I think that&#x27;s largely true: we have a lot of analytical tools that we haven&#x27;t applied sufficiently well, largely because people are not interested or educated in the sorts of theoretical tools we could apply (ML or graph theory, for example).<p>How well this applies to theoretical research is outside my expertise, though...",1403654559

7941474,comment,7938491,7938491,5,0,saurik,,,"A question which no one has asked yet: what are the fees? Alipay charges a flat 3% while Stripe normally (for credit cards) charges 2.9%+$0.30. The variable cost to Stripe from a credit card processor is (of course) lower than 2.9% (so Stripe has a margin), 3% is (clearly) not (the fixed $0.30 only helping for small transactions). Will Stripe be charging more (variable, to have a margin) and/or less (fixed, to pass on the lack of a fixed interchange fee to customers) than its usual credit card processing fees when a customer is using Alipay? (An answer may also shine some light on whether Alipay is profit sharing with Stripe to get Stripe&#x27;s support or if Stripe is being forced to charge on top of Alipay to get access to their users.)",1403654453

What evidence do you have to support your claim that Google is not happy with people having multiple accounts? Because the variety of ways Google <i>helps</i> you have multiple accounts is pretty strong evidence they are OK with this.<p>> Google did make a significant effort to require real names on Google+ (and by extension youtube / gmail).<p>Your &quot;by extension&quot; is false. YouTube never had the real names push like G+/gmail did.

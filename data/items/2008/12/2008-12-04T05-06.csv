385363,comment,384606,385312,0,0,bokonist,,,"Here is one:<p><i>Large organizations will start to do worse now, though, because for the first time in history they're no longer getting the best people.</i><p>I believe this statement to be false.  Sampling from my college class and my smart hometown friends, the most common careers are, in order: 1) Law School/Med School 2) Wall St. 3) Consulting 4) Government 5) Academia 6) non-profit 7) other large corporation 8) small business.  Perhaps 1% are working for a startup.<p>This dominance by large organizations is historically weird.  For most of American history, the goal of an ambitious person was to own his own business or farm.  The really ambitious would aim to turn that small business into an empire.  Statistically, the average firm size was far, far smaller in 1900, so most ambitious people would be working for small businesses.  Anecdotally, my great-grand parents mostly ran a business or were self-employed.  But my father and uncles were mostly ""organization men"", as are most of my peers.<p>I think relative to 1960, people today are more likely to work for small organizations.  But the ""organization man"" economy of the 60's was a creation of the New Deal and World War II.  We're still trying to unwind the consolidation of that era.",1228369627

Your last point is probably the most important one, and in my book that's an acceptable trade off.<p>One question.  What's the speed of updates?  I know techmeme wants to be the place where you go immediately when a news story breaks out.  Would that be a problem (only computational I suppose)?",1228369508

385357,comment,384775,384775,0,0,eterno,,,"I think distribution is the key. You built a good product and ppl like it, that does not mean they will start using it. (Welcome to the real world, by the way).<p>To make it very clear, there are only 4 things you can do to tackle distribution.<p>1. SEO - Will not work in your case because it typically works best were large amounts of original content is getting generated. (think ugc)<p>2. SEM - Will again not work in your case because lifetime value of visitor is not much. Plus conversion rates are low with extremely low deal size. (Let me know if any of this is not clear).<p>3. Widgets - dont think how this will work for you.<p>4. Go B-to-B - I think this is the best option available for you right now. Essentially offer this as a service to hosting companies and domain registrars. Charge them a usage fees or an ROI rate. But this will require some real world busines development where the rules of the internet do not apply. If your tool is good, it could also be a nice little acquisition target.",1228369321
385356,comment,385323,385345,0,0,kwamenum86,,,"This is purely anecdotal evidence but pretty much everyday in New York I see people watching video on iPods.<p>Good point about iTunes but I would be reluctant to use iTunes sales figures to determine the distribution of media on the iPod.  If you look at the total number of iPods sold and use that figure to calculate the total amount of memory in iPods sold, then you look at iTunes sales, you can reasonably conclude that a lot of the memory on iPods is being filled outside of the iTunes store.<p>Again, anecdotal evidence, but I have only known 2 people in my life who bought media from the iTunes store regularly.  Everyone else I know gets their media elsewhere.",1228368863

I mean... it seems like ""hook-up application"" is logically the most common use of that technology.<p>Can't you set Loopt to only show you your friends, though?

I see people using the iPod for video literally everyday.<p>""most of the models have far more storage than necessary for people's collections""<p>Again I am not so sure because video can take up a lot of space and some people me) have a lot of songs.<p>One angle the article left out is the number of clones on the market that match all of the iPod's features and start at 40 bucks.  The only thing companies can't touch is the app store but for 40 bucks these clones could be killers.",1228367383

But I've also found that this is mostly true when I'm working on the same project for 50 hours/week.

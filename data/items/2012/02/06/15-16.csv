We have an entire infrastructure of schools to educate people regarding healthy and unhealthy choices - if people choose something else who are you or I to say they shouldn't consume it?<p>I would argue electrical wiring or other infrastructure is no different. If it poses no threat to my neighbors' property or infringe on their rights in any way, why shouldn't I be free to proceed? I'm not saying that I'm not glad that there are standards I can expect a contractor to meet - I just don't think they should be a requirement. In the computing world we have POSIX - it's great if an OS implements it, but a very popular one which has succeeded in the market is not beholden to the standard (though at one time implemented it).<p>Unfortunately, this is why I'm also against universal health care. There is a huge conflict of interest. People who make stupid dietary decisions are going to use the majority of health care resources available. It is unlikely that someone making smart, healthy choices will be able to get the same benefit. While I think a basic level of care would benefit all people, I am unwilling to act as an enabler for people who have no interest in looking out for their own best interest.<p>There needs to be an underlying expectation that people are responsible for their own choices and actions. People need to be more active in their decision making, not have choices taken away from them.",1328543837

The Nazi dictatorship was just one of many unjust regimes in the past. No reason why we cannot compare it to others, past or present. They did kill millions of jews, communists, gypsies and gays in concentration camps, but lots of other regimes have killed millions of people too.<p>Now, as to how the British government compares to the Nazi dictatorship. Well, they have even worse mass surveillance program (CCTV) that the Nazi's had. And the British had invaded and enslaved more countries during their colonial era than Germany ever did. And they are responsible for lots of subsequent wars in their old colonies, since they used ""divide and conquer"" tactics (establishing artificial buffer states, playing parts of the population against the other, et al) to ensure continued dependance and instability after de-colonizing them (from India-Pakistan, to Israel-Palestine, to Ethiopia-Eritrea, to Cyprus-Turkey, the list goes on).",1328543782

This notion that we're unaware of our addictions, that ""denial is the first mistake"" is all bullshit.  People are particularly rational (in their own respective idea of what rational is) when it comes to addictions.  It's just a cost benefit analysis.

This isn't a normal bar chart and there are some details that would be nice to know.<p>Such as: comments on hacker news are trees with the added property of having order within each level. So you can ""add"" trees together by overlapping the trees and calculating how many times a node occurs. Naturally, the top nodes will have always have higher percentages than the lower nodes within each level. The interesting part of it to me was comparing the trees produced for each user and the number and types of comments of people submitted.<p>The tooltips display information about the types of comments that occured at that position. The first piece of info is who commented most at that position for that particular user. So the first node is always by the main user. If you look at pg's tree, then you see that the top comments are basically pg talking to himself. We then see the chance that the node will occur at all. So with pg, there is a 64% chance that someone will reply to him at all. Then after that, there is a random comment displayed at the position to see the types of things might say at that point in the comment structure.<p>If I had to do it over, I would use the reddit API instead of crawling hacker news and regexping the data out of the html. I felt pretty guilty doing it and the data wasn't all that great.  Also, I was testing this mostly in chrome and just noticed that the tooltips break in an awful way with firefox. Poop.",1328542597

In terms of GSM, with which I am more familiar than CDMA, a mobile phone 'registers' with any GSM tower and passes along certain parameters. Using that information, the carrier can combined the input from one or more towers to triangulate the location of the phone.<p>The process is opt-in and used via control codes. For instance typing in <i>120</i>888*phone number# sends a request for the location of that number. If they have not agreed to be tracked, they are sent an SMS showing them the phone number of whoever sent the request and asking them if they want to be tracked. If they ignore the SMS, nothing further happens.<p>However, tower triangulation is inherently inaccurate and in general accuracies are only within about 100 m at best and valid for the past 10 minutes. It's definitely nothing close to the kind of accuracy that solutions which use GPS, such as Apple's Find My Phone, can give you.",1328541727

3557617,comment,3554719,3556604,2,0,rklancer,,,"With respect to video, I suspect that the answer is that video changes with time. If a video viewer's attention drifts off of the video, he or she is likely to notice being slightly behind when he or she does glance back at the video, and therefore promptly return to task. Whereas written material does nothing active to re-attract your attention.<p>I hypothesize that the attention-focusing effect of full-screen reading operates via a related mechanism. Online, there are many useful and/or time-wasting attention sinks just a click, or a glance across the screen, away. Normally this kind of task switching is so common you don't notice it, so it's very easy to fall into doing it when your attention drifts. Whereas when reading full-screen, task switching requires a certain amount of effort. Also the full-screened text is a big, juicy target for your attention. Therefore attention drifts are more likely to result in a return to the task at hand.<p>To return to mbpershan's great-grandparent post bashing Khan for bad pedagogy and in general dismissing people for not paying attention to the learning research literature, note that I work at a nonprofit that develops well-regarded modeling and simulation based learning activities in science, and we publish in this field. So, certainly I think learning research is important. But I imagine it would be tricky to find the positive effect of video, as outlined above, in ""official"" learning-science research.<p>The effect depends very much on the fact that <i>I sought out the video</i> and was motivated to learn the material, <i>and</i> on the fact that I have the freedom to procrastinate by freely exploring the web (including interesting material I have already saved for later reading), email, twitter, other work I have lined up, etc. (If you're thinking about 14-year old kids viewing Khan videos at home, substitute Youtube videos, games, and Facebook messages as needed.) But in the official literature, often you will find something like, a classroom of kids is given some mandatory curriculum content to study--which they may have no inherent interest in--and some are selected to read paper books while others are given video with a similar presentation of the material. They're pre-tested and then post-tested and the question is asked, ""were the learning gains of the video group statistically-significantly larger than those of the control (reading) group?""<p>Well, I wouldn't be terribly surprised to find no significant difference for the video group because the video students didn't really care that much (and were therefore happy to ""space out"" while the video went by, or were willing to make only nominal efforts to keep up) and because the control-group students weren't really being exposed to all the distractions of a teenager's bedroom which might tempt an otherwise-motivated student far off-task.<p>This is all speculation, and the whole made-up study design is obviously a straw man. So take what I say with a grain of salt. But nevertheless, learning-science results come from studies in very controlled contexts--which often have to do with <i>mass learning</i> of material the subjects don't choose--and often the result is remembered as a quick shorthand (""so-and-so showed that video doesn't work"") that may or may not apply to any specific situation (where the question may not be about the ""average"" student, where self-selection and motivation may play a critical factor, and where apparently rote learning may be acceptable because the students will contextualize and criticize in later months or years the material they just learned by rote.)",1328540785

Often times a founders shares will vest over time, so that if you quit in a month you don't retain an inappropriate amount of the company compared to the effort put in.

424625,comment,423768,423768,0,0,old-gregg,,,"We use some XUL for our project and I wanted to clarify something here.<p>First, there is XULRunner and then there is bare metal XUL. XULRunner is a bit bloated and somewhat slower. If you want to go faster, then start from scratch. Second, you can't compare XUL to Qt/GTK simply because XUL is interpreted, not compiled - write once and run everywhere, for real. This is a huge advantage.<p>Regarding execution speed: XUL is JavaScript and is getting all these latest performance improvements we've all heard about.<p>And finally, unlike AIR, XUL can call native code fairly easily, so nobody stops you from including Win32, GTK or Cocoa components inside of XUL containers. Moreover, you can host Flash (we do) inside of XUL if you need multi-platform animation, video and other stuff Flash is good for.<p>Two reasons, I think, XUL is somewhat obscure is because all desktop development hasn't been exactly a hot topic in tech media lately and due to somewhat steep learning curve since XUL is essentially a supercharged HTML+JavaScript for desktop.<p>We also researched other options:<p>GTK doesn't really live well outside of Linux: it's Mac version is only starting to take off and it has stability issues on Windows.<p>AIR has very limited integration options with native OS. Can't even call a DLL if you need to, thus it's not really a desktop platform, but rather ""Rich Web Platform"".<p>Qt is also an excellent choice if you have an expertise of building/packaging C++ on multiple platforms, we picked XUL because of the ease of Flash hosting. Qt didn't support Netscape-style plugins at the time.",1231400408

424598,comment,399863,399863,0,0,rakesh_d,,,"You seem to be overlooking the fact that most of the times the academic credentials of a candidate tend to be directly proportional to  his/her performance. In places like South Korea or India (my place), it is damn hard to find qualified people for the posts of professors even in 'Institutes of Excellence' like the IITs. There's an astronomical amount of gap between the amount of funding a normal university receives and the grants that IITs receive. It should be then very easy for a prospective employer to decide between a candidate from IIT and one from a normal university. The candidate from IIT most probably (99.99%) outperforms the other guy.<p>That's why admission to the IITs becomes the all-important thing not only for the students, but also to the parents whose only hope to get rich is through their wards. The offshoring / outsourcing phenomenon further catalyzes the sexiness of 'Brand IIT' as the students from IIT end up with offers from MNCs, which are far more lucrative than what the Indian Space Research Organization offers to its most senior scientist.<p>IITs get to chose their students from a vast pool of 500,000 students who cram day and night for more than 3 years during their high school. This further adds to their glamor. Hence it is not uncommon to find companies preferring a chemical engineering graduate from an IIT over a computer science graduate from other universities for the job of a programmer.<p>Thus third world citizens still live in the age where ""Credentials Do Matter"".",1231398823

So, you can't necessarily critique his evidence, but you can critique and discuss his rational.<p>Second, the article you posted is not a counter argument.

So, I guess I'll join in on the fun.<p>1. Facebook continues to loose money at a rate that makes the government (really any government) look good.  They quickly burn through their cash and raise more cash and then raise some more.  Their growth is phenomenal, but it becomes apparent that they aren't quite able to monetize.<p>2. Facebook tries a bold new strategy of invasive advertising.  Lots of analysis of all sorts of things that piss off users.<p>3. Alternative services create an interoperable system that doesn't suck.  Users are able to create friend relationships across domains.  All of a sudden, social-network lock-in crumbles.<p>I think that last one is the coolest thought.  There are things stopping an open network from working:<p>1. Logins.  OpenID is poorly implemented - it should work like email.  Put in your email address, get the format of the OpenID url by checking the domain part and then put the username together in the format specified by the site for login.  Profit!  Most banks already have a two screen authentication (first just username, then just password) so it's not so outrageous to think users won't accept that.<p>2. Friends.  There needs to be a cross-service friend system.  This isn't so hard to implement.  We already have a unique ID (the OpenID/Email).  So, now we can say, bill@microsoft.com is friends with steve@apple.com even if only steve has signed up for the service because we import the bill email address as an ID to the service when we sign-up/sync.  Now, that's a SPAM haven.  So, why not hash the first part.  So, bill becomes xc78901@microsoft.com as the ID and when bill@microsoft.com signs up, we hash it to see the ID and realise that he's already friends with others using the service.  Cool!  That way, we can take our friend network with us to whatever service and have it sync up easily.",1231398653

Agile is a methodology not a magic bullet,the constant iteration works great when you have a solid known backend tech (eg rails) and you are iterating for features and user experience. In this case your technology base is already stable so iterations come easy. 
When you are building a technology base from scratch at this scale however you better have a very well thought out  data and service model with tested prototypes or you are doomed.
Agile is great at keeping up work flow and communication,forcing reluctant devs to talk to business and forcing business to understand the cost of new features,but if you have architectural problems you wont have the luxury of those communication problems later!",1369648727

5774069,comment,5773267,5773924,3,0,tluyben2,,,"Well, the 'data' I have comes from friends from Bangalore, Jaipur and other cities who have(or had) their own outsourcing company. I know there is plenty of work and that it's growing (in both India and China btw). And I don't think outsourcing is or was scary. I made some nice companies based on it and made very good friends.<p>I'm happy to hear people are transforming themselves. What i'm referring to is the difference between 15 years ago and now ; the 'West' expects general higher quality from the outsourcing companies and that seems painful. Sure projects can 'succeed' as you say, but that says not much about quality. If something 'works' it can succeed short term and then fail later.<p>I have a lot of examples (even from the embedded world where it does get scary), but HP outsourced an internal product (in Java) to India. My colleagues at the time were asked to check the code coming back from India (and HP didn't outsource to small companies and didn't pay little either); not only did (and does) it not work, the code was almost completely unreadable.  One of my Pet Peeves being that a lot of Bachelor and Master of CS guys and girls in India have no idea what recursion is and so you see incredibly complex, huge methods in the code which try to solve a problem (directory traversal for instance) which can be solved in a few lines using recursion. An often used attack is to start with some while(true) and then stack up if statements and a number of variables to try to keep up where you are until you have 'enough depth'. And this not only once; the codebase is littered with it. Without sensible comments or method naming, it's very hard to figure out what the intent was.<p>Maybe this is rare instead of normal (I don't think so); i'm just saying that this is what other companies send us to 'make it work'. And this is what I have seen from my Indian friend's companies as well. Next to that my friends who are Indian and live there fulltime say this as well. They don't really see it as a problem generally because, like you say, projects succeed despite of it. Until they go out of business (and go work for a company big enough to not care (yet?) about this).<p>Are there any good sites showing off Indian software startups? Would be great to see that.",1369648633

Nobody is (or has ever been) seriously worried about that.  It would be as if saying the primary problem with hyperinflation is that you need to put too many zeros on your bank notes.  Imagine if someone asked about the feasibility of fiat currencies and the response was ""No, we've planned for that: There will be extra space on the end of the bank notes to print more zeros.""  Absurd!  Yet, that's the standard argument from bitcoin proponents when it comes to deflation (only in reverse).<p>The problem with bitcoin is that its designers believed that hyperinflation=bad necessarily implies that hyperdeflation=good.  If that were the case, then bitcoin would be the perfect currency.  Actually, both are fatal to an economy.  Economies basically shut down when currencies start to deflate.  It turns into a giant game of chicken:  Nobody wants to spend his currency first because he knows it will be worth more later.  First people delay luxury purchases, but before long you end up with a vicious circle and people wait until the very last second to purchase essentials like life-saving medicine.  There is a way to stop this, of course: Print more money (Hey, that's kinda like how the solution to hyperinflation is to <i>stop</i> printing more money! Who'da thunk it?).<p>>Nation States don't want this, as it restricts their expansion.<p>Or we can take off our tin-foil hats and admit that Bitcoin sucks and was designed by someone with little understanding of economics or the history of money.  In order to be a useful currency, the total number of bitcoins needs to track the size of the portion of the economy that uses bitcoins.  Bring me a cryptocurrency that was designed by someone who is more interested in making a solid, practical currency than rigidly following his ideology, then we can talk.  Nobody in power is in any way threatened by bitcoin.  It will implode by itself without any help from the outside (though I'm sure it will get some helpful nudges in that direction).<p>I'll close with this:  Part of engineering a good system is making prototypes and seeing what doesn't work.  Another part is looking at competing products and seeing where other engineers went wrong.  Blind, religious adherence to the principle of deflation is only going to cripple the adoption of alternate currencies.",1369646955

It's wrong, of course, because it's done from my armchair 50 years after the fact and with no firsthand knowledge of the region, but it's completely reasonable and does adequately satisfy the facts as we know them. Nine skiers set up camp in an area with potential avalanche danger, but no more or less danger than would have been found if they set up anywhere else they could have reached before nightfall. Sometime during the night, a loud noise, either from a nearby avalanche, a jet aircraft, or military ordnance, convinced at least five members of the group that an avalanche was bearing down on them. They burst out of the tent wearing whatever they happened to be sleeping in and ran. At some point one of them fell and struck his head on a rock. They became lost in the dark and poor visibility, or simply found themselves stranded with their injured friend, and finally built a fire. They quickly got hypothermia and probably shouted themselves hoarse for their friends. Two of them lost consciousness and the others made a desperation decision: To take what little clothes their two unconscious buddies had and risk it all to try and make it back to camp. One made it 300 meters, the second made it 480, and the third a full 630 meters before all five were dead from hypothermia. Back at camp, the four who didn't panic and run away in the night got dressed, collected provisions, and began to search for their friends. They searched for hours, circling high and low, until at some point either through a slip or just bad luck, they were caught in a real avalanche. During the resulting turmoil one received a fatal skull fracture, one received twelve broken ribs, and one bit her tongue off, all perfectly plausible injuries during such a traumatic death. Their bodies remained buried until the spring thaw, as is so common with avalanche victims. At the open-casket funeral for the first five victims, relatives saw the combination of five days of winter sunburn in those days before sunscreen, and the mortician's effort to cover up frostbite and a full month of exposure to the elements, and described it as a strange orange color; though others described it simply as a deep tan, which is consistent with reasonable expectations. And who knows what hair would have looked like after all that exposure and who knows what kind of treatment done by the mortician, so I can't assign too much significance to what amounts to a few anecdotal reports from some funeral attendees, and not even all funeral attendees. Plus I'm quite certain that if UFOs had turned all of their hair really gray, don't you think the cold war Russian authorities would have had it colored back to normal for an open casket funeral? Their bodies had been exposed outdoors for weeks. Of course they looked terrible.""</i>",1369646124

If you pick in a store, the picker might find things that are out of stock because walk-in customers have brought them. This means items missing or substituted, which customers don't like.<p>2. Most people have a way they do grocery shopping already (like driving to wal-mart) and you have to compete with that. People won't pay a big convenience fee. That means you need economies of scale, you need a low cost-per-pick and you need to drive down waste.<p>(People don't seem to factor the cost of their time or petrol into the cost of grocery shopping.

A very tenuously bound electron, with a very large n, can reach macroscopic size scales.

Then you know the regex engine itself is working.

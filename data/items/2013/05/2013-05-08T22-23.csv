How can that ever be purely expressed?<p>In this case you want ot have a system that reacts to an event that fires on a regular interval (as well as other sorts of input events). If you search for Functional Rdeactive Programming you will find some example libraries out there that try to do this in a pure manner (although I would personally have to say that this is all still a bit on the experimental side of things).<p>That said, Haskell still lets you do things the imperative way if you want! All you need to do is put the impure code in the IO monad, where it belongs.<p>You are only forced to be purely functional if you want to or if whoever is calling you must be a pure function. So basically, the idea is that your `main` function is impure code in the IO monad and it can call either more impure code or pure ""helper"" functions. Increasing the percentage of your code that is pure is a nice thing but its not mandatory.",1368053908

For people threatened with that violence (which can be even more dire and hard than a few slaps or kicks), it's common to be forced to accept unfavourable and backwards working conditions, just because their job is a ""buyer's market"". Child labor is a blatant case of this, but most sweatshop jobs in the third world also are.<p>As western countries we have set up our standards higher (than, say, Dicken's London, or J.D Rockfeller's miners, paid in company scrip) , we should demand that they are held higher in the third world too, instead of lowering ours to compete with them.",1368053693

5677563,comment,5677126,5677326,20,0,count,,,"Here's the gist, in simplified terms.  I assume you understand what stock and stock brokers are...<p>You can 'short' a stock that you think is going to lose value (e.g. you expect a major earnings miss to be reported).<p>Shorting a stock means you borrow a share from (generally) your broker at todays price. You then sell that share to someone else for market price.  At a determined date, you have to buy another share at market rate and give it back to your broker (this is called 'covering' your short).<p>If you bet right, you borrowed a share, and sold it for $N.  Then, at a future date, when the price fell, you bought for $N-X, and gave the share back to your broker.  You just made $X, the price difference from the value of the stock falling.<p>If you bet incorrectly, you borrowed a share, and sold it for $N.  Then, at the future date, the price is actually higher, and you have to buy a share at $N+X, AND give the share back to your broker.  You just lost $X, the price difference from the value of the stock rising.<p>If you bet REALLY wrong, the $+X factor can get really high - your broker may 'call' and force you to give them cash, pending your future purchase of the share to return (your 'cover').<p>Now, to MOST people, shares are effectively unlimited - with tens of millions or more shares on the market for most traded firms, liquidity isn't an issue.  If you want a share or a few shares in a company, it's pretty easy to get them.
What may or may not be happening here, is that a TON of folks are currently 'short' on Tesla's stock, meaning millions of folks are going to HAVE to buy shares of the stock to 'return to their broker' and cover their short.  The problem is that Tesla DIDNT go down.<p>Normally, lots of folks are short on lots of stocks, and the market just moves.  Occasionally, you get a confluence of events which leads to there being a high demand for a stock that a large number of shares are shorted on, which has a self-feeding pain cycle:
the stock price is based mostly on demand and liquidity - as more and more folks HAVE to buy the shares to cover their shorts, the demand for the stock is going to go up, and thus the price is going to go up as well.  This increase in price increases the pain, and triggers many brokers to 'call' those margins, requiring MORE people to buy the stock to cover, driving the demand up even higher.  The end result is a big spike in the price of the stock, and a TON of people losing money on their bad bets.",1368053416

Further, there's nothing you can do to <i>make</i> your brother do this practice.<p>The thing about well-guided mushroom and Ayahuasca experiences is such that you learn what it is like to <i>not</i> be sensitive to arising stimuli, and as such, seek out practices like this.

I like how you have the ""as a"" part of it, so rather than someone saying ""I want this"", they say ""as a X, I want this"".  I think it prompts people to be more concise and clear about what they want.<p>But there are some obvious things to address...
- how to deal with malicious/unserious users
- how to organize the information in such a way that it's easy for entrepreneurs and ""makers"" to navigate to problems they'd like to solve
- make it easy for people to use this on the spur of the moment.  people are best at telling you what they want on the spur of the moment, rather than having them think back to what there problems were<p>Some ideas...
- maybe you could do some type of language processing to keep track of how many times someone said ""I want X"".  (you can't literally match the characters because there are multiple ways of saying ""I want X"")
- making it easy to use on the spur of the moment probably means making a good mobile version of this.  (I don't have a smartphone, so I don't know if you did already)
- I'm not sure how this would be done, but I've always had the idea of having some sort of browser add-on where you have a keyboard shortcut for an ""idea bar"", so you could just press cmd+i, type in  your idea/problem, and it'd be sent to a database/site like aswhoiwant.com.  you could also keep track of things like what site the idea is coming from, maybe some stuff about the user etc.  this might lead to more serious use.
EDIT: I like what _lex1 said about spam
- I've thought about it a little, and to reduce spam and increase seriousness, you'd probably have to make it less convenient.  maybe don't show people the streaming list of posts.  but it'd be good to show people a list of their posts along with how many upvotes they got.  maybe there should be a list of posts that you could upvote, updated every hour or so.  maybe one list for popular posts(with most upvotes for day/month/year), and another for new ones.",1368052925

They are literally owned by no one, and barring some event where you crash something into the Earth, nothing you do on them will ever effect the livability of our planet. You really can go there and do whatever you want, on whatever scale you want.<p>Economically asteroid mining makes more sense, but if we acknowledge that scientific research is important then the old truism of our off-world rovers is still - afaik - full in force: impressive as they are, they take weeks to accomplish what a geologist with a shovel could do in an hour.",1368052788

As top commenter bjhoops says: ""it is probably much more common that some kinds of mentally ill individuals happen to be anti-authoritarian.""<p>And I don't really agree with it either, but Einstein has often been co-opted by Asperger's support groups as one of their own.<p>From my admittedly limited reading on autism, Asperger's, and other behavioral diagnoses, they are not mental illnesses but rather alternate ""wirings"" of the brain. People on this spectrum can (to varying degrees) learn to deal with the ""neuro-typical"" world around them, but they can't change their brains. And these are not one-dimensional conditions: people on the spectrum have any number of different wiring, from social handicaps to language problems, hypersensitivity to touch or noise, face recogniition, etc.<p>I suspect that anti-authoritarianism is one of these dimensions. It can exist on it's own in an otherwise ""neuro-typical"" person, but it often gets added to other deficiencies on the Autism-Asperger's spectrum.<p>I am not saying that blind adherence to authority is ""typical,"" but I think there is often a recognition of parental and social authority that is mostly normal which is what the anti-authoritarian lacks.",1368052380

That is out of 72 million shares on the market (""float"").  At an average volume of 3 million shares traded per day (trailing 3 month average) it would take more that 10 trading days of nothing but short sellers buying shares on the open market to return to the people they borrowed them from (""cover"").<p>Short trading unhedged is regarded as dangerous for this reason.  If you buy a stock in the traditional way, if it goes to zero you only lose your investment.  If you sell a share short, your losses (amount you have to re-buy it for minus the price you sold it for) is unbounded.  Typically, this isn't collateralized by cash, but in money that brokers loan to traders (""margin"").  If a broker sees that I have a really, really big loss on a short position, they might make me repay that money (""issue a margin call"")... and depending on the situation, that might force a trader to cover their short position.<p>Anyway, point is that this can lead to a bunch of short sellers driving up the price of a heavily short stock all at once because they've either decided to cut their losses or because of margin calls, called a ""short squeeze"".

One of the big factors in economic recovery is morale - if people don't have faith in their country, government, or monetary system; how can you expect them to be productive members of society?<p>If you were to ask any person what they thought US's most notable achievement was - it's not unlikely they'll mention the moon landing. The moon landing was such a milestone, such a landmark achievement - it sent nationalism through the roof. That kind of pride and fervor would be extremely over the next few years, not only in economic recovery, but in growth and expansion of tech related fields.<p>All it would take is one very good speech I think, to inspire the nation and light the fire under US's latent tech reserves. Something kinda like Reagan's speeches - which felt like pep talks more than presidential speeches, linking the economic, political, and cultural muscle of America's yesterday to the moon landing. There's a lot of people out there who feel like America's golden days have passed, so I don't think it would be horribly difficult to link those prosperous times with the moon landing. At the end they could sign off with something like what Aldrin mentioned in his article; I believe this nation should commit itself, within two decades, to commencing American permanence on the planet Mars.<p>The only difference between Kennedy's speech and the Mars speech would be that Kennedy's was used to win the cold war, and the mars speech would be used to fix internal economic strife.",1368050960

Most people do things that arise the interest of private industry. See, e.g., the credit ratings agency mafia. Those companies would have a field day if they had access to Facebook's information. See also, all the hiring managers that would have to have access to peoples' social networking information in order to blacklist them for jobs. Or insurance companies looking for any reason to drop people from healthcare plans, etc.<p>How much you worry about something is generally proportional to the product of how likely that something is to happen and how bad that thing would be if it did happen. It's exceedingly unlikely that you'll be at the receiving end of a federal prosecution, even if that would be a really bad thing. But having trouble with your credit, having trouble getting a job, being dropped from your health insurance--all of these things are much more likely, and they can be pretty bad in and of themselves. Yeah, sure, the government can bankrupt me defending a prosecution, but then again so can my HMO dropping me from my health plan if I get sick.<p>As I said, I imagine this is a matter of outlook. I don't see myself as a revolutionary who might get railroaded by the government for fighting for a just cause. I do see myself as a guy with a wife and a kid looking to buy a house some day, worrying about health care costs for my aging parents, etc. Given that, the ways private industry can screw me over are a lot more real to me.",1368050621

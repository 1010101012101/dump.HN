I&#x27;ve had teams with that many direct reports, and it <i>sucks</i> for me and it sucks for the people reporting to me if there&#x27;s not then a team lead or similar exactly because it drains time. I don&#x27;t see cutting the time I spend on people as viable at all.<p>The threshold might very well differ from person to person, but in my opinion, if you can&#x27;t afford to schedule 30 minutes per person on a weekly basis (whether or not you actually end up using the full amount of time) without feeling it is too much, then you can&#x27;t afford to manage that many people directly, no matter how many people we&#x27;re talking. For some that might mean 10 or even more works, but in my experience as the team size grows the amount of time you need to invest per person grows as well as interpersonal issues and communications gets more complicated.<p>> Very cute.<p>Maybe, but it&#x27;s not meant to be - I&#x27;m very serious on that point.

But in my experience at least, there&#x27;s a big difference in what comes out when you bring someone into a meeting room for 5 minutes (or on a private call), and specifically <i>ask them</i> in a one on one setting if there&#x27;s anything they&#x27;d like to bring up, anything I could help with, what personal development they&#x27;d like doing etc..<p>I&#x27;m sure that for some people that&#x27;s not necessary and they get people to open up without creating that setting all the time, but my experience with my own managers too is that managers in IT (probably applies elsewhere too, but I&#x27;ve only ever worked in tech companies) are notoriously bad at creating good environments for this.

That&#x27;s a problem, as consumer drones aren&#x27;t designed to spend weeks sitting outdoors. Even if a drone was weatherproof, it would need its batteries topped-up from time to time.<p>Second, you will not have access to your phone or other signaling devices if you are getting busted. It would be very hard to trigger the drone surreptitiously.<p>Last, police are going to notice a drone flying away during a bust. And they won&#x27;t be happy about it. For all they know, the drone could be carrying a bomb. This escalates the situation and makes a bad outcome much more likely.<p>If you want a better use of drones, here&#x27;s one: First response. Place drone &quot;nests&quot; every 500 meters in urban areas. Cell towers might be convenient locations. When ShotSpotter[1] detects gunfire, dispatch the closest drone to the scene. It can arrive within 20 seconds, record footage, and relay it to police. Currently, police and medics wait for backup before going to the scene of a shooting. But with drones to send the all-clear, they could treat victims sooner, saving lives.<p>Future upgrades could even allow tracking of suspects. This would make it much harder to get away with firing a gun in a city.<p>1. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunfire_locator"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunfire_locator</a>",1434882666

He had a huge warehouse, where people would stand in one place and literally pick clothes out of one basket and then sort them into several smaller ones, by colour or type. The atmosphere in the warehouse wasn&#x27;t exactly perfect,but employees could talk to each other and they had a radio playing music. Based on some observations, he introduced a complete ban on casual talking and he took away the radio. Sure, for the employees it must have been much worse. But the productivity increased by 50% - an average amount sorted per day per employee was 400kg, after the change it went up to 600kg, which in the scale of things made a HUGE difference at the end of the month. The company could process a lot more with the same number of people. And yes, sure - people would get unhappy and leave, but it being rather easy manual labour - there were always 50 other people willing to take the position.
I&#x27;m not defending my father, I think the way he ran the company was horrible for the employees, but it&#x27;s just the personal anecdote showing that working in a nice/friendly environment doesn&#x27;t necessarily make you more efficient.

They realized that no one sitting in an ivory tower or behind a desk should be able to rubber-stamp someone else&#x27;s life out of existence.

The confusion of regex to me is not from the string representation, it is that some characters are &quot;special&quot; while others are &quot;normal&quot; (including whitespace). At first it appears that most characters are &quot;normal&quot; and so you can start from some example and generalize the string until it matches all the things you want - but once you start putting parenthesis and such in you start to realize that most of the string wont be matched &quot;normally&quot; and it is better to start thinking like a grammar and write it from scratch. This double thinking is pretty annoying.<p>For this reason, to me the Lua patterns are really the only alternative I&#x27;ve come across to regex that I&#x27;ve liked.

Especially for uploads, so that I could upload a file in the browser at, say, 50kB/s.<p>There&#x27;s an old Firefox extension called &quot;Firefox Throttle&quot; that does this, but it only works with Firefox 3.6 (which is obsolete and doesn&#x27;t work with many new sites).<p>I&#x27;m not a programmer, so excuse my ignorance, but in case something like this is easy to make, I&#x27;d be grateful and I know a few other people would appreciate it as well.
I don&#x27;t need a GUI, a setting in about:config would work just fine.<p>(Oh and I know there are some other solutions, but it needs to be a browser extension.)",1434880954

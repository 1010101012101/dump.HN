That&#x27;s why I called it brainwashing because c, c++, javascript, php, java, python,... most of the top 10 languages use 0-based indexing and most likely we would all be comfortable if they had all taken the path of being 1-based.<p>It&#x27;s sort of like driving on the left or on the right.

The distance between the commissars and elected officials is much bigger.<p>They&#x27;re appointed by vote by foreign ministers of the member states (as a group, they can&#x27;t include or exclude individuals), who are elected as a group (again, no apointing individuals) by the local parliaments.

7194995,comment,7193937,7194765,5,0,smsm42,,,"The current debate is exactly about the question if the basic human rights are violated or not. As soon as this would be resolved - I mean legally, having an opinion on that is not enough, for enforcement you need laws - if it would be resolved that some laws violate the basic human rights of LGBT people it would provide the basis for making them void.<p>So far the court only decided that the federal laws <i>banning</i> same-sex marriage are violating the rights of the citizens. They did not decide that recognizing same-sex marriage is a basic human right though, and since the text of the Constitution is also mum on this question, it would require a separate court decision to have federal enforcement of such rights, if recognized.<p>However not having such decision is in no way comparable with limitations of freedom of expression instituted in Russia. It&#x27;s one thing to complain that the federal government does not force states to recognize same-sex marriage, especially if it doesn&#x27;t even have a legal basis to do so right now, and another thing is to prosecute people for opening support centers for gay youth or for debating the topic of sexual relationships and freedoms in public.",1391752201

My high score is 104 if that&#x27;s any indicator of how much I like it.<p>Before Flappy Bird I was pretty into Clash of Clans and another similar build-and-wait-and-repeat game.  I realized that there is no true progress in those games, and all you have to do to &quot;win&quot; is play more than the other guy.<p>Flappy Bird is exactly the opposite of Clash of Clans.  Clash is all about incremental progress - do One More Thing and you&#x27;ll get 1% more resources to do That Other One More Thing.  Over and over.  You inch towards a goal that&#x27;s not there.<p>In Flappy Bird, you can&#x27;t make progress.  Every time you click start it might as well be the first time you opened the app.  No power ups, no In App Purchases, no levels, just you and those pipes.  I get 50 and 5 equally often.    Something in my brain rebelled when I played Flappy Bird and made me delete Clash and my other slow-build games.  I just want to play something that&#x27;s over quickly, highly interactive, and uses actual skill.<p>I&#x27;m sure after a few weeks of Flapping i&#x27;ll be as sick of it as I was of Clash, but I think it&#x27;s worth nothing that FB is the exact opposite of all of the most popular games out there right now and I think that hits a subconscious note with some people like me.",1391752197

Each time they provide a feedback for an other submission, they get to view a feedback provided on theirs (hence the loop).<p>You can fine tune the system by having feedback receivers rate the feedback they've recieved (better feedback = more points for the person who wrote it = they get to see more feedback on their post or their post gets pushed to top).<p>I think it's a beautiful and self-enforced ""you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours"" idea.<p>2) Graffiti:  This is a bookmarklet that allows a user to draw on top of a webpage (probably requires transparent flash).  Of course, they can view other people's graffitis as well.<p>This would be pretty awesome, and has a lot of game aspects to it that would make it extremely addictive.  For example, you could notify a user if anybody writes over their graffiti (eg, starting turf wars), and you could keep a record board for ""most pages graffiti'd"" and ""most area covered"", etc.<p>I feel like there's a very real possibility this could go viral and stay popular.

1683306,comment,1682125,1682422,0,0,chmike,,,"This was more then 20 years ago (this hurts). There are many ways one could imagine to change these rules today in the way the killing is performed. Since most people have today phones with numeric camera capture devices, killing could be changed into taking a picture of the target in a particular condition. For instance one variant could be called paparazzi where the hitman is a team of two players of opposite sex randomly combined that will have to cooperate. The killing could be taking a picture of a stolen kiss on the cheek or a photo bombing which could become a parallel contest. Replace the umbrella by a big colorful hat or anything alike which attracts attention and is funny. Those games should of course always respect the law, culture and rules of the place and require explicit (signed) prior consent of the players. The target should then be implicitly given ownership of the photo by game rules and be able to decide of their use. People should never be/feel constrained to play the game.<p>So the first fundamental rule of such type of real life games should be respect of the players and social context.<p>In the virtual worlds (i.e. WoW) one can erase the avatar and create a new one from scratch. In real life this is not possible, and interferences with other activities (family, study and professional) may become devastating by accident or youth naivety. Organizers should take their responsibility very seriously. Otherwise the limit is just imagination. The first aim of such type of game is to be fun and provide good laughs and catalyze social contacts.<p>In some contexts where ostensible extravagant behavior is not tolerated, i.e. army, business, the game could be changed into assigning a random secret (i.e. word) to each player with the hitman playing then as a spy that has to find out that secret by any means (except water boarding of course, although...). This could be a good game to entertain people and be useful by training their vigilance to what they say and where, etc.<p>The business idea could then be to provide a web service to manage the game, assign random secrets (i.e. word, object, concept) and a mean for the spy to check his finding with eventually a limited number of tests. This type of game could help socialize but also contribute to train people to hold defense/trade secrets.<p>Have fun...",1284280148

There are differences between the BASICs of the 80s and (say) the bash scripts of today, but they're not as big as surface syntax would initially seem to suggest. BASIC back then taught one thing well, unstructured imperative code, well enough that a BASIC programmer, believe it or not, wouldn't have felt it too big a jump to move straight to assembler programming, which would have been the next logical progression to eke out decent performance on the severely resource-constrained microcomputers of the day.<p>The biggest difference between programming then and now is the size of our problems, and consequently, the number of abstraction tools in our languages. But there is a relatively small set of abstractions known to work well, and a substantial subset of them crop up in almost all languages.

Some will just create an app that a dedicated developer will have to fix at some point. Some will find that it's easy to get into but very hard to master, and just give up.<p>However, getting into it will be priceless. You'll hopefully develop more of an insight into how tough a given problem is, or isn't. Developers will be less able to BS you (e.g. ""we should just rewrite it from scratch""). It'll reduce your risks and help you to interview developers. Hey, and you're young so you definitely have time to learn any skill you want, given enough effort. At 50, more likely a waste of your time. In your 20's (my assumption from your pic) - why not. Good luck.<p>Btw, I'm a long-time developer that has a post-grad business degree and keeps my foot firmly in both camps! Keeping up with the technical aspects takes up a lot of time, especially if I want to build something useful in a given area.",1284279264

Even if he gets someone else to write his app, he'll still be able to follow the code if he knows the language a bit.  Who knows, maybe he'll like java and writing code that he'll become a coder who like business. There are too many languages out there, my philosophy is to pick one and get working. There are too many people who will pick faults in anything and everything you pick. Hard part is making a decision...now the next hard part is following thru with your commitment. I'm picking up Java right now, I find the Dietel Java: How to program 7e pretty good text. Very wordy, but that means it explains the concepts very well.

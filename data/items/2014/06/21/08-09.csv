7924519,comment,7923535,7924469,2,0,_delirium,,,"I meant average, yeah, not necessarily that you work the <i>same</i> hours every week. However countries also vary a bit in how normal it is for people to work outside of a standard daytime, M-F workweek.<p>I think even in the U.S., it&#x27;s only really in the Valley (and maybe also in NYC finance) where a <i>regular</i> salaried job has wild week-to-week variations in working hours. Occasional variations, yes, but in most industries it&#x27;s expected that you&#x27;ll work standard hours most of the time (e.g. 8-5, M-F), deviating only when there is some major issue. Every engineering company I&#x27;ve heard of works like that, for example. The main exception is that people do do quite a bit of email outside of work hours.<p>There are all sorts of practicalities that rely on a predictable work schedule: scheduling your carpool, arranging childcare dropoff/pickup, etc. How does that work in the tech industry? Do people at Google not have carpools, kids, etc.?",1403341069

7924513,comment,7924282,7924379,6,0,battani,,,"&quot;Second, because convert-transmit-unconvert still bypasses many of the painful aspects of other money transfer mechanisms.&quot;<p>Using a credit card online or 1-click checkout isn&#x27;t painful.<p>&quot;Both buyer and seller only interact with entities they trust (coinbase and their bank)&quot;<p>Pretty sure most people trust the bank that issued their credit card.<p>&quot;no credit cards (and associated fees, chargebacks, and headaches)&quot;<p>No chargebacks may be good for merchants, but not for consumers (no protection). Most of the CC fees are reimbursed to the customer in the form of rewards. In France for example, usual debit card fees are 0.5%, and credit cards with rewards are 2%-4%. In Australia, the government intervened and all card fees are < 0.5%. This was good for merchants but customers now don&#x27;t get rewards/cashback/points on their card.<p>&quot;the transmission process in the middle uses bitcoin in lieu of ACH or similar (avoiding many potential risks, reversals, and the various Bad Things that can usually happen if you pay directly from a bank account)&quot;<p>Not sure what those &quot;many bad things&quot; are. I recently received subpar merchandise from a merchant; called my bank that morning, the transaction was reversed, almost no questions asked. There was a follow-up &quot;investigation&quot; that was in my favor. The fact that I can reverse transactions gives me peace of mind, otherwise known as consumer protection.<p>It&#x27;s just seeming more and more to me that companies in the bitcoin merchant space are trying to find infinitesimally small optimizations they want to address in the current credit card system using bitcoin. It seems that they&#x27;re trying to find (or sometimes create) a problem to fit bitcoin, instead of using bitcoin to solve an already existing problem.<p>I think they&#x27;ll slowly find out, as Coinbase may be with this new feature, that bitcoin is actually not a good currency to be used directly, but rather as an efficient value transfer mechanism, under the hood. In other words, that the real value is in the blockchain, not in bitcoin itself. But I may be wrong.<p>In any case, I&#x27;m sticking to my credit card (and soon, tap-tap mobile wallet). Bitcoin doesn&#x27;t really solve a problem for consumers in consumer-to-merchant transactions; mainly because, well, there really isn&#x27;t a problem to solve to begin with.",1403340685

Since the names are so similar, did you get inspiration from Runit? And if so, what would be the main differences/advantages besides being portable to more platforms (Windows I presume)?<p>@chubot mentions the thread-per-process overhead. Runit does process-per-process so in that aspect Runsit should be a bit lighter. Then again, Runit is extremely tiny, its statically compiled binaries taking up next to nothing. The wait(-1) trick sounds good, but there must be a reason why for example Runit doesn&#x27;t use it, since afaik Runit only runs on POSIX systems.<p>Keep up the good work!<p>EDIT: a web interface, that&#x27;s pretty spiffy!

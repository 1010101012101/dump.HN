I&#x27;m not sure what it is exactly the author is trying to express here: that engineers need to stay current on new, hot technologies?  Everyone knows that.  But then he seems to deride people who, based on his interviewing, haven&#x27;t used a <new technology X> in production / in a new project.<p>You can&#x27;t have it both ways.  You need to find a way to evaluate people and, through that evaluation, grok whether or not they can pick up a new technology that they aren&#x27;t already familiar with.  If you can&#x27;t figure that out, your interview process has failed.  Think about it: the complexity and difficulty of your own problems vastly exceed the difficulty a senior engineer faces learning a few new frameworks or APIs.  If not, you&#x27;re doing something pretty trivial.<p>The best people I&#x27;ve ever worked with weren&#x27;t people who a priori understood the technology stack we were working with -- instead, they have been seasoned engineers who know how go out and learn, and then apply what they already know in a new environment.  This seems so obvious I feel silly even writing it down here, but this is on the front page, so it must be resonating with folks.<p>What tptacek has said about .NET developers working at IT departments at huge organizations really rings true here.

It always freaks me out on cold days, wet days when I can see my breath inside!  We live in Shizuoka prefecture in Japan, which has a mild climate in the winter.  It very rarely snows (once every couple of years) and it usually doesn&#x27;t even freeze over night.  In the winter, the day time high can be below 10 degrees C, but is almost never below 5.  Most days it hovers around 10 degrees +- 3.  The low is normally below 5 but only gets below freezing a few nights of the year.<p>We have a south eastern exposure and big glass sliding doors which capture a lot of light.  It almost never rains in the winter in Shizuoka (only a few times a month), so this is the main form of heating that we use.  At noon, it is probably 15 degrees C on sunny days.  Unfortunately my office is on the north side, which is much colder.  On cold, sunny days I will take my laptop to the warm area of the house and work there.  Because I do work for a UK firm, I do work a lot at night, so I often work with an ambient temperature of 10 degrees or colder.<p>The main problem I have at the moment is that my hands get cold.  In the last similar story someone linked to a keyboard that works as a heater and I think I will try something like that next winter (it is already spring here, so it is getting warmer -- next week is supposed to be 18-19 degrees).<p>When the heat comes, perhaps I will give some advice on how to stay cool without air conditioning ;-)",1426337423

9202428,comment,9202186,9202364,0,0,lucaspiller,,,"> subsequent interactions should be much faster, since all rendering is happening on the client, and the server is only delivering API interaction<p>It depends on what you are actually doing and how much you cache client side, but for most cases that isn&#x27;t going to make things faster for the end user.<p>Take the example of a theoretical blog post that takes 10ms to get from the database and 50ms to render on the server. You could potentially save server capacity by shifting that 50ms of rendering* from the server to client, but in actual fact the client (a low powered mobile device) probably renders it slower than the server.<p>The main thing though is this doesn&#x27;t take into account the 2500ms round trip time it takes the mobile device to make a HTTP request. This is going to be the same whether you render on the client or server.<p>Now I agree it makes sense in some cases, if you cache the data on the client (ie an email client could cache the 100 most recent emails) then it will be faster, but the most services that use client side rendering aren&#x27;t doing this, so there is no real benefit to the end user.<p>(Apologies if I&#x27;m just repeating the article, but it&#x27;s down for me)<p>*Serialising into whatever format you API uses is still rendering, so you aren&#x27;t actually saving 50ms.",1426337202

RMS absolutely uses cellphones. He just doesn&#x27;t own one himself. Instead, he borrows the phones of the people around him, and his assistant collects those people&#x27;s phone numbers in order to call him.<p>What this says about his philosophy probably depends significantly on how irritating you find it.<p>That said, it&#x27;s worth noting that it&#x27;s certainly not that he doesn&#x27;t care about the privacy of others.

As long as developers keep accepting that they have to spend 15 hours a month on their own dime just to keep up, it&#x27;s outright exploitative. Developers are generally expected to keep current in the breakneck technology rat race with no support from their employing organization. This <i>could</i> (maybe) be considered reasonable if technology moved more slowly, but not the way the world of computer software works.<p>It&#x27;s one thing if you&#x27;re a consultant in a web development position where your team is constantly jumping from the previous best practice to the next; keeping up in such an environment is easy and you&#x27;ll get paid to do it. The problem occurs if you&#x27;re in (e.g.) a back-end position where your job duties require you to focus on slower-moving technologies that might have lesser demand in the market. What happens if you lose your job after 5 years? Unless you spent all your weekends working with the latest hot frameworks, you&#x27;re (mostly) screwed.<p>There was a good essay a while ago which stated that software developers need a professional association. If we were organized, we could put forward the very reasonable demand that a small portion of our on-the-clock time should be spent for education. I think this is a requirement if we are not aiming for a world of 40-year old burnouts and early retirees.",1426334450

This code reinvents so many wheels for the 1000th time in C code history, it&#x27;s just tiresome to read.

4650259,comment,4648946,4648946,3,0,vidarh,,,"I'm confused. Some <i>are</i> already charging fees to carry international traffic. Or rather, they do it indirectly, by offering packages that offer access only to their peering relationships at specific interchanges or full transit.<p>E.g. at work we have a customer that has 95%+ UK traffic, and one operator offered us bandwidth at about 20% our current price for a peering package that included access to pretty much all UK and most larger European ISP's, but no transit, that we could mix and match with a smaller amount of full transit. If our bandwidth needs had been larger, we'd have looked seriously into it, but as it stands, our customers UK only traffic is low enough that the cost difference isn't worth the hassle of managing our own BGP routing and an extra port.<p>In other words, it sounds like what these operators really want is to make this mandatory in some form, so that they won't have to deal with those pesky competitors that might undercut them and offer prices actually based on what it costs to provide the service. Many of them will also see it as a way to prevent relative strength in negotiations from deciding on peering costs.<p>It also means that today, when buying full transit, you _are_ paying a substantial premium for the costs your provider incurs in procuring substantial capacity for international traffic. Almost nobody forgoes paying the premium today because almost everyone _does_ have substantial international traffic, and pretty much nobody can afford not doing so. You can bet your provider does everything they can to peer with everyone who can lower their transit bill, but all but the very largest will still end up paying for transit for a fairly substantial percentage of their traffic, and that cost is of course passed on to their customers.<p>I ran an ISP in the mid 90's in Norway. At the time, we had ""massive"" international bandwidth, because we bought 512kbps full transit via Sweden. For that privilege we paid about twice what it would cost us to get a 10Mbps port at the switch at NIX (the then only Norwegian interchange) and suitable line capacity to our office. Our nearest competitor in terms of price and size had 128kbps full transit + 1Mbps to NIX (it was a mixed bag: our customers were ecstatic about the speed of international downloads - personally I remember waiting up to download the newest version of Netscape a few days after we'd upgraded from 256kbps, and had the line almost exclusively to myself and found it absolutely amazing to download at a speed I'd find shockingly slow on my home connection today...  But they were annoyed at the performance for Norwegian sites, especially latency - see below).<p>The only reason we didn't connect immediately is that at that point, to be able to connect you needed at least one peering agreement in place first, which required you to first demonstrate a reasonable amount of traffic.<p>But it demonstrates the cost differences this industry operates with: If you could fill that 10Mbps with traffic via peering arrangements, your bandwidth cost would still be only twice what someone would pay for 512kbps full transit. Even worse: Those 512kbps of pure transit at the time did _not_ guarantee your provider had peering at NIX (ours didn't for the first year or two), and so you might find massive lag as your traffic went via D-GIX in Stockholm and back to Norway...<p>I don't know current relative prices, since I've not been directly in that market since '99, but I do know the gaps are still massive and there's probably still also money to be made in arbitrage in some locations in offering custom ""bandwidth mixes"" for someone who can do a good job of negotiating the right contracts given the 5-times difference I mentioned I was offered. Even more so because of a proliferation of peering points.<p>Effectively this is what companies that are large enough to do their own peering gets - but it is far harder to make it pay for itself if you're ""only"" buying in the <200-300Mbps range or so (guesstimate). We ""only"" do an aggregate of 45Mbps at the moment), and bandwidth makes up less of our operating costs than the personnel cost to my employer of the time I'd have to spend configuring and managing a BGP setup and peering arrangements alone, much less equipment and interconnect fees.",1350176203

4650249,comment,4648189,4650081,2,0,psb217,,,"Err, Einstein's static universe did not preclude the death of stars via exhaustion of their fuel. So, the entire universe would ""heat up"" to a uniform distribution (i.e. evolve according to the heat equation), with the future local heat being everywhere equal to the mean local heat at present. And, in general, the universe is overwhelmingly empty and cold.<p>I'm not sure what the mean energy of the universe is, or what the minimal energy required to coax an electron to jump around and create visible light is, but it could well be that the values are such that an entire universe homogeneously set to the mean local energy of our current universe would be nowhere energetic enough to cause the birth of (naked-human-eye-visible) photons. (note: it would also be important to know the relative amounts of energy dedicated to mass and motion)<p>In other words, given a perhaps dubious mixing of temporally diverse understandings of physics, the relevant homogeneously energetic universe would likely be nowhere energetic enough to cause light.

One recent session was intended to figure out why people like playing word games, a genre Gage has always hated. (He thinks its cheating to build a game on top of a system that already exists, like words or numbers.)<p>So he spent two weeks playing Bookworm, Words With Friends and Wurdle, during which he decided that the genre suffered from a serious lack of strategy  aside from Scrabble, he says, most of those games are just dressed-up word searches.<p>The result of this was SpellTower, Gages newest and most successful game, which allows users to create towers by building words from letters in adjacent boxes.

In fact, the C++ compilers for a number of supercomputers have functional language extensions but I have almost never seen those extensions used because they do not solve any of the problems parallel systems designers have.<p>To dispel one misconception, the reason it is simple to write massively parallel code in C++ is that the basic model is a single process locked to a single core with no context switching at all. It is all non-blocking, coroutine-esque, cooperative scheduling. Writing this type of code is exactly like old school single-process, interrupt-driven UNIX code from back in the day when no one did threading. Simple to write, simple to analyze. Analogues of this work well even on fine-grained systems.<p>The real parallelization challenge is often completely overlooked by people offering nominal solutions. While your application may only be composed of two algorithms <i>and</i> those algorithms are independently massively parallel, that does not imply that the algorithms are operating on identical representations of the underlying data model, something that is tacitly assumed most times. Representation transforms between algorithm steps inherently parallelize poorly.<p>A canonical example of this is the hash join algorithm. It is a two-stage algorithm, and both stages are obviously parallelizable, yet ad hoc hash joins parallelize very poorly in practice because it requires a representation transform.<p>In a sense, the real parallelism problem is a data structure problem. How do you design a single data structure such that all operators required for your algorithms and data models are both efficient and massively parallel? Using functional programming languages does not speak to that and it is the fundamental challenge regardless of the hardware.",1350173723

Then someone comes along and tells you they're going to give you 20 points for every book you read, and when you get 200 points you get a pizza party. What happens is that for a few days or weeks you'll read more books, but after that you'll completely lose interest in reading and likely won't read any more books for years, so in total you'll read much fewer books than if you had never been offered the extrinsic rewards. We see this in all areas of life, e.g. studies show that people who are paid to lose weight end up gaining weight, and people who are paid to drive safer are more likely to die in car crashes. So when you see literally dozens of startups offering prizes to kids for exercising or brushing their teeth, it's highly probletic to say the least.<p>The original book on this is Alfie Kohn's Punished by Rewards: The Trouble with Gold Stars, Incentive Plans, A's, Praise, and Other Bribes. Pretty much the most important book for any entrepreneur to read. Daniel Pink also has a much more recent book called Drive, but I haven't read it so I can't offer any comparisons.<p>(And speaking of reading, one of the most cited papers on early childhood literacy, by Scarborough & Dobrich, found that reading books to your kids does not actually help their reading skills at all. Why not? They say it's because the most important determinant of later ability is intinsic motivation, and for every parent who is building up their kid's love of reading by reading aloud to them, there is another one who is diminishing it. So if your three year old doesn't like being read to, let them do other stuff for a few months and it may actually benefit them in the long run.)",1350173717

4650177,comment,4649524,4649905,7,0,gosu,,,"I think that the author of the post was trying to address exactly this question of purpose. I'm basically going to reiterate what he said, but here's my own take on it:<p>You can get over your hurdle in two ways:<p>- You can trust that your writing will be exciting for the future you. When I started keeping a journal, it really did seem so forced. But sure enough, when I read it a year later, I was captivated by the forgotten person and experiences on the page.<p>- You can trust that the activity of writing will help the present you to collect and develop his thoughts. Usually, I start a journal entry by writing about some dream, memory, or recent event. In thinking about my reaction to the event, I wind up making a general observation about one of my own beliefs or characteristics. At that point, I forget the event and just go on a tangent about that general topic. An example would be ""Steve was wearing a hat today. I don't like it when people wear hats. I think that hats are [insert thesis here].""<p>I wind up thinking deliberately about something that I've never paid much attention to before, and the act of constructing a written linear narrative forces me to be thorough and precise in a way that my mental narrative isn't. If the topic is some concept that's unrelated to me, then I'd say this helps me to form actual opinions about the world, and to be a more confident in my decision making. I'd also agree with what the post said about ""preoccupations"". And if the topic is myself, then I find that it somehow helps my self-esteem to look at myself from a distance. Everybody looks more graceful from the outside.<p>In trying to collect my thoughts on the original topic, I usually find myself making more claims about other interesting topics - and so I sometimes run out of time to write before I run out of things to write about. An example of this would be the claim that I just made - ""everybody looks more graceful ..."".",1350173643

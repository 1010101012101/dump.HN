29827,comment,29821,29821,0,0,joshwa,,,"A college student is already a risky proposition, part-time makes the potential payoff smaller, and telecommuting means that it's much harder for a hiring manager to judge the ""talented"" part of the equation. <p>So, no. ",1182437781

29825,comment,29595,29595,0,0,Psyonic,,,"Interesting article.  The business definitely seems a bit dirty, and now that registrars themselves are getting into it, I imagine it will get out of hand.  They really need to repeal the 2 or 3 day trial period; I think that would take care of a lot of the speculative purchasing going on.",1182437707
29824,comment,363,363,0,0,joshwa,,,"For some reason, the submit page isn't doing dupe checking anymore-- it doesn't take me directly to the discussion page of the article being resubmitted. This means I have to go back to the homepage and find the article I clicked to find the discussion page. <p>Also, there's no link to the homepage from the submit page-- clicking the icon takes me to the YC main page, not the news.yc main page.

29819,comment,29335,29801,0,0,pg,,,"That's out of left field?  We were writing code in Lisp, with a read-eval-print loop to test stuff, and they were writing code in C++ with ""builds.""  <p>There's nothing preposterous in claiming we could implement a serious feature in a couple hours.  A lot of people could today with Ruby or Python.  But there were no Ruby or Python at the time I'm describing.  (An early form of Python existed, but few used it.)",1182436553

29814,comment,29791,29791,0,0,pg,,,"He picked a bad example.  The guys who wrote 40,000 lines of code in 10 weeks were the founders of Zenter, which just got bought by Google.  Most startups would love to do as badly as Zenter.<p>The reason to plunge in and just start coding is that, as in writing, it helps you to have ideas.  But since that initial hacking is mainly a way of having ideas, you should be ready to discard a lot of it. That is just what the Zenters did.  They rapidly iterated through a bunch of versions, and that's why by Demo Day they had such cool features to wow the audience with.",1182435147

But even assuming that it would be of negligible impact to radiation levels ocean wide (at least, assuming adequate dispersal).<p>Given that it&#x27;s easier to assure adequate dispersal for a continuous low-level transfer to the sea than it is to assure dispersal for effectively dropping the cores into the ocean, I think that dropping the cores into the ocean at once would actually be the worst possible thing.<p>Of course there are real concerns with groundwater contamination too, which might make people think that getting the damaged cores as far away as possible into the ocean is preferable.

I was trying to figure out if there was a way we could convert part of that facility into what would essentially be caves, self heated concrete structures that were impervious to fire, contained internal pipes with a heat transfer fluid to maintain a livable temperature (cooling or warming), a dedicated latrine system that would periodically flush out all waste, and that were nominally &quot;open&quot; but could be enclosed with available materials.

[1]<p>3) For those who do not lose their jobs, the fact that they didn&#x27;t lose their jobs is indicative of more major problems...they either don&#x27;t understand the value of their labor, or they don&#x27;t know how to negotiate with their employers. A minimum wage increase for these people is like treating the symptoms instead of the disease, and without addressing these issues, these people will likely be underemployed for a long time.<p>For those reasons alone, the minimum wage is a terrible way to reduce poverty. A serious answer is three-fold:<p>1) Use real programs to reduce poverty. This means a robust welfare system or a negative income tax or a universal basic income. These cost money, but at least their costs are known, as opposed to the mostly invisible costs of the minimum wage.<p>2) Promote wage transparency laws (which help those who are underpaid to know the true value of their labor). These prohibit employers from firing or retaliating against employees for discussing wages, which is a tactic to keep information asymmetrical in the favor of the employer.<p>3) Abolish the minimum wage.<p>[1] <a href""http://www.nber.org/papers/w5030.pd"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.nber.org/papers/w5030.pdf</a>",1388896480

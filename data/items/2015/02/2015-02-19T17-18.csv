They predict a terminal, descendance-phase ruling class ideology which is simultaneously ‘capitalist anti-capitalist’, ‘human anti-humanist’, and ‘anti-Marxian Marxianist’.  Ruling-class ‘human anti-humanism’ was initially named “Eugenics”, but, after their Hitler-debacle, became their “Big Money” perversion of the global grass roots anti-pollution movement, into “People Are Pollution” ‘Earthism’. The “lawful” degeneration of capitalist, representative democracy into totalitarian, ‘humanocidal’ STATE-capitalism, in the “advanced” nations, is ENABLED by the hyper-concentration of capital-money in ever fewer hands, which, at length, totally obliterates the “checks-and-balances” among the political branches of government, as the descendant-phase plutocracy prostitutes all three branches, plus the news media.  But the desperate, DRIVING MOTIVE behind the plutocracy’s rush to TOTALITARIAN HUMANOCIDE is a deep secret, still not discerned by most observers and theorists.<p>Using this model, they have derived detailed features of the probable higher successor system to capitalism, i.e., of the higher successor “social relation of production” to the capital/wage-labor relation, which they call the “generalized equity social-relation-of-production”, or “political-ECONOMIC DEMOCRACY” -- the “citizen externality equity / citizen birthright equity / citizen stewardship equity Human Rights”-relation. It is decidedly NOT a form of state-bureaucratic-ruling-class STATE-capitalism, a la Leninism, Trotskyism, Stalinism, Hitlerism, Maoism, Castroism, Ceaușescuism, Hoxhaism, ILism, UNism, etc., etc., ad nauseam.<p>The key is to revive checks and balances on political power, as well as to create new checks against concentrated economic power, by instituting unprecedented ECONOMIC CHECKS AND BALANCES.<p>The ‘Associations of [popularly elected, mandated, popularly recallable] Public Directors’ bodies, implementing the ‘Citizens EXTERNALITY Equity’ [‘GRASS ROOTS regulation of deadly local pollution’] Human Right, may be considered an ‘institution-ization’ of the historical experiences of the revolutionary, territorially/residentially-grounded “community councils”.<p>The ‘producers-democracies’ that are the MARKET-COMPETING ‘‘‘socialized producers’ cooperatives’’’ of the ‘Citizen STEWARDSHIP Equity’ [‘collective entrepreneurship’] Human Right [the ‘socialized venture capital’ right] may be considered an ‘institution-ization’ of the historical experiences of the revolutionary, workplace-grounded “workers’ councils”.  Each citizen-steward producer, as such, enjoys, by constitutional and human right, two streams of income:  (1) compensation for time worked, determined via the Skills-Markets, not necessarily equal in amount to that earned by other citizen stewards, and (2) an equal share in the net operating surplus of their Citizen-Stewardship enterprise.<p>The prescription is that the -- concentrated-economic-power-obviated -- POLITICAL checks and balances be “aufheben” retained, as revived by the new ECONOMIC checks and balances, in a new societal system of SUSTAINED QUADRUPLE POWER, with sustained, ‘inter-mutually’ checking-and-balancing conflict among the elected executive, the elected legislative, and the judiciary branches of [popularly-elected] POLITICAL government, and vis-a-vis the ECONOMIC-DEMOCRATIC institutions of ‘‘‘Equitism’’’ -- the social institutions of ‘Citizen Externality Equity’, ‘Citizen Birthright Equity’, and ‘Citizen Stewardship Equity’, described above.<p>This will require a VIGILANT social majority, that knows what it wants -- the better life for all of ‘Political-ECONOMIC DEMOCRACY’ -- and that knows the horrors of the alternative -- Police-State, Totalitarian, Humanocidal State Capitalism, already rampant today in its ‘STEALTH EUGENICS’, ‘STEALTH HUMANOCIDE’ incipient  mode.<p>For more about these historic breakthroughs, see --<p><a href=""http://www.dialectics.org/dialectics/Welcome.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dialectics.org/dialectics/Welcome.html</a><p><a href=""http://www.dialectics.org/dialectics/Glossary_files/Glossary,The_Dialectic_of_Social_Equity,07SEP2014.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dialectics.org/dialectics/Glossary_files/Glossary...</a><p><a href=""http://www.equitism.org/Equitism/Mission/Mission.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.equitism.org/Equitism/Mission/Mission.htm</a><p><a href=""http://www.equitism.org/Equitism/Theory/PoliticalEconomicLawOfMotion/PoliticalEconomicLawOfMotion.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.equitism.org/Equitism/Theory/PoliticalEconomicLaw...</a><p><a href=""http://www.equitism.org/Equitism/Theory/PoliticalEconomicDemocracy/PoliticalEconomicDemocracy.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.equitism.org/Equitism/Theory/PoliticalEconomicDem...</a><p><a href=""http://www.equitism.org/Equitism/AmendmentXXVIII/AmendmentXXVIII.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.equitism.org/Equitism/AmendmentXXVIII/AmendmentXX...</a><p><a href=""http://www.equitism.org/Equitism/MaladyAndRemedy/MaladyAndRemedy.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.equitism.org/Equitism/MaladyAndRemedy/MaladyAndRe...</a><p><a href=""http://capitalismsfundamentalflaw-wayforward.blogspot.com/2014/02/the-fed-psychohistorical-dialectical.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://capitalismsfundamentalflaw-wayforward.blogspot.com/20...</a><p><a href=""http://feddialectics-miguel.blogspot.com/2014/05/part-ii-introduction-dialectic-of-nature.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://feddialectics-miguel.blogspot.com/2014/05/part-ii-int...</a><p><a href=""http://feddialectics-miguel.blogspot.com/2014/05/part-iii-epoch-t-1-atoms-emegent.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://feddialectics-miguel.blogspot.com/2014/05/part-iii-ep...</a><p><a href=""http://feddialectics-miguel.blogspot.com/2014/05/part-iii-b-epoch-t-2-molecules-emergent.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://feddialectics-miguel.blogspot.com/2014/05/part-iii-b-...</a>",1424368542

I visited for a couple of days last summer and found it to be mid-swing -- couldn&#x27;t tell if it was on the way up or on the way down -- but when it&#x27;s up, it can be very diverse and lively, with many seemingly polarised subgroups. Depending on who you talk to, you can come away from Arcosanti thinking that it&#x27;s a bunch of Žižek-spouting primitivists, Kurzweil-spouting extropians, mildly paranoid right-wing survivalists, or reasonably dispassionate architecture graduates with a somewhat environmental bent who were just looking for a stimulating internship.<p>One of Arcosanti&#x27;s strengths is that it can accommodate all of these types simultaneously. But tour guides are given/take quite broad latitude in terms of how they present the project, so depending on who shows you around, you can come away with an impression that it&#x27;s only one of the above subgroups, when in fact it&#x27;s all of them. From what I could see, that tradition continues today, although not quite as vibrant as during my mid-90s tenure.<p>Although Arcosanti accommodates many different modes of thought, paradoxically it&#x27;s been relatively hostile to people who want to push on the boundaries of urban planning and design. When I came there, I was quite enamoured of Soleri&#x27;s &quot;arcology&quot; theory (and today I still am) -- but ultimately, I disagreed with him that cities could be designed as fixed objects; I argued with him that cities were <i>processes</i>, not objects, and that what we really needed to be studying was what kind of processes would lead to arcological outcomes. Soleri, however, was quite defensive and dogmatic about his theory, so I had to leave to pursue that particular thread. Ideas which <i>don&#x27;t</i> particularly impinge upon the built form are far more welcome there. This has been a shortcoming of the place for decades. I&#x27;m hopeful that it will be able to reinvent itself, post-Soleri, to overcome this limitation.",1424367738

Metrics became all the rage with statistical process control, where you monitor production of widgets. The problem is that engineering is by definition not creating the same thing over and over again - if you think it is, go use Excel to send email, and word for web browsing. There are lots of similar things among different pieces of code, and hence design patterns. But good metrics have proven difficult. Lines of code produced turns out to cause people to add redundant comments, and if you exclude comments it causes other things. Closed bugs/issues is better, but to be really effective you need to identify how new bugs are introduced. Some people create as many as they close and that would look good if you monitor closures. Other things have been tried with varying success. The core problem is that engineering is not a well defined process and never will be.<p>Another way to look at is this: none of the marketing metrics he mentions have anything to do with peoples performance. Click rates are a measure of the effectiveness of a marketing strategy, not necessarily the effectiveness of a person in marketing. You use that data to drive decisions about how much to spend on different marketing activities. The equivalent for engineering is to determine how much to spend on each developer. In other words, who to keep and whom to fire, and that shouldn&#x27;t be a really dynamic process.

I’m a huge fan of Android 5.0 Lollipop but in hindsight was prioritising ‘Material Design’ (illustrated above) over combating performance, battery life and fragmentation issues really a wise move? After all Android’s native UI is the first thing most handset makers throw out the window.<p>What? Project Volta focused on Battery Life. They changed the entire runtime to ART for performance. Material design was a much needed solution to coherent UI across Google&#x27;s properties.<p>Also remember that Google brought us HTTP/2 when Microsoft and Apple were completely ignoring the web.<p>GMail is great but they are still bringing Inbox which I find to be a good step towards better Email management. I understand it might now work well for everyone but still, they are trying to evolve it.<p>And they are focusing on moonshot projects while continuing to improve existing successful products in a meaningful way for exactly the same reason - not to be complacent.

Different paid media channels require different strategies, tools, expectations, and most of all: time.<p>Our goal at Kuhcoon is to completely automate the creation, management, monitoring, and optimization of every paid media campaign on the Internet. For now we do this with Facebook Ads, but soon our advertisers will be able to automate their entire paid media strategy across every paid channel on the web.<p>We want to help advertisers of every size spend a few minutes a week telling us how much they want to spend, what their goals and creatives are, and who they plan to target. Our Intelligence System will then automatically segment out their audience during creation, A/B test multiple creatives and messages, pause poor performing ads, create and rotate new ad variants between target segments, and drive the budget into top performing campaigns.<p>The beauty of this automation is that it requires no extra work from the advertiser. There are no complex rule-based systems. There are no unnecessary bell and whistle features. There is no need to anxiously check campaigns every few hours.<p>Give us these three simple data points: budget, creative/conversion goal, and target demographic.

Maybe not technically, but I think it&#x27;s hard enough to work with Emscripten-generated asm.js that it may as well be, and it&#x27;s hard enough to write a large application in asm.js that you probably want to use C/C++ and transpile it to JS with Emscripten.

I noticed this in their EliteBook line since 10 years, so they just don&#x27;t care about it. The keyboard is so-so but acceptable, and the screen of the Folio/G1 ultrabook series is downright bad (strong blue color cast with large sample variability). You can get a matte filter and a replaceable battery in an ultrabook line, which is very good to have, but that stops here. Dell and Lenovo ship way better screens and keyboards for the same specs, which I would definitely recommend for a serious programmer.<p>The 840 G1 I&#x27;m trying now has some ACPI and ATA issues currently on any stock kernel (google for more details).

If one trusts the company that distributes the spyware, it&#x27;s not really a problem, in my opinion. If Valve were to ever violate that trust, it would severely harm their business.<p>I also strongly disagree with DRM, because it only harms other players while providing no benefits. In contrast, online cheaters can completely ruin the playing experience for online games, and have heavily contributed to the death of some games.<p>I also have no issue if people decide to cheat when in single-player mode. If you pay for the game you should be able to do whatever you want if you&#x27;re not affecting others. It&#x27;s only a problem when they&#x27;re playing with other people over the Internet.

Well if they don&#x27;t target asm.js, I&#x27;m not sure how relevant they are to our discussion.  They&#x27;re going to get faster as JavaScript engines become more optimized.  I tried the Scala.js benchmark, and at 1000x1000 and 1 pixel, it took over 10 seconds to render the scene.  I don&#x27;t know what that means, but it felt slow.  I can&#x27;t find comparisons of Scala/Clojure in JavaScript to Scale/Clojure on the JVM, if you know of some, can you point me there?<p>PNaCl won&#x27;t be a standard because of politics.  Technologically, it&#x27;s superior.<p>3. It &quot;might&quot; run.  If you depend on WebGL you can kiss IE support goodbye, for example.  Also &quot;run&quot; ought to come with some sort of baseline performance.  Let&#x27;s say you can run Windows XP via Emscripten.  Don&#x27;t you agree that the attendant speed decrease means that, while it may &quot;run&quot;, it&#x27;s not very useful if you can&#x27;t really use it?",1424365625

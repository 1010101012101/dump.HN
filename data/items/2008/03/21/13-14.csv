142421,comment,142274,142395,0,0,pmjordan,,,"Compiler problems suck, because you start wondering if the rest of your code will start failing in weird and wonderful ways once it reaches the customer. I've had a fair share of compiler/system library issues in game development; the console SDKs I've used were unbelievably flaky, all the way from compiler, build system, debugger to system libraries and hardware itself. Not fun. For many people it becomes difficult to maintain the ""it's always your code's fault"" mantra in that situation.",1206107991

142415,comment,142085,142199,0,0,wallflower,,,"It natural to lose enthusiasm as your responsibilities (to others) grow and your comfort zone gets smaller.<p>This also applies for the software industry (especially mid-to-large size companies). Youthful programmers want to learn the latest hot/cool/interesting technology. After several projects and as they gain pratical experience, youthful programmers start to realize that it's not about what technology is used, there are common problem parameters, regardless of technology. As they start to realize this, they might start settling down (getting married, having a family) and their priorities shift from pounding out interesting code to developing a life. I see this unspoken everyday in the happy-where-I-am-and-just-doing-my-job-nothing-more actions of some people in their 40+s (and shockingly 30s and yes some 20s) in my broader development org. So, the people with the most experience are those who probably delegate to those with the least experience.",1206107629

The appropriate ones (like this) have a lot of upvotes, the others don't.

I don't use a desktop client, and firing up Chatzilla can be annoying as I have a bunch of auto-server and channel joins that take a while to load up (useful for more regular IRC use, but not so much to check a quick channel). I was going to make myself a basic AJAX/Comet web IRC client, but then I found Mibbit, and life became good. :-)",1206106773
142406,comment,142277,142277,0,0,dhimes,,,"What I don't understand is how they always escape investigations into price-gouging.  It happened also with the first Iraqi-American war (Bush 41).  Sen Al D'Amato (sp?) was supposed to lead an investigation into why the companies have record profits in stressful times.<p>They always claim it's ""volume""; their percentage profits are reasonable, but they sell a lot.  Last year I don't think that held--I believe (but am not certain) that usage fell because the prices were so high.<p>But that may just be civilian usage--perhaps total usage increased.  I'd love to see info on that, because I am skeptical and in this election year we may have a shot at changing things.",1206106679

Consider the issue where:<p><pre><code>  String s = (String)(vect.remove(vect.size() - 1));\n</code></pre>\n... throws a NullPointerException, where the code:<p><pre><code>  Object o = vect.remove(vect.size() - 1);\n  String s = (String)o;\n</code></pre>\n... works fine.<p>Can you spot the bug?  No, because there is no good reason for it to fail.  There is no good explanation for a bug like that.

I also worked for a huge software company for a couple of years before striking out on my own and the experience was worth it just to satisfy my curiosity about it, alone. The knowledge of what it is like and resulting lack of second guessing is valuable.<p>Lastly, I think this sort of testing, if you will, is worth doing in general. There were a couple of things I was <i>really</i> curious about trying as a freelancer. Each time, even when it didn't pan out was invaluable in terms of getting to know my own motivations more and refining what I liked, was good at and what I didn't.

Well, we pushed the envelop with Swing, and it was several times where a bug was actually in Swing, and we had to find a workaround in our code while we waited for Sun to fix it.<p>But on the flip side, everytime we saw something weird happen, our knee jerk reaction was, ""Its a bug in Swing"". And our project leader would look at us and say, ""Java works"". His philosophy there was that if your basic assumption is that the tools you are using are broken, you can never get anything done! Start by assuming you made the mistake, and work away from that point.",1206104747

4617089,comment,4616500,4616889,6,0,crntaylor,,,"For those who don't realise, the challenge is to write a function `f` that takes three arguments, the first of which is a function which is applied to the second and third arguments and returned in a pair.<p>The difficulty with doing this in a statically typed system is that once you've fixed the type of the function you pass in, you can't then apply it to two <i>different</i> types. The standard way to solve this would be to specify that the function you pass in is valid for all types [1]<p><pre><code>    f :: (forall s. s -> s) -> a -> b -> (a,b) -- [2]
    f r a b = (r a, r b)

    f id 5 ""Test""   -- returns (5,""Test"")
</code></pre>
However, the challenge also specified that you do it without writing a type signature for `f`. I admit that in this case I am pretty stumped. The closest I can get is to first define a wrapper<p><pre><code>    data S = forall a. Show a => S a
    instance Show S where Show (S a) = show a
</code></pre>
and then write<p><pre><code>    f r a b = (r a, r b)

    f id (S 5) (S ""Test"")    -- returns (5,""Test"")
</code></pre>
but that involves wrapping everything up before passing it into the function, to disguise the fact that we really have different types.<p>There's an interesting point to be made here, though - ""wrapping everything up in one type"" is essentially what dynamic type systems do, except that it's baked into the language instead of being implemented by the programmer on an as-needed basis.<p>Here, my declaration for the type S says ""any type as long as it has a Show instance"" (which allows it to be printed). I could instead have specified ""any type that has a Num instance"" which would mean that I could pass in a mix of ints and floats, and still do arithmetic with them. I get some of the benefits of dynamic typing (flexibility) but I still get to keep type checking.<p>The Python approach is ""any type, and we'll check at runtime that it has the appropriate methods"". So it's ultimately flexible, but as a result loses any form of compile-time checking.<p>Looking at it this way, I think that the challenge you've set me is one that cuts to the core of the difference between dynamic and static type systems. No, I can't write the function you want in a statically typed language without doing <i>something</i> clever with types. But the clever thing I have to do with types is re-invent duck typing, but in a limited way which still gives me compile-time checking.<p>Anyhow, thanks for the insightful comment. It certainly made me think...<p>[1] This requires the language extensions ExistentialQuantification and Rank2Types, but neither of those are particularly controversial.<p>[2] Note that the type signature<p><pre><code>    forall a. a -> a
</code></pre>
is inhabited by exactly one function - the identity function. This carries over to the Python example too - the function `f` isn't safe to use unless the
first argument is the identity function, which makes it a bit of a useless function to define in the first place.",1349448374

Apply your compressor to each one, so that you have reduced the length of each file to 99 bits. But the number of 99-bit long files is half the number of 100-bit long files, which means that for some of your compressed files, you can't tell exactly which 100-bit long file it corresponds to.<p>Now, you can perform run length encoding on some files. That looks for runs of repeated bits, replaces them with a special marker, and writes a dictionary to translate the marker to the run. You can look for patterns. This will work... on some files. Not on all.<p>A good compressor will try several different encoding schemes to do its work, and is going to succeed on files with embedded patterns. For instance, if the file is ASCII text, lots of bit patterns will never occur, and lots will occur repeatedly. If the file is English ASCII text, even more redundancy can be exploited. If the file is a structured data set, there's almost certainly a bunch of repeating patterns.<p>But for purely random data, there won't be enough patterns repeated enough to exploit.",1349448090

4617054,story,,,1,3,tonymarks,"Does Obama actually want another term as president?",,"by Robert Reich.
As I watched the debate Wednesday night I had a brief, passing thought that's probably wrong -- but I can't seem to shake it. I asked myself what if, in his heart of hearts, Obama doesn't really want another term as president? He seemed tired and listless in a way that ran deeper than being worn out from the ongoing demands of the presidency. I don't think he loves politics, certainly not the way Bill Clinton loves it. In fact, I suspect Obama puts up with much of it because he believes it's a means to accomplishing what must be done. But I've been around people who have held that job, and I have a sense of how extraordinarily taxing it can be -- particularly now, in this era of vitriol and partisan gridlock. So what if at some level, perhaps at a level he's not even fully aware of, he doesn't really want it any more?<p>Romney, on the other hand, strikes me as a man with boundless ambition -- ambition I've only seen in the sons of men who have been president or have sought the job, ambition of a sort that enables Romney to say or do anything and be anyone, turn himself into a chameleon if necessary, to achieve the prize. I don't think Romney loves politics, and I don't believe the energy and passion we witnessed Wednesday night emerges from any wellspring of deep conviction -- in fact, he's changed his position on almost everything. I think the energy and passion comes from his sheer determination to do what must be done, because he loves the idea of himself as president.<p>So the thought I can't get out of my head is we may have witnessed on the stage Wednesday night two men whose ambitions are trending in opposite directions -- a president who has had enough, and a challenger who can't get enough. I hope I'm wrong.",1349447940

Types are a mathematical theory in which you are able to prove things about the terms of you program.<p>Datatypes are like types but without the structure or logic. They don't prove anything and are basically just sets. You have to bring your own rules. Dynamic languages are unityped, you can see this by noting working only on just a <i>top</i> type shares many properties (not all, e.g. flexibility) of being in a dynamic language. Dynamic languages however can have datatypes, which make sure operations on the collections a particular object inhabits makes sense according to rules the language designer defines.<p>For your example, in a dynamic language I can state that r,a and b all belong to the same type but their datatypes may vary from moment to moment. In a statically typed language I cannot. Without types a ST language will assume that a and b are the same universal type. But I could give just <i>a</i> a top type and then your example would work. But I lose type safety. To get it back I could use interfaces, inheritance or algebraic datatypes each with their own pros and cons.",1349447874

Another reason is that the business demands it. Let me give you an example. There is a story that the folks at WordPerfect, which had (and still has, if my mother is any indication) fiercely loyal customers.  They had a very family-oriented company culture, and nobody stayed past 5.  Microsoft did not go home at five, except maybe at 5 am.  Microsoft ate their lunch.<p>In several situations, I could not get access to computers until after the day shift went home. In Portland, while on co-op during college, I would walk to work at about 0200. The path took me past a bakery that was in full-on baking mode. While building a real-time medical data system, we had one production computer and a second computer that was occasionally used for production at night, so we worked nights to integrate both parts of production so that the other computer would be available for development all day.<p>And sometimes a problem will grab you and not let you go. The story of fluidics has as its beginning a 36 hour creative burst by its major contributor.

[... ] Great confusion results from trying to find a world view in which 'type' really means the same thing in both systems. It doesn't. [ ... ] Many programmers approach the question of whether they prefer static or dynamic types by comparing some languages they know that use both techniques. [ ... ] The problem, in this case, is that most programmers have limited experience, and haven't tried a lot of languages. For context, here, six or seven doesn't count as 'a lot.' On top of that, it requires more than a cursory glance to really see the benefit of these two very different styles of programming. Two interesting consequences of this are: 1) Many programmers have used very poor statically typed languages. 2) Many programmers have used dynamically typed languages very poorly.""</i>",1349446457

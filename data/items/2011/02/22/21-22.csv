Building relationships is far more valuable in my mind then anything else you can do. While having a killer portfolio is good, just like resumes often times porfolios are not as authentic as one would have you believe.  Quality relationships that can give you referrals or references are by far the most valuable thing you can develop.<p>I worked for a large company here in the states that outsourced all of their development to India, we had about 100 full time developers on staff.  That team no longer exists however whenever I need to outsource I go to the relationships I established from that team to either contract directly with them or get recommendations from them.<p>It might not be what you want in the short term, however it is a great way to make connections and reduce the barrier to entry for you.<p>In my mind the barrier to entry for most startups is time and to a certain extent money.  I know I cannot afford to take flyers on developers who I don't have confidence will deliver for me on time and on budget and what is worse if someone fails to deliver not only am I late but I am also out anything I may have paid for the work.<p>I hope this advice assists you in some way.",1298411529

At that time, I even started a master's program with an emphasis on machine learning in order to code this project better and my thesis advisor was an author of one of the machine learning books that's being recommended at hackerbooks.com and probably one of the best academic I can study on machine learning).

2251666,comment,2251445,2251445,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"At the risk of sounding presumptuous, since I have another one of the sites you mention, I think I need to say a couple of things.<p>It's a mistake to view all these book sites as somehow enemies of each other. The simple fact is, at 7% commission and an audience of 100K or so, you aren't going to be buying yachts off the Mediterranean coast any time soon. hn-books was a hobby site for me. I used it to test out a few different ideas I had about how to deploy internet apps. The only reason you keep seeing posts from hn-books is because I had a bet with JacquesM about how viable the site would be. I thought it was nothing more than a lark, while Jacques thought it had a lot of potential. So I thought doing a dozen book reviews or so would at least show traction or not. So far I'm winning the bet.<p>The second thing is that execution beats everything else. I spent 2 weeks on hn-books and I was done with it. No more coding, no more anything. I don't sit around and obsess over it, I don't plan all kinds of new features, and I don't worry about how it's traffic compares to others. The only thing I worry about hn-books is that it gets enough votes when I post a review to come off the ""no-follow"" list. And that's simply because the bet with Jacques wouldn't be fair if it didn't. A lot of you guys have spent ten times as much time as I spent on hn-books and still don't have anything to show for it. Maybe a little less thinking and a little more execution? We have a couple dozen guys with site ideas and only a few deployed? Surely we can do better than that.<p>So if you want to do books, have fun with it! Try some new stuff out. Do something you've never done before. But whatever you do, don't sit around planning or dreaming up how it might be great or horrible or how your competitors might do this or that. All of that is just a waste of time. Execute. Then decide if you want to keep working on your site or move on to something else.<p>Yes, you can do some Chinese Math and convince yourself that there is a fortune in tech books and somehow we're all in some cutthroat competition. But do yourself a favor: don't do that. You can execute perfectly and still fail completely. So worrying won't get you anywhere. In the end, a site like you want has to be for yourself first, the community second. If you start thinking outside of that, you're probably wasting energy.<p>Also, I would be careful about taking every comment over in that thread as some kind of to-do list. There's a difference between asking a bunch of folks to comment randomly on some neat site and figuring out exactly what you need to do to accomplish some goal. Sometimes you just have to say no.<p>BTW, I posted a link to hackerbooks on my blog. I'm happy to post a link to your site as well when it comes up. Just let me know. I refuse to make this competitive. This should be something that helps everybody out. I'm hoping to learn some stuff from you guys! I'm excited about all the ideas out there.<p>Recently I've thought that after I do the first dozen or so books, I might continue on for a while. But not because of any great business plan: I just like reading great books and reviewing great tools and talking about how cool they are. I know some people think that's pumping the tools or books, but I like 'em, they've helped me, and I'm going to explain why I like 'em. Screw everybody else. I think you have to work from inside out on this stuff. (Quite frankly, my advice to you is if you want to execute on something to make a few dollars, find something besides books. For some reason, everybody and their brother are into books nowadays. Edw is right: if you want to make money, find somebody with money who is in pain and help them, don't concentrate on scratching your own itch so much.)<p>Let us know how it goes!",1298410255

The wisdom amongst the masses is that if you co-found or join a startup, you are playing roulette with your financial security.<p>But the article's point -- which I agree with -- is that even if you accelerate this process of getting to that 5 year threshold, you are doing yourself a disservice fiscally by settling in at the plateau unless you have a good reason forcing you into settling.<p>You're likely still learning more, and becoming more valuable, but it becomes much more difficult to extract that value through salary.

The problem is that when you're running a high number of Django instances (via a large number of daemons) you can get all sorts of problems with Apache itself. Some of these issues have been due to mod_wsgi, and Graham has, in my past experiences, been very responsive about fixes. Other issues are simply due to Apache, and when you're running multiple instances in a memory-restricted environment you're left with a tough configuration job. I've even had a case where thread contention in a low-memory setup caused a complete Apache lock-up.<p>So, as you can see, for the normal case the recommended setup is fine, but for extreme cases you should use the combination with caution.<p>YMMV, of course, but if you're pushing your setup to the limit and don't have any options for extra servers, I would heartily recommend uwsgi+nginx or fcgi+lighttpd instead.",1298409523

A non-blocking server is a natural for that task.<p>One of the other ideas the interview mentions, that I don't think is mentioned for the ""cloud"" enough, is the having data reside on the same machine (node :-)) as the software that analyzes it. If you're going to spread out over many machines why not stay local as much as possible. There is added overhead for administration but that can be automated.",1298408685

I can come up with three (UT, TAMU, Rice) and a few more if you set the bar a bit lower, but none of the these (arguably Rice) is in the league of Stanford, Berkeley, and Caltech, and only the first three are in the same league as UCLA, UCD, UCSD, UCI and USC.  Even UCSB and UCSC are good.<p>Perhaps what I'm trying to say is that as wonderful as Texas is, if you're interested in universities it is sadly lacking.

For debit card transactions, the interchange fee is -- on average -- 1.8% . This goes to the bank, and becomes the bare minimum for swipe fees.<p>Assuming that the Fed goes ahead and implements their proposed rules, interchange fees will drop to less than $.12 for most debit transactions.

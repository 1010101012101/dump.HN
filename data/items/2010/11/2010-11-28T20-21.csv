1948209,comment,1947723,1947864,0,0,jerf,,,"Ironically for people still criticizing ""len"" as a function, it is now the <i>more</i> acceptable way of accomplishing the task than what Ruby is doing in many circles. In Python, len is a generic function that can call anything that implements a certain interface. This is more correct that baking the ""len"" function in somewhere in the object hierarchy, or implementing it relatively randomly throughout the hierarchy with a series of ""len"" methods that may or may not actually be connected. (len isn't the best example since it's in the ""standard set"", but in general just because two methods have the same name doesn't mean, well, anything in particular, really.) Favoring interfaces over inheritance leads you to the Python solution, not the Ruby solution. Python's arguably not merely ""OK"" but <i>more</i> right than Ruby here, if you are really going to be an OO purist (of certain flavors).<p>Python then actually ends up taking advantage of this by having len able to use any of <i>several</i> interfaces. It may call double-underscore-len, but it may also traverse an iterator. It could potentially do other things as well. It's actually a straightforward application of the ""prefer interfaces over inheritance"" to the dynamic language case. You can criticize the spelling of the double-underscore methods (which if you are <i>really</i> grumpy, can actually be fixed by a metaclass, though I think the cost/benefit tradeoff is bad unless you are the <i>only</i> person who will ever use that code), but if you haven't used them you may not realize just how finely tuned they are, and how well they work with the functions that actually search over the interfaces to find the best one to use in a way somewhat difficult to replicate directly with a ""method"".",1290976553

Given a default position (fingertips hovering above middle row) each of my ten fingers has learned how to reach for and connect with each letter key. After reaching for a letter and tapping it my fingers immediately return to the default position. To type a capital letter I quickly tap shift with the pinky opposite the hand that will reach for that letter and then it's business as usual. Same goes for the symbol keys on the second page. This system minimizes the unique muscle movements needed to type the full spectrum of letters, numbers, and symbols. Sure: I'm making more key presses to type a single symbol in the current system, but many of those keystrokes are motions that I have learned to make very rapidly since they are used so often.<p>In this new scheme I'd be learning a new movement for each capitalization and special character.

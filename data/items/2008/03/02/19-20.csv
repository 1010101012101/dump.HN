There's stuff that you want the world (or at least your friends) to know about, and there's stuff that matters or is appropriate only to you.<p>LiveJournal understood this deeply.  At times it doesn't feel like Facebook does.",1204487861

127522,comment,127453,127453,0,0,inovica,,,"I'm 38 now and can't pull the long hours I used to.  I discovered that yoga really helps - much of the stress I'd been experiencing has faded away and I have more energy, feel more alive and have a better posture (even whilst seating) from doing it.  It took time though - it took about 3 months before I really 'got it'. Hope this helps anyone out there who's 'getting on' like me and who wants a low-impact way of exercising",1204487366

127514,comment,126809,126822,0,0,dkasper,,,"News.YC in my understanding is not a forum or a discussion group, it is a way to quickly find new interesting links.  Sure, commenting on the articles is great, but polls and the like are not news, and not usually new or interesting (imho).  I think sites like Reddit, Digg, News.YC get watered down when they start adding ""features"" like this.",1204486525

127506,comment,126608,127487,0,0,shiranaihito,,,"There are some similarities between Finland and Japan that I've noticed or heard of.<p>Both countries have a relatively high suicide-rate.<p>Both societies frown upon someone who changes jobs frequently, and being unemployed is considered shameful and terrible in general.<p>The way we travel in public transports seems to be the same too. Everyone just sits there in silence :)<p>On a happier note, our languages often sound surprisingly similar.<p>- For example there are words in the Finnish language that happen to sound like words in the Japanese language.<p>The meanings are different of course, but at least to me, saying the word ""sato"" sounds exactly the same in both languages. In Finnish it means ""crop"" (as in what you reap), and in Japanese it means ""village"".<p>There are probably quite a few others like that.<p>I've been told that Finns most resemble the people in Hokkaido, the northmost area in Japan where the climate is supposedly like (southern?) Finland.<p>Germany? Maybe they're as methodological in Japan?<p>I studied German for about 5 years at school (voluntarily even), but nowadays I can probably make it through more sentences in Japanese without breaking any.<p>As far as I remember, we didn't hear much about their culture..<p>They had a fun way of wishing good luck though: ""Hals- und Beinbruch!"", which means something like ""Neck- and leg-fractures!"", as in ""Break a leg!"" :)<p>Well, you guys do belong in the same family of languages after all..<p>In Finland we just settle for saying ""Onnea!"" as in ""Luck!"".",1204485979

My personal internet endeavors are small-scale enough that I have been able to host my own domain services on my own machines for years.  I ALMOST tried to write my own system for running my blog, but in the end I went with Wordpress, which seems to allow enough homebrew (no pun intended[1]) HTML and the like in my posts to do what I want.  Plus, I have just enough of a grasp of PHP that I think I can set up my own custom extensions when the time comes and I feel the need.<p>[1] As a computer-nerd turned microbiologist, one of the topics I expect to pop up on my blog regularly is homebrewing, from a somewhat nerdier than usual perspective.",1204485809

One thought I've had would be the Airbnb model, but given that it's way more niche than finding a place to stay for vacation, I think this would have to be tested with an audience who is in dire need of this.

But while I think some of the author's problems are self-imposed (close your windows when you're done with them!), I agree with the sentiment. I've been an Apple user since 1986 and I've never seen them get closer to Microsoftian behavior than in the last year.<p>For another great example of this, look at Airport Utility 5 vs 6.<p>You gain:<p><pre><code>  * A big shiny globe and background  \n  * iOS-style badges for firmware upgrades\n</code></pre>\nYou lose:<p><pre><code>  * Client lists  \n  * Logging and statistics  \n  * IPv6 settings  \n  * Wireless multicast rate, txpower, 40MHz channels, interference robustness  \n  * Printer support  \n  * I'm sure some other stuff\n</code></pre>\nI learned this the hard way the other day. I went to look up a DHCP client and found the table no longer exists! The recommended solution is to install Airport utility 5 ALONGSIDE Airport utility 6. What?! I completely understand the Apple mantra of simple usability, but the power user functions have always been hidden behind that veneer. Now they're just GONE.",1330801055

Apple is all about a unified entertainment experienced (check), beautiful design (check), and making things simple for the user (check check double check). Programmers aren't users. They're programmers. While we sit here and bitch over the choices in Lion which I myself also hate to a degree we forget that almost every other computer user on earth is lucky if they can even find the power button. Hang out with techies long enough and you start to believe every user is just like you. You're a minority, pal. Apple isn't going downhill but you may have outgrown them.

SSDs shouldn't be a requirement for a desktop. An OS can have all the fancy features in the world, but there shouldn't be any reason for a computer to use <i>all</i> your resources for an OS-level operation. I've been waiting for the day when a OS can boot itself then trickle in the rest of the startup features in a way to minimize the impact on performance. Windows does a lot of maintenance in the background when you're not using it, causing a lot of people to complain that ""Windows is using 4GB of RAM just for itself!"" But when another program requests that memory or that CPU time, Windows gives it up and delays whatever it was doing. Why can't this be universal, and why can't it apply to booting the OS as well?",1330800328

Of course getting no response to DNS doesn't ALWAYS mean the domain is available but it's generally fairly accurate.

3660731,comment,3660417,3660704,5,0,_delirium,,,"There's a longitudinal problem as well, in that most of the interesting aspects of productivity improvements come over longer time scales, with large projects and people who have already gotten up to speed on them. Those are extremely difficult/expensive to do controlled studies with. Medicine does them, but 5-year studies in medicine are quite expensive, logistically complex, and have a lot of institutional support because it's considered so important to run them. In HCI, user studies are typically of a shorter length, like A/B-testing one UI paradigm versus another in 30-minute user sessions. Applied to PLs, it's feasible to do user studies looking at learning curves, but much less feasible to answer how Haskell compares to C++ on a large project. Instead, like in economics, the best you can do often ends up being to look for ""natural experiments"" where almost-comparable things happened in different languages, and try to compare them.<p>A few software-engineering researchers have told me that that's one major reason that recent ""tools"" type SE-research happens outside academia: if someone in academia had invented git, it's not clear how they would design a user study to evaluate it, especially within the constraints of, say, a PhD thesis timescale/budget. The typical/simple study design is you recruit N participants, randomly assign N/2 to your tool and N/2 to the control tool, have them perform a task, and then try to show with p<0.05 that the group using your tool did better than control. But in this case, the ""perform a task"" step has to be non-trivial, and it tends not to be feasible to recruit people to participate in a random study that involves them developing serious software over several years, which would be the equivalent of the kinds of randomized studies that are done with medical devices.<p>I don't actually find the case-study-based approach particularly bad. Start from cases that are awkward or error-prone to handle in a language (either constructed or derived from data about real-world errors), and propose a solution that captures the underlying computation more directly, or in a more checkable way, etc. There are other areas that make progress in that manner; for example, symbolic logic develops with a case-study and counter-example-driven methodology, where someone will propose a case that either can't be represented in Logic X, or at least can't easily be represented, or maybe produces incorrect inferences when encoded in the obvious way, and this will drive development of a Logic X'.",1330799643

I won't say why, but I'm privy to almost all communications, and the big players we've been talking to lately and the interest they've communicated tells me a lot, and I think there is a strong likelyhood this company will likely have a few million at least within a year, with further potential beyond that.  I've been there for 5 months as an intern breaking even financially at less than $9 dollars an hour.  They have trusted me with so many things, and I've done so many little things that are hard to put a value on, from product design to dealing directly with customers, building and manning a booth at trade shows, to marketing and web design, to literally modifying the early products, packaging and shipping them.  I got an immense spike in traffic awhile back (10,000pageview/day - which earned the first online sale) and I have personally interacted with so many different potential buyers.  I pleased our first and only refundee to reconsider, and they will likely be buying more in the future.<p>They all really like me.  I've gone beyond what they've expected of me.  The CEO has already told me he wants me to remain their full-time since I know the product better than anyone else.  I am literally his right-hand man (okay, slave :P) fixing every tiny problem he can't do himself (website, his phone, you name it).  My boss has already told me if it made it ""Apple big... or maybe not THAT big..."" that I would be completely taken-care of.  I understand skepticism to such a statement, and with anyone else I wouldn't think much of it, but he built a successful business of 20 years before this and is one of the most stand-up guy's I've ever known.   I know and trust his character very well; I have faith in almost nothing, and I have faith in him.<p>My dilemma is I'm supposed to return to school this upcoming spring quarter far away in a different city.  I'm at a very critical point, and I've already pushed finishing school back a few years, so I'm in my mid-20s, and the heat from my family (and myself) to finish school is strong.<p>I would very much like to remain working with this company considering it's potential upside, but I'm not sure how to ask whether staying around would be worth my while.  This won't get ""Apple-big,"" but it is definitely a potentially amazing opportunity that could rocket me places a degree would never really offer.  Worst case scenario, I return to school a few months later.<p>While the experience and potential foot in the ground floor of a new technology is great and all, my shit wage isn't going to do it for me.<p>I would really like to get somewhere around $15/hour for the time being, but I would't consider staying around if the possible BIG upside weren't a big factor.  Really, how do I ask for more 'reassurance' for putting my education (and life) on hold for a bit to help make this great?

Where it differs really is that the user-tagging is explicit (though I assume that Google still have that tagging ""game"" in place) and that the images that Pinterest host are larger [full-sized?]. I see re-pinning as akin to providing a link to a Google Image search page; the service provider in both cases has initially made the image copy and the user has simply referenced that and added meta-data.<p>Now I do think things are a bit more fuzzy in the situation where the user causes the Pinterest service provider to acquire the image. But again it is the service provider that is retaining the copy of the creators work. Moreover if you just choose to ""pin it"" when you add rather than upload then you don't even locally store the images.<p>Where things get really interesting to me is if you use Pinterest (which I assume is a USA based service) to get content from another country. Pinterest should find that they're subject to the local laws but the user should only be subject (to my mind) to USA law and their own local laws. This could cause some major problems for Pinterest IMO.<p>In short, to my view it looks like the liability for any tortuous action WRT copyright lies with Pinterest and not the user excepting if the user uploads directly.<p>This is of course not legal advice.",1330797654

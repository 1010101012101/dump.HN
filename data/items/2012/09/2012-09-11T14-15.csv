When a geek approaches me (or I approach them) to be the suit for their project, I usually give them some simple soft skill to do - like go out and talk to potential customers and get feedback from say 500 in a day.<p>Finally, before I even consider hustling customers and investors I want some paltry measure of ability. If you can hack something together in 24-48 hours or even a week, then they're quality geek co-founder material. Any longer and it's a judgement call. Most won't get past step one, and you certainly didn't want them as a co-founder.<p>I have learned this the hard way. I raised money only to find out my tech co-founder couldn't push code in a timely manner.

I'll try to stick to the NDA, but I'd just like an answer regarding what I view as a major privacy issue. By the way, I had another account on HN but lost access to it in the transition away from clickpass.<p>To summarise the issue: iOS6's Facebook integration allows me to simply add a stranger's phone number and then, in most cases, retrieve their Facebook photo, URL, name and occasionally email addresses and sometimes, though infrequently, actual addresses, depending on the user's Facebook privacy settings.<p>Steps to recreate the issue:<p>1. Link your Facebook account to the device<p>2. Add a person's phone number<p>3. Go to Settings > Facebook and tap ""Update Contacts""<p>4. Return to the Contacts app and there is a high chance that you will now have this person's photo, a link to their Facebook profile, and potentially other information, all from a phone number. Something which I don't believe can be done through any other means.<p>I find this to be a major breach of privacy, and I don't see how Apple or Facebook would allow this. I thought the point was to synchronise information from existing Facebook friends, not strangers.<p>I apologise if this is old news but I'd have thought this would be a huge issue with the tech communityparticularly since it involves Apple and Facebookand I check HN, Reddit, etc. daily.<p>Thank you",1347375380

That may be fine argument for FP being inevitable...</i><p>Except that that argument would fall on the wrong side of history.  Most the really big examples of successful high-concurrency systems are programmed using imperative languages, and have been all along.  And they do it using mostly the same habits that a lot of FP advocates would like to suggest are the exclusive domain of functional languages.  Personally I like to think of them less as an excuse for functional apotheosis than as ""elementary coding standards"", but I learned Lisp before C++ so perhaps I'm just showing my age there.<p>Now there are spots where FP offers a serious win on the concurrency front. Continuation passing comes to mind immediately.  It'd be nice if the outspoken contingent of FP fans would spend a bit more time talking up node.js.  But I suppose it's silly to expect Javascript to be held up as a successful functional language. It spends much too much time rubbing elbows with the object-oriented hoi polloi for that.",1347375108

If the work you produce doesn't make money, then you should consider who is at fault.

This is the only case where integrity can be bought (by sacrificing potential work).<p>Servicing is all about satisfying the needs of other individuals - in the case of businesses, this is always to make more money. As soon as you grasp this, you will start approaching potential customers with the foresight to tell them you want to make them money, hourly, vs. you want to charge them money, hourly.<p>I'd say the best preparation would be to save up money in advance, so that you may work a couple of months without getting paid.

If you are like me and you can only focus on client work for around 6 hours per day, then 1500 hours will be your ceiling.

4505452,comment,4504685,4504685,5,0,nchuhoai,,,"As a native Berliner and ex-Bostonian, I have to unfortunately concur with the article. There is quite a lot of talk. While I love Berlin as a city, and even love the generally positive and helpful atmosphere of the startup scene in Berlin, there is no denial that doing a startup is the hip thing to do, and it wouldn't hurt some people to get to work.<p>""I'm CEO of a startup"" is a phrase I have heard way more than in the Valley or in Boston. For me a bit surprising as a native, was the aforementioned influx of consultants and management grads. It has become so sexy to do a startup. Or asking for technical co-founders.<p>However, as much as we can criticize this development, I believe it's generally positive that more people are trying to question the status quo, trying to find alternatives to the coorperate route. As far as I remember, that hasn't been the case a couple years ago. So sure, we should be vary of the hype, but we can go back to the roots and steer all this energy into the right direction.<p>On that note, here comes a shameless plug:
We are a Boston-started, Berlin-relocated startup that wants more people to use p2p-marketplaces such as Airbnb etc. We do so by helping marketplaces battle the largest friction for a transaction: trust. Our mission is the belief that a world in which we can trust each other is a better world, a world worth building. If you think so too, we'd love to talk to you. (nam@webcred.co)",1347372306

I've been steering things towards Groovy or Ruby for new projects, largely using productivity as the justification. Top push backs from upper management have been:
1) Universities we recruit from teach Java & most prospective employees already know Java
2) Costs of retraining workforce 
3) They don't understand those langs can be utilized with our current JVM ecosystem<p>I feel pretty much all those reasons are specious and really shouldn't be holding things back. We've got a foothold established with success of some smaller projects using Groovy and Ruby to ""prove"" their viability. I'd like to try Scala next to see how it would fit for some of our other projects.<p>TLDR: At least one large company is making efforts to evolve beyond just Java in the JVM.",1347372304

4505449,comment,4503914,4505315,5,0,astine,,,"The USSR was falling apart in the 1960's during the Cuban missile crisis? I've actually studied the downfall of the Soviet Union and the notion that it fell apart simply because of economic or political pressures is rather simplistic.<p>The problem with the USSR over it's entire existence is that it had trouble maintaining legitimacy. The Communist Party effectively ruled the country but it's legitimacy was derived from revolutionary nature. The further the Party strayed from the promotion of world-wide Communism, its entire modus operandi, the more clear it became that it actually ruled for itself.<p>With this in mind, the Communist Party had to maintain a state of constant belligerence with the United States and the Western world and had to promote international Communism with every chance it got. International Communism <i>had</i> to be its end game and this entailed, ultimately, war with America.<p>When Gorbachev took control and softened relations with the United States, as well as shifted control of the country from the Party to the Government, he actually weakened his right to rule and that is one of the many reasons he was ultimately deposed.<p>While it is certainly true American politicians used the Cold War for political ends, It's simply not true that the Soviet Union was no threat, or that the threat was even vastly overblown. The documentary you mention is comical in that is is both fear mongering <i>and</i> condemning fear mongering.",1347372262

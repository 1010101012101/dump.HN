4574864,comment,4563323,4567081,1,0,tluyben2,,,"I have experimented a lot with stuff I have and wearables are coming closer to interesting use. For instance I picked up a second hand Twiddler one hand keyboard/mouse and with some practice I can program with it a bit. Then hooking that up to a rooted smartphone with Linux seems to work fine. Allowing me to 'program' a bit while walking, but of course with the phone on my left wrist and Twiddler in right hand, it doesn't allow for very stable viewing/typing. Best would be augmented reality, where the augmented part is a projected, stable screen on the right-middle side of my right eye with a usable resolution (so not Recon). Then programming I think about the issue for a while and then write code; this seems to match that model particularly well and it's actually how I work at home. I stand in front of 'something' (can be a tv or window or ...) and my laptop is on my right on a standing table. I contemplate the problem and move my concentration to the right to the screen when I found a 'solution'. I think this would work well. However, there are no augmented reality devices ready for this. I tried a few and they gave me headaches or were quite uncomfortable.<p>Guess it's waiting for Glass or something to hurry the .... up. But that'll probably be disappointing as well; seems we are quite far removed from this. So for now I'm focusing on the software side, like having a live/reactive, predictive programming language which can be used almost only with alphanum chars. I have a lispy (but it would work with all lisps which don't have syntactic sugar) which predicts the parentheses well enough to almost never having to type them. This helps with entering code faster with one handed keyboards and voice (which I think is a dead end btw). However the issue which always arises is editing code, not adding code. That is also something you can reason about and try to solve without having the actual hardware, so it's something i'm working on. When I have time (i'm in a startup, unrelated to this hobby right now), I will blog about everything. I promised myself this will be before the end of the year ;)",1348652826

Saying that, I'm writing from the UK, a developed country that has attempted to raid another country's embassy to extract a political asylum seeker, most likely with the thought of eventually having him deported to the US, where he'd be murdered or
held indefinitely.<p>On the other hand, it shows the precarious nature of YouTube as a medium. They're not responsible for the content because... What? Google says so? Up until the recent times, we were used to channels taking at least some responsibility for the content they're carrying. Do the TV channels and newspapers not have to worry about privacy issues or about being libellous or slandering? Are the bookshops not
prevented from stocking illegal, potentially harmful books? It's very convenient and cost-saving for Google to say: ""sorry guys, we know we earn $billions but it's all on user-generated content, so we have no control over it."" Perhaps that situation will change in the future and Google will have to comply with local regulations, although that'd bring a host of other issues with it.<p>I largely see Google as a force for good. However, there's a thin line that could be crossed and could lead to the company imposing its own, sometimes US-centred views, on the local nations.

Illegal low cost calling cards often steal service by doing this. If there was a way to also retrieve the user's phone number, I can imagine a system where you dial the calling card company, input your code and the number you want to dial.... It tells you that it's trying to connect you and that it may take a couple of minutes... It snares the next person caught out on the website, sets their call forward to the number you want to dial, then dials that subscriber for you and connects.

<a href=""http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0285/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0285/</a><p><pre><code>    4) Should we strive to eliminate non-Boolean operations on bools
       in the future, through suitable warnings, so that for example
       True+1 would eventually (in Python 3000) be illegal?

    => No.

       There's a small but vocal minority that would prefer to see
       ""textbook"" bools that don't support arithmetic operations at
       all, but most reviewers agree with me that bools should always
       allow arithmetic operations.

    6) Should bool inherit from int?

    => Yes.

       In an ideal world, bool might be better implemented as a
       separate integer type that knows how to perform mixed-mode
       arithmetic.  However, inheriting bool from int eases the
       implementation enormously (in part since all C code that calls
       PyInt_Check() will continue to work -- this returns true for
       subclasses of int).  Also, I believe this is right in terms of
       substitutability: code that requires an int can be fed a bool
       and it will behave the same as 0 or 1.  Code that requires a
       bool may not work when it is given an int; for example, 3 & 4
       is 0, but both 3 and 4 are true when considered as truth
       values.

</code></pre>
Compatibility<p><pre><code>    Because of backwards compatibility, the bool type lacks many
    properties that some would like to see.  For example, arithmetic
    operations with one or two bool arguments is allowed, treating
    False as 0 and True as 1.  Also, a bool may be used as a sequence
    index.

    I don't see this as a problem, and I don't want evolve the
    language in this direction either.  I don't believe that a
    stricter interpretation of ""Booleanness"" makes the language any
    clearer.</code></pre>",1348650806

4574759,comment,4574713,4574713,3,0,gjulianm,,,"C# has a lot of these little things, that can make you struggle until you discover them.<p>But beware with yield-return, you have to be very conscious of the execution model of LINQ. Take for example this piece of code:<p><pre><code>    IEnumerable<string> Readlines(Stream io)
    {
        while(io.CanRead)
        {
           io.Read(buffer, 0, bufferLength)
           ... do things with buffer and get a line...
           yield return line;
        }
    }
    
    IEnumerable<string> ReadFileLines(string filename)
    {
        IEnumerable<string> lines
        using(FileStream file = new FileStream(filename))
        {
           lines = ReadLines(file);
        }
        return lines;
    }
</code></pre>
This would <i>always</i> fail and throw an exception. Why? When you call ReadLines, the actual object that is returned is not the list of strings. ReadLines is not executed until that list is not enumerated. ReadFileLines opens the stream, passes it as an argument and then closes the stream. When you enumerate that list, ReadLines will start and try to access a closed stream, which causes an exception. Read more here: <a href=""http://blogs.msdn.com/b/charlie/archive/2007/12/09/deferred-execution.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.msdn.com/b/charlie/archive/2007/12/09/deferred-...</a><p>EDIT: Another problem that you could face with deferred execution is that you could execute a method multiple times without noticing.<p><pre><code>    var lines = ReadLines(file);
    var count = lines.Count();
    var text = lines.Aggregate("""", (acc, x) => x + acc);
</code></pre>
This would read all the lines two times (one for count and another for aggregate), and would probably throw another exception because the EOF had been reached in the first execution. In other situations you could have a ultra-slow function because you're executing a heavy function with yield-return multiple times.<p>This is not a problem of yield-return on itself (as SideburnsOfDoom says, it's as easy as calling ToList()), but should remind you that using yield-return everywhere instead of lists is not a good idea.",1348650247

For applications, this means you can have many active web sockets, for instance, where Rails applications tend to break down when you have too many active connections. Phoenix uses erlang processes for these tasks, which are lightweight and can number millions on a single machine.<p>As an example, Heroku uses cowboy (the erlang web server that Phoenix uses) for load-balancing incoming connections to all Heroku applications. The erlang VM (BEAM) is great for these types of highly concurrent, highly available, distributed tasks. The original use case for erlang was highly available phone switching for Ericsson.",1440788389

10137257,comment,10135825,10136820,0,0,yellowapple,,,"A lot of Elixir folks try to claim that the syntax doesn&#x27;t matter.  They&#x27;re lying to themselves: of <i>course</i> the syntax matters.  Not only is it much easier and more consistent for the human brain to parse (even more so than Ruby, in my opinion; unlike Ruby, everything that <i>should</i> take a block - like &#x27;def&#x27; and &#x27;defmodule&#x27; - <i>do</i> (pun intended) take a block), but it also goes above and beyond what Erlang offers with things like its pipe operator (&#x27;|>&#x27;), macro support, defaulting to binary strings (if you use double-quotes; single quotes are Erlang-style lists of characters, which - while they have their uses (aside from the obvious interoperability with Erlang code) - aren&#x27;t really as efficient), and (in my observation) greater consistentcy between what you can do in the REPL (&#x27;iex&#x27;) and what you can do in actual source files.<p>They&#x27;re both great languages, but I think Elixir is a bit more refined, learning from Erlang&#x27;s advantages and disadvantages and improving on them.

If you&#x27;re one the few who have the features disabled on a compatible browser, you make your configuration more unique and it becomes easy to identify you.<p>I&#x27;d would also advice not to spoof the User-Agent since the browser can be detected thanks to other parameters and if those ones contradict the User-Agent that&#x27;s a very specific fingerprint.<p>I&#x27;d also advice not to enable the DNT (Do Not Track) header since it does nothing at all and is used by a minority, so it increases your entropy too.<p>The combination of your three extensions is very fine as far as I can tell. This is what I would advice in addition to them:<p>- Whitelist <i>first-party</i> cookie. Make them be deleted when you close the browser (in the privacy settings of Firefox) and whitelist the few sites you need them to be remembered. To whitelist a site on Firefox, click on the thing at the left of its url on the address bar (either a planet or a lock), click on &#x27;More informations...&#x27;, go to the Permissions tab, scroll to &#x27;Set cookie&#x27;, uncheck &#x27;Use default&#x27; and click the &#x27;Allow&#x27; radio button.<p>Many websites include arbitrary JavaScript that they grabbed in the documentation of some statistic tool or something like that. Such scripts, running directly in the site&#x27;s pages, can then access first-party cookies.<p>- Use something else than Google. If you can&#x27;t deprive yourself of Google results relevance, then use StartPage, it&#x27;s a Google proxy. They make money by displaying non-targeted self-hosted ads. Unfortunately, I fear that Google might be able to identify you thanks to your queries themselves. Otherwise, just use DuckDuckGo.<p>- Use your history and bookmarks. Search engines are for discovering new content. To find something you have already seen or to reach a website you already visited, use your history. Ctrl+Shift+H. Or just type some word you remember in the address bar and pick the correct suggestion.<p>- Use search keywords (<a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/how-search-from-address-bar"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/how-search-from-address...</a>). They allow you to associate a keyword to about any search form anywhere and then search this form directly in the address bar. This also will reduce your search engine usage.<p>You should also know that when your browser performs a third-party request, the recipient of the request can know the page you&#x27;re coming from thanks to the HTTP referer header. It can be disabled in about:config (<a href=""http://www.technipages.com/firefox-enable-disable-referrer"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.technipages.com/firefox-enable-disable-referrer</a>), but I&#x27;m not sure it would be a good idea, first because of what I&#x27;ve said about fingerprints in the beginning, second because it might break some websites.",1440787840

For example, those people will use phrases like &quot;I&#x27;ve mainly asked questions&quot; as a distraction tactic, because for very little effort - a single line of text - it&#x27;s possible to &#x27;escape the burden of proof behind extraordinary claims&#x27; (quoting RationalWiki) or get people to spend time on writing a response which is then ignored. I&#x27;m glad I had this opportunity to highlight an unfortunate aspect of your autodidact learning style, and hope it might help in the future.<p>I did not address your points because you wanted to switch the conversation to another topic without resolving any of the earlier topics. I feel no need to let you be in charge of steering the conversation to only those things you want to bring up, when I feel you have ignored my earlier points. Rhetorically, why should I spend more time on the new topic with the expectation that it will also be ignored?<p>I notice the use of the phrase &#x27;&quot;I posted links, why can&#x27;t you read them&quot; strawman&#x27;. I have not heard of a logical fallacy based on not reading primary or secondary references. My suggestion was and is that you should ask the questions which remain after reading those materials, instead of insisting that people like me do your research for you. That is not a fallacy. It is a suggestion of how you might make better use of the limited time and patience of others.<p>Since you wish to use those PPP tables, perhaps you can explain why Belarus stands at 4,520.37 and Indonesia at 3,939.56. Using your interpretation, that means it costs $3,939.56 to buy the same unit of goods and services in Indonesia as it does in the US? Indonesia is a very expensive country. (Hint: it does not require a home loan for most US citizens to spend two weeks on vacation in Denmark or Indonesia.)<p>If you instead look at <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purchasing_power_parity"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purchasing_power_parity</a> you would see Denmark as only being about 20% more expensive than the US. That same page shows that a Big Mac in Denmark cost $5.37 in 2012. While more expensive than the US, it&#x27;s hardly the 7x that you suggest. I suggest therefore that you have misunderstood the underlying economics.<p>Indeed, your first link says &quot;A purchasing power parity (PPP) between two countries, A and B, is the ratio of the number of units of country A’s currency needed to purchase in country A the same quantity of a specific good or service as one unit of country B’s currency will purchase in country B.&quot; In Denmark it costs 7.6 DKK to purchase what in the US would cost 1 USD. As the current exchange rate is 1US = 6.68 DKK, this means the Denmark is 14% more expensive than the US, in rough agreement with the Wikipedia page on PPP.<p>I&#x27;m glad I could help clear up your understanding how how to interpret those tables.<p>&quot;To me, this is &quot;once removed&quot; relationship. What else can it be, and why else would they do it other than to expose the contracting/franchising corporate entity to unionization?&quot;<p>The decision makes clear what is meant by &#x27;joint-employer&#x27;, which is a concept which has long been part of US labor law:<p>> the Board typically treated the right to control the work of employees and their terms of em- ployment as probative of joint-employer status. The Board did not require that this right be exercised, or that it be exercised in any particular manner. Thus, the Board’s joint-employer decisions found it probative that employers retained the contractual power to reject or terminate workers;22 set wage rates;23 set working hours;24 approve overtime;25 dictate the number of work- ers to be supplied;26 determine “the manner and method of work performance”;27 “inspect and approve work,”28 and terminate the contractual agreement itself at will.29 The Board stressed that “the power to control is present by virtue of the operating agreement.”30 Reviewing courts expressly endorsed this approach.31 ...<p>etc. There is no need for me to give my personal views of &quot;what else can it be&quot; when you can read the actual reasoning yourself. My interpretation is that your analysis only considers contract law - hence, &#x27;once-removed&#x27; - and leaving out the common-law definition of the employment relationship - hence, &#x27;joint-employer&#x27;. It is possible to be both once-removed and a joint-employer.<p>You may of course hold your personal views on the topic, but the issue at hand is the interpretation of the National Labor Relations Act, which is the US law that among other things, yes, &#x27;guarantees basic rights of private sector employees to organize into trade unions.&#x27; It&#x27;s almost as if I had the ideology that people should be able to exercise their legal right to unionize!",1440787633

It&#x27;s a real challenge, but you can make use of the fact that the ball bounces off the top of the screen and comes back if it goes straight up enough.  In that scenario, I&#x27;d immediately draw a vertical line down the right edge of the screen (that&#x27;s where the ball is about to head, then I&#x27;d get ready to draw a horizontal line across the top right as soon as the ball falls in that area.  That&#x27;ll trap it, causing it to eventually go down the lower right drain.  While you&#x27;re waiting for that, draw lines that corral it from there over to the square.<p>I think this is an excellent game and would probably keep playing a version that had some of the bugs worked out.  The glitching through walls can be fairly infuriating if you have the ball completely enclosed and it gets its way out, plus the interactions with the edges of the screen can really screw you up (e.g. when you&#x27;re drawing a line and you accidentally brush against the edge, so it drops the line immediately).  I&#x27;d also get rid of the clickable stuff at the top left or reduce the play area so that stuff isn&#x27;t in the way, since a couple of times I accidentally surrendered while I was trying to draw a line there.<p>One other improvement I could think of is doing a little forward calculation on your randomly-chosen initial state to prevent it from setting up scenarios that really are impossible or just no fun.  Having the ball appear for a 10th of a second and then bounce off the top of the screen never to be seen again (because it went to the side) is no fun.  Oh, and maybe stick a red dot or something at the top border of the screen when the ball is up there so you can track where it is horizontally.

These changes can be characterized by two main, distinct components: (i) the decline in premature mortality, i.e., the concentration of deaths around some high value of the mean age at death, also termed rectangularization of the survival curve; and (ii) the increase of this mean age at death, i.e., longevity, which directly reflects the reduction of mortality at advanced ages. Several recent observations suggest that both mechanisms are simultaneously taking place.<p>Methods<p>We propose a set of indicators aiming to quantify, disentangle, and compare the respective contribution of rectangularization and longevity increase to the secular increase of life expectancy. These indicators, based on a nonparametric approach, are easy to implement.<p>Results<p>We illustrate the method with the evolution of the Swiss mortality data between 1876 and 2006.

They start innocently enough as a relationship with a coworker or platonic friend that they start to feel a connection with, start developing feelings,  and it snowballs from there. Based on that pattern, I doubt many women go &quot;I want to have an affair&quot; and just go do it so the dedicated website model is probably not where online affairs start for women. Probably more likely FB  reconnecting with an old flame or talking with someone at a point where they at least convinced themselves it was innocent at first.",1440785384

And yes, my details are in the leak. Me and my wife grew up and married within the mormon church, complete with its absolutely distorted view of human sexuality. After leaving mormonism, we came to realize our sexual maturity had been stunted and wanted to experience new things...we now have a somewhat open marriage. We set a few ground rules because we do love each other and didn&#x27;t want to break up, but then we set out on our quests to find other partners.<p>I tried the tinder thing, and that was okay. I tried just going to bars, and that was okay. I came away feeling a little skeezy, despite being completely honest with my wife, because I had to be dishonest with the girls I was meeting...nobody in those situations responds well to &quot;Oh, by the way, I&#x27;m married&quot;, no matter how clear you are about it being okay with your wife. I also grew tired of hookups and one night stands very quickly. I wanted to meet women that occasionally wanted to meet up, but were okay with the fact that I had a family life and couldn&#x27;t just run away any time either of us wanted some. Tinder and bars were definitely the wrong target market.<p>While I was doing this, my wife skipped straight to Ashley Madison. Put up a few pictures, and within seconds she was getting more messages than she could read. Like literally 500+ messages a day. She tried to filter them by stating explicitly on her profile what she was <i>not</i> interested in (specifically, out of shape or over 45yo). It didn&#x27;t stop them. Most of the messages could be described as follows: Shrivelled or obese old men (my wife is 29 btw) well over 45 (including several senior citizens), accompanied by unsolicited dick pics, and messages about how they could last all night long or whatever. Some men were a lot closer to what she was looking for, but after filtering out all the garbage she didn&#x27;t feel up to the task of trying to message back. She decided to ignore the messages and try messaging men herself. They either didn&#x27;t respond, or they messaged back asking if she was a fake profile. She eventually was successful in finding what she wanted, but it was pretty significant effort.<p>I grew frustrated with the expectations of tinder and bars, and reluctantly decided to try AM. After seeing my wife&#x27;s experience, I knew I was in for a sausage fest competition, but I also learned quickly what was a turnoff to women and I am pretty attractive myself, so I thought I had a chance. My perspective from the guy&#x27;s side? For the most part, it is an extremely expensive scam. A single message will cost you $1-2 depending on the points package you bought (women don&#x27;t pay for anything). If you want a priority message, it costs double that. All you get with a priority message is a guarantee that your message will not be buried in the 500+ message/day inbox of the woman you are trying to message. It can still get buried, but it only gets buried under other priority messages. I had 20+ messages a day from other women (or, more accurately, profiles of women). It was very obvious that most of them were fake, so I didn&#x27;t bother with the obvious ones. Some of them were less obvious fakes. Some of them were scams to get you to sign up for other sites, or paid &quot;background checks&quot; from women who &quot;just want to be safe&quot;. And occasionally, I got messages from actual women, but I never was interested in them.<p>I did have some success with talking to and meeting actual women. Based on my experience, I would estimate that 1000 is a pretty low estimate for the total number of active women on the site. I would probably ballpark 100-200 in my metro area, at least between 20-40yo. And here&#x27;s another surprise...about half of them were single. In fact, all of the women I ended up meeting in person were single. But yes, it was quite obvious that the vast majority were completely fake.<p>I actually feel like I enjoyed my AM experience, but can totally understand why you wouldn&#x27;t if you aren&#x27;t comparatively young and attractive. For them, I guess you could blame it on AM being a scam site as much as you could blame it on having inflated expectations of what you could get out of it. I mean, if you are 50+, overweight, and have no clue how to talk to women, of course you aren&#x27;t going to land a date with a 20yo hotbody. And yet it happened...thousands of men threw away their money in an attempt to hook up with my wife. I&#x27;d estimate AM made at least $5000 from my wife alone, in the two months she was active on it.<p>And then there is the leak problem. I wasn&#x27;t worried about my wife finding out, and I&#x27;m not worried about divorce...but I am worried about my extended family finding my email address, because they are all super judgmental mormons (albeit with naive kind hearts). I have had to come up with a cover story with my wife if they approached her about it. My life won&#x27;t end if they find out...it just will just become a lot more tense with my extended family. I also now have to worry about moral crusaders in background checks and other situations...I get the opportunity to tell people my situation is different while they smile, nod, and judge me as a sleazy cheater. That sucks. Add to that the fact that we couldn&#x27;t delete our profiles without paying a ransom, and it totally sucks. And while the majority of the active users were likely men trying to cheat on their wives, there were tons of people just like me, as well as other situations (including single people, homosexuals, polyamorous, etc.) where they weren&#x27;t cheating but they did want something direct and discrete.<p>TL;DR: Not a complete scam, just mostly. The site really was mostly a bunch of desperate men talking to bots and getting ignored by women, and paying out the nose for the privilege. And Avid Life Media is a pile of shit company that deserves their inevitable bankruptcy. Their executive team is both nefarious and negligent and should be burned at the metaphorical stake. I hope they shut down the company before the picture data gets released.<p>And maybe have some empathy for the users that got caught up in the leak, because all you have is proof that they signed up for a website, but you don&#x27;t have any clue as to their situation nor intentions.",1440785336

The real game-changer to me about Elixir vs Erlang is its macro system.  This gives you runtime code execution and runtime code generation, similar to what makes LISP to powerful.<p>There&#x27;s a large amount of boilerplate involved in creating an OTP server, as you know if you&#x27;ve done any Erlang.  Elixir&#x27;s macro capabilities completely eliminate all the boilerplate.<p>The source to both Elixir and Phoenix are quite elegant and educational to browse, and demonstrate this runtime code generation aspect very well. It&#x27;s straightforward in Elixir to introspect code, represent that code as data structures, manipulate those data structures, then generate or execute that code, as you can in LISP.<p>Elixir also gives a number of excellent tools that streamline the support process over vanilla Erlang.  For example, Elixir&#x27;s runtime tooling automatically manages dependencies for you (similar to node&#x27;s npm), and automatically maintains the application string that you need to provide for all OTP applications.  It also has improved capabilities for testing, which are also made possible by the amazing macro generation capabilities.<p>> I&#x27;m looking into using Erlang for a new project that requires extensive scaling and concurrency and am coming from a functional background so may be more comfortable with the traditional Erlang syntax<p>Elixir&#x27;s syntax is still just as functional.  They support a regular if statement, unlike Erlang, but generally it&#x27;s just as functional as Erlang.  Elixir eliminates a number of needless chores from Erlang, such as having to end some lines of code with a comma, and others with a period, and then shuffling punctuation around whenever you add or remove lines of code.  That&#x27;s a task I used to do literally a hundred times a day in Erlang that I don&#x27;t have to do at all any more.",1440785141

A preliminary injunction is an extraordinary remedy issued <i>before</i> a case is heard and decided, in order to prevent ongoing harm during the course of the case. When there is no likelihood of irreparable harm, courts are not supposed to issue a preliminary injunction before hearing the case.

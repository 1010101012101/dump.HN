Online ads are still in their infancy. Ads are often clumsily placed on content sites using keyword matching that can misfire or even backfire (ads for airline tickets in a story about a crash).<p>To make matters worse, all content seems to covered with a slimy film - the sorts of ads that normally appear on late night TV seem to show up on the best of sites.<p>Believe it or not, there are people who enjoy well executed television or print ads, either for their entertainment value or for their effectiveness.  I haven't heard the same for online ads, with possibly the recent exception of the ""Old Spice Man Who Your Man Could Smell Like.""<p>There's a lot of room here for improvement not only of the ads, but for the online experience overall.  While Google and others are milking the contextual cow, some bright minds are going to come up with something revolutionary that will change how publishers monetize their sites.  Ads will fit better, be more engaging and monetize sites and drive results for their buyers.<p>Perhaps then those ads for diet pills, get-rich-quick schemes and their ilk will be banished to the gutters of the internet where they belong.",1280501823

It was the music of somebody else's youth,  which makes it all the more dangerous and seductive.  It appeals to geezers who were listening to it when it was new,  and it still appeals to new generations of young people.<p>Classic rock dominates the airwaves in my locale;  other than NPR,  I find everything else unlistenable [there was ~one~ good urban music station a long time ago,  but it's owned by Clear Channel and quit playing anything good rather abruptly after 9/11]<p>The situation has many dimensions (for instance,  any credible 'new' rock has to make a rapprochement with punk) but the thing I hate the most is hearing the same doobie brothers song on the radio driving into work and driving home.

If it's a chore to you and has no practical application, don't waste your time, play something you like. The only reason I know a few minor and major scales is because I like to improvise. When it comes time to solo, I know what to play because I know what notes are in the scale. If I didn't know any scales, I'd be lost. It also make a lot more sense if you practice with some backing track/chords cause then you can figure out what sounds good. This also applies to playing piano, lets say I want to play some minor sounding progression, I'd most likely play A minor because all the white keys are in the A minor scale which makes it easy to create a melody.",1280501353

Some people love the ""I don't have to think about it""-ness of garbage collection, others hate the ""I don't know when this destructor will be called"" effect.  Yes, I know these are not exactly opposites, and that different languages have semantics and pragmatics that vary from a little to a lot.<p>So here, let me ask: What <i>must</i> a language do and have?<p>For you, for your programming style and purpose, must a language have GC?  Must it have strings?  Must it be able to take a list of any type and act on it?<p>In Python you can define the ""length"" function like this:<p><pre><code>    length = lambda L: sum(map(lambda x:1,L))
</code></pre>
or like this:<p><pre><code>    def length(L):
        if L==[]: return 0
        return 1+length(L[1:])
</code></pre>
and you don't have to worry about the types held in L.  Does that matter to you?<p>What really matters?  When I get enough answers, if I get enough answers, I might turn this into a poll.",1280499881

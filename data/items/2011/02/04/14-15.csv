2179597,comment,2178339,2179409,0,0,draz,,,"Fair questions.\nA bit of a background first. My co-founders were: an MBA student with a healthcare concentration (Wharton), an MD/PhD student (Columbia), and me, the techie (grad student Columbia). Unfortunately for the start-up (and fortunately for my co-founders), they graduated and moved to Denver (to work at a healthcare company) and San-Francisco (residency), respectively. Although I wanted to continue working on things, with 66% of the founding team away and unwilling to commit to putting in the time, the project is bound to fail. Now, one may argue that I should have continued on my own, which is a fair point to make. However, what I've learned about healthcare is that it's a VERY tough market. It is not because of there exists some crazy technological challenge that the tech world has never seen before, rather because of the people in the industry and the industry's regulations. Physicians and institutions are VERY suspicious of anyone even remotely trying to enter their ""domain,"" and they would thwart any attempt.  Our intention was to help them with their workflow, so they could see more patients and thus make more money. When you approach MDs, for the most part, they fear that you may try to replace them (although that was not our intention).  It follows with immediate resistance. Also, if you were to get into this domain, you should know that you can't just put up a website in 4 hours and start testing (Snowcolypse!! :-) ). Medicine is so ""academic"" that people want to run clinical trials, etc.  In short, there's a lot of bureaucracy.\nInterestingly, I now lead the implementation of the clinical data warehouse at a major medical institution in the US (though I was always a programmer, not a DB or BI guy. Sortta fell into this position).  The other week I spoke to the director of the stroke center at a medical institute in Brooklyn NY. A 50-something year old guy, one of the only 1200 stroke experts in the US.  Super nice guy, super smart (taught himself python and Fortran to have a common language with the technies and to know when they're trying to pull his leg).  He's very much into technology and its applications within medicine (he's trying to push telemedicine to strokes, because every second counts).  As he put it, ""the problem with healthcare is that the stakeholders think that this is the most complicated domain in the world. People are so arrogant to think nobody has tackled these technological problems before.""  They, therefore, push off any suggestion for improvement (what worked for Pfizer, BMW, or Goldman Sachs, who have millions of transactions a second, will not work for us!)  Same sentiment exists at my current employer.",1296831597

2179591,comment,2179081,2179081,0,0,Nitramp,,,"I think there is huge value in trying to become what has been called a ""full stack programmer"". In the maning of: try to understand how computer systems work by understanding how each part of the stack works. Don't try to completely understand every subtle detail of every part - try to understand it like you understand how a combustion engine works.<p>My list would be:<p><pre><code>  - basic electronic concepts, ie. transistors, XOR / NAND, bit shifters, adders\n  - assembly language\n  - hardware layout: CPU, registers, main memory, MMU, interrupts\n  - operating systems: hardware interface, multi processing, file systems\n  - networking: packet networks, ethernet, TCP/IP (sliding window, congestion control)\n  - low level programming: C with fopen & co, sockets, structs, system calls\n  - compiler construction (this is important!), parsers, translators, programming language implementation and virtual machines\n  - algorithms: complexity theory, automata, CFGs, common data structures (heaps, maps, trees)\n  - discrete mathematics, statistics\n</code></pre>\nI think if you can explain all of these in at least a sort-of, hand wavy way, then you're on a good path to become an excellent programmer. I also think that is what a good CS degree should teach you. Try to explain to yourself in a children's story way what actually happens when you click your mouse button.

2179589,comment,2179268,2179268,0,0,greenmachine,,,"As someone currently living in Ireland, I found the subtitle of this article particularly appropriate: ""Where's the rage?"". The Irish government bankrupted the country many times over by putting the debts of the banks on the backs of the people. But, unlike France, for example, where people have taken to the streets and brought the country to a halt to be heard, in Ireland there is nothing like the level of activism that one would expect given the depth of the economic quagmire.<p>I find it quite sad to see how a country that was once such a hotbed of political unrest has become so passified by the recent wealth that it experienced. My guess is it has to do with people having the feeling that they are stakeholders in the system now, with mortgages and fungible assets, and so they are less willing to want to subvert the system itself rather than muddle along even with unsatisfactory political solutions.",1296831483

It turned out he doesn't really like to program, he's not a programmer. The way this materialized was when given an assignment, he wasn't willing to proactively figure out how to solve it. We either told him in great detail how to solve it or he'd throw up his arms.<p>This happened in 9 out of 10 cases, whether it was a really small (1 hour) or a larger (multi-month) assignment.

I came to my first job not knowing a lick of programming, and the job didn't require it anyway.  I got into programming because we were trying to do a website redesign and I wanted to help out.  After we finished up that project, I kept going at because I liked it.<p>The first 9-12 months were tough.  I read some beginner's books, wrote lots of really ugly code, and got things to work eventually, if only barely.<p>Then the code started to get prettier and more robust, and I picked up some more theoretical books like Leiserson's Intro to Algorithms to learn the theory.  Having ""pulled"" around code for 9-12 months on my own, learning more formal computer science really allowed me to begin gluing those pieces together.<p>Everyone learns differently.  Maybe a better approach for some CS programs would be to throw students into the water for their first year, let them struggle reinventing the wheel and solving practical problems as best they can, and then teach the theory and formalisms later?",1296831190

2179563,comment,2179254,2179254,0,0,_delirium,,,"HN is useful for this too. My particular niche is that I'm an academic researcher, but I think there's a bunch of stuff that's poorly presented in academic papers, or at least only presented in a way that's intended to be read by other people in the same field (or sub-field, or sub-sub-field). So one of my medium-term plans is to re-present some of the stuff I like in a less jargony and formal way, in tutorials / blog posts / whatever. But often that gets pushed off behind other obligations, and it feels like Work, even if it's work that I enjoy. But posting an explanation of something I know about that comes up in a discussion on HN just feels like conversation, much more natural. It's not always as polished as a result, but sometimes I've actually used my HN comments as a first-draft of a longer tutorial.<p>For example (for a bit of self-promotion), this recent comment possibly could've been a better-written and better-edited blog post, with some images and examples, and a title like ""implicit and explicit models in interactive fiction"", or I dunno, something like that but catchier: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2177226"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2177226</a>. But writing something like that would probably sit on the TODO list for a long time; meanwhile I just banged out that comment in 20 minutes or so because it came up in discussion. The fact that it was ""replying to a comment"" rather than ""writing a thing"" somehow tricked it into not feeling like writing. Now if I ever want to write a blog post, I have a draft of the idea written out.",1296830898

They have never had issues with nude photos, bullying, and so on.  It does not have to be some huge issue.  It can be, but it doesn't have to be.<p>I will note that my kids were homeschooled and the bullying described in the article apparently revolved around this girl's real life social circle from school -- someone she went on an actual date with who spread rumors as a form of vengeance when she didn't put out.  On homeschooling lists, there is fairly often discussion about how schools have a ""lord of the flies"" social dynamic.  From my perspective, the incident in question is rooted in that issue, not in the internet per se.<p>I will also note that the photos in the article, which are described as re-creations of actual photos found online, all show what look to me like very upscale bedrooms that are a cluttered disaster.  The settings suggest to me a home where the parents value material things overly much and try to ""dote"" on their kids by showering them with money and things in place of time and attention. I never had the kind of matching decor and such shown in the photos.  But I did grow up with a garden out back, home-cooked meals, and parents helping me with my homework. And my bedroom never looked like the cluttered disaster depicted consistently throughout the photos.  My room got cleaned and picked up.<p>My sons and I laugh at the idea of them being able to get away with some of the stunts we hear about or get into trouble without me knowing.  First of all, I was there so much that I would have known what they were up to -- they couldn't have disappeared for hours on end without an explanation and no one noticing.

It's fundamentally a bad practice because if someone gets ahold of a database table containing your names and passwords, you immediately have to change them all.  You're broken, wide open.\n2) storing passwords encryption, where the necessary apps have the keys, but the DB itself only has encrypted data.   now if someone steals your DB, your passwords are relatively safe, unless someone ALSO managed to break into the right production app server and extract the key.    This is acceptable for storing credit card numbers for PCI compliance... should be good enough for your website. \nIf the DB is breached, you are still going to through a password changing exercise, but you have time to do it without going into panic mode.<p>3) Hashed passwords + salt.  It's worked well in unix for years.  It's fine for web apps where you don't want to be able to recover a password, only reset it.  Note the salt is really important here... it lives in your app, not in your DB.

Should college teach you to program?<p>This is a philosophical question about whether a CS degree should be <i>educational</i> or <i>vocational</i>. The general consensus seems to be that it should be the former not the latter. It should give you the theoretical foundation that you can apply to almost anything.<p>Therefore, college won't necessarily teach you any programming beyond what you need to read examples and do assignments, which may not be particularly deep.<p>2. Do you like to program?<p>Frankly, every good programmer I know started programming long before they went to college or at least programmed outside of college for their enjoyment.<p>If you haven't done that and don't do that then I really have to question if you're in the right profession.<p>3. Programming vs Being a Programmer.<p>Being a programmer as a job for which you are paid is different to programming. It involves many other skills such as design, reviews, dealing with people, writing documentation, supporting applications and so on. This is not something taught in school (nor could it be really).<p>I view the first 2-3 years of your work life as an apprenticeship of sorts. You've got the basic theory, now you have to go out into the real world and make yourself useful to somebody.<p>Many companies have graduate programs and the like. I think it's fairly important to start off somewhere that's good, meaning they'll teach you something (rather than simply crushing you, which, sadly, is more the norm).<p>If you can put in 2-3 years at, say, Google, Facebook or Apple after doing a good CS course, you'll have gotten yourself off to a very good start.",1296829397

They still would have needed to use blowfish/bcrypt (afaik), but your high rounds are useless if an attacker gets the actual data out of your infrastructure, just like they are with normaler hashes.<p>Second, the Gawker guys had no salting, and they used DES, which, as you know, was deprecated before many HN users were born. This made cracking the passwords really easy ... not that it would be that much harder with a conventional salting mechanism or even with bcrypt.<p>I was not contending that bcrypt is not like really great, just that it's not ""completely irresponsible"" to not use bcrypt or scrypt. bcrypt is <i>still</i> vulnerable to dictionary attacks, the only difference is the amount of time it will take to get everyone's password out, which, again, is useless in a case like gawker where the dumps are distributed all over the internet for anyone with an interest to peruse.<p>Please correct me if I'm wrong.",1296829119

I've been thinking about the Harry Potter thing of how they get to the train station for wizarding school by running straight at the brick wall with confidence, which carries them through it and to a different world, where a train awaits to whisk them off to a magical place, a place to learn yet more magic.  I think it's a great metaphor.  The brick walls aren't really there.  Just go at them head on, believing they aren't really there.<p>Oh, and there's no spoon either.<p>Best of luck.",1296828278

The vast majority of founders I know are a) busy working their nuts off and b) pretty bitter, due to the UK attitude to entrepreneurs (urgh, why would you do that? Starting your own business is <i>stupid</i>).<p>I guess what I'm getting at is that entrepreneurs in the US and the UK are pretty different - in the US, they rely on a support network of other entrepreneurs, and are part of a community. In the UK, you're on your own, definitively, and entrepreneurs shy away from potential support networks because they're so used to any large group of people being overwhelmingly comprised of naysayers.<p>Oh, and finally, London isn't the entire UK.

It worked great.<p>But at some point, I picked up a book because of a recommendation and it was astonishingly good (Cocoa Programming on OSX, Hillegaas). It gave me a real sense of confidence and overview that I was lacking in all my pull-learned topics. I guess this is because pull only ever provides very localized knowledge but you rarely see the big picture.<p>Since then, I tend to push-learn at first to get a feeling and overview over a language or framework and then gradually switch over to a more pull-oriented approach. This has served me very well. Some books out there are real marvels that can get you started with a new technology very painlessly. Gathering all that knowledge would take a lot longer. Yet, there is nothing as instructive as getting your own hands wet.",1296828231

Hash based challenge-response authentication <i>does</i> require the server to know the plain password.<p>This sort of authentication is useful when you don't trust your transport mechanism (i.e. logging in over HTTP) but do trust the server's security. There are other ways to achieve this though. You could use DH or a similar key exchange method to decide a secret key (DH can do this without letting eavesdroppers know the key) to encode the password with for transport. You are then avoiding both plain transport and plain storage, where hashed storage on its own requires plain transport (unless the transport mechanism is separately encrypted, by SSL/TLS in the case of HTTPS) and hashed challenge/response requires plain storage.<p>Securing the transport (by using HTTPS with a signed-by-a-generally-trusted0body certificate, rather than HTTP or HTTPS with a self-signed cert) is the better option for a web based application though.<p>Of course, a site like PoF is not going to use any of the above.

Ive found that i am this way.  I have alot of ideas that im passionate about developing.  So ive learned how to manage and organize them.  Ive also learned to try to find people that are like minded.  Which can take some trial and error.  The one important thing is to not doubt yourself about this.  Be trully passionate about your ideas and about developing them.  People will see this and respect it and want to get involved.  Also really develop skills around your ideas.  Be it a strong business sense or a strong technical sense or a strong understanding of the market youre in.  This will give you a stronger leg up and the ability to deal with multiple projects.<p>If you actually want to chat more about this and talk about your ideas send me an email.

What we learn in college is mostly how to learn and how to problem solve.  The problems we solve in college, whether stumbling through our first sorting algorithms or writing a paper about the role of Prussian nationalism in the 1800s, are not tied at all to the problems we have to solve professionally.  And that's okay.\nWhen it comes to being a practitioner, whether producing commercial software products or writing analyst reports on public companies, the job itself is the best training.  What you have to bring to the table is the curiousity and ability to learn and problem solve that get you up the learning curve quickly, and the professionalism that makes you a reliable and welcome colleague.",1296828021

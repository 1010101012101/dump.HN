Atleast one of them needs to succeed or you'll go bankrupt(or something). Now, most people will probably think that if they divide their attention between both projects, they have a higher chance of bringing in some money. The thinking here is ""Even if A doesn't take off, B might still bring in some money"". So, B is the cushion against failure of A (or vice-versa). But this plan lacks focus - You cannot fully focus on A or B. Removing either improves focus but it also removes the cushion.<p>That's what he means by getting ""scared"".",1339577991

This sort of thing only comes up because we have given a corporation the power to revoke access to software.  In iOS there is no opportunity to install 'unsigned' software.<p>This situation also makes RMS's claims much more reasonable.  Since this is not open software, it takes away the ability to ensure proper functioning of it upon some arbitrary future iOS update.  If this were open software running on an open OS, any corporation, misguided or oppressive government, or judge would find it impossible to deprive people of the use of it, in perpetuity.<p>The two things that I'll be doing in response to this:<p>- selling my devices that use iOS.  I've always felt uncomfortable giving up control, and I am starting to think it is morally iffy to contribute to a system that allows things like Maya being removed from the Appstore.  Voluntarily giving rights, by using a system that requires giving a corporation the power to whitelist <i>all</i> software, seems short sighted, and this story brings it into sharp contrast.  Luckily I won't have to return to the dark ages, I can just switch to Android (which is a GPL system that allows me to find alternate sources of software, and use unsigned software if I want).<p>- not buy the new retina macbook pro.  I think I will become even more of a curmudgeon and   just use Linux.  I've been using Linux for around 5 years, but I almost always have a Macbook Pro as well, because Linux has rough edges.  This sort of story reminds me that the more I am reliant on non-open software, the more I give the power to other people.  If TextMate stops updating (oh, wait), or OSX goes the way of previous non-Jobs Apple products and becomes an untenable product, the more uncomfortable it will be for me.  Since I make my living as a programmer, if I lose access to the tools I use, or they become crap, it is a serious concern to me.  Perhaps Linux has some rough edges, but I can rely on it being there as long as it is useful for it to be there.  I know Emacs will be available to me.",1339577818

On one hand you have an App Store where an infinite number of copies of an application can be legally obtained even when it'd be impractical or impossible to make physical copies. This enables individuals to produce apps used by millions. How many people were able to pull of what the founders of Sierra and Elecronic Arts did back when they had to hand-copy floppies and find distribution in sparsely scattered retail stores? Then it was exceptional. Today it's almost routine.<p>On the down-side you have the rather transient nature of the platform where bit-rot happens much faster. Theoretically you can keep your iPad in its frozen state in perpetuity, backed up and re-imaged onto a replacement device if necessary. If you start upgrading, the half-life of applications kicks in and you're going to start losing some of them over time.<p>It's not clear which is better in the end.<p>The solution to this software problem could be to make an open-source version or one that side-steps the patents, whatever those are, as cleverly as possible.

The major difference with macros is that they're repeatable, while multiple cursors do the same thing at once, and once.<p>Also, when one vim user uses f/t too often, one should look into an object describing what he wants to really do (here [0]).<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2699"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2699</a><p>I hope Sublime Text has or introduces at some point the same extendable concept of text objects as in vim.<p>Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying anything of this is bad per se, just that there's room for improvement.",1339576569

I know nothing about music but it seems your analysis also needs to include information about timing (A is followed by B within X ms, C within Y ms, etc.) and some sort of clustering information that would allow choruses to be produced (e.g. identify clusters + cluster timing then information about the chords within the clusters).<p>Even better would be if you guys released your data and allowed other people to come up with creative ways of analyzing and using it ;)  I actually have an idea that I think could work quite well and I'd love to build it but lack the data.",1339574896

We are making $100T decisions on the basis of $1M papers and closed datasets.<p>Regarding retraction, I think this is pretty unambiguous<p><a href=""http://climateaudit.org/2012/06/08/gergis-et-al-put-on-hold/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://climateaudit.org/2012/06/08/gergis-et-al-put-on-hold/</a><p><pre><code>  Dear Stephen,\n\n  I am contacting you on behalf of all the authors of the \n  Gergis et al (2012) study Evidence of unusual late 20th \n  century warming from an Australasian temperature \n  reconstruction spanning the last millennium\n\n  An issue has been identified in the processing of the data \n  used in the study, which may affect the results. While the \n  paper states that both proxy climate and instrumental data \n  were linearly detrended over the 19211990 period, we \n  discovered on Tuesday 5 June that the records used in the \n  final analysis were not detrended for proxy selection, \n  making this statement incorrect. Although this is an \n  unfortunate data processing issue, it is likely to have \n  implications for the results reported in the study. The \n  journal has been contacted and the publication of the study \n  has been put on hold.\n\n  This is a normal part of science. The testing of scientific \n  studies through independent analysis of data and methods \n  strengthens the conclusions. In this study, an issue has \n  been identified and the results are being re-checked.\n\n  We would be grateful if you would post the notice below on \n  your ClimateAudit web site.\n\n  We would like to thank you and the participants at the \n  ClimateAudit blog for your scrutiny of our study, which \n  also identified this data processing issue.\n\n  Thanks, David Karoly\n\n  Print publication of scientific study put on hold\n\n  An issue has been identified in the processing of the data \n  used in the study, Evidence of unusual late 20th century \n  warming from an Australasian temperature reconstruction \n  spanning the last millennium by Joelle Gergis, Raphael \n  Neukom, Stephen Phipps, Ailie Gallant and David Karoly, \n  accepted for publication in the Journal of Climate.\n  We are currently reviewing the data and results.\n</code></pre>\nNow, props to Karoly for being gracious in this takedown. Part of the problem is that a scientific paper is like a monolithic binary where a bugfix means going out and recalling every copy of the software out in the field.<p>So paper authors usually are very resistant to bugfixes, as they are career ending.In this case Karoly severely damaged Gergis' career and may have hurt his own. From a purely self-interested perspective he should have just stonewalled the ""denialists"" like Michael Mann has. But he was honest as a scientist.<p>Much better to move towards an open source culture where a ""paper"" is just the documentation for a major version number associated with a data/code repository.",1339574642

Additionally, if using where clauses, strip the input of all apostrophes or double quotes. I don't think there would be anything left to exploit if everybody were to adopt this semi-paranoid approach to protecting your code from bad input.",1339574624

People like John Allspaw of Etsy (previously Flickr) have been improving on how operations is handled by treating configuration as code and automating everything they can.<p>It is interesting to think through what this could mean to other areas (to me at least). Ie what would it mean to be a Sales Hacker, a Customer Support Hacker or even be a Middle Management Hacker. Possibly some of this will turn out to be meaningless but the success of the DevOps movement suggests to me there could be something to at least some of these ideas. Possibly the 'learn to code' movement will result in more cross overs in other domains, who knows.",1339574600

Their ""theory"" is nothing more substantive than New Age mysticism. They talk about states, state shifts, and forcings but do not fully describe any of them except at the most superficial levels. They put forward no tests (quantitative or qualitative) to determine the boundaries of a state or to test whether a ""state shift"" has occurred. That is a flaw at the very lowest level of their ""theory"". On top of that they build many fanciful constructs which have even less basis in the scientific method.<p>I've commented on this before, but it bears repeating.

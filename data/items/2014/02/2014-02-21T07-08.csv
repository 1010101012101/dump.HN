I read a great quote somewhere - &#x27;nobody becomes a leader without doing questionable things&#x27;. I firmly believe it to be true for Gandhi and MLK and Jesus, but that doesn&#x27;t steal away the fact that he was indeed a great leader of Indians and the whole world looked up to him for non-violence.<p>Regarding him being a wife-beater, I want to know your sources. I know for a fact that RSS propagates a lot of lies about Gandhi and Nehru family. I firmly believe he practiced non-violence and was NOT a wife-beater, WAS against caste-system, WAS against British rule over India. His secrets that are coming to light now (such as his sexual deviations) are things that were public when he was alive but almost nobody cared, or cared enough to propagate. Today, his legacy is major political problem for India and so it is being dug-up by some, while others want to hide it.<p>Whether he was responsible of India&#x27;s independence or not, I don&#x27;t know if it can be debated after 70 years of the fact. And I don&#x27;t think one will ever get to the &#x27;facts&#x27; by debating on this point.

I use the concept of distribution in the sense of separating a process within different entities (search router and local searches).<p>In the distributed case the &quot;search router&quot; queries other sites to determine the best results. For example, searching for code samples involved querying Stack Overflow, Code Project, Forums, etc. This approach is clearly expensive: you rely on the other sites speed, web service availability, etc.<p>The non distributed approach is just receiving their algorithms and data and processing everything in the router search engine. Obviously this solution can be implemented in a distributed way inside the search engine but it is not distributed in the sense of distributing the process within different entities.<p>In the two cases you are distributing efforts, one of the key  goals of this approach because it is really difficult to compete with Google. Google &quot;knows&quot; how to give good results in diverse areas while in the proposed attack vector you rely on others for part of this optimization. A movie site should know how to give good results about movies while a site related to books knows about books.<p>It&#x27;s important to note that the vast majority of search results ends in relatively few sites, so if the top visited sites implement this approach Google search market share can be challenged. Obviously we don&#x27;t really know if this approach will work in practice until we see it.",1392968544

If it produced any output, you&#x27;ll see that too. Most of them are no-ops for small project anyway.<p>For example: the build output will have &quot;dh_configure&quot;, which under the hood calls ./configure with the stock debian flags. Your project doesn&#x27;t use autoconf? Put this in the rules file:<p>override_dh_auto_configure:\n  echo &quot;Skipping configure&quot;<p>Same for dh_test, or any other bit. The funky bit is that if your package needs some special treatment, you can cheat fairly easily. Just hijack a logically suitable no-op step and put the manual tweaks into the override.

I think a real &#x27;superior&#x27; AI must be able to follow all the various philosophical ideas we had and &#x27;understand&#x27; them at a deeper level than we do. Things such as &#x27;there is no purpose&#x27;/nihilism, extreme critical thinking about itself etc. If it doesn&#x27;t, if it can&#x27;t, it can&#x27;t be superior to us by definition.<p>I think, given these philosophical ideas, we anthropomorphize if we even think in terms of good/evil about any AI. I believe if there is ever any abrupt change due to vastly better AI, it is more of the _weird_ kind than the good or evil kind. But weird might be very scary indeed, because at some level we humans tend to like that things are somewhat predictable.<p>I believe the whole discussion about AI is a bit artificial (no pun). Various kinds of AI are already deeply embedded in some parts of society and causes real changes - such as airplane planning systems, trading on the stock market etc. Those cause very real world effects and affect very realy people. And they tend to be already pretty weird. We don&#x27;t really see it all the time, but it acts, and its &#x27;will&#x27;, so to speak, is a weird product of our own desires.<p>Also, I wonder whether and how societies would compare to AIs. We have mass psychological phenomena in societies that even the brightest persons only become aware of some time after &#x27;they have fulfilled their purpose&#x27;. Are societies self-ware as a higher level of intelligence? And have they always been?<p>Are we, maybe simply the substrate, for evolution of technology, much as biology is the substrate for the evolution of us? Are societies, algorithms, AI, ideas & memes simply different forms of &#x27;higher beings&#x27; on &#x27;top&#x27; of us? Does it even make sense that there is a hierarchy and to think hierarchically at all about these things?<p>I have the impression our technology makes us, apart from other things, a lot more conscious. But that is not a painless process at all, quite the contrary. But so far, we seem to have decided to go this route? Will we, as humans, eventually become mad in some way from this?<p>There are mad people. Can we build superior AI if we do not understand madness? Will AI understand madness?",1392968376

As I already pointed out, except for the functional difference between supertasters, food preference is purely subjective and not worth arguing about.<p>What is objective is the amount of cacao and milk fat (amongst other ingredients) used in the manufacture of chocolate candy. If what you desire is something with actual chocolate in it, American manfuactured candy (pick your brand, it doesn&#x27;t matter), it will, objectively, contain less chocolate on average than most other places in the world.<p>What Hershey&#x27;s does to their milk chocolate is called adulteration. It is manipulating the amount of the key ingredient in something to produce it is as cheaply as possible. It&#x27;s the same thing fast food vendors do to their meat to make it go farther.<p>It may very well be true that American tastes prefer lower-quality chocolate, but that&#x27;s a chicken and egg problem that I&#x27;m not prepared to debate.<p>I actually find it ironic that you would suggest that supertasters who prefer taste over texture would prefer American Kit Kat bars, as everything I&#x27;ve been led to believe suggests that those who actually prefer taste would lean towards the chocolate with higher milk fat and cacao and less palm oil and wax. The later would provide a more consistent mouthfeel, but would sacrifice taste (which, in my humble opinion, is exactly what happens with American chocolate).<p>Of course, because supertaster is not a better/worse proposition, but just a different experience with tastes, perhaps there&#x27;s something about the bitterness of high percentages of cacao (like coffee, green tea, or grapefruit juice) that is unpalatable to someone with a heightened sense of taste.",1392966868

This was around the mid-90s.<p>&quot;The fundamental building block of HDML content is the card. The user agent displays and allows the user to interact with cards of information. Logically, a user navigates through a series of HDML cards, reviews the contents of each, enters requested information, makes choices, and moves on to another or returns to a previously visited card.&quot; - HDML spec [1]<p>I&#x27;m not sure what Fred Wilson is getting at with &quot;cards&quot; today (he seems to be lamenting restricted APIs more than anything with the UI paradigm?).

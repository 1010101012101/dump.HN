Maybe it didn't work half as well as I am recalling, but even then, it was better than DC, where it always turns to ""where do you work?""

2729012,comment,2728706,2728761,52,0,wheels,,,"Your comment is wrong on so many levels:<p>• It's not even on topic.  This post is not about general memory usage; it's about fragmentation in the javascript VM – i.e. that a system object existing in a general memory page precludes that page from being garbage collected / deallocated even though the lifetime of system objects is very different.  This is not a trivial matter for which the only explanation is laziness.<p>• It's spoken like someone who's never seriously worked on a large open source project.  Memory profiling and leak tracking is done widely and often (using valgrind, mostly).<p>• You speak as if you know how much memory a web browser should use.  How do you know?  Have you worked on modern web browsers?  Or are you just, as I assume, by fiat deciding that 500 MB is too much?<p>• There's very often a speed / memory usage tradeoff.  At present, especially for web browsers, users tend to prefer speed.  (i.e. how many rendered pages do you cache per tab so that clicking the back button is next to instant?)<p>• The right time to profile and optimize is usually later in the development process.  We all know the famous quote.  Optimizing early tends to lead to ugly code that, amusingly, is harder to optimize later.",1309851761

This is especially true of the people who frequent domain registrar services.<p>Second, you claim the market is failing.  It's doing exactly the opposite.

Fortunately I have been using a password manager for years (Keepass) and don't share passwords site-to-site. So I don't fuck around with security, or try not to.<p>But, you do. It's hindsight, sure, but if you read HN you definitely know better, yet you did it anyway. You've learned your lesson, and hopefully the next time a service you frequent is hacked your exposure will be minimal. But it took something like this for that to happen. I'm thinking a lot of sites have had shitty security for years like Hover et al and are only now, with all the publicity surrounding recent breaches of security, beginning to realize they can't get away with it for much longer.<p>So just like anyone can cut you some slack, I can cut organizations some slack, <i>for now,</i> especially in cases like this where it looks like someone without the requisite technical expertise was given too much control over technical decisions (i.e. not the engineers' fault). That kind of shit happens all the time even if it ideally shouldn't. But, things have changed and security concerns have gained enough publicity that even clueless middle managers should have some inkling that it's important, so IMVHO if you haven't gotten your shit together security-wise as an organization by the end of this year, you're probably inept enough that I shouldn't be doing business with you.<p>In the meantime I'll practice the security diligence I preach.",1309851181

2728954,comment,2727005,2728408,4,0,wnight,,,"> Comical. You think the USA is wiretapping all phones everywhere? How does this work? How has this massive conspiracy not been exposed?<p>Not all, everywhere. Just most, most everywhere. And it has been exposed, and been lost under Britney's sex scandals and such. Domestic wiretapping was exposed in 2003 or so. Massive signal-gathering was exposed in the 'room641' case. PBS Frontline did a show about it. There was a lawsuit against it until the FISA was used to quash it. The US government is a member of the ECHELON program, a sat-call sniffing program, and has been for 20+ years. Leaks show the USA has access to many foreign telephone networks (Pakistan, etc) and can snoop on most cellular networks. And that's just some of what we know about.<p>With the reciprocation of a few allies the USA has access to probably 90% of the digital communication outside of China and a few other countries.<p>> You missed my point and misunderstood my question.<p>No, I did not. Though obviously you missed my reply.<p>> What do you expect the US to do in Syria? We don't hold any leverage there.<p>First, stop funding or participating in abuses there. Second, acknowledge past and present abuses, and offer a world court use of its surveillance to identify as many criminals in the government as possible.<p>Enable those who do have leverage to point to specific events in dealing with Syria, and make it easier for the oppressed to get help.<p>> Politically we have no appetite for another war with another Muslim country.<p>Politically there was no will for the other ones. That's why the government lied about the reasons.<p>> Done and done as GHFigs points out: President Barack Obama strongly condemned [...]<p>Soft and useless. Unless the USA acknowledges its crimes - for instance delivering prisoners to Syria for torture, they can't push too hard for fear of the backlash. Offer Bush/Cheney/Rumsfeld to the Iraqis as the start of an apology for the war and you might start to seem serious.<p>The USA has the ability (through electronic surveillance and local intel assets) to specifically identify many of the crimes committed, the army/police officer who killed the civilian, the officer who ordered it, a recording of the order being sent, who authorized it, etc. Even spotty records would help collaborate local reports.",1309849781

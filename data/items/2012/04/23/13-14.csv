He thinks that a 20 something english major is a better manager for a software engineer than a 40 something software engineer?<p>Plus he seems to completely miss a separate alternative for software engineers over 35-- start their own businesses.<p>I think the perception that 40 year olds are not up to date on technology is laughable-- just look at how resistant 20-sometings are to erlang.  This resistance or letting skills get old can come from two sources: First, some people just are kinda blub programmers who never want to learn something new. The second is that its possible to be pigeonholed. I was that way- forced to write windows software for years (several companies who had mac apps who hired me with the promise of working on the mac app then switched me to windows because I had windows experience) until I seriously de-emphasized that experience on my resume, and started outright refusing.<p>The reason companies hire people right out of college is really simple:  They want engineers who are going to accept being over worked due to bad management practices.  They think it is easier and cheaper to just hire out of college than to fix their broken processes.  I've seen this everywhere - from Microsoft where the managers have some technical back ground but the company culture is broken- to Amazon where the managers are DMV rejects <i>and</i> the company culture is broken. (notable exceptions exist in both cases, of course.)<p>It is cheaper to hire someone right out of college than to hire someone with 10 years experience... the problem is, ""professional"" management thinks both are equally productive.  In my experience this is not the case.<p>I had to laugh when, in 2007, Zuckerberg was on the stage at Startup Weekend claiming that 20 year olds were more productive-- at the time he was too young to even know the difference!

The fact is that computer science is only really been a legitament profession for maybe 40-30 years. When it first was taught no one could of predicted the speed at which software engineering would become a dominate force in the world's economy nor seen how fast technology changes. So in the begginning computer science was viewed like math, physics, or any science it was taught so that you learned the basic first then you learned the newer and more innovative things. This is no longer the case. Yes most programmer will experience c/c++, some may even lean x86 and MIPS, but we now know that computer science require a constant change. It is no longer acceptable to just know c/c++ you must learn new languages all the time. Whether you decide to learn node,js, ruby, scala, or what ever cutting edge languages we are not groom to pick up languages in 2 weeks if needed to.

There is a difference between significant digits in measurement, and significant digits in analysis.<p>First, a quick definition from Wikipedia [1]: leading and trailing zeros which are merely placeholders to indicate the scale of the number.<p>In measurement, significant digits indicate the precision of the measurement. This eliminates ambiguity. For example, if I were to write:<p>> The prongs should be spaced 1.000"" on their centers.<p>This means that the level of precision should be to the thousandths of an inch. If I were to write:<p>> The prongs should be spaced 1.0"" on their centers.<p>This means the level of precision should be to the tenth of an inch.<p>The former might be used in the engineering of something like a rocket booster control, while the latter might be used in something like woodworking of rudimentary farm implements (like an ox yolk).<p>The author's lament is that computer scientists  -- although I'm not sure <i>who</i> exactly he's talking bout here -- don't pay attention to the meaning of the significant digits in use.<p>Let's say I (not a computer scientist) were to publish benchmarks that said:<p>> Under Ruby 1.9.3-p125, the method DateTime#parse takes 3.098193 seconds to parse the string ""2011-05-25 00:00:03 -0400"" at 100,000 iterations.<p>Because I used six digits to the right of the decimal point, I have implied that my level of precision is six digits. Put another way, I'm claiming that my benchmark is accurate to six decimal places. This is obviously not true. The value varies each time I run it, and my system isn't nearly controlled enough (I have lots of other processes running) to express this level of precision.<p>Most hackers just make this assumption. Because of our familiarity with the subject matter, we know that there is variation in benchmark runtime from execution to execution. Many hackers lack a background in formal engineering training as well, so we don't see the implied precision in significant digits. It is a useful tool for communication, however.

Then it took me a couple of hours to essentially duplicate the ListView functionality, except a working version.<p>The thing is developing a GUI framework isn't rocket science, its been done before and there are plenty of examples of reasonably well designed frameworks out there, Swing and Qt to name a couple.<p>Software is complex so it takes a while (years at least, probably decades) for a human brain to gain real perspective on what's important and what isn't in software development.

And I'm pretty sure they're happy only dealing with merchants.  There was a good article a couple of years ago on why Google Payments was having such a hard time competing against Paypal, and the reason was customer service.  Paypal spent more on customer service than Google did (at the time, not sure about now) and this allowed the overall customer service to be better.<p>When you have regular people in the mix, it makes business much, much harder, and I'm pretty sure the credit card companies don't want to deal with that BS.  So they're perfectly fine letting others deal with customers directly.<p>If they shifted to the system that the author described, all of the load would be on Mastercard/VISA, including things like refunds, etc, and that's not exactly a high-margin business.<p>So, it's a nice thought, but having a single point of service/privacy/failure likely won't happen with the status quo, unless a completely new merchant shows up willing to take on everything associated with payments.",1335187259

I want to be wealthy; I wish everyone were.<p>I feel like I'm an old (28) knight, having learned the hard way that people are not honorable. For the record, I've seen more disgusting behavior in supposedly ""world-changing"" startups than many people see in their lives, and far more than I saw in finance, which is supposed to be unethical and full of greed but (quite honestly) doesn't look very different from anywhere else. The most ethical of the 5 companies where I've worked was in finance.<p>First, it's not about what you <i>want</i>, it's about what you <i>do</i>. There's nothing wrong with wanting to have money. You <i>should</i> want to have money if you're smart. Why? Because money is a vote and the World's First Problem is that most decisions aren't being made my smart or competent people. So get out there, do great work, and see if you can make a mark. You're only doing wrong if you start making moral compromises to get money or influence. If you turn unethical, then you become part of the more severe World's Second Problem, which is that the few genuinely smart people in positions of power and influence are generally unethical.<p>There's nothing wrong with wanting to have financial freedom and autonomy. If you don't have these things, chances are that your life will amount to very little. That's not the same thing as wanting to be a billionaire, though. If your net worth is $3 billion and you're trying to get to $6B to show up that other guy, then your motives are probably not good.<p>Social climbers I find pretty revolting, but the desire to do good work and be well paid for it is, I've come to realize, honorable.<p>Now, bad people do slimy things for all kinds of reasons, and often those reasons have little to do with material gain. Sometimes it's status or vengeance, and sometimes it's just a desire ""to see what happens"". Malevolent curiosity is a powerful motivator having nothing to do with money or measurable personal benefit. Again, it's not peoples' motivations that make them bad or good. It's what they actually do.<p>I spent a lot of time trying to figure out why I encountered far more sleaze in VC-funded startups than in finance, and I think I figured it out. <i>False poverty.</i> Now, I'd he hard-pressed to call a startup CEO making $150,000 per year ""poor"", but a lot of these people feel poor, given that a 27-year-old venture capitalist with no accomplishments to his name is making twice that, just because his daddy got him into Harvard Business School. When people get a sense that they ""should"" be doing so much better (being VCs instead of being founders with their hands out) they feel poor, they feel desperate, and they act desperate.<p>Finance has its share of slime, for sure, but the false poverty is less prevalent. Bankers know they <i>aren't</i> poor and that they're not allowed to act that way.<p>This might also explain why the politics and in-fighting in low-paying but ""glamorous"" industries like fashion and UES nonprofitistan are so much worse. Because these people are paid poorly, they have a sense of living on a precipice and will do <i>anything</i> to avoid falling off. Although this is also a false poverty (because most of these people could change industries and do OK) it has the same effect.<p>The conclusion of all this should be the obvious one. Greed isn't good, but hunger is worse.",1335186384

You start winning on the day of your first paycheck and you <i>never lose</i>, relative to research, because programming is a safer career than research.<p>Be careful about cherry-picking Wall Street and Instagram when choosing examples: Those are just the sensational ones. If Wall Street disappeared tomorrow, and venture funding with it, <i>plumbers</i> would still make more money than the average researcher. (Remember: A lot of research work is done by  grad students, whose salaries make postdocs look pampered.)<p>""The very best students and researchers don't have trouble finding funding"" - this is like saying ""talented farmers have no trouble growing food"". First, you're selecting a group of winners and then looking for evidence of winning. Lo, you found some! The second problem is that this statement doesn't account for effort: Farmers work hard and take risks for the money, and researchers do as well. As a researcher who wants to succeed you must have grants in the front of your mind one third of the time, and in the back your your mind most of the rest of the time, because success is <i>measured</i> in grants: Your pay, promotion, rate of progress, and reputation are directly contingent on the amount of grant money you can raise. Unless you're Einstein, maybe, but see above under ""winning the lottery"".<p>Face it, society doesn't value research as highly as going concerns. When you think about it, why should that surprise anyone? Businesses are a sure thing by comparison. You turn the crank, profits fall out. Often, happiness and human health fall out, too. Nursing, for example, saves lives. It saves them one at a time, but they get saved, and it's a <i>sure thing</i>: You don't need to make a bet against long odds. Change a bedpan, make someone considerably happier; notice that the patient has stopped breathing, save a life. Turn the crank. Turn the wheel the world has given you.",1335186202

In my, maybe old, mindset, I try to break even as fast as we can and THEN start growing.<p>I see a lot of exceptions where this way of company startup would not work, but a lot of them should do it this way imho. The funding => jumping too high method is too much slot machine for me. Especially if you are not doing consumer services/products, it is almost always possible, if your idea has merit, to run a profit even before you built anything. Then funding is a much safer bet.",1335186149

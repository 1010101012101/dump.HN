No framework - use custom elements.<p>Frameworks tie you into their silo, which is different and isolated from all the others. This is a terrible situation for developers (and ultimately users as dev effort is wasted duplicating things for each framework).<p>Custom elements are a way to define your own HTML tags. These work like other elements: they have attributes, events, child nodes and properties. They can be placed on a simple static web page, or wired together into complex apps. Elements are (mostly<i>) naturally interoperable with other elements and even the plethora of frameworks.<p>Where Polymer fits in is that it&#x27;s a library that help you write custom elements with support for templates, marshaling attributes, data-binding, etc. as well as some polyfills for web component standards.<p>It&#x27;s very useful, IMO, but the real beauty is that Polymer elements don&#x27;t</i> leak to the outside that they&#x27;re made with Polymer - they&#x27;re just elements. If you use another custom element framework you can still use Polymer-made elements.<p>* The big caveat is this thing called Shadow DOM which is hard to polyfill. Polymer uses a near-polyfill called Shady DOM that can be important to use in some situations. It&#x27;s still possible to interop with other frameworks with some configuration though.",1437080125

I aspire towards, as I said, a more measured approach.<p>Let me make my view perfectly clear; there is a level of harassment that becomes _material_ and is no longer simply a speech issue, but given your citing of FPH, I don&#x27;t believe that&#x27;s what is necessarily being discussed.  (I also think that&#x27;s a difficult instance to discuss, due to the frank level of &quot;politicking&quot; that&#x27;s been involved in that whole situation, although that (the building of a self serving movement either for or against a social justice issue) is another potentially worrying bit of fallout from a &quot;warlike&quot; mindset and response (for lack of a better word).

But a few decades ago, a person arguing that if interracial couples should be allowed to marry then so should homosexual couples would have been seen as someone who was against homosexual couples.  Just like someone who is pro-polygamy today is seen as being an attack on homosexuals for daring to compare loving homosexuals to the abusive relationships of non-consensual polygamy.  (Yes, I clearly worded that last bit in a leading and emotionally charged way, which is to make a point of how people treat it online currently.)<p>Now, you could limit it to only abuse against a single person, like harassment, but to a large extent that is already illegal and I think we are clearly talking about larger ideals that are considered hateful.<p>Consider the argument that if you allow interracial marriage then you should have to allow homosexual marriage.  In a culture where the norm is oppression of homosexuals, such a statement can be considered abusive to interracial couples and thus shouldn&#x27;t be protected.

You were just pointed at the shortcomings of your approach<p>I &quot;addressed&quot; the shortcomings of &quot;my approach&quot; by showing that Python (the language, not the community) allows you to access and manipulate the data you claimed was important and missing.<p>I don&#x27;t believe it is necessary for most simple functions to know what their name is.  I do believe the demonstrated code is self documenting enough to not require a documentation string.  You made those &quot;requirements&quot;.  I never claimed that <i>every</i> function must be a lambda - you seem to be implying I am, so I am explicitly stating that I do not.<p>Here&#x27;s a place where you really do need a named function (due to deficiencies in Python&#x27;s lambda implementation):<p><pre><code>  >>> def named_lambda(procedure, name, documentation=&#x27;&#x27;):
  ...     procedure.__name__ = &#x27;<lambda {}>&#x27;.format(name)
  ...     procedure.__doc__ = documentation
  ...     return procedure
  ... 
  >>> absolute_path = named_lambda(lambda path: path if path.startswith(&#x27;/&#x27;) else &#x27;/&#x27; + path, &#x27;absolute_path&#x27;, &#x27;Return the absolute unix path from a given path name&#x27;)

  &#x27;<lambda absolute_path>&#x27;
  >>> absolute_path.__doc__
  &#x27;Return the absolute unix path from a given path name&#x27;
</code></pre>
Of course, that&#x27;s completely silly... since the point of a lambda function generally is that the function is generally small enough and short-lived enough that it does not need a name or documentation.<p>> the Python community generally prefers stupidly simple, easy to understand solutions.<p>Which, despite your protests, includes using lambdas!<p>> Using magic attributes to argue against it just makes it worse - remember this is a thread about idiomatic Python code bases.<p>How else does a function &quot;know its own name&quot; unless it uses the &quot;magic&quot; attribute &quot;__name__&quot;?  Oh, you prefer &quot;func_name&quot;?  That&#x27;s cute:<p><pre><code>  >>> named_lambda.func_name
  &#x27;named_lambda&#x27;
  >>> named_lambda.__name__

I see people&#x27;s use of this term as a signal that they have accepted the framing of warfare, because by use it appears to mean &quot;my enemies who are so wrong and unjustly aggressive that I have the right to fight them tooth and nail.&quot;<p>Unfortunately, the people &quot;on the other side&quot; will tend to see things the same way. And our tendency is to define the enemy group vaguely, over-generalizing by including lots of people who are not really malicious or even wrong. Maybe our anger makes us hungry for targets. Or <i>maybe</i> we are just so upset about the disagreement itself that we are happy to have a list of bad things the other side does as a way of trying to discredit people who are not involved in those bad things, but disagree with us. Not everyone is honest about <i>why</i> they want to hurt the people they publicly declare as enemies. Sometimes it is just intolerance of disagreement, or simple sadism.<p>Even if the damage among the &quot;combatants&quot; didn&#x27;t matter, it is often the &quot;civilian bystanders&quot; who are hurt. This is totally nuts. Even if these issues are worth being passionate about, they are not <i>rationally</i> comparable to warfare, they don&#x27;t <i>rationally</i> justify war tactics. This isn&#x27;t the Thunderdome, it&#x27;s the civil society we all have to live in. And we don&#x27;t have a real choice about whether that society includes people we disagree with, so it&#x27;s better if we come to terms with that and find ways either to fence off or compromise in the common space, to mutual advantage.<p>For example, I think you&#x27;re stacking the deck with your talk about &quot;left-aligned mobs&quot; and that you are intentionally eliding the history of right-wing fascism to make &quot;your side&quot; look better than &quot;the other side.&quot; I&#x27;m a realist, I don&#x27;t think people will usually be civil without special effort. So for all I know based on your rhetoric, you&#x27;d identify me as an enemy and a threat based on my views, and even kill me if you had the chance; I will defensively avoid testing that. But that&#x27;s as far as I should <i>rationally</i> go. The important part is that whatever our disagreements, and they may be very deep, I don&#x27;t need to <i>assume</i> that we are at war, that I am a warrior and you are my enemy, and focus on somehow figuratively &quot;killing&quot; you. In my view, that would actually be very silly and self-destructive. I don&#x27;t actually benefit from trying to damage you, it&#x27;s pointless, it doesn&#x27;t help my causes and it pollutes the civil society I have to live in. (Of course it is another issue if you decide to literally threaten me and my lawful interests, but then it is a purely defensive and practical issue; I don&#x27;t need to respond to that by declaring war on your &quot;tribe&quot; and I certainly can&#x27;t pre-empt that by turning every disagreement into an intractable &quot;war.&quot;)",1437078721

If A and B are Swift types, then the code to invoke a.someMethod() might be substantially different from the code for b.someMethod().

Both will compile down to a call to objc_msgSend, passing the object and the &quot;someMethod&quot; selector to it as parameters.<p>So yes, it looks like the types get erased on the ObjC end of things, but I don&#x27;t think the Swift end of things has to care very much.

A computer will never live as long as The Trial.<p>I realized this, independently, years ago and it shook me down to my boots. I was working on something, I don&#x27;t even remember now what it was, some client project probably, and I happened to glance over at the stack of books on my desk, one of which was a 2nd edition camel book, and suddenly, there it was: that book had outlived probably every single line of code I had written when it was published.<p>A book about a programming language that -- unfortunately -- was rapidly being pushed into the museum of computing history would outlive most of the code written by anybody that ever read it.<p>I couldn&#x27;t write any code for a few days. It seemed pointless.<p>Eventually I came to a new understanding with software development. It&#x27;s like spending your life making Buddhist sand mandalas. You spend your days, hunched over a table, moving one little bit at a time, and if you&#x27;re lucky, you create something beautiful, and a short time later someone else will come along and sweep it away and start making something else in its place.<p>It helps to be concerned less about the code itself than about what it does for people. Sand mandalas give people an experience, and so does code: code today helps people communicate, relax, learn, or spend their lives making other things. There is a little bit of legacy in that at least, though nothing that anybody will ever remember you for.<p>Programming is still an important part of me. I still try to write artful code. I still feel a little bit of revulsion when staring at bad code (or, worse, intentionally bad code). But I don&#x27;t view it as my life&#x27;s work anymore. Software will never be my magnum opus, if I am lucky enough to ever make one.<p>Anyway, _why was one of the most beautiful things ever made by a programmer.",1437078508

(Which, again, may be less of a problem for other nations than it is for us.) If 100 consumers feel a contract term is unfair and so decline to meet their obligations, the firm will file a suit against e.g. the 20 least likely ones to contest rather than settle, which is good for the firm&#x27;s attorneys (or is it barristers?).

It certainly wasn&#x27;t welcomed by small shopkeepers who enter into relatively simple contracts with their customers (e.g. to purchase an expensive item on terms). To compensate, such firms might have told their customers &quot;the new law means it doesn&#x27;t matter what&#x27;s on the contract&quot;. Although untrue, that statement would be plausible enough to generate more sales, at least until consumers heard enough stories about court cases that they no longer believed it.

Have you ever spent hours stepping through the lifecycle of an object, going through many different components spread out across the codebase and wished that you had spent all that time solving new problems instead?<p>I see 3 issues here.<p>1) Most people haven&#x27;t dealt with those issues enough. There are complex programs but there are also many simple program as well. And unless one deals with hard to debug concurrency / pointer / mutable state errors they will not appreciate immutability. They might pay lip service to it, because it is cool, but they will not appreciate it enough to start rewriting their codebase in it.  That is a bit like fault tolerance, unless they have been woken up at 3am because their main larger server process segfaulted and had to debug, they will not think about isolated units of failure, about supervision, durable peristent snapshots/checkpoints, monitoring etc. They of course will say that &quot;fault tollerance is good&quot; but it is good in an abstract, general way.<p>2) Those that dealt with these issue might accept the state (pun indended) of affairs and never realize there is another way of doing things. I mean they just accept that you have to have locks and mutable state and mutexes and dangling pointers and then spend months debugging hard to track concurrency errors at 3am. That is just how software development works and it is as good as it gets.<p>3) People realize there is something better, they know about, read about, played with it.

Die stacking is one way to do that, and it&#x27;s the only one that isn&#x27;t just wild fantasy.<p>Another would be for the die to have multiple layers within a single die - which can&#x27;t be done with current technology, but isn&#x27;t physically impossible.  Basically what you&#x27;d need to do is similar to PCB fabrication - you need to create &quot;blind&quot; and &quot;buried&quot; features within a series of stacked layers.<p>Obviously that capability doesn&#x27;t exist right now, but you could look at using an ion beam to create a planar mask that targets only a single layer within a multilayer wafer.  The particles travel through material without depositing energy until they reach a critical threshold [1], after which they rapidly deposit nearly all of their energy.  This allows you to give the beam a specific &quot;depth&quot;, in other words it can be targeted in 3D.  Perhaps - because it&#x27;s a particle beam, not an EM wave - it might also be less susceptible to some of the problems caused by the wave nature of light, even in a more conventional application.<p>I know it from proton radiotherapy (a good general rundown of the technology here [2]), and I wonder if it couldn&#x27;t also be used for something like this.  A lot of problems would have to be solved.  You&#x27;d be talking about a substantially different process from standard wafer production, you&#x27;d have to tighten up the Z-resolution, etc.  No idea if it&#x27;d work or not in the end, but I think it&#x27;d be interesting to look.<p>Or alternately maybe we figure out some additive/subtractive method that lets us create multiple layers on a single die another way.

The famous Unix guru Eric Raymond had a very illuminating post on this:<p><a href=""http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=260"" rel=""nofollow"">http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=260</a><p>If you ask most Americans who invaded Poland in 1939, most will simply say ""Germany"" or ""the Nazis"". Few will mention the ""Soviet Union"" or ""the Communists"". Even fewer will say ""the National Socialist German Workers Party"". That's part of the Gramscian Damage.<p>University humanities and social science departments are relentlessly conformist, though they certainly don't see themselves that way. Since they largely control the inflow of ideas into the culture, they can choke off whatever they want. So, the CCP largely gets a pass.",1254635932
859723,comment,859399,859631,0,0,espeed,,,"The organization would not lobby for any position directly. Instead, lobbying firms that specialize in the given policy areas would lobby on behalf of the users that support those policies, and the users could have a say in which lobbying firms are used for particular issues.<p>Regarding how to handle majority vs minority positions, that's a good question that I have been debating myself. One way would be to use money allocated for each position to hire separate firms to lobby for the given position. The pro is that if the competing positions are truly what the people want and have not been manipulated by corporate lobbyists, then at least the people's voice is being heard. The downside is that you are creating an arms race so the people are spending more money than they need to because money from either side is canceling out the effects of the other.<p>Another way you could approach it is make it so that money from the minority nullifies the money from the majority <i>before</i> it's paid to lobbyists so users in the majority and minority end up paying less (the minority pays nothing and the majority only pays the difference). This keeps lobbyists from being the major benefactor and saves the people's money so they can use it to support other issues. The downside is that the minority might want its money spent anyway and then you get into a type of Prisoner's Dilemma (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoners_dilemma"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoners_dilemma</a>).<p>Allowing the money to be spent may be the best way since it is the voice of the electorate -- even if the electorate has opposing views because at least it's the voice of the electorate, not corporations.",1254635249

Usually people use a combination of both database (which what I was talking about) and table sharding (w/ replication,clustering,etc.) to achieve scalability. I've encountered several highly-scalable db environments like these.<p><i>It's not application-transparent</i><p>There are several databases that have features that can make sharding transparent to your application.<p><i>and it's an operational nightmare</i><p>it depends on the RDBMS that you're using.",1254634927

He compared them to the English enclosure movement of the 16-17th centures - no one really believes they're protecting innovation so much as providing a way for the established companies to declare their territory and ward off upstarts.<p>Of course, it didn't stop him from recommending that they look for patentable aspects of their software. The other benefit to holding patents is that the best way to prevent an infringement suit is to have the ability to counter-sue based on your own patent collection.",1254634406
859712,comment,859686,859686,0,0,patio11,,,"<i>i wonder how a place like california got into such mess.</i><p>They were ground zero for a pair of US bubbles.  This caused the state's revenues to skyrocket.  Believing revenues would always skyrocket, groups which have essentially captured the state and municipality budgeting processes voted themselves large increases in benefits.  It is politically impossible to reduce those benefits once enacted, yet they automatically snowball in costs every year.  Its like the miracle of compound interest, except in reverse, and with the full principal being due every year.<p>The bubbles have burst and California no longer sees the potential for staggering revenue growth every year, but will see double-digit increases in benefits outlays for the politically powerful groups.<p>Bonus points: every time California has a short-term lack of funds they negotiate with their beneficiary groups to trade a lack of increase this year (note: not a cut, just less increase than they would have otherwise gotten) in favor of a new entitlement due in N years, whose NPV is astoundingly higher than the savings due to the lack-of-increase.",1254634133

The costs can be really insidious in unexpected ways.<p>My state is now offering insurance benefits to domestic partners, but the amount that the state covers for insurance (for example) is now taxable income.  That means paying taxes on several thousand dollars that they never actually see.<p>However you feel about religious issues, or how ""marriage"" should be defined, It's kind of absurd that a certain segment of state employees doing equal work get shorted on benefits for their household.",1254633828

In your sharding+replication example, what happens when the datacenters containing your master and slave lose their network link?  There's no way you can maintain write availability for clients in both datacenters while also providing the ACID Consistency guarantee.  (But systems like Dynamo or CouchDB can do so while guaranteeing eventual consistency.)<p>After seeing some real-world, big business problems solved with weakened consistency guarentees, I'm skeptical that there are as many problems that ""need"" ACID as most people think.  Rather, I think that (a) most engineers have not yet been exposed to the reasonable alternatives to ACID, and so have not actually thought about whether they ""need"" it, and (b) most businesses do not yet have the knowledge they need to weigh ACID's benefits against its availability costs.",1254633334

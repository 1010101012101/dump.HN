Such codes can be used over UDP readily. Using such codes over TCP is quite difficult.<p>Besides the usual difficulties, traditional codes have a structure that precludes their composability. There are several issues with this. One is that they cannot be re-encoded without being decoded. The ability to re-encode blindly is crucial to achieving capacity. For a theoretical treatment of this, I would refer you  to:\n<a href=""http://202.114.89.42/resource/pdf/1131.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://202.114.89.42/resource/pdf/1131.pdf</a>\nThe article is rather mathematical but the abstract provides the gist of the results ""\nWe consider the use of random linear network coding in lossy packet networks. In particular, we consider the following simple strategy: nodes store the packets that they receive and, whenever they have a transmission opportunity, they send out coded packets formed from random linear combinations of stored packets. In such a strategy, intermediate nodes perform additional coding yet do not decode nor wait for a block of packets before sending out coded packets. Moreover, all coding and decoding operations have polynomial complexity.\nWe show that, provided packet headers can be used to carry an amount of side-information that grows arbitrarily large (but independently of payload size), random linear network coding achieves packet-level capacity for both single unicast and single multicast connections and for both wireline and wireless networks.  ""<p>The benefit of this composability, which we had first shown theoretically, is illustrated in TCP  in the following paper that recently appeared in Proceedings of IEEE<p><a href=""http://dandelion-patch.mit.edu/people/medard/papers2011/Network%20CodingMeets%20TCP-%20Theory%20and%20Implementation.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dandelion-patch.mit.edu/people/medard/papers2011/Netw...</a><p>The theory of network coding promises significant benefits in network performance, especially in lossy networks and in multicast and multipath scenarios. To realize these benefits in practice, we need to understand how coding across packets interacts with the acknowledgment (ACK)-based flow control mechanism that forms a central part of todays Internet protocols such as transmission control protocol (TCP). Current approaches such as rateless codes and batch-based coding are not compatible with TCPs retransmission and sliding-window mechanisms. In this paper, we propose a new mechanism called TCP/NC that incorporates network coding into TCP with only minor changes to the protocol stack, thereby allowing incremental deployment. In our scheme, the source transmits random linear combinations of packets currently in the con- gestion window. At the heart of our scheme is a new interpretation of ACKs the sink acknowledges every degree of freedom (i.e., a linear combination that reveals one unit of new information) even if it does not reveal an original packet immediately (...)  An important feature of our solution is that it allows intermediate nodes to perform re-encoding of packets, which is known to provide significant throughput gains in lossy networks and multicast scenarios.<p>The exciting news that prompted the piece in TR is that we now had an implementation ""in the wild"", in a simple Amazon proxy, which required significant engineering and works remarkably well.<p>The article refers to the issue of composability by pointing out  that there would be advantage if it were built ""directly into transmitters and routers, she says"". The more places you build this, the better.

He was fired because the Senate had blocked supply, and he was trying to secure alternative funding (which just isn't done). Kerr (the Governor General, who was mostly a figurehead but is technically the acting head of state) and Fraser (leader of the opposition) both suggested compromises. Whitlam thought that he didn't need the Senate or GG's cooperation, and that the whole ""Westminister system"" was a formality he could do without. So they sacked him.<p>tl;dr - there was a Constitutional crisis, with the House and Senate disagreeing.

I've met plenty of very successful founders (people that the HN crowd would have heard of) who are just not very impressive.<p>It also gets under my skin when VCs say, ""we don't invest in ideas, we invest in people"". To which I say, ""then most of you should be fired, because you suck at that."" Honestly, VCs are a lot better at picking ideas. Sure, a lot of these ""social"" apps are lame, but VCs actually do an excellent job of choosing what <i>ideas</i> to fund, given the constraints they face and their objective function (variance-agnostic expectancy maximization, 1-10 year payoffs). That they do well. On the other hand, they seem to be doing a lousy job of picking people (and at that, I would do a better job than 90+ percent of them).",1351080531

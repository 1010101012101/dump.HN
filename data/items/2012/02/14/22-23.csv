It doesn't address ordinal numbers at all, since addition works just fine with infinite ordinals, exactly the way the article claims you'd expect (what have I missed?).<p>The immediately obvious uses of infinity in calculus (the topic of the wikibooks article) are, according to wikipedia, termed the ""affinely extended real number system"" (I learned to just refer to the ""extended reals""), which heavily implies that the points within are considered extended real _numbers_.\n<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_reals"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_reals</a><p>The terms ""cardinal number"" and ""ordinal number"" both definitively include infinite quantities -- infinitely many, even.<p>The IEEE standard for floating point defines two infinite numbers.<p>Essentially, I'm in full agreement with tokenadult; the only relevant question is ""what do you mean by number?"".  But we can easily observe that varying infinities, including the calculus uses of infinity, are referred to as numbers all up and down the chain, including in the most unimpeachably correct sources, and that it walks and quacks like a duck, even if it may not quack in the precise manner of Anas Platyrhynchos.",1329260161

It also becomes clear that any single owner may come in many different guises. On the other hand, there are also many instances where an n-value is shared among seemingly unrelated owners. Distinguishing intentionally shared keys from other duplications (which are prone to fraud) is not straightforward, and is not facilitated by the volume of data we are dealing with (as 266 729 cases have to be considered). We leave it as a subject for further investigation into this ""fuzzy"" recognition problem to come up with good insights, useful information, and reliable counts.</i><p>Translation: ""This is not the only WTF we found in the survey.""<p>pg 7<p><i>Although 512-bit and 768-bit RSA moduli were factored in 1999 and 2009, respectively, 1.6% of the n-values have 512 bits (with 0.01% of size 384 and smallest size 374 occurring once) and 0.8% of size 768. Those moduli are weak, but still offer marginal security. A large number of the 512-bit ones were certifi\ned after the year 2000 and even until a few years ago. With 73.9% the most common size is 1024 bits, followed by 2048 bits with 21.7%. Sizes 3072, 4096, and 8192 contribute 0.04%, 1.5%, and 0.01%, respectively. The largest size is 16384 bits, of which there are 181 (0.003%).</i><p>Most certs have 1024 bit keys, but there are still semirecent 512 bit certs out there.<p>pg 8<p><i>Generation of a regular RSA modulus consists of \nfinding two random prime numbers. This must be done in such a way that these primes were not selected by anyone else before. The probability not to regenerate a prime is commensurate with the security level if NIST's recommendation is followed to use a random seed of bit-length twice the intended security level. Clearly, this recommendation is not always followed.</i><p>The nut graf of the paper, right?<p><i>footnote:</i><p><i>Much larger datasets can be handled without trouble. We chose not to describe the details of our calculation or how well it scales</i> (sapienti sat). <i>On a 1.8GHz i7 processor the straightforward approach would require about ten core-years and would not scale well. Inclusion of the p and q-values from Section 4 and the primes from related to the Debian OpenSSL vulnerability did not produce additional results.</i><p>Sapienti sat: ""a word to the wise"", which I take to mean, if you understand basic RSA attacks, this stuff is pretty straightforward. Notable: the Debian OpenSSL CSPRNG bug didn't seem to contribute to this finding.<p>pg 9<p><i>Irrespective of the way primes are selected (additive/sieving methods or methods using fresh random bits for each attempted prime selection), a variety of obvious scenarios is conceivable where poor initial seeding may lead to mishaps, with duplicate keys a consequence if no ""fresh"" local entropy is used at all. If the latter is used, the outcome may be worse: for instance, a not-properly-random fi\nrst choice may be prime right away (the probability that this happens is inversely proportional to the length of the prime, and thus non-negligible) and miss its chance to profi\nt from local entropy to become unique. But local entropy may lead to a second prime that is unique, and thus a vulnerable modulus.</i><p>To me the most interesting graf: here's a story about how generating a random prime is tricky <i>even when you have a reliable source of random bits.</i> You write a prime generator that taps entropy only after each guess. If your first guess is prime, you never tap entropy at all; you generate ""correct"" but insecure results.<p>Then, yadda dadda I skipped all the stuff about DSA and ElGamal except:<p><i>The only interesting fact we can report about ECDSA is the surprisingly small number of certi\ncates encountered that contain an ECDSA key (namely, just one), and the small number of certi\ncates signed by ECDSA (one self-signed and a handful of RSA keys).</i><p>Yay for progress!<p>pg 13<p><i>The lack of sophistication of our methods and fi\nndings make it hard for us to believe that what we have presented is new, in particular to agencies and parties that are known for their curiosity in such matters.

There are ordinal numbers that are infinite.  That is, that represent the order type of an infinite well ordered set.  Ordinal numbers do not for a ring but they do have an arithmetic defined.  They do form a semi-ring though.  If one wants to say that objects of a semi-ring are numbers then there are infinite numbers.  This also applies to cardinal numbers.<p>3.  There is the extended real number system which has the symbols -infinity and positive infinity attached to the real number system to form a compact set.  Think of the compact closure of the reals.  Again not a ring though.<p>4.  That said, there are infinite sets.   An infinite set is one that is not finite.  Or, in more precise terms, and infinite set is one that can be put into 1-1 correspondence with a proper subset of itself.   Cardinal numbers and cardinal number arithmetic deal with comparing sizes of sets.  Mostly useful for dealing with infinite sets.

We can't ""work around"" the paradox, because paradoxes are not allowed to exist. Nor can we conveniently try to redefine some of our constructs such that they don't encounter the paradox if those constructs live in a reality with constructs that <i>do</i> encounter the paradox.

In order to efficiently multiplex communication, you need a good protocol. That's what rules of order do: they impose a protocol between the participants that establishes who can speak when, and on what topic.<p>It's fusty and old fashioned, but it <i>works</i>. I've seen absolute screaming matches that nevertheless 1) reached conclusions and 2) were legally valid. The chair had to constantly shut down the screaming, had to evict several troublemakers from the meeting and to follow the rules with tyrannical strictness, <i>but it worked</i>.<p>That's almost the worst case possible for a meeting (the worst is descent into riot). Rules of order, like any technology, work well if properly applied.",1329257060

I cringe when somebody calls themselves a ""coder"" because my mental image is somebody who just throws it at the wall and stops as soon as it's good enough. (Many ""enterprise types"" certainly qualify.) ""Programmer"", to me at least, implies a greater level of methodology--not something that guarantees better code, but probably doesn't hurt.<p>I call myself a software developer, because I don't just write code.

9632516,comment,9631825,9631825,0,0,hosh,,,"Magic-as-a-technology has been popular in the sci-fi/fantasy genres for novels for the past ten, twenty years. I remember when it started getting popular, and I thought, &quot;this is awesome.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s not so awesome anymore, not for me at least.<p>Magic as a consequence of <i>shifts</i> in consciousness and awareness, as in, how you perceive and experience reality rather than any set of manipulable and repeatable forces -- that&#x27;s something more interesting. I&#x27;ve been seeing one or two indie authors writing in this space, listing their works for the under $5 bin at Amazon.<p>Now how to portray that in a game? That&#x27;s more difficult. One of the games I remember that have done something like this is Bastion. It wasn&#x27;t necessarily part of the game mechanic, though. It was the way the narration unfolded as a reaction to your actions that started changing experiences. Another is Batman: Arkem Asylum. Another one that comes to mind is Ninja Pizza Girl, though it wasn&#x27;t intended as a game on magic. It does have the shifts in consciousness though.<p>I expect to see a lot more of this when immersive VR/AR gets more popular. It&#x27;s very easy to start messing with frames and breaking out of them in ways that will seem mildly trippy.<p>Still, I&#x27;ve got some ideas of my own, and they are implementable even with a 2-D, top-down game.",1433033690

9632508,comment,9631810,9632476,0,0,phamilton,,,"Simple example:<p>You have two teams that work on different systems. A feature needs to be built that crosses the two systems. Do you:<p>a) Build a temporary team with 2 developers from each team.<p>b) Create a spec and hand it to Team 1. Team 1 adds an API for Team 2 to consume. Team 2 gets the API spec from Team 1 and integrates.<p>In situation (a), it&#x27;s likely your solution will blur the line between system 1 and system 2. The solution will be very specific and implementation details on each side will be blurred together influencing the result.<p>In situation (b), it&#x27;s likely that the API on system 1 is more generic and less coupled to the implementation details of system 2.<p>Situation (a) is generally faster to market. Situation (b) is generally easier to maintain, but can be much, much slower.<p>A specific example I&#x27;ve seen recently is a web server written in C doing string manipulation and a javascript client consuming data from this API.<p>If I&#x27;m working closely with the frontend developer, I&#x27;m going to say &quot;How about I send you the data raw, and you split on this sequence&quot;. Splitting in javascript is much simpler than strtok_r and as a bonus I offload the processing to the client. From a development standpoint, it takes 2 minutes to coordinate.<p>If I&#x27;m not working with the frontend team, then I&#x27;m probably going to go through the trouble of doing the string manipulation server side.<p>Does that make sense?

Exposed brick has a quality of functional beauty that reinforced concrete can never achieve, because there all the function is hidden inside the concrete and the outer shape is completely disconnected from function, either completely plain or arbitrarily ornamented. Brick on the other hand has a visible functional structure, the arches never lie and ornaments (which are never entirely afunctional in architecture: they distract the eye from dirt, and dirt will be unavoidable over time) can easily be included using standard or special blocks and blend in perfectly with the &quot;natural&quot; details that are there for technical reasons.<p>Occasionally i dream up a future that would have swarms of bricklaying bots that would turn architectural drawings into houses cheaper than poured concrete.

If you reverse it, though it was legal, it&#x27;s the vendor that has the problem (and has to collect the money). That&#x27;s why often only larger vendors will accept SEPA direct debit (small vendors will often insist that you use SEPA credit transfer instead that is a lot less customer-friendly in case of a fraudulent vendor). SEPA credit transfer is in my opinion not suitable for &quot;fast, spontanous&quot; payments, though, for reasons I won&#x27;t explain here.",1433030970

Yes, now is the time!<p>> Another bad part is Rust’s JSON handling. It badly needs macros which make things easier.<p>Actually this is not the end of the world. As you mentioned, Rust&#x27;s JSON library supports `ToJson` for primitive types, but also provides <i>compile-time</i> code generation for arbitrary `struct`s. Quoting the code from my project:[1]<p><pre><code>  #[derive(RustcDecodable, RustcEncodable)]\n  struct Msg {\n      cmd: String,\n\n      id: i32,\n      x: Option<i32>,\n      y: Option<i32>,\n\n      speed: Option<i32>,\n  }\n</code></pre>\nWhat the mystical `#[derive]` thing does is to direct the compiler to create the boilerplate for converting the `struct` to/from a string automatically. So, now you can do this:<p><pre><code>  // Decoding a JSON string\n  let text = r#&quot;{&quot;cmd&quot;: &quot;move&quot;, &quot;x&quot;: 5, &quot;y&quot;: 10, &quot;speed&quot;: 200}&quot;#;\n  let decoded: Msg = json::decode(text);\n\n  // Encoding a Msg object to JSON\n  let msg = Msg { cmd: &quot;new&quot;, x: 10, y: 20 };\n  let encoded = json::encode(msg);\n</code></pre>\nThe `Msg` struct is full of `Option`s because my project allowed many fields to be missing, but if the JSON messages in your protocol are in fairly similar format, you can eliminate most of them.<p>One more benefit of this approach is that it type checks. If the JSON you received is missing some fields that are not defined as `Option`, the decoding process produces an error! So you can be certain that you&#x27;re handling a valid JSON after the decoding stage. This is analogous to schemaless vs. schema-enforced database design.<p>> Compared to many static languages, the handlers look tidy. Compared to dynamic languages, they’re terrible.<p>This is the property of the Iron framework, not of the Rust language itself! Another web framework for Rust, namely Nickel.rs[2], provides much simpler APIs.<p>I believe the author of Iron is trying to establish essential things first, and build more &quot;user friendly&quot; APIs on top of them. (FWIW, the Rust project itself follows the similar strategy.)<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/barosl/pgr21-online-server/blob/master/src/server.rs"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/barosl/pgr21-online-server/blob/master/sr...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://nickel.rs/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nickel.rs/</a>",1433030625

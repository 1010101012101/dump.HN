It isn't what Rails is to Ruby or Django is to Python, really it is a way for Javascript to interact with the OS outside of the browser, e.g. on servers.

What I mean by that is that the operating system views the world as consisting of applications and their windows, whereas to the user the world consists of tasks the user is trying to accomplish.<p>For example, suppose I have four things I'm in the midst of working on at the same time. I've just deployed an update to a set of load balanced servers, and I have terminal windows open on each server in which I'm tailing the logs to see if any unusual errors show up. I've also got a browser window open on a monitoring page for that service. Finally, I've got a chat window where I'm in contact with an IT guy who is also monitoring the deployment. Let's call this task T1.<p>I'm also writing some code. I've got a terminal window for running tests, and doing git commands. I've got a browser open to look up documentation. I've got an editor window for editing. This is task T2.<p>I'm also reading HN. That uses a browser window, sometimes two or three if I go off following links. I'm also got a chat window opened discussing the more interesting HN news stories with a friend. This is task T3.<p>Finally, I'm putting together a report. I'm running some log analysis scripts in a terminal window, getting some other data from some web-based sources, and actually writing the report in a text editor. This is task T4.<p>I'm using four applications: Terminal (which I'll call A1), Safari (A2), Textmate (A3), and iChat (A4).<p>Here's a little table showing what is going on. Rows represent applications, columns represent my tasks. An 'X' where a row and column intersect means that the column's task involves windows of the row's application.<p><pre><code>    A1 = Terminal\n    A2 = Safari\n    A3 = Textmate\n    A4 = iChat\n\n    T1 = monitor recent deployment\n    T2 = writing code\n    T3 = reading HN\n    T4 = writing report\n\n\n       | T1| T2| T3| T4\n    --------------------   \n    A1 | X | X |   | X |\n    --------------------\n    A2 | X | X | X | X |\n    --------------------\n    A3 |   | X |   | X |\n    --------------------\n    A4 | X |   | X |   |\n    --------------------\n</code></pre>\nWorking on a single desktop, there are two ways to manage windows. Minimization is focused on individual windows. In terms of the table above, minimization manages windows on the level of the individual cell.<p>The other way to manage windows is show/hide, which operates on the rows of the table. You tell Safari, for instance, to hide all of its windows.<p>What is missing is window management oriented toward the columns of the table. At any given instance I am working on one of my four tasks. I want to see all of the windows associated with that task, and do not need to see the windows for the other tasks (and often specifically do not want to see them as they are distracting).<p>This is where virtual desktops should be ideal. Use one desktop per task, and switch between desktops when switching tasks. The problem is that most (all?) implementations I've seen of virtual desktops do not sufficiently isolate the desktops. For instance, the ""next window"" functionality supported in many apps will switch to windows on different desktops.<p>What I want is for each desktop to be largely independent of the others. I want to be able to cycle through windows, alt-tab between apps, and use ""hide"", ""hide others"", or ""show all"" and have it only apply to the windows on that desktop.",1297525090

I thought thats what memory fences are for.<p>--<p>I admit to having a (single) volatile varibale in my C++ codebase, used similarly to the pseudocode below:<p><pre><code>    volatile global bool flag = false; // [1]\n\n    thread1 {\n        while (whatever) {\n            do stuff\n        }\n        flag = true;\n        thread2.wait();\n    }\n    \n    thread2 {\n        while (!flag) { // [2]\n            do stuff\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre>\n[1] The variable itself is global, because I read someplace that the C/C++ standard does not allow local volatile variables to be passed to other threads. Logically, this makes sense, if a local goes out of scope before the second thread is finished with it. In my code this cannot happen, but I still make it global anyway.<p>[2] The important part is that this read is very fast unless the flag has been set (at which point I no longer care about efficiency). I don't mind if this is unsynchronized - if the loop runs an extra few iterations, that is perfectly fine, as long as the flag change is seen eventually (realistically, within a few iterations of the loop). I know that volatile only makes sure the compiler doesn't cache the value in registers and does not mean that the value will be synced or flushed or otherwise ensure it is visible by the other thread. On x86 at least, it will be, eventually.<p>My logic for using it in this way is as follows:<p>I do not care about synhronization - if the reader sees a stale value of flag, that is fine, as long as it sees the real value <i>at some point in the future</i>. I use volatile, because otherwise the compiler could simply cache the flag in a register completely isolated form the other thread. I also don't mind if the read is reordered, as long as it is within the loop and the value is used as the loop temrination condition (from what I read on the Intel site[3], the above code guarantees this - but the read may be reordered to appear elsewhere WITHIN the loop instead. This is perfectly fine in my case). I do need the write to appear AFTER the loop in thread1 and before the wait, however - again, afaik I don't need to do anything here, or should I put an sfence before the flag=true to be safe? Since I don't care about performance in the flag is true case, I don't mind adding memory fences in this case.<p>I wonder if somebody can let me know if my logic is off here (though it works on x86 and x86-64 and, accoridng to something I read on the Intel site[3], is a reasonable approach - however, I may port to ARM at some stage, in which case I will need to re-evaluate this code). My aim here is that the reader always reads the flag from the processor cache, so that its fast, but when the writer sets the flag, the cache is synced over the core interconnect and the second thread will, at some stage, see the new value.<p>Is this approach reasonable? Is it safe? I believe it is, but..<p>[3] <a href=""http://software.intel.com/en-us/blogs/2007/11/30/volatile-almost-useless-for-multi-threaded-programming/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://software.intel.com/en-us/blogs/2007/11/30/volatile-al...</a> Tenth comment down, posted by ""spud"".",1297523656

The Anybot is so expensive because it's a first generation kind of device manufactured in low volumes, and probably uses high end cameras or PLCs. $500 is a more reasonable cost, and I expect that if a large company mass produced them then the manufacturing cost would be much lower (similar to Kinect Vs other laser/TOF sensors).",1297523339

Reaction was tepid at best, Valve went back and basically re-made the entire game (delaying an already delayed game for substantially longer), but ultimately resulting in an award-winning game with an amazing (for the time) new engine. The pirating of the leak was of course highly illegal, but you could easily argue that Valve wouldn't be where they are now without it. (Half-Life 2 also contributed to the success of the Steam download service, another first for the company.)",1297523055

8738227,comment,8737292,8738024,0,0,ScottBurson,,,"Thanks for the numbers.  I agree that 3-5% doesn&#x27;t necessarily seem too low.  And of course the stats don&#x27;t show the number of indictments that were not sought because the prosecutor didn&#x27;t think they had enough evidence even for a grand jury.<p>Still, the &quot;ham sandwich&quot; comment disturbs me.  Do you think it has no basis in reality?  Considering the emphasis we put on adversarial proceedings in this country, does it not seem odd and potentially problematic that grand juries hear only one side?",1418349555

Critical thinking is more about rooting out your own biases than picking apart things said by other people (I would consider that to be just having an argumentative nature).<p>Someone who has a hair trigger for jumping on other people when they say things that they disagree with is actually applying the opposite of critical thinking- they&#x27;re not only not questioning their own beliefs, but they&#x27;re trying to impose them on someone else.",1418349531

8738089,comment,8737559,8737559,0,0,Mz,,,"<i>Incidentally, I think this in part explains why the Hacker School community is so much more positive than the world at large: People come here firstly to learn new things, not to dispute them. This suggests an interesting question: Could you build a site like Hacker News with a community focused on learning above all else?</i><p>Sigh.<p>I have no idea how big this Hacker School community is, but I imagine it is a good bit smaller than the traffic one sees on Hacker News. It is much, much, much easier to have a &quot;positive&quot; atmosphere when you have a community of under roughly 150 active members. I have seen stats that suggest that Internet forums typically have about 10% of the community very active and another 10% intermittently active and the rest lurkers. So, my experience has been that at around 700 members or so, you hit that roughly 150 mark of active members, above which you start seeing spin off communities, sub-communities and so on as some of the ways the community copes with having exceeded normal human bandwidth for community-making (based on the size of some brain part, etc).<p>This post strikes me as being written by someone who has zero appreciation for the sheer scale of Hacker News. It felt a LOT more like a real community when I initially joined it several years ago. In recent months, it seems to me it is a bit more female-friendly, and I suspect there are multiple reasons why it is evolving in that direction. So there are some good points and bad points, but it seems it has not managed to return to that same sense of community it once had.<p>The fact of the matter is that in all of human history, being able to bring together so very many people from such diverse backgrounds in real time is unprecedented. It should hardly shock people that this involves a high degree of friction and a fundamental need to invent new ways to interact, new cultural paradigms that have some hope of keeping things in that zone of warm sense of community. I think Hacker News is a victim of it&#x27;s own success. It&#x27;s sheer scale and level of traffic make this challenging. That doesn&#x27;t mean it cannot be done. But that does mean it is kind of crappy to thump your own chest and brag about your pet theory as to why your undoubtedly much smaller community is running more smoothly at this time than Hacker News.",1418347221

We cannot deny that many people write negative comments for less than healthy reasons, and that many others suffer psychologically as a result of such comments.<p>As a society, on the other hand, negative comments are indispensible for maintaining a balanced conversation, protecting human rights, and generally improving the state of our civilization.<p>> <i>Western culture trains us to disagree as part of learning to be critical thinkers.</i><p>And that&#x27;s one of the most important reasons why liberal democracy has such a hard time taking root in other cultures.<p>In (idealized) Western courtrooms, it&#x27;s the job of each attorney to try to tear apart every single thing that the other attorney says. It&#x27;s unpleasant, of course. It often wastes time and resources. But it&#x27;s the only way we&#x27;ve found so far to make sure that the process as a whole reaches a balanced conclusion. It&#x27;s our worst solution except all the others.<p>Like the market economy, the power of this process comes from the fact that it harnesses the power of human selfishness for the greater good. Really, it&#x27;s genius. The system is not only fault-tolerant (where &quot;fault&quot; means moral fault), it actually thrives on the faults of its participants.<p>A society that treats negative comments as a taboo will stagnate and go corrupt. Because you can&#x27;t eliminate selfishness, cynicism, and blind spots from human nature. To pretend that such traits don&#x27;t exist, or even worse, to try to suppress them, is bound to fail. (Yeah, we tried that with human sexuality.) The only solution is to acknowledge that we are often selfish, cynical, and partially blind, and to channel that energy into productive use.<p>> <i>writing negative comments feels good: It exercises our critical thinking skills without challenging anything we hold dear ... pointing out all the places other people are wrong rarely teaches us anything.</i><p>Exactly. And when I do that, it&#x27;s YOUR job to challenge what I hold dear by exercising your critical thinking skills. At the end of the day, we can both learn! The more we do this to one another, the better it will be for all of us. Learning by criticism is not an individual task, it&#x27;s a social project.<p>Of course, some people can&#x27;t handle this. Ever been to DeviantArt? Everybody there praises everyone else&#x27;s work all the time, no matter how shitty it is. Given the delicate sensibilities of a certain demographic that frequents DeviantArt, this policy probably saves lives. But should we all act like emo teenagers just because some of us behave like emo teenagers?",1418346387

Gun control generally is something a lot of Brits just default to thinking is a necessary thing, while not actually having considered it in much depth. (This is largely a reflex to the Dunblane incident, and they can&#x27;t understand why anyone would disagree with the resulting course of action).<p>The thing is both sides are kind of wrong. London has far more gun crime than much of the US does (personally I ran into three firearms incidents without trying) which really should provoke much more soul searching in the UK than it does (they delude themselves into thinking the whole US is uniformly dangerous), however, British cops, while by no means perfect, are enormously less likely to be in aggressive by default mode. Obviously it does happen quite a bit, but nothing like the same antagonism that you have in North America.",1418346367

8738036,comment,8737559,8737559,0,0,robert_tweed,,,"Of course comments are going to be mostly negative. Including this one.<p>HN doesn&#x27;t really have a problem with vacuous comments like &quot;this is great&quot; or &quot;this is shit&quot; which are equally as bad as each other since they add nothing of value. Those get downvoted. Commenters shouldn&#x27;t be putting people down without saying anything constructive, but it&#x27;s not our job to bolster anyone&#x27;s ego with boundless support and positivity either.<p>The main purpose of comments is to provide criticism, or point out things that are similar that others might be interested in as a follow-up on a good article.<p>As a result that&#x27;s going to come across as either negative (picking holes, focusing on what&#x27;s wrong - since that&#x27;s what criticism mainly consists of), or derisory (this isn&#x27;t new, here&#x27;s a bunch of similar stuff). In both cases there may not be any intention of malice or even a negative tone to the comment, but unless the author sugar-coats everything by adding weasel phrases like &quot;this is awesome but...&quot;, it&#x27;s going to come across as negative by default.<p>Comments can also contain questions, which can often read as criticism/negativity. E.g. &quot;why does this exist when there is already Foo?&quot;. How one chooses to interpret comments like these is up to the reader. I find it&#x27;s best to give everyone the benefit of the doubt. Never attribute to malice that which can be attributed to poor communication.<p>It&#x27;s always nice to see or be able to comment along the lines of &quot;this is awesome and here&#x27;s why it&#x27;s awesome&quot; in a way that the explanation adds some value. But usually it&#x27;s just redundant fluff and more ego stroking.<p>The reason these comments are less common isn&#x27;t because western culture is broken, the education system is broken, or because the illuminati wants to oppress us by keeping us all demotivated. It&#x27;s just because the opportunity for insightful, positive comments is much rarer than the opportunity for insightful, negative comments.<p>Positivity is nice and all, but I&#x27;d rather have zero comments than waste my time reading dozens of &quot;this is great&quot; me-too comments. Insightfulness is a million times more important than positivity.<p>It&#x27;s not about people showing off how clever they are, it&#x27;s about commenters doing what commenters are supposed to do: provide commentary and criticism that <i>adds value</i>. If you want to immerse yourself in positive comments, there are plenty of Reddit circlejerks that do just that. HN is not that. If you think HN is negative, try reading Slashdot for a month instead. You&#x27;ll appreciate just how good HN comments really are when you come back.<p>The system works. Mostly.",1418346264

Does your product demand extremely high availability with the further constraint that you can't just shift the workload to another machine to perform an OS (or application) upgrade?  If so what are the circumstances?  (e.g., Does your program maintain long-running connections that can't be broken?)   Are there times when you have been unable to upgrade your OS or server program because you couldn't sacrifice availability?<p>I'd love to get in touch with people who are working under these constraints.",1280271501

1553009,comment,1552678,1552678,0,0,malkia,,,"Cool. Correct me if I'm wrong, this is how I think the article describes it:
  - Stop the machine (one cpu running, the other ones are stopped).
  - Verify in all thread stacks whether the address range of the ""C"" function to be patched (begining to the end) to be patched is not referenced in the stack - e.g. if some function have to return to the said one (there might be false positives).
  - Put the new code in a free memory for execution. Change the first 5 bytes (x86) of the old function with JMP to the new function (granted the function should be at least 5 bytes).<p>Function changes that won't work:
  - Change to the function return type.
  - Change to the function argument list.<p>Things to be aware of:
  - If the same function is to be patched again, then you should check the stack for all pervious versions of the function (the stack might be in the old function, doing a JMP to a newer version that's doing another JMP to a newer function, etc.).<p>What else I might be missing?<p>Still don't know how they deal with data structures...<p>In Common Lisp, one can update CLOS objects, but these beasts are full of metadata, and only the compiler knows the inner parts.<p>Still quite interresting.",1280271112

Alcohol is also present in colognes, and that's <i>well</i> known to have all sorts of bad effects at large dosages.<p>I'm also skeptical of the even broader claim that exposure to phthalates is why one in five couples is infertile. Infertility has a zillion different causes, from Robertsonian translocations to endometreosis, and is a common human problem dating back to antiquity (see, for instance, the Bible, where every second woman is apparently infertile, at least until God shows up).",1280270577

1552955,comment,1551121,1551121,0,0,cflowers,,,"I think you're making a common mistake, one I made for the first 30-ish years of my life. You believe that we consciously choose which things bring us happiness and inner satisfaction. So you have consciously chosen a whole set of goals and a ""timetable"" to hold yourself accountable against.<p>But step back a second. Think about something you really love. Did you <i>choose</i> to love it, or did you merely <i>discover</i> you loved it. I remember in 7th grade, someone brought a Trash-80 to show and tell at school, and I was suddenly obsessed. Ever since then, I've learned new programming languages on my own and built stuff. But the key insight is this ... <i></i>I DID NOT CHOOSE TO LIKE PROGRAMMING<i></i>. I merely <i>discovered</i> that I happen to love it.<p>The same is true for millions of other things, from whether or not you like onions, to whether you prefer beaches or mountains, to whether you're introverted or extroverted.<p>When I was your age, I thought I wanted to build up a little real estate portfolio by converting my personal residences to rentals (aka, ""leap-frogging""). The idea felt prestigious and had a feasible chance at leading to wealth. But it turns out, I <i>HATE</i> managing real estate. I just want to focus on my software projects. Owning a rental property is just a way for me to buy myself a bunch of hassle.<p>So the point is this ... life is not <i>completely</i> about consciously setting tasks, deadlines, and goals for yourself. In fact, <i>much more</i> of life is about <i>listening</i> to your inner self, finding out more about what really makes you tick, and then steering your life more in that direction as you learn. There's an element of excitement to it, because you don't really know exactly where it will lead. Take time to get away from the hustle and bustle and reflect on your life, always asking, ""What do I want more of in my life? What do I want less of? What changes can I make that will move me in the right direction?""<p>To do this, you have to get free of the ""hold yourself accountable"" mindset. You do not have to meet anyone's standards, you don't have to achieve anything, and you don't have to prove anything. Your life is yours and yours alone. It was given to you, and you are the absolute sovereign over it. If you truly find happiness from surfing the internet 12 hours a day, then you should do it every day of your life, with no guilt whatsoever. The only reason that's not a good idea is that it won't truly make you happy. So you reflect on that, and decide to make a change that takes you in a better direction. Guilt and shame are not in the picture. Neither is time pressure, or needing to ""hold yourself accountable"". Merely self-acceptance, and leisurely looking for ways to increase the satisfaction and self-actualization you get from life.",1280269835

The integer part of the new object will be the sum of the cardinalities of the sets. The set part of the new object will be the union of the two sets with all the letters shifted as many places as specified by the integer part of the second TIAM object.<p>Example 1: [1, {a,b,c}] + [2, {c, d}] = [cardinal({a,b,c}) + cardinal({c,d}), {a,b,c}U{c,d}>>2] = [3+2,{a,b,c,d}>>2] = [5, c,d,e,f]<p>Example 2: [0,{z}] + [1, {}] = [cardinal({z}) + cardinal({}), {z}U{}>>1] = [1+0,{z}>>1] = [1,{a}]<p>* TIAM objects are closed under +.

It’s a great deal but does not sound too good to be true, I’ve heard horror stories in regards to short sales and don’t want to end being kicked out before the lease is up. Do you think it would be risky to go forward in renting this?<p>There are some items which you need to research before making your final decision for renting the condo.
1) What does the actual leasing agreement say in regards to if the condo is sold?
2) Where will your security deposit and if required, your last month’s rent be held? Escrow or trust account? Or with the landlord?
3) What stage of the foreclosure process is the property in? If there a final judgment has been issued by the court what is the auction date?
4) You should be fully be prepared to live in a fish bowl you will have to be willing to have the condo shown. If you do not allow to be shown then it could go into foreclosure.
5) What is the success rate of a property which is a potential short sale of actually being closed or sold? The success rate, expressed as a percentage, does vary from local area to local area.
6) How many short sales has the listing real estate agent listed and what percentage of them have succeeded in being closed or sold? Compare this percentage to the local area percentage to get some idea of the chances the property will be sold.
7) How many lien holders have liens against the property? With some condos at a minimum there will be first mortgage and the condominium association holding liens. The greater the number of lien holders, in most cases the less likely the property will be closed or sold. I have seen some condos having as many as 7 liens.<p>In order to say if it would be risky, the above questions need to be answered. Once you have obtained the answers you will be in a much better position to determine for yourself how risky the rental would be.<p>Glenn Ginsburg and A Delta Realty is providing this answer for informational purposes only and does not constitute any legal, accounting or tax advice.

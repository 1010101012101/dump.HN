Here was my approach and I got a very large pay bump as a result :)<p>Sit down and list all your projects you completed at your previous jobs. These will give you a great refresher and are going to be your talking points. Have both good and bad points ready. The bad points are for curve ball of questions like, &quot;whats you&#x27;re weak point.&quot; It will also show you can reflect and improve.<p>Go crazy lining up interviews, that&#x27;s one great thing about our industry, no shortage of companies to interview with.<p>A few hours before each interview, look at the job description for clues. You&#x27;ll pick your top three things that you feel would make you a great fit for the company based on your past experience. &quot;Need to be able to refactor&quot;, hey that&#x27;s all I did at x company for y time and of course the project was successful based on z metric.<p>That was mostly it, of course it helps to do a quick refresher of tech specific interview questions from google. This is mostly to boost your confidence and to keep you from feeling too nervous.<p>Good luck!",1430935160

And on top of the other symptoms of the disease these thoughts create their own suffering.<p>My advice is not to try to rationalize the urge. If you ask yourself the question &quot;Why do I have to kill myself?&quot; You will get answers. Bullshit answers, usually, but they don&#x27;t look that irrational because of your state of mind. And a lot of the suffering is caused by these essentially fruitless discussions.<p>Another key point is to realize the impermanence of the mind and of the self. Though it sounds like a buddhist teaching, everyone who survived suicidal ideation knows this: You enjoy live, then you don&#x27;t, then you do again.<p>The mind is never static.

Most of the people who could afford Uber either own a car or have sufficient access to public transit to their satisfaction. The rest of us slobs who have to nickle/dime our wages are stuck with less than optimal transportation regardless of Uber&#x27;s presence in the state or not. Basically, Wichita and other Kansas cities are <i>huge</i> for their population. Wichita along is about 8x7 miles if I remember right. And this excludes suburbs and outlying communities in and out of the county. KCMO is a bit more packed in from what I remember, but not by much. So, for Uber and its drivers to make money they&#x27;d need a relatively steady volume of riders to and from places of work and shopping. In Wichita, that&#x27;s pretty hard to sustain since our employment centers are split up between downtown and East/West Wichita (Cessna, Spirit, Hawker-Beech, and etc). The rest of the employers are along the northside but they&#x27;re not exactly high wage payers (Does Coleman do any work out there anymore aside from the gas bottling plant?).

That means if you buy bonds now, and interest rates shoot up, the underlying price/value of that bond will plummet.  This is especially bad if you have callable bonds, because the bond holder can call them at any time, forcing you to essentially receive the value of the bond at the time of the call - even if the price/value has plummeted due to increasing interest rates.<p>Be cautious investing in bonds, and if you do, you might consider holding them to maturity if interest rates go up and prices/value goes down (and hope they don&#x27;t get called).<p>I personally think it&#x27;s a scary time - interest rates going up will have an effect on prices of bonds, stocks, and more.

If demand drops (or even merely does not rise as quickly as expected), then the price drops. If you were relying on high prices when you made your decision to invest more money to increase capacity, then what previously looked like a good idea may now be a bad one.<p>When your break-even price is $60 to $65/barrel and prices fall below that, your net return is negative. But the best part is you don&#x27;t even get to stop producing. The costs for most oil sources must be paid largely up-front, and your marginal cost may be only $20 to $30/barrel. So when oil drops to $50/barrel, you can choose between continuing to produce at a loss of $10 to $15/barrel over the life of the well, or stop producing and suffer a much, much larger loss. That keeps supply high and prices low.<p>One oil source that does not have large up-front costs is fracking. Or, more exactly, fracking sites only last 18 months or so before production slows to a trickle, so you have a much smaller time horizon to recoup up-front costs. So the amount of fracking will very likely decline quickly. But viewed from an economy-wide standpoint, there was still plenty of malinvestment here: drilling equipment rental, trucking, rail, etc., require large capital outlays but carried high prices when oil prices and thus demand was high. As demand drops, they may not be worth the amount invested in them.",1430934163

Lack of affordable housing is such a problem in some places that police, teachers and so on often cannot afford to live in the communities they serve. These are not people who are incompetent and looking for a handout, yet some communities have to set up special programs to help them buy a house or live reasonably close to work because our housing policies are so horribly broken.<p>Maternity leave and other policies that help women get and keep jobs and pursue real careers. I read a lot about this in my twenties. In America, women pursued the American historical position of &quot;Don&#x27;t tread on me!&quot; and took the position that &quot;I can too do the job if you just get the fuck out of my way.&quot; The result is that women who are without a man and without children make about 98% of what men make who have similar education and experience. But the minute you introduce a man or a child into the picture, American women make more like 2/3s what men make -- the same figure cited in the bible as what women were worth compared to men 2000-ish years ago. In contrast, European women have pushed for help in carrying the burden of bearing and raising kids and the result has been substantially more gains in terms of closing the wage gap and overall lower divorce rates.<p>The things you are suggesting are problematic because it actively disincentivizes working.

I do hope to see something close to a drop-in coreos cluster on a number of networks that becomes easier to use in practice and on in-house servers...  The reliability is still a concern, and when you are using a PFM (pure f<i></i>*ing magic) solution, it needs to be rock solid.  I think within 1-2 years CoreOS will be a choice solution... unfortunately I can&#x27;t wait for that, and don&#x27;t have the time to become intimate with every detail therein.<p>Although etcd had a lot of issues even when I was in the evaluation stage... I setup a dev cluster, having a node running on half a dozen machines (developer workstations included) in the office.   The etcd cluster broke 3-4 times before I abandoned the thought of using it.  With the 2.x release, my test network (3 virtual servers) was a lot more reliable, but I decided I didn&#x27;t need it that much, opting to use my cloud provider&#x27;s table solution for maintaining my minimal configuration...<p>For my deployment, the cluster is relatively small, 3 nodes mainly for redunjdancy... our load could pretty easily be handled by a single larger server. That said, I decided to just use dokku-alt for deployments directly to each server (each service with two instances on each server).  To make deployments easier to use, I have internal dns setup with wildcards using v#-#-#.instance-#.service.host.domain.local as a deploy pattern for versioned targets and instance-#.service.host.domain.local for default instances. I have two nginx servers setup for ssl, spdy termination and caching configured to relay requests to the dokku cluster for user-facing services.  This is turning out to be simpler than implementing etcd/flannel for that communications layer.<p>Each instance is passed relevant information regarding the host/service information to report it&#x27;s own health to table storage, internal communication is using ZeroMQ req/res interfaces to minimize communication overhead, and allow for reconnects.  Which is working a little better than relying on WebService/REST interfaces internally.",1430933112

If you want proof of this, look no further than the leaked Sony emails doing a search for &quot;salary&quot; or &quot;compensation.&quot; Reviews, metrics, etc. are used only as justification to pay people enough not to leave, even at the highest levels of the organization. The whole process is fake. The number is usually based on salary history, compensation stats from competitors, employee complaints, or having a better offer in-hand. This creates somewhat toxic environments where the least loyal employees who whine loudest, puff up their importance, job hop, and interview strategically get the best outcomes.<p>The closest I&#x27;ve seen to pay for value is in finance or sales roles, and even that is hazy. Employees in those roles have a few things going for them:<p>1. Measurable output. A trader or salesman can point to his numbers for the year and know what he&#x27;s worth to the business. The business can see them and know what&#x27;s at stake if they deflect.<p>2. Fewer economies of scale, meaning the individual employee provides relatively more value than the firm does. The typical Google engineer can&#x27;t re-create Search from scratch, but a hedge fund trader can walk out the door with a great idea to work for a competitor. That&#x27;s great leverage.<p>3. Competitive external employment environment. If your salesmen are woefully underpaid, a rival employer will snatch them up since they can pay them more than you while still retaining a solid margin. A lot of these jobs are in &quot;winner take all&quot; economies, so employers will squeeze their margins extremely tight to win talent.<p>4. Competitive internal culture.

It was bought by a family that either had kids or was going to have kids. The average family had 2-3 kids. It had basics, like a functioning kitchen and heat in the winter.<p>By 2000, the average new home was over 2000 square feet. The average family had one child. It had all kinds of amenities, like a microwave and multiple bathrooms.<p>You seem to think, as many people do, that &quot;poor people&quot; are a separate class of people, distinct from everyone else. I was middle class most of my life.<p>I am not mentally ill. I am physically ill. Most people on the street do have some sort of mental health or medical issue or disability. The fact that the American health care system is such a mess is definitely part of the problem. The last time I looked at stats on the issue, more than half of all bankruptcies involved high medical bills. This held true even in cases where they had good insurance.<p>So fixing our health care system would help. But also removing some of the tax incentives that give tax breaks to folks who can already afford a house in a way that actively encourages them to buy the largest house they can afford, with the most amenities, would help. We need to stop dividing up the housing market between housing for rich folks and slum housing. There used to be middle class housing. That is essentially disappearing.<p>The other thing we need is more walkable communities and better public transit. America is arranged such that most people basically <i>need</i> a car in order to have a job at all. I gave up my car while still working for a Fortune 500 company and although it was about a 7-10 minute drive to work, it was an hour long walk and you basically &quot;couldn&#x27;t get there from here&quot; via public transit -- or, more accurately, it would have taken me longer to use public transit than to walk there. All of the incentive programs at work trying to encourage people to carpool and what not were heavily biased towards an assumption of everyone having a car and driving everywhere and largely worthless for someone like me.

That operation wouldn&#x27;t be worth the mental storage (and certainly not a key!) to memorize. I can&#x27;t think of the last time I would have needed it. Maybe when getting a pair of function parameters in the wrong order?<p>The example you gave wouldn&#x27;t <i>ever</i> be a program I&#x27;d write. Magic numbers? Hard-coded rendering? Rendering something that can&#x27;t be edited by an <i>artist</i>? All bad. I understand that it&#x27;s just an example, but can you come up with one that <i>would</i> be valid in production code?<p>I know you were looking for a simple example, but in addition to the comments others have made about syntax not being a big deal for an experienced developer, this looks like a helper operation for developers who are doing it wrong to begin with.<p>Aside from that, years of user-experience research shows that modal editors are worse than the alternative (if you can hit one key, that means you can&#x27;t type text in that mode; sorry vim-lovers, but it&#x27;s true).<p>Yes I tried your experiment, and I could get it down to 7 keystrokes in my editor. I type quickly, so that&#x27;s a couple of seconds at most; less than a second if I&#x27;m in the zone.

Also, if I were modifying many similar lines to change them, I have options: Refactoring tools (if we&#x27;re talking a function signature change), simple keyboard macros, or smart multi-file search-and-replace regular expression conversions.<p>And all of this in a &quot;text&quot; editor with a low barrier to entry (unlike vim OR emacs) -- though one that understands <i>some</i> structure at least.",1430932943

The latter is what most considered to be &quot;the right thing&quot; including their regulators.<p>But then the law of unintended consequences reared its ugly head, housing prices started to fall and we all realized how tied together that securitization pipeline had become.  Investors bought credit swaps on their mortgage bonds to protect their downside and move the assets off their balance sheets in order to buy more mortgage bonds—also allowing retail banks to create more mortgages, further increasing home ownership.  The companies who sold those swaps (AIG) assumed that housing prices would never fall and default rates would never rise.<p>They were wrong.<p>As soon as that black swan event happened and Bear, Lehman et al had to start marking losses on those MBS products, the market pounced.  Then AIG had to start paying those swaps but couldn&#x27;t (hence the nationalization).<p>While there were definitely bad actors (those handing out liar loans and so forth), at any individual stage in that massive, trillion-dollar pipeline, most actors were behaving in a way that rationally made sense.  Banks sought to hedge their downside by buying CDSs against their MBS products.  Insurers trusted the ratings agencies.  The ratings agencies were too weak to do anything despite internal misgivings about those MBS products (and of course the incentive structure there is all sorts of stupid).  The investment banks definitely twisted arms at the ratings agencies to get investment-grade ratings on what were truly junk bonds and that was bad on their part and arguably fraud, so yes, someone should probably be liable for that.<p>But what could&#x27;ve been done differently at the macro level to ensure that every actor in that pipeline acted in the interest of the &quot;greater good&quot; when we can&#x27;t even define what that is?  Yes, we could have tighter controls on mortgage underwriting standards but will that prevent the next crash?  How do we hold someone liable for not avoiding a crash?  We can&#x27;t even tell when a crash is coming, are we honestly going to blame someone for not being able to do the impossible?",1430932449

In the last 4½ years, PSS has delivered millions of pages for thousands of sites, all for free. While a number of sites continue to enjoy the benefits of PageSpeed Service, we see much broader adoption of PageSpeed technology through our open-source products and have therefore decided to focus our efforts on improving those.<p>Today we are announcing that PageSpeed Service will be turned off on 3rd August 2015. Users must change their DNS to point away from the service by this time, or their sites will cease to function. We have created a migration page that includes assistance for changing DNS as well as information on other ways PageSpeed technology can be employed on websites. Please see https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/service/Deprecation.<p>At the same time we are also announcing the deprecation of PageSpeed integration with Google App Engine. If you are using PageSpeed integration on Google App Engine, it will continue to function until 1st December 2015, after which PageSpeed optimizations will no-longer be applied to your app. No action is required on the part of App Engine users; after this date apps will continue to operate, except without the benefit of the PageSpeed optimisations.

A mini habit is something &quot;too small to fail&quot; that you do every day/week or every time you commit.<p>* Read through all the changes you&#x27;re going to commit. It&#x27;s amazing how much you can spot by yourself when looking at it again. For every change ask yourself, could any of the variables/parameters be in some way malicious (nil, empty, something malicious only in this context). That&#x27;s not the only thing to check, you&#x27;ll have to know other types of vulnerabilities, too. But it&#x27;s a start.<p>* If you&#x27;re in a team, you could do the same by asking coworkers for reviews and use pull-request cycles.<p>The advantage of these small steps are that you won&#x27;t need to reserve a _huge_ block of time for an audit just before release. And if you do reviews in a team, you&#x27;ll also get somewhat of an outside view on the code. That doesn&#x27;t mean of course there won&#x27;t be any vulnerabilities anymore, but it can greatly increase code quality. A professional audit will still spot more problems, but I&#x27;ve seen teams getting better and better every time they had an audit.<p>Sometimes security vulnerabilities aren&#x27;t directly visible in the code because they might only exist because of 2+ other features. For example: Many web applications allow you to change the password, but it requires to enter the old password. Now somebody adds a feature to change the email address of the user. That sounds like a normal feature. It’s secure by itself, because only the user can change her own email. So what if someone gained access to the account (a stolen session/cookie)? That means that someone could take over the entire account by changing the email address. And from there she could use the “Forgotten password” feature to create a new password which will be sent to the new email address.<p>* So in terms of habits, use some time every week on the same day and think about the bigger picture, the general security policy. And limit the time you spend on this. Otherwise you won’t want to do it next week, because it took too long last time.<p>(I wrote an article about habits and Rails security here, but it&#x27;s applicable to all languages: <a href=""http://bauland42.com/articles/a-week-with-a-rails-security-strategy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bauland42.com/articles/a-week-with-a-rails-security-s...</a> )",1430931752

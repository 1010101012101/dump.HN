I hope there will be a follow up which may go into further detail in terms of how to go about erasing.<p>The entire concept of erasing (""unthinking""?) brings to mind the dialogue between Gandalf and Saruman in Book 3, Chapter 10.  Specifically: ""Gandalf stirred, and looked up. ""What have you to say that you did not say at our last meeting?"" he asked. ""Or, perhaps, you have things to unsay?""\nSaruman paused. ""Unsay?"" he mused, as if puzzled.""",1210747965

The secret to a start up isn’t the “original idea”…it’s whether or not your founder can execute - never mind the idea.

We've all got iPhones or Blackberrys and so have been looking for online solutions which will filter the spam out before the email hits our server.  We tried one company, but they're wanting to charge us over $2000/year for this as a service and I was wondering what you do about spam?  Are there any low cost (but good) services that you would recommend similar to the above?<p>Thanks!",1210747625

189337,comment,188932,188932,0,0,daniel-cussen,,,"Sounds like the author has a classic case of ADHD.  He can't get around to things unless it's an emergency, and when it is, he gets into a hyperfocus mode.  Sadly, the hyperfocus only happens when a person with ADHD truly thinks he or she is in an emergency.  That, and ritalin.<p>Of course, a friend of mine would leave his assignments for last minute.  If an essay was due at 7 a.m. before class, he'd set his alarm clock for 5 a.m. and start the essay then.  He did well on them, too.  What amazes me is that he knew what was best for him, despite teachers who sermonized about avoiding procrastination.",1210747384

You are constantly resource constrained so you must figure out how to maximize efficiency , whatever that may be in each respective case.<p>You have an idea (let's assume it is a good one for simplicities sake) but lack the ability to implement. This naturally brings up the question of how to implement - you can learn to do it yourself or hire someone to do it for you. Hire may mean trading equity for the ""co-founder's"" time or compensating them monetarily. If you cannot afford to hire (try elance, guru, etc) you are left with trading equity. This means that you must now convince someone that you are competent to direct the implementation process (""you bring something to the table"").<p>This is meant to be a pretty straightforward explanation because your question is vague in the sense that the situation you allude to has multitudes of variables.",1210746501

189326,comment,189260,189260,0,0,inovica,,,"I majored in Business (with marketing) in 1994. The one thing I learned from business school was problem solving. When I accidentally became involved in software, and more later web apps, it was obvious to me that I needed to learn to code at least to the point where I could converse about it.  This ended up being one of the best things I've done and I garnered more respect from the team by doing so. My not being able to code was an obstacle - a problem - that was overcome by rolling my sleeves up. And guess what, I enjoyed it and still do to this day.",1210746189

189322,comment,189065,189227,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"Here's the libertarian take:<p>There are lots of things we aren't free to say, such as shouting fire in a theatre, threatening others, etc. But they all come down to measurable harm. As the Wikipedia article you linked says, they are ""directed to and likely to incite imminent lawless action."" It's unquestionable that we as a society have a right to censor if the person's speech has no artistic value and causes physical harm to others, because in so doing, they violate other people's civil liberties, which is what the law is designed to protect. It's the same as murder, though to a lesser degree.<p>So for swearing on television to fall into the same category as shouting fire, it would have to be proven to harm others. There's no evidence that this is the case whatsoever, let alone proof, or even a rational argument. Thus there should be no FCC censorship.",1210745769

Okay, suppose you did the arithmetic bit serially, like the PDP-8S? A 32-bit floating-point multiply you have to multiply two 24-bit significands, that's going to take 600 time steps. For the additions, a logarithmic number of shifts, each will take 24 time steps...It turned out that a floating-point add would take about 1/2 a millisecond and a multiply a millisecond. Sounds terrible, but you've got 64,000 processors.<p>Dr Dobb's Journal: So you could do 64,000 of these calculations in a millisecond.<p>Steele: That's up in the range of 100 million operations a second, equivalent to a Cray 1, which was the supercomputer of the day. So after the lecture, I went up to Danny and said, ""You said this is a terrible numeric machine, but I can tell it's approximately the equivalent of a Cray 1."" And he replied, ""Can we have dinner tonight?""",1210745649

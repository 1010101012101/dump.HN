</code></pre>
Yes, and now, I'd argue, they are even faster. Unfortunately, I am not aware of any good studies about meme transmission rate-- it's the sort of thing that is difficult to measure without affecting the meme in the process of measuring. Data from a botnet would be ideal.<p><pre><code>  > The thing is, memes reflect a community's insider aspect. If you

</code></pre>
This is of course true. But don't forget that much social behavior is about fitting-in better with ones peers. It's a signal that says ""I belong here"" or ""We are a part of the same tribe"". Again, not unique to the internet at all. It's just much faster lately.<p><pre><code>  > usually aren't funny or clever beyond being repetitive, so don't

</code></pre>
I don't claim to have a complete theory of humor, but a big part of what makes something funny is repetition coupled with subtle changes in the pattern. Many memes, especially of the ytmnd or 4chan variety, tap into this to great effect. I can think of more than a couple which I thought were uninteresting in their original presentation that became outstanding after several iterations.<p>Also, note how many memes use self-reference and absurdity. This is the essence of post-modernism. Again, this is nothing new, but memes certainly allow exposure of these themes to a very broad audience.<p>Finally, with respect to your assertion that ""very rarely is a meme used alongside relevant information,"" I note that your own post contradicts this.",1253800427

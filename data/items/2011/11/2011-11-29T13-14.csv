3290281,comment,3289839,3290126,2,0,iliis,,,"Ah, sorry, I misunderstood your question.<p>You are asking, why the information ""one is born on Tuesday"" says anything about the gender or birthday of the other, right?<p>More specificaly, this:<p>> <i>Let us first assume that it is the older child who was a son born on a Tuesday. In this case the second child could be either of two sexes, and could have been born on any of seven days of the week, for a total of 14 possibilities.<p>> Now let's suppose it is the younger child who was a son born on a Tuesday. Then the older child could, again, be either of two sexes and could have been born on any of seven days of the week, again providing 14 possibilities. Added to our original 14 that would seem to give 28 possibilities.<p>> But be careful! One possibility got counted twice. Specifically, the one where both children are boys born on Tuesdays. So really there are only 27 possibilities. And since 13 of them involve the second child being a boy, the probability would be 13/27</i>.<p>Maybe it helps, if you first imagine <i>all</i> 196 (2 * 2 * 7 * 7, think of four 7-by-7 tables [draw them, it helps a lot ;)]) possibilities. Eliminate 49 of them where both are girls (one of the four tables) and you have 147 possibilities/cells left. Then, in each of the two BG and GB tables leave only one row/column, eg. eliminating another 2 * 6 * 7=84 possibilities.<p>Now comes the interesting/tricky part:
The last case/table, where both are boys contains only 13 possible cases (instead of 2 * 7)! Imagine a 7-by-7 table, where each row and column corresponds to a day. Mark all the cells which are not in a Tuesday-row or a Tuesday-column, eg. eliminate all posibilities where none of the two boys are born on a Tuesday. This eliminates another 49-13=36 cases.<p>So, we have a total of 196-49-84-36=27 cases, 13 of which ""the other is a boy"" and 3/27=1/9 cases where ""the other is born on a tuesday"".<p>I hope this makes somewhat sense. Once I've drawn all the possibilities and marked all the impossible ones, it became a lot clearer.",1322575186

Reading this from a female perspective he was just telling facts, and I don't see this as HR's problem either. We women need to learn to negotiate, and learn how to do this while maintaining the need for social inclusion. There are still a lot more men in the tech business which does affect the manner in which you discuss money and it's hard even for me to negotiate (and I've been in business for years). It's a matter of telling your social-brain to shut up and put your personal-survival-brain first, maybe.<p>I don't see this as a gender issue so much as a personality-type issue, it's secondary that many women happen to have the personality-type where social concerns come first. When clients ask me for a discount we'll almost always give it, but I'll be much happier to work with a client who approaches the matter in a sociable way rather than a direct request for a discount (I find it tasteless, even though the money-brain side of me completely understands what is happening).<p>Just a side note: I have male employees who also suck at asking for raises.",1322574938

Sure they may complain about being underpaid, but few will move to another job.<p>I remember in my previous job, I had a senior sysadmin who had been with the company for 10 years and earning $70k ... we were hiring new sysadmins off the street for $100k. He complained about it and I tried everything I could to get him a payrise because he was a good performer - but company policy was that pay rises could not be more than 10% without exec approval. So the best I could offer him was $77k - in my justification for more, I compared market rates, how much it would cost the company if we had to replace him ($100k in salary alone let alone recruitment costs) etc  - but the reply back from HR was 'we bet he won't leave'. And sure enough he didn't. It really saddened me - the fact is he could get a job elsewhere that paid way more, but he was too 'comfortable' in his position.<p>In my experience, people tell themselves all sort of stories why they don't leave - I'm still learning lots, I like the people I work with, I need a little more experience etc - all of this may be true to a degree, but going by the number that complain about being overworked/underpaid, a lot of them simply are excuses.<p>Companies know and understand this - and hence people often may get underpaid.",1322574768

The worst I've ever done is not offer more than the initial offer.<p>There's almost always wiggle room - personally I've never accepted the first offer, and typically I've gotten 30%-50% more. Conversely, because I know there are people like me out there, I <i>never</i> offer the maximum I'm ready to pay - nobody has ever just quietly walked away if the offer wasn't good enough.<p>The only exception would be if I was hiring for specific very high level talent when the market is totally overheated.<p>> That's why I like recruitment agents, when you apply for a job, you already know the salary (or at least the salary range)<p>Recruiters are not your friends. While it is in their interest to get you the highest salary possible because it increases their commission, it is also in their interest to hire as many people as possible in as little time as possible, which means getting you to accept a lower offer if that's the quickest way there.<p>I am not saying not to use recruiters - I have successfully gotten got jobs via recruiters - but be <i>very</i> clear with them about salary expectations, and remember that just because a recruiter is involved does not mean the offer isn't negotiable.<p>On the contrary, if, when you get an offer, you make it clear you need more to accept right away, they <i>will</i> bat for you because they want that commission. Conversely, realize that they <i>will</i> at the same time bat for the employer if they think they can get you to sign right away. What matters to them is which side is most likely to cave.<p>Be nice to a recruiter and they also often <i>will</i> give you an indication of how far the potential employer is likely to stretch. I've several times had recruiters tell me ""the instruction we got says X to Y, but I think they'll stretch to Z"" where Z was a number I thought would've been outrageous to even ask for. In one of those cases, the company did in fact come back with an offer of Z after some strong hints + a very significant (far above normal levels) guaranteed raise at a specific later time.<p>Do practice interviews.

They've got thousands upon thousands of good reviews. As a result, they never price themselves the cheapest, but maybe pretty close to that. Their script finds the cheapest price, makes sure that it's above their cost, and then prices it at 15% above the cheapest.<p>Seller 2 is not as entrenched in the market. They try to undercut their competitors. They have good reviews, but not as many reviews over all. So, price is their main weapon. Their script seeks out well reviewed sellers and prices at 5% below their competitor.<p>Both scripts update every 15 minutes or so. You can see where this is going if both scripts don't have an upper bound. Each script is designed to make the most profit, and not be the lowest by too far. For example, if pencils suddenly had a shortage, you'd want your prices to automatically raise to match the perceived demand. You wouldn't want to be the sucker who sells all his pencils at a tiny profit while everyone else gets far more money.<p>Or, you know, it could just be a data input error. :p",1322573449

If you were ordering from CAT (the big published book that 98% of orders came from, and you said the magic words -- canonically, ""Can you do anything about lowering the price?""  -- I would tell you that we had a competitive bidding process and, if you'd give me one second, the computer would come up with our best competitive bid for your business <i>deletes CAT, writes BID</i> ahh, I see we can knock 10% off the order)<p>There was actually a Bids group, but you'd have to be ordering office paper by the truckload (literally -- some people do) to be worth their attention.  The folks in charge of things had long since decided that it was cheaper to just give 10% to anyone who asked than to involve the folks in Bids on $400 accounts or lose business because a law firm secretary decided to do price shopping prior to placing her order.<p>Of particular note: there is literally nothing you can say, starting from ""You're placing an order in CAT"", that would cause you to pay more money than the CAT prices.

You should not be going in blind. Also do research on how much people are making at a role that is similar to yours in terms of work / title / experience. Remember that if there are 2 same positions at a company or even in a department or a team, difference between their salaries could be big.<p>If you're asked to divulge salary history, don't tip your hand. I've made this mistake a couple of times and I have regretted it / having had to settle for a lower salary. If insist on you giving them a number, quote a number that's 10-15% higher than your annual salary (Have to be careful of the company not finding out your current salary through some other means).<p>Always tell them about the value you bring to their organization and your experience and that you deserve this much $ amount because of how much the future company will benefit from your skills. Talk about positive recommendations & performance reviews, performance bonuses, awards & accolades you've earned at your current/ past jobs or at school. Do not bring in a comparative number (this company is offering me this much) unless you really need to as it sort of casts a negative impression about you being all about money. Potray how highly you're  interested in the position but you feel that the offer is on a conservative side as far as the market rate goes.<p>If they cannot offer a higher $$$ figure, and you really like the profile, you can negotiate better benefits like full health coverage vs. partial, higher # of vacation days (some companies allow you to cash out some vacation days at the end of the year), commuter benefits, etc.<p>Just be confident and do not hesitate to ask for more (as long as it's realistic and comparable to the going rate).

3290152,comment,3289839,3289839,7,0,reitzensteinm,,,"I've been thinking about this for an hour, and I'm now convinced that the author is wrong. The fact that we found out about one of the children <i>from the father</i> means that all probabilities are not equal, even though they're treated here like they are.<p>The difference is between the information being offered, and determined independantly. I'll do this with the boy/girl problem, for simplicities sake.<p>If we ask a man if he has at least one boy, and he says yes, we can work out the chance the other child is a boy like so:<p>Assume all four possibilities are equally likely:<p><pre><code>   BB
   BG
   GB
   GG
</code></pre>
If we ask him if he has at least one boy, and he says yes, we effectively filter off GG, which brings the list down to:<p><pre><code>   BB
   BG
   GB
</code></pre>
Therefore, the chance of the other child being a boy is 1/3. Pretty straight forward.<p>However! Because the father offered the information on his own, it effectively turns it into the author's other problem, where the older child is a boy, find out the gender of the younger child.<p>The trick is that he's equally likely to give information about either of his children, therefore there are eight possibilities:<p>He gives information about child A:<p><pre><code>   BB - B
   BG - B
   GB - G
   GG - G
</code></pre>
He gives information about child B:<p><pre><code>   BB - B
   BG - G
   GB - B
   GG - G
</code></pre>
There are still 3 possibilities, but BB is twice as likely as the others, because if both children are a boy he's definitely going to reveal the gender of one of them as a boy; whereas if one is a girl and one is a boy, there's only a 50% chance he will.<p><pre><code>   BB - 50%
   GB - 25%
   BG - 25%
</code></pre>
So, the answer to this:<p><i>You meet a man on the street and he says, I have two children and one is a son born on a Tuesday. What is the probability that the other child is also a son?</i><p>Is 1/2<p>The answer to this:<p><i>A man has two children, and one is a son born on a Tuesday. What is the probability that the other child is also a son?</i><p>Is 13/27<p>It's nitpicky, but I think the author should be very exact about this kind of thing, since he's trying to clear things up.",1322572577

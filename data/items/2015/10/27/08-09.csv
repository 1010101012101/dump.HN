I&#x27;m carrying the analogy from paper sizes: A4, A5, A1, etc.<p>So probably we would have gotten this wrong when we first defined them (see iPhone aspect changes), but presumably after a while they settle down and then we can stop testing for the old aspect ratios.<p>Monitors, laptops, tablets, phones, would all standardise to a set of options just like most books and magazines standardise to a given size.<p>I know there are downsides, but imagine how much easier this would be for designers. Cross-platform UI design would be much simpler.<p>Just a radical thought I had.",1445936389

10456906,comment,10455735,10455735,0,0,devit,,,"The root problem seems to be that the web security model is broken because you can get onload AND onerror callbacks from img coming from 3rd party sources regardless of CORS.<p>You are not allowed to read the content of those resources for security reasons, and the fact that you can detect whether they have been loaded seems just as broken (although obviously this usually only has privacy impact, while reading the contents easily allows impersonating the user or stealing secrets).<p>This attack abuses this by using HTTP URLs and causing HTTPS to trigger onerror by using a content security policy that disallow HTTPS, which allows to measure timing of the HTTP->HTTPS redirection, which is instantaneous if the site had already been visited due to HSTS caching.<p>So I think two changes are needed:<p>1. The browser should never fire onerror on non-CORS-allowed 3rd party resources, but instead fire onload even if an error happens<p>2. The onload event should ideally be triggered 1 second after the resource has been seen regardless of whether it has been loaded or not. If that breaks too many websites, the timing granularity should be rounded to the greatest period possible.<p>There is also the problem of lots websites having CORS policies that allow * , so should probably also fix browsers to not allow sites to have CORS * policies, at least for this purpose.<p>Alternatively, it might be possible to load those resources normally, but effectively consider them to be a &quot;3rd party origin from 1st party origin&quot; that is different from &quot;3rd party origin&quot; and from other 1st party origins for all caching purposes.<p>However, this seems risky because if the 3rd party site manages to somehow fingerprint the user (e.g. because the IP address is whitelisted) then that information is potentially leaked to the 1st party site. For example, it would be possible to detect whether your IP is whitelisted by a domain that otherwise returns errors to everyone.",1445936331

The gist of it is that BCS theory, which satisfactorily explains conventional superconductivity, fails to predict the behaviour of high-temperature superconductors, and there simply isn&#x27;t a better model available at the moment.<p>For any sane individuals reading this, the answer is &quot;We&#x27;re trying really hard but so far we haven&#x27;t been able to deduce a formula for the highest temperature.&quot;<p>I&#x27;m not very optimistic with regards to this ever happening.

Hiding a problem tends to make it worse because it&#x27;s easy to ignore it, and easy to make it much worse.<p>Compound selectors are necessary for context-dependent styling; and all compound selectors are context dependent.  Nesting is equivalent.  However, context dependency makes it harder to reason about a layout, makes it harder to refactor, and makes it harder to reuse parts elsewhere.<p>DRY-ness is vastly overrated in all programming languages; what matters is composability.  You&#x27;re not writing a compressor.  DRY is simply a means to an end; being DRY helps composability because it means that changes to one part of your program don&#x27;t necessitate changes to the repetitive parts elsewhere.  If you <i>need</i> to extract that commonality - of course, do so! But it&#x27;s much better if you can delete it outright, and in the case of SASS nesting that&#x27;s almost always the case.<p>For another perspective: every composition in a selector is essentially a nested if in the &quot;program&quot; that is your styles. Do you really need nested ifs all over the place?  If someone changes the html structure a bit, are they going to be surprised by which styles match if they fails to keep the styles side-by-side?  If you&#x27;re nesting styles, your styles are likely extremely tightly coupled with your html structure, and any changes that don&#x27;t in details dovetail with changes to the styles will cause unpredictable consequences.  If you&#x27;re going to do that, consider something like [radium](<a href=""http://projects.formidablelabs.com/radium/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://projects.formidablelabs.com/radium/</a>) - i.e. inline styles.

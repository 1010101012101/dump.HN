I've seen simple sites that were also beautiful. The design isn't what really matter on HN, though. The community is what's beautiful, so I can ignore the fairly uninspired design.",1261655786
1013707,comment,1013470,1013693,0,0,viraptor,,,"Wicd seems to solve all of the problems you listed here. Unfortunately distros seem to push their own broken or feature-lacking interfaces instead of adopting and extending this one (ubuntu, looking at you). It will not reconnect you to a network with a stronger signal automatically unless you lose the connection though - which I think is a good solution, because you don't want to be disconnected at 99% of some big download, just because the signal level changed (without actually disconnecting you).<p>But I agree... the state of distro-default applications for both ppp-based 3G and serious wifi is disappointing. I needed wvdial to connect to O2-uk. Not because it was impossible with gnome-ppp, but because only wvdial gave me enough debug information to figure out why I couldn't connect the first time.",1261655723

I'm talking about the ones who make magic happen on a regular basis. The go-to guys of the department. There are certain levels of sysadmins whom you can find who may not know your company's particular flavor of Linux that will still pick it up quickly because they grok the entirety of the ""unix"" mindset.<p>It's difficult to grok the entirety of that mindset, however, with experience in only a handful of Linux distributions.<p>I've worked with a few folks like this, and they aren't hamfisted, show-off rebels like a rock star.

</code></pre>
Duality is at the core of modern Physics. Back to the 1600s, Christiaan Huygens and Isaac Newton were debating about the Nature of Light: Huygens thought Light was consisting of Wave, Newton thought it was composed of Particles. Nobody at that time could ever think that both were right when Quantum Mechanics asserted the Wave-Particle Duality.<p>How Geeks can understand this ? Imagine a ...",1261654677

1013697,comment,1013545,1013602,0,0,andrew1,,,"I think I'd argue that this _is_ analogous to academia (well at least to mathematics). Take Fermat's Last Theorem for example, it's commonly accepted that Andrew Wiles proved the Theorem. However, without the work and results of thousands of other mathematicians throughout history he almost certainly could not have done so. The credit to those people is given within the proof; ""combining the results of X with Y's theorem..."" not in an enormous list on the front page. Equally, the name Google goes on the advertisements but within source code and blogs and bug fixes part of the credit goes to the technology that Chrome is built on.",1261654420

I wouldn't want to send ~4.3GB for every deployment. Furthermore, a quick deployment time is valuable when a crucial fix needs to be pushed to production.<p>This is not to mention the space that your 300MB deploy is going to take up on the hard drives of your production machines if you deploy twice a day. That's over 213GB a year per machine, sounds like you would need to start deleting old revisions. Or start just sending the diffs.",1261654313

It seems to just randomly detect the wrong encryption scheme so shockingly enough my WPA key doesn't work as a WEP key, it can't figure out that if I have 5 open networks it should use the strongest signal automatically, if one of those 5 networks keeps dropping it won't pick one of the others or if DHCP fails it will just sit there doing nothing instead of trying another one of the networks. If someone could analyze how people actually use wifi and solve 90% of the most common setup problems it would be a huge boost for Linux usability.",1261654169

Very few people write Free Software out of pure altruism.  They write it because they have a problem they need to solve.  Often there is personal gain in sharing this solution with the world (reputation, free bugfixes, etc.), so people do.  This is the open source / free software movement in a nutshell.<p>If this attitude drives you away from getting something for free, then I guess that's too bad.  The community only benefits marginally from consumers; it benefits from producers.  If you are never willing to produce, the community can probably live without you.",1261653042

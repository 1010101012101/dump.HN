If Twitter went away tomorrow the people who would be hurt the most are the ones communicating out with it, not the ones consuming from it. And those are the people they are trying to monetize.<p>Think of how most of us here who work on SaaS platforms would try to monetize something like Twitter if we just thought it up today and Twitter had never existed. We&#x27;d probably put a pricing structure in place along the lines of &quot;$x/mo per million followers&quot; or &quot;$x/mo per $y tweets&quot;.<p>I know plenty of people who like Twitter and use it regularly but it&#x27;s something they check now and then and if they forget to or miss something it&#x27;s not a big deal to them.",1383843214

In fact code reviews are so beneficial that if I was working on a solo project I would either pay for them to be done or review the code myself after a suitable cooling off period, depending on what I was working on.<p>On the other hand, I have also witnessed sloppy, lazy code reviews that catch nothing except the occasional typo. This amounts to an unjustifiable waste of time. Fortunately, it is easy to tell a good code reviews from bad by tracking defect discovery and digging into review comments as needed.<p>One thing that code review catches that <i>nothing else does</i> is code that is poorly written but functional (i.e. passing tests).<p>The example I always trot out is<p><pre><code>    for ( int i=0 ; i < this.MyControl.TabPages.Count ; i++ )

6690421,comment,6689741,6690274,5,0,JacobJans,,,"There are a number of things you can do to stay focused and on task. Some of them you probably already do.<p>The first is to simply have a clearly defined goal. While this is obvious, it is also easy to miss. If we don&#x27;t have a clearly defined task, we don&#x27;t know whether or not we&#x27;ve completed it.<p>But even if you have a clearly defined goal, it can still be easy to get distracted. There are two primary reasons for this. The first: If you don&#x27;t know what the next step is, it can be difficult to stay focused. The next time you get stuck, ask yourself how clearly you know what your next step is. If you&#x27;re not sure what to do, then make sure you spend the time figuring that out.<p>But what if you have a clear goal, and you know exactly what you need to do, but you&#x27;re still not staying focused?<p>Then you&#x27;ve probably got a motivation problem. The way to deal with this is pretty straight forward. Simply spend time thinking about the reasons it is important to complete the task, or achieve the goal. Don&#x27;t try to trick yourself here. Be honest. If you can&#x27;t find any good enough reasons to stay focused, then maybe you should be doing something else.<p>In summary: Have a clearly defined goal. Make sure you know exactly what you&#x27;re next step is. And make sure you have the proper motivation.<p>If you&#x27;re interested in this stuff, I recommend reading about the &quot;mental contrasting&quot; technique, as well as the book &quot;Succeed&quot; by Heidi Grant Halvorson.",1383842801

I also love colour planar imagery (flat sections of colour) like vector illustrations and iconography.<p>The problem with how many people are implementing this flat style in UI is that we&#x27;re letting go of valuable information that makes software and websites <i>usable</i> in the first place. This style works great for static pieces (like print, or screen graphics that don&#x27;t change) and of course looks clean and gorgeous in non-functioning Photoshop mockups - but when you get this style onto websites and into apps it&#x27;s often done in a way that just falls flat of its full potential.<p>There&#x27;s my 2. I&#x27;ve been lusting after minimalism in design approach and dying for when colour planar aesthetic style became popular, but now it&#x27;s here too many people are doing it all wrong (even the big ones, like Apple with iOS7)",1383842619

For older things, you&#x27;re typically dating the formation of a mineral grain. Common methods are Potassium/Argon and Uranium/Lead dating.<p>The ages are based on the stratigraphy that the fossils are in.  We can &quot;easily&quot; correlate stratigraphy across wide areas, but most sedimentary rocks are hard to date.  For these particular fossils, the stratigraphy happens to contain a lot of volcanic ash units that can be directly dated.  In most cases, we use the fossils present (biostratigraphy) to correlate with other units that can be directly dated.<p>The exact numerical age is based on dating things like feldspar grains in volcanic units that can be dated with K/Ar dating or zircons in volcanics that can be dated with U/Pb, etc, etc.",1383842603

The insignificant time it takes for code review is the first thing that gets nixed by non-technical management even when the time required for bug fixes, last-minute changes due to their own indecisiveness, and slow development due to giving employees second-rate hardware far eclipse the marginal time it takes to make sure we&#x27;re deploying halfway decent code to production. And then they bitch at the engineers that they&#x27;re underpaying/overworking when shit stops working. But let&#x27;s not hire more developers and improve salaries for the people we have. No, that&#x27;s not what we need. What we need is more charismatic biz-dev bros with poly-sci degrees. Surely that will fix things! (/rant)",1383842496

If I told you I was keeping my savings in bitcoin, and I&#x27;ve saved hundreds of bitcoins for the last two years, and never converted any of them to cash, and never spent any of them in the last two years, you would probably say &quot;Wow.  You&#x27;ve missed at least two great opportunities to cash in on terrible market crashes.  You could have had thousands without investing any more real money, you&#x27;d be filthy rich and have placed nothing at risk.&quot;<p>Certainly I could have done better if I had made _some_ trades.  History tells me I personally will pick the wrong times to trade, and the above strategy is probably best for me, given my strong propensity to buy high and sell low (otherwise I would have those hundreds of bitcoins still.)<p>But if you&#x27;ve never made a transaction, you have never realized any of the value, and an argument can be made that your entire portfolio is at risk.<p>Just like buying 50-year bonds, there is a risk you won&#x27;t live that long.  Nobody&#x27;s going to contact your next-of-kin to alert them to your bitcoin holdings if you die having kept them a secret.  That&#x27;s a real danger to the network, and with a cap on the total number of bitcoins, it causes real harm to everyone when those coins are lost, unaccounted.<p>At least with someone moving them around from time to time, you will be able to know that the keys have not been erased and &quot;those coins are still alive,&quot; you won&#x27;t spuriously inflate the value of your own and your neighbors&#x27; coins on public exchanges, opening yourself to the real dangerous Satoshi attack of &quot;rising from the dead and seizing all of the at-risk cash on everyone&#x27;s trading accounts.&quot;  If Satoshi ever comes back, we will likely have made him fabulously rich and all because we didn&#x27;t think of it first, and people like to jump on bandwagons.<p>No contract!

But then the article could have been written to maximize accuracy or to maximize virality.<p>I write a lot, and there&#x27;s a big difference between the styles. For some topics, that can translate into a big difference in the content of an article.<p>Productivity is definitely prone to that. There&#x27;s a whole genre known as &quot;productivity porn&quot;, so called because some people feel compelled to look at it far beyond actual utility.<p>Right from the title of the article, I was put on guard. The word &quot;unlock&quot; indicates minor action will bring great improvement, freeing me from possibly-unsuspected constraints. Who wouldn&#x27;t want that? Then we get three awesome, hard-to-reach states in a row. Next a mysterious sciencey-sounding effect named after somebody I&#x27;ve never heard of but who has an intriguing name. It&#x27;s a perfect productivity porn title.<p>When I clicked through, my skepticism was increased. On my phone, the first thing I saw was a bunch of share buttons with some needy, manipulative copy to get me to click them. There&#x27;s a big stock photo of a pretty woman that conveys zero actual information. There were a modest number of short, upbeat paragraphs broken up with large titles. There are what I&#x27;m sure were links to other productivity articles in the body. There&#x27;s relatively little subtlety, and a concluding paragraph that dubiously hates on the 8-hour work day. Then we get a paragraph trolling for comments, which increase stickiness. And then more share buttons with the same manipulative copy.<p>I understand that this is a popular way to build a profitable content business these days. But I also understand that &quot;profitable content business&quot; and &quot;reliable source of high-integrity, low-drama journalism&quot; are poorly correlated. No matter how solid your writing and how true your heart, the context and the constraints of written-for-virality prose make me skeptical.

ES6 generators are (shallow) coroutines (or &quot;extended generators&quot; in Python-land[0]). From the outside, they provide a `send()` method as the converse to `next()`, and that method is used to inject a value back in the generator, via `yield` as an expression. And yes you can use the same yield to send a value out and retrieve one in the same &quot;yield step&quot;.<p>That is how e.g. taskjs[1] works:<p><pre><code>    spawn(function*() {
        var data = yield $.ajax(url);
        $(&#x27;#result&#x27;).html(data);
        var status = $(&#x27;#status&#x27;).html(&#x27;Download complete.&#x27;);
        yield status.fadeIn().promise();
        yield sleep(2000);
        status.fadeOut();
    });
</code></pre>
the first line sends a promise to the scheduler and suspends the generator, the scheduler then resumes the generator with send() to inject the resolution of the promise back in.<p>> The meaning of a symbol can often be inferred from its context - it doesn&#x27;t need to be a reserved word.<p>Not without function * . the purpose of function * is precisely to provide the context for `yield` being not-a-name.<p>> Yes, it would not be allowable to have an open paren after yield.<p>You do realize how utterly insane that reads right? You propose crippling `yield` and making it significantly less convenient and sensible to get rid function * (and the colon does not work, it conflicts with labels)<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0342/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0342/</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://taskjs.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://taskjs.org/</a>",1383842114

We have found that the value of cloud workspaces has been around instant access and centralized control (for groups of workspaces).  So, it is possible to offer on-demand, temporary workspaces without login (some vendors provide that including Codenvy).  It tends to be a vendor choice as to whether requiring authentication before gaining project access is important.  Most vendors do require authentication as it allows for saving important properties, user configurations, and some security settings.<p>To see some of the use cases around why cloud IDEs are used over desktop IDEs, we have listed them on our site.  <a href=""https://codenvy.com/why/cloud-ide/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://codenvy.com/why/cloud-ide/</a>.  The early uses have been around scenarios where configuration / setup of desktop are burdensome: pair programming, hackathons, training events, or partner integrations.  We have some demos with Google, Intuit, and WSO2 that show what IDE on demand might be like, but those are special case scenarios.<p>As for the concept of downloading the IDE itself.  Some cloud vendors do offer offline mode, and packaged chrome apps which do give that very behavior.  It&#x27;s first inning sort of stuff, but it will be possible in the future to allow offline sync of the development experience.  Some cloud providers offer both build / debugger runtimes, so downloading offline, means also having a way to synchronize the project&#x27;s files, and the underlying infrastructure necessary to execute the code.   In a pure Web app sense, where it&#x27;s HTML / CSS / JavaScript, this is fairly easy.  But if you need to have synchronized access to dependencies, libraries, or runtimes, then the challenges are more pronounced.<p>Thanks for the cool questions.",1383841015

The view of the quasi-totality here seem to think it&#x27;s the same, but I think the distinction is important.

Maybe I would not have had a cold either so the causal conclusion is flawed.<p>If you transpose that example to the &quot;terrorism&quot; case, you get a similar type of logic flaw. I can believe that 34 plots where thwarted since the 7/7 bombings. But do we seriously believe that 0 plots would have been thwarted without the new security measures? Not really. Maybe 33 would have been thwarted. Maybe 34, which would mean that all the money poured in the system as well as the privacy sacrifices were made in vain. Who knows?

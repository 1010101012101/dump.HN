And yes, this is why RHT wants OpenStack and better diversification.<p>But speaking as someone who literally based their whole business on managing Oracle on *nix, Solaris/AIX/HP-UX are dead platforms.  Over 80% of the Oracle servers our users are managing with our software are Linux.  Of those, probably 80% of them are RHT, and 15% are Oracle Linux.  SLES and CentOS barely register.<p>There is one more massive advantage that RHT offers vs. anyone like CoreOS - platform stability.  Things like driver interfaces, library versioning, kernel versions all make it much easier for ISVs and corporate engineering teams to certify and manage RHEL releases.  They&#x27;re not a fast-moving target.<p>Over time that will become less relevant, I agree, but it&#x27;s been a huge factor in their success.",1392332389

How could he make such a fundamental, incredibly ignorant error?<p>Even if we believe the &quot;bad luck, terrible timing&quot; explanation, Defcon&#x27;s lack of caution and general awareness is simply inexplicable. There is no way he would be so nonchalant about any kind of fault in the Bitcoin protocol with everyone&#x27;s money sitting out in the open, just waiting to be stolen.<p>I think the moral of this story is to not open an account with an anonymous exchange. Instead, open an account with a marketplace backed by some high-profile VC&#x27;s who have some skin in the game.

7235209,comment,7234202,7234567,2,0,dTal,,,"If you start with GPL stuff (and in my experience most of the really good open source software is GPL), it&#x27;s very difficult to sell the resulting proprietary product, as you must provide the source on request and you cannot prevent it from being shared; thus, anyone can build it themselves (some projects I&#x27;ve seen that use this model deliberately make their build process tricky, I suppose to encourage sales-by-laziness - Apple is the king of this with their essentially-unbuildable releases of Darwin).<p>No, I rather think the best model is the one where software is treated like a public resource; the knowledge commons. A lot more companies are interested in using software internally than in selling it, and many will already have in-house software developers to build their business-specific systems. It makes a lot of sense for companies to pool their resources on common software problems that they all need to be solved and aren&#x27;t their core focus.<p>In a sense, your &quot;base of the pyramid&quot; is something of a special case for this model. Basecamp is software-as-a-service, and Ruby on Rails is utility software designed for the express purpose of creating software-as-a-services. It&#x27;s to be expected that, as free software gains momentum, the first companies to benefit will be the ones that build applications that need to run on reliable, non-locked-in stacks, because a reliable, non-locked in stack is the first thing that free software needed to build. In the long term, though, I hope that really substantial &quot;user-facing&quot; software gains enough critical mass to become the de-facto standard - for example, Blender or GIMP. In such a scenario, any business that needed an off-the-shelf 3D editor or image editor but also developed in-house software (for example, Pixar) would find it in their interest to patch bugs and generally improve the software that they use, even though they don&#x27;t sell it.",1392332008

(The car analogy really helps this.)<p>Unlike the other open source efforts Levine lists, Red Hat sells Free Software. Now, hang on just a second and hear this out: it&#x27;s not that Red Hat is _evangelizing_ like the FSF does.<p>Red Hat has simply capitalized on the model that GPL Linux is better than _any_ proprietary server OS. I know I&#x27;ve never seen anything come close to it. Feel free to point out a server OS that competes successfully with Linux – gratis!<p>Red Hat can&#x27;t charge for the razors but they make up for it by charging for blades: stuff your company _shouldn&#x27;t_ be doing in-house. You can outsource it all to Red Hat: installation, maintenance, QA, everything. They&#x27;re basically an early freemium model.<p>Levine is correct that the market potential has not exploded for Red Hat (yet) but he concludes that nobody else should try what they&#x27;re doing. I think he doesn&#x27;t understand exactly what Red Hat is doing.<p>Due to the unique pricing structure caused by Free Software, a &quot;differentiated service on top of the platform&quot; model would fail. For Red Hat, that would be something like selling proprietary system management software on top of Linux, and assuming it was sufficient.<p>If Red Hat were evangelizing Free Software they might be content with a sub-par product &quot;because freedom!&quot; Take laptops, for example: System76, ZaReason, and laclinux.com remain small. Their product does not represent a tier 1 product, even though they make a differentiated laptop on top of the same base of laptop ODMs.<p>Levine correctly concludes that Red Hat will not grow as rapidly as a Google or Amazon. It&#x27;s not an apples-to-apples comparison. Instead, compare Red Hat to Microsoft, CA, or Oracle who compete directly in the &quot;razors & blades&quot; market of enterprise IT support.

He found a crop of marijuana on the farm and turned it into the police. The planters of the crop decided that what happened was that my sisters boyfriend must of stolen it to sell. So they drove to my fathers house at dinner time, four of them, and started demanding payment.<p>My sisters boyfriend confronted them and told them what had happened, which then resulted in a four on one beat down. My dad ran back into the house grabbed a bat, ran back out and hit two of them. First guy dropped unconscious with the first blow, second guy stumbled dazed. The last two took off so fast they left the car behind.<p>My mother had rung the police before the violence had started, and they arrived before my sisters boy friend had managed to get off the ground. They arrested my father and he spent the next 3 days in jail. No other charges where laid.<p>Tens of thousands of dollars later the case was thrown out by a jury and the judge scolded the police for there actions and for wasting the courts time and tax payers money.<p>During the proceedings evidence came forward that the police had received the crop, and instead of filing paper work just disposed of it being lazy (the same cop that arrested my father). Before the court the cop was fingered by other police officers as a liar, breaking laws, my family pointed it out, even the four guys fingered the cop as a liar. Official complaints where laid, the response was no wrong doing could be found.<p>A few months after the incident my cousins mates where doing burn outs around, being little bastards really, but the cop couldn&#x27;t catch them. Angry he went to my cousins house, it was around 3am. Knocked on the door asking where they where.<p>My cousin is also a farmer, gets up around 5am, he opened the door tired and confused. Said he hadn&#x27;t seen them. The cop got in his face yelling at him, so my cousin said &quot;listen I got work in a few hours and I need some more sleep, they aren&#x27;t here, you can see that, how about you just fuck off&quot;. Which resulted in the cop kicking the door out of his hands and beating my cousin so bad he had to be taken to hospital with a broken jaw, and swelling so bad he couldn&#x27;t open his eyes. During the beating the cop threatened my cousin, his mates, and father directly.<p>My father, and my family are pillars of the community. My dad grew up in the town, was the local scout master, organises the christmas parades, helps with local stage performances. So the event did not go down well at all.<p>The next bit of what happened is all heresy but this is what I&#x27;ve been told happened. Photos where taken of my cousin. A group of local farmers went to the police station, handed over the photos and said if the cop steps out of line once more he will be lynched (black mail essentially). I&#x27;ve heard variations where they roughed the cop up to send the message to him.<p>He was told he wasn&#x27;t welcome on any bodies property in the area and to search for a new position immediately. If he failed that then the town was going to turn on his big time, and the photos would be used if an investigation began to make him loose his job. I can remember being in the supermarket on a visit and watching someone eye ball the cop as he was shopping, staring straight down the isle at him, as the cop moved to the next aisle the guy just moved along to the end of that aisle and eye balled him till he left the store.<p>The cop was gone in 6 months, but it took an entire rural community to stand up to him when the police and the complaints organisation wouldn&#x27;t. You could say there are procedures to deal with these situations, but there aren&#x27;t when they are design to protect the police.<p>The real sad bit is that prick just moved to another station. He&#x27;s probably still trying to beat confessions out of kids right now.<p>So I have become a &quot;don&#x27;t talk to the police&quot; person as well. I don&#x27;t treat them badly, I smile at them on patrol, but the moment anything starts to get tense I have less than zero trust.",1392331519

That is not unreasonable in some situations, particularly one where lives are at stake or where there is clear and present danger.<p>My point is that while the arrest may have been bad, what happened after is egregious and clearly definable as awful.

While it&#x27;s possible to have a debate about the initial arrest, it&#x27;s impossible to justify what happened after.

It is a rational response to the fact that the police consistently act like thugs, and the problem is only getting worse. One of the most important problems is that the mechanisms for righting these wrongs are almost wholly ineffective or out-of-reach. Peretz talks a little about that in his piece.<p>The most practical thing you can take away from this is to <i>not trust the police</i>. Reform will take years, and in that time you are at risk. Reform is a great sentiment - but what specifically can we do? I would say: you can at least think about the nature of the systematic problem that takes away essentially all accountability from city police departments. Why does it seem like the public is no longer outraged when police abuse occurs? Why does it seem like government officials don&#x27;t admit any wrongdoing or apologize for anything anymore? Why are lawsuits so expensive?<p>What it seems like to me is that, somehow, the public has been convinced of their ineffectiveness. They have been cowed into submissiveness. Besides, there are bigger fish to fry, and <i>I</i> haven&#x27;t been abused by the police. It&#x27;s just not that big of a problem. And the monotonically increasing complexity of government has provided amazing levels of defensive cover for bad actors. It&#x27;s an almost perfect shield of immunity to prosecution and incredibly expensive litigation barrier-to-entry. &quot;Reform&quot; sounds nice - but what do you think we should do?

To get them to justice, as was mentioned in another comment, would cost tons of money and time and there&#x27;s no guarantee of any kind of result.

My explanation of that phenomenon is that those countries are small (both in territory and number of citizens) and are, indeed, operate like small companies. Thus it&#x27;s relatively easy to keep them accountable. Of course, many other small countries have very corrupt police, so this can only account for a part of the explanation.<p>My opinion is that where there is no market mechanism to effectively communicate customer satisfaction, you will see abuse. People see it again and again, yet they keep paying taxes to sponsor this shit, because they are being told there will be anarchy or the poor wouldn&#x27;t have the money to hire a private police protection.

This info came from Greg Maxwell, a bitcoin core developer.  He got his information from the owner of MtGox himself:<p>Gox implemented custom wallet software to deal with massive transaction volume.  The reference client wouldn&#x27;t cut it for their purposes.  For what it&#x27;s worth, Greg agrees with the decision to write custom software for high-volume exchanges.  It seems pretty likely that other exchanges have also implemented custom bitcoin software stacks.<p>In the scenario where Gox detected that a transaction failed, they automatically reissued the transaction.  But that was based on the faulty assumption that the transaction hash couldn&#x27;t ever mutate.  This flaw was exploited to siphon bitcoin out of Gox.<p>This doesn&#x27;t matter very much for Gox because, conservatively, they&#x27;ve made at least 120k BTC in profits from trade fees.  More likely in the range of 400k.  So they&#x27;ll be able to cover the losses.<p>But this means it&#x27;s entirely possible that other exchanges and web services with custom software stacks were hit hard by the malleability event, just like Gox was.

Only I was not courageous enough to step forward and be heard - there is a certain shame in being put in jail, even if you didn&#x27;t do anything wrong. The shame is really on the officers, and the system the enables them to abuse the citizens who might even be operating under the delusion that the police are there to protect and serve, rather than bully, escalate, and abuse.<p>And I hear the defensive tone in her voice. She feels, as I do, that many people in the public won&#x27;t believe, or if they do believe, that they will rationalize the police behavior. Or even if they don&#x27;t rationalize, they will keep quiet, feeling powerless and not strong enough to make a difference. But, what Peretz has shown me personally, is that there is a certain strength in numbers, and sharing your experience so that other people don&#x27;t feel like they&#x27;re the only one who got treated that way, that they are not the only one who got brutalized by American city police - and then were left with absolutely no options to keep them accountable.<p>The system is fucked and it needs to change. Police should be required to record all audio and video of their actions, and provide this footage to anyone they interact with, on request. And if that device doesn&#x27;t work, they should be severely reprimanded. (Officer Sasenbach of the SBPD, the one who threw me in jail without arrest and without reason, had a recording device which &quot;failed&quot; the night of our interaction.)<p>Much of my experience was eerily familiar - the suddenness of the violence on the street, when Sasenbach decided I was trouble. The taunts from the jail keepers. The taking of clothing (jacket and shoes), and kept in a cell too cold to sleep in for 12 hours. Asking for a phone call, and being ignored. Asking if I was arrested, and being ignored. Asking what right they have to keep me, and having them smirk and say, &quot;because I&#x27;m on this side, and you&#x27;re on that side&quot;.<p>When I filed a complaint, the sargeant assigned to the case was sullen, bored. Sasenbach&#x27;s personal recorder was broken; the video feed in the cell i was kept in was broken. I could file another complaint if I wanted.<p>I remember feeling so out-of-body, like the system I&#x27;d grown up to believe in, the system that was supposed to represent &quot;the good guys&quot; was completely upended. These were brutal, horrible people drunk on their power over me, and delighted to cause as much harm as they could get away with, for no other reason that they could. It was an important moment in my life, when my illusion about the state, the police, and the bare issue of who we trust with a monopoly of violence became starkly defined: none of us are safe. The police can invade our lives at will, and do what they want to us, and we are helpless to defend ourselves. The only thing preventing general rebellion is statistical: the number of people who &quot;win&quot; the shit lottery that is interacting with the cops is very low, and it&#x27;s hard to convince others that they are indeed at risk of suffering the same treatment. Who knows, perhaps things will change.",1392329117

Why should I trust some random small company I&#x27;ve never dealt with to not be malicious or incompetent?)<p>What I really want is a good, up to date software that I can pay for, but is still open source.

And they learned something very important about the tool.<p>Maybe just a demo video works, maybe links to other people's creations… We're planning on treating it like adults and doing some A/B testing. :)<p>I agree, that ""e"" logo need to never be hanging out in the middle of the page like that!

Would it make life easier to have the UI be available on the web? If either of these is a ""yes"" then make the case on those grounds; ""everyone is writing..."" is a terrible reason for doing something.<p>In any case I see no point rewriting them in Java FX, that would just be replacing one dying technology with another.",1355936337
4943443,comment,4942943,4943377,3,0,dietrichepp,,,"Someone posted a challenge on Reddit a while back for people to crack his license key generator.  He gave them the source code to a test program which would verify keys and gave people a sample key that worked.  He seemed to think it was uncrackable.<p>1. People quickly figured out that the key generator just verified RSA signatures.<p>2. Since he implemented RSA by hand (I guess calling OpenSSL's RSA_INIT() would be too ""obvious"") it had bugs.  Specifically, it didn't check that the signature in the key was strictly below the key modulus, meaning that given signature X, you could add the modulus to get a new valid signature.<p>3. Since the license keys can't be ridiculous long pieces of text, the key was not long enough.  Someone went to a website online and pasted the key into a Java prime factorization applet and cracked it, posting a key generator.<p>There is always a tradeoff between security and usability.  Unfortunately, the tradeoff here is prohibitive: if you use a 1024 bit key and base 32 encoding, your users will have to type in a minimum of 205 characters to enter the product key.  Base 32 is the densest reasonable encoding for human input, or close to it.<p>So the lesson is that even the simple requirement ""can't create a keygenerator"" is an open problem.",1355936336

For example, God didn't make ""the devil"", he made an angel who chose to go against God.<p>The ""Eternal life"" thing sounds like coercion when you think of it as ""do this or you'll be tortured in hell"" but the point is God lets you chose to be with him or to not be with him.

I would like to introduce you to my last app by talking about cuisines around the world.\nI always liked discovering and taste different tastes from around the world. And I like to cook, also. \nThere is a big problem while learning a new recipe (maybe from another country). You never know if the recipe is enough accurate, or the ""real one"".  I live in Italy and I can assure that most of the homemade pizza recipes I found on the web are a lot different from the original one.\nI personally think that a good recipe comes from the country the recipe is from. Why? Simply because the recipes are part of the history and culture of that country and they changed and evolved along with people.\nI thought it would be cool having ""something"" that would make easier to find good quality exotic recipes. So, during the summer,  I began creating an app aimed at solving this problem. And that ""something"" became reality. If you feel my app could be useful for you to cook, you can get it for free by following this link: http://bit.ly/MWkfey<p>Bye from Italy and happy cooking!",1355936263

There were some scene that felt more cinematic, but especially scenes without much camera movement felt like watching actors on a set.<p>Like the author, this pretty much ruined the movie for me, but I'm not prepared to totally write off HFR.  I think directors will just need to learn how to properly adjust filming techniques to keep HFR feeling like a movie, similarly to how they had to learn to incorporate green screens without having an obvious separation between the actors and the CGI (which a lot of directors still get wrong).",1355936250

4943392,comment,4942436,4943262,2,0,rayiner,,,"> That is because they want credit for the idea. Give them credit and share it freely, and most people will not complain, even if they never intended for their ideas to be shared by millions of people (many will be happy with the fame, even if they don't see millions of dollars for it -- again, as long as they are getting credit, or at least as long as nobody else gets the credit).<p>It goes far beyond credit. Find a popular restaurant with an original shtick, set up a copy, and see if proper attribution changes the degree to which you've pissed off the owner of the original.<p>Do a thought experiment. Do you remember the episode of ""Big Bang Theory"" where Penny comes up with the idea to sell Penny Blossoms (little hair accessories)? See: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-0qn_-TAo"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF-0qn_-TAo</a><p>Imagine this hypothetical: someone else sees Penny Blossoms, copies the idea and the name, and makes a ton of money selling their copy mass-produced by Chinese labor. What is Penny's reaction in this hypothetical? Is she excited to see her ideas be disseminated, or pissed off that someone else is making money off her idea? Does attribution change that reaction?<p>> Only people who want to exploit ideas for profit use terms like ""intellectual property""<p>""Intellectual property"" exists because people believe, very strongly, in the right to profit from their own ideas to the exclusion of others. People perceive it as ""unfair"" when someone else makes money off their idea. The Apple versus Samsung case is a really great example. The case didn't happen because certain patents existed. The case happened because Samsung released products that looked a lot like iPhones, and Apple (Jobs) felt ripped off. If patents didn't form the basis of the suit, Apple would have found something else--the feeling of being ripped off came first, the law came after.<p>> That is because the rest of us have not been brainwashed to the point of thinking that copying things is a destructive activity.<p>You're wildly confused about whether the chicken or the egg came first. Perceptions about the protection of ideas predate ""all that money donated by Hollywood and the recording industry, all their lobbying, all the revolving door politics..."" Obviously copyright and patent date back to before the Constitution, but even in contexts where neither copyright nor patent apply, there has been a strong theme of people wanting to protect intangible property. Usually these come up in the context of ""misappropriation"" or ""unfair competition."" In many respects, the protection of ideas under the current law is much narrower than what people thought should be the case historically. It was popular (though never the law), for a long time, to appeal to a ""labor theory of copyright"" where people thought facts or news should be protectable if they took effort to collect or gather. There is a strong conceptual appeal to the idea that if one spends effort creating something, whether tangible or intangible, one owns and should be able to control it. It's a manifestation of our monkey selves.<p>Another good example is analyst stock recommendations/price targets. These are clearly facts/opinions and not protected by any intellectual property regime (an attempt to extend protection to them under a misappropriation theory was struck down by the Second Circuit recently). But even though the law doesn't protect these recommendations, people genuinely feel ripped off when aggregator sites repost analyst recommendations.

Obviously, as you can imagine from someone with the title of Director of Operations, no one was asked for input.<p>A few weeks later, we;re all given copies of the handbook and ordered to sign it.  People read the handbook and it was very clear that the new rules were not in line with company culture at all.  No drinking in the office when we had multiple beer fridges, stuff about how you can be fired with less notice, etc.  Of course, no one in their right mind would agree to an amended rulebook while at a company, especially when they could freely move to another startup.<p>The thing that amazed me most though, was in our next company meeting, people kept asking the Director of Operations about the rulebook and he finally snapped to say ""Look, I made some changes, if you dont like them, its just really not a big deal, I don't think the rulebook actually means anything anyway"".<p>Okay so lets recap.

Give them credit and share it freely, and most people will not complain, even if they never intended for their ideas to be shared by millions of people (many will be happy with the fame, even if they don't see millions of dollars for it -- again, as long as they are getting credit, or at least as long as nobody else gets the credit).<p>Only people who want to exploit ideas for profit use terms like ""intellectual property,"" because they are desperate to convince everyone else that ideas are a form of capital.  The rest of us use words like ""idea,"" ""song,"" ""movie,"" ""book,"" ""equation,"" ""name,"" ""DNA sequence,"" etc. to describe things that might be copyrighted, patented, trademarked, or whatever else.  That is because the rest of us have not been brainwashed to the point of thinking that copying things is a destructive activity.<p>""Also, claiming the copyright regime is not the product of democracy is utterly ludicrous""<p>Yes, because as we all know, hundreds of millions of Americans care deeply about Sonny Bono's vision of lifelong copyrights and the end of the public domain; all that money donated by Hollywood and the recording industry, all their lobbying, all the revolving door politics, none of it had anything to do with the Mickey Mouse act, the DMCA, or TPP.  No, this is all highly democratic -- we just heard Obama and Romney talking about the importance of ensuring that websites like Megaupload be removed from the Internet, and that programs like deCSS remain outside of America.<p>""If people cared so much about this""<p>People don't care; people ignore copyrights when they want to share things with each other, which is in no way a new situation.  People were singing Happy Birthday at public events without giving a damn about the copyright status of that song.  Copyrights are a regulation on industry, and it is absurd to try to apply copyrights to the day-to-day lives of ordinary people.  The only reason copyrights became a major issue in the past 30 years is that the industries that depend on copyright to turn a profit discovered that they are no longer necessary, and so they tried to expand copyright to turn back the technological clock.

If there were little link icons that showed up for each attribute on element box (node?) hover that when clicked would show the possible attachment points on the other elements, that would have been more straight-forward.<p>- Don't like having to click an attribute to see and adjust it's value. And I was secretly hoping that there was an invisible slider ala Brett Victor so that I could just drag my cursor and have the value adjusted.<p>- My window only took up half the screen so when it came to applying the text, it inserted the text layer barely visible in the bottom corner. You could still move the element around, but the black modal that popped up with how to use it stayed on top and had no way of being closed, so my lesson ended there. I think a Layers window like digitalengineer suggested would be helpful here, but also possibly making it so that there's a wizard-like step system with an area underneath for specific instruction so people can see how far along they are and know exactly where to look for help.<p>Overall, great work!

Since you are studying Spanish, if you have access to a Spanish language cable network (or a broadcast TV or radio station in some cities) use that.  Start with something that is fairly predictable, like the weather forecast.  Get podcasts and listen to those.  Rent movies in Spanish (and turn off the English subtitles).<p>On the other side, find people to talk to.  Ideally, you want native speakers.  You want to spend extended periods talking in Spanish.

The layers are broadly: lower level sensory systems(vision, speech recognition) and higher level symbolic reasoning systems. Recently, there has a been a lot of success in the lower layers due to Machine Learning and probabilistic systems. The messiness comes in the lower layers. When dealing with the higher layers you face much harder problems. Hard in the sense of Turing uncomputable. The only formal solution proposed for general AI is uncomputable <a href=""http://www.hutter1.net/ai/uaibook.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hutter1.net/ai/uaibook.htm</a>.<p>Also there is nothing which restricts real world problem solvers to a single domain. Most messy problems have a formal solution. The engineering part is what remains (but the engineering part is nevertheless hard!).

741959,comment,741411,741572,0,0,silencio,,,"This is just my personal experience with their Mandarin Chinese software (disclosure: offered free through my college language lab, otherwise I never would have touched it): I hated it. I understand the idea of immersion behind the software, but I found it incredibly hard to grasp any real working knowledge of grammar and cultural aspects/differences, it just feels a lot more like a super expensive flashcard app with a few gimmicks. Plus the whole immersion thing was supposed to avoid you ""translating"" into a language you are comfortable with and then translating that into the new language...I didn't find myself skipping that ""bridge"" with Rosetta Stone. I gave up on the software after being bored out of my mind in a couple weeks before my Chinese class started, and just went back to textbooks and resources like chinesepod.com, where after a couple weeks of that I started to feel more comfortable about doing the very thing Rosetta Stone seeks to skip, a lot in part because Rosetta Stone was incredibly unhelpful with grammar and such. Then the class started, and being able to converse with and get tips from native speakers helped immensely.<p>On the other hand, I found Pimsleur and similar methods of learning languages to be semi-helpful and possibly worth spending money on. No replacement for memorizing things and total immersion via traveling/marrying someone/studying abroad, but when you're stuck in traffic in the car, listening and practicing speaking can do volumes to help.<p>In the end, I just got a flashcard app for my iPhone, stocked up on MP3s and videos to watch and listen to, and I think that was more helpful than Rosetta Stone ever could be. I'm not sure if there's any research or studies behind language acquisition via Rosetta Stone, but when I'm an adult, I don't see the benefit in learning a language as if I was a toddler again. I had learned French in high school and learning Spanish afterwards was ridiculously easier because I had already had ""basics"" like grammar down pretty well, as well as an easier time learning vocabulary as there are many cognates. Not that I remember much of either language anymore, but there are some times when taking advantage of what an adult already knows is faster and more helpful than learning like a baby.",1249415288

I am curious to know if this reasoning is, well, reasonable.<p>- CPUs are inherently not functional.  They are imperative, as they are Turing machines.  They don't speak high-level math.<p>- Therefore, programs written in a functional language must always be translated into imperative code for execution.  Compare this with an imperative language where the compiler need not perform super-fancy translation.<p>- If the problem can be mapped efficiently to machine code by the compiler, the functional program is fast; otherwise, it may be slow.  Either way, it may be very hard to know what is going on behind the scenes.<p>- This is not always a lose; sometimes the compiler can perform extensive optimizations because it speaks math, and the functional language will win handily.<p>- Writing in an imperative language, you always know how your program will behave; however, you lose the opportunity to have the compiler deduce a better way (assuming there is a better way) by writing in a functional language.<p>- But if there is no better way, you have the opportunity to make the execution very fast by modeling the imperative solution around the constraints of the hardware.<p>Of course, there are other dimensions to performance, among them programmer productivity and number of defects.",1343325027

Specific to, say, AdWords, the point I'm making is that people who a) have enough development capability to ship software products and b) also know AdWords well enough to get entrusted with a company's budget are as rare as hen's teeth.

There are a <i>lot</i> of marketing departments which think that developing 900 landing pages would take a team of 20 people the better part of a year.

Quite obviously no useful program can be totally pure (otherwise it'd do nothing but heat the machine). And Simon Peyton Jones is on record saying that he's not sure if he'd carry the laziness torch quite so far if he had to do it all over again. Neither is to say that these aren't powerful or useful techniques, but rather that in Haskell they're chosen as defaults -- impure and/or strict code are the outliers that require justification, not the other way around. So given that, in what way is using ByteStrings (safe or unsafe) subversion? Far from it -- use the tool that makes sense.<p>With most functional languages, the usual technique to writing fast code is to first write it to be correct, and then transform it to be fast. And that's exactly what unsafe ByteStrings are: optimizations. There's nothing wrong with optimized code, and I see no problem with the technique. The only relation it bears to the OP is that it's an explicit unboxing. Perhaps the compiler should automatically do that unboxing, but that's easier said than done.",1343324389

Practically unusable in my case because joint accounts are not yet allowed, but I immediately jumped on the invite I was waiting on for two years. As Cushman noted, the name says it all  Simple.<p>The interface is gorgeous and intuitive and unlike anything you find at any other bank. It won't ever be for everybody, but I believe it will be the very best option for many that need only the simplest and smartest of banking options.<p>I recently needed to write a check for several thousand dollars to an individual for a service provided. This would have been impossible if Simple was my only bank, because they do not issue paper checkbooks. I either could have withdrawn cash each day over a week-long period ($500 daily max) or arranged to set them up to be paid electronically. But I don't think we are to a point yet where paying a local, small-business owner with an electronic transfer for a service is feasible. Can you imagine if someone you were expecting immediate payment from for a service you just provided said ""I can't write you a check, but give me your email address or bank routing number and account number, and I will be sure to have that transferred to you, which may take two to five days."" No way. Maybe someday.<p>I have found one bank that encompasses basically all the features Simple has promised from the beginning. Believe it or not, it is State Farm Bank. The interface is clunky compared to Simple, but they deliver on the product: iPhone app with photo check deposit, bill pay and transfers. Real-time account balance. Balance reflecting future planned deposits and payments. Through the website you can send money to anyone through PayPal or direct to their bank accounts, deposit checks by scanning and transfer in and out of your own external bank accounts. Reimbursement for all ATM fees. You get paper checks. I've never had any fees issued or any reason to contact support for anything.

Many people are bidding for ad words as if the google adword is what brought you the customer.<p>The thing is, at least in my case, this simply isn't true.   Nobody buys a VPS on the first click;  if someone clicks through a google ad for my company, yeah, google should get some credit, but most of the credit should go to the blog the customer saw a month ago.<p>That's the thing;  because the adwords are the first hits and are super convenient for the customer, they pick up a lot of people that would have clicked on the organic result.<p>Now, this is okay if they are taking a very small cut, but the way many people use google adwords?  the price is bid up to a very large cut of the profit you are going to earn from that customer.  I mean, yeah, sure, if google really is bringing me brand new customers that had never heard of me; people I would not otherwise have a chance with, yeah, I can see paying 90% of the profit.   But if google is bringing me customers that were very likely to come to me anyhow?  eh, I'm not going to want to pay google nearly that much.<p>I think this is also why facebook is so highly valued;  people believe that facebook has enough tracking data to see that blog that my customer read last week that actually caused the customer to sign up through the adword this week.   And maybe they do... but it's a dang difficult problem, and I haven't seen facebook make much progress.   Even then, they are going to have a hard time integrating the people that heard of me because of the checkout-line advertisements I bought in Mountain View Safeways.<p>(because of this, my advertising dollars go into cost per impression advertising, rather than cost per click.)",1343323851

Today 95% of the problem is clueless Windows admins, and bad user decisions.<p>As far as my own experience goes, I've ran Windows 3.1, 95, 98, 2000, XP, Vista, and all the rest never having been compromised. So it is possible at least.<p>What you're doing is the same when people complain about IE 6 vs. the latest version of Chrome...<p>IE6 came out in 2001, and at that time was the most standards-compliant and feature full of all the browsers on the market (well, except for IE 5.5 for MacOS).<p>> They didn't have to have everyone running as root by default in all versions of Windows before Vista (AFAIK in XP Home you can't actually set up restricted users). They didn't have to have lots of open ports offering things like RPC to the world. They didn't have to have all files executable by default, based solely off the hidden part of the filename in AnnaKournikova.jpg.exe.<p>Of course they had to do all that. The Windows users back then were generally not very savvy and anything that got in their way was a disaster waiting to happen. Also it was a different time. Even today most Windows home users don't even understand the file-system with it's drives, devices, directories, subs, and files. And you wanted them to understand user security and how it plays with applications that they ran? No.<p>> but those opportunities wouldn't have been there if they hadn't ignored security for so long.<p>I guess they should have gotten a time machine to the future to pull all that work and knowledge back to the past. Windows XP should have been based off Windows 7.<p>My point is that what is possible today, was not possible 10, 15, or 20 years ago both from a tech and user point of view...

4297258,comment,4296176,4296176,14,0,cletus,,,"There are two issues that are coming up here: sandboxing and paid upgrades. They are quite different.<p>As a consumer I am completely for sandboxing for myself and for other consumers. In a world where malware is increasingly a problem sandboxed apps will become the norm. That's the reality we live in. Sandboxing being a <i>requirement</i> means that I can fairly safely install anything from the (future) Mac App Store.<p>The OP correctly points out that certain system utilities cannot be sold this way. He is correct but consider the alternative: to not require sandboxing means no one will bother implementing it. Of course Apple could make effort to promote apps that do (or hide apps that don't) but this puts a considerable education burden on the consumer. I'm with Apple on this one: it's simpler and better this way.<p>Now paid upgrades I have mixed feelings about.<p>On the one hand paid upgrades can produce the wrong incentive on the developer: I've seen good apps go from 18 month major version upgrades, to 12 months to 6 months with no reduction in upgrade price. I've also seen old versions abandoned for pretty lame reasons.<p>IMHO having all users on the same version is better for the developer and the consumer. It makes support easier. It creates a consistent experience.<p>But on the other hand I do feel like there is a place for paid upgrades.<p>Are in-app purchases a possibility here? I honestly don't know what's possible with the Mac App Store here.<p>I think developers do get too concerned with turning a user into a perpetual revenue stream however. This is really an old business model that is somewhat outdated.<p>Steam provided the first evidence of this that I can recall. Some years ago they started selling older games for $5 and under. In some cases IIRC the revenue for discounted sales exceeded release date sales at the premium price. More: [1]<p>The iOS App Store produced and continues to produce further evidence that lower prices and a higher volume can often be a better result than selling the ""old"" way (higher price, fewer units, which typically also involves paid upgrades).<p>Often content producers (and I include developers who sell software in this) don't always know what's best for them. This all sounds remarkably like Netflix in many ways. Netflix has provided a means of monetizing old and less popular content yet Hollywood seems to view them as the enemy.<p>Perhaps another model worth considering is to start the price of your app low and as it improves and gains popularity, steadily (and predictably) raise the price.<p>Has anyone tried this? Did it work?<p>EDIT: sandboxing goes beyond ""malware"". I increasingly don't want apps making arbitrary changes to my system. Some may be what I want but most won't. This includes things like forgetting to untick the checkbox that installs some browser toolbar to (on Windows anyway) apps making arbitrary (and sometimes wrong) changes to local policies, registry entries, etc (so the Mac equivalent of that).<p>EDIT2: as a consumer, I want to buy through the App Store. Apple has my payment details. I have a common place to get updates. When I buy from a third-party site I have to deal with:<p>1. Registration;<p>2. A payment gateway that may or may not work;<p>3. Despite an automatic payment a human may need to email me a license file and/or download link that in some cases has taken days;<p>4. Whether or not to trust your site with my information; and<p>5. A completely separate process for updating.<p>So anecdotally as one consumer, if your app can be on the Mac App Store and isn't I'm simply not buying it with very few exceptions (eg I'd still buy Photoshop even if I don't want to).<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/174587/Steam_sales_How_deep_discounts_really_affect_your_games.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/174587/Steam_sales_How_de...</a>",1343323113

Econ 101 assumes zero differentiation between products, zero brand value, etc., in these cases of perfect competition.<p>If you are a developer who's making something innovative and useful, whether on iOS or no, it is differentiated from the rest of the market. You are free to compete on price by selling for $1, but you may also compete on quality, solve a unique problem for your market, and sell for $5 or $10. I believe that many developers are doing exactly the latter, but still selling for $1 simply because they think it's ""what is done."" If they instead sold for $5 or $10, people would still buy and the developer would make more money.

This is easier (not simpler) because it's familiar.  The benefits of immutability are not obvious/familiar.<p>Persistent data structures enable immutable data with cheap(ish) operations that can produce updated versions of that data.  This means I can expose data to multiple threads, calling functions, etc... without worrying about that data being placed into an inconsistent state or viewed in an inconsistent state by callers.<p>Back when much of our profession malloc'ed their memory, we always had to answer the question ""who is going to free() this chunk of the heap?""  And when we answered wrong, or forgot to answer, we leaked memory.  Garbage collectors, while imperfect from a controlability and performance standpoint, are much better at this than humans.<p>An excellent analogy exists with mutable data.  When I expose a piece of mutable data via any public interface, I have to ask the question ""who can change this data and how will consistency be enforced?""  I'm left with the answer ""I don't know, I hope no one gets it wrong"" or even worse: ""they better lock the right semaphore(s) in the correct order"".  Immutable data (implemented via persistent data structures) enables me to instead say ""here's the data, if any caller would like to update, they can a) pass me an updated version which I can validate, or b) call into some part of my public interface and instruct me what update to make""<p>Or, in the case of Clojure (my blub at the moment), put the runtime in charge of maintaining consistency during mutation using refs and the STM.",1343322863

When I learnt music theory (as an adult) the way I was taught is that there is a correct way to go about writing a tune to pass the exam, and that if you evaluate the tune through these criteria it will also sound good. And that you can then reuse these techniques to write more sophisticated and interesting music for other purposes.<p>I have liked the idea that you can do this creative thing, but come up with something which is validly good to an objective criteria. Somewhat like the market - something that makes money within the law has a certain fitness to it. Or code. There's different ways to go about it, but things that don't compile are broken.<p>It separates valid creativity from the mind poison of ""all opinions are equally valid"".<p>Stories are one of the most important things about being human. When we encounter a situation we have to think about, particularly if we don't have rational mechanisms for evaluate it, we fall back to stories. Fiction can be a great way to distil ideas, and create context for thinking about interactions between humans, and give us a foundation for interacting in real-world situations based on good examples.<p>But some are better suited than others. Fifteen years on I'm still trying to work out what the essence was of _The Great Gatsby_ and what his point was. You struggle to find a point that you'd make to an examiner, and there's never quite enough evidence to support it. I've decided that Fitzgerald books are a cloud of atmosphere. The author is just trying to communicate a picture of a setting, and in parts his feelings. I could now write a great essay about his brilliant mechanisms, and place that in the context of his times. But - as much as you might enjoy or hate the book, or identify with characters inside - there's nothing else there to share with an examiner.<p>Whereas Shakespeare is full of clear, valuable, timeless messages. He racks up evidence for the points he wants to make, the situations are timeless, and the soliloquays will keep you brave through the darkness. For a great article about Mandela and Shakespeare in The Australian recently, google for 'The Bard's role at Robben Island' and click through.<p>If you get a basic Kindle you can get a fair bit stuff cheaply. And there's lots of old books on amazon that cost 0.01 unit of your currency, plus postage. Better would be if you could find someone who you like and who likes books in a non-wanky way, and then they can lend books to you they recommend. Then you can have lunch with them and talk about it every now and then.

(which used to be just fiber cuts but has evolved into 'major webapp down' notices, too.)  - the idea behind outages@outages.org is to notify network operators when services that may impact them are down.  The idea is that if my customer is complaining about things being slow to boston, well, if I read outages that morning, I might remember a fiber cut that would explain it.  I guess the same could be true if my customers were complaining about not being able to get to twitter.<p>(personally, I'm in the camp that gets irritated when ""random webapp is down"" messages are posted to outages@outages.org.   <i>I</i> don't care that twitter is down.  I've chosen my customers well enough that they don't complain to me when something that is obviously not my fault like that happens.  But, I am only one person, and the majority have spoken;  I won't fight it.  I will whine a little, though.)<p>News.ycombinator is not about outages, and really not about network and systems operators.  Most of you use IAAS or PAAS.   Though so far, I've seen a lot of tolerance for interesting network and systems operator stories.<p>But yeah, ""x is down"" is... not an interesting story.  ""X went down earlier today;  here is what happened""  sometimes is.<p>>Besides, HN comments are a lot of times more insightful and interesting than the link. We might have gotten a Twitter engineer commenting on what was going on or something else interesting.<p>I think uninteresting articles ought to be voted down or flagged or otherwise gotten rid of.  If the comments are more interesting than the article, then it's an uninteresting article, unworthy of the front page link.<p>>Why is Google Talk down, which affects a fraction of the users, on the front page but Twitter is being actively censored?<p>You keep using that word.

People don't really think of collections of directories (like phonebooks for example), they think of a single directory in which you look up things. When you use ""folder"", this seems to go away and people get the metaphor. When a tech savvy person is explaining it, they frequently interchange the two terms and confuse the listener. A ""directory"" is list that you look up things in, like a dictionary, and a ""folder"" is a object that contains related items.<p>A list of Artists, Rap, Prince, or Slow songs in some mp3 management software resembles people's ideas of a ""directory"" better.<p>One thing I've noticed about these silo/tagging systems and non-savvy users is that, though the users are generally comfortable in them, they also tend to lose data completely <i>a lot</i> and have no idea how to find it again. They also find it very hard to understand the concept of backups because they have no sense of location for any of their data.<p>""File,"" ""Folder,"" ""Copy,"" ""Move,"" ""Mail,"" and ""Trash"" are a really excellent set of terms to explain this stuff easily.

I think the metaphor becomes broken when you go to clipboards and pasting. Maybe the right metaphor is to make the desktop the clipboard.

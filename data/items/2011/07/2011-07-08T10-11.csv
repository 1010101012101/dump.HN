2741936,story,,,1,0,antihero,"Idea for Google+...Calendar Integration",,"Though people are divided on this, I think one great feature of Facebook is the event organisation. While no substitute to ringing people up and asking them to come to your party/meetup/whatever, Facebook events serve as a great centralised location to store information about an event, such as location, date/time, and a general description of what exactly is happening.<p>Currently I've found that socially, people don't really use Google Calendar for events such as this, which is unfortunate because events are sync'd to mobile devices and there are many widgets showing agenda and the like. With Facebook, integration is fairly hackish and not particularly great.<p>However, with GCal, invitation is fairly unwieldy - relying on manually adding people one by one, and by e-mail address (which is annoying because many people have several addresses, and often you don't know people by their e-mail anyway).<p>So why not open up Google Calendar to Google+ so that you can do things such as:<p>- Invite a circle of people to an event.<p>- Comment on events.<p>- Share them on your G+ profile.<p>- RSVP with your G+ account.<p>- Have a centralised calendar entry shared by multiple people so that it can stay current, be moved, updated with new location and descriptions, that would show up on one's GCal in a nice, non-hackish way.<p>Am I alone in thinking this would be a great way to expand G+'s integration with existing Google applications in order to provide a useful feature that would extend G+ and further diminish the reason to use Facebook?<p>I'm not sure where to suggest this to Google - I'd be happy to code something like this, however, not being a Google employee I'm rather powerless to implement it.<p>Does anyone else think this could be a useful feature?",1310122279

I had a vague\n    idea about what a program was and I had read thick books\n    before. I didn&#x27;t even had a computer at my house but I \n    was so curious. I opened it tried to make sense out of \n    the text but I couldn&#x27;t, it seemed like Chinese. The next\n    day I returned the book and I never again got interested \n    in programming until high school.\n</code></pre>\nI did a similar thing, but being so desperate for a computer around the late 90s, I eventually found an old Intel 286 computer that was abandoned in the closet. It had monochrome monitor and I found something called QBASIC. I went to the library and took out very heavy book on it and ended up just copying the source code from the book. I didn&#x27;t understand the code a great deal but the game ran after running through several pages. I thought it was interesting but realized trying to make a game is going to be very tough.<p>What sparked my interest soon after that was creating my own website after my dad helped me host it on a free server. I still have a copy of it backed up on a cd somewhere. It was created with Netscape Navigator. I showed my teacher and classmates. It was magic. It was so awesome.<p>I took a course that taught Visual Basic and also QBasic in junior high. It bored me because we were making very simple apps that I already knew. Wasn&#x27;t learning anything new. Also whenever I sped ahead or began working on other things instructor would emphasize that I was to follow her step by step in an excruciatingly slow pace that the rest of the students had to follow. If she saw someone speeding ahead she would get angry and say STOP. Killed my interest in programming.<p>Then came along counter-strike and and things pretty much went downhill from there. It ruined my academic career playing it so much. I found out that the guy who created counter strike also graduated from the university I would attend some years after.<p>It wasn&#x27;t until I saw my high school friend (nerdy guy who I used to tease in high school but was secretly jealous of his programming knowledge) in University that he inspired me to do what I thought was unthinkable, learn how to code again. &quot;You just stick with it&quot; is what he told me when I asked how he did it. He would show me the windows apps he made and I would be amazed how one could create something from nothing. Even now, that is the magic that drives me. Something out of nothing, and I stuck with it.",1388800668

I have a new iPhone 5S as well.<p>I originally wrote game code with OpenGL ES, and then tried very hard to make the same code work on a Mac with regular OpenGL.  It took more time than it should have to see results and it wasn’t that fun.  About all I can say is that I learned a lot and OpenGL clearly runs efficiently.<p>After seeing Sprite Kit (Mac OS X Mavericks and iOS 7 only) and working with it, I am now <i>completely</i> devoted to these latest OSes.  That framework has solved virtually all of my Mac/iOS parity issues, while allowing code to be almost identical in ways that really impressed me.  Sprite Kit requires far less effort and it produces far greater results.  About the only downside I see is that there would be no hope of porting my code to something like an Android phone (and I don’t happen to care about that).<p>It doesn’t hurt that Mavericks is free so about the <i>only</i> device left out in the cold is my old iPad.

Some folks have been asking for the ability to use Docker as a dev environment container for awhile. I have that in the pipeline, but this unlocks the ability to communicate with Docker on a remote host with only the Docker API. This is exciting because suddenly Vagrant can manage dev environments in Docker hosts.<p>The approach I&#x27;ve been taking so far is SSH-ing into some machine (local or remote), and executing `docker` (client) on that machine. But this requires SSH access. There have been a lot of container-only hosts popping up and Vagrant couldn&#x27;t access those. Now it can.<p>Why would you want Vagrant to access those? Because if Vagrant can access the Docker containers, you get a lot of nice things that Vagrant gives you for free. Besides the workflow, the main benefit is synced folders.<p>With the synced folder abstraction in 1.4, and an upcoming ability for Vagrant to sync folders using rsync or scp with or without inotify, Vagrant will be able to sync your container files locally down onto your machine.<p>Again, why does this matter?<p>Because, say you compile your web app into a Docker container for deployments (and now dev). You can edit files on your own machine just like Vagrant has always let you, these files get automatically synced over to the Docker host, and Docker runs the web app like normal. BAM!<p>Anyways, the next version of Vagrant will be able to do this with or without the Docker client installed. But if the Docker client is not installed, then it will use SSH, which requires SSH access on the Docker host. But with the Docker client, you just get it for free, which is super cool.",1388799515

The YC question about &quot;the time you most successfully hacked some (non-computer) system to your advantage&quot; is, to me, most resonant of the &#x27;hacker&#x27; ethos. Although many answers I&#x27;ve seen to this question involve using a computer system to solve a non-computer problem, the sheer variety of non-tech &quot;hacks&quot; out there speaks volumes about what a &#x27;hacker&#x27; is and does.<p>To me, the label &#x27;hacker&#x27; isn&#x27;t claimed, it&#x27;s earned. I call myself a hacker, though I didn&#x27;t until someone else did. I&#x27;ve never broken into secure systems armed only with a 28.8 bps modem and active matrix screen, though -- I use it entirely in the &#x27;problem-solver&#x27; sense of the word, and proudly.<p>Having programmed since childhood doesn&#x27;t make me a hacker. I owe far more to years of Latin study, an unhealthy interest in logic problems and strategy games, and being trained via school that there is always a solution to every problem if you apply yourself hard enough.<p>But on the other hand, if I were just learning to program now, how much of the &#x27;hacker&#x27; mindset would come along with it? Very little, in and of itself; I tutor beginning students and I&#x27;m always trying to teach them how to solve problems and look for answers, how to be creative and elegant, and how to reuse other people&#x27;s work -- it wasn&#x27;t until I started mentoring that I realised how little of this some people do naturally, and I still don&#x27;t know the reasons why that is.<p>On a side note, and having just re-read <i>Little Women</i>, I have a thought about hacking and poverty. When you are poor, you have to be creative. How much of that mindset overlaps with what makes a good hacker?

In summer I used to go very often to the library. I would walk from my house to my local public library and go straight to he bathroom so that I could wipe the sweat from my face and arms. I&#x27;ve had some of my happiest memories in that library. I will share my most significant experiences.<p>The computers at the local public library had Windows (XP maybe?), we could use them for an hour or more depending on how many people wanted to use the computers. They also had computers in a kid section which had some games and limited internet access (the library&#x27;s portal) and some more computers in another section which only had access to the library&#x27;s portal. Once I was using a computer which was only supposed to be used to check books, somehow I discovered that a lot of times the library&#x27;s portal also had a link to the item in Amazon, and from Amazon I could get into Google and then to any website. I got caught and scolded by a librarian, she told me &quot;If you ever used this computers to get into the internet again, we are going to cancel your library card&quot; or something like, well I never used those computers for the internet again. I used the ones in the kids section and it felt awesome.<p>Another significant thing that at that time didn&#x27;t seem that significant was when I checked out a thick programming book on C or C++ I am not sure. I had a vague idea about what a program was and I had read thick books before. I didn&#x27;t even had a computer at my house but I was so curious. I opened it tried to make sense out of the text but I couldn&#x27;t, it seemed like Chinese.

And I, too, don&#x27;t feel like a real hacker. But of course, the word means wildly different things to different people. Even though I love programming very much and I&#x27;m doing it all the time, and especially doing it for fun, it was only after joining HN that it dawned on me I could be considered a hacker in some circles.<p>Still, my primary definition of being a hacker is someone who is insanely active in hacker and cracker culture, someone very interested in systems security, someone who knows to debug a defunct DSL modem given only an oscilloscope and a bit of tinfoil. That&#x27;s not me.<p>If I were to apply for a VC program that looks for hackers, I&#x27;d probably feel like a bad fit or a complete fraud. Nevertheless, I probably <i>am</i> a hacker. Labels are always an imperfect solution.<p>One other thing about getting people to program: Male or female, I wouldn&#x27;t know where to start either. In school I was literally the only kid into actual programming, out of about 500 students. It was only much later in life that I made my first actual programmer friend, and I also recruited an unhappy English major into programming, but most people just aren&#x27;t interested. And of those who can, and by necessity must, program most would never do it in their spare time for fun.",1388797867

I know brilliant engineers how have done massive non-trivial projects that have generated millions of dollars in revenue who could not pass such an interview.<p>The other aspect is the constant exposure to the language-of-the-day and framework-of-the-day club.  I can see a young aspiring developer becoming utterly disappointed when realizing it is nearly impossible to keep up with it all.  Where do you start?  How do you learn this stuff?  Someone could very easily think they are not up to par if they can&#x27;t walk in these mythical shoes.<p>The truth is very different from that.  There&#x27;s a huge world out there for software engineers.  There are real problems to be solved.  And, no, not everything in software engineering lives and dies on a web browser or a smart phone.<p>Is the OP saying that she needed to feel like a hacker to feel legitimate?  That would be sad.<p>What the hell is a hacker anyway?  Definitions abound.  In many ways it is more about how someone might approach hardware and software problems than anything else.  You don&#x27;t have to be YC material to be a legitimate software engineer.  One could very easily argue there are tons of software engineers out there doing far more important work than almost any YC developer has done to date.  Most of them are invisible.  Think about the people writing code for MRI machines, aircraft avionics or even your car&#x27;s ABS system.<p>If you are young and love software engineering please don&#x27;t think that building websites is the only way you are going to become somebody in this business.

The only issues I can think of are:<p>1) They're heavy, so they cause cranial irritation.<p>2) The padding at the top has come loose, though that's easily fixable with some glue or tape.<p>3) <i>They're not wireless</i>. This is the biggest thing for me. After getting some LG Bluetooth headphones to use with my Android phone for listening to music on the go, wired headphones are really starting to bug me. However, wireless isn't practical for the hours-on-end of music listening that goes on while working, since the battery would probably run out (not sure about that though - the LG's are supposed to last 10 hours).",1330106386

This article is a decent start, but there are many better options in these respective price ranges. Head-fi is there to help - <a href=""http://www.head-fi.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.head-fi.org/</a><p>I've moved considerably upmarket over the years and won't talk about the rest of my setup, but my main cans now are Ultrasone Editions 8s.  They're very pricey (retail $1500 for the basic model, but you can get them used under $1k if you spend enough time on the Head-fi classifieds).  They're considered by many to be the best sounding _closed_ cans out there, and they actually isolate almost as well as good iems.  Plus they're very light and comfortable at 260 grams.<p>So yeah, that's quite a bit of money and I am certainly an audiophile.  OTOH, I use them an average of 4 hours a day and bought them used, so when the time comes I can sell them at little to no loss.  I get a great deal of enjoyment out of my rig and it helps me to do my work, so I consider it a good investment. Same with my Knoll Life Chair.  YMMV.  I actually made a profit on limited edition headphones in the past, purchased a used pair of Audio-Technica L3000s for $1500 in 2005, sold them for $2000 in 2007.

Nowhere in the release do they say that the battery can not be bricked by leaving it for a long period without a recharge.  All they say is that it would take a period of weeks for a Tesla roadster to reach 0% charge, and that the Model S has battery disconnect technology that can extend this to several months.  They also point out that the car will provide increasingly strenuous warnings to plug it in (which, no matter how loud they are, would be hard to hear from across the country, if you've left it in an airport parking lot).<p>If it were true that a Tesla battery pack couldn't be destroyed by letting it fully discharge, or that it had never happened, then they would have mentioned it in the release.  In fact, they take the opposite tack, re-emphasizing near the top of the document that users should always plug the car in when parked.<p>Don't get me wrong, I'm still very enamored by Teslas, and I don't think that this is any different than the owner of a gas-powered car letting it run out of oil and seizing the engine -- it's neglect.

I've seen fashion determine huge amounts of technology choices, and wheels get reinvented constantly in this industry as a result.<p>In 2006ish I did a talk about MVC JavaScript at a tiny FooCamp in Albuquerque. At the time people were all excited about Rails MVC, and I was like, ""hey, initially MVC was for GUIs, and Ajax is headed towards GUIs."" Because of that, it was easy to see that this particular wheel was headed for imminent reinvention.<p>It's easy to sneer at individuals for making technology choices based on fashion, but that's petty. Take a minute to look at <i>communities</i> making technology choices based on fashion. The periodic re-invention of wheels in programming mirrors the cyclical nature of fashion in terms of what people wear.<p>Embarrassing fashion confession: I used to be a raver in the 90s. I wore big baggy jeans. In the disco era, people wore pants like that. They called them flares in the UK and bell-bottoms in the US. Clothing fashions cycle, and programmer fashions cycle too.<p>If fashion is dictating an entire community's technology choices, you can learn something about the fundamental problem they're solving by asking yourself what wheel they're re-inventing, and looking into the history of computer science a little to see how programmers solved it last time.",1330105948

They have SmartDJ (I think Apple has the Genius Match or something? Similar idea) where you can pick a song and it will play similar songs to it. With the Zune Pass, it will pick songs from the Zune library as well, possibly songs you've never heard. It's great for finding new artists with a similar feel to the bands you love. Years back, this is how I found the Black Keys.

That indeed does lead to callback mess. But when you are coding in js you rarely should use anonymous functions. I mostly just use them when I might want to perform recursion.  Going back to my example, I would write the operation as an object like so:<p><pre><code>  var SomeObject = {

Try to improve that number each week.<p>Do 1 exercise for each cycle: Pushups, Squats, Crunches, Burpee's (Squat thrust), Jump Rope<p>For example: Pushups, 1 cycle = 8 sets of 20 seconds or hard work followed by 10 seconds of rest.<p>Do as many pushups as you can in 20 seconds. Stop completely for 10 seconds, do not hold yourself up during this time. Lay down if you can. Start immediately after the 10 seconds is up and do it again.<p>I substitute my exercises every now and then.  For instance, I may change Jump Rope out with rowing on a row machine or doing 20 second sprints.  I will substitute Burpee's for Pullups.<p>Tabata can be as intense or easy as you allow it to be.  It is not only outstanding anaerobic conditioning, but great muscular fitness and endurance as well.  The best part is it will only take you 22 minutes (2 minutes of a light warm up is good before starting).  I'm willing to bet that anyone can find 22 minutes twice week to help better their health.  For the days in between your Tabata days, just do some moderate stuff like a nice 20 minute walk, go kayaking, hiking, biking, whatever...<p>If you're in a crunch for time, take 8 exercises and do 1 cycle. That's a 4 minute intense workout.  Much better than no workout at all.<p>I do this myself and have seen the benefits. I don't run for exercise but was challenged to see how my mile run time would be.  I finished the mile in 5 minutes.  Not too shabby for somebody that doesn't run at all and only does anaerobic conditioning such as this, Muay Thai, Mountain biking and kayaking.",1330105693

Page 39 or 40 of the original thesis, if you get the PDF version, says that the goal of the thesis is to provide a mechanism to build hypermedia systems. This usage is key. The system that you make using REST needs to provide all of the ""linking"" ability within the response. It also assumes (Roy never defined what hypermedia is) that the content type is described somewhere, possibly in some standard like HTML spec.<p>The reason that I bring this up, and have harped on this before, is that when most people design REST they are using HTTP + JSON. The problem is that JSON is not hypermedia. Hopefully it will not become hypermedia. As a result, the systems that are HTTP + JSON are not REST. They are RESTish, but not REST.<p>I think that the terms really have value. That is the purpose of language. If we go about calling things that use POST or Get or PUT + JSON hypermedia, we can start to misapply the thoughts of the thesis.

  He published the entire source code of PGP in a hardback 
  book,[12] via MIT Press, which was distributed and sold 
  widely. Anybody wishing to build their own copy of PGP could 
  buy the $60 book, cut off the covers, separate the pages, and 
  scan them using an OCR program, creating a set of source code 
  text files. One could then build the application using the 
  freely available GNU Compiler Collection. PGP would thus be 
  available anywhere in the world. The claimed principle was 
  simple: export of munitionsguns, bombs, planes, and 
  softwarewas (and remains) restricted; but the export of 
  books is protected by the First Amendment. The question was 
  never tested in court with respect to PGP. In cases 
  addressing other encryption software, however, two federal 
  appeals courts have established the rule that cryptographic 
  software source code is speech protected by the First 
  Amendment (the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in the 
  Bernstein case and the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals in the 
  Junger case).""

Yard Signs come in all shapes and sizes, but are most often rectangular and between 12 and 40 inches on each Sided. Yard Signs are a very effective, fast and inexpensive advertising.

You target local clients in a specific area and interested people call you the same minute you put on a sign. These signs work well and they are in a great demand nowadays.",1330103803

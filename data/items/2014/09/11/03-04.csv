The neighboring developments all have connecting trails of similar size.<p>It all connects into the regional bike trail system which includes a 50 mile paved and marked trail that gets you literally from farmland into the major city and crosses through almost every other sizable city and employment center along the way, each with connecting bike systems of their own. I don&#x27;t know for my county specifically but the neighboring county has something like 500 miles of paved bike trail. I&#x27;m pretty sure my county isn&#x27;t quite that extensive or well integrated but it&#x27;s almost all fairly new, within the last 20 years.<p>It doesn&#x27;t bring every town to within a friendly bike ride, but if you live and work near the 50 mile main trail, it&#x27;s reasonable to bike commute to work every day.<p>The whole system across 3 counties and about 3 million people is something like 20 times the size of Copenhagen&#x27;s to put it into perspective. It&#x27;s just that my taxes mostly cover my local area and we&#x27;re probably at under 100 miles of trail all told or about half what all of NYC has.<p>I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s a lot or not. It&#x27;s not a mirror of the road system in terms of size (which I&#x27;d personally like to change), but it&#x27;s no slouch either.",1410407988

8300804,comment,8298766,8300754,2,0,lesterbuck,,,"No, the GP is correct and &quot;calories consumed >> calories burned&quot; is a gross oversimplification.  For example, one extra Oreo cookie a day ends up in several pounds gained over a year.  Tiny changes in net calories can have very large effects in equilibrium weight.  In addition, it is so easy to say &quot;just eat less&quot;, but it is very (very) well documented that some overweight people can eat less and lose weight, but they are looking at being extremely hungry every second for the rest of their lives.  Once a weight set point has been established, your body can scream at you forever until you regain that weight setting.  So easy for &quot;normal&quot; weight people to say &quot;Just eat less&quot;.",1410407951

And it specifically says that this is about &quot;the first stage of a potential relationship&quot;, at which point you may not know that there&#x27;s a conflict. Indeed, that there&#x27;s a conflict may be unknowable given how young businesses change over time. And an actual conflict of interest is rarely the problem; what clients generally freak about is their <i>perception</i> of a conflict of interest, which novice entrepreneurs can have very broad perceptions of. &quot;You&#x27;re working with another person who sells stuff on the Internet?

But it&#x27;s a typical road that you&#x27;ll find almost anywhere.<p><i>This</i> one at least has some designated space for people on bikes <a href=""http://velotraffic.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/bike-lane.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://velotraffic.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/bike-lane....</a> but it&#x27;s definitely not pedestrian friendly. However it clearly has a &quot;cars go here&quot; and &quot;bikes go here&quot; aspect to the marking design.<p>I would personally love to see every road everywhere at least have that. But I&#x27;d love it if the average road segregated bikes and cars even further. <a href=""http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/960/img/photos/2013/01/13/fd/f3/jwj-Bike-Lane-091.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/960...</a><p>I&#x27;m picking these non-urban pictures on purpose, because cyclists seem to think they only exist in cities and that any problems people have about cyclists comes from angry car drivers in cities or I&#x27;m some asshole with issues with highways or something.

These are an example: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/s/?url=search-alias%3Delectronics&field-keywords=around%20the%20neck%20bluetooth"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/s/?url=search-alias%3Delectronics&fiel...</a><p>I&#x27;ve seen a lot of folks recently wearing around-the-neck Bluetooth headphones. I was really skeptical of them and considered them a fad, but then received one as a present. I have subsequently been blown away by the value and convenience, and now believe that around-the-neck will be an important part of the future in wearable computing. I think the innovation was a combination of being small, light, well designed, effective wireless, long enough battery life, and an unobtrusive place to rest on the body.<p>Advantages:<p>- The absence of wires between my pocket and my head is a HUGE benefit. I now wear the wireless headphones by default, which are super convenient while doing routine activities like chores around the house, or changing clothes, or while traveling between house and car, etc. Wires get in the way and are inconvenient enough to stop me from using headphones (e.g., while buckling a seat-belt, or moving laundry around). Neck headphones are convenient enough to wear by default, and don&#x27;t get in the way.<p>- The device overall is so convenient that I barely notice I&#x27;m wearing them. I frequently fall asleep while wearing them after listening to a book or podcast. They are small and light enough to evaporate from your senses.<p>- They&#x27;re small enough to fit inside most shirts if needed<p>- Being continuously present around my neck removes the pain of unbundling wires from one&#x27;s pocket. Those wires are always tangled. The neck device&#x27;s wires are short and can&#x27;t get tangled. The device magnetically contains its earbugs when not in use, so no dangling wires.<p>- Battery life is good enough that I can use them the whole next day even after leaving them on overnight (assuming audio isn&#x27;t playing all night)<p>- While tethered to a primary device (smartphone or tablet), I can roam almost anywhere within my house within audio reception<p>I&#x27;m listening to audio substantially more now as a result of the device. While I think glasses would be far too intrusive, I&#x27;ve started wearing wireless headphones all day long by default now. I see many people doing it too. I could see these devices either replacing glasses or complementing them (move the processing units out of the glasses frame, and down around the neck, perhaps with an easily detached wire - a wire to the neck is probably doable).<p>What&#x27;s not easy is finding new audio content dynamically while wearing them. I&#x27;m a big audiobook and podcast fan, so I listen to Audible and NPR and the like. But I have to prepare all my content ahead of time on another computing device to which the headphones are tethered. If the headphones were interactive, and commands were available by voice, to find and listen to books, podcasts, or the news, then I think they could form quite the electronic companion.<p>A full phone could probably be designed with that form factor (but no screen). Or imagine if I could control appliances within my house. TV, turn on. Search for &quot;<the latest movie>&quot;. The headphones relay the command to my device, which instructs the house. There&#x27;s a lot of potential there.",1410405859

I sympathize because doing the safe thing and waiting is not only inconvenient but also somewhere between frustrating and infuriating.  But given the picture you linked to, the driver is at fault.<p>Now in the situation where there&#x27;s a 3ft shoulder and the cyclist is riding in it and goes down and falls into the road forcing a driver to make a horrible choice between a bunch of bad options then yes I&#x27;m very sympathetic to the points you make.<p>But in that case the cyclist has 3ft to maneuver and probably doesn&#x27;t hit the rock or the crack or veer or whatever.  Furthermore a cyclist moving along at a decent clip is going to have a very hard time changing directions fast enough to get out into the road and under a car without giving the driver time to react.  Bikes don&#x27;t turn on a dime at 20mph.  If you fall at 20mph you basically keep going in whatever direction you were headed, possibly with limbs flailing.  Your center of mass can&#x27;t just instantly move 3-5 feet perpendicular to the direction of travel.<p>If the cyclist loses control due to some other circumstance then whatever happens is on him for not maintaining control of his vehicle.  Perhaps he could be prosecuted for manslaughter or get sued for wrongful death.  I don&#x27;t have a problem with that; real life has consequences.",1410405167

8300663,comment,8298155,8300576,1,0,bane,,,"So two things. By &quot;intended&quot; I specifically mean the semantics of the travelway. Roads are specifically engineered for cars, full stop. Everything from angle to speed surveys are done specifically for the automobile. Is that a great injustice to other forms of transportation? Perhaps, but that&#x27;s the way it is. It&#x27;s changing, and roads are more commonly being designed and engineered to support other transport options, but there&#x27;s still a long way to go with that.<p>Second, there&#x27;s a very big difference between things being legally allowed and them being wise to do. It is perfectly legal for me to walk in the road along a road with no available sidewalk. Is it wise? Probably not.<p>So the problem I have is that bikes are allowed on roads, but I don&#x27;t think they should be. The cry then is &quot;well where will they go?&quot; and I strongly propose that purpose built bike lines be built to accommodate cyclists. I recognize that it won&#x27;t happen overnight, but it is happening.<p>> It&#x27;s infuriating at times when it&#x27;s a single lane road and cyclists are poking along at 20mph instead of 50mph but the law enshrines this right.<p>The law in most states also specifically forbids impeding traffic (hence the 5 car law you pointed out in some jurisdictions). In others &quot;impeding&quot; is left open to interpretation by an officer of the law. But 20 in a 50 is impeding and I&#x27;d argue that it&#x27;s not only not safe for everybody on the road, but faster vehicles (mopeds and scooters) are not even allowed on such roads (at least in my jurisdiction), which I think it a clear oversight in the law.<p>But bikes get an unbelievable amount of leeway. In situations where other vehicles are prohibited, or pedestrians aren&#x27;t allowed, bikes get a free pass. I&#x27;ve never even heard of a cyclist in my area getting a ticket for anything. But I can sit out on my front porch and watch cyclists run the stop sign in front of my house all day.<p>I think that&#x27;s wrong and I think the right way to deal with it is not to ban bikes, but to give them a better place to go and start enforcing cyclist&#x27;s responsibilities.",1410404631

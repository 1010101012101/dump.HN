Now, Godel&#x27;s completeness theorem shows that you construct complete mathematical system of true statements however such a system requires inserting an infinite number of arbitrarily choices among statements (and their negations) which aren&#x27;t provable given the previous axioms. Since the framework of the article is finite, not infinite, I would claim the framework of the article, being finite, can&#x27;t encompass all true statements of any given system, even if it an algorithm for producing axioms.<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_completeness_theorem"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_completeness_th...</a><p>Edit: I got through the pay-wall via Google but the discussion is somewhere between confused and confusing (the large part of post mostly meaningless speculation about the term &quot;proved in an absolute sense&quot;, that he introduces without defining). The situation is really simple. All formal proof systems have hole (at least those of any reasonable &quot;powerfulness&quot;). Any formal proof system can be expanded indefinitely but at any point in that expansion will still have a hole.",1375559942

6153147,comment,6151500,6153101,6,0,nakedrobot2,,,"Hi OldSchool,<p>Thank you very much.<p>In terms of pixel density: You may have noticed that the &quot;megapixel wars&quot; have pretty much stopped. And even the sensor that I&#x27;ve been using for nearly all of my &quot;world record sized&quot; is the 18-megapixel APS-c (1.6X &quot;crop&quot;) Canon sensor (550D, 7D). The 7D is nearly 4 years old! Only in recent months has Canon released a camera with smaller pixels (the 20 megapixel 70D). Why?<p>One major reason is that lenses can&#x27;t resolve much more than this. Your 10 year old lens that was built for film might not yield any detail at 100% zoom.<p>Another reason is that they are hitting limits with the wavelength of light. Correcting &quot;chromatic aberration&quot; on the sensor at this resolution is becoming a major issue. Each RGB sensor on the camera responds to a range of wavelengths, each one of which gets distorted differently.  These all get mixed together and it&#x27;s definitely not possible to disentangle them.  So, to some degree, CA is impossible to fix completely.<p>These are large sensors and large, expensive lenses we are talking about here. With smaller phone sensors and their tiny lenses, the problem is worse. Looking at all phone photos, there isn&#x27;t really anything interesting at 100% zoom, I think you won&#x27;t lose any detail at all if you make the photo 70% of its original size.<p>To answer your question - it will take a great number of breakthroughs before there is anything like a 10 gigapixel sensor, with a lens that can resolve details for such a sensor.",1375559795

It&#x27;s impossible for any large organization, no matter how &quot;non-evil&quot; to avoid criticism and conspiracies.

6153125,comment,6152781,6152824,8,0,mythz,,,"Dart is a solution for building and maintaining complex web apps. Googles JS web apps has 100&#x27;s of engineers working on it spanning millions LOC. Google doesn&#x27;t think it&#x27;s possible to develop at this scale with vanilla JS which is why they&#x27;ve invested a ton of effort in developing the Closure Compiler/Library and GWT (i.e. what their big JS Web Apps use). The problems with the previous strategies is that they add boilerplate, artefacts and complexity on top of JS that slows down their build times to the point where some devs have to wait 24mins to see a live/edit reload cycle. Dart was built from the ground-up to manage complexity and to provide a consistent development experience with the goal of providing the fastest edit/reload dev cycles possible. As it&#x27;s also built with the input of the VM engineers who helped create StrongTalk, Hotspot JVM, V8 VMs they are able to add features that enable a high-performance VM implementation and enable features like &#x27;Snapshots&#x27; to provide instant start up times.<p>Google will never drop support for their 2 crown jewels, Chrome or Android. When Dart gets into Chrome and some of their big internet properties start to depend on it, you can pretty much guarantee that they&#x27;ll never drop support for it. One of the mandates Google has is to improve the web, make it faster and make it possible for everyone to build richer more interactive web experiences so more people use and spend more time on the Internet. More time on the Internet means more time on Google, so developing and investing in technologies like Dart indirectly benefits them. It&#x27;s also why any investments on improving the Internet remain supported, free and Open Source e.g WebP/M, SPDY, Chromium/Blink, V8, Closure Library, GWT, mod_pagespeed, Polymer and now Dart.<p>People like to confuse Google&#x27;s dropping of support for their products where everything they create is fair game and can be dropped at anytime, what&#x27;s not looked at, is how the product to relates to their entire ecosystem, whether it adds value and is in a growing technology/market.",1375559404

It doesn&#x27;t appear that in the long term it&#x27;s intended to be transcompiled to JavaScript. CoffeeScript is only intended to be an alternative that transcompiles to JS. There&#x27;s no effort to build a CoffeeScript VM. (C8? CoffeeMonkey?)<p>Angular, Ember, etc are just frameworks. They&#x27;re not likely to be as long-lived as the triad of front-end web development technologies because the creation of such a framework has a significantly lower barrier to entry and adoption. There&#x27;s no W3C committee overseeing development and there will be no W3C draft or standard for any of these somewhat ephemeral frameworks.<p>Core web development technologies are very stable and their development, deployment, and adoption happens quite slowly; on the order of decades.

6153098,comment,6152781,6153036,2,0,cromwellian,,,"Dart is no more an attempt to replace the web with a walled garden than GWT is (which is what I work on). It is a tool, like Typescript, like CoffeeScript, like ClojureScript, like Emscripten. There&#x27;s no &quot;plan&quot; to create a lock-in walled garden based around programming language.<p>Google is interested in making the experience of developing web apps better, and making web apps more performant. They have many different strategies for this: Chrome DevTools, AngularJs, Web Components and other spec improvements, Dart, Closure Compiler, GWT, etc. The company does not make money from selling the Chrome browser, and unlike Microsoft, it doesn&#x27;t make money from selling an OS. The incentives are not aligned like the way they were with IE and Windows. At the end of the day, Google makes money from people using the web. The real threat is from the Web falling too far behind Native.<p>Also, the Web is far far bigger than the programming language Javascript. For the first 10+ years of the Web, people hardly even used JS except for form validation, and in general, on mobile, excessive amounts of JS lead to poor performance.<p>There&#x27;s still a ways to go on just HTML and CSS, and I&#x27;d frankly be more concerned about fragmentation in that area rather than fixation on Javascript.<p>The way I see the potential of a DartVM is the same as OdinMonkey+asm.js. Dart compiles to JS, but DartVM will run it slightly faster, but it will always work on all browsers. Likewise, asm.js will work on all browsers, but will always run faster on OdinMonkey. Both Mozilla and Google have VMs that potentially bifurcate performance across browsers, but still produce outputs that can run (albeit slower)<p>The concerns you should have about Google misusing Dart I think should really be about Google misusing market share. It&#x27;s not really Dart per se that&#x27;s the issue, it&#x27;s the fact that if Chrome is the dominant browser, Google can drop anything they want into it, not just Dart, but any APIs they want.",1375558811

After all, it&#x27;s basically Java optimized for shorter time-to-first-demo, so it&#x27;s best suited for small projects.

It spewed out startups of FYIV people in a short period of time.<p>At the time, it was very disruptive to hear that &quot;ex-Microsoft engineers&quot; were entering a market.  There were a few things that seemed pretty common in the groups with which I had contact. (SQL, LAN, VC++, etc.)<p>1) QA as a first class function.  SDETs were awesome, and they tried to staff projects with about two for each SDE.  Testing tools were automated and accounted for huge amounts of code.  Compatibility labs were huge.  Breaking the build would be just short of a flogging offense.<p>2) A focus on maximizing productivity.  Spend the money on the desk that can be raised or lowered.  Spend the money on the newest, latest computers, and give them to anyone who asks, as many as they think they need.  Locate beverages very close to everyone and subsidize outside businesses to provide food services.  Give everyone a window office.  It made it a lot easier to stay there from 8am to whenever.  This also led to the diaspora of startups.<p>3) Scary-ass yelling matches in the hallways.  People who had always felt they were smarter than the jocks and popular people in their youth were suddenly capable of establishing dominance by insulting other people, their intellects, and especially their work.<p>4) Readable code over clever code.  This led to a lot of typedefs like LPCSTWCSRARSARTARSTA[1] and Hungarian notation[2].  So if you see MyMethod(lpszName); somewhere, you&#x27;ll know where that came from.<p>People would leave after vesting (sometimes before and sometimes long after) with the idea of creating a product of their own with the good things that Microsoft taught them and without the bad things that they hated.<p>Very much like when we start thinking about having kids with the intention of not making the mistakes our parents did.<p>[1] Yes, Colemak.<p>[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_notation"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_notation</a>",1375558709

More functionality != more bulk. All new features we add to the app fit nicely with the existing code. We never have to go back and refactor large parts of the app. It&#x27;s the same simple pattern you apply over and over again.

6152984,comment,6133349,6145215,2,0,nulldevnull,,,"The whole reason the USG rescued Cray in the late-1990s/early-2000s was to insure the continued availability of large memory image vector supercomputers. Part of this may have been to it being less costly than converting their processing systems from vector codes and algorithms to massively parallel distributed processing ones. At that time the cluster interconnects were much, much slower in terms of both bandwidth and latency than they are today. Solving very large sparse matrices would have been tougher on an MPP system than on a vector one. You can read about some of this history in Bamford&#x27;s &quot;Shadow Factory.&quot;<p>There have been a number of very cost effective hardware approaches proposed for significant acceleration of both the sieving and linear algebra components of the NFS. Many of these proposals could successfully and cost effectively attack a 1024-bit number in the 2003/2004 era. The process at that time was around 130-nm. Today&#x27;s process would have features at the 32-nm or 22-nm size. Today there has been a 100-fold increase in performance since 2003. (See <a href=""http://tau.ac.il/~tromer/cryptodev/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tau.ac.il/~tromer/cryptodev/</a> for an overview.)<p>Combine this specialized hardware with an algorithmic improvement that gets to O(log n) or O(n log n)....<p>AES appears fine. The NSA and USG in general make a very strong effort in the 2000s to move all civilian command and control systems for satellites to AES-256 with TRANSEC capabilities. A brute force attack on AES-256 with a quantum computer should be on the order of 2^128 operations with currently know QC factoring algorithms. AES-128 looks weak at 2^64.<p>If the NSA can break something, they need to assume that their primary opponents can do so or will do so soon. China specifically comes to mind here. The can not release cryptography suites with known vulnerabilities. It is widely thought that it is more importantly to secure one&#x27;s own signals before intercepting and decrypting one&#x27;s enemies.<p>I think everything on the internet needs to be moved to Suite B protocols with forward secrecy enabled. AES-GCM overcomes all the known attacks (i.e. CRIME) against AES-CBC and AES-CTR.<p>I get the impression that the NSA is eight to ten years ahead of the public domain cryptographers in some areas. I think this gap is shrinking slowly. However, I have also heard that the NSA is preventing publication of some papers developed in the public domain due to national security reasons.",1375556690

6152976,comment,6151030,6151962,2,0,rcthompson,,,"I&#x27;m sorry to say that pretty much all the biological examples and analogies you give are either wrong or at best controversial and not widely accepted. Bacteria do not group to form mitochondria; mitochondria do not group to form cells. Mitochondra don&#x27;t even cooperate &quot;willingly&quot; with their host cells, but rather the host cell must incentivize them by withholding essential nutrients from the &quot;slackers&quot; until they shape up. Insect colonies are not &quot;superorganisms&quot;; the individuals within a colony act selfishly, doing things like secretly laying eggs to propagate their genes and sometimes even trying to &quot;usurp the throne&quot; by killing and replacing the queen. The concept of a &quot;superogranism&quot; as a group of individual organisms that evolve together is not generally accepted by biologists [1]. I&#x27;m not familiar with Jonathan Haidt&#x27;s work, so I can&#x27;t comment directly on that, but your paraphrase above (e.g. &quot;Those that united ... evolved&quot;) sounds suspiciously like group selection, and must answer to the same criticisms [1].<p>The concepts of entropy and order don&#x27;t really apply in a social system. In many industries the only stable equilibrium is a monopoly [2], which is arguably the least entropic &quot;market state&quot; possible. The &quot;optimal&quot; market according to capitalism is perfect competition among a large number of small independent firms, which is arguably the maximum-entropy state. So it seems that increased entropy should be a good thing.<p>The word &quot;prism&quot; has a mathematical meaning and a physical meaning, and I think it&#x27;s pretty clear that when the NSA called their spying program PRISM, they were invoking the physical meaning of a tool that separates light into its components rather than the mathematical meaning of a solid formed by two identical polygons whose sides are connected by parallelograms.<p>This might seem like nitpicking. If it was just a few examples in your post that were slightly inaccurate, I wouldn&#x27;t have cared. But your post is clearly trying to give a bunch of examples in order to establish a pattern, and when nearly all of your examples are wrong in significant ways or based on controversial theories, I feel it undermines your the point you were trying to make.<p>Finally, suggesting that the purpose of a vast surveillance program is anything other than surveillance is going against Occam&#x27;s razor, and doesn&#x27;t seem to make sense to me.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_selection#Criticism"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_selection#Criticism</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_monopoly"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_monopoly</a>",1375556558

Before that can happen, it needs a P2P infrastructure that can handle low-friction commerce. Without that, it&#x27;s stuck in the current model of gatekeeper services, which is what Netflix is, and that makes it hard for smaller players to get involved. DRM worries me because it could enforce the current situation rather than develop it.<p>Getting P2P commerce right is hard, but I&#x27;d like a solution that could enforce small ad-hoc contracts through trust systems. This is basically, &quot;Gain trust for following accepted terms, lose trust for breaking them.&quot;<p>For instance, a music vendor might request that I pay five dollars after download a few albums. If I don&#x27;t, they&#x27;ll signal to their circle of music-vendor peers that I&#x27;m a welcher, and knock down my trust rating in that circle. If I do pay, however, that vendor would signal that I can be trusted, and that might result in discounts or access to higher-value services. Digital goods contracts would then be trust exchanges, and might even influence the topography of the P2P network, as a trusted buyer or seller would expand their available network through good behavior.<p>It&#x27;s still a few steps away, but there&#x27;s going to be a lot more opportunity for it as WebRTC stabilizes.",1375556496

The only time I even notice them is when something interesting catches my eye.<p>There are two reasons not to like ads:  1) They are intrusive/distracting; and 2) They show you stuff you don't care about.  If Facebook can occasionally show me ads for things I might actually want, and if they can do so in a way that doesn't intrude on my browsing experience, kudos to them.<p>Edit:  Oh, forgot to answer your question.  No, I don't think I've ever seen an ad on Google that interested me.  I don't really use Google to find things to buy, though.",1235167170

The author seemingly doesn't realize that Facebook does not force you to input every minor detail of your life nor does it force you to spend your entire evenings in the perusal of its pages. When one checks Facebook merely periodically, and rarely updates, there are times when it comes in mighty handy, and it's silly for this man to write the whole service off to everyone else because he doesn't believe that anyone can use Facebook moderately (for the record, I log in to check things about twice a week and update my profile about twice a year).<p>Even less sensibly, the author also hates Facebook because he doesn't see an immediately obvious plan for profitability.

I'm not trying to snark; I'm genuinely interested in what people find difficult about Git, that much more it's possible to ""fix"".<p>If there's something complex that you think should be easy, you always have two basic options:
 - create an alias in your ~/.gitconfig linking a short command name to a long command/argument sequence
 - create a shell script in /usr/libexec/git-core (or the equivalent) that does what you want, and you can instantly use that in the standard `git <command>` method.<p>For an example, I have aliased 'co' to 'checkout', 'ci' to 'commit -a', 'pullr' to 'pull --rebase', and 'fp' to 'format-patch --binary'.",1235163930

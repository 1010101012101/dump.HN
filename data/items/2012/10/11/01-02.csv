4639029,comment,4635618,4638820,1,0,dfox,,,"My point is that GPUs have significantly different architecture from most of these ""many cores on a chip"" designs. Original reason for that was clearly that such architecture was necessary for graphics, coincidentally it works better for many interesting HPC workloads. It's clear that manufacturers are introducing technologies that are not required for graphics, but they cannot be expected to do modifications that will make their GPUs unusable for graphics.<p>And as for SIMD/SIMT, I mentioned SIMD mostly in relation to operations on short vectors done by one thread, which is mostly irrelevant to overall architecture of the core, as it can very well be implemented by pure combinational logic in one cycle given enough space. My mental model of how modern GPU core (physical, not logical) actually works is essentially some kind of simplistic RISC/VLIW design with large amounts of registers with compiler and or hardware interleaving instructions of multiple threads into one pipeline, which may or may not be how it actually works but it looks probable to me.<p>In my opinion most of chips like Epiphany IV or XMOS or whatever, in contrast to GPUs, are useful for only limited classes of workloads as they tend to be memory starved.",1349920528

Gruber goes into that a little (which is insightful), however as most typography related discussions I see, it often comes down to ""I prefer this or that and so don't like how they used this other one instead.""  But why?  Do cases exist where it is strictly personal preference? In that case why bother pointing it out?  Or is the actual reason not known?  Or is it laziness?<p>Typography-tuned-people often claim there's a right way and wrong way, which is probably true.  However it's fascinating to think that a vast majority of people aren't tuned into the existence of the subtleties, affected (true?), or care about most of the subtleties -- possibly because the actual impact it has is very very minimal.

Rather than model each quark and gluon explicitly, you could just model probabilistic interactions at much larger scales. Maybe put in some special case handling so that if an observer within our simulated universe were to go looking for quarks and gluons, they'd find them. If they looked hard enough, some gaps might show: since subatomic particles are not actually being simulated in a continuously deterministic fashion, it would never be possible to observe both position and velocity simultaneously. An observer looking at an electron shell in two discrete moments would not be able to track a continuous orbit between them, since they'd actually just be seeing two separate expansions of what is effectively a lossy compression algorithm.<p>Also, it ought to be possible to model only the macroscopic dimensions explicitly, replacing the other seven microscopically enfolded dimensions with a bunch of arbitrary constants that accomplish more or less the same thing. Might drive our observers a bit batty, because those constants would <i>appear</i> to refer to a bunch of microscopic enfolded dimensions, which they'd never actually be able to detect.<p>Right, now I'm starting to freak myself out...",1349920170

I don't personally have much use for Zynga's games or their business model, so I am aware that I might undervalue them somewhat, but what the the numbers tell me is that they are a poor business to invest in even at this ""low"" price.

Come on, you don't mean that, do you?<p>When I worked for a startup, I only considered my salary in my financial decisions. This also meant that I could switch jobs and be reasonably certain that my standard of living wouldn't change. We were offered equity as well, and the agreement we had to sign had several provisions that I could only describe as being pro-founder/anti-employee. For example:<p>1. Upon termination of employment (for any reason), the company can buy back your shares at book price, whether you like it or not. In other words: You'll never see a big payout from your work if you go.<p>2. There should be no expectation of a market for the shares in the company, and there may never be one. Again, good luck selling those shares.<p>3. The founder has the right to sell his shares, but employees have no tag-along right. So even if the company is sold, you will probably not be able to cash in at that point, since your labor/skill are part of the sale.<p>4. The employees' shares are subject to dilution. How much dilution? Who knows, maybe 1%, maybe 99%, whatever's good in the view of the founders.<p>This stuff is pretty standard, too. What I don't get though is how people will make multi-decade (i.e. mortgage, kids) financial decisions on a benefit that's this uncertain. Instead of actual equity, they could just say ""we'll give you more money later if we get rich and feel like it"". At least it would be more honest.",1349917490

I just up and left one day, so take that for what it's worth.<p>But I did spend a lot of time hiring, coaching, and observing junior engineers of all stripes.<p>At junior levels, I don't think it's about MS v Startup as much as ""Big Company v Startup"".  As Steve Blank says, startups aren't minified big companies, they are a different species.<p>On balance, I still believe a bigger company is a better place for a first job than a startup.  This is not a rule, but a preference.<p>My main reason for this is that the number one goal of a new engineer is learning to be a better engineer.  On balance, this happens faster when you're in the presence of more senior folks to mentor and challenge you.<p>If you're doing a startup with a bunch of folks with similar experience levels, you'll learn plenty but you'll also bake in some bad habits.<p>A corallary, as noted here, is that a larger company pays you and let you focus on your core job role, versus ""wearing many hats"", which is great for someone who's got some things down pat, and not so great for n00bs.<p>This is a vast generalization and frankly there are some caveats here with MS in particular (and maybe others, n=1) that might get in the way, but in general I think structure is good until you're really equipped to make a run.<p>My first job was at a startup and I came to this conclusion when I left there 1996, and nothing in between has changed my mind.",1349917231

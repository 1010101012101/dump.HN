It&#x27;s scary because this stuff causes neurodegeneration and excess oxidation of dopamine to DOPAC , which increases axidative stress on your mitochondria that could drastically increase your odds of having Parkinsons latter in life, and this isnt even mentioning the toll this stuff takes on your cardiovascular system along with having kidneys that feel like beans due to peripheral effects.

9345606,comment,9345452,9345452,0,0,curryhoward,,,"When most practitioners think of &quot;typechecking&quot;, they typically think about proving properties about programs statically. This project seems equivalent to adding a runtime check at each call site to ensure the arguments and return values are the correct type.<p>This is certainly useful sometimes, as it gives programs the desirable &quot;fail fast&quot; property. But it isn&#x27;t &quot;typechecking&quot; as most engineers understand it. Or at least, it should be clarified that this is run-time typechecking. As such, it negatively impacts runtime performance, unlike compile-time typechecking.<p>This project also seems to miss the primary opportunity of run-time type checking: checking properties that are difficult to prove statically! For example, checking that a number is even, that a string is lowercase, that an index is within the bounds of an array, etc. These exotic types require a dependent type system to be checked statically, but in a dynamic environment they are trivial to verify.<p>Two suggestions for improvement: 1) add &quot;sum&quot; types (i.e., discriminated unions), and 2) let the user define their own types via lambdas, such as PrimeNumber.",1428548369

Imagine a couple years ago, when Gruber couldn&#x27;t even bring himself to pretend to provide critical analysis of Apple products. I used to just flag daringfireball posts as soon as I saw them. These days there&#x27;s at least information content in his posts so I usually leave them alone.<p>But Gruber also spends an extraordinary amount of time these days using framing devices to either draw false comparisons that put Apple on top, or minimize the cases where Apple clearly screwed up. You could easily cut this review down by 2/3rds just by getting rid of the superfluous framing he uses throughout and not lose any information at all. The amount of hemming and hawing in this makes me think that he&#x27;s not really buying it this time. It&#x27;s not a crap device, but it&#x27;s not clear what it&#x27;s good for and it&#x27;s not strictly better than just a normal watch. He didn&#x27;t really effuse about Apple&#x27;s stated use-cases for the device. His hope throughout is that maybe it&#x27;ll appeal to non-watch wearers?<p>You&#x27;ll also notice that he carefully doesn&#x27;t compare it to all the other smart watches in the growing segment. He pretends like it only is comparable to regular watches, like the Apple watch was introduced into a market vacuum, cut from whole cloth (Apple&#x27;s magical genius cloth), and completely uninformed by the three decades of smartwatch development.",1428548322

Recently I&#x27;ve been using the mantra &quot;design transcends (choice of) technology&quot; and nowhere is it more apparent than with front-end frameworks. Using React or whatever is hot will not make much of a difference at scale if the application is not well designed.

Yeah, it talks about how much you work hard, but even just listen to them:<p>> I mean, it’s not that it’s not fun, it’s not that it’s not fulfilling, it’s not that you don’t get to work around all these brilliant people. The bad side effect is they’re all, like, workaholic, psychotic brilliant people.<p>For me, one of the best things in life is the opportunity to work hard at work worth doing.  Apple gives me that, and I feel extremely fortunate.<p>I&#x27;ve been at jobs where the stress is very low and I had time to browse the internet at all hours and didn&#x27;t have much expected of me.  This is 100% the opposite of that, and I&#x27;m happier now than I ever was then.  It&#x27;s been 4 years and I&#x27;ve never had anything close to burn-out, because I&#x27;ve never felt that the work wasn&#x27;t &quot;worth it&quot;.  (To me, burn out is a result of feeling like you&#x27;re not getting anywhere, and that just plain isn&#x27;t the case at a company where we consistently ship things with huge scopes, on time and to resounding success.)<p>Yeah, there&#x27;s exec demos, and yeah there&#x27;s dry-run meetings for them, but you know what?

Every meeting I&#x27;ve had with execs has left me awestruck at the level with which someone can be simultaneously so big-picture oriented while still being able to sweat little details.

It may be accurate, but it&#x27;s overly complex, fussy and unreliable to get it to show you the time.<p>- The water resistance is unacceptable for a device intended as a fitness companion, some of this is due to compromises to the overly complex design.<p>- As a watch targeting people who wear watches, it&#x27;s probably a failure. He repeats some variation of this a number of times.<p>- the build quality feels high, not as high as the early press hands-on<p>- the rubber watch band is easy to size and the material feels good, but swapping out bands is &quot;fiddly&quot;<p>- the watch is designed to hide the bezel, but in good lighting you can see it, again reminding that it isn&#x27;t a great watch<p>- the shape (square) is not a good watch shape<p>- the gender-neutral design comes off as modern<p>- battery life will get you through a day of moderate usage<p>- the induction charger is easy to use and works as advertised<p>- one of the main marketing points, that it&#x27;s a health and fitness device, is not useful to him in any way and he has no interest in it<p>- some of the fitness features intrude into non-fitness uses in a bad way<p>- other fitness features seem pretty accurate and potentially useful<p>- the digital crown works basically like a mouse scroll-wheel<p>- touch, the crown and haptic feedback work as well as you&#x27;d expect and they work together well<p>- haptic feedback works so well that you can turn off sound for notifications<p>- he had a 50% failure rate on the haptic feedback on his test watches requiring him to get a replacement watch during his week-long review<p>- the digital touch features were untested, though he provides a cute story of two rich teenagers flirting in class he provides no actual coverage of the feature<p>tl;dr none of the smart watch features were particularly interesting and it&#x27;s not a great watch to use for time keeping<p>It&#x27;s not really surprising, it&#x27;s the same problem all the smart watches have, it&#x27;s not really clear that the extra expense and fuss of a smartwatch, on a severely compromised display and interaction platform is worth it. The target audience he holds out hope for, non-watch wearers who wouldn&#x27;t know any better, are probably not going to start wearing an expensive fussy fiddly device that provides no unqualified benefit that they have to charge every day.

Original ripple was a great response, though without providing a strong solution to the topology problem (manual processes for trust agility).<p>Now, both fail to &quot;do one thing and do it well&quot;. Fundamentally, the functions &#x27;settlement protocol&#x27;, &#x27;currency&#x27; and &#x27;client program&#x27; (ie. implementation of protocol) should be well delimited. Besides these, Bitcoin now effectively attempts to do more (expensive paid public sequential datastore and agent-based computing platform, ill-conceived invoicing system, future revenue-guarantees for early adopters/special nodes, etc.)<p>This brings me to some points I feel have not been considered in this thread: (1) People don&#x27;t put absolute trust in a settlement network or currency. The de-facto means of managing risk is to simply to limit exposure: either by sending smaller amounts sequentially over time and validating delivery with your endpoint (out of band) prior to sending the next &#x27;chunk&#x27;; or by splitting a transaction across multiple currencies/settlement networks/(anonymous/temporary/unpredictable) points of network connectivity. (2) No system fits all people. It&#x27;s great that the stellar notion addresses one of Bitcoin&#x27;s most glaring issues: latency for real time / retail transactions. However, it does not necessarily meet all of Bitcoin&#x27;s capabilities, nor should it aim to. A real world user should have a computationally available means of comparing these networks against real time requirements to select an appropriate path (in terms of risk mitigation strategy, temporal requirements, maximum transaction size limitations, secrecy requirements, and any other execution and routing goals/preferences). (3/corollary) The key issue in present-era financial systems may be that business logic around the true properties of a financial transaction, network or settlement partner are very rarely formally defined (ie. typically many pages of indecipherable legalese that amount to &#x27;we promise nothing and have well paid lawyers&#x27;, with no computationally usable community metric for SLA enforcement on latency, reliability, instances of failure, etc.)<p>My thoughts here have remained fairly constant for the last four years: what is <i>really</i> needed is a business-level transaction protocol that disclaims any affinity at all for (a) the currency or currencies in a transaction; (b) the settlement systems used; (c) the endpoint identification system used; (d) allows the discussion/agreement of a realistic range of resolution strategies for common problems in business-level transactions; and (e) facilitates flexible (indeed, multi-path) routing between endpoints across arbitrary financial service providers, potentially using multi-hop/multi-asset pathways shortlisted in real-time through actor and transaction-specific requirements.<p>A valid settlement path should be &#x27;buy expensive art, get on a plane, deliver to mansion&#x27;. Likewise, a valid settlement path should be &#x27;plant a tree and share the GPS location and have it manually validated by a third party&#x27;. (These are outlying examples, but an example of the degree of flexibility that should be aimed for in the long tail of latency and use cases. The shorter side is obvious: redundant multi-provider fiscal routing (even across conventional banks), level playing field for emergent financial systems and the conventional ones, etc.)<p>Some time ago I tried to make proposals in this area at <a href=""http://ifex-project.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ifex-project.org/</a> (IIBAN perhaps most successfully) but have not been able to dedicate much time to the notion lately. I do however feel it is relevant and am willing to jump at any time to work with others to move the notion forward.

9345464,comment,9344711,9345112,0,0,deciplex,,,"For someone whose been flooding this thread with complaints about the EFF misrepresenting the ESA, you&#x27;re being awfully disingenuous here. Here&#x27;s the passage:<p>> EFF’s discussion of “matchmaking” services and multiplayer-modes is also misguided. The video game industry utilizes access controls in order to offer robust, interconnected online experiences that supplement game play. These immersive gaming experiences leverage users’ Internet connectivity to provide a suite of online network features to gamers. These features can include, for example, not only multiplayer game play, but also chat communications, sharing of user-generated content, leaderboards, points, badges and other achievement markers. Online network features for sports games might update roster information in real time to reflect injuries, trades or even increases or decreases in skill. And the online services may enable users to download customized outfits or other downloadable content. Some modern games, such as Minecraft, enable the user to create the very world that the player, and others, inhabit. Still other games may use cloud servers to offload core game calculations to create more realistic game experiences. Significantly, however, all of these online network services generally are entirely distinct services that the user must register for―and sometimes pay for―separately and are not included in the purchase of the video game. Consequently, contrary to EFF’s assertions, multiplayer gameplay over the Internet is not a “core” functionality of the video game, and permitting circumvention to access such functionality would provide the user greater benefits than those bargained and paid for.<p>Most of this passage is a correct summary of basic facts, however the conclusion at the end does not at all follow - not even close - and you know it. Multiplayer is not about achievements, rosters, cloud computing such as with SimCity, or getting a new outfit in Minecraft. For some games, without multiplayer <i>there is no game</i>. There are games like the Modern Warfare series with a single-player component, however the marketing for these focuses very heavily on the multiplayer aspect, and the multiplayer aspect is why people buy them. Then there are games like Tribes, or World of Warcraft of course, which don&#x27;t even have a single-player aspect. For such titles, without multiplayer support the game simply <i>ceases to be</i>.<p>But not only have they intentionally left out a <i>huge</i> part of what makes a game multiplayer, they have not even justified their dismissal of what <i>they claim</i> makes a game multiplayer! So if a game is designed in such a way that it must make use of off-site computational resources to work - leaving aside for a moment that usually when that claim is made, it&#x27;s bullshit (cf SimCity) - I should not be able to simulate this resource somehow after the publisher of the game denies it to me? If a sports game can update its reference data to look at more recent statistics for players, injuries, etc., then after the publisher stops updating this reference data, I should not be allowed to update it myself? If I want to share Minecraft skins or maps or mods or whatever with my friends, I must rely on Microsoft to provide that functionality, or lose it? Whether you agree with these claims or not, these are points that must be argued, not asserted as the ESA has done here.<p>Frankly, after reading the EFF article, I had a low opinion of the ESA. I already had this opinion before reading the article, actually. And you are right that my impression of the ESA argument after reading only the EFF article was &quot;the ESA thinks an exception would enable piracy&quot;. However, now that I am reading the ESA brief, I see that it is <i>so much worse</i>. If your objective is to defend the ESA here, I do not think getting people to read the ESA brief is such a great idea for you.",1428545608

9345425,comment,9345254,9345254,0,0,xrstf,,,"A few things I noticed while reading through the readme:<p>* For me to consider using a PHP library in 2015, it <i>must</i> support Composer.<p>* Currently, a lot of the API is static. This makes it hard to inject the template engine as a helper into some other code. Personally, I would prefer a non-static API.<p>* The template and cache paths seem to be fixed to the location of the library. If this becomes a Composer package, they must be configurable.<p>* From looking at the syntax, how does your library compare to Twig? Sure, the setup process for Twig (initializing the environment, template loader, cache and stuff) is a bit more work, but after that, it&#x27;s as easy as ``$twig->render(&#x27;mytemplate.twig&#x27;, [...data...])``. (Plus, Twig has some nice syntactic sugar, like an else-clause for loops.)<p>* Is there automatic HTML encoding? This is one of the most compelling reasons for me to use a template engine. Whether or not stuff is automatically encoded, this should be mentioned prominently in the readme so that users don&#x27;t create insecure templates.<p>* On a really completely personal note: I don&#x27;t like ``.tpl`` as a file extension. It&#x27;s too generic. It&#x27;s like naming my PHP class files ``.class`` -- IMO the extension should indicate the file syntax/type, not the file&#x27;s purpose. Plus if I look at your roadmap, using .tpl might be a problem when you support JavaScript as well.<p>[Edit] I just noticed how negative this all reads. Please take it as constructive cristicism rather than me bashing your work. :)",1428544905

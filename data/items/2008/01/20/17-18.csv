101264,comment,101106,101225,0,0,eas,,,"The only problem is that these funds don't start out trying to be correlated with each other--the most successful strategies are those that no one else is doing, since you, tautologically, get the best prices on broadly undervalued assets. They don't want to hold all the same things, but finance is a small world at people catch on to successful strategies pretty quickly. It just pans out that way since they are built on analyzing historical relationships between assets and what has worked in the past, e.g., buy refiners when the crack spread widens, or high p/e/g ratio stocks. To be independent you'd have to either find that relationship no one knows about, or pick a strategy that hasn't worked in the past.<p>To put it in web terms, it's almost like these quant funds are just adapting to industry best practices. We see that people like social networking, crowdsourcing, ""web 2.0"" page layouts, etc., so we see lots of sites racing to add these features--because hey, that's what works, that's what users want. But what happens if people get sick of one of those features (or any other you pick)? The relationship between the market and that feature breaks down. All those sites who counted on that strategy will all fail (or adapt) at around the same time, and many will rush into the next hot area (Pointcast-style ""push"" technology, anyone?).<p>Quant funds are basically just advanced machine-learners; you could implement a black box-of-sorts on your website by looking at Comscore numbers/trends for different sites and plotting that out against the features/layouts/topics they use, and instantly adding some new widget to your sidebar or something when you see a positive relationship with traffic generation. (Techmeme is a great example of a web black box, BTW, always on the hottest tech trend.)",1200850322

101262,comment,101106,101225,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Everybody in the industry thought that their black-boxes were uncorrelated and independent.  That was part of the appeal of them (and also why it's so difficult to sell algorithmic trading products - most firms want to develop them in-house).  Problem was that they had no idea what everyone else was doing, and so most of them independently invented algorithms that behave fairly similarly.<p>It's like the thousands of entrepreneurs that saw Friendster and said ""Oh look, only one competitor in the market, I'll build myself a social network and get rich!""  Or the thousands of entrepreneurs that saw Reddit and Digg and said ""Oh look, only two competitors in the market, I'll build myself a social bookmarking site and get rich!""  Or the thousands of entrepreneurs that saw YouTube and said ""Oh look, only one competitor in the market, I'll build myself a video sharing site and get rich!""<p>The only way to get rich is to build things where there are <i>zero</i> popular competitors in the market, or where there are 1-2 competitors and everyone believes it's fruitless to compete with them.  Otherwise, you can bet that thousands of people you haven't heard of are doing the same thing, and by the time you get a product out they'll be getting a product out too.<p>(Incidentally, the first few quant hedge funds, like Renaissance or D.E. Shaw, made out like bandits.)",1200849698

101259,comment,101106,101211,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I was at a financial software firm that was doing half of that.  We were basically analyzing what the ""dumb"" black boxes were doing, but instead of trying to do the opposite, we just compared it with some well-known benchmarks so firms could see if their algorithms were actually doing well.  At the moment, nobody actually knows what these black boxes are doing or whether they're actually performing better than the market as a whole.<p>While I was there, I thought about doing a product that'd try to predict the algorithms other people were using and profit off them, but you run into some really thorny epistemological problems.  For starters, you generally can't find out which firms are making which trades, unless you're the firm itself (that's how our analysis product worked; it was for firms to evaluate their own performance, not their competitors).  Most buy-side firms aggregate their orders through a few brokers, which keep their clientns' identities confidential.  So you see ""A sell order for 100 shares of MSFT at $33.01 came through Morgan Stanley"", but you have no idea which fund placed the order or what other trades came from them.  The signal gets lost in the statistical noise of all the other trades.<p>There's also no absolute standard of value in finance.  Sure, you can benchmark values against discounted cash flow (assuming that you can even predict the cash flows, which is far from certain for most companies), but it may take years for a stock to revert to fair value as measured by discounted cash flow.  Many of these automated trading systems operate over minutes or <i>seconds</i>, and don't care that the stock will eventually crash in 2-3 years.",1200849025

7402243,comment,7401564,7401564,6,0,drakaal,,,"Ok, so let&#x27;s start with. No.<p>For a number of reasons. &quot;Web Scale deployments&quot; like Linked-in and Pay-Pal aren&#x27;t actually what most people call Enterprise. The line blurs a bit, but because they are Massive Scale Single Task solutions they aren&#x27;t what the industry defines as enterprise.<p>Second. Node is use primarily in two places, Private Cloud. (like pay pal and linked in) where you want to run on hardware as a commodity, but don&#x27;t want the overhead of a true VPS, instead you run in an &quot;Engine&quot; which is hardware independent.  That&#x27;s great if you are Huge. But it makes less sense in traditional enterprise... Which is why we come to number 3....<p>Third. Node isn&#x27;t secure enough for Enterprise. Enterprise runs on well tested, secure, solutions, with strong support, because... You can&#x27;t get hacked, you can&#x27;t deal with your developer quitting, and you can&#x27;t deal with the solution is no longer supported.<p>This piece is marketing hype, not &quot;white paper fact&quot; or even &quot;Case study support&quot;<p>Yes I expect lots of downvotes, happens every time I say something bad about node. But the truth of it is that Node is for Hackers, not for production. It is tech born from a poorly conceived language, running in an engine that was designed for clients not servers, and unless you have a team of security guys, and a strong proxy, and a bunch of other things, it is not &quot;production safe&quot;.",1394834237

Now I&#x27;m careful not to let anybody know when I graduated from college or how old I am. I know I am more expensive than a lot of them. If I were in the shoes of management I would be looking hard at more expensive employees and assessing whether they were worth it. I interviewed at a place I&#x27;d have liked to make a move to, recently, but they passed and I have to wonder if their decision was to do with my being older and/or asking for too much money.<p>Emotionally, it&#x27;s definitely harder to get excited about the new next hot thing. I&#x27;m not sure there&#x27;s a lot more in coding that I am super excited about. I could see getting out of development.

7402230,comment,7401833,7402006,37,0,mbrubeck,,,"Firefox for Metro was pretty much what you described -- at least, that was our goal.  It has a very simple UI, which is very similar in spirit to IE11 for Metro.<p>However, this meant adding entire new input/graphics/widget backends to the Gecko platform using a combination of WinRT and Win32 APIs, and a long slog to get those stable and responsive enough to ship to millions of users.  And designing and build a new UI (even a minimal one) means we don&#x27;t get existing desktop Firefox features &quot;for free&quot; -- stuff like private browsing, add-ons, bookmarking, password management, sync...<p>Even minimal browsers have a surprisingly large surface area if you want them to be usable for daily browsing.  We cut out a lot of that stuff for the first release, but that also means we had a long road ahead toward a feature set that was competitive with other browsers (including desktop Firefox, or Firefox for Android).  And that&#x27;s not even getting into technical issues with the Metro environment, like the inability to run the NPAPI version of Flash Player...<p>Just as one example:  When writing a browser, you need to do your own text rendering and layout.  That means you can&#x27;t rely on the OS to handle things like select/copy/paste.  So you end up implementing your own touch-friendly selection UI, and making it match the OS behavior as much as possible.  This turns out to be a minefield of subtleties and edge cases.",1394834089

Every single artist, musician, movie studio, and producer in the world will beat a path to your door, frantically scrambling for their checkbooks and trembling as they hover over a check with the pen asking &quot;how much?!? how much!??&quot; They will break into your house and shove cash down your throat while you sleep.<p>I know a good number of writers, artists, and musicians. Do any of you six-figure-earners have <i>any</i> idea how insanely hard it is to even make a living doing anything &quot;creative?&quot; I mean a basic living: food, shelter, occasional transportation. Nothing infuriates these people more than clueless techies with (to them) <i>unimaginable</i> earning power braying on about how they should live off charity or touring revenues so &quot;information can be free.&quot; <i>You try it</i>, and no open source does not count. Open source is a resume item that helps you land your next six-figure gig, not to mention the fact that it can be monetized in other ways... ways that unlike tip jars actually work. (Services, training, dual-licensing, etc.)<p>Oh sure, yeah, the record industries and Hollywood make more than the artists. Everyone knows that. In the past, the record company or the studio made most of the money and the artist got too little. But now with piracy the artist gets <i>zero</i>. Is that a step in the right direction? We&#x27;ve gone from artists having to suck up to shady promoters to artists not even having shady promoters to suck up to.<p>Why is there so much crappy music on the radio? Because the people who like it are either too young or too dumb to pirate it.<p>And this is coming from someone who&#x27;s written peer to peer apps. I am pretty liberal in this area. I do not believe a technology should be interfered with just because it could potentially be used for piracy. If we did that, we&#x27;d have to shut down the whole Internet. But there&#x27;s a difference between designing an app that <i>can</i> be used for piracy and designing one whose entire focus and modus operandi is to promote piracy front and center. It may not be illegal but it&#x27;s a dick move. Let&#x27;s see you work for &quot;voluntary contributions,&quot; assholes.<p>To add douche to the nozzle, there&#x27;s people in here congratulating the Popcorn Time authors on how brilliant they are by leveraging this for publicity. That&#x27;s wonderful. Now these folks who did little more than hack together some node.js scripts with a front end will go out and make well above $100k while musicians struggle to pay rent for tiny closets in the ghetto. So the MPAA might have harassed them. Boo hoo. Go blow your nose into your hordes of cash.<p>Maybe the end of copyright as we know it is technologically inevitable. But in the meantime it shows more than a little bit of ignorance, naiveté, and douchebaggery to congratulate each other on destroying peoples&#x27; livelihoods en masse. Maybe instead all you hackers could bend your considerable intellects toward trying to solve this problem in a productive way that actually helps creators get paid while also making it easy for people to enjoy their work.

We briefly had a &quot;what&#x27;s new&quot; page that promoted Metro for users of Firefox Aurora on Windows 8, but we never did a similar promotion on the larger Firefox Beta channel.  We had another in-product promotion planned for after the release of Firefox 28, but that&#x27;s no longer in the cards.<p>In the absence of that, we have to rely on metrics from desktop Firefox (e.g. what portion of our users are running it on the touch hardware that our Metro app was designed for) and on any data we can get about the PC industry as a whole.<p>I&#x27;m torn about this decision (understandably, I think), and I still think that Microsoft has a good chance of eventually building a much larger user base for its touch platforms.  But the improvements we wanted to make to the Metro browser (like making the scrolling as smooth as possible) would have required ongoing work not just from my team but from other groups like the graphics and layout teams, whose energy may be better used on other platforms (desktop, Android, Firefox OS).

If you&#x27;re not, a shell script is not going to be deterministic or maintainable - but most companies these days are just using AWS with an ubuntu AMI and then running some software on top x100 for each server. The solution to this has been generally very complex deployment and management programs that you need a devops team to keep maintained.<p>For something like this, you&#x27;d start up an instance, ssh in, set up the server using bash, grab your commands out of bash history into a script, and then deploy 100x instances and have them all run the script. Simple enough anybody who has used unix now understands your whole ops setup. It doesn&#x27;t have the perfect rigor that other solutions have - but sometimes that high learning curve and perfect rigor means that you miss the forest for the trees.",1394832916

On your popular torrent site virtually the same product is available for $0 + (riskOfGettingCaught * $1,000,000 fine) = $0.000001 ?<p>You can either try to increase the riskOfGettingCaught or decrease the legal price.<p>I think the industry should do what Hulu has done over the past 5 years. Give the product away virtually for free, collect an enormous user base while you starve/kill the demand for the equivalent torrents, slowly increase the price of the service until you find equilibrium, then profit.<p>But hey, maybe piracy isn&#x27;t really a problem? The greatest assumption people make is that because someone downloaded a movie illegally they were willing to buy it for $20. Which is false. I&#x27;d have to imagine that selling &#x27;The Wolf of Wall Street&#x27; for $20 on Amazon is more profitable than selling it for say $19 and capturing a few pirate consumers.<p>But I wonder if theres a number between $0 and $19 that captures enough of the piraters to be more profitable than $20?",1394832817

Despite solving problems for teams in Singapore, Chicago, and New York, with recognition from the CTO of the company, I never got a performance review higher than &quot;meets expectations&quot;.  Are you fucking kidding me?<p>* Uncompetitive compensation.  Google pays me twice as much as BAC.  The peer bonuses I&#x27;ve received at Google sum to more than I ever got in real bonuses or raises at BAC.<p>* No perks whatsoever.  People got notes from building management for having too many figures on their desks.  Want coffee?  Leave and buy it.  Want food at 6pm?  Leave and buy it, except you&#x27;re in the financial district, so just give up and go home.<p>(They were so intent on cost cutting that they actually installed waterless urinals.

New creatives who are kickstarting and bootstrapping lean towards the former, and are fine with relinquishing control if it means they get sales at all. Old guard suits are banking on a statistically predictable return rate, and focus on reducing risks to that return, even at the cost of additional short-term profits or long-term goodwill.<p>Of course, the fact that Veronica Mars was kickstarted puts a hole in my theory. :) I&#x27;m guessing that its stakeholders are still partially in the old guard mindset, and/or they&#x27;re trusting Hollywood&#x27;s &quot;best practices&quot; for digital distribution.

7402006,comment,7401833,7401833,32,0,AaronFriel,,,"This is an understandable decision from Firefox&#x27;s perspective. Windows 8/8.1 are\nokay on tablets, but if the interface and implementation requires a lot of\npolish, they need the user base to get it there.<p>I think one problem with Metro adoption has actually been the way one browser\nvendor in particular treated its users. I&#x27;m talking, of course, of Google\nChrome. For a long period of time, reinstalling Chrome meant getting dropped\ninto a hideous, single-window &quot;Metro&quot; implementation that offered none of the\nbenefits of the environment, and every downside. I would prefer to use IE\nin full screen mode over &quot;Chrome in Windows 8 Mode&quot; and that&#x27;s saying something.<p>Now Google&#x27;s &quot;Windows 8 Mode&quot; is essentially a ChromeOS implementation in\nWindows, which I sort of think is cool, and mostly think is just perplexing for\nusers.<p>I wonder why no one - Mozilla, Google, Opera - has implemented exactly what IE\ndoes. A very simple interface with not a lot of bells and whistles, an address\nbar, a tab picker, and a full screen browser. Maybe it&#x27;s because Google Chrome\ndoesn&#x27;t seem to work well with multitouch - support seems to be based on the\nwhims of the version number - and Mozilla&#x27;s engine similarly seems to have\ninteractivity issues.<p>As a result, I get the feeling when using these browsers on a Surface Pro that\nno one at Google or Mozilla is too. For over a year, pinch to zoom and other\nmulti-touch gestures didn&#x27;t work on Chrome. Or they would on Canary or Dev, but\nonly for a few weeks, before suddenly not working again. Pinch to zoom is\nabhorrent on Firefox - a clunky experience that makes me regret doing it every\ntime. And scrolling requires two fingers on Firefox - or at least it does in\nNightly now - and so for the longest time I thought it didn&#x27;t work at all. I\ndon&#x27;t know why they&#x27;ve decided their browser is the only one that needs two\nfingers to scroll. Chrome works terribly on a mid to high DPI display. I can&#x27;t\nfor the life of me close a tab.<p>The result is clunky. Users don&#x27;t want clunky things. Chrome defaulting to Metro\nmode for Windows 8 users during a period when the browser barely or\nintermittently supported touch leaves me with only foul things to say to a Chrome dev\nor their program manager if I ever meet one. Likewise, I can&#x27;t understand why\nFirefox is making Firefox in Metro a major project - give me a full screen\ninterface to Gecko with a big address bar at the top or bottom and let me use\nthat.<p>EDIT: WHOA! Firefox Nightly&#x27;s (30.x) Windows 8 mode is actually decent. Pinching to zoom doesn&#x27;t inflict masochistic terrors on me, and one finger is all that&#x27;s necessary to scroll.

7401996,comment,7401029,7401029,92,0,grellas,,,"Paternalistic meddling with free consumer choices is always fraught with peril.<p>Sometimes it is necessary to protect important principles in society. You can&#x27;t discriminate based on race - that limits choice but who would support the contrary? You can&#x27;t defraud people in selling products - ditto. You can&#x27;t buy land to build a smokestack plant in a quiet residential neighborhood - ditto. Many other examples might be cited. In all such cases, the law intervenes to limit private choices. And there are few who would not applaud most such limits. Private choice is not the end all and be all of a society.<p>Yet, in a free society, private choice should be the overwhelming norm and it should require surmounting very large barriers before legal meddling can limit the choices people can make to serve their own best interests.<p>Unfortunately, in old-line industries, this idea got flipped and, for years, private choice succumbed to whatever a combination of big government, big corporations, and big unions dictated to the public. Back in the day, writers such as John Kenneth Galbraith even used to celebrate the idea of a &quot;new industrial state&quot; in which the old private competition would yield to ever increasing concentrations of power among government, industry, and labor, who would in turn find ways to &quot;cooperate&quot; with one another in ushering in a more enlightened form of carving up markets and their benefits than mere freedom and competition might provide.<p>Well, the bureaucratic edict in New Jersey is a relic of that old thinking, perhaps perversely and cynically applied to buy off lobbyists and influencers but rationalized nonetheless by the old paternalistic thinking that the consumer is ultimately best served by having his betters making his buying choices for him rather than being allowed to make them for himself.<p>Other than in this cynical sense, there is no possible way in which this outrage can possibly be characterized as &quot;protecting&quot; the consumer.<p>Perhaps the main contribution made by the tech revolution since the 1970s is that it ushered in an era of huge freedom in how people managed their private lives. The internet in particular has been a huge liberating force and so young people especially have come to take it for granted that they can freely make all sorts of choices without having to feel burdened or restricted by the heavy hand of the law. Of course, exceptions can and do remain because abuses can pop up in all sorts of ways without any legal restraints. But, that said, the <i>overwhelming presumption</i> today is that, yes, I can do pretty much what I feel is best for me unless there is a very good reason why I should be restricted from doing so.<p>And that means, if I live in New Jersey, I should be able to find a local Tesla outlet in which I can buy my electric car if I want. The thought that some politician or bureaucrat should be able to dictate serious limits on that choice is repugnant to anyone who thinks that way. And, in my view, rightly so.<p>Unfortunately, where the old political pull persists, the law can be abused to protect old-line market players under some guise or other that is a mere pretext for guarding them from competitors who might offer something better and wind up dislodging them in a free market. Legal regulation is not to be rejected out of hand, of course. Maybe the old-line taxi services ought not to have their business cherry-picked by new market entrants who do things differently. Maybe there ought to be some limits in an urban context on absolute free space-letting if this creates nuisances or the like. The line can sometimes be tricky to draw and can require careful and fair-minded judgments given the interests at stake. But how often do we have situations where nothing of the kind happens and instead the issues are decided, in essence, by who pays off whom and who has what degree of political or bureaucratic pull that can be used to protect systems and structures that are far inferior to what the new competition might offer.<p>I believe that, in these sorts of cases, the tech impetus will ultimately prevail and push things toward broader and freer areas of choice for consumers. Even with this rear-guard action in New Jersey, Teslas can be bought direct from the manufacturer just a short distance away or via remote ordering. And tech-inspired sales and distribution methods in this and a broad swath of other fields will mean that those seeking to limit consumer choice by protecting local turf through bureaucratic pull will be fighting what will ultimately prove to be a losing battle. As consumers, we are not bottled up anymore. If we don&#x27;t like something that is really stupid, we can more and more work around it using other solutions.<p>And so we can, I think, basically see that what the local commission is trying to do in New Jersey is much more a last gasp for the old ways as opposed to being a harbinger that will limit Tesla (or any similar new-wave competitor) from accomplishing its goals. Tesla is right to oppose and fight it (and presents a compelling argument for its view). But the action stands out as so bizarre precisely because it is so out of step with the tech impetus that rules our day. It will stand legally (courts are loathe to intervene in such matters). But the longer-term political winds are against it, in my view, and it will prove a temporary obstacle at most as the modern tech impetus advances.",1394832349

Sorry if this is getting OT...<p>Every FIDO request has an AppID which is the service you are registering for, and it&#x27;s an HTTPS URI.<p>When you resolve (HTTPS GET) the AppID, it returns a list of &quot;FacetIDs&quot; which are basically the different channels/endpoints which you can trust sending an authentication response. No more than one of those channels may be a &#x27;Web Origin&#x27; facet. &quot;In the Web case, the facetID is the Web Origin [RFC6454] of the web page triggering the FIDO operation&quot;. Examples of a non-web facets are &quot;android:apk-key-hash:2jmj...&quot; or &quot;ios:bundle-id:com.acme.app&quot;<p>While processing an authentication request, the FIDO client must;<p>o Obtain FacetID of the requesting Application. Resolve AppID URI and make sure that this FacetID is listed in TrustedApps.<p>-  If FacetID is not in TrustedApps – reject the operation<p>The FIDO client will embed the FacetID it used as part of the signed response it sends back to the server.<p>The authentication response can optionally contain TLS channel binding information, which the server can use to try to detect MITM (although there can be false positives depending on your network). It also looks like a MITM may be able to use a specially crafted certificate to ensure channel binding information is not usable by the FIDO client.<p>The final step on the FIDO client in the spec is simply: &quot;Send [xyz]Response message to FIDO Server&quot;.<p>So in summary, it looks like the response channel can be DYNAMIC -- I can ask your FIDO Client to send an authentication response from a different URL than the one you used when you enrolled, but the domain I ask from has to be listed in the response provided by HTTPS GET of the AppID.<p>The haven&#x27;t found where spec says exactly how the facet ID should be matched up against the string array returned by resolving the AppID. It appears the full path is undefined and left to the control of the attacker. So a FacetID of <a href=""https://www.google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com</a> would allow an authentication response to be sent to <a href=""https://www.google.com/a/domain.com/.."" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/a/domain.com/..</a>.",1394832045

Today,  VC&#x27;s don&#x27;t want to give money to any company that competes with Google.<p>Google has a good product with several competitive advantages.  gmail has great deliverability,  you can easily join mailing lists from gmail which could exclude you if you were hosting from your_name.com.  It handles large mail spools with ease because it uses parallel programming tricks.  Perhaps when you boot it,  it runs a quick Map/Reduce job to build an in-memory index to support all the searching and sorting you do.<p>I quit Thunderbird a few years ago because it just couldn&#x27;t cope.  It would overload,  it would fail and get corrupted and I couldn&#x27;t live with that.  I was using Outlook at work so I switched to Windows Live Mail,  which held up pretty well to the load.<p>With Live Mail I had two problems.  First,  People often couldn&#x27;t read my attachments.  The other was that I felt overwhelmed with the various categories of mail I was getting.  Some of this was spam,  but a lot of it wasn&#x27;t,  such as receipts when I made transactions,  newsletter subscriptions,  etc.<p>That really got me to gmail,  which goes a long ways to relieve that overload.<p>Any product has to make decision about client-server components;  I can read my gmail anywhere,  and that is a big plus.<p>Some people imagine a massed up Outlook or Thunderbird with 64 bit addressing and designed to make the most of multicore processors and large RAM and SSD disks.  The trouble is that most corporations don&#x27;t give out good laptops so you can&#x27;t sell this to large numbers of salespeople unless you bundle it with the hardware.<p>The excitement in the client world is really on the other end,  you could shoehorn it into a tablet and they even have octo-core phones so maybe you can go somewhat far,  but the work is going to all be in super-efficiency and managing differences between tablet platforms.<p>No matter what a big part of the intellectual work is some system that maintains document storage full-text index,  metadata index,  contact book etc.  I&#x27;d like to see this subsystem reusable so that it could be used to handle other sort of document collections.<p>If you move the database away from the client to the server,  you lose many  big differentiations against gmail.  (ex. You can physically destroy your mail spool if it is on your laptop,  who knows who can grab it from the firm you work for.  On the other hand,  industrial spies can grab a laptop from out in front of you,  and if you didn&#x27;t encrypt the volume,  they have your mail spool.)<p>Move the database to the &quot;cloud&quot; and then you are head-to-head with gmail and the advantage they have is a lot more data.  It&#x27;s much easier for them to know what a &quot;discussion group&quot;,  a &quot;promotion&quot;,  or a &quot;update&quot; is than it would be for you to do it.<p>Some kind of CRM functionality could be a big plus.  The idea is to put structure in the communications so that there could be much more automation and also teamwork in that you can hand off the job to someone else and have people held accountable if it doesn&#x27;t happen.<p>I think people hate CRM,  Project Management and those kind of tools worse than they hate e-mail,  so a &quot;business process automation construction set&quot; might be big success if someone can find a way to make it fun.",1394831820

I used to work on Chrome and I was curious what the justification was for storing passwords unencrypted in Chrome. I went and talked to the Chrome security team and they frustratingly explained it to me as they get this question all the time.<p>As you said, in FF, (and in Chrome), a few clicks and anyone could look and an unattended computer and see all the stored passwords. As they pointed out, an unlocked unintended computer can pretty much be owned by anyone who wants to own it. You&#x27;ve given them access to your computer. They can open a shell and start running apps. They can exploit any bug in the OS or other app. They can copy files to a USB stick or across the net. On top of that, your password manager (or FF or Chrome) will let them log into your mail, your bank, your facebook, whatever services you&#x27;ve saved passwords for even without knowing your password.<p>The point is<p>(1) don&#x27;t leave your computer unlocked and unattended. Put a password on it, when you walk away from the computer lock the computer (start the screensaver or whatever that makes it required you to use a password to get back in)<p>(2) don&#x27;t ever let someone use your computer logged in as you. If you hand someone your computer to use login as guest then hand it to them.<p>If you&#x27;re like me you&#x27;ll probably reject these suggestions. I thought &quot;I don&#x27;t want to be bother to lock and unlock my computer all the time&quot; and I thought &quot;It&#x27;s stupid to expect me to put my computer in guest mode anytime I let someone else use it.&quot;<p>But, after I calmed down and thought about it I realized they are right. If someone wants your passwords or other data and you hand them an unlocked machine they are going to get them.  How FF or Chrome or Password managers store passwords has nothing to do with that.",1394831033

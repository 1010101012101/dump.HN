She was put on suicide watch and evaluation, not because it&#x27;s just fun.

If you are OK with 30 confirmations on DOGE, you would be OK with 3 confirmations on BTC.&quot;<p>That&#x27;s not actually true. Satoshi actually provided code in his original paper to calculate this which I&#x27;ve just run, and it turns out that if, say, an attacker controlled 30% of the total mining power of each network during their attack they&#x27;d have a 33% chance of successfully double-spending against BTC with its 3 confirmation requirement and a 0.015% chance of successfully double-spending against DOGE with its 30 confirmation requirement. That&#x27;s a big difference.<p>Let&#x27;s suppose we decided to take advantage of this to require less confirmations on DOGE, say 10. Then the chance of a successful double-spend goes up to 4%, still lower than Bitcoin. Of course, let&#x27;s be generous and assume our attacker now has three times the opportunities to double-spend, upping that to a 12% chance of success. It&#x27;d still be safer to accept transactions with 10 confirmations taking 10 minutes on same-size-DOGE than ones with 3 confirmations taking 30 minutes on BTC.<p>Actually, it looks like if we give our attacker those extra attempts provided by a faster attack for free, 8 one-minute confirmations are at least as secure as 3 ten-minute ones for any size of attacker that BTC can realistically defend against at all. (And remember, we&#x27;re already talking about attackers powerful enough that 3 confirmations in BTC isn&#x27;t safe. If we assume a hacker with 10% of the total mining power, which is arguably all that 3 confirmations can realistically protect against, 5 DOGE confirmations are enough and take half the amount of time as a single BTC confirmation)",1390641503

Quick example. Our CTO was less of a believer in the power of MTurk. We (www.nixty.com) were converting a physics course from MIT. The tests were in PDF form. (a. problems; b. solutions).

This seems associated with the next column over, which is also highlighted (at least, compared to the rest of the column).<p>Next, the top and bottom of columns match up to the next column (or previous column) with the next or previous day/month.  Can you scroll through these? What happens to that relationship then?<p>Where is April 16?  13?  Is there an easy way to tell which column they are in without doing math?  I can see it's 7 days ahead in the second column, but to find a date, I'm still having to scan both columns quickly to try and find the date.  It's in order, but moving from the bottom to the top feels unnatural, and the sizing difference of the rows means I can't just easily/quickly scan.<p>Which column do I go to to find a date?  Let's say I want to find an overview for the week of Aug. 8, the due date of my son.  It seems like selecting a single date requires navigation in all columns, or maybe just a few.  Once you start moving one column, does it affect all? That destroys relationships between columns, and then it feels like you are playing slots.<p>If you do keep the association, you suddenly create a problem where moving one column moves all columns.  If you don't allow changing the columns (it's simply a view), then you can't use it to enter data and in turn reduces it's value.  However, even with just the view, you dedicate 75% of the view to future events, 50% to events more than 7 days ahead.<p>I do like the progression from left to right.

It's true that probably only men are capable of such relationships, though.<p>Yes, I have those shallow friendships too but their purpose is <i>to have fun</i>. We talk about computers, photography, cars, stuff like that, and usually while doing something. However, if those were all I had I would feel <i>really</i> lonely.<p>For me, it's absolutely essential to have few (male) friends who are close and with whom I can talk about and reflect my life. I share things with my wife too but you can't share everything with one close person and you shouldn't. A wife equals not an amateur friend therapist. You might want to mention your fears and problems to her but you don't want to dwell in them with her.<p>I have a feminine side like every person, male or female, and I think it's hugely valuable to have a male guy or two who can respond to that, too. The feminine side is a much smaller part of me than my masculine side but it's still there and if I were to only acknowledge the latter, I would be missing quite a lot in life.<p>Life can rarely be solved, in the masculine problem-solving way; you can only live it. Pretty much all you can ""solve"" in your life is change your attitude, and in order to do that you have to recognize and acknowledge what part of you feels bad. Talking helps in that; in fact, trying to consider it a solvable problem and fix myself would only drive me further from the change I'm eventually going after.<p>But I sure like going karting racing with my friends or having beers and a few good problems to solve: that's fun! I just also acknowledge that it's only one part of me.",1270735744

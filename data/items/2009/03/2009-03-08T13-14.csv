As a user, all I should see is an underlined description of the link.  When I click it, the computer takes me where I need to go.  It doesn't care how long the URL is, because it just doesn't matter that much.<p>I have successfully cut-n-pasted long URLs into IRC, Email, and IM, and it has never not worked.  It may be a bit ugly, but who really cares?",1236520211

507198,comment,506915,507096,0,0,madcaptenor,,,"From what I understand, this sort of thing is common in departments as diverse as English, math, and various foreign languages; the reason is that those departments tend to teach a lot of low-level courses, so they need a lot of TAs.  (I'm a PhD student in a math department, and my department doesn't do what you describe, but some of the departments I considered were like that which is why I didn't ultimately choose them.)",1236520021

Otherwise attackers would would have to use POST, which would mean tricking the user to submit a html form, and I'm unsure if you can send multiple POST requests per submit.",1236518125

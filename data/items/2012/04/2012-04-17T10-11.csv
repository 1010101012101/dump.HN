Not surprisingly, Phonegap never appealed much - same work, inferior results, single (but dubious) benefit: cross platform.<p>I was pleasantly surprised by Titanium mobile though when I had to evaluate it at my job 2 years ago. I set to reimplement one of our (non-trivial) apps and summarize my experience. I ended up writing 50% less code and it took about the same time as what I had spent on the native version. I consider this a compliment though as I was completely new to Titanium. On the flip side I was completely new to the app when I wrote it the first time :-)<p>The build/run/debug loop was unpleasant but I've heard that it has improved since then. As for performance, it was good - Titanium generates native UI, albeit with an interpreter in the middle.<p>I was quite surprised when it turned out that I have a 99% identical app. You see, from the very beginning I decided that I'll be hard on Titanium, my goal was no-compromise, high-fidelity clone. And it worked. The only problem was positioning a tooltip near a touch point - at the time there was no way to traverse the view hierarchy. But then again, maybe I could have implemented it in a different way.<p>I realize a lot has changed since than, but this is my 2 cents - sharing a real world/product experience.",1334660393

3852002,comment,3851515,3851939,2,0,EzGraphs,,,"Yeah, that route could work... but it is a bigger investment in time to learn another language/development environment in greater depth.   At least part of the appeal for PhoneGap and other third party tools is that devs are trying to avoid XCode / Objective C development.  There is something painful/time consuming about the process in comparison to other comparable programming tasks.<p>It seems like there are two ways of approaching GUI/language development:<p>1)  Apples way:  Keep building on a base language (C).  Add new features (Object orientation, XML rather than proprietary configuration, Code Generators).  Maintain backwards compatibility (your old devs will be wowed by each new release's automations and syntax improvements.  New devs that have not been part of your programming tradition will require greater up front study time to grok the process).<p>2)  Microsoft's approach: Make visual development ""primary"" (closer to the way one uses a GUI rather than builds it).  Ignore underlying language constructs and best practices (e.g. make everything global).<p>Having worked with Microsoft, I thought that Apple (especially with their attention to UI design) would give developers a more intuitive interface.  Perhaps it is intuitive to those who can build GUIs in code, but it was not to me.  This is in stark contrast to Microsoft, where someone who knows very little about programming can create a usable GUI (and get themselves in trouble quickly as well).  Don't get me wrong, I am not a Microsoft fan and spend little time in that world.  However, I was able to jump in on several projects and be productive with very little ramp up time.  Apple development required a greater investment of time and energy up front to be productive.  Enough that I have considered PhoneGap and other tools as alternatives for subsequent development.",1334659514

3851986,comment,3851515,3851515,8,0,newhouseb,,,"I spent an inordinate amount of time fighting webkit before switching all of our stuff to native.  The four biggest problems, I think, with the state of webkit are:<p>1) Implicit memory management of large images/surfaces isn't reliable. There's basically nothing you can do (outside of not doing anything) to prevent your page from crashing webkit if you use too many (where too many is undefined) accelerated elements/total texture space. There's no ""Running low on memory"" callbacks or means to explicitly remove a recently drawn image from memory outside of removing it from the DOM and crossing your fingers.<p>2) Lack of proper prioritization in javascript. One of the things that IOS focuses on a lot is separating out user interaction on the main thread from everything else on background threads. In JS, if you're not careful and you do an innerHTML in the wrong spot, you can lock up a bunch of user interaction or delay an AJAX request that would otherwise be executing. Maybe the answer here is something like .updateInnerHTMLWithCallback(function foo(){}) to prevent breakage of JS that does expect the DOM to be consistent after an innerHTML update. (Edit: Oh I forgot, we actually did something similar to this by doing all of our innerHTML updates in setTimeout'ed functions with a 1ms delay).  There's a lot of weird stuff around loading images and keeping UI responsiveness then as well.<p>3) No cache beyond pure source code between separate user sessions. One of the biggest issues for us was initial load time (parsing and calculating CSS, parsing and running JS, and blitting down accelerated DOM elements, etc). Once everything was loaded we could imitate a native-level experience, but this often would be 10-15 seconds in. Perhaps an intermediate cached file (kind of like python's pyc) would help alleviate this.<p>4) Debugging. This was covered, but ugh, what a nightmare. At a certain point I was booting up XCode instruments and tracing through webkit code to figure out what parts of our JS/CSS/etc to optimize.",1334658992

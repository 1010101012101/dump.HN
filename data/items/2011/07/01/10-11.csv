England has effectively got just one centre: London. And living in London is very, very different from living in any other place in England. For one, there are far fewer British people in London. It's a cosmopolitan, international metropolis, with all the benefits that brings.<p>Asking people to move to Newcastle would be a bit like asking people to move to, picking a random one, ""Tulsa, Oklahoma"". Sure, it's a city, and there are people there and all that, but... why the hell would you move your startup there?",1309517915

(I'm the webapp2 author).<p>A big advantage of webapp2 is that you can use existing (and probably future) SDK libraries without adaptation. Many App Engine services (blobstore, mail handler, deferred etc) use handlers made for webapp. With webapp2 you get all those handlers working out of the box with extra benefits: webapp2 is a lot easier to extend and includes the most glaring webapp missing features.<p>Also, you can use all the examples from the App Engine documentation with it, since it is made to be compatible with webapp. And later you learn the new, extended features.",1309517693

They don't risk much cash and they hope that they'll find the next Zuck and make a packet.  Given the strong FS sector in the UK it's not surprising that there's money chasing ideas.<p>If you look at the list of mentors etc. involved in these incubators they tend to be second-rate.  I got invited to be a mentor in one of these programs and the participation required from me was really minimal yet my name would be all over the thing.  I wasn't able to take part because of other commitments, but it strikes me that there's a real quantity over quality problem.<p>My (jaded) view is that it's a version of new adage: ""those that can do, those that can't incubate"".  That may be unfair to these specific folks, but until we see some success from these incubators.  Compare, for example, all the effort in branding/marketing these programs to the effort YC spends on the same.  You do not need a slick web site and list of mentors to make this stuff work.  Hello, you can even use HTML tables for layout and still get people who do cutting edge web work in your program.  What you need are quality principals.<p>I'd be happy to work for a real YC-like in London (actually, it would probably have to be YC itself) because you'd be working in a really small team of really smart people.  Not in some massive team of 'mentors' who aren't providing a great deal of value.",1309515931

The problem with CS is that there's just not enough tutorials/documentation online yet so articles like this are quite welcome. Here's a list of random CS things that took me a little figuring out:<p>1. Every function returns the last operation. To not return anything, insert a blank 'return' at the end.<p>2. Descending ranges just work: [10..0]<p>3. You can use if(`regular JS between backticks`) / else<p>4. You don't need node.js to compile CS (or LessJS)*<p>5. Don't expect a 1-to-1 conversion between old JS and new CS. CS loops have lots of smart-things built-in and will look different but work just the same or better once you know what you're doing.<p>* CS and Less both have JS functions that accept a raw string and output compiled string. On OSX, you can use jsc + little bit of bash to compile CS and Less to JS and CSS respectively.

2717719,comment,2717697,2717697,5,0,fexl,,,"Ah, thanks for posting about my Fexl language.  Although I'm the author of it, and somewhat fond of it, I must emphasize this caveat:  <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2717560"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2717560</a> .<p>Although lazy evaluation is quite amazing, in certain circumstances I find that it's kicking my ass.  For example, consider a function that simply sums the numbers from 1 to N:<p><pre><code>  \sum == (\N\n      long_le N 0\n          0\n          (long_add N (sum (long_sub N 1)))\n  )\n</code></pre>\nOr, more tersely, using the semicolon as a syntactic ""pivot"" to avoid right-nesting:<p><pre><code>    \sum == (\N long_le N 0 0; long_add N; sum; long_sub N 1)\n</code></pre>\nThe problem is that when you call (sum 100000) it builds up a giant chain of (long_add 100000; long_add 99999; long_add 99998; ...) and then evaluates that monstrosity recursively.<p>So I need to do some more work on forcing early evaluation.  You can start by using the standard accumulator trick:<p><pre><code>  \sum == (\total\N\n    long_le N 0\n        total\n        (sum (long_add total N) (long_sub N 1))\n    )\n\n  \sum = (sum 0)\n</code></pre>\nBut even then you still have the massive recursion problem because you're not forcing the addition operation early.<p>I'm thinking I just need to allow basic types like ""long"" to be called as functions with no effect (i.e. equivalent to the identity function, so you can do things like this:<p><pre><code>  \sum == (\total\N\n    long_le N 0\n        total\n        (\n        \total = (long_add total N)\n        total;    # force evaluation; result is I (identity function)\n        sum total (long_sub N 1)\n        )\n    )\n</code></pre>\nHowever, <i>even that</i> doesn't always do the trick, particularly when you're dealing with higher-level values that aren't basic data types.  The problem occurs generally when you build up a big ""chain"" of calculations with arbitrary values, and you have no simple way of forcing evaluation along the way.<p>This is, of course, the classic struggle between eager and lazy evaluation.  But if I don't do the evaluation lazily, I can't define recursion in terms of the closed-form Y combinator, namely (Y F) = (F (Y F)).  Instead I'd have to define it in terms of some kind of run-time ""environment"" using either key-value pairs or the de Bruijn positional technique -- something I've managed to avoid thanks to lazy evaluation in terms of pure combinators.<p>So I must say that although Fexl is an interesting pure-combinator lazy evaluation language, the jury is still out on its practical utility, in my humble opinion.  I've used it in some projects as an embedded interpreter, but the application was quite constricted so you didn't encounter some of these larger issues.<p>That is why I emphasized this caveat earlier today:  <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2717560"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2717560</a> .",1309515513

Initially YC was Boston + Silicon Valley and then became Silicon Valley only.  If you were going to do a non-Silicon Valley YC then you'd need to put it somewhere where there was high connectivity between entrepreneurs, VCs, engineers, etc. etc.  You really need the ecosystem.<p>In Europe there are probably only two places like that: London and Berlin.   And I'd argue that Berlin is far behind London. You could include Tel Aviv as well at a pinch.",1309515027

1891219,comment,1890192,1890192,0,0,azim,,,"I tried breaking this captcha. Here are some experimental results and mathematics:<p>By applying the mathematics from the Birthday Attack (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_attack"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_attack</a>), If an attacker is able to solve 15.8 million of the 180 million captchas, there will be a 50% probability that the attacker can beat the captcha.<p>I tried refreshing the page 10 times, generating a total of 100 captchas. Out of those, I observed 8 arithmetic problems which I entered into and solved using Wolfram Alpha. That gives roughly the 15.8m/180m necessary to break the captcha with 50% probability.<p>At 50% probability, again going back to the Birthday Attack mathematics, an attacker would need roughly 16.8 thousand tries before expecting a collision with one they could break.<p>This probability will increase if an attacker is able to successfully reverse-engineer more patterns.<p>Edit: thinking about this more after MichaelGG's comment, I think my math is incorrect. Either way, point still stands that Wolfram Alpha can successfully solve 8% of the captchas and other patterns should be solvable by other means too.",1289411994

The warden has 100 boxes labeled 1-100, in which he randomly distributes 100 pieces of paper. Each prisoner's name is written on one and only one piece of paper.<p>The warden says to the prisoners: ""You may each open any 50 of these boxes that you choose. If all 100 of you find the box with your name in it, you may all go free. If any of you fail, you will be imprisoned forever."" He tells the prisoners that they may agree on their strategy beforehand, but that he will choose them to enter the room in a random order, and they will not know anything about the previous prisoners' experiences ahead of time. They cannot move the paper around between boxes.<p>What are the best odds the prisoners can give themselves? (Hint: it's better than 1/2^100.)<p>Bonus question: in the limit as the number of prisoners goes to infinity (and correspondingly, the number of boxes), what value do the optimal odds approach?",1289411893

Functions whose arguments are all known can potentially be run once at compile time (partial evaluation). Collections can potentially be handled in parallel if each cell's processing is independent. Etc. This sort of thing is why languages with strong invariants (such as Haskell or Erlang) can do really interesting optimizations.<p>On the other hand, if the language semantics require that everything is polymorphic and has to be looked up at runtime, that adds extra overhead, and it's not always provable what those values will be at compile-time. A JIT-compiler can compile at runtime, when the information is available, but since they're usually not able to pause execution for long, they can't do extensive analysis. JIT compilers can also make optimizations not statically available because they can revert to the non JIT'd code and recompile differently, whereas static compilation is permanent. (Method lookups can also be cached, of course.)<p>Incidentally, normal Lua (i.e., not LuaJIT)'s compiler doesn't do much analysis - it's tuned for vacuuming up huge dumps of structured data, rather than trying to generate optimal bytecode. Lua usually still runs significantly faster than Python or Javascript, but that has more to do with the the clean language semantics and high-quality implementation.<p>Also, a good comment by Mike Pall (the LuaJIT implementer): <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/badl2/luajit_2_beta_3_is_out_support_both_x32_x64/c0lrus0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/badl2/luajit_2_...</a>",1289410139

You may not be the direct source of income, but if they lose all the ""non-customers"" that are using their services, they're going to lose all of their advertisers, which is their direct source of income. The audience is a crucial component in a business model that depends on advertisement.<p>Even if it wasn't, Google opens itself to criticism and review <i>whether their service is free or not</i>. We definitely shouldn't temper our ideas or give Google a pass because ""it's free""; that might excuse some advanced features, but it definitely doesn't extend into basics like contact exporting. That's a fundamental, and something that many have blasted Facebook, also ostensibly a ""free"" service, for not supporting well.<p>Google is making money off of Gmail. If they weren't making money off of Gmail, they would have discontinued the service a long time ago. Even if the nominal costs exceed the direct profits gained from Google Apps licenses and the display of AdWords, etc., which I tend to doubt, the indirect benefits are obviously valuable.<p>Should we all feel a great gratitude to the for-profit corporation Google for pursuing their best interest? Certainly we all appreciate the free services, but Google is no charity and expecting an altruistic, anything-goes attitude to their products is silly. They are a serious company making serious money and competing in a serious space, there's no need to make up excuses for them, especially naive ones like, ""Well it's free anyway so you shouldn't expect anything out of it"".",1289409911

We've only been around for about six months, but we have a really, really good app in the works, and our early preview to a small group of alpha users has gotten rave reviews. However, we're starting to see some issues with one of our founders.<p>This guy (""Jason"") and I have known each other through mutual friends for a few years, and I stupidly decided (rashly) to ask him to do a startup with me for an idea that we came up with together. I thought he was a good developer and would be a good asset; he's worked at some good companies in the past. We needed a third, so we brought on another guy (""Brian"") that we both have known for a few years and trust. We've been working hard on v1 of our first app for the last few months, and we're getting closer to release.<p>But issues with Jason have been starting to surface. For starters, he can't really develop. At least not to the standard that's needed here. We thought we'd put him on other tasks, but he just seems to be slow to catch on with everything. This isn't just me talking; Brian agrees. What's worse is that he seems to be losing steam and doing less and less work. At this point, 95% of all the work other than the initial idea has been done by myself and Brian.<p>Finally, another stupid thing: we haven't setup an LLC or anything yet, and we have no written agreements. We did agree verbally to split the company equally between the three of us, but nothing is in writing or anything yet. I'm not sure I can live with giving away that much equity to someone who isn't pulling hardly any weight, let alone their share.<p>Bottom line: I know I screwed up here by jumping into bed with this guy before doing more due diligence. I feel bad to have dragged Brian into this and I'd really rather not walk away, but I have no idea how to work this out in a way that will work in the long run. And if we can't work it out, I'd rather just walk away than have an issue with this guy who I'll have to work with for years if this thing works out.",1289408831

SQLAlchemy aims to provide an API to represent SQL in Python. Django aims to provide a persistance layer for objects. The difference between these philosophies is important: the use of a relational database is almost an implementation detail for Django, but it's SQLAlchemy's raison d'être.

consider that the Golden Rule requires that if I like a program I must share it with other people who like it.

I cannot in good conscience sign a nondisclosure agreement or a software license agreement.<p>...<p>So that I can continue to use computers without dishonor, I have decided to put together a sufficient body of free software so that I will be able to get along without any software that is not free.
""""""<p>Here RMS explicitly states that using and making software exists in some sort of <i>moral</i> universe where actions have moral implications. A central tenet to RMS's morality is evidently the Golden Rule which he defines as: ""I like a program I must share it with other people who like it."" By sharing RMS means of course sharing the code and all the rights to the code. If software is made, used or distributed in violation of this moral principle it dishonors the program and the user; cursing the software.<p>Thus, according to the GNU Manifesto, Free Software exists to make the fulfillment of our moral obligations possible. At the beginning of the Manifesto RMS says the movement needs money.

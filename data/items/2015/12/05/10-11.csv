I agree with you that online and private don&#x27;t mix. What I was trying to say is that it is like if you don&#x27;t have your space anymore. Unless you turn off your WiFi, put away all your gadgets, there seems to be no space for your thoughts, for you to think by your own about your day-to-day problems and find some interesting conclusions and perhaps to establish a commitment on improving yourself. Wherever you go, sometimes even to the bathroom, people end up taking their phone. When alone in your bed, phone is again present. You&#x27;re always being influenced by what you see, read and perhaps impulsively making decisions based on that without thinking by yourself first.",1449313144

Given the heavy concentration this library seems to place on converting static navigation to dynamic, my surmise is that, instead of responding to a navigation link with an entire HTML document, it just responds with the content that document would contain in the response object&#x27;s &quot;body&quot; member, with content fragments organized by the ID of the element they&#x27;re meant to populate. View changes seem to be supported by sending the appropriate template fragments in the &quot;head&quot;, &quot;title&quot;, and optionally &quot;foot&quot; members of the response JSON object.<p>More complex state transitions such as form submissions appear to be provided for in the second argument of the spf.navigate method, which can take an object including a POST method specification and the corresponding data. It looks like that&#x27;s about all the library provides in terms of request flexibility; per the code, setting custom request headers on navigation requests is definitely unavailable, but it doesn&#x27;t do anything to override the default behavior by which XHR passes on e.g. Authorization headers already set by client code, so (in conjunction with e.g. OAuth) you&#x27;d be able to identify and authenticate the user making the request. I guess the idea is that, for the purpose the library&#x27;s meant to answer, what it provides in the URI is just about all the information the server should need on what content to include in the response.",1449312666

This is especially true in Apple stores where they not only sell devices, but they are also service centers, and hold regular training events on Apple products. These additional functions coupled with offering 5x the number of products from a few years ago, plus the fact that Apple now has an order of magnitude more devices out in customers hands, whom are now coming back to the store to regularly get serviced, and Apple stores are really being stretched to their limits. Employees now need to know how to sell, and service all of these devices. Training staff needs to be able to teach people how to use each device. The logistics teams (each Apple store has it&#x27;s own logistics team), has 25 SKUs to keep track of. Apple retail stores are not the same as your typical Walmart or Best Buy, and they can&#x27;t try to operate like they are.

They do care for their users a lot, but they consider that they would not help them a lot if they did not exist.<p>Given the deep pockets that have risen to develop the Web to new lengths, Mozilla has needed more money and more developers. They are lacking in the chrome (the UI), in tooling, in platform presence (the iOS version came very late!), and little by little, in Web features. Not to mention musts like tab separation into processes, things that are now implemented in every browser but them.<p>(Edit: removed parallelism.)<p>Imagine you saw that issue, and need increased revenues. You don&#x27;t want to impact existing users, as you know they would be mad. What do new users see that old users don&#x27;t? Those empty tiles in about:newtab. Those tiles are useless anyway, and from a UX perspective, new users don&#x27;t understand what they stand for. Having a few example websites would be a good indication. It fits marvellously in the constraints they had.<p>How about Pocket? As we discussed, their chrome is getting old. In particular, the bookmarks feature is both old, has a lot of old bugs that don&#x27;t get fixed, and they have wanted to do an overhaul for a long time (see <a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=697359"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=697359</a>).

Oh, there is: Pocket.<p>One last thing that they can do to increase revenue is to make competition among search engines be felt. So they switched to Yahoo!. However, Yahoo!&#x27;s perspective was to show the world that Yahoo! Search had grown to be much better. Unfortunately, it is still behind as a product in terms of UI cluttering, quality of results, range of inputs... They still don&#x27;t have a cartographic service!

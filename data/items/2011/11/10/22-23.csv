Their value was then, when the company did not have to money to fairly pay their market price, and they had to use promises of future reward to get them to sign on. By all definitions the developers that got them off the ground are now being overcompensated to their market value, but that was the deal right, we can't afford you because you are a good programer and can get 250k in the market, we want to underpay you now with the promise that if we make it you get to participate in the windfall. So it does not matter if they are not contributing now, it was the contribution while they where being underpaid relative to the market that made them entitled to the windfall. It doe not matter if they where a chef or a developer if they agreed to take reduced compensation as a risk, with the promise of participating in the reward and are being deprived of that then they are in a very grey area.",1320965790

The illegal one has a supersede clause in it so that if both are voted in, it undos the other, but since it'll be struck down for being illegal, nothing will actually change.<p>As someone whose state, city and county have implemented direct democracy, I can tell you it sucks.

To me, that kind of behavior always seems very juvenile and ultimately not very fulfilling.<p>I totally get that people are into that, but I really don't see them very happy is what I'm trying to say. The ones that find that sort of behavior to be pure bliss very often turn out to be rather shallow.<p>I also understand that sort of hedonism to be, supposedly, very glamorous - they argue that you only have 80 years, so better squeeze the juice out of every second you get in as self-involved a fashion to satisfy your desires as possible. As long as caring so much about other people is not on your list of priorities, it's very hard for me to make a case against that. I suppose it also comes easy to you when you're very young - the world just automatically cares more about you. What happens after 40 or 50 is a different story. (And yes, I've heard the live-fast-die-young argument where people would rather go down that road and die in their late thirties. Sounds super.)<p>I would rather spend those 80 years as much as possible with people I intensely care about (and who care about me) and while that may be uncommon in your statistics, I think I'm still in my right to argue that it's healthier. And not just because it carries a much smaller risk of contracting various venereal diseases.",1320965614

3222284,comment,3220819,3221094,5,0,absconditus,,,"I worked for a startup during the dot-com boom that seemed to want to be a Yahoo clone. The CEO was incredibly shady and the company was partnered in some way with some huge telemarketing company in Florida.<p>We offered free webmail, just like Yahoo, and at one point the CEO told a developer to add a credit card field to the sign-up form just to see what would happen. Several users entered valid credit card numbers. I do not believe that anything was done with these numbers, but I cannot imagine why the CEO wanted to test this.<p>Our main source of revenue seemed to be banner ads offering shady services from the telemarketing company. One of them was a travel club. The users would be drawn in with an offer of free airline tickets. They had to sign up for the travel club to get the tickets and they had to stay at specific hotels and such that were probably marked up to pay for the tickets. The whole idea was to get them to sign up for the travel club which caused a small monthly fee to be charged to their credit card. They knew how much to charge to get most people not to cancel for months (it was around $8-10). The only ""benefit"" of being in the club was more questionable offers.<p>At one point they considered starting a gasoline club that promised cheaper gasoline. The idea was that people would again pay a monthly fee for the club but then they would have to submit receipts to receive reimbursement for gasoline purchases. They were counting on people being too lazy to submit receipts.",1320965592

3222281,comment,3220854,3222172,1,0,slowpoke,,,"Edit: Woops, this was supposed to be an answer to your parent (zecho), not you.<p>A common definition must not necessarily be a correct definition - ask any scientist, there's probably a number of terms that are misused by the general populace in every field. As a very general example, theory and hypothesis come to mind. When most people say ""theory"", they mean what in a scientific context would be referred to as a hypothesis - an unproven claim that requires verification.<p>Now, we can argue whether or not evolution of language justifies using wrong definitions of a term, but technically, defining ""anarchy"" as ""chaos"" is - in my opinion - not correct. The term denotes a state of society where there is no governing authority, but does <i>not</i> imply the absence of rules, laws or values.<p>The major problem I have with these two definitions is that people who assume the negative one (anarchy == chaos) are, for the most part, not aware of the other meaning, and that quickly leads to confusion - which is sometimes used intentionally to defame opponents in an argument. I personally try to make it clear upfront which definition I am using (anarchy == absence of government or authority), but it's sometimes still hard to escape the negative association of the term.",1320965564

The choice to settle a claim is usually made by the insurance provider, regardless of the wishes of the physician, so a settlement doesn't mean anything per-se: the insurance provider decides whether to settle by weighing a lot of factors, including many that have nothing to do with the actual facts of the case. A court of lawparticularly in a jury trialmay not be the fairest way to adjudicate these issues, but the AMA routinely attempts to block any other proposals for holding doctors accountable (see the story: they supported the removal of the database as well) so malpractice suits and the occasional newspaper story are what we're left with in policing these docs.",1320965277

3222227,comment,3220242,3221967,1,0,cop359,,,"(sry posting from a different account, but same person)<p>I think your views of Chinese culture is being colored by a skin deep look at China's past hundred years. I think as a a whole Chinese history would disagree with you. During times of dynastic change Taoism was <i>the</i> prevailing cultural trope. Because dynastic change isn't the majority of historical time it can give the impression that Confucianism is the dominant ""religion"", but these moments of turmoil are critical and their effects are long lasting. Taoism (or at least their way of looking at things) is always in the background.<p>Just as an example, look at the literati culture after the take over of the Yuan Dynasty. Southern Song loyalists persisted for about two generations and really revitalized Taoist-inspired world views. They were the driving engine of Chinese culture during that time. Things like romanticizing the farmer, living of the land, the life of recluses etc.<p>A very similar thing happened after the take over of the Qing dynasty. Ming loyalists revitalized many of the same ideas.<p>During more tumultuous times Chinese turn to the more individualistic, less paternalistic side of their Culture as the central authority (and everything it represents - a father figure, the cultural vanguard etc.) erodes.<p>Right now, with the influx of Western ideas/culture and lifestyle the authority of the Communist regime is eroding to an extent. People view it as corrupt, inept and it doesn't command the respect it once had.<p>I think there is a cultural ""swing"" that is going to happen. And my argument was that neither system is conducive to entrepreneurship<p>""Assigning the idea of e.g. fatalism to ""mostly Taoism"" is also inaccurate.""\nit's obviously an over simplification on my part. It's a complicated multifaceted world view of course, but fatalism plays an important part from what I understand.\nIt's a little unfortunate that you didn't elaborate because I'd love to know your view of Taoism. I'm by no means an expert (haven't read any Taoist literature for instance), but from what I know it isn't the belief system of the capitalist-entrepreneur.<p>___\nExample of Taoist influence:\nI've mostly approached Chinese culture from the artistic perspective, but look at for example Bada Shanren (Ming Loyalist), vs. like<p><a href=""http://images.search.yahoo.com/search/images;_ylt=A0oGdVGUT7xOFCoAN25XNyoA?p=Bada%20Shanren&fr2=piv-web"" rel=""nofollow"">http://images.search.yahoo.com/search/images;_ylt=A0oGdVGUT7...</a>\n<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shen_Zhou"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shen_Zhou</a><p>Even without knowing a lot of abotu Chinese art, you can see that Shen Zhou has a more traditional Confusian take on art (he's imitating the masters. That's why his work looks more ""generic"") while Bada is a lot more experimental and lets his individuality come through his art (Shen does too, but in more subtler ways that aren't very easy to explain).",1320964973

Based on what I've learned here, it seems to me it would be a good idea to put up a landing page of some sorts and maybe drive traffic to it with an Adwords campaign but what sort of conversion would you guys use to proxy for a sale given that I can't actually sell the product without having produced it (or even having invested in the branding yet)?  I supposed I could have people sign-up for a newsletter or something but I would really have no clue how that conversion rate might convert to a sales conversion rate.

Their orbiters sent back around 60 images though, so they can be considered marginal successes. Mars 4 failed to achieve orbit, but somehow gets counted as a success by people who tally these things because they still managed to do at least some science as it zipped by. Mars 6 ceased transmission after 224 seconds, and what data it did send was near-useless due to degradation in the electronics. The last ""successful"" mission sent by the Soviets was Phobos 2 in 1988. It got some great data on the way in, but contact was lost as it approached it's ultimate target, Phobos.<p>Mars 5 was the <i>only</i> hands-down, unqualified success of the entire program.<p>(The only post-Soviet Russian mission to Mars, Mars 96, is counted among the 14 failures).<p>14 failures, 5 marginal ""successes"", and only 1 mission that achieved its objectives completely.<p>I hope the people down-voting me didn't think I was being prejudiced or something. It's just the simple truth: with the Soviet/Russian Mars program, failure is the expected outcome.<p>If Phobos-Grunt is lost, I would be greatly saddened, but hardly surprised.",1320962763

3222093,comment,3221671,3221671,3,0,sanderson1,,,"A can see both sides of this story. I do want to make one thing clear. I think any public information is just thatpublic. There shouldn't be restrictions on how it is used other than in purposely misleading ways, which is probably how this doctor viewed the release of the information related to his medical background. I think the reporter was completely justified in what he did. I don't believe he was on some kind of witch hunt, out to destroy this doctor's career. From the sounds of it, he's doing a pretty good job of that himself.<p>On the flip-side, just because a doctor is sued for malpractice doesn't mean he's guilty of malpractice. I'm not familiar with the database, but if it doesn't list the outcomes of malpractice suits, it should. Simply saying a doctor has been sued 16 time for malpractice doesn't tell the full story. But in this case, him settling almost half of those cases, in my mind, does admit some level of guilt.<p>Do I think the doctor is right in wanted the use of this information restricted? No. Do I think he deserved discipline from the Medical Board? Probably. Do I see how inaccurately presenting information can hurt innocent people? Absolutely.<p>I'll go back to what I started with. Public is public. Just tell the full story. (which, by the way, I think was done fairly well in the article)",1320962436

There are rare exceptions, but the odds are so bad that I would not take the chance or extend the trust.<p>There aren't enough specifics in your write up to know for sure what to do. However, either you hold equity or you do not and that should be a major factor.<p>If you are an equity holder in this company and it is a funding issue, not a core business issue, I would stay and see it through. Sometimes you can cut way back on the leverage and nurture the core profit with the equity holders you have.<p>If you are an employee, exit as diplomatically and respectfully as you can. Why? You made an agreement with your company to trade services for pay. They have defaulted. It sounds like they have done so without a heads up. This shows a lack of integrity on the part of management and is even more troubling than the cash.<p>There are things in the world that can blind side a good management team - abrupt law changes, competitor introduces game changing technology, key team member leaving, etc. However, pay roll is a cash flow issue and one management teams can look ahead and predict.<p>If a management team can't predict, process and pay payroll, how well can they execute on the things that make your business money?<p>If they can execute on payroll but have chosen not to, or to not tell you, are they people that you should throw your lot in with?",1248807530

Consequently, there's always another goalpost that science didn't hit (<i>no, wait, it's only 64-bit WEP encryption!</i>)... but it's not logical to thus conclude that the problem is the science.

I concur with most of it.<p>Let me add something from another perspective:<p>Speaking as a startup owner who has had money problems from time to time:<p>a) crap happens<p>b) your hourly people, who have no equity, deserve every single cent.  Whether answering phones, stuffing boxes, or whatever, these people work hard, and you MUST pay them every penny, on the day it's due.<p>c) Folks who have equity, and will see some upside in good times, can be asked (ASKED, not TOLD) if they are willing to make sacrifices for the success of the team.  Ask them ahead of time - preferably well ahead of time.<p>d) When a startup has successes, it's because of your people.  When a startup has problems, it's because of leadership.  Get out your spoon and start eating shit ^H^H^H humble pie.  Tell your people that screw ups happened, and - because the buck stops with you - YOU are the cause.  Apologize to your people.<p>e) LEADERS LEAD FROM THE FRONT.<p>The last point is the most important.  Before an owner asks anyone to take even a temporary pay cut, he should cut his own pay to the bone.  Before he misses a payroll for other people, he should have already skipped a paycheck or two.<p>Startups come and go, but 50 years from now, your reputation, and your sense of self will still be with you.  Make sure that you are scrupulously ethical with your people.<p>Travis J I Corcoran, President\nSmartFlix",1248804218

I could disprove cat allergies easily using the same method, provided the exposure time was less than the time needed for symptoms to set in.",1248804002

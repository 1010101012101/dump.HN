Buy or build?",,"Hypothethical situation: I have a webapp that I want to deploy on a paid subscriptions basis. I would like the sign-up, billing, and provisioning process to be as simple as possible for the user (ie. just a few clicks).<p>A complicating factor is that the app requires each user to have their own instance of the app. It's not a simple case of 1 user == 1 account, more like 1 user == 1 deployment. You could argue that's not a web app, but for the purposes of this thread, please let's pretend it is :)<p>I would like opinions on setting up the infrastructure to do this, particularly billing & invoice management, and automated provisioning. Support tickets would be desirable, but not essential.<p>I know I can always build this myself, but if there is something out there I can use (ie. open source) or buy, then it would be faster to get to market.<p>Any thoughts on build vs buy?<p>If buy, any thoughts on what to consider to buy?<p>I've looked at things like ModernBill and WHMCS, but these are more for web hosting. I don't want stuff like DNS management, email configuration, blah blah.

And you really don't have to use exotic commands to run into compatibility issues between bsd and linux. It's not long ago I had an error reported due to the fact that readlink doesn't work equal on linux and bsd. I don't think readlink is in the ""too complicated"" basket.<p>> That's the other broken premise. You don't ""build once, run anywhere"".<p>Why would I prefer to write three different deployment scripts, if I could write one? Am I missing something here?<p>> Puppet shows the way.<p>I don't know Puppet. I'll have a look at it.",1247158790

696245,comment,694117,695602,0,0,delano,,,"I think we mostly agree, we're just looking at the problem from different directions.<p><i>Of course it does.</i><p>Can apt launch EC2 instances and execute scripts (that are not part of the package) before and after installation? Can it update security group settings and request and assign static IP addresses? My understanding is that apt does not help with these problems, so we write scripts or use tools like Fabric to do this. These scripts/tools are aware of the package manager in that they call the commands to make things happen. This is the level I'm talking about at which there are open problems.<p><i>If you mix linux distributions in a production environment then you have bigger problems to resolve first.</i><p>In an ideal world this is true, but it does happen. For example, one vendor my require a specific type or version of OS from the rest. A business may also choose to change the OS from one release to the next.<p>It's important to be aware of what is possible and account for it ahead of time. Again, I'm not advocating <i>not</i> to use apt or yum or rpm. I'm suggesting that it's helpful to not tie your process to a specific one unless you have complete control over the environment, now and for the foreseeable future.",1247158713

It is a broad topic and much can be said on this, but the short version is: it is always advisable to develop looking at more standards compliant browsers and then tweak it to work in IE. Usually it will take less effort.<p>The reason for this is that IE let's you deviate more from standards, and then fixing it for other browsers will take more time. Also, other browsers albeit having own quirks are much more consistent – that means that if it works in Safari it is most likely to work in Firefox and Opera too.<p>Of course IE does not support a lot of things other browsers do. Maybe it is time to weight you options there: are you sure you want site to look the same across all the browsers and is it worth the effort? Or can you live with simpler version for IE but gaining advantage of having to write and maintain less code?<p>Highly recommended site ;) : <a href=""http://dowebsitesneedtolookexactlythesameineverybrowser.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dowebsitesneedtolookexactlythesameineverybrowser.com/</a>",1247158680

Security researchers are unnaturally attractive to trade reporters, and there's business value in cultivating contacts with them, and I've definitely let that process run too far in the past.<p>So, a mistake is a mistake. And thus, regarding your first graf, two responses:<p>(1) I stand by my original argument that Schneier doesn't appear to be close enough to Chrome OS security to comment on it, and his comments appear to misconstrue what Chrome OS is aiming for, <i>and</i><p>(2) I stand by my original argument that this is an example of Schneier's business objective of inserting himself into every conversation about computer security again coming at a cost of his credibility.<p>Finally, you want to understand my need to pull Schneier down. I don't care if he's smart. I care that he's a guru. He's listened to uncritically by lay professionals, and his opinions about the problems they face are often not valuable. I'll add that Schneier's reputation in cryptography --- a field I am not a part of --- is not ironclad. If you want to stick up for a scientist, start with their citation record.

Was this all just a bunch of BS?  I know there are some really really fantastic coders that hang out here, do any of you guys actively use psychadelic drugs?<p>As somebody that tries to stay away from any sort of drug (except alcohol.  I have a weak spot for beer) as much as possible (including over-the-counter things etc.), has using these things benefited you in any way?<p>The way that I have heard LSD etc. users describe its affects, it sounds like it would be anything BUT beneficial.",1247155545

And as much as I might hate to admit it, the CUA-like cut/copy/paste bindings probably make more sense than the default for anyone but a hardened emacs veteran.<p>Other stuff seems borderline insane.  Like this design principle:<p><i>cursor moving commands are placed all for the right hand, while text changing commands are all placed for the left hand. (similar to Dvorak having all vowels in one side)</i><p>Dvorak does that because vowels are usually typed alone in a word, so the natural typing pattern is an alternation between hands, minimizing the chance that a single finger might have to type two keys in succession, or a hand might be left in a poor position for the new key.  That's completely wrong for this situation!  A motion key is likely to be followed by more motion, while if you're modifying text, you're likely to continue modifying text.<p>Or this one:<p><i>Alt is considered better than Ctrl. (Alt is a natural thumb curl, Ctrl is stretched pinky.</i><p>This might be true on some keyboards.  It certainly isn't on typical laptops, where Alt almost <i>never</i> lives in a consistent position across hardware.  Relying on keys without fixed positions is just bizarre, and in direct contradiction to ""ergonomics"" to my mind. What's worse, this completely ignores the pervasive practice among emacs users of mapping Ctrl to CapsLock, a key which is extremely easy to type <i>and</i> in the same location on all keyboards.<p>On the whole, I just can't see these bindings actually helping me that much, sorry.  It's a good try, and I'm sure the author gets good use out of them.  But to my fingers, they introduce as many problems as they solve.",1247155506

What programmer hasn't been told to do code right the first time so it's easier to maintain?  And since she didn't provide any suggestions on how to get CTO's to do this or how to justify the initial expense to management the whole article comes across as just a rant.",1247155304

I read the postmortem written by the Sunlight Foundation guys; while they were well-meaning and I don't want to knock their effort, <i>they didn't stand a chance</i>.<p>Getting Federal work isn't anything like working in the private sector.  There's all the paperwork to go through, putting together a proposal and writing all the contracts (which is a huge amount of work and is basically done at-risk), and that's just to avoid getting your proposal thrown out.  To actually win, you need connections.<p>A ""good"" government contracting officer can basically use the FAR to their agency's benefit, and in effect steer the contract to whomever they want to win.  If you're not that person, you're done for.  I'm not even implying anything illegal, just that the FAR is so complicated and has so much room for subjective judgment, it's pretty much guaranteed in my experience that contracts will be awarded to whomever the agency feels most comfortable working with.<p>It is not a system that is kind to outsiders.  If you don't have a staff full of proposal writers and lots of experienced people with personal networks to draw on and extensive resumes, your best -- and IMO only -- bet is to cozy up to one of the big players and work as a subcontractor for a while.",1247155281

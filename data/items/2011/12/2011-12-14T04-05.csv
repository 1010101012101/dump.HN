Panic and recover are not an exception mechanism as usually defined because the usual approach, which ties exceptions to a control structure, encourages fine-grained exception handling that makes code unreadable in practice.  There really is a difference between an error and what we call a panic, and we want that difference to matter.  Consider Java, in which opening a file can throw an exception.  In my experience few things are less exceptional than failing to open a file, and requiring me to write inside-out code to handle such a quotidian operation feels like a Procrustean imposition.<p>Our proposal instead ties the handling to a function - a dying function - and thereby, deliberately, makes it harder to use.  We want you think of panics as, well, panics! They are rare events that very few functions should ever need to think about. If you want to protect your code, one or two recover calls should do it for the whole program.  If you're already worrying about discriminating different kinds of panics, you've lost sight of the ball.""",1323838576

3350668,comment,3347841,3350087,2,0,jcr,,,"> (though I'd love to be proven wrong)<p>one-up-manship sucks, but correct information is beneficial. ;)<p>The problem with the term ""NAT"" as ""Network Address Translation"" is the
term is often misused/incorrect; most all modern ""NAT"" implementations
are actually ""PNAT"" (""Port and Network Address Translation"") where the
translator system modifies both the source address and source port
rather than just modifying the source address.<p>For notes, the earliest translation implementations really were just
address modification, and hence, really were plain ""NAT,"" but the
problem of conflicting port numbers is the reason why just about every
implementation moved to PNAT.<p>When running a PNAT implementation, you can exhaust the number of
available TCP ports with enough load from client systems. The number of
available TCP ports is typically, but incorrectly, stated as 2^16 ports,
but in practice, you can't use all of them.<p>Getting around the TCP port count limitation is entirely possible, and
regularly done in large scale networks. The early implementations were
standard ""proxy systems/servers"" (typically requiring client-side
configuration like, address, port, user/pass, etc.). More modern
implementations are ""transparent proxies"" and require no client-side
configuration. Transparent proxy implementations (typically) count on
PNAT in order to be ""transparent"" to the client systems and prevent the
need for client-side configuration.<p>The mental leap one needs to make in order to understand how to get past
the TCP port count limitation is, understanding that a single public IP
address can be shared by multiple systems simultaneously without
NAT/PNAT or proxies. There are many ways to do it from ""load balancing
appliances,"" to CARP (Common Address Resolution Protocol - free in
OpenBSD), to VRRP (Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol - patented by
Cisco), to other methods. This is often combined with multiple stateful
firewalls where all of the firewalls share their state tables.<p>Similarly, pools of public IP addresses can also be shared amongst
multiple systems simultaneously. Let's say your shared state table
already has an entry with your source of ""aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd port 1331"",
with a pool of address, you now have your choice of changing either the
port number or the source address. --This isn't particularly precise,
but it is a good way to reason through it.<p>AOL used to (and maybe still does?) run some humongous transparent
proxies. If you search around, you'll find some (historic?) complaints
from sites about not being able to block trolls or malicious traffic
from jerks on AOL without blocking everyone on AOL. The only IP the site
owners got was the from the small block dedicated to the AOL transparent
proxies. I <i>think</i> this issue may have been resolved by the ""proxy-for""
header being added eventually (i.e. often called a ""non-anonymous
proxy""), but my recollection is a bit fuzzy.<p>The point to take away from this is, AOL, at its height, was able to
stuff all of it's millions of users behind a couple dozen proxies/IP's,
so the number of TCP ports is only a limitation in theory, but it's not
a limitation in practice.<p>Yogi Beara once said, ""In theory, practice and theory are the same, but
in practice, they're not.""",1323838476

3350666,comment,3348671,3348671,60,0,sophacles,,,"So heres my experience with this whole topic:<p>When I was very young, I remember feeling trapped in life. It wasn't a particularly terrible life, but not a particularly great one either. There were times when I just didn't want it. As I got older, I spent a lot of time mildly depressed. There were expectations I couldn't live up to, it seemed my family wanted me to be perfect, and the repercussions for not being so were pretty emotionally damaging. Somehow I internalized this expectation, and it only worsened all of it. There were a lot of things that I didn't know how to do well: make close friends, talk to girls, ask for help. A lot of this was probably BS at first, and in retrospect everyone went through it. I know that for me there was a weird feedback loop tho, reinforced by craziness in my family, where they would push away my friends, and would ridicule me for needing help.<p>Anyway, all that led to this scenario where I felt even more alone an trapped. As others were working through this stuff, I couldn't figure out how to even start going with it. I wasn't a ""forever alone"" kind of guy, I stuttered through this stuff, but not in a particularly meaningful way. Not existing sounded amazing. I contemplated it off and on. At one point I had a serious sit-down with myself about the topic of suicide. I went over the pros, the cons, ways to do it, the consequences to others and so on. I decided, this was an option. I also realized, I only get to choose it once.<p>I found this realization very comforting.<p>Ever since, I have been slightly annoyed at the ""suicide is not the answer"" stuff I read. I get pissed at the people who deride it. I hate the people who talk about it as not an option. It is an option, but a pretty drastic one. (Raganwald: I like your stuff usually, but your blog post kind of annoyed me, even tho it's not terrible advice... it just doesn't work for me - nothing personal)<p>Since this realization, I have gone through some pretty down times. As I mention above, I'm a bit socially/emotionally challenged, and sometimes I just feel like I'm getting nowhere in the world of people. I see them over there doing their thing, and I just don't understand how it works. I occasionally even see them not as people, but the same way I would see a group of dogs or other animals interacting -- I notice their behaviours, I try to figure out WTF it is all about, but I just can't relate. This really bothers me when it happens. Other times I get really down over messing up with people, or not being a top 50 programmer, or not being 4 hr marathoner, or whatever else my perfectionism is going on about. In all these cases, if it's bad enough, I get this thought:<p>""You can just give up. You can stop existing.""<p>I don't shy away from it, I don't push it down, that seems to make it worse. I'm not scared of it, I welcome it. Like I said above, it is a comforting thought to me. It reminds me I have some power in the world, no matter how fucked up things are at the moment. Afterwards, the next thought comes:<p>""You only get to do this once. Is this the time?""<p>And I get to decide if it makes sense. And I only need to decide for today. Do I want to do this today? Sure things are fucked up, but I sure would exit in a pretty shitty situation: things undone, house a mess, porn not properly deleted from the computer, finances not in order, etc. So I won't do it today. Maybe I'll start getting ready to do it. Tomorrow I can decide again.<p>Sometimes this goes on for a day. Sometimes it goes on for a week. But the very act of contemplating it seems to have a healing power for me. Now that I know I can at least do this, and I'm going to do it right, it reminds me that I can maybe do stuff. Getting ready for it, reminds me more that maybe I'm not so trapped, and there is a path forward, paradoxically getting me to the point where I usually put aside the silliness after a while, with a freshly organized set of life surroundings. Sometimes it's more than a while, but for me, this works.<p>I'm putting this out here, for the people who are contemplating suicide, and somehow reading these comments. Contemplate away, I won't begrudge you that. I'd like to remind you that this is a one-time deal tho, so if you're going to do it, make sure this is the right answer for you. If you are unsure, wait a while, see what else you can do also - the option doesn't go away, in fact this basic option is the greatest power you have, don't squander it.<p>Also: after this article leaves the front page, I'm going to delete this post, because while I think it is important, I don't know that having these words public for posterity is a wise decision.",1323838458

-They had no idea what people would use these things for
-Designed for 6 months and finally built their first computer
-All their friends wanted one, but it took 40 hours to build and debug a single machine
-They spent all their spare time helping their friends build computers
-So they decided to print circuit boards and sell them, to cut down assembly to 5-10 hours
-They scrounged up $1300 to have a circuit board laid out
-One day, when Jobs was out selling circuit boards, he met someone who wanted to buy 50, but insisted that the machines be fully assembled
-And so on...<p>Quite a different story than the usual version, which portrays Jobs as a natural genius of knowing exactly what people want before they knew themselves.",1323837682

""plate"" is a STRING, one of the key names in the dishes object.<p>See, here is the compiled code fresh from the compiler (with added comments):<p><pre><code>    var plate;

    if (meal.status === 'done') {
        for (plate in dishes) {

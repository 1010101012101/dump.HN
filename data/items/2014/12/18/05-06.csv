It&#x27;s one thing to compromise servers from anywhere in the world and it&#x27;s quite another to build bombs and plant them in movie theaters.

8766156,comment,8765714,8766097,0,0,derefr,,,"What do you expect to happen, then, in cases where you have a &quot;can&#x27;t fail&quot; transparent deserialization operation from a wire format that doesn&#x27;t limit the precision of its integers? Say, a web request that receives and decodes a JSON object. Now, JSON itself has no integer type, just a double type—but when people are manually generating JSON, they tend to forget this and shove arbitrary-precision integers in as naked \d+ tokens; and when people are receiving JSON, they also tend to expect to receive integers, not doubles. So what would you expect this JSON-decoding library to do, in a sensible language:<p>• crash the request thread?<p>• output a floating-point value with some of the precision thrown away?<p>• output a machine integer with the overflow flag set?<p>• output an arbitrary-precision integer?<p>Basically, arbitrary-precision integers are a necessary part of any platform that needs to be able to hold onto, and do math to, externally-generated numbers that didn&#x27;t arrive packed in #1A type structs.<p>To insist, in the modern day, on attempting to do <i>arbitrary math with arbitrary numbers</i> using strictly machine words, is like insisting on defining a Postgres column as a VARCHAR, when TEXT is just as optimal for the average case, while automatically coping with edge-cases.<p>Most numbers computers touch don&#x27;t have bit patterns that fit in 8(2^n) bits, but not 8(2^n) - 1 bits.

8766152,comment,8765870,8766069,0,0,michaelkeenan,,,"I tried to roughly estimate the risk.<p>There are 18,000 theaters that could be targets. Let&#x27;s say there are 10 showings over the opening weekend that might be bombed, so if you attend, there&#x27;s a 1 in 180,000 chance you&#x27;ll be in the bombed theater (assuming there&#x27;s only one bombing). Let&#x27;s say there&#x27;s a 5% chance it&#x27;s a real threat (personally I&#x27;d estimate around 1%, but let&#x27;s use 5% to be conservative). That gives a 1 in 3.6 million chance of being in the bombed theater.<p>Compare to car accidents. There are 1.27 fatalities per 100 million miles traveled in the USA. If the movie theater is five miles away, that gives you a 1 in 7.9 million chance of dying in a car accident on the way to or from the movie.<p>If we stop calculating there, it looks like you&#x27;d be roughly twice as likely to be in the bombed theater than to die in a car accident on the way to the theater. (Note that this is the chance of <i>being in the bombed theater</i>, not of <i>dying in the bombing</i>. Presumably, most people in the theater would survive.) To me, that seems like an acceptably negligible risk.<p>More detailed calculations could include the chance of dying conditional on being in the bombed theater, and could include the chance of more than one theater being bombed, and adjust for the chance of the bomber being foiled or the bomb not working, and could adjust for which theater you&#x27;re seeing it in (theaters in major cities are more likely targets than small towns).",1418881689

Similar to the &#x27;overflow&#x27; flag the processor automatically sets to signal signed overflow, the processor flag for &#x27;carry&#x27; is already being set by the processor when you add or subtract unsigned numbers that overflow.  There is no separate signed or unsigned addition in x86/x64 assembly --- the processor just sets the flags for both cases, and they can either be used or ignored.<p>This is the reason that overflow checking can be so inexpensive --- no additional checking is necessary, just a conditional branch on an existing flag.  Correctly predicted branches not taken are very inexpensive, and this branch will almost always be correctly predicted.  The issue is that standard C doesn&#x27;t allow any direct defined way to make use of the overflow flag.

Sony is a giant conglomerate with 140,000 employees and who knows how many child companies. To top it off, Sony BMG was a 50/50 joint venture with Bertlesmann.

Nevertheless, I did a double take at &quot;more emphasized in the latter&quot;, and perhaps there is an advantage to looking at the short term.  In that time span, in terms of big mainstream issues, on Democrats&#x27; side in favor of <i>less</i> government control of social norms (for its own sake rather than to effect another policy), we have:<p>- gay marriage legalization - not that the ideology has had much to do with the role of government, but treating would-be spouses equally gets the government out of the picture<p>- abortion - quite explicitly with &quot;women&#x27;s bodies&quot; rhetoric<p>- stem cell research<p>- marijuana legalization<p>- immigration, sort of, in the sense that acceptance of illegal immigrants is a social issue in addition to an issue of laws<p>- euthanasia (not a big issue)<p>On the Republicans&#x27; side we have:<p>- opposition to affirmative action<p>- opposition to education centralization - but No Child Left Behind was signed by Bush<p>- gun rights - gun violence, obviously, directly hurts other people, in contrast to most of the issues on the other side, but the proper role of guns also a social issue<p>Maybe I just have a bad memory, but the first list has a lot more in the way of hot-button and clear-cut issues than the second.",1418879571

The difference is the key to a lycra that feels luxurious to one that doesn&#x27;t.<p>Some tech facts:<p>Graphics are printed onto stretch fabrics using a process called sublimation printing. The ink based graphics are printed onto a paper, from which they are heat pressed onto the fabric to allow the colors to adhere to the individual fibres within the fabric. This process is only possible with polyester based fabric. Nylon fabrics simply melt when subjected to heat from the sublimation printing process. However, we didn’t want to compromise on our design principle for The Bib and stuck with a nylon based fabric to achieve the superior comfort unattainable when using printable lycra.<p>Nylon too is a less complex molecule (without the dreaded Benzene ring that&#x27;s in Polyester). This means that from a chemistry standpoint, its a less rigid polymer, achieving that soft and compliant feel.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t say why you should choose us over one of the big brands. That&#x27;s a personal choice after all! But, i will say that we are a super niche company that&#x27;s thrown 6 months of time into making a product that works on your 6 hour ride.<p>Do follow us on Instagram (redwhite_apparel) and see what we do there :)",1418879490

For a not contrived example, I don&#x27;t want weird stuff to happen when my semaphore counter overflows, or underflows, I want it to just crash, right there.  (My perspective and desires come from a project where I didn&#x27;t care about &quot;raw&quot; performance that much -- the project being a storage engine where C++ was chosen with the performance concerns in mind being lack of GC and resultant traffic shockwaves, so my preferences lie a bit away from CPU integer operation performance and more towards crashing obviously at the spot of the foul.

Maybe there are reasons why that's the wrong approach, but I tend to regard interaction and packaging as two very distinct design components. If the packaging is the problem, fix that first.<p>Changing the interaction should come second. <i>Dumbing</i> <i>it</i> <i>down</i> is almost never the solution, yet it's often the first solution people turn to when trying to deal with a gender gap. It's as if they think the issues will go away if they speak very slowly and loudly.<p>(I admire the objective, but I believe I would like the project better if it said ""an engineering toy"" instead of ""the engineering toy."" The implication differs.)",1348192798
4551833,comment,4535611,4536231,1,0,HorizonXP,,,"So I presented the sapphire option to my girlfriend. She was hesitant at first because she wasn't sure what it would look like on her hand. After scouring Toronto, I found the Fair Trade Jewellery Co. (<a href=""http://ftjco.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ftjco.com/</a>). I'm linking to them because they are fantastic.<p>They stayed open past their normal hours so that my girlfriend and I could make it down. They sourced 3 purple sapphires for us so she could see, and 1 of which was absolutely gorgeous. My girlfriend loved it, and it's what I ended up going with. Putting a payment down next week.<p>But the best part appeals to the nerd and engineer in me. They do bespoke rings, fully in-house. They will customize the ring to any design you want, to fit your finger and the gem. That way, it's not only designed the way you want, it's made to uniquely fit you.<p>They design everything in CAD, and iterate with you via e-mail. Then they print it on their 3D printer, where you have a chance to go in, see it in person on your finger and with the gem. If changes are needed, they can iterate again. Otherwise, they go ahead and make a plaster mold. Then they melt the metal (i.e. gold, platinum) and cast it. They have all the equipment for this in-house in the back of their store. Honestly, I haven't been more excited about buying a ring than now. I'm super happy I found them.",1348192791

The network--be it provided by a laptop hotspot or a router with custom software--is programmed to intercept request/response cycles as follows.<p>Every response, except those that are part of Malorie's attack, is replaced with a redirect to Pandora's settings page. Some fraction of users will have a Pandora login cookie, which means they'll see the page.<p>Further, every response for the Pandora settings page gets a <script> tag of Malorie's creation. The JS reads the value attributes of the password and email fields and sends them to Malorie's server.<p>Malorie then has a bunch of email/password combos.

Invalid TLS certs will at least give a browser warning that a user isn't used to seeing (in modern browsers), cluing them in that something might be up. Sure, some users might bypass it anyway, but there's at least some tip-off. Furthermore, there's no reason why the password needs to be in the DOM past the login page, which can easily be served over full HTTPS with no user experience impact. Yes, that can still fall prey to session hijacking if you don't use HTTPS for the rest of the site, but session hijacking doesn't give you passwords that you can use to go break into other sites.",1348192511

This is a basic principle of security for anything other than MAC style security systems (and even then...)<p>2) I think there <i>is</i> a very real risk there, but of course, unless they use HSTS (and therefore always HTTPS) everywhere, there is a risk of this. Even if they use HSTS (which isn't broadly supported in browsers yet), almost no-one checks TLS certificates for man-in-the-middle attacks. In short: the man-in-the-middle attack risk is always a risk unless the user takes extraordinary efforts. They could do more to mitigate it, but it'd undoubtedly have some seriously negative user experience consequences. It seems like a very high bar to hold Pandora to given the nature of their service.

This scenario probably requires a united government</i><p>The last time it happened in 1986, the House was Democratic and the Ways And Means Committee was run by famously corrupt but effective old-time Chicago pol Dan Rostenkowski. The Senate was Republican and liberal West Coast Oregon Republican Bob Packwood was running the Senate Finance Committee.  President Ronald Reagan and his tax policy chief Donald Regan were more right wing than the Koch brothers and Michelle Bachmann combined.<p>Together they pushed through the biggest tax reform in the nation's history.[0]<p>There was nothing united about US government in 1986. It's hard to imagine a political spectrum as disunited and full of genuine differences today. Nevertheless, Reagan bet his second term policy agenda on tax reform and Rostenkowski arranged an unprecedented public media campaign and put himself on television selling the Reagan idea to the people and his own party. The reform was pushed through with bipartisan support and only oil companies and employee benefits escaped unscathed. All the other pressure groups had to give for the national good.<p>The difference is not a united government. We had united government in 2003-04 and 2009-10 and it didn't do any good. The difference is leadership. This year we don't have much leadership available in Washington from either party and the challengers in the coming election seem even less likely to offer any.<p>So don't get your hopes up.<p>[0] Showdown At Gucci Gulch by Murray and Birnbaum is the classic book about the 1986 reform",1348190048

From my own personal experience I can tell you that's not true at all. I also have a friend who's so dyslexic that he can't drive. He's so crippled by it that he can't even type in his own pin number. If he needs money from the bank I'll drive him and get the cash out of the ATM for him.

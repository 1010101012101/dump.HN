404544,comment,404504,404512,0,0,stcredzero,,,"Eventually, media and computers are going to change our language from a verbal one to one where instantly synthesized sounds and images will directly portray many of the ideas we now communicate using word abstractions.<p>I'm not the originator of this idea.  David Brin had uplifted dolphins doing this in his books.  Since they could ""see"" through echolocation, dolphins could synthesize ""images"" for each other by mimicking what would be the return reflections of imagined objects and directly beam them into each other's heads.<p>It will take many advances in interfaces, but we will eventually get there.  Already, cameraphones and video cameras and media are starting to effect the way we communicate about the past.",1229784573

404542,comment,404009,404406,0,0,rglullis,,,"The problem is that you're confusing a concept with its implementation. If it is a basic programming class, there are a whole lot of concepts that should be learned <i>before</i> worrying about the implementation.<p>Algorithms, variables, program flow, functions. Those are the real fundamentals... things that can even be analyzed in pseudo-code, no need to get into a particular language's idiosyncrasies.",1229784409

It seems to me the overhead of administrating these kinds of system would dwarf any benefit.</i><i></i><p>If you're doing any sort of graphics or video rendering, you eat up all the CPU, RAM and a lot of the disk that you can throw at it.  Regular DV digital video takes up 12 GB per hour.  Uncompressed 1080/24p HD video footage can take over 320 Gigs an hour.

Most semi-pro video editing/3d modeling programs have packages that let you throw up a render farm fairly quickly.",1229782691

However this bullet from the presentation scares me slightly:<p>""No need to know any SQL"".<p>This seems very wrong to me.<p>The Django data model is just a light abstraction over the fundamental model of tables and relationships. If you learned how to work with Django models then you would know the logical constructs of SQL, just not the syntax.<p>Django models are no easier or harder to think about than SQL (just there is less code to write and maintain because the boilerplate is done for you). It is not a quick fix for an inability to master the basics.",1229782446

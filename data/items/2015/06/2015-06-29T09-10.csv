But that&#x27;s because the Tory press is full of vile liars, criminals, and frauds.

The reason that, as he puts it, &quot;the scare was not there from the late 1940s through the 1960s&quot; is because the UK&#x27;s debt level at that time was a legacy of WWII. The UK&#x27;s national debt ballooned during WWII, peaking at 237% in 1946-47, then declined rapidly to less than 50% in 1973.[1]<p>He also fails to distinguish between the degree of austerity imposed in the UK and Europe. In the UK, the Conservative government has taken steps to balance the budget by reigning in public spending (benefits in particular) in order to cut the deficit. It is a world apart from the extreme measures that were imposed on countries like Ireland[2] and Greece[3].<p>For context: The New Statesman is a left-wing publication.

No good comes from a housing bubble like that. Of course, this housing bubble was funded by foreign banks. When people see an opportunity to live in a big house for cheap they just sign on the dotted line. That&#x27;s human nature for ya.<p>Household debt in the Netherlands also way too high, although it&#x27;s unclear whether it will become a disaster in any meaningful sense. Stagnant GDP caused by austerity. No surprise there. I specifically mentioned the Netherlands because they&#x27;re portrayed as a responsible country, in contrast to GIPS countries.<p>Spain&#x27;s labor costs also increased by 50% during the boom (<a href=""http://i.imgur.com/pdHgmf4.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/pdHgmf4.png</a>), so gov&#x27;t spending had to go way up just to provide the same services. Besides, spending a lot of money for a couple of years is no big deal when the country doesn&#x27;t have a big national debt, and Spain didn&#x27;t. Doesn&#x27;t mean Spain&#x27;s fiscal policy was beyond reproach, of course. Ideally speaking a government should have anti-cyclical fiscal policy.<p>Bubbles followed by recessions happen all the time in Western Europe and the US, but the consequences are usually pretty manageable. When it comes to Spain the government was no more irresponsible, but because of the Euro they got pulled into a crushing depression.<p>If you want to argue that <i>every</i> modern government is irresponsible, fine. But if you want to demonstrate that Spain was fiscally irresponsible compared to the rest of Europe or the US you&#x27;re going to need better stats.",1435571453

(a lie)<p>Then, they devaluated the Peso (ARS). from 1 ARS = 1 USD, to 1.4 ARS = 1 USD.<p>Every bank account in USD was converted to ARS, with the new valuation.<p>For a few months, they let the ARS to float freely, and it devaluated heavily. So, people who had a few months before USD deposited in their bank accounts, now had ARS that were quickly loosing its value. And they couldn&#x27;t get it out of their accounts, so it was terrible for them to see their life savings evaporating, without being able to do anything. Some reports indicate that suicides, hearth attacks and strokes peaked at the time.<p>A lot of companies, who had acquired credits (in USD) from foreign institutions during the previous years, were no longer able to pay them back, and had to close, letting lots of people unemployed. One interesting thing that appeared (from a social-experiment perspective) was the following: In some cases, the workers joined and formed cooperatives, took control of the facilities, and continued working without the approval of the former owners, distributing equally the gains of their production (it didn&#x27;t matter what was the position, either manager or janitor, everybody earned the same), as a means to keep their jobs, increase morale and reduce costs. They kept paying their providers, so, from outside, those factories kept working as always. Some may argue that even better, because they were more motivated...<p>The exchange rate reached 4 ARS = USD, and of course, inflation went up. Having the same salaries, but with prices going up quickly, a lot of people (especially the most vulnerable sectors of society) were no longer able to survive.<p>So, reverting to the most basic form of exchange, some people started what was called &quot;Club del Trueque&quot; (barter clubs). People made food, pasties, handicrafts, and exchanged them with other people. Eventually, those clubs grew up, and they started using pseudo-currencies, only valid inside their own clubs, to make trading easier. Of course, the government deemed that activity illegal, because they could not collect taxes... That worked for a time (several months, the most critical), but eventually, fake pseudo-currencies started to appear. It was always suspected that the government was behind the printing of those fake papers as a means of ending that... but anyway, it ended up eroding the trust in the members of those clubs.<p>But every Crisis can also be an opportunity:<p>As people was not able to extract their money from their bank accounts, (and believe it or not, most real state operations here are done in cash... big piles of cash), the real state market went down. 
And If you happened to have money (in foreign currencies) saved in a strong box, suddenly, your money had more value.
I have friends who bought their first apartment back then. Others took credit in pesos at the beginning of the crisis (before indexation), and after a few years, the can say that they bought their house for 1/5 of their current value. (because the indexation they had was much much lower than inflation).<p>At a country level, it was a reboot. Which can be bad, and it can also be good. Having most of the indebted companies closed, new stronger companies had space to flourish. Given that now Argentina was a &quot;NO-NO&quot; place to invest for foreign companies, local companies had more chance to grow and expand. During the previouse years, most factories were not able to compete with Asian competitors, because of their cheaper prices. But having devaluated, and imposing imports restrictions (to avoid loosing foreign currency), factories had a new chance to increase regain the local market, with cheaper labor costs.<p>And being defaulted and bankrupted, the country was able to renegotiate most of the debts, reducing heavily the external debt.<p>All of this, worked for a few years. GDP Growth was high (>8). Unemployment descended. Social stability started to come back. Capital controls were relaxed. Central Bank&#x27;s currency reserves went up year after year.<p>But eventually, that fast growth ended up being poison in the long term.  As new industries started to work, it turns out that we didn&#x27;t have the infrastructure to support them (and what&#x27;s worse, we didn&#x27;t make plans and started to invest with time). Power shortages came back (something that became uncommon since the privatizations). Roads were collapsed. And our cargo train lines were almost destroyed. But the real deadly bullet came with oil. As petrol prices started to go up, transport became expensive (this is a big country, mainly connected by roads). And with our new energy requirements, (to fuel our power plants) we passed from being a net oil exporter to beign a net oil importer... And with oil imports, currency reserves started to go down again.<p>So, here starts the story again:  heavier import controls, it&#x27;s harder to send money out of the country, very hard again to buy foreign currencies... but at least, this time around, it&#x27;s not a financial crisis. Banks are not at risk, and people and local companies are not indebted in foreign currencies.  So, it&#x27;s bothersome, but not nearly as bad this time around as it was in 2001. There&#x27;s simply no comparison.<p>But of course, Argentina is not comparable with Greece. Argentina is MUCH larger (8th, vs 97th), bigger population, and lots of natural resources (gas, oil, mining, agriculture, fishing, uranium). So, if forced, Argentina can survive totally on its own. But sadly, I don&#x27;t think Greece can do the same.<p>Phew!. that was a large post...",1435570401

In the words of Warren Buffet, we don&#x27;t talk about &#x27;quality&#x27; of GDP enough.<p>There&#x27;s a nice paper by Mankiw on the topic of science vs  engineering in economics:<p><a href=""https://www.nber.org/papers/w12349"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.nber.org/papers/w12349</a>",1435569198

But they don&#x27;t have to be in the OS. You could implement them in the application container.<p>A difficulty with security services being tied to the OS is that you&#x27;re tied to the featureset of the OS, which tends to have a slow-moving API. Much better to implement security via library, so it can move at the same pace as your application platform.<p>There are many ways to build a unix. Unix is strong at hardware interaction (drivers, filesystems), IPC, process control. Security models dilute it. This includes chmod-style filesystems permissions in that. It&#x27;s lots of complexity that delivers little value.<p>Curious: Stallman built GNU on unix. He&#x27;s an open guy himself, and had spent a lot of time with MIT systems that didn&#x27;t implement security in the OS level.",1435569076

I used to work from home, so I had a box set up that would run a simple c program that would send keys to repeat a macro based on what I wanted to train, but at random intervals.  I did this because I wanted to keep up with my buddy, who had the time to actually play.  But I also had a small bit of code that I injected that would scrape the text.  I would set my character on a boat, and then when a mod would show up, it would beep from the PC internal speaker (so I wouldn't get caught if my wife turned down the volume on the speakers).  I can't count the number of times talking to some directoe or VP while this high pitched noise came across on a conference call while I panicked to explain the noise, have a conference call, and type enough to convince that I was a person.

Non-cryptographic rng s have no such guarantee, so even given a truly random seed and a single value taken from the rng, one might still know something about the distribution of the rng's output that will allow them to know what values are more likely to have been produced, therefore allowing them to launch a brute force attack using the most likely values first, reducing the number of attempts they can expect to need in order to find the correct key.

They are however thematic in a number of theologies. In my experience though people who practice them are happier than those who don't.

The game sometimes has ""actual gameplay"" and sometimes doesn't really, but in practice mainly revolves around the rest of the rules - over 100 of them - including things like multiple privilege levels for rules, a court to decide questions and punish rulebreaking, assets that you can give someone to let them act on behalf of you, a bill of rights, offices, and, of course, proposals, all of which is written in a rather formal and pedantic style that's nevertheless the subject of much debate over interpretation.  The whole thing somehow feels like maintaining a computer program written in English, and perhaps for that reason, many players are programmers; as a particular example, one valid way to play is to find bugs in the rules and try to exploit them to force through a proposal granting you a (temporary) dictatorship, which is like nothing so much as computer hacking.

4890624,comment,4890481,4890481,25,0,simonsarris,,,"A bit more back story on UO, ported from my comment in the Nomic thread.<p>UO was divided into Trammel (safe from PvP) and Felucca (not), and some servers only had Fel. Originally, there was only Fel, and Trammel was made to entice more players who might not want such a cutthroat environment.<p>In Fel as soon as you left a city you were more or less fair game to die from an <i>extremely</i> hostile environment. PC Gamer (If I recall) described the learning curve of UO as ""A frozen wall of acid."" Brutal, but <i>very exciting.</i> A wild west MMO.<p>(In Fel) UO was a rare RPG where anyone could kill anyone, for any reason, but with the repercussion that they would be branded a ""Bad person"" (visible with a gray or red name instead of blue). Stealing from good people corpses also did this. Anyone can attack and kill bad persons, and if you killed even more people you were a murderer and it took a very long time to return to normal.<p>This Blue/Gray/Red name system created a sort of cautiousness among travelers. Being near a pack of ""blue"" people might be safe, since any person that tried to steal or kill would turn gray and they'd immediately kill him.<p>Unless of course, all those blue-named people were conspiring, and you are the target.<p>You want to use super awesome powerful gear? None of this sissy MMO stuff. Die and you lose it, and your enemy (or his enemy!) gets the spoils. An insurance system was added later (2005ish?) where you could pay a certain amount per item to not lose it, probably also as an attempt to make the game less harsh.<p>The problem I have with a lot of MMOs is that the power of your character is simply how much time you sink into the game. Essentially, MMOs are games that reward wasting time.<p>UO had so much more than that. UO was a game where treachery and sneakiness really paid off, if you wanted them to. Lots of ways to nearly instantly kill or entrap people lead to a lot of very exciting plots where guilds might be laden with spies. Absolutely nothing like the ridiculously limited PvP found in games like WoW.<p>In a lot of ways it was the Diplomacy (diplomatic back-stabbing board game) of MMOs. And it was great.<p>--------<p>For more also see outworlder's excellent comment in the Nomic thread: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4890513"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4890513</a><p>The criticisms of UO wiki page is also a very good read, especially the housing and economy sections: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_Ultima_Online"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_Ultima_Online</a>",1354940379

For any language to be considered a system programming language I think it must do whatever assembly language does, obviously with better syntax. Stack manipulation, memory access and transfer, software and hardware interrupts/ports access and obviously logic and arithmetic.<p>Andrew Tanenbaum taught us that a computer and its software  can be defined as one translating layer sitting on top of another. At the basic level you find the electrical circuits inside the chips. Above that you find microcode which defines assembly language. Above that you find the bios. Above that you find the Operating system and finally above that you find application, userland software.<p>The problem with .Net languages and Java is that they sit in userland, four steps away ""from the metal"". So another way to define system software is software that's within 3 layers of abstraction/translation ""from the metal"". When you have defined system software, you have defined system programming. 
To summarize: as long as your language can be cleanly translated to basic assembler and can do stack manipulation, ports/interrupt access and memory manipulation, it can be considered a system programming language. Pascal was used in the first implementations of Mac OS and even some versions of BASIC could have that capability like XBASIC (www.xbasic.org) or Freebasic (www.freebasic.net) without loading additional libraries (at least read their manuals before considering the contrary).<p>One last thing: KILL THAT DUCK.

That is, real players disconnect to go to bed or (heaven forbid) to go to work and are therefore not online the majority of the time""<p>Other insights:<p>""An interesting economic phenomenon occurred concerning the fee charged by vendors. When they were first implemented, vendors charged a fee based on the resource price of their inventory regardless of their sales. With this in mind, clever players realized that they could set the price for the goods to be extraordinarily high and thus prevent anyone from buying them. This, it turned out, was a very effective way of creating a safety-deposit box since the vendors can not be robbed. Players started buying vendors for the sole purpose of increasing their hoarding space. This exacerbated hoarding problems and also resulted in a form of suburban sprawl where people built tents and attached vendors consuming valuable land. The designers ultimately fixed these problems with an elegant economic solution: the vendors now charge a fee based on the value of the goods assigned by the player. Thus, players can still set the values too high, but they will be charged rent proportionately thus deterring this practice dramatically.""<p>And another<p>""...almost all characters are forced to be entrepreneurs of some type, a fact which doesnt correspond well to these players real life. In other words, most people in real life generate their incomes from employment contracts and thus they understand these arrangements. Unfortunately, such employment contracts are not implemented in UO. Therefore, there is naturally disappointment when players are forced into being entrepreneurs and find that this job is not effortless.""",1354940178

She was in Hospice care for 2 years before passing. She knows how passionate I am about science and the ""prove-ability"" of things. So we made a secret pact. We agreed on a secret pass-phrase that only we two know. The deal is.. that as she passed to the other side, if in fact there is another side, then she would get this pass-phrase to me somehow. Now, this pass-phrase is very unique and there is no way anyone could guess it.

I'm in no way whatsoever trying to pass judgement on the wrong or rightness of that, but I don't think it's arguable that Google must find a way to make Android a profitable endeavor for it to see continued active development and promotion.<p>The Android vs. iOS US/UK growth numbers lately have not been kind to Android and Android's greater number of devices still represent a lower amount of web traffic in North America (and on the decline lately). It's a very premature assumption to claim that Android will be lucrative enough in developed demographics to fund overall development. As long as Google is actually losing money on every Android device sold (due to the patent licensing), simply focusing on the number of devices sold is a very poor metric for the platform's long term success.",1354939758

In particular comparing them to 'drains' in the physical world like fashion changes or upgrade cycles.",1354939738

It isn't that students are unaware that MIT is an immensely talented community and just fail to put their own relative difficulties into perspective. There is a strong desire to feel like you belong among your peers. Yet there is always someone doing something that seems out of your reach, which amplifies those lingering internal questions of whether your actually good enough to be there.",1354939710

It doesn't take a ""crazy weight"" or ""a lot of elevation"". And the difference between 50% efficiency and 100% efficiency is only a factor of two; that's well within the range of making reasonable adjustments in the weight and/or height.<p>As far as voltage/amperage is concerned, I would expect the generator to be low voltage DC, matched to some voltage in the range the LED light could support. AFAIK LED lights are fairly tolerant of a range of low DC voltages, so I don't see this as a major issue.",1354939643

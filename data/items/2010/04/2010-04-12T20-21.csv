The law makes a distinction between short-term and long-term gains: if there's less than a year between when you invest and when you cash out, you pay the same tax rate as for ordinary income.  If there's a year or longer, then you pay the more favorable tax rate of 15%.  If you lose money investing, you can claim the loses on your tax return and use them to offset gains in future years.",1271105935

I am developing an text-to-web advertising platform and I am stuck at a point. Short description of how it works: Any one can text a 140 character message to a short code, and have it displayed on any website that is on the network of the advertising platform. My Problem: How do I display the text ad on the websites that are on the platform? Iframes? Flash?<p>These are my reasons for creating this platform. 1. This product is made with the local market in mind (Nigeria, West Africa), I doubt if this would be a hit in the first world. 2. Due to lack of a reliable payment gateway for local users here in Nigeria, I decided to use premium sms (short code). Once an advertiser texts an ad to the shortcode, his prepaid credit is debited, his ad appears on the target website of his choice and the revenue is shared between the ad platform, the shortcode provider and the website owner. 3. Google adsense or adwords isnt too attractive here in Nigeria because of the hassles of getting paid by google another case of reoccurring online payment gateway issues.

As this list points out, it would be very foolish to. Their SDK EULA only applies to the SDK software, not to any other compilers, and using it as a ""heuristic"" for what will or won't be accepted to the AppStore is completely at their discretion. Ouside of the Hacker News top stories, this is pretty common knowledge, see:<p><i>We've heard directly from Unity Technologies themselves, and the company's CEO, David Helgason, has been in contact with Apple over the matter. Helgason says that so far Unity has ""no indication from Apple that things are going to change."" This is consistent with John Gruber's viewpoint on the new iPhone OS 4.0 dev agreement. Gruber originally thought that Unity3D would be a prime candidate for banning under the new rules, but given that Unity3D is, in Gruber's words, ""a pre-processor than a cross-compiler,"" it's nowhere near as certain that Unity will fall on what Gruber calls ""the wrong side of the line"" per the new dev agreement.</i><p>Source: <a href=""http://www.tuaw.com/2010/04/08/iphone-os-4-0-dev-agreement-blocks-using-flash-or-unity-as-ides/4"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tuaw.com/2010/04/08/iphone-os-4-0-dev-agreement-b...</a>",1271104119

We have left internal (Office) and external (lots and lots of folks) customers in the dust by only building decent managed tools. That's my opinion.<p>What I really wanted to address was performance. There was indeed a huge push after Beta2 to improve perf. At the end of the day 2010 is still slower than 2008 and eats up more memory. I guess that's an accomplishment if sucking less is considered good. But will people upgrade? I don't know. Hopefully because that's good for me. But I am pessimistic and currently looking for other employment as the experience was that bad.<p>Why was it so bad? Well I feel most of the pain points could have been avoided. Management ignored a lot of the performance/memory issues last summer and had an attitude of ship ship ship with NO regard for quality. I was responsible for reporting an overall grade for the areas I tested. I reported them to be poor and fair. I also listed all the known bugs in those areas. Management boosted the rating to good on the basis that memory and performance bugs don't count.<p>Let me reemphasize that last point: I was told memory and performance bugs DID NOT count towards the overall quality rating of the product. This was management's attitude through most of the product cycle. We could never give an honest assessment of the product because they would challenge it and argue that it wasn't that bad.<p>I believe their reason was simple for doing this. They need to take the data to their managers and up the chain of command to paint a pretty picture of how great the product is. Even if that's an illusion. Basically telling the truth of product quality is punished. If I lied about quality managers would be ecstatic about how a great a job we did. If I told the truth about quality instead of thanking me for figuring out where customer pain points might be the attitude was ALWAYS this should have been found earlier. The problem is many times I did find it earlier and they did their best to bury it before the next meeting they were heading off too report product quality.<p>I will say this. IntelliSense is much better for C++. Even though other native tools might suck. IntelliSense teams seems to be doing a pretty good job. It has always has been my favorite VS feature.",1271103854

First, it's a sign to others who would do the same thing that Apple is doing, that we don't like it.  If we didn't say anything, others might assume it's accepted, and do the same thing.  This would be harmful.<p>Secondly, if this ""rage"" is loud enough, it might make Apple change their mind, or come to some compromise.  While this wouldn't solve the problem, nor would people forget (two reasons I don't think Apple will change this), it would force Apple to recognize the folly of it's ways.  Apple is focused on the user experience, and in this case, the user is the developer.<p>Next, their intent is not the same as their actions.<p>""I don't see them deciding to drop cross platform game engines.""<p>But they are.  And it's not the official store.  It's the only store.<p>You make the mistake of thinking that ""rage"" is itself useless.

Lots of ""rage-less"" discussion has occurred, and much of it, I believe, a result of reason rising above the general rage, and exists because there was rage to begin with.<p>Finally, something has happened.  You say it's ""changed language in their dev agreement for an unreleased platform.""  But when should people complain? After it's released?  No, the time to complain is when it's previewed.

1260260,comment,1259792,1260182,0,0,akeefer,,,"I think it's a reasonable argument, but it's perhaps not stated as well as it could be.  It's a response to the (presumed) justification from Apple that they want to do this because cross-compiled applications are often low-quality.  So the argument is that if Apple wanted to weed low-quality applications out of the app store, then they should do that based on the quality of the applications, rather than based on the implementation techniques.<p>Clearly, though, the fact that the app store is already flooded with low-quality applications is indicative of the fact that Apple hasn't been doing that, which makes that justification seem totally bogus:  if they really cared about low-quality applications, they could have done something about it long ago without restricting cross-compilation techniques.  And if they wanted to put a stop to it now, they could still do it without restricting cross-compilation.<p>So to extend your analogy:  if you want to weed the garden, then pull the weeds already.

When I went to Peru to drink aya, we were specifically disallowed to take any Western medicines, except an anti-malarial, without consulting the shaman first (and had to discontinue use of them weeks before going down there), leaving completely aside the strict dietary and other restrictions during and for some time after the trip.<p>They've been doing this for thousands of years; I'm pretty sure they have far a better idea of the risks than your comment seems to me to intimate. (Assuming, of course, that they aren't just <i>brujos</i>, there primarily to take the <i>gringo's</i> money. That's not a problem with the medicine as much as it is with the practitioner, however.

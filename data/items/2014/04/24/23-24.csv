7643899,comment,7643625,7643625,5,0,rdl,,,"There are some systems where blockchain technology will be really useful (#1 for me is zerocash for non-government-sanctioned transactions, but that probably won&#x27;t be ready for real use until 2015; not the least of which because we need more secure wallets and other systems to handle a fully anonymous irrevocable currency than even what we have for bitcoin today).<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s going to take over everything.  One, a decentralized network of distinct currencies with an exchange is a better route to decentralization than centrally-coordinated protocol-decentralized currencies for a variety of reasons (performance, ease of modeling, ...); two, a lot of things are inherently centralized.<p>On OP&#x27;s third point about reversibility being a feature -- the solution to that is to leave funds in escrow.  So, you can do $100 transactions as long as you have $100 at-risk in an escrow transaction, and can do an aggregate volume of transactions up to the amount you have on deposit.  Maybe some more sophisticated risk modeling there, too (older accounts, lower risk transactions, etc. take less of your deposit balance).",1398383984

Blockchains are important because they allow a large number of strangers to trade with each other, to exchange value, free from centralized control, corruption and skimming. Millisecond response times would be nice, but that&#x27;s a secondary feature.<p>2) The first people to mine or invest in a new cryptocurrency can be far wealthier than those who come later.<p>How is this different or worse than the status quo? Those who invest their time, money and ingenuity in a risky project reap rewards if it succeeds.<p>3) Centralized authority is required for arbitration and reversing transactions.<p>This assumption is exactly what blockchains and cryptocurrencies are testing. Can people exchange value freely, without a central authority that skims unearned value for itself? Can we enforce complex agreements without submitting to a power that stifles innovation?<p>The final chapter hasn&#x27;t yet been written, but the experiment looks very promising so far.",1398383829

If not, we&#x27;d just use the sun.&quot;</i><p>A common misconception, but untrue.<p>What matters isn&#x27;t power per area but cost per kilowatt-hour. To collect solar power on Earth you need a lot of expensive components (photovoltaic cells), plus you probably need to track the sun, and even so you&#x27;ll have huge losses due to night-time, weather, winter sun angle, and so on. In comparison, a rectenna array is just a bunch of little bent pieces of wire. It&#x27;s almost trivially inexpensive to build, and in some cases it can live side by side with other land uses. Even if the power density is only a few hundred watts m^2 (compared to over a kilowatt/m^2 from the sun at peak power) that power can be converted with upwards of 80% efficiency (compared to much less than 50% efficiency) and the full amount of that power is available 24/7 through every season. The hypothetical 1kw/m^2 at noon on a summer&#x27;s day actually rounds out to only a tiny fraction of that over the entire year. Meanwhile, a rectenna converting 100 W/m^2 of RF power can end up producing the same average power as a solar installation, except that power is always available and the cost of the ground component is a teeny, tiny fraction of the ground solar installation.<p>That still leaves the cost of the space component, of course, which is decidedly non-trivial. But a big advantage is that the space component can have a very, very long service life and can also serve various markets (especially remote regions where power delivery is difficult) which can provide the up-front high-profit business to pay off its cost.",1398382597

Why has the monopoly ISP built the infrastructure ? Because it was a public company, and if you wanted your house to be connected to the network they had to do it. Why have the others built their own ?

I know this because our office is hard to find, and they generally phone me to say they can&#x27;t locate us. Whenever I&#x27;ve gone outside to meet the delivery driver, I&#x27;ve seen the van full of Amazon packages and asked if he does deliveries for anyone else. They&#x27;ve have told me they &quot;only&quot; deliver for Amazon and won&#x27;t really be pushed on the matter.<p>I think pretty soon those vans are going to have Amazon branding on them and a few courier companies will be wondering where their business went...",1398382229

7643776,comment,7643625,7643625,16,0,malanj,,,"The author is missing the fact that the world has adapted to the requirement for centralised trust. That makes it very hard to see the value of a blockchain system - you automatically think about problems and solutions within another constrained framework. It&#x27;s similar to e-mail before people used email. It seems laughable now, but it wasn&#x27;t obvious why e-mail would be useful (&quot;I need to switch on my computer every time to check if I have a message!? A phone is so much easier...&quot;). The value of a blockchain system will become more and more evident over time as we use it to solve problems that are hard to see in our current paradigm.<p>Comparing the blockchain directly with centralised switching systems is like comparing e-mail with phone calls, and using &quot;ability to speak&quot; as the metric of comparison. E-mail allows you to do something else, but it took us a while to realise that something else is incredibly valuable. The blockchain will be the same. Simple example: we don&#x27;t even think in terms of individuals or corporations issuing their own currency. It&#x27;s not a &quot;problem&quot; that we generally acknowledge to exist. We&#x27;ll certainly see it as one worth solving when companies and rich individuals start using blockchain technology to compete with countries in terms of issuing currency.",1398382116

There&#x27;s an interpreter so that you can run your algorithms on concrete values to make sure that, for example, your test vectors check out. There&#x27;s also a symbolic simulator for building formal models of the functions you define, so that you can prove properties about those programs using SMT.<p>Previous versions of Cryptol included backends for producing C and VHDL for higher-performing implementations on CPUs and FPGAs. Cryptol 2 is a ground-up rewrite and those backends aren&#x27;t there yet, though we have plans to be working on new backends soon.<p>Cryptol is largely focused on issues of functional correctness. For power and timing attacks, you might want to build a C or Assembly implementation by hand that addresses those. However, what you&#x27;re left with is fairly difficult to reason about on the level of functional correctness. We have another project, the Software Assurance Workbench, that builds formal models from LLVM and Java code. With this in hand, you prove equivalence between the hardened, high-performance implementation and the Cryptol specification.<p>Does that help clarify the role Cryptol might play in a cryptographer&#x27;s workflow?

7643645,comment,7642900,7643470,42,0,danudey,,,"A lot of the hate I&#x27;ve seen for Google+ centred around being badgered constantly to &#x27;use my real name&#x27; on things. YouTube was a particularly egregious example. Every time I logged in, it would say &#x27;Hey, do you want to use your real name? How great would that be!&#x27; When I said no, it would reply with &#x27;Hey, are you sure you want to not use your real name?&#x27;, and if I then confirmed that no, I didn&#x27;t want to, it would say &#x27;Okay, well we&#x27;ll ask you later then.&#x27;<p>If they had just said that &#x27;Okay, your Google profile is now called Google+, and your YouTube account attached to your Google Profile is now your Google+ profile, and you can go to your settings to complete the migration&#x27;, it wouldn&#x27;t have been so bad. What they didn&#x27;t do is offer anyone any reason to change.<p>All the benefits they hawked for YouTube&#x27;s Google+ comment integration were actually such huge drawbacks that many top YouTubers turned off comments entirely. Unsurprisingly, YouTube comments had gone from the mindless, racist, misspelled prattling of the internet&#x27;s ignorant masses to giant spam-filled, link-filled dumping grounds of (varyingly) penis enlargement spam and giant ASCII dicks, and YouTube comments went from bad to worse, a feat no one thought possible.<p>It really feels like the decision was made for the YouTube team by someone else (Page? Gundotra?), and the YouTube team just had to roll with it, with their input being ignored and the Google+ team saying &#x27;No it&#x27;ll be great, don&#x27;t worry, you&#x27;ll see, everything is better with Google+!&#x27;<p>To this day, people invite me by gmail address to threads, which I cannot leave unless I tie my Google account to a Google+ account so I can join the thread so I can leave the thread.<p>The entire thing was a clusterfuck from start to finish, and everything that they wanted out of it could have been accomplished by providing value, rather than extrinsic rationalization.",1398380447

So why would they add compatibility for that now? Why not just write your own parser that reads types annotations and then outputs Cython-equivalent variables declartions?<p>There are also some Cython specific types that you won&#x27;t find, for example the functions can be either cdef or cpdef, depending if you plan to use them from C only, or C and Python.<p>I still see value in learning Cython as a complement to Python, for the cases where you need to get &quot;closer to the metal&quot;.

9830738,comment,9830212,9830212,0,0,csixty4,,,"There was a discussion about Mondo 2000 here on HN maybe a year ago, and I remember someone commenting that they & all their friends growing up in California saw Mondo as a huge joke. Their parents and older friends were all working with VR and the Internet and it was nothing like Mondo made it out to be. They couldn&#x27;t believe anybody took it seriously.<p>One of the replies really resonated with me. Growing up in the midwest in the mid-90s, where scarcely anyone had heard of the Internet, Mondo was paradise. It portrayed a humanistic, technophilic world of sex, drugs, and high technology so far away from the humble, conservative &quot;Breadbasket of North America&quot; around us.<p>I have a full run of Mondo 2000 I intend to scan someday. Flipping through those back issues, it really does feel silly today. But back then, each of those issues symbolized hope for me. I kept a stack next to my bed for inspiration. I would dream about the future I was about to create.<p>Looking back, that&#x27;s why I was so disappointed with college the first time around. I spent the last couple years of high school drooling over virtual reality rigs and cyberspace, only to have a required COBOL class my freshman year. I dreamed of dropping out and moving to San Francisco where all the cool people were, people who understood technology and the limitless future that lies before us.<p>Timothy Leary was my hero, and I wept the day he died. I tried reading Chaos and Cyberculture[1] again a couple years ago and it felt like barely-coherent word vomit. But in 1994 it blew my mind.<p>I worry that this will be the legacy of Mondo 2000 and its ilk. Taken out of context, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s 90% &quot;weird for the sake of weird&quot; crap. Although I must say that it&#x27;s beautifully illustrated crap, pushing the limits of 1990s hardware and software. And that&#x27;s the thing - so much of Mondo&#x27;s value is in its context. The team behind Mondo were cyberspace missionaries spinning tales of a digital utopia, inspiring us to realize it. When the mainstream went grunge, they went digital. I feel like my passion for open source today springs from that same dream of a global kumbaya we were promised decades ago.<p>[1] <a href=""https://drytoasts.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/timothy-leary-chaos-cyber-culture.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://drytoasts.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/timothy-leary-...</a>",1436029122

Yes, it is unfortunate the conditions[0] that some blacks live in, but there has to be a point, a line that is not crossed and if it is the individual is held fully responsible. Why shouldn&#x27;t all adults be held responsible for their actions? What good does it do to send an infantilizing message saying, &quot;If you want to commit a heinous and horrific murder, don&#x27;t worry we&#x27;ll take the blame :)&quot;?<p>Do you think &quot;affluenza&quot;[1] was a worthy defence and justified not holding the person in Texas who killed people while drunk driving accountable?<p>Also, how does your assertion that poverty among blacks is the main if not sole cause of their elevated murder rates square with the fact that the murder rates among impoverished whites is not comparable?<p>-<p>[0]It is also unfortunate and misguided to place responsibility and thus responsibility to solve the problem solely on outside groups. What outside group or society should we blame for the relatively materially impoverished state of some Australian Aborigine, Papua New Guinean, Sub-Saharan African, and American Indian groups that was discovered upon their first contact with other groups? Some people just live in different ways, owing in part to the selection pressure of the environments they evolved in over many years, there&#x27;s no reason to blame anyone for that.<p>[1]<a href=""https://duckduckgo.com/?q=texas+jury+affluenza"" rel=""nofollow"">https://duckduckgo.com/?q=texas+jury+affluenza</a>",1436028997

9830731,comment,9827051,9830687,0,0,steveklabnik,,,"Currently, lifetimes are based entirely on lexical scope. So for example, this doesn&#x27;t work:<p><pre><code>    fn main() {\n        let mut x = 10;\n        let y = &mut x;\n        *y = 11;\n    \n        println!(&quot;{}&quot;, x);\n    }\n</code></pre>\nThis will complain<p><pre><code>    error: cannot borrow `x` as immutable because it is also borrowed as mutable\n</code></pre>\nThis is because an `&mut` borrow is exclusive: while `y` is alive, we cannot use `x`. We can fix this by making a new scope for `y`:<p><pre><code>    fn main() {\n        let mut x = 10;\n\n        {\n            let y = &mut x;\n            *y = 11;\n        }\n    \n        println!(&quot;{}&quot;, x);\n    }\n</code></pre>\nThis works, and will print `11`.<p>Non-lexical lifetimes would allow the compiler to demonstrate that these two things are the same, and allow the first one to compile with the behavior of the second.<p>It&#x27;s an interesting tradeoff, because right now, the rules are very simple and conservative. Scope is fairly easy to reason about. Non-lexical lifetimes would make certain things easier, but also a bit harder to reason about, because the rules are more complex.",1436028969

When a protocol has survived and continued in use for so long there are usually deep-seated reasons why it is a fit for certain use cases. I don&#x27;t want to go off on a chat vs. mail rant, but the following ...<p>>> You operate on a level of the entire messages flow. Forums, chats and web 2.0 networks are trying to make conversations feel as lightweight and barrier-free as possible.<p>... caught my eye. I manage a team of younger developers for whom real time chat is simply the way they grew up interacting. Everyone is signed into hangouts and &quot;operating on a level of the entire messages flow&quot; (sic) all day long. A large part of the interaction is off topic, vague, and ineffective. Here&#x27;s an example from yesterday...<p>Dev 1: the repo url is wrong, I&#x27;m getting a 404.<p>Dev 1: wait, might be a typo.<p>Dev 1: my bad.<p>Everyone on the team received this message and presumably stopped their current mental task at least long enough to read it, as I did. In the end it had no impact whatsoever. The developer clearly should have thought through his problem before notifying the entire team that he had one. But this is how chat is used.<p>I&#x27;ve tried very often to get them to be more deliberate in chat communications, without any success. I have also tried to encourage complicated topics to move quickly to voice hangouts, with even less success. Streams of real time chat messages remains the primary way the group interacts, to the point where I have backed off my efforts and come to the conclusion that I&#x27;m likely the one who has to change.<p>That said, there will always be a need for deliberate communications within organizations. Email grew up as an analog for letters and memos, which served as deliberate, archived, time-stamped records of an important communication. They were considered, usually minimal (because they took effort to create), and got to the point. They were events, not streams of ephemera. I&#x27;m not sure that this constant buzz of chats does a good job of replacing that. So for that reason the sentence &quot;You operate on a level of the entire messages flow&quot; doesn&#x27;t make me smile.",1436028745

Population density is one reason, but infrastructure planning and preferences is a big part of it. Most Americans live in the populated parts of the country in or near a city, not in rural Nevada or Nebraska, so those huge expanses on their own don&#x27;t make public-transit impractical (they do complicate <i>intercity</i> rail, but that&#x27;s a different issue).<p>Urban sprawl does make things more difficult, but doing better than the current state would still be quite possible in many cities. For example, taking the two most recent cities I&#x27;ve lived in, Houston and Copenhagen have closer population densities than people may think in the majority of their commute basin. If you draw a circle with radius roughly 30 km from each city&#x27;s downtown, both have a density of about 1,000/km^2. Yet Copenhagen has 5 commuter rail lines, a subway, and an extensive 24-hour bus network, while Houston has 3 light-rail lines and a pretty bad bus network. So of course it&#x27;s harder to get around in Houston without a car, even in the dense parts (for example, it&#x27;s a huge pain to get from a high-rise condo in the Galleria area to an office building downtown, even though these are both dense areas and only about 15km apart). Houston is <i>slowly</i> improving in the past 10 years, though.",1436028695

The second is to express musical ideas that don&#x27;t fit within the bounds of SN.<p>But in my view, the reason why SN remains in use, is that there&#x27;s a symbiosis between composers who can write it, and musicians who can sight-read, i.e., perform it directly from the sheet. Tabulature, or other pictographic notations don&#x27;t work because the composers don&#x27;t intimately know all of the instruments that they&#x27;re writing for (including the variety of tuning and fingering systems for each instrument), and nobody knows how to sight-read those notations.<p>Another issue with any method involving computer graphics, is that there are still a surprising number of composers who use pencil and paper, because notation software is so cumbersome.<p>In one band that I&#x27;m in, the composer brings new material to each rehearsal. It&#x27;s all written out by hand.",1436028323

In the decade up to 2011, the number of deaths on the road jumped by 44.2 per cent.<p>A rough calculation of the data in the World Health Organisation&#x27;s global status report on road safety 2013, on the number of registered vehicles and the number of estimated road traffic fatalities around the world, indicates that in India, there is an average of one death for every 840 vehicles. Meanwhile, China has one death for 2,942 vehicles, while the US has one death for every 7,847 vehicles.<p>What&#x27;s more, the majority of road fatalities in India (65%) occur on state and national highways and 78% of all road fatalities are attributed to human errors, such as speeding, inattention, drunken driving and prediction errors.<p>But if you take Death per thousands, you can see India is at parity with the world.

What kind of noise spectrum due your images have, how does increasing contrast affect things, what about the spacial frequency distribution in the images themselves, and so on... Different fields have radically different &quot;typical&quot; images and the attempts at covering a reasonable range of the in traditional papers were not necessarily very limited.<p>Instead, I see this model of publication as exploiting the possibilities of the &#x27;Net to allow more effective communication and collaboration. And it <i>is</i> publication: it is making public, which is what makes the difference between science and alchemy... if there had been a &quot;Proceedings of the Alchemical Society&quot; we&#x27;d have had chemistry a thousand years ago.<p>What this model of publication does not (yet) have is a reputation mechanism, but it isn&#x27;t clear it needs one, because you can see the results (and the code) for yourself. As such, I think the author has not only done something interesting in the image compression space, they are pointing the way on the future of scientific publication.<p>Measuring this model as if it could be described as a certain amount of progress along a line toward the old endpoint is mistaken.

If you flip a score 90 degrees, you end up with this, with the notes laid out over the keys. Compared to almost all other instruments pianos are ideally suited to sheet music. Manuscript notation is also (necessarily) very information dense.<p>It&#x27;s an interesting approach; there are apps that will do something similar to this. They&#x27;re very much like guitar hero. Some of the newer electric pianos will even illuminate the keys in the correct order.<p>I think one of the reasons that guitarists use tablature is that using sheet music notation for the guitar is more difficult to learn (at least to me).

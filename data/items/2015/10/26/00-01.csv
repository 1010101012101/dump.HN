10449114,comment,10448038,10448338,0,0,jcranmer,,,"The headline in question is pure clickbait as far as its relevance in the document is concerned. The argument in question was that Wikipedia was so large, and NSA so pervasive, that they had to be snooped on at some point. To which the judge pointed out three things:<p>1. Sure 1 trillion and .00000001% chance of chance leads to a ridiculously certain chance of interpretation. But if you add three 0&#x27;s to the latter number, you get a mere 10% chance. Without any explanation of those numbers, this reads like they chose the smallest number that gave a ridiculously high number--in other words, the argument is an attempt at pure statistical bullshittery. (I do like the judges retort in particular: &quot;The &quot;speculative&quot; reasoning foreclosed by Clapper cannot be avoided by dressing &quot;a chain of possibilities&quot; in the clothing of mathematical certainty when the calculation lacks a statistical basis.&quot;<p>2. This is only a footnote, but this also assumes that all communications are equally likely to be intercepted, which a priori reasoning would suggest is not the case.<p>3. It&#x27;s actually irrelevant if their numbers are correct, because the numbers and thread of argument relies very heavily on a mere supposition that the NSA is using all of their tools in exactly the ways that they suppose, and this can&#x27;t be used to show that the injury is &quot;real and immediate&quot; instead of &quot;conjectural or hypothetical.&quot;<p>The most troubling part of the ruling to me is something that no one appears to have talked about in any comment section yet: the judge asserts that in these sorts of standing cases, a false negative (rejecting an actual injury as untrialable) is less damaging than a false positive (accepting as trialable something that didn&#x27;t happen), and that judges should be inclined to err on the side of false negatives rather than false positives.",1445821089

Witness Freebase. Are my fears misplaced would you say?<p>I&#x27;ve read that SEP article, I&#x27;ve also read a good bit of Peirce&#x27;s original journal article. As it says in SEP &quot;It should be mentioned that for Peirce there is actually a trichotomy among types, tokens and tones,[...]&quot; - I think it&#x27;s amusing that basically everybody ignores the triadic distinction that Peirce claimed to be the case for a dualistic type/term distinction.<p>I&#x27;m looking forward to going through your tutorial quill in hand and pot of ink at the ready.",1445820697

The simple act of getting them online, even if providing them limited services, can be a gateway to the &quot;Internet&quot; as a whole.<p>Facebook is a company which exists in the end to increase the value for its shareholders so I think it is expected they obviously will try to further their cause i.e. getting everyone on the Facebook platform.

If that&#x27;s a fair assumption + you&#x27;ve got reasonable income and are time poor I&#x27;d suggest an iPhone as it tends to be the more user friendly product (at a price). That said Android is deliver an ever increasing similarly good experience.<p>For someone that likes to tinker, or has a lower income I&#x27;d suggest Android. Android is more flexible to customisation + the phones are at a significantly lower price point either saving you money overall or allowing for more frequent phone updates.<p>I currently run an Android as my personal phone then tend to run a second ever changing OS on my work phone out of general tech interest. Currently I&#x27;m on Windows as the second phone but am getting Sailfish and Ubuntu curious so I feel an upgrade coming. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend the Windows phone from an experience POV (though prices can be great). It&#x27;s maybe 80% as good as iPhone and still needs polishing.

So many people seem to approach code formatting from a point of view of &quot;This is how we&#x27;ve always done it, this is consistent with other previous standards, so this is how it should be.&quot; And then whoever gets the most agreement wins.<p>I don&#x27;t often see discussions based on whether there may be actual engineering advantages to one formatting style vs. another. For example, I put spaces inside the parentheses in my function calls and expressions. Many see that as an arbitrary stylistic choice - and object vehemently to it! - but it actually ties in very closely to the column alignment vs. indentation choice in the examples above.<p>I talked about that in some detail in one of the comments I linked above, so won&#x27;t belabor it further here. :-)<p>Maybe that&#x27;s my beef with coding standards: they tend to take each style decision as an independent, fairly arbitrary choice, instead of listing the goals we&#x27;re looking for and seeing how different style choices may work together to achieve them.",1445820632

The second question is another example in the same vein.<p>1st: For example, was science in a state of confusion until Popper corrected the errors of the logical positivists?<p>Ideas concerning the scientific method are less clear before Popper assuming you buy into Popper, that much is true, that much is true of any advancement in the philosophy of science. What is not true is that before an advancement lay confusion and after the removal of confusion. Progress wends its way slowly, incrementally, with ideas gaining clarity bit by bit. So it has gone and presumably so it will continue until someone presents an argument that the process of the improvement in our understanding of the scientific method is complete. That proof is for you or someone to provide, not I a proof of its counter-claim.<p>2nd: Did the development of plate tectonics have to wait until Kuhn explained the structure of scientific revolutions?<p>No. And you know the answer is no. But so what? If Kuhn is right about how scientific thought progresses it could have an impact on how scientific bodies organise themselves and how funding is allocated and so on, which would have an impact on science at a much larger level than individual hypotheses and theories.

In particular, the scheduler is usually quite expensive to scale, because it needs to compare each completed result against the not-yet-fulfilled sources on waiting instructions.<p>> All the dependency information available to a compiler/runtime is lost when code-generating to x86 (same for ARM), yet a processor core needs to extract the same information again in hardware.<p>I think this is a bit different than what you describe above w.r.t. software dataflow. When you talk about reactive programming in software, dependences are things like event streams or promises that become fulfilled. That&#x27;s very different from (say) an individual 32-bit register value flowing from producer to consumer instruction, and the compiler usually only knows about the latter type of dependence. Perhaps you&#x27;re envisioning a different type of reactive/dataflow programming framework though, like maybe chaining together arithmetic transformations or something similar lower-level?<p>---<p>All of that said, there has been some interesting work in compiling conventional software down to a more &quot;dataflow-like&quot; architecture. See e.g. the TRIPS project at UT Austin [1] from about 10 years ago -- the idea there was to build a fabric of execution units connected by a mesh interconnect on the chip, and then stream data through.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~trips/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~trips/</a>",1445818342

Sure, there&#x27;s a couple legit ones, but the vast majority are massively exaggerated. Especially sites like Debito. If you go on reddit&#x27;s Japan forum (/r/Japan), you mention debito, you&#x27;ll get laughed at. The guy literally profits from pointing out discrimination and intolerance in Japan. That&#x27;s how he makes his money so it&#x27;s in his interest to exaggerate <i>everything</i>. He&#x27;s written books on the matter.<p>I don&#x27;t really want to come across as some overly liberal social justice warrior, but most of those complaints you speak of aren&#x27;t justified. As I stated above, it&#x27;s just 20-something white kids not getting treated the same as they did back home and they&#x27;re not used to it. They&#x27;re used to people bending over backwards for them, receiving handouts and not being ignored. They were sheltered most of their lives (as were the majority of all millennials) so when they get to Japan and get treated differently, all of the sudden it has to be &quot;racism&quot;.<p>That&#x27;s really what&#x27;s happening here. They&#x27;re conflating their culture shock with racism. I&#x27;m an expat myself. I&#x27;ve spoken of my time in Japan here on hackernews several times. I find it&#x27;s no more racist than any other country I&#x27;ve traveled too. In fact, it&#x27;s probably the least racist country I&#x27;ve been to, only behind America.

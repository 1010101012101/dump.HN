163116,comment,163016,163065,0,0,mullr,,,"It does both.<p>It hurts in that the tests add inertia to your codebase.  Radical changes may require you to cut out portions of tests, for better or worse.<p>It helps in that, by writing tests first, your code is more testable.  And thus less tightly coupled to the rest of your code and easier to change without trashing the whole system.  This is the real reason to do TDD: it forces you into doing good design.  This is less painful than you might expect in languages that are not Java.",1208181262

163108,comment,163016,163016,0,0,bk,,,"Short version:<p>Logic errors are much trickier than type errors, so I focus tests on parts with tricky logic.<p>Long version:<p>I really like the BDD approach of thinking about tests as executable specs. Before I write any code, I need to think through how exactly I want my code to behave. While I'm doing this, I might as well capture it in a list of (empty) specs, so that I and others have a clear and concise summary of the code's declared behavior.<p>A lot of web app code is fairly trivial / non-mission-critical, so I don't spend too much time testing it. Instead I focus my effort on the parts where it really matters (e.g. a permissions system that could expose private user information or lead to data loss if a bad code tweak goes unnoticed).<p>Some things I couldn't imagine writing without tests. Right now, I'm building a somewhat complex grammar using a parser generator library, and the only way to stay sane in this process is by building a test suite that alerts me whenever a subtle logic mistake in one of my rules breaks something somewhere else.",1208180218

163106,comment,162698,162888,0,0,Jesin,,,"Meh.  Good points.  I and probably a lot of other people are probably feeling pretty stupid right now for falling for this.  I think I have a certain combination of gullibility and skepticism that makes me a perfect target for these things.  I'm a skeptic in that I am quick to consider that someone could be just <i>wrong</i>, but I'm gullible in that I'm slow to consider the possibility that someone is <i>lying</i>.",1208180128

(<a href=""http://www.helpguide.org/life/sleeping.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.helpguide.org/life/sleeping.htm</a>) I find the difference between seven and a half hours of sleep and six hours isn't bad, but the difference between six hours of sleep and four hours of sleep is much more difficult to deal with.  Looking at the diagram on the linked page, it's obvious why: sleep stages three and four are important and if you sleep less than six hours they get screwed up. More REM sleep gets messed up too, which is also important.<p>Day-to-day energy levels are cyclic too. Every day I want to take a nap at 3:00 in the afternoon. I'm also most energized from around 10:00 to 11:00 in the morning. It's a pattern.<p>A boost of energy at a certain time at night happens likely for the same reason it does during the day: levels of consciousness are cyclic.<p>As far as nighttime being more productive: there are fewer interruptions which means you can concentrate. It's easier when your cell phone/RSS/Twitter/blog/text/email isn't blowing up.",1208179958
163104,comment,162803,162803,0,0,mosburger,,,"I'm thinking about trying out starting a social site soon... I've got a big chunk of it coded already.  My tack was going to be to first create a site with aggregated content, a la popurls, try to get some regular visitors, then introduce social aspects to it if/when that gets any traction.<p>I think this is the approach that original signal took.  I have no idea whether it will work, the aggregated content will have to be damned compelling to make it better than a plain on RSS feed.  Chances are I'll ever even finish the damned thing anyway.  :/  But I figured it'd be worth a shot, if for no other reason than to learn some new stuff and to have a hobby!",1208179956
163103,comment,162884,162884,0,0,shimon,,,"Get involved in organizing some geek events (dinners, hackathons, BarCamps, small conferences on specific technologies or industries) in your city.  Figure out who you'd like to work with and make events that will interest them. Develop the ability to learn about someone's project and offer a constructive suggestion within 5 minutes, and you'll quickly earn a reputation as someone who can listen and respond constructively.  People hire consultants who make them feel awesome, and you should be able to do this at a personal as well as an organizational level.<p>Find some other consultants in related areas and meet them for lunch so you can learn from them.  Established consultants have a lot of extra leads and will often be happy to help you get started.<p>Finally, if you're the kind of person who doesn't already have a great answer for how to do lead generation, you probably won't do a great job of reselling consulting hours.  A good referring consultant has one or more of (1) an incredibly network for lead generation and (2) enough of a bureaucracy to eliminate some of the paperwork hassle of dealing directly with clients.  If you don't have either of these, the sort of consultants who will cost you <10h/week to manage will probably prefer to work on their own rather than cut you a percentage.",1208179901

Most Popular page, plus a few niche sites I find interesting.""<p>Also, ""Interesting things to read"" is a little ambiguous, and could use clarification to emphasize that the site _does_ cover both news and reference texts.  (Or is it even more than that?)  With so much flat-looking text, people are going to read one link and think, ""This is just another less-attractive version of Google News,"" or, ""This is just another link aggregator site, but without arrows for some reason.""<p>Somehow, you've got to make your front-page impression for non-logged-in users both provide a little bit of value (but not the many links you're putting up right now), _and_ immediately and visually demonstrate what makes your site uniquely valuable.<p>The list format feels a little oppressive, for some reason.  I can't put my finger on it, but it just isn't ... fun.<p>Finally, all the links I see initially are about equally interesting to me -- they're all fairly heady math/computer geek stuff.  So I don't even get the initial reward of trimming away (or the fun of condemning) the really trivial stuff I wish wasn't in the news.  I wonder if someone in the 99% of the U.S. population that doesn't care about Boltzmann machines would even try to push past that.",1208178177

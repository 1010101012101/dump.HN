However, little empirical evidence exists to support this assumption. One way to test the hypothesis that a patent system promotes innovation is experimentally to simulate the behavior of inventors and competitors under conditions approximating patent and non-patent systems. Employing a multi-user interactive simulation of patent and non-patent (commons and open source) systems (The Patent Game), this study compares rates of innovation, productivity, and societal utility. The Patent Game uses an abstracted and cumulative model of potential innovations, a database of potential innovations, an interactive interface that allows users to invent, make, and sell these innovations, and a network over which users may interact with one another to license, assign, infringe, and enforce patents. Initial data generated using The Patent Game suggest that a system combining patent and open source protection for inventions (that is, similar to modern patent systems) generates significantly lower rates of innovation (p<0.05), productivity (p<0.001), and societal utility (p<0.002) than does a commons system. These data also indicate that there is no statistical difference in innovation, productivity, or societal utility between a pure patent system and a system combining patent and open source protection.<p>""""""",1360979154

Pharmaceuticals are a good example, it takes a lot of research to design a new potential drug and even more painstaking research to prove that it works and is safe, if you can't guarantee some sort of market protection that gives the developer a chance to recoup their R&D costs then it's questionable whether or not you'd have as many new drugs.<p>But on the other hand, if a patented invention is something that several other folks in the industry would have invented within the next 5 years regardless then patents start to become a drag on progress. It's telling when you see a burst of progress happen after a patent runs out, and that sort of thing happens all the time. The question is how do we strike the right balance.

There would still be bad software patents, but I think this would greatly limit the damage from them. The incentive for trolls would be enormously reduced if they can only extort license fees for a few years, while the lower barrier to entry would make it much easier for small entrepreneurs to actually get patents without going through 20 rounds with the patent office.<p>There needs to be a recognition that in software entire segments are born and die within 20 years (even within 10 years). 20 years protection on a simple idea is way too long, even if it is truly novel.

Perhaps it could do type detection and return what it gets, but then you have the issue that the executing code needs to be aware of that too - which means a type check at the caller before invoking the underscore expression. Needless to say, I think that's a lot of added complexity for not a lot of benefit.<p>Heck, if you really wanted to adapt something from Array.js you could do the naive (but I think correct) thing which is to add a flag to all underscore methods indicating whether or not the method should return an ""Underscored"" object or the basic data type. This could even be an initialization parameter for Underscore.<p>What does this buy you? I can only think of two things. First is they get a more object-oriented feel to their code.<p><pre><code>    var foo = _.filter([1,2,3], func, true);\n    // later on...\n    foo.filter(func2);\n</code></pre>\nI guess the first question I have is, what does line 3 do? Are we mutating foo? Or returning something new? In which case we've managed to save precisely one character<p><pre><code>     _.filter(foo, func2);\n</code></pre>\nEven worse, we're saving the wrong character. One undersung quality of having one global object per major library is that, in the code, you get a <i>big</i> contextual clue about what's going on from the way it's invoked. Contrast these two lines:<p><pre><code>    foo.filter(func2);\n    _.filter(foo, func2);\n</code></pre>\nTry to imagine that you're encountering these lines deep in the bowels of the code. Which one is easier to understand?<p>The second thing you get is a (what I think is) esoteric benefit of being able to ""ship"" underscore functionality with the data to far away places. This is only an issue in full require()-controlled programs where there might be some communication between closures, and one side wants to use underscore in that context, but not add a dependency. Personally, I think being able to do that is just asking for trouble, as, again, your calling code maintainers are going to be totally befuddled by running into objects doing things that no other objects in that side are doing - or worse, doing something that looks familiar, but isn't.",1360977064

(Sarbox)<p>She also doesn't mention the enormous pools of capital available to the secondary market that provides liquidity well ahead of an IPO. It's no longer necessary to IPO for early investors / founders to get rich. See Evernote and Surveymonkey, among others.<p>Finally, she wants there to be more aftermarket support for company stock (presumably to fight off the evil high frequency traders making the market unstable) -- but that's exactly contra what an IPO does!

Food was her indulgence of choice. After years of trying to rid herself of the consequences of that addiction by dieting, she turned to weight loss surgery to help. Sure, she lost a lot of weight but this merely relieved the symptoms of her disease and did nothing the disease itself.<p>Years later she no longer possessed the biological ability to be addicted to food so she turned to alcohol instead. The weight loss surgery combined with only 4 years of alcohol abuse (with several stints of sobriety) was enough to ruin her liver to a point of no return.<p>I don't dispute that this drug could be effective for the newly sober individuals who need a little extra push to remain sober. A doctor that administers this vaccine without careful followup and psychological treatment is doing the patient a disservice.<p>Let's not kid ourselves, this ""vaccine"" does nothing but mask the symptoms of the disease leaving the patient troubled, alone and without help.<p>Addiction is a lifelong disease and it needs to be treated as such.

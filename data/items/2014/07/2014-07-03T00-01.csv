I (as an entrepreneur) wouldn&#x27;t touch it, other than to read her textbooks and homework assignments.<p>It&#x27;s most useful when your field is heavily credentialed.  HN tends to attract folks who look down on credentials and like to believe they&#x27;ll succeed on merit, but the reality is that every success happens because somebody else believes you can do a job well, and in many fields, that somebody relies on very imperfect information.  In philanthropy, for example, not having an MBA is basically a hard blocker for ever reaching a leadership position, because your job is to <i>convince rich people you can deploy their money effectively</i>.  Many of her classmates are in middle-management positions at big companies, and advancement there is similarly restricted to those with credentials.  I&#x27;ve heard that strategy consulting basically requires an MBA beyond the Associate level, because again, you are selling your perceived expertise to the client.<p>As an entrepeneur, though?  I doubt it.  I look at my girlfriend&#x27;s coursework and the homework assumes you have 10x the information and 100x the resources that you actually have as a startup founder.",1404349166

Security consists of buying magical appliances and antivirus software (from your VAR&#x27;s salesperson on a site visit, through your VAR, through their distributors, through their distributors), and that&#x27;s if you&#x27;re lucky. &quot;Security consulting&quot; and PCI auditing consists of selling Nessus scans (again, if you&#x27;re lucky, more likely some no-name proprietary tool) at $100,000 a pop. You&#x27;re lucky if the Network Admin has ever even <i>heard</i> of the myth of the paranoid graybeard UNIX sysadmin. I personally know at least 60% of the people in my city who are qualified to configure high-end Cisco gear - I can count them on my hands - and they&#x27;re nowhere near experts.<p>A &quot;security expert&quot; has maybe been to a sales event marketed as training and knows, at most, that if you absolutely need security, you should install Norton or Symantec anti-virus software.

No one thinks it&#x27;s a problem that half the switching equipment is in an unlocked closet in a patient-accessible hallway. No one thinks it&#x27;s a problem that we don&#x27;t even bother with badging.

Almost all of the people commenting on PH work for PH, so I assume there&#x27;s a lot of dog fooding going on. It&#x27;s a very young product, so it&#x27;s understandable, but I can&#x27;t see that growing unless there&#x27;s more happening there.<p>Some negatives of ProductHunt are that I&#x27;ve had people go through and tweet at <i>everybody</i> who voted for us (including me) because your twitter account is publicly listed when you vote. That&#x27;s kind of annoying.<p>Overall, why not post to PH? But it has a <i>lot</i> of ground to make up before it catches HN. Anecdotally, I check every single &quot;Show HN.&quot; I&#x27;ve maybe clicked on two or three things on ProductHunt, mostly because I don&#x27;t care enough about other people&#x27;s products to seek the site out specifically.",1404348898

It is intentionally confusing and obfuscatory, as you might expect from a senior politician with a lot to lose on a sensitive topic she hopes she can bury with an election coming up.<p>I don&#x27;t know about you, but despite having (unknowingly at the time) walked past a live IRA bomb in my childhood which detonated a few hours later, I feel far more threatened by mass surveillance than by <i>any</i> other state or non-state actor by any means. Mass surveillance has a truly chilling effect upon democracy, upon speech, upon the way we think. It is actively poisonous to freedom. And it <i>is</i> happening - her denials aside, these are not mere <i>assertions</i>: thanks largely to Snowden (and the other, not-so-publicised leakers), they are strongly and undeniably <i>evidenced</i>. Other evidence is available and can be obtained. This action - and Snowden&#x27;s leaks - <i>is</i> the external oversight intended, and needed, to stop mass surveillance - any system of &quot;oversight&quot; in place has clearly failed.<p>Thing is, GCHQ have operated for over two decades now under the understanding that they <i>have</i> authority to actually conduct SIGINT <i>operations</i> at large - but that it&#x27;s the responsibility of <i>analysts</i> internal, external (TSS/SIS/NCA/MoD/etc) and extraterritorial (NSA and the rest of the Five Eyes, etc) that <i>query</i> GCHQ about the <i>results</i> of those operations with specific targeted selectors (search queries; email addresses, names, IP addresses, website names, et al) to obtain sufficient clearance and authority to do so. (Broadly the same doctrine NSA have: that the interception itself isn&#x27;t spying, the search/analysis of the intercepts is. Convenient for them, but questionable at best.)<p>The operations themselves, however, are frequently in much murkier territory; sometimes without any oversight or accountability at all, and a good number are conveniently obscured; from internal and external oversight, and even from Government Cabinet ministers such as Ms May, because it&#x27;s too sensitive! Doesn&#x27;t matter if you&#x27;re TOP SECRET//STRAP1 or how many orange and purple forms you wave around, unless you&#x27;re actively part of the individual SCI compartment in question, you&#x27;re probably not even aware it exists, except maybe by a vague probably-two-word cover name (which is <i>supposed</i> to be arbitrary, but the newer guard loves their cute buzzwords too much). This is long-standing, if low-key, practice, spanning multiple governments - infrastructure and inertia outlasts governments which come and go, after all. Indeed, that was the entire basis under which the &quot;Mastering The Internet&quot; initiative was able to be set up in the first place; to my own knowledge this broad, general doctrine actually dates back a longer way in GCHQ than NSA, at least to the early 80s and the SystemX exchange intercept circuits. (It stands in stark contrast to their search policies, which they&#x27;re obviously much happier to parade around before oversight.)<p>Can she honestly say that she knew of the actual <i>modus operandi</i> of, for example, the infamous OPTIC NERVE database - a very large collected archived corpus of images (quite a number of them explicit, as you&#x27;d expect from a huge recorded cache of intimate conversations the participants believed private) collected via mass passive interception of Yahoo! webcam chats of <i>all</i> user streams transiting the interception points - and believed <i>that</i> was a lawful, necessary and proportionate infringement of human rights justifying a warrant?! (If she could, I doubt she&#x27;d want to.) Who did? Probably no-one. Sir Anthony May: Did you see that? No, I thought not. It seems plainly wrong to me, as obvious an unjustifiable operation as one could be, to no actual useful intelligence purpose, and a clear sign that the boys from Cheltenham had indeed gone rogue - and one entirely unreported, until Snowden.<p>Thanks, Snowden, Greenwald, the Guardian, Jacob, et al. Your work is incredibly valuable and you deserve those awards. Now maybe we can have a conversation about all of this - but such a conversation obviously can&#x27;t be effective when we&#x27;re still being so profoundly, patronisingly whitewashed.",1404348628

Taking someone from Penn Station to Grand Central Terminal is pure profit, because it&#x27;s fast and you&#x27;re guaranteed a fare once you get to Grand Central.  Taking someone from low-density area A to low-density area B is less profitable, so you don&#x27;t see many cabs in these low-density areas.<p>I see this in action all the time, because I tend to bike late at night when bars are closing and people need cabs.  If a cab does end up in Brooklyn, because they were required by law to take someone from Manhattan there, they tend to beeline it back to Manhattan, avoiding streets where they might encounter a fare.  Smith St. / Clinton St. is one pair like this.  Clinton St. is a residential street that leads to the Brooklyn Bridge.  Nobody naturally wants a cab there[1].  Smith St. is one street over going the same direction, and it&#x27;s all bars and restaurants.  It also leads directly to the Brooklyn Bridge (actually, the Manhattan Bridge; they&#x27;re very close).  But you see most cabs opting for Clinton instead of Smith, so they don&#x27;t get stuck picking up someone in Brooklyn that wants to go even deeper into Brooklyn.  Instead, they try to get back to the highly-profitable Manhattan as quickly as possible, even if it means going empty.<p>That&#x27;s not racism, that&#x27;s just the reality of how you make money as a cab driver.<p>(The cabs that can&#x27;t pick up passengers in Manhattan all take Smith St.)<p>[1] Except people like me that have noticed this pattern.

7980804,comment,7980617,7980617,2,0,s4sharpie,,,"Very interesting perspective on the value of a MBA: specifically as a path to be an entrepreneur.  Traditionally (say 20 years ago) much of the MBA was focussed on specific career paths: Investment Banking, Strategic Consulting, and Large Corporate Management Track.<p>I completed my MBA in 2006 while my school was shifting itself from the traditional aspects above to include a more entrepreneurial focus.  If you asked me at that stage for a budding tech entrepreneur is there value in an MBA, the answer would mirror the position of the writer.<p>However, some schools have made significant strides in developing their programs and themselves to support entrepreneurs (or people who want to pursue that pass).  I have been stunned in the way some schools now offer almost entire programs around entrepreneurship.  Is that enough to overcome the cost?<p>I don&#x27;t have an answer for that, but here are my thoughts:\n1. Many, if not all of these programs, now have incubators/competitions as a part of the program with significant seed funding available\n2.

She is not special snowflake and denying her entry is not a loss. The country will be fine without her.<p>2. Entry and right to work in US is privilege and not a right. I can stop inviting to my dinner party without any explanation and the same way US can deny you entry at any time unless you are citizen (and to lesser extent green card holder).<p>3. She was living dangerously. She spent last 7 years in and out of US on tourist visas. Officer was absolute right that she was abusing the system. US system is built on discretion. On B1/B2 visa at airport you are automatically granted right to live in US for six month but USCIS does not expect you to do it. Anything over one month is suspicious.<p>4. She applied for work visa but it did not get through. At that moment she looses key assumption for B1/B2 visa - she has no intention to live in US. The moment she applied for work visa she manifested desire to live in US which means that could not be granted B1/B2.<p>5. Social entrepreneur and organizing hackathons sounds like work. You could not work on visitor visa.<p>6. Where did she get money to live in US for 7 years? This is legitimate question if she lived on visitor visa.<p>PS.

7980738,comment,7973178,7978252,1,0,danbruc,,,"You are confusing and mixing up a lot of things. Let me start with mathematics. Mathematics is a very special case and very different from other sciences. It is completely made up by humans and has nothing to do with our world. We use mathematics in other sciences to describe our world but on its own mathematics has nothing to say about our world. You are also kind of misinterpreting Gödel&#x27;s incompleteness theorems. The first incompleteness theorem states that a system of axioms is either inconsistent or there are true statements that can not be proved from the axioms. Intuitively - but probably wrong in a strict sense - one could say that the number of true statements is just larger than the number of proofs, see Cantor&#x27;s diagonal argument. The second incompleteness theorem states the consistency of a system of axioms is one of the statements you can not prove by the system of axioms itself. But while you can not prove the consistency of a system within itself you can use a different system and so for example Gentzen&#x27;s consistency proof proves the consistency of first order arithmetics within primitive recursive arithmetics. I also don&#x27;t understand why you think of the axiom of choice as a debacle. The axiom of choice is independent of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory and it is up to you whether you want to accept and use it as an axiom or not. And also Russell&#x27;s paradox has been resolved long ago when mathematicians realized that not all collections of objects are sets.<p>Verifiability in the context of science means you can reproduce and verify results, i.e. when your quantum physics book says that electrons hitting a barrier with two slits will cause an interference pattern on a screen you can just do the experiment yourself and verify that it is true what your book says, no need to blindly believe anything, at least in principle. As far as I can tell religions lack this property.<p>You are also confusing natural sciences like physics and engineering disciplines like architecture. In physics a theory gets replaced by a new theory when discrepancies between theory and reality are found - Newtonian gravity does not exactly explain all gravitational phenomena and therefore got replaced by the general theory of relativity. Engineering disciplines on the other hand are not concerned with understanding the world and just use whatever fits their needs - why use the complex theory of general relativity to construct a building when Newtonian gravity is a simple and good enough approximation? By the way, black body radiation lead to the quantization of light, not to the special or general theory of relativity and there are a few more misconceptions in there but I will not go into them.<p>Predictibility means that a new theory predicts something nobody has observed before and you can look for it. If you actually find, it is a strong hint that the theory might be up to something. In 1928 Paul Dirac formulated a relativistic quantum theory for the electron and realized that this theory predicted an antiparticle, the positron, and four years later it was actually discovered. In 1916 Einstein completed the general theory of relativity and predicted the deflection of light by heavy masses, in 1919 this deflection was observed during a solar eclipse. Sitter precession and Lense–Thirring precession were predicted in 1918 but it took until 2004 that we were able to build Gravity Probe B and launch it into space to test the prediction. The Higgs particle was also predicted 50 years before it was discovered in 2013. Again as far as I can tell religions lack this property and your examples don&#x27;t really fit into this category.<p>(I will answer to the remaining points tomorrow but right now I am running out of time.)",1404347478

7980701,comment,7979270,7979270,1,0,anigbrowl,,,"<i>We have no plans to appeal their decision. It looks to be an arduous legal battle we cannot afford.</i><p>This is rather sad, and since you were given a 30-day window to contest the decision that was issued on May 22 and it&#x27;s now July, I have to assume that you decided not to bother and let the window close rather than asking for an extension or suchlike. But I&#x27;ll address the substantial question anyway.<p>Maybe you (ie Yorba) shouldn&#x27;t look at it in confrontational terms. My understanding is that the IRS has standards which it is required to meet by law before granting 501(c)(3) status, not least because of questionable compliance by other organizations in the past, eg the kerfuffle over Acorn, an organization whose lax internal standards led to an unusual Congressional defunding. (Of course that was a heavily politicized case, but that&#x27;s life inside the sausage factory).<p>If you look at it from the IRS&#x27;s point of view, much of the letter explains what sort of materials they need to satisfy the showing of a charitable purpose, eg on page 2 they point out that you have no real idea if the Tools are actually used by the poor and underprivileged. Obviously you don&#x27;t want to make everyone jump through hoops to download them, or track everyone who does, but you could solicit testimonials from under-privileged people who derive benefit from them, in order to make a showing of having provided aid to the underprivileged. Merely stating this as your goal doesn&#x27;t qualify, since such statements of good intention are easily employed by people who wish to maintain a charitable front for activities that would otherwise be taxable. <i>In the absence of any showing to the contrary</i> the IRS has to weigh the possibility of an illegitimate purpose. If not, they&#x27;re arguably just rubber-stamping the application.<p>We might think the charitable nature of an open-source project is self-evident, but the whole point of regulatory oversight is that you <i>can&#x27;t</i> always take people&#x27;s word at face value, because a substantial proportion of people are in fact dishonest and inclined to abuse loopholes in things like tax liability. So you need to provide them with some objective evidence of your charitable endeavor by showing examples of who is helped and how. Doing so would probably obviate the requirement to screen out commercial or political uses.<p>Likewise, the letter points out that the although you offer educational materials in the form of documentation (presumably of both the code and applications), you didn&#x27;t include any of this with your submission, so again you can&#x27;t really blame them for not giving weight to it. Yes, they could go off and look it up, but the fact is that in our adversarial legal system its up to the petitioner (for tax exempt-status) to proactively supply evidence for their claim and make an argument for how it supports their charitable activity, not that of the administrator to go and look for it. Some of the documentation of your site is quite good (eg the Shotwell architectural documentation for programmers), some is pretty perfunctory (eg the Shotweel user documentation, or the almost-non-existent documentation for the deprectated Fillmore project). By &#x27;perfunctory&#x27; I mean that the Shotwell documentation (for example) says &#x27;function x is here, configurator Y is there, common task Z can be achieved like so.&#x27; This is OK for hackers - let&#x27;s face it, many of use care as little to read documentation as programmers care to write it - but it&#x27;s not instructional in the sense of helping someone who was unfamiliar with computers to develop a skill they would otherwise lack.<p>I could go on, but I don&#x27;t want to go through the letter right now with a fine-tooth comb. The thing is, when I read it I see them telling you what they need to see and how it should be presented, as well as where the errors in your original submission were. Even if you don&#x27;t appeal, this is useful information for other open-source nonprofits to use - not just in meeting IRS compliance requirements, but in ensuring that their offerings provide concrete benefits beyond free-as-in-beer software. I don&#x27;t think the reference to notions of public works extending back 4 centuries is evidence of an antipathy to software or a requirement that the people of the 17th century have foresight of such things, but addresses the underlying notion of what constitutes charitable assistance: it is more than just putting a box on the sidewalk labeled &#x27;free stuff&#x27;.<p>One thing that jumps out at me from page 9 is the tricky issue of copyright assignment in free software licenses. I&#x27;ve always felt that GNU license tried to have its legal cake and eat it by saying it was open to all but preventing its use in closed-source commercial products (GPL 5c - <a href=""http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html</a>). It appears the IRS is saying that if you really want to &#x27;give&#x27; software/source to the public, you have to actually put it in the public domain rather than promulgating ideological restrictions; if someone then exploits it to make and sell &#x27;Closed Source Nastyware, Ripoff Edition&#x27; that&#x27;s just too bad.",1404346930

A Go library will work in a Go process (due to the need for (shared) GC in the runtime, among other things), whereas a Rust library that avoids GC (which is idiomatic Rust) will (I think!) be able to expose an interface akin to a C library (similar calling conventions, internal data type layout like C, etc), making it usable from practically <i>any</i> language with C-FFI.<p>Personally, this is one of the things I look forward to the most. We can create drop-in replacements for C libraries, creating a safer (but just as fast) world one library at a time. And if so desired, all the functionality will be available to anything that can interface with C. Even Go. Your Go libs are stuck in Go&#x27;s universe. Your Rust libs can be made available to anything that can bind to C.<p>Go eats the C/C++/Python/Ruby cake from the top, but it just can&#x27;t go all the way to the bottom. Rust can eat the cake from the very bottom (bare metal/kernelspace and up), but just like Go, the sky&#x27;s the limit - and for many reasons, like e.g. even better constraints on shared data than Go has, I personally believe it will go even &quot;higher&quot;.<p>My two cents.

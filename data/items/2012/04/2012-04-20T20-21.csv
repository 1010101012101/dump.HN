The drawing apps (particularly Paper) are excellent examples: they dictate their function in an elegant and subtle way. Paper is clearly for jotting down and collecting your thoughts. Brushes is clearly for more intense, focused illustration/mind mapping sessions.<p>The example that wanders into dangerous territory, though, is the desktop version of Photo Booth. While all the others I've mentioned serve to suggest what the app <i>can do</i>, Photo Booth's gaudy curtains-and-wood-paneling design dictates what you <i>should do</i>. It limits the range of the software's potential uses; the old grey photo booth was clearly a program for taking photos of anything you wanted with your front camera, while the new version is more apparently only for dicking around with your friends and taking silly distorted pictures. The skeumorphism of Paper serves to make the app more intuitive; the skeumorphism of Photo Booth serves only to constrict.",1334955488

Most of that value just happens to be through app updates and new apps, not OS updates.<p>To muddy the waters even further, some of the apps that Google updates (e.g. Market/Play Store, Music, Maps, etc.) are treated as part of the OS on the iOS side of the fence. Moreover, Google, quite understandably, is moving even further in that direction (e.g. Chrome Beta shows even browser updates moving outside of the core OS).<p>I'll separately add that once you go outside of what Apple considers the OS, they actually do a relatively poor job of supporting older devices with their new apps (e.g. Siri, iPhoto, iMovie, etc.) compared to Google.

A successful startup is already statistically improbable, so I don't think you can easily say that if Paypal had hired more jocks instead of nerds, it would have done even better.<p>So we have to look at this from first principles. When you have a less diverse team, you don't just have short-term communications latency. You also have the advantage that really similar people can push each other more, because it's easier to tell if you're doing 1% better than someone else if you're both doing the same thing.<p>I don't know how valuable ""tolerance"" is. That depends on what you're tolerating. If diversity trains your ability to ""tolerate,"" it sounds like a bad thing, the way having a broken air conditioner teaches you to tolerate heat. The belief that it creates broader understanding is also up for debate--in my experience, people express a wider range of thoughts in a more homogeneous environment, because they're less worried about offending people.<p>One last thing: ""its arrogance is not excused by success.""

Please do look into this one, the difference is not small.  I first encountered the differential timing issue with a test of the benefits of adding a phone touch point on top of an email cycle.  That extra contact moved conversions up by weeks.  So after the first month it looked fantastic, but then slowly degraded over time.  (There was improvement, but not enough to justify the expense.)  A careful cohort analysis showed that it was not worthwhile at a point where a naive A/B test was still showing the extra touchpoint winning by a very significant margin.<p>3. That's reasonable.<p>4.

Do we have to wait 200 years to see fights with ISIS in a similar &quot;noble tragedy&quot; kind of light, where there are no clear baddies and nobody&#x27;s assigned blame for the killings?<p>Maybe some of those dead people were &quot;baddies&quot; fighting for something we don&#x27;t believe in anymore? In that case, surely we should be celebrating the fact that they died. If not, then maybe we should be complaining about the violent people who killed them?

9764034,comment,9760164,9762093,0,0,wglb,,,"You see, this is a much older discussion than most folks think.  Back in the 70s, there was a lot of talk then about how badly software was built. &quot;If buildings were built the way software is built, the first strong wind would destroy civilization&quot;.  Remedies were proposed, dogmas (er, sorry, methodologies) developed, proselytized, replaced. Languages came and went. Howling winds came (see the &quot;voodoo gods&quot; in Count Zero) when we connected this all to the internet. Y2K came and showed some of the underbelly.<p>So, <i>tear it down and rebuild it securely</i> is actually many years to late 1998.<p>There are a few that know how to build software that isn&#x27;t swiss cheese. Just picking two that I know of, nobody reads the whole volume set (as noted in <i>Coders at Work</i>), and for the other one, nobody wants to use it because it isn&#x27;t under active development. The idea, even today, that a chunk of important internet software can actually be <i>finished</i> seems to be met with cognitive dissonance.<p>And there are organizations that know how to build very good software. But in todays fast moving businesses, who wants to be in a CMM 5 organization? Doesn&#x27;t sound like much fun to me, and probably not to you either.<p>My estimate of the last year that all of this could have been fixed was at least 30 years earlier than your estimate. Or sooner. I worked in an organization whose core software, running today, was first written about 50 years ago.",1435060665

OK, aren&#x27;t programming languages standard problem specification formats?  Why do you suppose there are different PLs?  Right, because all problems _can&#x27;t_ be specified advantageously in the same format.  Which brings you full circle to where you started.  That&#x27;s by no means a discouragement.

9763996,comment,9763227,9763903,0,0,briandear,,,"Really? Set the country back to the 1960s? You also actually think Bush is going to be the nominee? You don&#x27;t seem to know much about Republicans if you think that. As far as the 1960s goes, the economic picture was much better then than it has been over the past 8 years. The JFK tax cuts caused a decade of prosperity; the middle class was much stronger, wage growth was steady. What we have now is a generalized malaise. If you&#x27;re suggesting some kind of war on women malarcky, ask yourself why in Hilary&#x27;s State Department and in Obama&#x27;s White House do women still make 70% of what men make? These anti-republican memes are getting a bit stupid. Remember Hilary supported the Iraq War, the Libyan War (which did not even get Congressional approval as was required under the War Powers Act.) Hilary also strongly supports and supported the Patriot Act and warrantless NSA surveillance of Americans. Her only accomplishments as Secretary of State were aggrevation of Russian relations, the loss of American allies Libya and Egypt to Muslim extremists, more nonsense in Syria as well as facilitating the failure of Iran&#x27;s Green Revoluion. She and Obama also a let the Pakistani doctor who provided the Bin Laden tip to be captured, imprissoned and tortured by the Pakistanis as a reward for his helping the U.S.  She also racked up a lot of frequent flyer miles. The woman has zero accomplishments, either for woman or anyone else. She has never worked as a chief executive of anything, she has barely ever had a real job; she&#x27;s a lifetime political hack and the U.S. is worse for having her in the national dialog. Remember it was Rand Paul that fought the NSA and Rand Paul that has promoted the end of civil asset forfeiture and he has also called for the ending of racist sentencing guidelines as wel as decriminalization of drugs. Hilary represents a totalitarian Democrat plantation owner. She&#x27;s a horrible choice for the school board, let alone President of the United States. She&#x27;s an evil snake and anyone who supports her is either mentally ill or profoundly ignorant or just brainwashed. If she cared about women she wouldn&#x27;t have defended a child rapist. She also wouldn&#x27;t have defended Bill Clinton amongst multiple credible allegations of rape, harassment and other misconduct. She also would have declared Boko Haram a terror group when she had the chance. I could go on for days; the point is that Hilary Clinton deserves to be in jail or scrubbing toilets in Siberia. I didn&#x27;t even touch upon the Clinton Foundation &quot;donations&quot; from foreign governments while she was Secratary of State. Or the email servers. Or the utter lack of transparency she has demonstrated over her long illustrious career as a leech suckling upon the blood of the American people. I&#x27;d vote for Sheila Jackson Lee or even Michael Jackson before I&#x27;d vote for Hilary.",1435060188

Furthermore, radios are the most power hungry components after the screen, another reason to try to avoid them.  Data connections are not truly ubiquitous either, so what do you do when you don&#x27;t have a connection?  Lastly, from a data security point of view, if you don&#x27;t want to hand all of your <i>unencrypted</i> data to a 3rd party, you would have to host the server yourself (in this model the server needs to be able to manipulate your data, which means that it must be able to decrypt any encryption you had on the data connection itself).<p>So no, I don&#x27;t see that as ever being a desirable model for mobile computing.

Software being free can have a lot of indirect benefits to the user, but ultimately practical &quot;power&quot; is a function of what <i>you</i> can practically do with it, and that is very different from what the thing can theoretically do.<p>Apple probably has motives for the app store other than making user experiences simple. But, they also really have the goal (and the effect) of making the user experience easier, which puts more real power into real hands. If the below median user can install a photo sharing app to see her nieces photo collage, that&#x27;s real power in users hands.<p>Also, I think being strict and abstract about &quot;exclusively to advance the interests of its owner&quot; is losing a lot of important texture. First, very few technological benefits go exclusively to anyone. They go to users, vendors, various other users and vendors. A lot of them get released into the ether as externality vapors, like productivity or ideas for new technology.<p>The reality of the current state of computing is interesting, but it&#x27;s very hairy and hard to grasp and boil down to simple abstractions. When we use our phones, we are interacting with other people, generating data/content on other people&#x27;s phones, in various databases to the benefit of a bunch of people/companies. When you are using your navigation app, generating data about traffic, you are benefiting the app, other osiers. Possibly future users. Possibly that data will be sued in other ways. Maybe a construction company will buys it to plan new roads (and win a contract) which will benefit the city… Maybe someone&#x27;s girlfriend will one day have it beamed to her implant to estimate when Brian will arrive.<p>Is this bad because it&#x27;s not to the exclusive benefit of the user?

It&#x27;s a small, crowded station and in no way could cope with the added load.<p>Ten years ago there was a plan to rebuild it a massive new station along a whole block of the high street, but it had too much opposition.  The last I heard is that they are going forward with a plan that&#x27;s less disruptive at street-level.  No construction has started yet, so check back in a decade.",1435057629

Bitbucket then can turn that into a link to your JIRA project<p>All of the who/what/why is already in the JIRA ticket as more often than not there are non-coders who have input/insight around the issue.  When I am looking at the commit log I see a brief summary and if I need more details I can go to JIRA and get the full history with screenshots, designs, reproducible steps, business cases, etc.<p>Another side effect of this is, when someone is searching in JIRA and finds a ticket they can easily see all of the commits related to that ticket.  This also works with Github<p>The commit becomes simply the &quot;how&quot; &quot;JIRA-XXX brief desc&quot; was implemented",1435057461

There are useful psychological batteries for assessing the fit between fit/vocation that take such assessment far beyond navel-gazing/tea-leaf-reading.<p>Another approach would be to involve yourself with an organization (vocation or volunteer) with a project that appeals to your vision for a better world - and <i>discover</i> what roles beyond traditional mathematician you find you can make a contribution to.

Are you a b2b? b2c? media outlet? etc...<p>The question is, do you need Web Analytics to analyze your traffic (sources, exits, uniques, etc...), Customer Analytics to analyze your user base (unique customer identification, customer retention...), Mobile Analytics, Server Monitoring, Email Marketing Analytics etc...<p>Google Analytics can be the best free solution out there for general web analytics, it really covers everything you need to know about your ""visitors"" and it works really well with media outlets, blogs or websites where visitors don't identify themselves.<p>Woopra Customer Analytics (<a href=""http://www.woopra.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.woopra.com</a>) can be a great solution for you if your visitors identify themselves on your website. Woopra creates a profile for every single visitor on your website and aggregates visits across multiple devices (multiple cookies) under one profile when customers identify themselves. Which reduces the noise dramatically when you're doing reports on unique customers. Most people access your service across multiple devices (home, work, iPad, iPhone etc...) and you don't want to count every visitor multiple times in your reports.<p>Woopra also allows you to leverage your customer data for sales, marketing and support purposes as it builds a complete behavioral profile in real-time as they engage with your website.<p>My personal favorite Woopra feature is the ability to get push notifications whenever any visitor or identified customer fits in a certain category and/or commits one or more specific actions.<p>The other question you need to ask yourself is ""Who's going to be using the product?"". Products & Services are designed differently for Developers / Product Management, Marketers, Sales, Support...<p>To summarize: Web Analytics is a very generic term now and you're going to have to decide what fits better with your business:<p>A/B Testing:\n- Optimizely (Commercial)<p>Customer Analytics (SaaS):\n- Woopra (Commercial & Free)\n- KISSMetrics (Commercial)<p>Mobile Analytics:\n- MixPanel (Commercial & Free)\n- Flurry (Free)<p>News & Media Website Analytics:\n- Google Analytics (Free)\n- Chartbeat (Commercial)\n- Clicky (Free & Commercial)<p>Email Marketing Analytics:\n- Marketo (Commercial)\n- HubSpot (Commercial)<p>Server Monitoring:\n- WebMon (Commercial - recently launched)\n- NewRelic (Commercial)<p>(Disclosure: I'm founder & CEO of Woopra)",1351436146

4709059,story,,,2,0,UXweb,"A tool for testing a website in real time on multiple devices  Jolly app",,"Recently I discovered a tool which can be very useful for web development and testing: it's called Jolly and it's an app for Mac OSX. \nNormally the prototyping and front-end web-development process looks like that: you code, save your project, reload your browser, check how the website looks on different screens either by using a bookmarklet or by setting up a local server and opening the website on other devices. Then you code again, save, reload, save, reload and so on. This can get cumbersome with multiple browsers and multiple devices. What if you need to test your design on an iPad, an iPhone, an Android phone, an Android tablet, a Windows phone and so on? This is especially important for cross-browser testing and testing responsive designs simultaneously on multiple devices.  \nJolly solves this problem by delivering the changes simultaneosly and accross multiple devices. Define the project folder for Jolly to observe, open the generated link on all the browsers and devices (in the same wireless network) and see your changes flow automatically while you code.. Jolly performs its work independently. You are free to choose whatever development or design tool you like. Jolly will reload your project as soon as it detects a change in the project folder you specified.  \nIt's even possible to ""wiretrap"" your prefered server technology.  \nHere is the video showing what Jolly does: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Onqtpqvd7w\nJolly is available in the Mac App Store: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/jolly/id567804958?ls=1&mt=12",1351436116

Emerging economies like China will eat this up to solve their traffic congestion problems in big cities, and are totalitarian enough to mandate it. Once it becomes a huge economic advantage, the other economies will have to follow just to keep up. Governments are lazy, they will want to push more traffic into their road systems at less cost because you hate traffic and taxes!<p>Hybrid solutions are also possible: there will be certain roads (controlled access interstates) where driverless is mandatory while certain streets where driver intervention is required. You still get most of the traffic optimization benefits if the driverless roads are congestion bottlenecks. However, the real benefit doesn't come until we have driverless cities, where people don't need to own cars and a roaming fleet of autonomous vehicles serve as pervasive taxis. You could even get rid of parking lots!<p>The system can easily trace what cars are bad actors and adapt accordingly (shut down traffic in a region with a bad actor until police arrive).",1351435982

Color is just another axis along which information can be communicated to you, one similar to using bold fonts to indicate ""this is a keyword"" (which many textbooks do) or italics to mean ""this is important"" (which many articles do) or different fonts to indicate ""this was block quoted from a typed document"" (which many books do). It would actually be kind of interesting to set off proper nouns in a special color (and in fact some languages do this, both human and machine, using capitalized first letters), or to highlight pronouns in colors that matched their references (to make random access scanning in fiction books faster and easier). If the colors aren't working for you, you might want to figure out how color could be better applied to your problem, but throwing it out entirely is just having fun accepting and working around the challenge of a handicap: next you might try removing language features such as ""classes"" or even ""functions/procedures"" from your experience, as ""real programmers"" do not need these distractions and without them you will probably spend more time paying close attention to your control flow. (In fact, while that sounds silly, spending a few months coding in nothing but assembly language is actually quite mind-opening.) (Also, FWIW, Rob Pike--the inspiration for this article--actually makes arguments similar to this for why Go is a great language: that by having fewer features, people will make less mistakes... very similar to the reasons why people designed Java as limiting as it is, and why thousands of developers insist on using C instead of C++ or assembly instead of C.)

Considering there are 3 gaming consoles (that are cheaper than PCs) vying for that other 50 percent, it appears that PC sales are increasing not decreasing.<p>Another factor to consider is that PCs do not require replacing as often as they did in previous generations.  The article makes no mention of these factors.<p>The death of the PC has been greatly exaggerated, mostly by those with investments in consoles, tablets, and phones.

It's free, it will do your sites, apps, and real-time stuff if you need it, your colleagues are likely to be familiar with it already, and it can cover A/B testing relatively easily.<p>When you find yourself saying things like ""I wish Google Analytics had XYZ feature"" or ""GA isn't compatible with ABC thing we love"" then you'll have a checklist for finding something more appropriate to your needs.<p>Otherwise, use the tools that come for free with services like Facebook and MailChimp!

The police will need ways to override driverless vehicles to keep up with criminals.<p>Moreover, many individuals who love driving their sports cars don't want driverless vehicles; many law-abiding car hackers and tinkerers don't want to relinquish full control over their vehicles; and civil-rights organizations will likely end up fighting driverless vehicles in the courts.<p>Instead of an Utopian, smoothly-working, accident-free system that doesn't need police, seat belts, or insurance, I would expect our road-traffic system to evolve into a <i>more complex mix</i> of driverless and driver-controlled vehicles.

I work at a place that has gone down this path and there are a lot of pitfalls.<p>If you go with something like Mixpanel, then that software does what it does. If somebody wants to measure something that Mixpanel can't, they either have to go without or make a really good case for getting their desired figures some other way at huge cost.<p>Not so with in-house solutions. Because it's <i>possible</i> to constantly measure more things by investing programmer time, that's what happens. Be it product, marketing or finance, somebody always has another bright idea or another ""I absolutely cannot do my job any more without this"" measuring need.<p>Because this pressure to add features comes from within, rather than from outsiders, it's hard to resist. People will push you to ship ""just this one thing"" outside of the normal release cycle because it's always ""so urgent"". This happens to me several times every sprint because of our internal analytics software, and it's an enormous time sink when every ""just this one quick thing"" needs to be pushed through the QA and release process one by one.<p>Also, people are happier to put their faith into external products. If RJMetrics reports a higher-than-expected number of occurrences of event P, you assume RJMetrics is working correctly and the first question is ""What bug in our system is causing too many of these events to happen?"". If the internal analytics system says the same thing, it's an analytics bug until proven otherwise. As the maintainer of the analytics system, this gives me de facto responsibility for identifying and triaging the whole team's bugs.",1351433339

4708942,comment,4708701,4708701,1,0,marshallp,,,"Everyone's missing that drones (flying cars) might take off too at roughly the same time. The challenge of making driverless cars completely safe (intelligent sensing and control) is also the challenge for flying cars. Flying cars would beat out road cars and so the reenvisioning of society is greater than what people like Brad Templeton have done. With flying cars, all investments in roads become useless and huge swathes of land become inhabitable. Real estate prices should consequently plummet and a worldwide financial panic occurs (this can all happen within 5 years). However, this will be a good thing since it will clean the current mess of unproductive activity that is land owning and leasing.<p>What the mainstream media also aren't realizing is that the technology for driverless cars is also the same technology that automates away most factory/farming/mining/retail/distribution jobs. The effect in the west might not be so large, but in the rest of the world it could be devastating, leading to riots and civil wars.",1351433226

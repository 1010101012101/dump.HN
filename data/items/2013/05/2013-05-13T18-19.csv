5700658,comment,5698510,5700413,3,0,will_brown,,,">That sounds an awful lot like ""it is a crime to illegally enter the country""<p>I think your position is shared by many if not most, but that does not make it a crime, it just encourages and justifies treating undocumented immigrants as criminals.  For example the wikipedia article you cite, cites section a.) of 8 USC  1325 - Improper entry by alien, but if you actually read the code it continues to section b.) it continues...Any alien who is apprehended while entering (or attempting to enter) the United States at a time or place other than as designated by immigration officers shall be subject to a <i>civil penalty</i> of  (see: <a href=""http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1325"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1325</a>)<p>>Immigration is not criminalized; illegal immigration is<p>It is not criminal.  It is civil in nature, just like a speeding ticket is not criminal it is civil but results in fines.  The imprisonment is a little misleading, because undocumented, or even documented, immigrants facing removal proceedings (deportation for the layman) can be held in ""detention centers"" during the proceedings, so while in fact they are similar to jails or prisons, legally they are not.  I have even had cases where my client was staying at a hotel (paid by the government) during the removal proceeding bc the detention center had no more open beds.  The reality is many immigrants are eligible to ""elect voluntary removal"" if they can purchase their own travel out of the country and generally the Government agrees and allows them to voluntarily depart without having to go through the proceedings/detention.<p>>""Criminal"", the noun, is defined as ""A person who is guilty of a crime, notably breaking the law.""<p>The key is guilty of a crime, but immigration status is not a crime it is a civil issue.",1368471413

The talk is really good, but I could never make this read smoothly.<p>Fortunately I think the content is excellent and that will hopefully save the day.<p>My take is along the lines of the earlier embedded systems comment. This is the sort of thing you would have done in a real-time OS snagging packets directly in an ISR and queuing them to a task for later processing. The processor and memory suggestions are just common practice in that arena.<p>But that kind of sucks for numerous reasons.

Stop selling that entirely. Discontinue it; put the existing triple play customers on the new triple play (which so happens to have the same price, just with more allocated to the connection itself), stop offering that tier to existing internet-only customers as soon as their contracts expire. Your new alternative is a) a very slow connection (not fast enough for Netflix/Hulu/whatever) for $29/month, b) a 100Mbps+ connection for $99/month, or c) a ""triple play"" 100Mbps+ connection + basic cable + phone for $110/month, and whatever premium channels you want on top of that for exactly what the channel itself charges for its content. Or you can get phone from Skype and TV from Hulu and Verizon couldn't care less, because they're not in the content business, they're in the wire business -- they should <i>want</i> you to stop subscribing to their over the top offerings and switch to third party services, because that's not where the money is.<p>Compare the revenues or market cap of Skype or Hulu to that of Verizon FiOS, and then realize that both Skype and Hulu have more customers than FiOS, and ask yourself which business you'd rather be in. Infrastructure operators selling over the top services is just an invitation for them to interfere with competitors -- let the over the top market be competitive (and therefore have very small margins) and take the margins from the infrastructure where you can hold on to them. Look up ""one monopoly rent"" theory. If they're going to have a monopoly and collect monopoly rents, just let them do it in the monopoly market and not have to lose the benefits of competition in the over the top market merely in order to claim the same overall margins spread out over more products.

But writing your own userspace driver from scratch is actually very simple -- I've done it for Intel's 1Gbps and 10Gbps cards before the DPDK was made publicly available. We're talking ~1000 lines of user-space code, and less than a month of work. Writing your own userspace networking stack is of course more complicated, depending on exactly which level of protocol support you need. Supporting say ARP or EtherChannel is trivial, while a production quality and interoperable TCP stack will be man-years of work.<p>But having written systems doing 10M TCP connections at 10Gbps, I strongly believe that you want to relegate the kernel into the role of a management system. Having the system split across the kernel and user-space will lead to unacceptable performance, pretty much no matter where you split things. And having the full application in the kernel would be a nightmare for development, debugging, and deployment.

The reality is that we sometimes come in late on delivery but in the end our clients like us, stick with us and refer us because they like our work and the end-product is good.<p>Two points I would add to the discussion are:<p>1) that in addition, or in lieu of raising rates consider lengthening the project time-line. You can often push a project out further in time which both softens the expectations and gives you more time to deliver quality and deal with more iterations.<p>2) to take the time to feel out the client. If you are really in demand and becoming overbooked the LAST thing you want is a terrible client who can potential swamp your resources. Work only with people who will respect you and your team and never settle on this even if it means you can make more money.

is great stuff, far beyond what
you described, that I largely
borrowed from the past 100 years
of engineering and technology history.<p>The bottom line points are:  Getting
through step (4) is comparatively cheap,
when can do it.  So, didn't spend
much money.  Then in step (5) get
to deploy a solution that has 
high promise of big financial gains
with low risk.  That's not good
news?<p>The 'secret' is that by the time
get through step (4), really have
something valuable.  So, well before
launch or traction, are quite 
confident will get major success.
That's big, huge stuff.<p>There are many examples from the
past 100 years.  Now, note,
that after step (1), steps
(2)-(4) are just technical.
So, we want to know if my claims
for those steps are supported
by history.  Well, for an example, at one time
the US wanted to do photo reconnaissance
of the USSR.  We tried the U-2,
but it flew too low and too slow
and got shot down.  So, Kelly 
Johnson proposed an airplane
that would fly at Mach 3+,
at 80,000+ feet, for 2000+
miles without refueling, be
relatively difficult to see
on radar, and not get shot down.
His design and proposal were
essentially just on paper.
The project was approved, and
he delivered as promised.  So,
the lesson is, really can remove
nearly all the technology risk
just by work on paper.<p>Then with the 'big' problem as
in my step (1) and solid technical
work in my steps (2)-(4), enter
step (5) in really good shape.
This is good news.
Sorry you don't see this.<p>If you want to insist, just insist,
against all evidence keep just
insisting that the usual 
wildly unpredictable, super
high risk work of Silicon
Valley venture funded information
technology startups is just 
the best possible with all the

Some of them are used in the software industry and some are not. There are many claims about many languages: language x is good because [insert some random ramblings], language y is good because [...]
However, no language is adopted by the industry solely based on claims (and btw. I have seen some utterly ridiculous claims made by those who try to promote Haskell.) Every once in a while, some companies try out new languages.  
Very few such languages get adopted and as you can see functional languages are almost completely absent from the industry. And there's a very good reason for it: they're simply not suitable for producing professional grade commercial software. If it had been otherwise, someone would have figured it out. The funny thing is that the start-ups that try to use them (usually founded by FP advocates themselves) also fail one after another. But some people never learn. Furthermore, many companies forbid the use of functional style or characteristics implemented in certain imperative languages. The code of good, proper lanaguages for general purpose software engineering, is almost self describing! What is unclear should be sorted out quite easily using the documentation.<p>Those ""professionals who actually know what they are doing"" don't seem to exist when it comes to functional languages. The evidence is the very fact there's not a single piece of important commercial software written in such a language.
The question is rather: can such specialists exist? Because I'm afraid they can't exist because the functional approach is fundamentally wrong.<p>Examples of ambiguity in FP?

I'm using email sync as the example here, but the benefits would really come from a universal (or more universal than today) sync, not just an easy email sync.<p>I just think Drive would be a great way to unify backup methods across the Data Liberation options. Gmail backup is already relatively easy, but some of the others are less so, and being able to turn them all on with a few clicks (rather than remembering to visit the web interface and exporting every few weeks) would seem to be a better solution. Ideally IMAP support would continue, and, even more ideally, the hypothetical Drive backup format for a gmail account would be some typical email client save format for IMAP accounts so you could (at least somewhat) transparently open the backup in a major email client.<p>All of this is certainly not trivial, and less so now that I thought through the above. If you treat the local ""backup"" as a first-class version of your mail by actually opening it in a client and then altering emails in there, drive could then in theory sync it back with the gmail account just with IMAP.<p>Some account data you'd probably have to specify is a read-only backup and not as read/write. For instance, exporting your Reader data gives you a whole json format export, as does exporting your g+ data, and I'm sure other products as well. I'd imagine it wouldn't be worth the extra engineering effort (and possibly a recipe for disaster) to support random changes to that json being synced back up to the cloud (if it was even data you had permissions to change in the first place...for instance, if you edited the text of a post you commented on, but it wasn't your post).<p>You could probably get around those by just explicitly labeling the subfolders as ""Google+ backup"" or something, so there's no expectation of changes there being synced back to your account. Should it overwrite any changes you made locally next time it syncs, though?<p>Luckily I don't have to figure those things out. Still a good idea though :)",1368469226

Patents aren't a full license that controls every aspect of the owners use of an object, it just prevents copying. Well, ok, what if typical use of the object makes a new copy?<p>Here, the patented object is a seed, where its main inherent function is self-duplication. You could use it for other things, as filler for bean bag chairs, as fuel for a massive fire, as feed, whatever. But the main thing seeds do is reproduce themselves.<p>So does the exhaustion doctrine apply?<p>No. The patent system is mainly a DO NOT COPY law. It's not mainly a USE THINGS YOU OWN law. The exhaustion doctrine is an artifact, a patch, to keep DO NOT COPY from getting out of hand.<p>It should surprise no one what when asked if the DO NOT COPY law means DO NOT COPY, that SCOTUS should reply, ""Why, yes, it means exactly that.""<p>I'm not a huge fan of the way Monsanto has aggressively leveraged bio patents against some farmers. Hell, I'm skeptical of the economic utility of state granted monopolies in general. But this case was never realistically addressing any of that. We had a knowing infringer, so none of the most abusive practices. The broader bio patent theories are very well established.

The line of argument used is extraordinarily tenuous: first it argues that reaction time is a good proxy for intelligence, then it collects different reaction-time studies, weights them by sample size, and computes a correlation. Unfortunately, if you look at the main graph of the paper, it looks like a trend-line drawn through noise. But! Because of the sample-size weighting, the data is dominated by a single study in 1889, which had 3410 participants (the largest out of 16) and an unusually fast reaction time (the fastest). They then use frequentist statistics to sneak in the assumption that reaction time varies only with different subjects and populations, and not with different test-apparatus and methodology, arriving at a ""significant at p=.003"" result which I have no confidence in.",1368469160

2. Put up picture-based landing pages on those domains. The user only really sees pictures.
3. Put up or spin content with relevant keywords, put it underneath the images. Google only sees a couple pictures (it doesn't know what they are) and a bunch of really relevant content.
4. Build a shiz-ton of links. This is where black hatters really make their money. I usually build about 125,000 links/day from completely legit sites, and to Google it pretty much looks like it's going viral. If you know where to get the links, know how to generate the content, and can make them seem human, Google has a really hard time finding you.
5. Link the landing pages to your money site using affiliate links.
6. Wait until your site gets manually reviewed and pulled down.<p>So any somewhat decent black-hatter will have hundreds of sites in the works at any given time. The worry of taking a site down isn't a big one, even though if you take down one site a black-hatter's traffic could drop 3,000 visits/day. The sites I work on usually remain up for an average of 6 months at a time, and the only way for them to be caught is a manual review. Some only stay up for a couple weeks, but some stay up for years. There have been times when landing pages are getting a couple thousand visits a day but I haven't had time to go back through and redirect the traffic to the money site or update them from the generic landing page.<p>Since all of the actions taken mimic closely enough what humans would do, it's really difficult to be caught by webspam teams.",1368468877

What you've written is pretty much the same as any other 'blame the victim' excuse out there. Disney is the one in the position of power in this relationship (financing). The creator had the intention to create a non-stereotyped princess character. She created it, Pixar and Disney produced, released and marketed the movie. That character was highly praised in critiques, and now Disney has changed the character. She is now responding to their actions, as is her right,",1368468074

Monsanto did, indeed, sue him for patent infringement, not breach of contract. The contract mentioned in the case is just his license to grow the plants from Monsanto. He was forbidden from replanting those soybeans (or other patented soybeans) by patent law because such actions exceeded the scope of his license. There is nothing at all in the opinion that refers to a contract where he agreed only to buy RR soybeans from Monsanto.",1368468031

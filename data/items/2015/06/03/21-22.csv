I mean that it&#x27;s unsatisfying in a theoretical sense (because it gives me no theoretical feeling for the Turing-machine-to-differential-equation transformation), but, if I really wanted to be picky, I could point out that (a) nothing in the definition of a Turing machine guarantees its physical realisability (what if its number of states is bigger than the power set of the number of elementary particles in the universe, or, similarly, if it writes on an unbounded amount of tape?), and (b) Newton&#x27;s equations of motion are only approximations to, not exact descriptions of, the physical universe.<p>Is there any more-or-less explicit recipe that says &quot;given a description of a Turing machine (as a 7-tuple, say <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine#Formal_definition"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine#Formal_definiti...</a>), here is a (possibly unmanageably huge) differential equation such that …&quot;—well, I don&#x27;t even really know what.  Your answer suggests that I might ask that, say, the solution $y$ to the differential equation where $y(1)$ somehow encodes a given initial state of the tape is such that $y(0)$ somehow encodes the final state of the tape (with the understanding that $y$ is not defined at $0$ if the machine doesn&#x27;t halt on the corresponding input).",1433368550

9656153,comment,9654042,9655405,0,0,rcthompson,,,"Rephrasing &quot;95% probability of correctness&quot; as &quot;5% chance of bullshit&quot; is perfectly fine, and a good way to look at things. The problem is that &quot;p = 0.05&quot; doesn&#x27;t mean either of those things, or even anything close to either of those things. P-values are always taking about a null hypothesis, and <i>only</i> the null hypothesis. The p-value answers &quot;How rare would this result be if the null hypothesis is true?&quot; Note that the alternative hypothesis, which is what you really want to know about, never even enters the question. This is why people have such issues with p-values. People want to know about the alternative hypothesis, and they want to believe that the statistical tool they&#x27;re using is answering their question, but a p-value is answering a different question entirely.<p>It&#x27;s intuitively obvious that a result that is unlikely under the null hypothesis constitutes some evidence in favor of the alternative hypothesis, but the precise nature of that relationship depends on information that is not usually available, such as prior estimates of the likelihood that each model is true. If such information is available, you can use Bayesian statistics to answer the question that you really want to ask (e.g. &quot;What is the probability that the alternative hypothesis is true given this data?&quot;), instead of using p-values to answer the only question you are capable of answering, even though that answer isn&#x27;t a particularly useful one.<p>For a concrete example, xkcd comes to the rescue: <a href=""https://xkcd.com/882/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://xkcd.com/882/</a><p>Consider that, when testing the 20 flavors, you expect to get at least one p-value of 0.05 by random chance, since 0.05 = 1 in 20. So in this specific case there&#x27;s actually a very high probability (much higher than 5%, even higher than 50%) that the result is bullshit. But even when you&#x27;re doing a single test, not 20 of them, a p-value of 0.05 can still mean much higher than 5% of bullshit. Or it could be much lower.<p>Lastly, note that &quot;confidence intervals&quot; are just a statement of the thresholds for p-values. For example, the 95% confidence interval includes your null hypothesis if and only if your p-value is greater than 0.05. So everything I said above about p-values applies equally well to confidence intervals. In particular, &quot;95% confidence interval&quot; does NOT mean &quot;95% confidence that the value is within this interval&quot;.<p>If you want to ask me some more questions, email me at rct at thompsonclan dot org.",1433368531

Note that margins are on flow, where as ROC is on a fixed asset.  The idea is that if you know the margin and growth of a business, you can come up with a long term value estimate.  (If you&#x27;re interested, I can write more about how this calculation works)  It&#x27;s also worth noting that this isn&#x27;t the &quot;optimal&quot; way to make spending decisions.  Good companies know that it&#x27;s worth treating all expenses as a &quot;Return on Capital&quot; basis rather than purely optimizing on margins.  (This can be called EVA or Economic Value Added)<p>What the article captures is the essence of good leadership and management.  You can&#x27;t be 100% long term - investors would never know if the money is being well spent.  You can&#x27;t be 100% short term - you&#x27;ll never invest for the future, and will get crushed when the future arrives.<p>There is one caveat...  If a company decides that it can no longer innovate, then the &quot;Stop spending money, and return money to sharedholders via buybacks so that they can invest it elsewhere&quot; actually does make sense.

Designing components for the possibility that they&#x27;ll be used in a distributed context is just proper software engineering—it&#x27;s just thinking quantitatively about cohesion and coupling, really—and is to be expected of a proper software engineer.<p>...but that sounds crazy, right? I mean, we both know how hard it is to hire a proper distributed systems engineer. That&#x27;s the implicit complaint you&#x27;re making here.<p>Well, but wait—<i>why</i> is it hard? I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s an intrinsic thing. Distributed systems aren&#x27;t any more complicated than calculus or graph theory. It&#x27;s not like we couldn&#x27;t make the proper design of them a required course in colleges.<p>Thus, I would say it&#x27;s hard precisely <i>because</i> people (including curriculum planners) think that there are only the two alternatives: either up-front-designing a monolith with low operational costs and fast iteration, or up-front-designing a formation of distributed components with high operational costs and slow iteration. The second alternative is obviously bad anywhere but at scale, and we need very few engineers that can operate &quot;at scale&quot;, so it ends up not being seen as a required skill.<p>But, obviously, those aren&#x27;t the only two options! If you <i>have</i> the engineers with the skill to design distributed systems, and then have them start off your software design as a &quot;distributed system all in one process&quot;, then you get the best of both worlds: low operational overhead, fast iteration from the start (redrawing the service boundaries when you&#x27;re still at the experimentation phase will be painless as long as you use a framework/language/platform that abstracts away inter-service RPC), and a design that organically &quot;anneals into&quot; a proper set of services, instead of a big ball of circularly-dependent mud.<p>But, again, you need actually-competent engineers.",1433367905

This was and still is a perfectly legal loophole. There are no limits on cooperation with other intelligence agencies.   \nWhen 9/11 happened the NSA got effectively a blank cheque and asked to increase intelligence gathering significantly, so instead of continuing the GCHQ misdirection they simply expanded spying within the US and then legalised it (via executive order at the time, law later).<p>So the NSA was spying on Americans in the 1990s, they just had to do more legal maneuvering to do it. It just got significantly worse in the 2000s and they dropped even pretending that they weren&#x27;t. Even if a stronger law outlawed spying on Americans, you&#x27;d just see them go back to the GCHQ way.<p>PS - A lot of Americans seem to want the NSA spying on &quot;foreigners&quot; without realising that that effectively opens the door to the NSA spying on Americans.

Service discovery uses DNS so you don&#x27;t need to modify your application to take advantage of it.

Currently Google is forced to rip out Docker&#x27;s native networking stack because it is not flexible enough for their opinionated networking model. This causes many Docker applications to break in Kubernetes today. That problem should go away with Docker 1.7+ because Google-style networking can be expressed as a Docker plugin, which Kubernetes can load programmatically as part of its orchestration.

When a company does <i>not</i> have a shitty code base, it quickly throws all of its resources into improving the product and user experience for its customers, which increases its market share, revenue, and moat against competitors.  This continues until all the new complexity makes the code shitty again, where they stage a cleanup & architectural fixit to be able to make forward progress.  If the codebase is <i>not</i> shitty, it means that they&#x27;re leaving money on the table, and will continue to get shittier until code quality starts costing them money again.<p>Companies like Google, Microsoft, and Facebook actually do adopt (and often discover) many of the industry best practices.  Their codebase is still shitty; the reason is that any cleanliness and rationality in their architecture is quickly eaten up by new features and products that drive the industry forward.  As consumers, we see the benefits; as employees, we just muddle along as best as we can.<p>The only way to break this cycle is for engineers to pay companies instead of getting paid by them.  I don&#x27;t think this is what you had in mind.  (Although, some engineers do make this bargain.  This is why Haskell/Erlang/Ocaml/Lisp salaries are often lower than they would be for equivalently-skilled Java and C++ engineers: you take a pay cut to work in a language that&#x27;s actually enjoyable to program in.)<p>Barring that, the way out is to learn some negotiating skills and at least get paid for putting up with a sucky codebase.

Mine wasn&#x27;t quite &quot;A X B&quot;, though. I wonder if that makes a difference?<p>Mine was &quot;A X not-X B&quot;. I had a command line program that I could run and give two files, the reference file (typically a straight uncompressed rip from the CD) and a test file, typically an MP3 made from the reference file.<p>My program would then conduct a run of N trials. For each trial, it would assign the reference file as file A, the test file as file B, and it would randomly assign either the reference or test as file X. There were buttons I could press to listen to file A, file B, file X, or the file that was not file X. When I thought I had figured out whether X was A or B, I could signal my choice, and the next run would start. At the end, it would tell me how many I had gotten right.<p>To make sure I wasn&#x27;t picking up clues from any slight delay from increased overhead in starting playing an MP3 file compared to starting a wave file, the program tossed in a random delay before executing a play command.<p>If I were doing this again, I think I would also toss in some minor randomization of the volume level on playback.<p>Anyway, the results were about what I expected.

The golden koban coins (Ryo), as well as silver and brass coins, formed the official Edo period currency. However, the amount of gold used in minting koban declined over time, and there were also regional, unofficially minted koban, so it would have been relatively straightforward to try to create counterfeit koban. In addition, Spanish silver dollars were used unofficially, despite not being the official currency. The actual value of all these coins could fluctuate on a seasonal or even daily basis, and was tied into the price of rice. All of these are reasons to not deal with exchanging metals for daily transactions, hence the prevalence of credit-based transactions.",1433365633

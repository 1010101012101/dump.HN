I have released a few AS3 games using a loose common engine.  It was relatively painless to port from AS3 to pure JavaScript.  I think it's time to make the jump to porting it to Haxe to see if I'm ready to develop full-time in Haxe.",1357181972

5000829,comment,5000603,5000812,4,0,mikeryan,,,"So at least in the past when I worked for TechTV new networks paid for carriage, and eventually got paid by the cable operator once they earned their stripes (usually 3 to 5 years)<p>I doubt this cost is really the relevant one though. More importantly its the opportunity cost. Cable operators are limited in bandwidth and the number of channels they can carry at any given time. Getting rid of Ovation free's up that network bandwidth for another, more profitable network (or more HD channels etc...)<p>Ovation and Current both were at a disadvantage as independent networks. Larger network groups like NBCU, Scripps (food network) Viacom (Comedy Central & MTV) have a better chance getting a smaller network off the ground because of their increased leverage.<p>Hopefully at some point the cable operators will move to a Switched Digital Video[1] system which would free up bandwidth and  allow for these smaller networks to get traction a bit easier, but its not going to happen soon and (hopefully) streamed internet networks will really start to flourish. Maybe the Ovations and Currents of the world will move this way sooner now.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switched_video"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switched_video</a>",1357181932

5000824,comment,5000328,5000328,2,0,cduan,,,"I wonder if this algorithm would still present biases given the fact that large cities tend to vote differently from less densely populated areas. My hypothesis is that this algorithm would favor city voters over rural voters, for the following reasons:<p>1. Successfully gerrymandering in favor of one party generally involves stuffing the other party's voters into one district, while splitting your party's voters into multiple districts.<p>2. The proposed algorithm favors straight-line divisions through regions such that about half the population of the region is on each side of the division.<p>3. Thus, chances are, the straight lines will run through the middles of cities, cutting cities into multiple districts.<p>I'd be interested to see someone test this out--it's likely that my hypothesis is wrong, but it also seems pretty likely to me that there will be at least some urban/rural bias, one way or another.",1357181741

5000821,comment,4996215,4997749,1,0,malandrew,,,"TBH, I don't see why the low on gas problem exists. How hard can it be to include a feature that measures fuel levels when picked up and dropped off. Pay drivers above market rate for gas for filling up the tank with more gas than it had when they received it and penalize them when they leave it empty.<p>Assuming gas is $4 per gallon, a zipcar has a 15 gallon tank and had 10 gallons when picked up, charge the driver $6 per gallon below the 10 gallons it had when it was picked up and pay the driver $5 per gallon for each gallon more than 10 gallons it has.<p>The only problem I see with this approach is quality of fuel used by the driver. There is no way that I know of to enforce the octane level of the fuel pumped. However this is a problem that will exist either way.<p>There could also be sensors for other things, such as a smoke detector to make sure that someone isn't smoking in the car. I don't know if it's possible to make a sensor that makes sure a car is kept clean, but as more and more cars are used for car sharing I see the demand for such sensors to rise enough to justify bringing such sensors to market.",1357181614

I am sure you have also come across this problem many times.<p>Three months ago I purchased a domain name for a startup venture. I have created a launch page, made business cards, created a logo; I have already accumulated a lot of signups in 3 weeks time and done a bit of marketing. I even have a few customers already.<p>Today I received a totally random email from a guy who is the owner of a very similar domain name. He has sent me a cease and desist letter, because apparently he owns the trademark. I have double-checked this on the USPTO website and everything seems legit.<p>However what estranges me is the fact that he has not setup a business. He bought the domain in 2010 to setup a company and I believe he quit before he launched. Now he made me an offer to sell the trademark and the domain name, or else desist from using the name. I did not ask him how much he wants for this, because I am sure it will be some crazy 6-digit figure that I will not be able to afford.<p>Now I have to change my business name.<p>I am lucky that my startup is still new and I haven't spent a fortune on marketing. Imagine if this was a year down the line... Many founders don't have the flexibility to change names, so they have to pay up.<p>So dear people from HN, could we please spread out the message on why this is so wrong! Every single time I go to a domain registrar, I can't use 90% of the names, because these domain leechers bought everything to make a profit.",1357181421

I argued it was fallacious to say that flattening the morality of the issue just because standards were lower during the war results in less of a need to discuss Switzerland's crimes during this time. You haven't attempted to refute this point, yet your latest post still made the statement that ""I was only replying specifically to the two claims that you made [Swiss rejection of refugees and theft from Holocaust victims]"" (which is aside from the fact that I am not the original author of the post you first responded to.)<p>So it's still curious why you felt the need to rebuff 	\ngadders criticism of the Swiss during WW2 given that it was on topic, even acknowledging similar actions take by the US.",1357179350

I can do this:<p><pre><code>  params[:id] = {:select => ""select * from users where admin = 1 limit 1; --""}\n  User.find_by_id(params[:id]) # => finds the first admin\n  # generated SQL:\n  # SELECT * from users where admin = 1 limit 1; -- select * FROM `users` WHERE (`users`.`id` IS NULL) LIMIT 1\n</code></pre>\nSeems like a bigger bug than you seem to think it is.  Merely accepting JSON and not calling .to_i is enough for me to select any user.<p>-- edit: maybe nvm on that, it requires an actual symbol, not a string key with a hash with indifferent access, like you'd get from JSON.  Unless someone knows a way to get a symbol into a JSON or form-encoded field?  Though you're vulnerable to this specifically if you use '.symbolize_keys' anywhere before it's passed in.<p>-- edit2: and I see I'm late to the game anyway, thanks tenderlove :)",1357179057

And the result seems to be that Java is increasingly scorned.<p>I know if I had to replace my C# work with Java, I'd feel incredibly frustrated at the lack of language power.

That requires a round-trip verification.  I get it. At least you ensure that it isn't all garbage-in to begin with.<p>The other aspect of email verification is that you don't have to choose to bug the user with the results.  Depending on what it is, if someone enters an obviously junky address you can simply tag that email as potential crud in your database.  Someone would then manually look at these every so often for cleanup or re-categorization.<p>I don't like the idea of looking signups or customers in a transaction where both parties are interested in transferring the information accurately.  That's a use-case where validation works well.<p>Now, regarding your last name.  The issue is cause by programmers who simply go around grabbing code off the internet without vetting it in any way.

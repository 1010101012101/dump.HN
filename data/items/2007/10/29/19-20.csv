They can't buy stakes in smaller companies without eventually paying someone to build a better Google (at the expense of the current Google), but there's not much else they can do to get around the fact that, as the best company in their business, they have nowhere to go but down.",1193687508

They were FORCED to go public when their ESOP reached 500 employees.  Imagine that, earning revenue and going public against your wishes when you already have enough cash.\n",1193686347

And without throttling.<p>I signed up for their $99 Triple-Play package and my first several bills have been for $185.  And the tv and internet service is out about 80% of the time.  I had to arrange for satellites to be installed in order to conduct business while they try to sort it all out.<p>Bastards.",1199867211

96278,comment,96143,96224,0,0,gojomo,,,"It requires negligible (no?) traffic to keep a TCP socket 'continuously connected' when data is not being sent. (The only resource cost is the state at both endpoints remembering the socket exists.) OTOH, every 'poll' involves a lot of socket and HTTP request/response overhead traffic -- even if there's no update necessary.<p>Still, this article overclaims the comet case. Polling is often easier to understand/implement/debug. It requires less server-side state and may be less likely to hit practical server-side implementation limits.",1199865624

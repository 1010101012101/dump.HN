8380870,comment,8380344,8380767,0,0,robotpony,,,"It&#x27;s a common mistake for medium and large companies too. Most budgets are poured into design and development, which encourages adding requirements, more design, etc., not leaving anything for ongoing content development and marketing. The result is a site with more pages than it needs and pages that are all boilerplate, puff, and sparsely related to pushing the purpose. The effort is distracting and mostly futile, especially lacking marketing time and effort.<p>If I can make a recommendation, the only pages that should be added to the web are those that make the it better. Are you a web services company? Expose your service as part of your site (Github does this by providing a Google-searchable central hub of OSS projects). Are you a non-profit? Obsess over getting people involved instead of spreading your message: adding people builds up your voice, spreading your message spreads you thinner (and adding people spreads your message with less effort). SEO is best played as adding, building, and providing useful things (or collaborations). And the best improvements in search rankings is had by providing useful things for people to reference (the Github example again). If you&#x27;re not providing something to link to, preferably a never ending stream of awesomeness, SEO and other marketing become difficult.<p>I&#x27;ve been part of many very wasteful website projects, with dozens of about pages, blog listings, categories, and other nonsense that on their own do not make something worth investing in. Put up as little as you can, make it useful, and focus on marketing what you do to people with the rest of your $.",1411937452

8380866,comment,8379315,8380788,1,0,buro9,,,"Exactly... Tor nodes that don&#x27;t just let anything through, but do let &quot;safe&quot; (to some agreed definition) web traffic through. Then a client could say &quot;only exit via safe nodes&quot; and you&#x27;d have this much better chance that the exit hadn&#x27;t been used for the nefarious purposes that were likely to have resulted in an IP being blocked or challenged.<p>I get what you said in the earlier comment, but it sounds like CF would run a node and people would need to connect to it. I&#x27;m not sure of the implementation details, but either that&#x27;s only a single hop through Tor (thus reducing the privacy/anonymity), or you&#x27;re still making a single entry/exit point be the focus of all traffic from a given user (reducing privacy/anonymity by creating a single target for state attacks - likely court order based).<p>There&#x27;s got to be a way to keep the multi-hop high-privacy and high-anonymity for those who need it, without having those users treated the same as those using Tor to hide various attacks (spam, the kind of attacks the CF WAF mitigates the risk of, etc).<p>I think this idea of Tor nodes that are trusted to have implemented various policies, and that only exit traffic that has filtered out attacks (and obvious spam), kinda works. By protecting the IP reputation of the exit node, we get a Tor that isn&#x27;t being penalised and affecting the end user experience <i>and</i> that doesn&#x27;t reduce the privacy/anonymity stuff that is important.",1411937266

8380857,comment,8379483,8380678,1,0,tzs,,,"> The big problem is: what happens when a cop comes out on a call and there is clear photographic evidence of a crime being committed (very likely, considering the sheer number of things that are technically illegal)? When there is clear video evidence of, say, possession of paraphernalia, assault, public intoxication, or whatever else, it suddenly becomes a lot easier to pick on citizens<p>Worse, if these routine recordings leak, or if they are available to the public under freedom of information requests or something similar, then every time a cop lets someone off who they could have arrested someone will find a reason to criticize that. If they let a white person off, they will be complaints that they would have arrested the guy if he was black. If they let a black guy off, there will be complaints that they only care about stopping crime in white neighborhoods. Let a woman off with a warning on a traffic stop, and there will be complaints that a man would have received a ticket.<p>It will not take officers long to figure out that they are a lot better off if they arrest every one of these paraphernalia possessors, publicly intoxicated people, and so on that they see and let the courts sort them out.

(I worked entirely on Plan 9, which I still believe does a pretty good job of solving those fundamental problems.) I was surprised when I came back to Unix how many of even the little things that were annoying in 1990 continue to annoy today. In 1975, when the argument vector had to live in a 512-byte-block, the 6th Edition system would often complain, &#x27;arg list too long&#x27;. But today, when machines have gigabytes of memory, I still see that silly message far too often. The argument list is now limited somewhere north of 100K on the Linux machines I use at work, but come on people, dynamic memory allocation is a done deal!<p>&quot;I started keeping a list of these annoyances but it got too long and depressing so I just learned to live with them again. We really are using a 1970s era operating system well past its sell-by date. We get a lot done, and we have fun, but let&#x27;s face it, the fundamental design of Unix is older than many of the readers of Slashdot, while lots of different, great ideas about computing and networks have been developed in the last 30 years. Using Unix is the computing equivalent of listening only to music by David Cassidy.&quot;<p><a href=""http://slashdot.org/story/04/10/18/1153211/rob-pike-responds?nobeta=1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://slashdot.org/story/04/10/18/1153211/rob-pike-responds...</a>",1411935428

There will be legal issues to decide if body cameras become commonplace about whether those are turned on by default, and how discoverable (and by whom) the videotaped records are, as the article submitted here reports, but this is just the kind of issue that courts and legislatures are equipped to deal with, especially if you the citizen make your point of view known. What&#x27;s new here is a technical means that for the first time can massively reduce the he-said, she-said disputes that have come up in complaints about police conduct.

However, the locals would have been rich in furs, which were extremely valuable in European markets.  If you have the element of surprise and superior weapons, along with a rich target, the temptation to raid and steal would have been overwhelming.

They also made up the Varangian Guard, the reputedly incorruptible bodyguard of the Eastern Roman emperors. There is also little doubt that the Christian sovereigns of this time period (and later) were not shy about the occasional gruesome slaughter against defenseless civilians, so I&#x27;d say the point made in the article about their brutality being a feature of the times is pretty accurate.<p>I can recommend Northlanders [1], by Brian Wood of DMZ fame, on this topic. Fairly well-researched and with good characterization.<p>1: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northlanders"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northlanders</a>",1411934606

It was scary. It was reported privately and then patched.  Never in this process did anyone have the source code to analyze and publish an early PoC like they did shellshock and heartbleed. When the patch was released, it was a binary, so no one could just compare the old code to the new and figure out exactly what the problem was and launch an attack. Sure, they could analyze the binary, but that gives limited and often unusable results. Or at the very least puts up enough barriers to buy time for patch installs.<p>Its funny, years ago we used to worry about our Windows servers, now only worry about our linux servers. FOSS&#x27;s transparency is ugly when it comes to exploits because they go from discovered to in the wild very, very quickly. Even when they don&#x27;t, once the patch is released, the hackers have the exploit instantly, and that means if your organization can&#x27;t patch for a couple hours, you&#x27;re screwed. The recent Drupal exploit is a good example of this. It went from published to bots hacking Drupal installs within seven hours. Millions of sites were affected.",1436453867

9858177,comment,9857255,9857255,0,0,davismwfl,,,"There are so many sides of business that it is hard to say learn &quot;business&quot;.  It isn&#x27;t unlike technology in that regard, as people specialize in specific areas to get the most of their skills, even though many of those skills are similar.<p>Marketing, Accounting, Sales, Business Development, Leadership, Public Relations, Customer Service, etc.  All these are different, some seem overly similar and share common skills but there are subtle nuances that make them all unique.  Small businesses a lot of times collapse Marketing & Sales and don&#x27;t have a PR or BD team at all.  Small to Mid-sized businesses will combine Marketing and Business Development many times as the skills overlap keeps it cost effective.   Large enterprises have the luxury of knowing (and the ability to afford) that while the skills may overlap, you can&#x27;t simultaneously be good at it all, so they break it up.<p>IMO, the best way to learn &quot;business&quot; is to recognize you can&#x27;t do it all and be good from day 1.  So pick 1-2 to work on, read and study.  I personally suggest Sales and Marketing because without those you have nothing to Account for, employees to lead or customers to service.  Read Crossing the Chasm (3rd edition), it is a great book on getting your product from the early adopters into the mainstream purchase cycle.  It is also a quick read overall. As for Accounting, outsource it, when you are small it is cheap to outsource and you don&#x27;t need the headache of jacking it up come tax time.  But when you outsource it, spend time every week or month with the person doing the work and learn from them what they are doing and more importantly why.  This lets you stay focused but still learn the basics of Accounting.<p>As for validating startup ideas.  There are lots of methods, you should check out patio11&#x27;s blog write ups as he talks about it when he started Appointment Reminder.  In general though, and IMO, validating a startup idea is when people actually pay you for it, not just when someone says &quot;cool idea&quot;.  The difference seems minor but is huge, lots of prospects will tell you that it is an awesome idea, but when you say ok, fork over $50 or $5000 or whatever all the sudden they are like, yea, well I mean....  Same if you are seeking venture money, if you are not getting meetings or are being blown off you have to reevaluate your idea to make sure that you are pitching it correctly and that you are actually pitching something worth while.  That doesn&#x27;t mean you change ideas after the first 10 no&#x27;s, just that you keep evaluating it to make sure you aren&#x27;t too far off track and that you are communicating things correctly.",1436453745

It&#x27;s far easier to step a photon down in energy than to absorb multiple lower energy photons and emit one at higher energy.<p>But the highest efficiency color for LEDs to produce largely depends on what Cree and Nichia are doing this year.  Unfortunately, most of the readily available numbers tout luminous efficiency rather than raw light power.  That&#x27;s fine if you&#x27;re looking for a reading light, but chlorophyll does not have the same absorption spectrum as the opsins in the human eye.  You have to look for &quot;wall-plug efficiency&quot;, which is less commonly reported.<p>So with respect to photons emitted per watt, I&#x27;m not sure which LED chemistry takes the prize.  It depends on the temperature and input power, too.  You can achieve 200% wall-plug efficiency, but only if you&#x27;re converting picowatts of electricity into picowatts of photons in a hot LED.  This is not possible (economically) for grow lights.<p>The benchmark for grow lights is the low-pressure sodium lamp, at about 38% efficiency.  LEDs maybe get 30-65%, considering transformers, internal resistance, quantum efficiency, reflective losses at the die-capsule interface, etc.  Higher efficiency comes from more expensive components.<p>As for chemistry, InGaN efficiency drops at longer wavelengths, and AlInGaP efficiency drops at shorter wavelengths, leaving a big efficiency trough in the green range.  (Fortunately for this, plants don&#x27;t need green.)  I suspect that AlInGaP LEDs in the orange range are more efficient than visible blue InGaN LEDs, but this is hard to show with a lazy web search.<p>So when you say &quot;most efficient&quot; you really have to be <i>very explicit</i> about the application.

There is a decent amount of research showing saturated fat has inflammatory effects in the body and directly causes insulin resistance. For a long time doctors have had success encouraging patients to eat diets excluding America&#x27;s primary sources of saturated fat (red meat, bacon/lard and butter).<p>In addition, dietary fat intake does influence triglycerides, LDL and VLDL; fairly good correlations exist between these levels and heart disease.  It is only recently we have discovered that sub-types of these particles exist, and not all of them have the same impact on health.  Additionally, the knowledge that excess carbohydrate intake can actually have a larger impact on these levels is somewhat more recent.<p>The bias against mono- and poly- unsaturated fats given all the research that exists on their beneficial health effects is still bat-shit crazy, though.",1436453436

I feel as though this statement implies that front end dev is not complex and therefore it surprises you that there is room for significant improvement. I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s not what you were thinking, but really, building complex imperative UIs with state can be very difficult, and react does represent a new step in the paradigm shift away from imperative development. Whether React is the future or not, components and composition are here to stay, and I think a increasingly large portion of the community is interested in writing web applications with immutability--all of which suites flux (and react) very well, and does not suite jquery very well.<p>React doesn&#x27;t enable anything that you simply couldn&#x27;t do with jquery and backbone, but it does make a lot of it way easier and reduces overall complexity by a ton, especially if you&#x27;re developing with component structure and immutability in mind.",1436453256

Measurement technique (getting the data)\n  2. System dynamics calculations (analyzing the data)<p>For measurement, the article mentions both visual and spectroscopic (wavelength) measurements; overviews of these and other techniques are discussed in [1]. You are correct, distance from the measurement device makes things interesting, especially in the presence of atmospheric distortion, but there are lots of tricks that can improve the effective resolution (eg, speckle imaging, which uses a bunch of images taken in rapid succession [2]).<p>As for the orbital period, think of it like measurements of a line. You don&#x27;t need every point, just two. If you have several measurements of a celestial body, you can plot them on one of the (MANY) celestial coordinate systems [3] and do some estimates. Longer periods mean more observations for better accuracy, but you don&#x27;t need to wait for a complete orbital period to get a decent estimate.<p>Hope this at least gives some useful keywords for your searches!<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_star#Methods_of_observation"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_star#Methods_of_observa...</a>\n[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speckle_imaging"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speckle_imaging</a>\n[3] <a href=""http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr161/lect/time/coordinates.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr161/lect/time/coordinates.htm...</a>",1436452712

For that you <i>need</i> document clustering. In our case (and probably others), the clustering can&#x27;t be done uniformally, see <a href=""http://engineering.datarank.com/2015/06/30/analysis-of-hotspots-in-clusters-of-log-normally-distributed-data.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://engineering.datarank.com/2015/06/30/analysis-of-hotsp...</a>.<p>&quot;Writes initially only happen on primary shards, and then propagate to replicas.&quot; - also true but you still want this to be as distributed as possible. In some cases we are bulk loading millions of documents. We want the load to be equally distributed as possible while still allowing for clustering as mentioned above. Also, we want to minimize heap usage per node for GC and buffering performance.<p>&quot;At some point you&#x27;ll have to redesign your ES architecture.&quot; - Perhaps but this system scales to 100s nodes easily and maybe 1000s. We allow our customers to perform very complex aggregates on some pretty large datasets with 50ms response times. All other architectures we tried failed to scale well.<p>Clustering of comments is vital to our use case for performance. Our data is distributed log-normally.

Time helps.<p>Creating reliable software-intensive systems is something we know how to do, we have repeatedly done it in the past, and we are doing in the present.  Only problems are it ain&#x27;t cheap in terms of money or time, so to be cost effective, the costs associated with failure or malfunction must be high.<p>Safety critical systems (where human health can be endangered by system failures and malfunctions) are one such system.  They&#x27;re usually developed under some sort of regulatory oversight (e.g., FAA, FDA).  There are a set of minimal government standards that must be met, much of these related to documentation, and much of the documentation relating to risk analysis and quality management.  There are also standards administered by industry groups---often, these are &quot;voluntary&quot; in name but for liability reasons practically required (in my experience).  There&#x27;s going to be some sort of (mandated) monitoring of the product after release (which feeds into the quality system) to correct design flaws, defects, etc.  You have regulatory affairs people on staff to handle this area.  The safety critical system itself is developed under some sort of formal product lifecycle management system.  There will be a formal set of requirements.  Early in the process, there will be a risk analysis (continually updated) of the design.  There will be an a priori development plan, timeline, and cost estimates.  As for development models, the waterfall model is alive and well, in part because it coöperates with the demanding documentation requirements; waterfall does seem to be on the decline in favor of more agile models (but not too agile!).<p>The software itself may be assembler if you&#x27;re really resource constrained, but more likely, it will be C or C++ with a restrictive coding standard, or real-time Java, or possibly Ada.  If you&#x27;re fancy (and progressive), there might be a system model with automatic code generation.  The tooling you adopt (e.g., from Atego) will assist with verification and validation, as well as requirements traceability.  Most people, I think, find software work under these conditions to be boring and frustrating---it&#x27;s certainly limiting.  You&#x27;re maybe generating 100 SLOC a day?  The system is almost certainly running on some sort of real-time OS like vxWorks or QNX, and the hardware, software, and any associated libraries are (as much as possible) validated for use for your application.  You can, given the right circumstances, use COTS software (a.k.a. SOUP, software of unknown pedigree), but then the validation becomes your responsibility.<p>The HN crowd hates it, but in my experience on these sorts of projects, degrees and certifications are required and expected except at perhaps the very lowest level of employees.  Electrical and mechanical designs are probably stamped by a real engineer; depending on the nature of the software portion (and where it&#x27;s being developed) the software design might get stamped too, but more likely, it&#x27;s being supervised by someone with a bunch of industry-relevant certifications.<p>I&#x27;ve glossed over a ton, and skipped even more.<p>In my opinion: I think that the most important lesson to learn from safety critical projects (and good engineering practice in general) is that tools are not the major driver of quality: proper engineering processes and quality management are the driver of quality.  A &quot;right-sized&quot; product lifecycle management plan, including a &quot;right-sized&quot; quality system are critical and necessary to predictably and reliably produce a quality product.  All else being equal, I&#x27;d predict that a C application developed under a lightweight PLM and QMS will be superior to one developed under Agile and Rust, or Scrum and Haskell, or whatever the du jour fad might be.",1436451741

If you do that, you are basically forced to use monads for all effects, and that is very questionable.<p>You aren&#x27;t forced to use <i>monads</i> specifically. What you&#x27;re forced to do is distinguish pure from impure computations <i>somehow</i>. In the CBPV papers, it&#x27;s clearly explained that functions are just one particular kind of computation. In CBPV, there&#x27;s an adjunction between the categories of value types and computation types, and it&#x27;s this adjunction that gives rise to a monad [corresponding to the effect(s) that computations might exhibit]. If we consider pure computations only [no effects, not even nontermination], this adjunction is actually an equivalence of categories.<p>---<p>> Yeah, Rust does something nice, too, but every operation allowed by Clojure is also allowed by Rust. I don&#x27;t see how it&#x27;s any better. Erlang&#x27;s &quot;let it crash&quot; has nothing to do with data-race bugs.<p>I&#x27;m not talking about data races. Of course the absence of sharing in Erlang frees you from data races. But they don&#x27;t free you from breaking transactional invariants, such as &quot;this doesn&#x27;t even begin happening unless that condition is met&quot;. In spite of the absence of data races, Erlang is still about coping with failure, not outruling it. In Rust, you can use a nonforgeable witness that the precondition holds, and consume it when the operation begins. It&#x27;s rare that a non-dependently typed language is better than Haskell at something other than performance, but that&#x27;s exactly what&#x27;s happening here.<p>> Once you have a GC everything is a lot easier when it comes to concurrency. Rust works very hard to ensure safety without a GC, which is necessary for domains that can&#x27;t use GCs (like programs in constrained environments).<p>Garbage collection makes <i>sharing</i> easy. However, concurrency control (i.e., controlling access to shared mutable resources) remains just as hard. Otherwise, nobody would have invented such things as &quot;global interpreter locks&quot;.<p>> And in any case, I think most people would consider Rust to be even less functional or more imperative (whatever that means) than Clojure.<p>Indeed, Rust isn&#x27;t terribly functional (though it&#x27;s more functional that meets the eye), which is exactly why I said it&#x27;s a better argument for &quot;there are other ways besides functional programming&quot;.<p>---<p>> I also challenge you to program the world&#x27;s most used sorting algorithm, TimSort, with equational reasoning.<p>Well, in order to use equational reasoning alone, I need a purely functional algorithm.<p>> And consider this -- Haskell is grossly insufficient to really reason about programs in this way. Idris is the very minimum to even start, and even that doesn&#x27;t even begin to scratch temporal logic.<p>Haskell&#x27;s type system is insufficient to verify equational reasoning <i>using the type system</i>, but equational reasoning is so simple that programmers can do it manually anyway. [More on this later.] On the other hand, programming languages based on dependent type theory, like Idris, while often more beautiful, and certainly more powerful, don&#x27;t yet pass my bang for the buck test for everyday programming: (0) They force me to annotate things that Haskell can infer on its own. (1) It is a royal pain in the ass to manually translate data between representations that are convenient for proving [e.g., Peano naturals] and representations that are efficient for calculating things at runtime [e.g., machine integers, big integers]. (2) Most dependently typed languages often don&#x27;t have terribly efficient implementations. To the best of my knowledge, ATS is the only honorable exception to the last point.<p>---<p>> That is a mathematical argument. Not a psychological one. You could use the same argument to claim that teaching a person to catch a ball is easier if you teach them Newton&#x27;s equations than let them practice.<p>Your analogy breaks when you think about it non-superficially. Merely understanding the laws of physics won&#x27;t make your muscles strong enough, or your reflexes fast enough to go out there and actually catch a ball. On the other hand, when you&#x27;ve written a program alongside its proof of correctness, well, you&#x27;ve written a program!<p>---<p>> Yes, imperative programming is too complicated for machines to verify in every circumstance, yet claiming it is too complicated for humans pretty much ignores reality (or, at the very least, requires some serious explaining).<p>It&#x27;s too complicated for humans to verify too. If it weren&#x27;t, more people would be doing it casually. This is unarguable, unless you&#x27;ve tried it yourself.<p>> even with security, memory safety has done a lot to make things better, and where it hasn&#x27;t, dependent types would be necessary to prove correctness, anyway.<p>I never said that everything has to be <i>machine</i> verified. If you give me a proof that I can understand (i.e., I&#x27;m confident I can correctly verify), that&#x27;s more than enough for me.

I understand the principles involved, but actually going from  &quot;Here&#x27;s my complete data model, handled by this controller&quot; to &quot;Here&#x27;s an angular application with a number of controllers and services&quot; isn&#x27;t something I&#x27;ve managed to do.

9857943,comment,9851505,9854943,0,0,tel,,,"> a non-Haskell (or Haskell-like) PFP<p>I&#x27;d immediately suggest that Haskell is not a particularly pure language itself and that you should take a look at { Coq, Agda, Idris } for far more ideas about where PFP ought to go. You can also without too much difficulty imagine an ML derivative which is pure although they are historically not.<p>In all of these cases, laziness is not a component and many of your &quot;the lack of clear execution models, the lack of clear thread context (which is, of course, related), the difficulty in analyzing computational complexity, in debugging and profiling, and implementing many simple algorithms&quot; arise directly out of laziness alone.<p>> you&#x27;re not advocating 100% abstraction explicitness<p>To put my cards on the table, I am advocating for this at least some of the time. :)<p>I&#x27;m interested in the idea of there being a tension between favoring abstractions versus favoring algorithms. I understand what you mean anecdotally, but am not sure how to put it into a larger context. In many ways I feel abstractions create the hard outlines of algorithms and are indispensable. This I feel is true even if you&#x27;re, e.g., programming in Forth. The difference is not a lack of (even higher order) abstraction but merely a difference in how much of that structure you communicate to your compiler.<p>Re: continuations.<p>Having access to arbitrary continuation semantics is equally powerful to &quot;all monads combined together&quot; in the sense of &quot;what you can encode&quot; but, then, simultaneously, ultimately weak in the sense of &quot;how many ways can you interpret this&quot;. On the other hand, restricting the set of continuations you have access to is <i>completely identical</i> to choosing a monad.<p>You say that the only difference is whether you pick things at the top or bottom. I say that this isn&#x27;t even an actual difference. In both cases you&#x27;re effecting the exact same thing and, if you like, it would be fair to analyze it as a monad.<p>Monads aren&#x27;t equivalent to Haskell&#x27;s encoding of them. Even Haskell admits many encodings. The first-order ones like we&#x27;re used to seeing are popular because they&#x27;re simple to understand and implement not because they&#x27;re the only way. As an example, here&#x27;s the monad stack at the core of Attoparsec, a fast parser combinator library<p><pre><code>    Parser a\n    ~\n    forall r.\n      (Buffer, Int, Bool) ->\n      ((Buffer, Int, Bool) -> ([String], String) -> Result r) ->\n      ((Buffer, Int, Bool) -> a -> Result r) ->\n      Result r\n\n    Result r\n    ~\n      Fail Text [String] String\n    | Partial (Text -> Result r)\n    | Done Text r\n</code></pre>\nThis is unapologetically a monad based on 2 continuations, the second and third arguments to the Parser function are the success and failure continuations which respond to being threaded on a continuation state and either `([String], String)`, a bundle of error messages or `a` a final result.<p>Re: lamppost<p>I agree a lot with what you&#x27;re saying here. In particular, I think there are two ways to attempt to answer the (silly, but then you take it seriously) question &quot;what is the greatest programming language possible?&quot;<p>First, you can ask for power measured in &quot;How completely does this language serve to articulate and circumscribe any thought which I might, as a human, want to have?&quot;. Following this line necessitates following logic carefully not because it&#x27;s magically better but because mathematicians have spent many centuries delimiting interesting, complex ideas and at least 1 century working dedicatedly on a language for describing them. It&#x27;s silly not to crib off this effort... or to think any other field is going to surpass it.<p>Second, you can ask for whatever language best fits the human mind with all of its quirks. This is a question of psychology, of course, and design and I would never claim that it&#x27;s not incredibly important... although I do often give it short shrift.<p>The reason being that I have some personal chips on the idea that these two goals actually will wind up in the same place more-or-less. This isn&#x27;t to claim that mathematics doesn&#x27;t have <i>massive</i> ergonomics issues today... but instead to claim that it is in many ways an ultimate distillation of the logic all of our minds are marinating in... just as a consequence of living in this universe and partaking in this shared experience.<p>I feel like Mathematics took on the challenge of mapping out the <i>entire</i> human headspace from the inside out and psychology took on the same challenge but working from the outside in. I have to believe they&#x27;ll converge someday.<p>And then, maybe finally, someone will write a language with good error messages.",1436451441

9857876,story,,,32,43,goferito,"Ask HN: How can I trust Google Analytics?",,"I&#x27;ve made a small proof of concept with Google Analytics. I was checking that running the frontend code coming from my localhost I could already receive the events on my Google Analytics (GA) account. So GA is just not running any kind of validation on where the events are coming from (domain check or something). Then, since the tracking ID remains public, it&#x27;s possible to just send any kind of event using someone else&#x27;s tracking ID, therefore messing with their insights in their GA dashboard. I have published the code on github.com/goferito/gapoc in case someone wants to take a look, even though it&#x27;s pretty simple.<p>So the question is, how can I know someone is not sending events (pageview events or whatever) using my tracking ID? Is there any way in GA to filter those, before or after GA stores them?",1436450551

9857872,comment,9851293,9851605,0,0,exelius,,,"Yeah, but quality at the low end had to be a trend they saw coming. Apple and Samsung commoditized high-end manufacturing -- you need a lot of expensive equipment to build iPhones and Galaxy phones, but that equipment is a lot less expensive when it&#x27;s being sold off to make room for newer, more expensive equipment. So low-end manufacturers can buy it and start churning out high quality, low cost phones.<p>And I don&#x27;t doubt that Microsoft can be #3 in the phone market; I just don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a worthwhile thing for them to aspire to do as a company. They will be perpetually fighting for market share, and that will tempt them to leverage their other products in ways that forego other potentially more profitable strategies for those other products. The phone market is a distraction for them at this point; and I wouldn&#x27;t be shocked at all if they spin off the entire consumer electronics division (including Xbox) in the next 5 years.",1436450482

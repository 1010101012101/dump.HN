161726,comment,161662,161722,0,0,adammichaelc,,,"So you inherited somebody else's debt collector problem. That's hilarious! I'm actually laughing as I write this because I know exactly what it feels like to have debt collectors calling. In fact, I just got a nice, shiny new letter from my friendly local attorney.<p>My 1st startup didn't go so well, nor was it structured well. So this summer I'm doing door-to-door sales to get out of debt. Kind of lame. I'd much rather work on my next startup, but I want my wife to stay sane....",1207983347

Maintenance and support (billed annually) is really what they're interested in.<p>And don't forget that the more that someone's paid for something, the more willing they are to scream bloody murder until whatever issue (they think) they're having is fixed.",1207983207

You're right that just because it's been done doesn't mean you can't do it better and get it right. Would Yelp exist if they thought -- oh, darn, Citysearch seems to have the whole market, we'll never win.<p>That being said, you should consider starting with a specific community you know, getting it in the hands of real users, and iterating like crazy. These things can't be developed in an intellectual vacuum.<p>Best of luck!",1207983100

But the value that it has coupled with the fact that it's free make it a very strong alternative to GotVmail.com and other options for storing and tracking voicemail's.<p>It's also pretty new.

161718,comment,161269,161580,0,0,alex_c,,,"That's not the point of brand advertising though. The point is to hammer the consumer with a brand over and over again until they KNOW that's the brand for them and go out and seek it on their own.  Think Coke, Ford, etc.  Facebook has terrible click-through rates, so if they're going to make money from advertising, it'll probably be this way.",1207982349

After that, they'll learn themselves. I had this with my mum, who is now happy googling away, buying things from amazon, and watching youtube.<p>Start small, with the benefits of one or two sites. Find a site that offers a batch of benefits together -- say, google, google mail, google video, google maps, and google shopping -- and tell them that this is 'home.' In fact, you could just tell them that Google is the internet, teach them to compose a search, and be done with it. People take to the web very naturally once they try it.",1207980609

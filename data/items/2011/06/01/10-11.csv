2606733,comment,2605470,2606462,3,0,maethorechannen,,,"Isn't the ""you couldn't build it without GNU tools"" argument somewhat silly, as no other OS out there includes the toolchain as part of the name? I doubt the folks over at Microsoft would seriously consider renaming Windows ""Visual Studio/Windows"" or ""TFS/Windows"", yet they would be hard pressed to build Windows without it. I'm also fairly sure Linux isn't the only OS out there that can be built with GNU tools (I thought Solaris was using it, at least during the brief period of time that they were open), yet it does seem to be the main target of the ""GNU's contribution should be specially recognized"" crowd - it's hard to see this as anything but sour grapes over Linux pretty much taking over the GPL licensed Unix-like kernel market away from Hurd.<p>""Surely no one here suggest dropping Linux as the appropriate name for the system?""<p>Linux based Android doesn't use Linux. Arguably the distro name is now the ""primary"" name (though this would still leave the FSF people feeling unloved). Thinking about it, I mostly say I use Ubuntu on the Desktop and Android on the phone and tablet and barely ever mention I run Linux nowadays.",1306925142
2606732,comment,2606580,2606580,2,0,Unosolo,,,"Free trials aren't free to the company. It's a promise given to customers that they will be able to make use of company's assets without payment. Company normally has to pay for both the actual usage that occurs and the option of usage it has granted to it's customers so far. Trial subscription and expiry mechanism lets company control the maximum amount of free usage they have agreed to at any point in time.<p>Let's say you came up with a new and innovative service that let's people publish pictures they took with a mobile phone into the cloud. Because you calculate it will cost you on average one dollar per user account per month to provide the service you decide to charge your users $5 per month.<p>To attract new users you also decide to give them opportunity to try the service before they commit. You have a few options:<p>1. Let users upload the pictures in reduced quality for free unless they convert into premium. You're worried that this strategy will distort your user base: people who actually need best possible quality will not get a true impression of your service. On the other hand you will have to pay indefinitely for the storage and bandwidth of a whole lot of inferior quality pictures. Even worse the policy will attract whole group of non-paying users that will be content with the inferior picture quality and will make a heavy use of your service.<p>2. Let people upload up to 50 pictures free. In which case again you'll end up with having to pay for non-paying customers storing their pictures forever. Even worse some unscrupulous people will end up opening hundreds of accounts and some kid in Russia will write a utility working on top of your service seamlessly opening and amalgamating free accounts for a single user.<p>3. Set a free trial period of 30 days when users can upload pictures for free. After 30 days they will either have to convert into paying customers or download their data because you're going to automatically purge the free accounts. You're worried that 30 days may not be enough for some people to evaluate your service, but then you decide to look at the conversion stats; after-all if the prospect couldn't make up their mind after 30 days maybe the need wasn't that pressing and you shouldn't be wasting your company resource trying to convert them?",1306925126
2606731,comment,2605739,2606271,21,0,forensic,,,"The value proposition of the Ruby community has more to do with their mindshare than their technical merit.<p>Compare and contrast Scientology with Psychiatry. Both communities make similar value propositions: improve mental health.<p>Scientology is optimized to gain and keep converts and to spread like a viral meme.<p>Psychiatry is optimized to achieve good treatment outcomes.<p>Scientology makes more money despite being a less effective form of therapy.<p>Virality itself is adaptive, so the Ruby community thrives and survives despite being a mediocre technology. Everything about ruby is optimized for gaining converts, attention and cohesion. Hard technical merit is less important in this case than community cohesion, growth, and publicity. Flamewars bring the ruby community publicity and this leads to growth which leads to the survival and replication of ruby.<p>Erlang and C++ survive on hard technical merits.

(Work actually begins in January 1984.)<p>March 1987: first release of GCC.<p>June 1989: first release of bash.<p>May 1991: FSF announces that work on GNU Hurd (their own kernel) ""has begun"".<p>June 1991: first free-as-in-speech BSD release (""Net/2"").<p>October 1991: first release of glibc.<p>September 1991: first release of Linux (0.01) -- <i>not</i> free-as-in-speech.<p>March 1992: first release of 386BSD (0.0). July 1992: release 0.1, much more usable.<p>April 1992: USL v BSDi lawsuit filed. (This was a big obstacle to early adoption of the BSDs.)<p>December 1992: first free-as-in-speech release of Linux (0.99).<p>April 1993: first official release of NetBSD (0.8).<p>November 1993: first official release of FreeBSD (1.0).<p>January 1994: USL v BSDi lawsuit settled.<p>April 1994: FSF announces that the Hurd boots (but doesn't do anything much else).<p>May 2011: still waiting for the first truly usable release of GNU Hurd. No one seems to think it's very likely that there will ever be one.<p>So ... when the GNU project was announced, there weren't any free Unixes of any sort out there. It's possible that GNU really did create the whole idea of a free alternative to Unix. But the first free Unixoid kernel that was actually released was a BSD, and the first free whole Unixoid OS that was actually released was a BSD.",1306923193

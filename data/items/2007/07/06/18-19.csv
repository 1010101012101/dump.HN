I'm not convinced it's a one-size-fits-all strategy, but I tend to think that being out there is a lot more valuable than being stealthy.<p>The ""first mover advantage"" isn't much of one.  Looking at the top 10 internet properties (by traffic), you don't see a lot of first movers there (people who were the first in their space).  Also consider Walmart, Starbucks, the iPod, MS...  Not a first mover among them.  Not that they didn't innovate, but they were decidedly NOT first.<p>I don't think worrying about clones is worthwhile.  Once you're out there, you've already got a headstart-- it's unlikely that anyone can beat you to launch.  And if the only defensibility you have is a 6 month head start with a team of 3, you've got big problems.  You win by being the best (and having the best marketing), not by being first.",1183746939

I've been around managers who are proud of their job as a over-the-shoulder screaming maniac, and managers that sleep during meetings.  Until designs and projects are clearly defined, and individuals feel capable to independently fulfill the task, bad managers, pigeonholed managers, appear to be the corporate solution.",1183746823

I spent about 5 years as a manager, and I don't really want to do ""spreadsheet"" management again.  I want to own my project, and I don't mind being the lead with a small team, but I never want to be the ""status updater"" again.  <p>This reminds me of a phrase that irritates the $^%^ out of me - ""Better a good programmer than a bad manager.""  Of course, it's true - better a good anything than a bady anything, right?  But here are the two phrases that nobody seems to say...<p>""Better a good manager than a bad programmer"". <p>and finally...<p>""Better a good manager than a good programmer?""  or is it ""better a good programmer than a good manager?""<p>In many organizations, I'm convinced that the second is true.  Bad managers do have the ability to ruin a team, and so you need to make sure that you have a decent level of talent there.  But for a lot of companies, especially small ones working on innovative things (read: startups), the top techincal talent is vastly more important.  <p>In other words, if you have someone who could be a great technical contributor <i>and</i> a great technical manager, you're better off with the technical contributions.

Henning is right that they're going to become increasingly important in the future, but as long as you have threads and atomicity as building blocks, you should be able to do all the rest in the macro system.<p>Just make sure that some concurrency package eventually becomes a de facto standard.  Getting C libraries that use different threading implementations to interoperate is a nightmare, and I'd hate to see Arc go the same route.",1183746480

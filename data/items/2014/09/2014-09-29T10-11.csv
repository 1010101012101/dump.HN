8382294,comment,8380105,8381228,0,0,pron,,,"I realize you&#x27;re trolling, but let me try to explain this  (hopefully for the last time): I can certainly understand why people don&#x27;t like -- or don&#x27;t choose to use -- the languages I choose to use (Clojure, Java, C). Hell, I can give you some very serious criticism against them myself (Java can become tedious to write, especially if you&#x27;re working on relatively boring problems, and this might lead to demoralization, which is a very serious issue; in the past couple of years Clojure is also turning its attention to cleverness rather than getting things done, it&#x27;s also not obvious how to construct and maintain a large-scale project in Clojure, and its syntax is a real turnoff to many developers; C&#x27;s simplicity often comes at the expense of basic abstractions, like polymorphism, that actually assist in maintaining large codebases and dividing up work among developers, its concurrency story is severely lacking, and its security is terrible). So if someone tells me those languages aren&#x27;t for them -- for example, hiring young developers and keeping them enthusiastic by using a clever language is more important to them than long-term maintenance of the project -- I get that, I really do.<p>I also understand that you think it would be a wise decision on the part of Bank of America to write their software in Scala, or Raytheon to choose Scala for their aircraft carrier&#x27;s C3I system; maybe you believe that a more expressive type system will lead to fewer bugs in such large systems, or that fewer lines of code offset its cleverness. You might think that the extreme lengths taken to ensure you never have to cast a type during collection transformations isn&#x27;t PL-research showmanship that comes at the expense of code readability and getting stuff done, but a wise bug-preventing measure. But you should realize that people criticize your favorite language(s) for valid reasons. Maybe they have different constraints from yours, and maybe they favor other tradeoffs. Especially given that Scala -- unlike Java, Swift or Go -- was never meant to be &quot;a language for everyone&quot; (and neither is Clojure), it should come as no surprise that not everyone likes it, and for good reasons. Why, those reasons were deliberate! What I find annoying is trying to disown those decisions, deny those tradeoffs, and pretend Scala was a language designed not by professors and PhD students but by industry veterans. Both are, of course, excellent candidates for language design (look at Erlang and Haskell), but each group would choose different tradeoffs, and the languages they produce reflect that. Personally, I think &quot;PL research&quot; languages pave the path to the future and influence &quot;industry&quot; languages, but are often the wrong choice for serious industry projects. Going back to Erlang and Haskell, they&#x27;re an interesting example because both try to solve kind of the same issues, and they&#x27;re both <i>superb</i> languages; still, if the CTO of an airport asked me which language to use for their next critical system, I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate before recommending Erlang and warning -- quite strongly, in fact -- against choosing Haskell.",1411987040

It is my belief that SQL&#x27;s bad name came from the widespread use of MySQL&#x27;s partially functional engine and the poor performance caused by the lack of a proper query optimizer.<p>Aside: sometimes normal forms do cause too much additional overhead during queries, which is when you can use materialized views[2].<p>Not to mention that a normalized database is ripe for translation into analysis forms (cubes etc.), and that advanced tooling generally has a better understanding of normalized databases.<p>Basically, there are many more reasons (above the valid ones that you give) to have normalized forms and describe referential integrity.<p>[1] <a href=""http://antognini.ch/2010/01/join-elimination/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://antognini.ch/2010/01/join-elimination/</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Materialized_view"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Materialized_view</a>",1411986705

8382278,comment,8381748,8381748,21,0,rachbelaid,,,"As the author, it&#x27;s maybe worthwhile that I explain the goals of this post.<p>The first goal is about using your current architecture to solve small/medium search needs and help your project to introduce search without requiring to add components to your current architecture. It&#x27;s not a solution on the long run if your application revolve around search. I&#x27;m hoping that with the introduction of JSONB in 9.4, the idea of using Postgres as document store raise more attention on the search which can to be improved. But for an out-of-the-box feature, I think that the Postgres community did an amazing job. \nYou can imagine that you get something working with Postgres in matter of hours if you are already using it (and you are comfortable with PG), but if you have never used SOLR/ElasticSearch it will take you much longer to introduce it in your project and get started (Ops, document sync, getting familiar with query, ...).<p>The second goal, is about introducing full-text search concepts. The post try to guide the user to build a search from nothing to a quite decent full text search in English / French (I cannot give feedbacks on other languages)<p>The third which is probably the less clear is that people are still using MySQL search sometimes which is IMHO an horrible search solution. I think this happen because some web framework like django provide easy access to match in the ORM. In this context, the post is aimed also to provide MySQL user some insights about what can be done with Postgres and being more aware about its features.<p>If you are interested by the topic then I suggest you to have a look to the amazings posts from Tim van der Linden who did an amazing job of going into more details about the subject.<p><a href=""http://shisaa.jp/postset/postgresql-full-text-search-part-1.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://shisaa.jp/postset/postgresql-full-text-search-part-1....</a>\n<a href=""http://shisaa.jp/postset/postgresql-full-text-search-part-2.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://shisaa.jp/postset/postgresql-full-text-search-part-2....</a>\n<a href=""http://shisaa.jp/postset/postgresql-full-text-search-part-3.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://shisaa.jp/postset/postgresql-full-text-search-part-3....</a><p>Postgres full-text search is not the silver bullet of search but matter of your needs, it&#x27;s maybe good enough ;)",1411986569

A few really useful real-world use cases for templates are (IMHO):<p>- they can make interfaces more simple by using template methods/functions (have a single method which is specialized by the compiler, instead of polluting the API with 20 slightly different methods which only differ by the argument type)<p>- they can enable a coding style which &#x27;looks and feels&#x27; almost dynamic without loosing the strict type checks and optimization opportunities that a static type system provides<p>- they can help to keep related data close together in memory and minimize dynamic memory allocation (e.g. an array of structs instead of an array of pointers)<p>- the compiler has more optimization opportunities because it has more type information (vs. a more dynamic system where types are only known at runtime)<p>The tradeoff is of course that the compiler generates more (specialized) code, it breaks the simple rule that the amount of generated code grows linearly with the number of lines of code. On the other hand the compiler has a lot more type info to optimize the generated code. Still the programmer has to know what&#x27;s happening under the hood so he can weigh the advantages against the disadvantages.<p>[edit: formatting]",1411986337

Most of the diff sharing and discussion happens over email anyway. That&#x27;s where all the action is.<p>The main use case is that CVS distributes OK&#x27;d patches and allows us to revert them if they are later found to cause problems.<p>Everyone works on the head branch so there are never any surprises caused by delayed integration. Instead of using branches, the workflow switches between development mode and release mode when the time is right. Release branches receive only a handful of patches (usually less than 10) for the most critical issues discovered during their 1 year maintenance period. Again, CVS is entirely adequate for that.<p>It&#x27;s not like there was no usage of git at all.\nSome devs actually use git in private and even mail git-generated diffs around. If those diffs fail to apply to the CVS tree the burden is on them to fix that.\nSince x.org runs git, all the X11 and other graphics code is ported to OpenBSD in git branches by our X maintainers and committed to the main CVS tree once it&#x27;s ready to go live.

10807566,comment,10803860,10803860,0,0,crapolasplatter,,,"Here is my recipe for purchasing cars. At first I really tried to purchase a car through car-max because I hated the negotiating process with the normal dealers.<p>What I discovered was that car max typically priced their cars 2-3K above what I could negotiate with another dealer. I also discovered if you want a used honda don&#x27;t go to a honda dealer all the time, try going to a porche dealer or other high end dealers that don&#x27;t want those hondas in their inventory at the end of the month. Also be willing to walk away<p>Summary:<p>1. Goto car-max to get the max price of the vehicle and deduct 2-3k from it and try to find another dealer that will negotiate that price.<p>2. Goto to high end dealers for non high end cars.<p>3. Try to go towards the end of the month so I have been told by people in the business but I&#x27;m not sure on this.<p>4. Most importantly don&#x27;t be afraid to walk away . Last car I purchased I walked away then the dealer called me back a couple of weeks later and I got them for what I wanted to pay. This really shouldn&#x27;t be an issue as most cars are not one of a kind and can be found at anytime for purchase.<p>5. If the car is a hot model than all the above will likely be negated and they will be willing to not put to much time into selling you the car (negotiate)<p>6. Buy at the end of the year nov-dec timeframe. This is because once January hits the car will be officially a year older.<p>Hence the dealer will work harder to sell you that 2014 or 2015 model before it becomes 2016 and it gets tainted officially as last years or 2 years ago model.<p>7. Try to go by yourself and not with with your spouse or significant other , so you are the final word.",1451408233

So far we&#x27;re just doing drawing (no loops or anything), but with all the tedium of finding the keys and getting the commands just right.  I helped her make one routine that randomly changes the color, which she likes.  (She named the routine after herself – kids don&#x27;t need to stress over proper naming ;)<p>But I really wish there was material to get her started.  I haven&#x27;t found any introductory Logo books – finding an old book and updating it to a new dialect would be fine, but I&#x27;d appreciate some structure and thoughtfulness about the order of introduction.  I probably should print out some primers too, so I don&#x27;t have to remind her of RT and LT and FD every time.<p>I&#x27;ve been using this Logo interpreter: <a href=""http://www.calormen.com/jslogo/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.calormen.com/jslogo/</a> – it does all the traditional stuff pretty well, but it could also use this same sense of structure and content.  A kid should be able to sit down and think: here&#x27;s a thing I could try to do.  And here&#x27;s all the tools I need to do it.  Really that&#x27;s just content.<p>On the fancy side Hopscotch has been really impressive (significantly better than Scratch), but being iPad-only has been a problem.  That said, my daughter still appreciates Logo even compared to something fancy.<p>(One important thing about my daughter&#x27;s interest: I talk to her in detail about what I do.  The importance of this occurred to me during a parent education event I was at, where they noted: when you ask your kid how their day was and they disappointingly say &quot;fine&quot;, have you been telling them how your day was?  Parents need to demonstrate that kind of storytelling and engagement, and in my experience kids suck it up more than you&#x27;d expect, even stories about seemingly boring work stuff.)",1451408171

I have been editing various articles since 2010. I have won the Million Award[1] twice for major improvements to high-traffic articles. In the sciences I follow most closely in my own research, the Wikipedia articles are even worse than &quot;excessively technical and provide almost no context,&quot; and are often simply wrong. The worst part is that many Wikipedia articles about science are wrong more because of omission of things that every working scientist in each field knows than because of miscopying of correct statements about science. Most Wikipedia articles are still very thinly sourced, and most are based only on sources that appear online, and many of those sources are not from professionally edited publications.<p>I think it would be a good idea for a rich philanthropist to fund a Free Online Encyclopedia X Prize to see what combination of organizational, technological, and other factors could build a team of encyclopedia-compilers that could put together a better free, online encyclopedia than Wikipedia. Right now, Wikipedia gets a lot of external funding, but it has a surprisingly tiny number of active editors,[2] and the Wikimedia Foundation strategic plan still calls for more improvement of content.[3] I think Wikipedia has exceeded everyone&#x27;s expectations, and I see people who have access to better scholarly resources use it almost every time I&#x27;m with other scholars, but I also think Wikipedia today is like Excite or Lycos in 1998: the best available service in its category, but rather easily displaced by something as good as, say, AltaVista.

If it&#x27;s truly distributed in nature, you can help spread the attack surface through things like anycasting if you have you multiple datacenters. Also, the more distributed it is, the more likely it is to be spread out among your different transit links. The less distributed, the more likely it will hit a single transit link and take that out. You might have 10 different transit providers with 10gig links. 100 gbps of transit is nothing to scoff at for small companies. You can have an 11 gbps DDoS that makes you unreachable for large numbers of people if that 11 gbps lands on a single link (due to AS path length, MED, preference, etc). People at your company are asking you &quot;WTF network dude I thought we had 100gigs?&quot; You can then try to mess with padding route advertisements, but that just messes more with legit traffic than attack traffic.<p>Same thing with aggregated ethernet links (LACP/802.3ad). You might be 10x10gigs with a single provider, giving you a &quot;100gbps pipe&quot; but if it comes from a few sources all going after multiple destinations, a single link in that bundle could easily be overwhelmed. Then you start playing with the hashing algorithm, but it never really solves the problem.<p>The only solution right now is to get a bigger boat and get 100gbps links. It&#x27;s very expensive, not every transit provider offers that to every customer, lol if you run Cisco, and even then it&#x27;s honestly not big enough. Overrunning 100gbps interfaces with DoS traffic isn&#x27;t very hard to do if it comes from a few sources.<p>One must realize that not every country has the network diversity that the US does. In a lot of places, there are only a handful of AS networks that actually provide transit out of the country. This means that an entire country&#x27;s network traffic can flow over a few (or often times one) providers. This turns into a giant laser that blows out single provider or single LACP member links. China is a great example of this. There are really only 2 AS that provide egress from China. The third is reserved for high ranking party officials and ultra, megarich people who pay the bribes. Korea (and all the broadband that HN people drool over) has a few more transit networks, but not many. Korea is a potent DDoS cannon.<p>As far as content goes it&#x27;s by far mostly political and religious (> 70%). The remaining is the usual junk e-commerce, gambling, whistleblower sites, etc.<p>The lack of communication between transit providers and even between their customers is astoundingly bad. IMHO, there are good transit providers that will help you (NTT, Telia, XO) but most will tell you to go pound sand or not do anything until it starts disrupting their own network (Level3, Cogent, GTT, VZ, AT&T).",1451407239

They are owned by the dealership itself.<p>This, at least for the dealerships I work with, is almost never the case. For independent dealerships the only cars on the lot that they actually own are previous trade-ins. The majority are bought at auctions on credit (called &quot;floor planning&quot; in the industry). These are short term lines of credit that usually mature in 90 or 180 days. If the lot is productive, the unit will be long sold by then and the line of credit paid off, only to be used again. Depending on the number of sales made in the past year, the credit line with the floor plan company fluctuates.<p>Often, the same company (like Manheim in the US) owns the auction AND the floor plan financier. Cox Enterprises (Manheim&#x27;s parent company) and KAR Auction Services in particular seem to be buying up smaller businesses in the industry left and right not unlike your big players in Silicon Valley. My company has fielded offers from both in the past, but our owner won&#x27;t budge.<p>But I digress...the only other thing in the article that seems off to me is the emphasis on Certified Pre-Owned vehicles. Almost every dealer I work with will budge on that price. Making the sale is more important than a few extra dollars, in most cases. Plus, independent dealerships have a harder time with even getting vehicles certified, as opposed to the franchise stores that already have certified mechanics on site.",1451406212

The only reason they aren&#x27;t yet doing this is that it takes some increment of time to get things lined up; funding, customers, propagation of knowledge, etc. But all the pieces are in place.<p>Myostatin or follistatin gene therapy is about as proven as these things get. It exists in heavily muscled natural mutants, including humans (look up brute whippets). Antibody myostatin blockade has just completed phase 2 clinical trials, adding muscle mass to 75 year olds. Chinese labs are turning out myostatin-free dogs. The BioViva CEO organized her own follistatin gene therapy earlier this year in an overseas lab. Five years from now it won&#x27;t take starting a company level of networking to fly somewhere and do this.<p>But myostatin for muscle mass is just the best risk/benefit/knowledge picture out of hundreds of alterations that could in theory now be run up in humans, many of which are high risk in the sense that they&#x27;ve only been tried a few times in mice and not followed for a long time. For example adding additional lysosomal receptors to mice restores liver function in old mice to be the same as in young mice. Increased GDF-11 sends stem cells back to work and improves health in old mice.<p>And so on and so forth. The eager early adopter with a hundred thousand dollars to spend ten years from now could spend the time between now and then mining the research literature and organizing collaborators, making connections with labs overseas and setting up for multiple gene therapies down the line, many of which are associated with interventions shown to delay or turn back specific measures of aging in mice.<p>This isn&#x27;t SENS, it isn&#x27;t repair of underlying damage, but it is a step ahead of what is currently possible.",1451406090

Lack of adequate security on desktops (usually Windows) makes it possible to build large bot networks.<p>Lack of cooperation between ISPs makes it very hard to track down the source of the DOS. Very often the DDOS isn&#x27;t as distributed as it may seem - it can just be a couple of machines on a very well connected network (e.g. a university). But getting a hold of someone in the middle to filter that traffic can take a very long time or be outright impossible. First-responder network engineers (typically referred to as &quot;security&quot;) are overworked and underqualified, and the people who really know their stuff typically can&#x27;t be bothered with silly DOS attacks.<p>We&#x27;ve also observed that (D)DOS&#x27;s happen because of content. Anything political, religious, or whatever other shade of the many things someone out there disapproves of is a potential target for a DOS. Contrary to what you may read in the press, extortion is only a small minority of all DOS attacks out there. We&#x27;ve actually told customers to go away because their content was too DOS-prone.<p>And because these things usually happen across countries, even though they are very real crimes that cause serious damage and cost money, they are hardly ever prosecuted. As the target of a DOS all you want is for it to stop, nobody ever bothers reporting it to the authorities afterwards (because how would you even know who the &quot;authority&quot; is).",1451405664

Whole brain emulation looks much more likely as a road to artificial intelligence; we&#x27;ll start from there and tinker and edit our way to the construction of far greater intelligences.<p>But it is worth thinking about what &quot;tinker and edit&quot; will mean for those entities involved, willingly and otherwise.<p>Consider that at some point in the next few decades it will become possible to simulate and then emulate a human brain. That will enable related technological achievements as reverse engineering of memory, a wide range of brain-machine interfaces, and strong artificial intelligence. It will be possible to copy and alter an individual&#x27;s mind: we are at root just data and operations on that data. It will be possible for a mind to run on computing hardware rather than in our present biology, for minds to be copied from a biological brain, and for arbitrary alterations of memory to be made near-immediately. This opens up all of the possibilities that have occupied science fiction writers for the past couple of decades: forking individuals, merging in memories from other forks, making backups, extending a human mind through commodity processing modules that provide skills or personality shards, and so on and so forth.<p>There is already a population of folk who would cheerfully take on any or all of these options. I believe that this population will only grow: the economic advantages for someone who can edit, backup, and fork their own mind are enormous - let alone the ability to consistently take advantage of a marketplace of commodity products such as skills, personalities, or other fragments of the mind.<p>But you&#x27;ll notice I used what I regard as a malformed phrase there: &quot;someone who can edit, backup, and fork their own mind.&quot; There are several sorts of people in the world; the first sort adhere to some form of pattern theory of identity, defining the self as a pattern, wherever that pattern may exists. Thus for these folk it makes sense to say that &quot;my backup is me&quot;, or &quot;my fork is me.&quot; The second sort, and I am in this camp, associate identity with the continuity of a slowly changing arrangement of mass and energy: I am this lump of flesh here, the one slowly shedding and rebuilding its cells and cellular components as it progresses. If you copy my mind and run it in software, that copy is not me. So in my view you cannot assign a single identity to forks and backups: every copy is an individual, large changes to the mind are equivalent to death, and it makes no sense to say something like &quot;someone who can edit, backup, and fork their own mind.&quot;<p>A copy of you is not you, but there is worse to consider: if the hardware that supports a running brain simulation is anything like present day computers, that copy isn&#x27;t even particularly continuous. It is more like an ongoing set of individuals, each instantiated for a few milliseconds or less and then destroyed, to be replaced by yet another copy. If self is data associated with particular processing structures, such as an arrangement of neurons and their connections, then by comparison a simulation is absolute different: inside a modern computer or virtual machine that same data would be destroyed, changed, and copied at arbitrary times between physical structures - it is the illusion of a continuous entity, not the reality.<p>That should inspire a certain sense of horror among folk in the continuity of identity camp, not just because it is an ugly thing to think about, but because it will almost certainly happen to many, many, many people before this century ends - and it will largely be by their own choice, or worse, inflicted upon them by the choice of the original from whom the copy was made.<p>This is not even to think about the smaller third group of people who are fine with large, arbitrary changes to their state of mind: rewriting memories, changing the processing algorithms of the self, and so on. At the logical end of that road lie hives of software derived from human minds in which identity has given way to ever-changing assemblies of modules for specific tasks, things that transiently appear to be people but which are a different sort of entity altogether - one that has nothing we&#x27;d recognize as continuity of identity. Yet it would probably be very efficient and economically competitive.<p>The existential threat here is that the economically better path to artificial minds, the one that involves lots of copying and next to no concern for continuity of identity, will be the one that dominates research and development. If successful and embedded in the cultural mainstream, it may squeeze out other roads that would lead to more robust agelessness for we biological humans - or more expensive and less efficient ways to build artificial brains that do have a continuity of structure and identity, such as a collection of artificial neurons that perform the same functions as natural ones.<p>This would be a terrible, terrible tragedy: a culture whose tides are in favor of virtual, copied, altered, backed up and restored minds is to my eyes little different from the present culture that accepts and encourages death by aging. In both cases, personal survival requires research and development that goes against the mainstream, and thus proceeds more slowly.<p>Sadly, given the inclinations of today&#x27;s futurists - and, more importantly, the economic incentives involved - I see this future as far more likely than the alternatives. Given a way to copy, backup, and alter their own minds, people will use it and justify its use to themselves by adopting philosophies that state they are not in fact killing themselves over and again. I&#x27;d argue that they should be free to do so if they choose, just the same as I&#x27;d argue that anyone today should be free to determine the end of his or her life. Nonetheless, I suspect that this form of future culture may pose a sizable set of hurdles for those folk who emerge fresh from the decades in which the first early victories over degenerative aging take place.",1451405068

It is, of course, never enough because of the lack of sufficient data or contextual information. Some studies get quite creative in how they find control data. For instance, some take specific events in history, such as the introduction of patent laws (or change in the strength of patent protection for a specific field) in a certain country, and compare various metrics (e.g. derived from industrial data) before and after these events.  Or alternatively they find regimes that are similar in other aspects with the prime difference being in patent laws and they compare metrics across these geopolitical boundaries.

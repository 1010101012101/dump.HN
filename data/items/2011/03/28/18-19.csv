2379559,comment,2378830,2379378,2,0,vietor,,,"> I kind of want to see what other hackers think of this 'heuristic of conversational originalism'.<p>It's a threaded comment system, rather than a flat comment system. To me this implies that the search for context should begin with the most tightly bound scope. By default I assume a comment is a direct reply to its parent, as the writer of the comment made a deliberate choice to place it there.<p>While the larger context informs the tone and examples which will be used, it's the background scenery, not the subject.<p>> In a sustained conversation it's unreasonable to expect readers to perform a context-shift every time someone says something<p>Maybe I'm reading this too strongly, but how else can you have a conversation? Every statement is, most immediately, in the context of the directly preceding statement, that's what a dialog <i>is</i>.<p>> especially when the in-context reading (particularly the murder comment) is more natural than the out-of-context reading.<p>Again, maybe I'm completely misreading you here. But what exactly do you mean by the 'in-context' reading in this case? The subject as I read it was: \n   ""Humans will always be underemployed from some perspective (""Oh but she could be doing X""). Penalizing them for not operating in a way that is consistent with your (or anyone's) world view is far more sinister.""<p>With a larger context of the validity of 'wasting time' as a criticism, the implication that what constitutes a waste of time is purely subjective, and the background example given being HFT vs. Ad revenue. (The choice of HFT as an example being the result of the overall context of the article)<p>As requested, that's what this hacker thinks.",1301338785
2379558,comment,2379067,2379287,1,0,baddox,,,"Python was my second language, after Java. I found the whitespace ""rules"" (I can only think of one) a non-issue, since I always properly indented by Java code anyway. Python just took the indentation that was already there and used it as <i>information</i>.<p>I'm always surprised to see even seasoned programmers attack Python for its whitespace being confusing. The only confusion or problem I can imagine encountering with Python is the spaces vs. tabs debate, and even that is only an issue if you're working with developers who disagree with you on the debate. In a job environment, hopefully there will be a style guide that's accepted and enforced by the developers. Of course, PEP 8 technically settles it for the Python community.",1301338753

2379496,comment,2377154,2379096,1,0,kls,,,"The first part of any security is to figure out what truly need to be protected and focus your efforts on securing those points. That being said the vast majority of web apps have a very small surface of information that someone would look to exploit mainly being credit cards and to a lesser extent personal information. But session is not the solution to fixing that problem, it is merely, again curing the symptom; the cure is to build your web application so that it solicits, transmits uses and disposes of credit card information in a single state transfer.<p>Further if you have a sign up where credit info will be stored you should be using a solution that provides you with a proxy of the numbers collected and not the actual number itself. None of this is fixed by session rather session just allows you to design patterns that take jirations to bolt onto HTTP.<p>As for the transaction data being modified by the client, whether you transmit entire state or snippet of state you have the same issue, at some point if the client is comprised they are comprised you can't secure the client you can only assume that all clients are hostile, session does not fix that fact. In the end, with session based auth, web developers post a form over an SSL connection and receive a proxy ID for that session. If someone hijacks that proxy they become that user, in statless auth you POST some auth info over SSL, if someone hijacks the token they become that user. Session does not make a web application more secure. It just helps developers not think through the ramifications of their design choices. Worse yet it gives developers a false sense of security in which they feel that the information is protected by being in session on the server side, when in fact session hijacking is trivial.",1301337867

Especially not when the site purports to be encouraging an ""enterprise-led recovery"" for the economy<p>They also might take exception to the notion that race-to-the-bottom logo work fits under the site's ""creating a brand"" heading; 99designs is exactly the resource for businesses where <i>visual branding doesn't matter much</i> (which in fairness is a lot of them).",1301337581

Section 4 contained a 'cool' analogy with nothing to do with this programming style (4.1), 'research in progress' with no prototype (4.2), 'belief' (4.3), reference to 'an as yet unpublished paper' (4.3), and related work that should have been given its own section (4.4).<p>Perhaps it's not satisfied to be a position paper and the authors find themselves trying to show off novel research.

(referred to in the papers as ""Sony Japan"").<p>To establish personal jurisdiction over Mr. Hotz, SCEA must show that he had minimum contacts with California such that it makes it fair and reasonable to sue him in that forum <i>over this set of claims.</i> This is so-called ""limited jurisdiction,"" and is to be distinguished from the ""general jurisdiction"" that enables you to sue someone in the state of his residence over any claim whatever (see my mini-primer on the technical aspects of this here: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2335698"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2335698</a>).<p>The key to the limited-jurisdiction analysis here is whether Mr. Hotz ""purposefully directed"" his activities toward California (intending that they have an effect there) <i>in committing the acts for which he was sued</i>. It is not enough to show incidental contacts with the state because such a standard would allow any person to be sued anywhere in the United States over any matter simply for having, e.g., purchased a product from remote state x, or had some similar tangential contact. Remember, the standard requires the court to find contacts in the forum related to the wrongs committed such as to make it reasonable to require the distant defendant to have to defend the suit remotely.<p>Because of this, the vital question concerns the nature of the claims asserted in the lawsuit and whether such claims show that Mr. Hotz intended to affect a California resident in committing the wrongs alleged.<p>And this is where the bombshell comes in: in a forced document production that SCEA managed to stall until just a few days before Mr. Hotz's reply brief was due, it had to produce the key contracts between SCEA and Sony Japan, which contracts conclusively demonstrate that all copyrights that are alleged to have been violated in this case are owned by Sony Japan exclusively and that SCEA has nothing to do with them other than being one of many licensees of such copyrights within the Sony family of companies.<p>In other words, SCEA appears to have nothing legitimate to do with the case other than serving as a proxy by which Sony Japan hopes to bootstrap its way into California jurisdiction. SCEA <i>is</i> connected with the PlayStation Network terms of service having a California forum selection clause. The problem is that none of the claims in this case concern violations of such terms of service.<p>The clear implication is that SCEA is a puppet being used to manipulate the court for Sony's tactical purposes. This is reinforced by several collateral indicators. SCEA filed this suit and ""flooded"" the case with subpoenas that went far beyond the scope of the limited discovery allowed in this sort of case. It then went to great lengths to avoid being straightforward with the court about the copyright ownership upon which the DMCA claims were based. And it has filed a blizzard of affidavits and court papers trying to confuse the main issues in the case.<p>Of course, nothing is completely predictable in a court matter where a court must decide an issue based on a nebulous legal standard such as whether something is ""fair"" or ""reasonable"" under the minimum-contacts jurisdictional analysis. But these revelations, to me, look pretty damning. Essentially, Mr. Hotz's attorneys have provided near-conclusive rebuttals to all of SCEA's jurisdictional claims and left SCEA looking disingenuous. Judges usually do not react well when they come to believe that a party is trying to play them, and this rebuttal does a superb job of showing that that is precisely what SCEA appears to be doing.<p>I would sum this up by saying: if this is all that SCEA has got, it is in trouble on the jurisdictional question (as a fallback, Mr. Hotz's lawyers have also asked that the court be transferred to New Jersey under an ""inconvenient forum"" analysis, which also looks pretty strong for him). It will be interesting to see how this plays out. (The factual details are a bit more complicated than I have summarized them here but this, I think, captures the essence of what is going on - see the wonderful reporting and links of Groklaw to drill down further).",1301336636

Million and billion dollar companies are not going to post their projects on 99designs. I would say it's mostly for mom n pop type small startup businesses. Even if the big guys do use that service, I still don't see any issue with it.<p>I have used 99designs and I didn't like it. My personal opinion, based on my little experience, is it is costly for the services offered. For the record, I have used ODesk, Elance and Freelancer too. When I use these outsourcing sites (including 99designs), I look at both cost and service. Quality, trust, dedication, promptness and professionalism are all part of service. Yes cost is a very important factor. When you have your own business and you need service, like me, you would be looking at these factors carefully too. You look at the service, compare and then you decide on price. It's a capitalistic free economy where no one can dictate a price. Price is dictated by the demands and what the consumers are willing to pay.<p>I will give you a real life example, my example. I needed some graphic designs for my iphone app. I posted the requirements on all 4 sites I mentioned. I received over 200 bids. Bid ranged from $1,800 to $5 (Yes $5!). I carefully verified all of their work/portfolios, exchanged emails and reviewed their responses (learned a lot from this experience, template responses or try to oversell with superlative words, etc.). Out of all, one designer from Argentina caught my attention. She kept telling how much she wanted to design my graphics. She didn't want anything upfront, in fact, she even said she didn't even want any money if I am not satisfied with her work. She gave me a framework on when and how she would submit her work to me for review and if I didn't like the work she would totally redo it. 6 screens with over 40 icons in 3 different resolutions and she was very happy with $238.<p>Cheap or bargain shoppers, yes, these sites are mostly for them but there isn't any site where shoppers will say something like... ""yea, I am willing to pay $10,000 for 6 screens with over 40 icons in 3 different resolutions for my iPhone app."" That doesn't make sense. We have always been creative in this country and we need to be even more creative now. Find ways to deliver quick and more with more options to consumers. If we complain about the labor or other costs, we fail to understand the free market and global economy. It also means we lost the race.",1301336003

There are a lot more intermediate data points, but the underlying rationality (or irrationality) of pricing trends will be the same.<p>Before HFT, it was more likely that a bid/ask spread would be higher ... reflecting the risk aversion of the market making firm... With HFT, that spread decreases b/c the liquidity is offered as part of a small timeframe strategy which may or may not pay off.<p>If you weren't concerned with that short timeframe, then it makes no difference to you whether your order was filled by one party (a traditional market maker) or 100 parties (each a different HFT algorithm).<p>I think to assuage your fear I'd probably just say that it's very difficult to move large numbers of shares at a price that's all that different from the previous price...

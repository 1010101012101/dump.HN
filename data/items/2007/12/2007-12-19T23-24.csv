91316,comment,91106,91277,0,0,ph0rque,,,"In order to compare apples to apples, electric power analysts use the (maximum, I assume; or maybe average) cost per unit of power that can be produced from a given technology. This lets analysts not have to account for the operational efficiencies of the powerplant, solar cell, etc.<p>As far as cloudy days/nighttime, most of the energy use occurs in the afternoon and early evening, when everybody comes home and turns on their stoves, washing/drying machines, TV's, etc. This corresponds to the average peak solar production. So these solar cells would, if they find widespread use, get rid of the need for ""peakers"", which are peak generating units, and are the most expensive in terms of the cost of energy produced.",1198106388

I first encountered PG's essays at a time when I really needed his brand of encouragement. They persuaded me that I wasn't 100% crazy to think I could start a company.

We're looking for angel investors for a while but can't really get connected or referred. It's been more than 8 months since we started working on it. We're close to a private beta, but we can no longer work full-time on it. We just need to get a day time job again to pay rent and food.<p>With $5k we can go full-time again for 2~3 months and finish beta much, much faster.<p>Since we're asking money from you, we have our executive summary, resumes, and a 5-min presentation movie available for download.<p>- Presentation Movie<p>http://bookvair.com/pitch-qt.html<p>- Executive Summary and resumes<p>http://bookvair.com/bookviar_files.zip<p>- Project Page<p>http://bookvair.com<p>
We'd also like to invite contributors to be our first group of users, and give them special deals when we roll out book swapping features.<p>I understand it's not the ""normal"" way to ask money but we're willing to try every way possible to make our website go live.<p>If you have any comments, critics, feel free to post. They are as valuable as money donated.<p>
Thank you very much.<p>Merry Christmas!<p>Leo & Jason<p>sayaww@gmail.com",1198105695

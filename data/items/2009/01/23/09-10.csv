The feeds aren't user specific, are they?<p>If not user specific: user requests feed for xyz.com:  try to pull from cache.  If there's a miss grab the feed from xyz.com, store to cache, and serve (be sure to set cache to expire in however often is necessary).  If cache hit, you're done!<p>You can throw in extras, like make the cache semi fault tolerant by storing the latest feed to a DB.  If your cache ever dies, then you can grab from DB to refill the cache.<p>Beyond that, it's just logging views and subscriptions to feeds.<p>Am I missing something?  I don't actually use feedburner...",1232704601

But that's not me, after 15 years as a professional and two degrees, and I'll wager that's not anyone else reading this either. In my experience, the community around a language trumps all other factors for <i>getting stuff done</i>.",1232704372

(Although it's true that CC-BY isn't really intended for software, it's open-source and IIRC GPL-compatible, so it's plenty good enough for me.  The 4-clause BSD license recommended by the other poster is not GPL-compatible.)<p>AVRs are these fun little cheap microcontrollers; the Arduinos and Chalkroaches, among other things, use them.  Writing enough code to drive a couple of on-board UARTs and switch between some real-time processes on an ATMega AVR would be a thing to do in an evening or a week, not three months.  So three months to do the same thing due to the unnecessary complexities of PC hardware is kind of depressing!  It's a little less depressing if you were only working on it, like, 8 hours a week or something.",1232704314

446196,comment,444804,445869,0,0,jrockway,,,"> Too bad PC gaming is a bit of a dying industry :(<p>This is a good thing for a number of reasons.  One is that there's no need to have Windows around anymore, meaning that home users can switch to something more usable, stable, and secure.  The other is that game companies will only have to test two configurations (Sony and Microsoft), instead of the thousands that they do on PC games.  Less QA grunt work == more features, or faster releases.<p>I'll concede that FPSes suck on consoles, but considering they all have USB, there's no reason why you can't connect a keyboard and mouse to them.",1232702689

The right of free speech certainly includes anonymous speech, and forcing the communications carriers to install bulk snooping gear is a wholesale infringement of this right.<p>Perhaps a better analogy would be forcing all laundromats to install sensors that detect chemical compounds on dirty clothes.",1232702290

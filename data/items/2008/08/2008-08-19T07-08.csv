280172,comment,280028,280028,0,0,agripa,,,"I'd have to agree with other statements here. As a Ph.D student myself, funding varies quite a bit with the field, the university, etc. However, you really shouldn't be worried as a graduate student. Most well-reputed universities guarantee funding for anywhere between 3 to 5 years for Ph.D students, so even if your adviser hits a rough patch, the university/department picks up the slack. Trying to get a tenure-track position in this funding climate is a different matter ;)",1219130406

280159,comment,280016,280016,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"I started off using TypePad, then went to self-hosted MT, and then started a second blog on self-hosted WP. (I also have one on WordPress.com, but I don't recommend that to anyone serious about blogging due to lack of plugins and other advanced functionality.) I think if I were starting another blog today, I might actually go with self-hosted MT.<p>I had my WP blog compromised by a security flaw and then listed as a spam site by Google, meaning that anyone who came there in Firefox (which is most of my readers) got a warning rather than my homepage. Never had that happen with MT.<p>I also had an article take off on StumbleUpon and let's just say Wordpress doesn't handle traffic well. I later tried tossing in the most popular caching plug-in, but it borked my RSS feed such that Feedburner wouldn't recognize it.<p>Long story short, the last 6 months of WP have been nothing but headache after headache for me. I write all of my posts in Word and then publish via xml-rpc, so I don't care much about the interface, but I think MT's and WP's are pretty comparable.<p>So yeah, though a year ago I was considering converting my older blog to WP, now I'd vote for MT. (Haven't used TypePad in years, so I can't tell you about that one specifically.)",1219129338

280154,comment,280118,280118,0,0,gruseom,,,"<i>So what's the best way to work through this book?</i><p>Get a Lisp and fire up the REPL. Type in the expressions as you read and play with variations.<p>I also found it helpful to do the exercises.<p><i>Is there anything I should keep in mind as I delve into functional programming for the first time?</i><p>As you probably know, Lisp isn't a pure functional language. It's its own strange and diverse world. But if you're interested in exploring functional programming in Lisp (a great idea), one important thing is to be aware of when your code has side-effects and get good at eliminating or containing them.<p>Edit: I'd also recommend staying away from CLOS for a while. Not everyone would agree with that. But my experience has been that focusing on built-in data structures and higher-order functions is the best way to learn to program in the functional style. If you're working through ACL, that's the approach you'll be taking anyway.",1219129253

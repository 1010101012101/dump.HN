1994873,comment,1994301,1994640,0,0,kls,,,"The TCK puts restrictions on mobile and I believe server run-times. So basically, it can only be used for desktop development or JVM lite if you will. Given that Java desktop was DOA you can see the usefulness of accepting those restrictions. Oracle as made no secret of their intent to monetize the JVM, there are a good deal of developers that believe that you don't pay to play for technology as low level as a language and run-time. So they are naturally concerned about the manner in which it will be monetized. Looking at the field of use restriction it can serve as an indicator as to where that plan to monetize it. Further with their suite against Google in relation to Android, I bleive that it paints a pretty big bulls eye on where they plan to monetize it. That being said, I have used Java since it was first placed on the net for download, I have seen it fall behind other languages and never once though it was going to die. It had too an extensive of an entrenchment and library available. I personally do believe that this was the death shot and when (I like to think) level headed guys like me, who have always said well it is good enough, sure it not shinny but good enough, start to think that it was the death shot, then it may very well be so.<p>For me personally, if I where asked to throw my lot in with Apache or Oracle, it would be Apache, I use their technology every day, I do a project with Oracle technology (excluding the JVM now) maybe once a year. I think Oracle thinks the entrenchment is to great to overcome, for our sake I hope they are wrong.<p>Fortunately for myself, I was an assembly developer before I was a C developer before I was a Java developer. So my exit, should it become untenable is easy enough given that I am a freelancer. I don't have a significant technology infrastructure investment like product people have. I truly feel for you guys that do, I would be really worried if I where in your shoes.",1292078573
1994872,comment,1993129,1993129,0,0,parasubvert,,," I think you've hit on something very important, essential, in the problem with OO-as-taught.  This is something that is known in many quarters of skillful practictioners, but missed by most schools or beginners.  I think the first part of this article is misleading, in that it waxes philosophical about the drawbacks of defining things in an ontology.   But then it then proceeds to figure out a better way to model things as an ontology!   The issue isn't with ontologies -- yes, slapping a hierarchy or meronymy on something isn't perfect, but it's pretty useful when organizing concepts.<p>The fundamental problem with OO inheritance, is that it is <i>not</i> ontological or mathematical inheritance!  OO inheritance has almost no relationship to thousands of years of what ""is-a"" means -- i.e. subset. It's backwards - subclasses are extensions, or <i>supersets</i> of their parents.<p>The way to implement inheritance correctly is ""specialization by constraint"", i.e. you define a subclass by the constraints it has on its superclass.   This is what's happening in the latter part of the article, with design-by-contract and test cases for your various classes.
This is also, by the way, how ontology languages like OWL work, and in part why they're so hard to learn/use -- their notion of inheritance and ""subclassing"" is the mathematical notion (i.e. more like subset), and the opposite of OO programming languages, so we have 25+ years of history to unlearn.<p>I suspect the reason OO inheritance took the path it did was for simple expediency on the part of compiler writers & language designers.   Specialization by constraint ain't easy to implement declaratively.",1292078569

I'd then progress to starting conversations with people in queues, going to bars on my own and trying to make friends and so on and so forth.<p>I'm very aware that at all points to an outsider I was probably acting a little weird (in the same way that someone learning to rollerskate looks a bit silly), but progressively these tests pushed my boundaries further and further.

This is what I did, and it worked.<p>I assume that you start from 0 friends (I did, since I moved to another country some months ago). Start knowing someone close and easy: classmates, colleagues, occasional acquaintances, but beware not to be stuck with someone as lonely as you. Your objective is to expand from there. You can also go to special events or meetups made for people who want to know other people. Or go to some course for something you like (I dance Tango, for example). Once you know someone, try to go out with these people as much as you can: they will have other friends you can be introduced to.<p>Parties are a good way of doing this. Me and my friends occasionally host dinners or small parties in our houses. People are encouraged to bring new friends, which allows you to know more people. If nobody of your friends organizes some party, start the trend. If you have 3 friends and they bring a new one each, you will be already a group of 7, which is enough for a dinner/small party. Organizing one is really easy, you just need a living room, some snacks/food, some drinks.<p>This will almost solve your loneliness problems from a friends point of view. Members of the other sex specifically are a little more complicated. But if you do as I described above you will definitely be able to know some. After a while you can start going out alone with them. For example, I am dating some girls I met at the tango course and at some party. I know couples who formed this way.",1292077436

Google is successfully commoditizing the mobile OS, lowering costs and driving adoption of smart phones, which drives mobile Internet usage.<p>The carriers and manufacturers are simply being complicity in their own execution in this race to the bottom.

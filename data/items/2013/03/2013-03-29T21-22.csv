I don't think society <i>owes</i> a single one of us anything.  By what possible mechanism could they be said to incur that obligation anyway?<p>Now, you could argue that it's in the best interests of society-as-a-whole to provide those basic affordances, and I think certain results in game-theory would support that argument.  But, to my way of thinking, there's still no reason to <i>expect</i> that ""society"" <i>will</i> guarantee anything for any one individual.<p>Maybe I'm just weird in this regard, but at nearly 40, I'm still unmarried... biggest reason? I grew up dirt poor, never felt like I could afford to start a family, and so never seriously pursued marriage... and I was obsessive about spending my time trying to ramp myself up the socio-economic ladder so that one day I could do things that mattered to me.<p>Now at this age, whether or not I ever do get married is a whole new question, for a variety of reasons.  But the point is, I - for one - never had any expectation that society should provide for me to an adequate level that I could marry and skimp out on hard work.<p>All of that said, I received various random acts of charity throughout my younger years and, looking back on it all, I think I agree with the gist of TFA. Some of those random acts came at critical junctures and probably made a huge difference in me achieving what I have achieved, and me having committed suicide out of despair and depression 20+ years ago.  Somebody gave me a car once, when mine had broken down.  That enabled me to keep working and keep going to school, when the alternative would have been a complete shuddering stop to my progress.<p>But, as appreciated as that was, I appreciate it as a <i>gift</i> and see no reason to believe that anybody owed me that.",1364594390

For all you know, it could take forever. 10 minutes is the average.<p>> What am I supposed to present to the user during this time? Am I supposed to tell them that their payment may or may not have been accepted, please check back in ten minutes or wait for an email?<p>That person is paying you with Bitcoins. They already have an idea of what a network confirmation is. Tell them you're waiting for N network confirmations. Send them an email when the transaction is verified by your node, and a second email when the transaction has enough network confirmations.<p>> How would you handle this if it were a real person in a real store, at a register checking out?<p>It depends on what you're doing. If it were a Starbucks, for example, I would serve the coffee right away, without waiting for blockchain verification. It's unlikely that someone who has more than 50% of the Bitcoin network is using that massive power to double-spend on a Chai Tea Latte.<p>If I needed more confirmation, I could send the transaction to some trusted miner nodes, and see if there's consensus. If those nodes say they will include the transaction in their next mined block, then I can close the deal without waiting for the blockchain to verify it. Of course, this can be done automatically.",1364594294

5463231,comment,5456819,5459896,4,0,lsc,,,"meh, it's hard.   First prerequisite to effective DDoS mitigation?  you need to have enough capacity (in terms of upstream transit/peering ports) to absorb the whole attack.   If not?  it's over, you blackhole the target at your upstream's routers (and thus throw out the baby)  and the attack ends, or you don't, and your service is dead for all customers.<p>That's why I don't advertise any sort of ""DoS protection""  - I know that attacks that are bigger and badder than my network are fairly common.  This is also why I'm not going to take any promises of DoS mitigation from anyone who doesn't have a terrifyingly huge network seriously.<p>Now, once you have enough upstream port capacity to soak the attack, you then filter the good traffic from the bad.   This is a whole 'nother can of ""very hard""  but it's easy compared to getting the capacity in the first place.    Note, this filtering becomes /way/ easier if you have some idea of the sort of traffic you are expecting, but it's still difficult.<p>There are ""clean pipes"" services that claim to do this for you, with varying degrees of credibility.  The thing is,  CloudFair is one of the smaller companies to offer this.   I was looking at the offering from level3, (in my mind, considering their network capacity, probably the most credible provider of such a service.  Also, their service claimed to work with all traffic, not just http and the like, so it would work for me.)  but it sounded like the price was somewhere along the lines of ""give us 25% of your revenue, and we'll give you half the cleaned capacity you need.""    I mean, even the regular level 3 bandwidth is between one and two orders of magnitude more expensive than the cogent/he.net mix that is common in my industry, so uh, yeah.  I didn't spend the requisite six months with the salesman to get the real price, but I think ""more than I can afford"" is a likely guess.<p>I mean, the idea here, usually, is that the network providing this service is large enough that it has a whole bunch of peering connections and can filter the incoming traffic fairly close to the source.  Even if you've got hundreds of gigabits of capacity at one location, if it's all at that one location, it's very likely that something else is going to gum up the works between, say Austria and you.  If you've got a giant, global network, though, your traffic from Austria goes to your POP in Austria, where you can filter the ""bad"" traffic (assuming you figured out how to do that.)<p>And really, you don't have to filter /all/ the attack traffic, just enough that the target isn't completely overwhelmed.   Like spam-filtering or anything else, nothing is 100%.<p>And that's how most of the low-end hosting world feels about it.  The upshot is that we throw out the baby;  the small customer who gets hit repeatedly by large DDoS attacks, generally speaking, has to change to a different provider, 'cause they get kicked off.  I mean, if you are paying someone $20/month, and your enemies take that service down hard?  yeah, after the problem is fixed, you are very likely to need to find a new provider.",1364593989

""Never""? Quite the opposite. Gold was seized by Roosevelt with Executive Order 6102 to prevent people from using gold as a currency. Nixon pulled the dollar off the gold standard in 1971 as the US Treasury didn't have enough gold to finance the war in Vietnam, and he feared a run on the banks. On both those occasions, people wanted to get into gold, but the government prevented them from doing so. And today physical gold has been bought by millions of people as a hedge against the world financial crisis.<p>On these occasions and more people would use gold as a currency if they weren't prevented by law (= men with guns) from doing so; this is the opposite of the claim that ""gold has never really been selected by free markets"".<p><pre><code>  imperial governments with big war machines minted gold

Speaking of counterfactual claims, the war machine is actually powered by printing money. The reason Nixon got the US off the gold standard was to print money to finance the Vietnam War.

Moreover, I hope you will agree that people with similar conventional beliefs on inflation & economics are in power, and the world economy is not doing very well. FWIW, here's a first cut at separating statements of opinion & fact to drill down to potential empirical differences.<p><pre><code>  That money exists to serve as an improved barter good,   
  rather than barter being a degenerate form of trade that 
  exists mostly in the rare cases when credit is 
  impractical.
</code></pre>
Not sure about your disagreement here - are you saying that credit is more fundamental than barter? Money as an improved replacement for barter is hardly controversial. Credit is a third layer on top of money, which only comes into play when there are actual goods to be traded.<p><pre><code>  That quantity fixation or durability are 
  particularly important properties of money.
</code></pre>
If you care about money as a long-term store of value, these are important characteristics. Paper notes from most countries that existed in the 1800s don't hold their value today. Gold coins do.<p><pre><code>  That gold is particularly important, versus 
  anything else that is pretty and value-dense.
</code></pre>
Gold is important because it can't be mined as easily as paper is printed, and because it's an element and thereby difficult to truly counterfeit without an atom smasher. As such it limits the spending power of governments. It's also important for the same reason any network effect is important, namely other people use it (and have used it since historical times).<p><pre><code>  That the only forms of money are commodity-backed and pure 
  fiat.
</code></pre>
This is possibly a factual disagreement. But either a paper note is exchangeable for a fixed quantity of a commodity like gold or it isn't. I suppose you can have some limits on redemption on a daily basis, but otherwise it seems like a reasonable boolean distinction. Please do elaborate on what you have in mind.<p><pre><code>  That the USD switched from the first camp to the other in 
  1971.
</code></pre>
This also seems to be a factual claim. The US under Nixon did indeed abandon the gold standard fully in 1971, removing the $35 dollars per ounce peg (<a href=""http://www.theatlanticwire.com/politics/2011/08/nixon-gold-standard-gamble-interrupting-bonanza/41278"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theatlanticwire.com/politics/2011/08/nixon-gold-s...</a>). Most people both pro- and con- would refer to this as ""going off the gold standard"".<p><pre><code>  Describing the USD without reference to the Federal 
  Reserve at all.
</code></pre>
I think that's implicit. Not sure this is a ""common error"".<p><pre><code>  The assumption that the debasement of coins over a 300 
  year period had any harmful effects other than making the 
  coins less pretty 1700 years later.
</code></pre>
This is not an assumption but is explicitly argued. The underlying thesis is that governments that debase their currency by printing money eventually find their ability to compel obedience waning, as their official scrip is rendered useless.<p><pre><code>  That +200% wage and price inflation over 130 years is any 
  kind of serious problem.
</code></pre>
Given that this period coincides with the decline and ultimate fall of the Roman Empire, I wouldn't call this a ""common error"" either.<p><pre><code>  That hyperinflation and regular inflation are the same 
  thing except in degree.
</code></pre>
This claim is not made in the slides. But both of them do have the property in common that one's currency becomes less valuable. ""Normal"" inflation has devalued the US dollar 23.45X since 1913 (roughly $1 in 1913 buys $23.45 today; see usinflationcalculator.com). If that happened in one year we'd call it extremely strong inflation, if not hyperinflation.<p><pre><code>  That Bitcoin limiting supply controls inflation.
</code></pre>
Please give a counterargument here. How can you inflate a currency if the supply is fundamentally limited?<p><pre><code>  That the problems with deflation are somehow non-obvious 
  or not happening observably in Bitcoin right now.
</code></pre>
What are the problems? A rise in market cap to $1B over four years from nothing and adoption by millions in the face of government opposition looks like a smashing success. Fluctuations aren't unilateral seizures; everyone in Bitcoin has chosen to be in Bitcoin.<p><pre><code>  That flat-rate Demurrage fixes Bitcoin inflation.
</code></pre>
I suppose you mean ""fixed Bitcoin deflation""? Freicoin may not ""fix"" deflation but it's a currency which has regular inflation built into it. Because Kyle supports deflation he certainly did not claim that Freicoin is a ""fix"", but rather a technical embodiment of an alternate philosophy.<p>In short, I think most of the points you raise are not ""common errors"" but rather (at best) disagreements of opinion.

5463054,comment,5462087,5462618,4,0,ANTSANTS,,,"Literally, yes. It's arguably much more readily apparent that code is just data when programming in assembly than in any other environment. It's all bytes, and you're forced to accept that from day 1.<p>You aren't going to have the expressiveness that a Lisp provides available to you, but self-modifying code and macros assemblers are common in some assembly programming scenes. Anything to save a few bytes or cycles. I'm a little rusty, but here's a basic example off the top of my head (sorry, wall of text incoming):<p>Functional programmers are familiar with the concept of ""map,"" an operation that applies a function to every element in a list or what have you. Let's say I'm programming in 6502 assembly, and I have a little function that adds an amount to every byte in a page (or every byte in some particular 256 bytes). Let's say you also want a similar function that instead multiplies each byte by two (just a single left shift), or masks some bits off with a bitwise AND, or whatever. It would look something like this:<p>store zero in X register, add constant to the memory at the address (some constant address + value in X register), increment X, branch back to the adding part if the zero flag is not set (ie, loop until X overflows to 0), then return to wherever we called this function from.<p>You could write a handful of these almost identical subroutines, with the only real difference being the single opcode that reads, modifies, and rewrites each byte... or you could just rewrite the opcode at runtime!<p>Now, your add-to-page, multiply-page, mask-out-page, and any similar functions all share a little block of code that you can think of as ""their map,"" and the actual functions you call initially could look something like this:<p>Write the constant for the relevant opcode to the instruction in map you want to replace ($7D for ADC absolute,X on the 6502), and jump to the map subroutine.<p>That's a bit of a contrived example, but in a routine with a more complicated access pattern, it might really make a difference in byte savings: Imagine a routine that clips offscreen entities in a game, that calculates something like ""if their X coordinate is below or above some value, they disappear for now. If their Y coordinate is below some value, they fell into a pit and died."" You could reuse a lot of the general logic for checking the left edge of the screen for the other two edges, just by rewriting a constant and instruction or two.<p>A perhaps more readily useful example is rewriting ""constant"" addresses. How would we rewrite our above ""map"" routine to modify arbitrary pages, and not just one in particular? We could store the address of the page we want to modify in memory, and use an indirect addressing mode for add. Indirect addressing modes of instructions do something like this: Load two bytes from some address in memory, and treat that as the address we want to operate on. Problem is, this indirect address mode adds two cycles to every operation we perform when compared to the original constant-address map. Suddenly, we're wasting over 500 cycles per map!<p>The solution is instead to treat the ""constant"" address in the instruction stream of the map routine as your address variable. Just rewrite those two bytes during your ""function prologue,"" and voila, you have a general-purpose map routine that only uses half-a-dozen cycles or so more than one that only worked on a certain page.<p>The part I've been leaving out is using assembler macros to automate a lot of this stuff for you. Again, I'm rusty, and I never got all that experienced in writing macros, but someone could very easily write themself a macro (if they're using a powerful macro assembler, like ca65) that takes a single argument, the instruction you want to execute in your map, and generates for that stub subroutine that replaces the opcode for them. I found simpler macros to be more useful in everyday code, though: you make a macro that fills in a gap in the 6502's instruction set, like performing arithmetic between the accumulator and index registers, or basic 16-bit arithmetic, and from then on, you can pretend that the CPU had those instructions all along.<p>I may have only used these techniques for shaving bytes and cycles off of straightforward routines, but in some ways, going from writing 6502 assembler to writing C, Lua, and JavaScript actually feels like a <i>step back</i> in terms of expressiveness, even if they are certainly more productive languages in actuality, and first-class functions/function pointers cover much of the most practical (and least dangerous) use-cases for self-modifying code. I suppose I won't get that feeling back until I set some time aside to really learn a Lisp.",1364591327

There are also possible use cases with lazy-loading libraries for load times, or only loading scripts on certain pages.<p>Does the whole-program compiling approach mean that I would have to import whole libraries into my own project in order to use them, and that I can only deploy single script files? How does the whole-program approach interact with event handlers embedded in HTML, which it would not have visibility into?<p>I would expect that some of these restrictions could maybe be eased in a native-Dart client. But given that for the foreseeable future most Dart projects will have to target non-Dart-enabled clients, in practical terms Dart as a whole will have to be shackled to any limitations in Dart2JS. I'm curious what your thoughts on this are and if you have any plans to address it.",1364591178

That iOS became and remains a gaming powerhouse is a happy accident that happened more because gaming companies adapted to Apple, rather than Apple making any concessions to the 'needs' of traditional gaming.<p>Nothing about Apple's potential ability to leverage the AppleTV into a living-room juggernaut is new.  You could've (and many have) made the same observation every single year since Apple announced they were going to allow native app development on the iPhone.<p>Yet Apple continues to ignore this opportunity, I believe, for the same reason they've largely ignored traditional gaming on desktop macs for so long: they don't <i>get</i> gaming.  Not as something that's worthwhile in and of itself.  And they don't seem to care to.  They certainly aren't willing to commit serious effort into addressing gaming-specific concerns.<p>Popular history has it that Jobs didn't want to do the iPad unless it was good for something other than surfing the internet on the toilet.  I'm wondering if Apple's minimum bar for apps on the AppleTV isn't ""it has to be good for something other than playing games"".<p>Because they've been capable of putting out a hell of a gaming device for five years.  But a good input method for controlling more-general software, on a large screen, several feet away, remains largely unexplored and unclear.<p>So what if Apple's lack of movement on this front has more to do with their focus being on that unexplored territory, rather than having been too-distracted to release a Wii-knockoff controller and AppleTV SDK?<p>Given Apple's history, they'd build <i>everything</i> about such a general platform around that input method. [1] And maybe some new dedicated-style of gaming tags along, with devs making brand new games that lend themselves to this input method. [2]<p>And it would be very unlike Apple to present it the other way around: releasing a traditional games-centric controller, thus requiring non-game apps and users to deal with D-pads and analog sticks.<p>I think that when Jobs' biographer quoted him as saying he 'finally cracked it', Jobs wasn't talking about their having cracked the video-content problem for AppleTV [3].  He was talking about the input problem for more-general couch computing.<p>And that's why I think apps and games are almost certainly coming, but a gamepad isn't.<p>[1] Touch for mobile wasn't just about using taps in place of mouse-clicks; everything about the UI revolved around <i>tactile response</i>. UI panes were <i>dragged</i> out and <i>swiped</i> away.  Views were zoomed with (un)pinches and rotated with twists.<p>[2] Not unlike the way native-touch gaming was forced to spring up, to deliver great experiences on iOS, rather than Apple adding traditional controls to enable the straightforward creation of traditional games.<p>[3] How to get all the content providers to agree to an iTunes-style, user-friendly, integrated interface; rather than insisting on their silos and cable TV subscriptions.",1364591138

That is unfortunate because there are principles of monetary policy (like how much currency is in circulation) which are being conflated with currency issues (like how hard it is to counterfeit).<p>Bitcoin is a currency, which through a number of exchanges, can be exchanged for money. Because it is not legal tender for any economy, its economic value is entirely controlled by currency exchange. That will always makes it <i>less stable</i> than currencies that are backed by an economic entity (a nation-state, or perhaps at some point a multi-national corporation).<p>This is important to consider because currencies that <i>are</i> backed by an economic entity are only as strong as that entity is with respect to the global economy. That is why the Italian Lire tended to hyper-inflate but the Euro does not. The difference is that the Eurozone economy is stronger than the Italian economy by itself is.<p>I can whole heartedly recommend that people interested in Bitcoin visit the British Museum's display of the history of currency, and to invest in understanding the reasoning that economists go through in order to make the statements they make.

It is designed to work just like other currencies do. The idea that Bitcoin is some kind of scam comes from ignorance on the topic of mediums of exchange. This talk was my attempt at showing how all currencies work, so that you can compare Bitcoin to all other currencies, and see that similarity.<p>- You are correct that it is not designed to be a stable store of value. Gold shares a similar problem. Price stability is probably not going to be one of Bitcoin's strong suits, for sure. It's primary role might be simply as a highly liquid store of value that cannot easily be controlled by a central authority, which is still incredibly profound.<p>- A lot of things caused the fall of the Roman empire. I don't see devaluation of Roman currency as -the- reason, but I do see it was major component. It's pretty hard to run a stable empire when economic exchange breaks down.<p>- Regarding Rothbard: I am not an Austrian (school of economics). I like a lot of their older macroeconomic works, but I think that the school has (in the last 30ish years) been hijacked by hard-core libertarians to justify things that I would never agree with. There are some things that markets seem to do a worse job at than governments, and as a citizen with access to clean drinking water, I am perfectly comfortable with that compromise.<p>- I think the ""jury is still out"" as to whether it will be a better store of value to the US Dollar. But the store of value of the USD is simply that our government exists, and is stable. And I don't know if you've paid attention to the recent ineptitude (like the fiscal cliff), but it's not a strong vote of confidence. That's the question: Do you believe more in your government, or in a predictable, documented software algorithm? Either could fail. We'll find out which fails first.",1364590870

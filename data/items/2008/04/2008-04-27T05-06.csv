Lots of clicky buttons and a small area where you type your program is their idea of perfection.<p>Emacs takes the opposite approach (a black screen where you type stuff) and apparently this annoys some people.

174711,comment,174572,174572,0,0,martythemaniak,,,"I worked for RIM in 2005/2006 and the entire time every company under the sun was coming out with a ""BlackBerry Killer"". It was supposed to be the Treo, Good Technology, Moto's Q9, WinMo with active sync, Nokia E60 etc etc. During the entire time sales kept growing steadily at around 25% a quarter.<p>So the iPhone is just the latest one of these and things will turn out as before. For example, sales of the BB have been very strong since the iPhone launched and even exceeded analyst expectations in Q4 and that's unlikely to change.<p>Look at it this way - when the BlackBerry came out in 99, RIM had around 100 poeple and sold 25000 devices. Now they're one of Canada's largest companies by market cap, have thousands of employees and sell millions of devices per quarter.<p>So what I'm really saying is: no worries. They've got plenty of good people working there, the CxOs are competent and they'll do well.",1209275396

Some of them have the equivalent of a self-destruct clause that can be triggered by taking just one semester off.  In order to take a NASA internship for one semester, I had to get approval all the way to the top of the chain (president of the university) or I would have permanently lost my tuition scholarship.  As it was, although I had administrative approval, when I came back the <i>computer</i> system automatically marked me as a ""dropout"" and I was blocked out of most log-ins.

174682,comment,174126,174126,0,0,phaedrus,,,"About time!  As Alex Papadimoulis explained when he (briefly) changed the name of  The Daily WTF to ""Worse Than Failure"", the problem is not just that so many software projects fail, it's that so many are passed off as a ""success"" just because they are finished, even if they don't work.  That's ""worse than failure"" because at least you learn from failures.<p>I think the free market could curb the ""software quality problem"" but only if software companies are held accountable.  If there were more awareness among software customers of the low quality of most software written, and a potential that a software company gets the bejeebus sued out them for shoddy work, then there are several good things would come of it:  1.  Companies producing shoddy software would go out of business instead of scamming their way along.  2. When their asses are on the line, maybe they'll start demanding some quality before quantity.  3. Maybe we'll finally see a state or national licensing requirement for programmers, like there is for nurses and doctors.",1209272714
174681,comment,174575,174575,0,0,jrockway,,,"I'm not sure why he thinks literate programming source code is hard to parse.  I would just implement it like this; normal text is normal text, program text is indented two spaces.  Example:<p>This is a super-fun algorithm.  It is a function of super-fun-arguments, a list.<p><pre><code>  (defun super-fun-algorithm (&rest super-fun-arguments)
</code></pre>
We start by parsing the super-fun-arguments into lists of foobars.  See page 1234 for the parse-into-foobars utility function.<p><pre><code>    (let ((foobars (parse-into-foobars super-fun-arguments)))
</code></pre>
OK, I'm bored now.  But this is only tedious because I'm writing about irrelevant details (we all know what <i>defun</i> does, after all).",1209272606

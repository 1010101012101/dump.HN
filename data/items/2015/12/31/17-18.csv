10818732,comment,10812961,10812961,0,0,civilian,,,"I remember reading an Arthur C. Clarke book where a space liner has lost their engines and their airlocks. The protagonist on the military rescue ship decides to do something drastic: blow up the space liner.<p>They seal the people into groups of 20 in separate cabins, and then they detonate small charges to puncture each cabin at a time. Their ship is positioned right next to the liner, with utility cords leading straight to the airlock. Clarke took this opportunity to explain that you don&#x27;t freeze and explode in space, losing oxygen is the main problem.

That&#x27;s due to the same precedent the media should be all over: J Edgar Hoover. Hoover pushed for greater power for FBI, including surveillance, to combat the communist threat. They encouraged people everywhere to tip them off with innocent people often being harassed. Sound familiar post-9/11?<p>Anyway, Hoover decided surveillance power had a better use: digging up dirt on politicians, media people, judges, whoever. This was back when FBI agents had to physically tap phone wires or sit outside your house. Nonetheless, with very little capabilities, he got enough dirt to blackmail Congress into increasing his power and reign for decades. So, one person already took control of Congress via unlawful use of surveillance.<p>Now, we have an agency that can spy on everyone and everything simultaneously with algorithms looking for juiciest tidbits? And Congress doesn&#x27;t see how this could be bad for them? Even one rogue group with unlogged access to the collection tech could get enough dirt on key committees probably in weeks to months. Whole NSA could be honest except them and still a huge threat to democracy.<p>This is why I argue that we need to push Congress and business elites to roll back government surveillance while constantly reminding them of J Edgar Hoover precedent. I was sure they&#x27;d be spying on at least some of Congress. Articles like this only make our claims stronger. Keep asking them if they want to be working for NSA employees with copies of incriminating messages, photos, or meetups?

It works like Bundler where it finds a single set of package versions that satisfy all of the constraints and there are no duplicate packages.<p>Constraint solving is the status quo, and I am strongly opposed to it.  Rather than saying &quot;I want foo >= 1.0&quot; in a package manager, you should have the build system test the environment for the features you need. This is what the Autotools and other build systems that have been around for decades do.  This way, the project isn&#x27;t tied to a single package manager and, in the case of free software, greatly eases the burden on package maintainers that want to add your software to their distribution.<p>Functional package management doesn&#x27;t need constraint solving because every package in the system <i>precisely</i> describes itself: exactly which dependencies are needed for build-time and runtime (which precisely describe themselves, recursively, all the way down to libc), precisely which source code (tarball/directory/whatever + checksum), and the exact build script that turns that source code into a (hopefully bit-reproducible) binary.  There&#x27;s no constraint solving to determine what the dependency tree is, it&#x27;s already been encoded in the package objects themselves.  This is what any robust package manager should enable, but the only two that I know of that do this are Nix and GNU Guix.<p>>The problem then is now your language has a dependency on an outside package manager, one which is often OS specific. Most modern languages need to support a variety of OSes.<p>A programming language should not depend on any specific package manager.  This is what build systems are for!  More and more language communities conflate the two, but this is a huge mistake that we are paying for by making our software nearly impossible to reproduce from source code. [0]  Everyone just uses pre-built binaries full of circular dependencies and reproducibility issues because things are so tangled that no one actually knows how to build anything from source anymore.<p>I think the value of language-specific package managers lies in providing an easy way to fetch pure (no native code) modules to faciliate simple code sharing and helping newcomers get bootstrapped quickly.  However, for serious software development and deployment they are terrible and we desperately need better tools.

Met a lot of developers. We were a tinge more numerous -compared to the era and time- freaks among freaks.<p>The number of schyzophrenic, LGBT, psychotics, diabetics, aspergers, autists ... outcasts of the society were high 15 years ago. Not all outcasts I will admit. Highly educated ones. Nerds, and geeks like with the true meaning of geeks before silicon valley in a 1984 fashion made it sound cool.<p>The bullied at school because of invisible differences. At least when you are visibly different you are not alone.<p>Free software was our haven, a community with strong bonds. I never met him though.<p>Since linux became &quot;hype&quot; the community has changed. Less freaks, more suits and ties more &quot;opening to visible diversities&quot; but in depth less tolerance towards the differences of the minds.<p>I am uneasy with the deleting of his posts *. Even though I guess I understand the family. There are so many ways people can be misleaded by his lasts words. Me included.<p>His lasts words are stinking of loneliness and oddity for me, though. Like a bottle to the sea.<p>I wish to try to open gently this bottle.<p>Whatever he wishes to have uncovered my clueless guess is the true nature of facing a world that is violent with a difference and a lack of empathy. Like a psychopathic society. He may not have been a &quot;nerd&quot; or &quot;geek&quot; or bullied at school but he seems to have died like one.<p>His tweets were long enough before his death. Thousands of people made the news seeable on the internet. Their was time to act. Yet, like for any freaks on the streets that every one sees and have empathy for, every one seemed concerned and no one acted. Liking on fb, talk on TED, news on HN are effectless in the real life.<p>What I see from the reactions to his last words is ... people are more concerned about being &quot;correct&quot; above all.<p>I also see his social shell cracking revealing his inner self. I see people close to him more concerned about keeping a nice image of him rather than accepting who he was. As a human. To fail is human, to err is human, to cry is human, to be in pain is human.<p>But the dark secrets is we all are freaks. And we face our fears and demons -- alone sometimes. Especially when being bullied. Society tends to blame the victims of bullying for their own weaknesses.<p>As soon as you call for help when fighting your daemons in your own honest language people walk away, by fear, of what? Contamination? Conflict?<p>My sympathy goes to Ian. My feeling goes to all the people asking for help that are ignored, but for which we make nice posts, hoping someone else will take care of it. (NIB)<p>I am even feeling myself both a jerk and wishing to respect his lasts words[1] writing this.<p>Maybe the only thing that we have to look at is at the bottle, and not open it.<p>A bottle to the sea is a signal to the world, and some are trying to hide this bottle.<p>In fact, I cowardly will not open the bottle. But I see it. I have the feeling it is important to not negate it.<p>&quot;i have many stories to tell and do not want them to die with me&quot; he said.<p>In my point of view not respecting someone&#x27;s last world is like breaking a geas that bound generations.<p>What if no one respected the last wishes of Nicolai Copernicus on publishing is thesis?<p>sapere auso[2].<p>It is our moral contract to the one who passed away to respect their last wishes, else what will remain of us after our own deaths?<p>He was a human, he was in pain, he was alone, and that how he died, unable to tell his stories. And even as a complete stranger, I feel for him.<p>Maybe he was living in delusion. Maybe he was crazy. Maybe he had terrible stories to tell about DSA-1571-1. It is impossible for me to guess the stories he actually wishes to make the front page of HN.<p>I just read his words and see the pain of a human and respect them as is.<p>Let&#x27;s respect the true memory of a man and respect his real last words, not the façade that is given to us.<p>[1] yes I assume this is him writing.

Some of it is contextual though, right?<p>If I were to walk up to one of my neighbors in my little suburban, sidewalked neighborhood with a shotgun, even muzzle-up leaned on my shoulder, that would be atypical for this community, and I agree that would absolutely be interpreted as aggressive, escalating, etc., in this context. I would certainly be leery of a neighbor walking around holding a gun.<p>However, I grew up in a farming community. It was common to see people driving pickups with guns mounted on a rack in the back of the cab. It was common to see teenagers (myself included) exploring the woods by our house with a .22 rifle hanging from their shoulder or strapped to their bicycle as they rode past our house. If you bumped into a neighbor at the edge of your land, there was a (estimating here) 20% chance they&#x27;d have a rifle on them. My point is just that guns were prevalent in that context. So, carrying a gun in that context is not the same as brandishing it (technically to hostilely shake or wave) or indicating that you&#x27;re ready to shoot someone.<p>EDIT: But yes, walking up to strangers on your land carrying a gun does carry an implied threat.

10818537,comment,10803140,10816530,0,0,tel,,,"&quot;Initial&quot; usually means &quot;the initial algebra over a functor&quot;. This means that for some functor f the algebra `i : f (Initial f) -> Initial f` is initial in the category of f algebras. This means that for any X and `g : f X -> X` there&#x27;s a universal function `universal g : Initial f -> X` such that `g . fmap (universal g) = universal g . i` at type `f (Initial f) -> X`. Or, we have a function<p><pre><code>    universal : (f x -> x) -> (Initial f -> x)\n</code></pre>\nand we can actually define Initial in this way<p><pre><code>    universal&#x27; : Initial f -> (f x -> x) -> x\n\n    newtype Initial f = Initial { universal&#x27; :: forall x . (f x -> x) -> x }\n</code></pre>\nIn &quot;strict Haskell&quot; where we can act only finitely, we construct values of `Initial f` only by slapping finitely many layers of `f` on top of one another. For instance, when `f` is `data ConsF x = NilF | ConsF Int x` we can make a list [1, 2, 3] like<p><pre><code>    Initial $ \join -> \n      let nil   = join NilF\n          a : x = join (ConsF a x)\n      in 1 : 2 : 3 : nil\n</code></pre>\nIn other words, Initial things are described by their construction.<p>Clearly, this relates directly to initial objects constructed via, e.g., Free, since it does roughly the same thing. Free emphasizes the notion of layering things atop one another. In Lazy Haskell we can still use this layering to construct non-initial objects (more to come below) but if Free were transported to Strict Haskell it would clearly only construct initial things.<p>---<p>So what about Finally Tagless?<p><pre><code>    class List l where\n      nil :: l\n      cons :: Int -> l -> l\n</code></pre>\nWe&#x27;re still going to be constructing values of `List l => l` by application of finite layers! If anything, we&#x27;re more stuck to this process now.<p><pre><code>    cons 1 (cons 2 (cons 3 nil))) :: List l => l\n</code></pre>\nIf we swap this out for explicit dictionary passing we can see that we&#x27;re missing an argument like<p><pre><code>    data ListD l = ListD { nil :: l, cons :: Int -> l -> l }\n\n    \d -> cons d 1 (cons d 2 (cons d 3 nil)) :: ListD l -> l\n</code></pre>\nand also that `ListD l` is equivalent to `ConsF l -> l`. It&#x27;s really the same thing as the free method and is again operating initially.<p>---<p>So what does it take to make something &quot;final&quot;? A final coalgebra of `f` would be an object `i : Final f -> f (Final f)` such that for any X and coalgebra `g : X -> f X` we have `universal g : X -> Final f` such that `i . universal g = fmap (universal g) . g` at type `X -> f (Final f)`. Or,<p><pre><code>     universal : (x -> f x) -> x -> Final f\n</code></pre>\nwhich again can be used to define `Final f`<p><pre><code>    data Final f where\n      Final :: (x, x -> f x) -> Final f\n</code></pre>\nNo longer can we define things by how they are constructed, now we must define them by how they are <i>viewed</i>. This opens up the doors to new kinds of structures, even in &quot;Strict Haskell&quot;<p><pre><code>    natsFrom :: Int -> Final ConsF\n    natsFrom n0 = Final (n0, \n -> ConsF n (natsFrom (n + 1)))</code></pre>",1451582565

Also if that is written to the contract as a formula it is a huge reason to lay off old employees, because as the company grows one expects the MM to grow larger. If it isn&#x27;t written into the contract it is a crappy way to reward the initial brave few as initial revenue will be negligible and their share will decrease as the company grows.",1451581361

The bytes-received is solved by simply starting with some padding, and unless you need framing you might find it simpler to just use XMLHttpRequest directly.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/eventsource/basics/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/eventsource/basics/</a>",1451581331

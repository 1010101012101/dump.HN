Please note my response to a similar comment below: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5416724"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5416724</a><p>You're right that the logo is not <i>only</i> below the fold. There is a dimmed version in the top right corner, but the point where I really introduce the app is below the fold. I admit that the title is slightly inaccurate because of that. It just made for a snappier headline.<p>The main point is to place the logo low on the visual hierarchy. The dimmed logo you are referring to is not very obvious. Visitors will read the headline before they see it.<p>Also note, everyone is noticing that occurrence of the logo right away because I explicitly point out the prominence/location of the logo in the post. If you were visiting the site without that context, you wouldn't notice the dimmed logo.",1363888786

5417390,comment,5406732,5413931,1,0,xaritas,,,"Good questions. I fully support DOM Spaghetti Aversion, but Angular's approach is quite different from PHP. I'd hate for people to dismiss it because they heard its the new PHP or because it cosmetically resembles an anti-pattern.<p>To answer your specific concerns, you can in fact imperatively bind Angular controllers to route views in the app's configuration block. However, this approach doesn't always make senseyou can have multiple apps in a page, each app having multiple controllers, so they can't all use the URL as the engine of application state. In cases like this you can your view as a directive, and then you can inject the appropriate controller (in fact this is exactly how ng-view works with the router).<p>Or, you can take the approach quoted above, and use an XML-like declarative configuration language to describe the view and its relationship to whatever happens to be its controller, and let the compiler generate the appropriate HTML for you. (I'm kidding, it's HTML all the way. But in Angular, the view describes its own structure, appearance and behavior, the controller is concerned with mutating state and not DOM manipulation.)<p>I'm not trying to evangelize, just put some good information out there. Backbone's templates, as I recall, use ERB-style syntax to push values and imperative code into templates, which then set up their models (<a href=""http://backbonejs.org/#FAQ-bootstrap"" rel=""nofollow"">http://backbonejs.org/#FAQ-bootstrap</a>).

But honestly, you could fix it 100%, and it would still be easier to develop native apps on iOS/Android. 280 North's Slides for example as a great example of what you could do, but let's not kid ourselves, it was also pretty slow.<p>If you look at the herculean efforts the Google Docs team went through to get that running fast, and it's still not fast enough, I'd say there's there a lot more work do be done on the Web-as-app-UI-renderer model side.<p>If it weren't for all of the other things you'd have to reinvent, and what you'd lose from indexability and transparency, I'd almost say built a framework on using WebGL rendering.",1363888405

Thousands of women were listed who had liked ""Running"". Too easy? I quickly messaged five of the women who caught my eye. Days passed, no replies. I wonder if these women saw the message or if it was lost in their  ""Other"" folder. I was not about to pay $1 to have it sent to their inbox. On the 5th day a girl replied. In the next hour since I got her response: We talked on fb, I gave her my number, we texted, talked on the phone, and then she asked to meet me the next night. When she asked how I found her I said the creepy new fb graph search. She said that it was really creepy that I messaged her like that and that normally she'd never reply to a message from a stranger.<p>I met this girl the following night at Starbucks followed by a bite to eat. We talked about what to do next. She started to list off options and said the magic ""watch a movie"" line so I jumped on that. Shortly after we were on my couch at my place. I don't think I've ever given out my address to the internet dating girls I've meet, I'm normally far too cautious for that. Fast forward, 30 minutes into the movie, and a little bit of cuddling, I asked her if she wanted to get into my hot tub. I figured why not ask and see how she responds. With some hesitation she said yes and so we did, unclothed except for bottoms. While we were in the hot tub I reflected back on what had just taken place. It's pretty crazy to think I had never spoken to this girl 22 hours prior, and now this 24 year old college girl with a runners body is topless and making out with me in my hot tub.<p>I've been hanging out with this girl just about every other night since we met a week and a half ago.

Yet, we as flawed humans still seek objective punishment for others's offenses, even when we don't personally ascribe to claiming those offenses for ourselves. This to me is the most interesting part of all of this, that everybody has a ready-made opinion about what thing should happen to these people involved even though the original offense was 100% subjective. This brings up some interesting questions:<p>1) Can one really be offended by hearing a story about a subjective offense from someone else, and thus pass legitimate judgment? If so, what is the real offense - the original act, or merely what the act represents.\n2) If the true offense is about what the act represents, then does passing judgment on the offensive party appropriately handle the situation?\n3) If an offense is a subjective thing, then does it need to be personal, and directed toward the offendee in order to be legitimate?",1363888121

I can't remember any specifics of what turned me away from it, though the thing that SlickEdit does better than almost everyone else is tagging. I use boost::shared_ptr (and now the C++11 version) a LOT, and so completion is useless in anything that doesn't know how to complete a template class. ctags and its ilk, last time I checked, were worthless in this regard, and I have a vague sense that Zeus relied on those for tagging? Yes, looking at the web site, you're using ctags. Will ""shared_ptr<Foo> foo; foo->"" autocomplete for members of Foo?<p>SlickEdit also Just Works with tagging. You put the files into a project, and everything is instantly cross-referenced. ""Where is Foo::init() used? No, I don't want Blah::init(), just Foo::init()."" SlickEdit, at least SOME of the time, can get that right, and with no configuration of external tools.<p>Aside from that, I think one of the greatest drawbacks of Slickedit is that it isn't open source, so when things go wrong I can't just fix it. Slickedit IS cross-platform, at least, with native Linux and Mac OS versions, and that ALSO is important to me.<p>Lua is the Right Answer for scripting, IMO. The rest of the options are actually a liability for me, since it means that if I'm editing someone else's script, I might have to deal with Python, TCL, or JavaScript.<p>I'm rambling now. I feel like I have an ""Editor Manifesto"" in my head that wants to get out, but I don't have time right now to do it justice.

Email and Fidonet EchoGroups came in daily, or maybe twice a day, when you dialed into your upstream provider.

There are ""application"" oriented apps, primarily single page, large, and not content driven (gmail, docs, games, etc), and then there are page-oriented apps, like forums, content management systems, blogs, database backed forms/reports, etc.<p>The former lend them selves really well to the structured approach. You trade off simplicity and iteration speed for more of a ""on rails"" experience, but it helps for larger teams to collaborate on larger projects to have some restrictions on freedom and some mutually agreed upon consistent behaviors.<p>However, the latter page-oriented apps fit in a lot better with these microframeworks. And page oriented apps fit in with the original vision of the Web, they are documents, they have URL addressable, RESTful, hopefully, durable content, indexable by search engines, and linkable by anyone.<p>I think there is room for both and a sweet spot for different approaches. I often use several languages for specially suited purposes, like sed/awk/Perl for text processing, JS for small page oriented stuff or mocks, GWT for larger apps. I would not advocate GWT for people for building progressively enhanced page-oriented apps, even though I'm the author of GwtQuery and AngularGWT.<p>Using the right tool for the job often depends on context and personal preference. A lone hacker or small team can get by with doing a large app in hand coded JS with hand rolled build tools and module systems, but frustrate other people coming onto the project.<p>There is too much, IMHO, ""one above all"" thinking when it comes to development, and often, the original goals -- what the app is supposed to do for the end user, get lost in the zeal to build a cool framework or infrastructure for it.",1363887332

It has very little to do with what the truth is, rather an opinion of the masses that has been manipulated that way.",1363887029

A lot of guys (me included) will say really rank things to their close friends - explicitly letting their friends know when they're getting fat, jokes about sleeping with their friends' wives and mothers, and so forth.

If there are no clear advantages on the business side that justifies the investment, then there is no pressure to the front-end devs to do it.<p>Good engineering also means optimizing technical designs for the usage of the technology in order to reduce costs.

Like thousands of people Im dreaming every day about many things. And every day I asked myself - how people could realize their dreams when its too expensive?<p>So I thought it would be awesome if everyone can share their dreams to each other and vote for best ones. Then i thought what if the most liked dreams will come true? That how Dreamise was born.<p>Idea is very simple - people post their wishes, do some actions and get what they want.  Every dream has a rating, which you can control. All your actions influence on your rating. More you active, more rating you receive. Every month we realize top rated dreams.<p>As Dreamise execute dreams - it needs money. But we think that advertising sucks so we decided to make free and premium accounts. Premium costs as low as $5 per month. Only premium accounts can participate in dreams rating. I think thats honestly coz if you want something to get you must also something to give.<p>But even if you have free account your dream may also be realized by other person. I mean if someone knew that he can easily realize your dream... why not?<p>After all I want to say that this Spring well start Dreamise BETA. It would be completely FREE for all and well realize 3 top dreams. Also first 1000 people that signed up for beta will get 3 months premium accounts for FREE!

5416829,comment,5415256,5415256,3,0,jackowayed,,,"There are some things people in these threads are chronically getting wrong.<p>First, lots of people are making the claim that this was a ""private"" joke. It was not. If it was a private joke and they shouldn't be punished for that reason, then they should have been able to say <i>anything</i>, and as long as everyone who was meant to be in the private conversation appreciated it, it would be wrong to punish them because it was private.<p>So here's an example: What if they made a joke wherein they said, ""Let's lynch a <n word>""? They likely would have been kicked out, could easily have been fired, and no one would have much sympathy for them. Why? Because <i>it's not in private</i>. They were at a conference, which is a community gathering with community standards to make sure that everyone feels welcome, and they were talking when literally surrounded by attendees they don't know. What they say absolutely has an effect on how welcome others feel. We've decided that it's important enough that all feel welcome that we've made codes of conduct.<p>So once we've established that there are things they could have said that would make their behavior unacceptable, you're now saying ""that comment didn't warrant this response"", not ""this was a private conversation! how could they ever kick them out or fire them for that?""<p>And at that point, we get to all the arguments that this joke ""wasn't sexist"". It is true, that the joke itself was not sexist; it did not objectify women, suggest that they are less than men, etc.<p>But it was contributing to aspects of the tech industry's culture that make it less welcoming to women, and for that reason, it is unacceptable at a professional conference. (It's also just crude and might make some men uncomfortable, and so is unacceptable for that reason too.) In nearly every context that a woman in tech finds herself, she is surrounded by men. This can often make them feel somewhat unwelcome or uncomfortable. Even little things, like a few people who make comments suggesting that they're nontechnical, or a few people asking them out at every single meetup they go to, can make them feel less comfortable and less valued for what they came to the conference to do--be technical.<p>Anything that contributes to the feeling of the conference being a boy's club, or sexualizes the environment, can make this worse.<p>Finally, many people ask, ""Why didn't she just say something to them?"" While I don't think going straight to twitter was the best she could have done, I also don't think people understand how difficult it can be to approach someone and call them out on behavior that makes one feel uncomfortable, especially in a space where one already does not feel especially welcome or taken seriously. If everyone yells, ""you should have just talked to them!"" every time a woman immediately complains to organizers about inappropriate behavior, you're just encouraging more women to silently feel unwelcome, and likely drop out of the community, rather than speaking up and helping make the community better. I agree that, when comfortable, directly speaking with the offending party is best way to deal with these problems, but those who have been made uncomfortable have absolutely no responsibility to do so, and shouldn't be pushed to do it even if they are not comfortable with it.",1363885652

Or if you're desperately trying to pull one page up quickly while on your smart phone in a region with sketchy (at best) mobile reception.<p>I'm one of those people who are obsessed with keeping file sizes to a minimum and, quite frankly, I find it ""hilarious"" when developers create sites with both a heavy bandwidth footprint and heavy CPU footprint rendering the bloody thing just because they insist users should experience a full desktop experience inside a web page. Those are different paradigms with different limitations and bottlenecks. Trying to shoehorn in a desktop paradigm (regardless of how elegant the OP might have considered Cappuccino's code) for the web simply didn't make sense back then; and that is why his project failed.<p>I also want to stress that I'm not against interactive sites. Obviously there is a happy medium between minimal design and the OP's vision of the web. However there have been studies that have proven that even a fraction of a second longer page load time can drive business away from your site. And given this and my former points, it makes considerable more sense to use more compact libraries to begin with.<p>Lastly, his point about many developers being unwilling to spend a little time learning web frameworks is something that I haven't personally encountered. But I can agree with his frustration on that specific remark if it is true.",1363885582

I had only been programming in school so far (which was fairly different from programming in the real world) and this site was really my first real-world application. Back then I was using MySQL (!) as my main data store. I was storing Likes/Dislikes as polymorphic Rails models, but then I read about Redis and it sounded like the perfect fit for all the set math I would have to do. So when refreshing recommendations, I would pull the ratings out of MySQL and feed them into Redis to do some fast set math. Then I'd tear down the Redis sets. I only had friends on the site testing it out for me, so I didn't notice much of a problem.<p>Later, I switched my database to PostgreSQL but wasn't having Redis issues at that point, so I let it be. Then when goodbre.ws found itself with a lot of new faces, I found myself with the I/O bottleneck I mentioned in the article. I decided to try to solve that by moving the ratings to permanently reside in Redis. That way I'd only have to hit Redis a couple times to regenerate someone's recommendations. Then I started storing too much in my ZSETS, but here I am now.<p>Now that I've reduced that memory footprint again, I feel as though attempting to move the ratings back into Postgres would be a premature optimization in itself. I was, however, looking into some combination of Postgres' array types (to replace the sets) and hstore (to replace the ZSETS, but sort in the query).

Constantly updating (in big monolithic chunks). Consuming hundreds of MBs of memory.<p>I'm not trying to criticize specifically Rdio, but I guarantee that initiative started with someone slamming the web and its crazy mishmash of standards, promising that they'd do something that would exploit the full power of the client.

Amazon has fielded various trials with various rich apps (they usually partner with Microsoft), but you've never seen them because they never have a compelling story, coming with enough detriments that it outweighs the benefits.

But if someone does something in response to how they feel they were offended, we're going to judge that response by how reasonable that offense seems to us.<p>If the two men in the situation we're talking about had been making crude remarks directly to her and she had contacted the organizers I don't think any body (I care about) would have questioned her actions.  If she had pulled a gun and shot them, then I think everybody would agree that that was unjustified.  And if she had complained to the organizers because the men were wearing VI polo shirts and she was a diehard emacs user that would also be unjustified.<p>And there are some forms of receiving offense, such as when a racist seeing a black person at a Python convention, where them taking any action at all based on that offence would be wrong.  I'm sure there was at least one person like that at PyCon, but I'm also sure that society has trained them to keep their mouth shut.  And a good thing too.<p>So we don't get to tell Adria what is offensive to her, but when she shames someone based on that offence we will judge her shaming based on how valid we judge to offence to be.  If one of the men had told her to her face that women didn't belong at PyCon then I think her actions would have been entirely justified.  As it was, not so much.",1363885340

Witness the recent UEFI controversy.  Had Microsoft (or Google) been in charge of Linux, you'd have to obtain a corporate license just to boot a freeware OS.  The entity that controls the foundation technology is vitally important.<p>So-called enhancements like UEFI or Dart are always introduced with benign intentions.  ""to make the web more secure""  ""to improve performance"" ""to protect the children""  The end result is more corporate control, more centralization, fewer options for individuals and small organizations.<p>A bunch of people who have downvoted my anti-Dart posts are Dart engineers.  I think Dart engineers are really smart, and have produced a great technology.  I don't think Dart engineers are scheming to bring down Javascript.<p>But I don't think Reader engineers built their product with a plan to wipe out alternative readers and damage RSS.  I don't think Calendar engineers planned to vacuum up the competition then remove the CalDAV option to migrate their data.  But that's what happened.  It would be a shame if Javascript were similarly compromised.",1363885313

The thought of copying someone's idea never even vaguely occurred to me - indeed, I was taken on board to further develop a preexisting idea. May not be true at less reputable venture firms, but in general the maxim of not worrying too much about people stealing your idea  still applies.<p>That said, it's the first time I hear of HIRs, and I don't think retaining such people at VCs makes any sense, precisely because this concern seems more real. It's cool if the VCs themselves have hacker backgrounds of course, but having a full time hacker on board is another matter.",1363885294

For instance, using it required an expensive development kit, namely a Mac. Back in 1987 even a lowly Mac Plus would cost you $2,500, which in today's dollars is more than $5,000. Contrast that to the Web, which you can author for on the oldest, crustiest commodity hardware you please and where even back in the mid-'90s you could get started with just a text editor and a few bucks a month for hosting.<p>""HyperCard was far more accessible to non-computer scientists than the web is or has been.""<p>A simple comparison of the total number of HyperCard stacks built versus the total number of Web sites built would argue otherwise. You can argue about whether HyperCard authoring is more intuitive than HTML authoring (I think it was), but as soon as the Web came along people decided for themselves which of the two they preferred to hack on.",1363885242

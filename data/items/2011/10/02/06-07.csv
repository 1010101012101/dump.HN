Transitioning to alternative energy sources is incredibly expensive - it will be a major drain on the economy to do so because alt fuels are still struggling to hit grid parity and we still don't have a serious way to reduce oil consumption for gasoline.<p>So the choice is really between\n1) Oil and gas extraction using new technologies with all the attendant risks (and there many)\n2) Forget the new technologies and continue to rely more and more on unstable oppressive regimes (Middle East, Russia, etc)\n3) Take a major hit to economic growth and aggressively push alternative fuels.<p>I would recommend (1).  Option (2) leads to greater geopolitical instability and very significant long-term risks.  Option (3) will undermine economic growth at a time when there is consensus that growth is a priority.<p>Obviously, this is grossly simplified, but my general point is that we have a limited option set and in truth, none are very attractive.

It's needless context switching when I have a general idea of how I want the code structured before I start writing anyway.<p>With more experience, you should learn to avoid many of the pitfalls of not writing/designing modularly enough in the first place and at that point writing your tests first becomes a productivity crutch.",1317538024

Cities don't have any claim on that money.  If the cities <i>really</i> think they're getting a raw deal tax-wise, then they can institute a municipal income tax the way NYC does.  I suspect New York is the only city that can actually get away with it over the long run, though.<p>>Meanwhile, they commute into a city on a freeway paid for by the urbanites and enjoy all the benefits of city infrastructure, without paying for it.<p>They pay for the freeways with gas and income taxes.  At least in my state cities don't maintain freeways, that's done at the state level.  Their employers pay taxes to the city, they pay taxes on everything they buy on their lunch break.  On Friday night they come into the city and drop more money in bars and restaurants, and part of that money makes its way into city coffers.  Shouldn't the cities be returning some of that money to the suburbs?<p>In any event, it's not the suburbs that come out ahead tax-wise.  It's the rural areas.  Rural America is heavily subsidized at both the state and national level and most of those studies don't make any distinction.<p>One other point... the highway system, which city people always count as a ""subsidy"" of other areas is most heavily used to move goods from one population center to another.

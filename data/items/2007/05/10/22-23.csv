But programming today is so much better than programming back then.  And everything that was good about the Amiga community is great about the Linux, Ruby, Python, Perl, etc. communities today.<p>Amiga E and C with DICE were both hard slogs for me (my high school had BASIC classes and an AP Pascal class, still taught on Apple IIe computers--but I took them for the easy A rather than actually learning anything...from day one I knew more about software development than the instructor).  ARexx was easier to grasp for someone who cut his teeth on writing games for the Color 64 BBS system (in BASIC).  I also did a little 6510 assembly, but that was really unpleasant after the initial coolness factor wore off (and I embody one of Larry Wall's three virtues: Laziness, so the coolness wore off just about immediately).  But, compared to Perl, Python, Ruby, Lisp, Scheme, etc. plus the resources available to everyone on the Internet, I'm kinda sad to think back on how much time I wasted slogging through poorly written books about poorly written compilers.  If only I'd known to seek out K&R early on.  (I knew enough to want the Amiga 3000UX when it came out, but I wasn't quite sure why!).  What was a nerdy kid in the suburbs in the poor southeast to do?",1178837943

21180,comment,21107,21107,0,0,nicomarchesotti,,,"Is my first post. Yes at the moment I am working on 2 different business plans. \nOne has to do with recycling ink cartridges. I have found by the research I have done that there is quite an interesting and virgin market for that here in Spain.\nThe second is a company which has been working for 2 years but I am remodeling the system of production. This one is about Selling school planners.<p>",1178836751
21179,comment,21111,21111,0,0,BrandonM,,,"Hmm... that assumes the Java/C++/Python technique of methods belonging to objects.  The CLOS (from Lisp) technique is to define the methods independent of the objects.  That is, in C++ you might say<p>class Bicycle {<p>  // data fields<p>  void fix (void) {\n   ...\n  }<p>}<p>b = Bicycle();\nb.fix();<p>In Lisp, you would say:<p>(defclass Bicycle ...)<p>(defmethod fix ((bike Bicycle)) (...))<p>(fix b)<p>So now, for the sheep/shepherd example, you no longer need to decide which class the method belongs to.  You simply define a shepherd and sheep class and then...<p>(defmethod sheer ((sheep Sheep) (shep Shepherd))...)<p>I guess what I'm trying to say is that OO doesn't necessarily suck for the given reasons.  The examples that the author gives are a good case why the C++ version of OO sucks, but OO in general is much more interesting.<p>That's not to say that everything has a good OO solution.  I am definitely in agreement with pg that OO is hardly necessary for the vast majority of problems, and that it typically leads to spaghetti code.<p>I recently wrote a small Lisp interpreter in C for a Programming Languages class.  I found it quite interesting that after defining S-expressions and a few operations on them (cons, car, cdr, ...), I didn't really need any other data structures.  One simple, powerful data structure makes all that other object cruft unnecessary.",1178836601
21178,comment,21019,21019,0,0,sbraford,,,"I would upmod this but I'd be afraid even more non-hacker friends would bug me.<p>To be honest -- I'd be scared of any incredibly bright individual (even who went to b-school or majored in art history) who was not willing to get their hands dirty with at least a little code.<p>If you're building the next Google, okay, they probably can't help much.<p>But if you're building your average CRUDish webapp, you don't need that many CS rocket scientists to get er done.",1178836247

The special feature was that people could ""adopt"" the result page for themselves and add more specific information. So it was also a kind of Wiki, I guess.<p>The other one also allowed people to add meta data to the search result, in theory a kind of semantic web could emerge.<p>Both are fairly recent startups, I think. Don't know why I can't find them in my bookmarks anymore :-(",1178834647

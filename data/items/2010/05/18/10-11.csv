Your conclusion is that she is a pathological narcissist, but it is <i>you</i> that makes the story completely about her. On the other hand, <i>she</i> clearly recognized that this man's life <i>wasn't</i> solely about her and she correctly concluded that any problems probably weren't solely about her either.<p>She lets the guy get a broader perspective, by <i>reducing</i> her own importance in his life, by letting him discover a taste of a life without her, and yet you, and others, manage to interpret that as a sign of narcissism. I don't understand that one bit. It could as well have played out in a completely different way, where the guy liked his newfound freedom enough to go through with the separation. The fact that he stayed is a pretty strong signal that she was right and that it wasn't about her, as she guessed. A narcissist couldn't possibly guess that something wasn't about her.<p>Your story boils down to 'guy finally has the guts to tell her how it stands, because he is sick of her emotional blackmail, but he's actually a pussy, because a new bit of emotional manipulation is enough to make him reconsider'. That really doesn't sound very convincing.",1274179914

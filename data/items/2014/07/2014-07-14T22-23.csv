You produce 1 million socks a month and another company only 10 thousand. You obviously can&#x27;t just drop prices on 10 thousands socks of yours, because that would still allow your competitor to stay in business - since there is demand for the rest of 990k of socks at your high price, your competitor would simply grab another 10k of your socks market share and then you&#x27;ll only be able to sell 980k at your high price and not 990k. You actually have to drop prices on all 1 million socks of yours, which is going to be pretty damn detrimental to your profits.<p><i>> The competitiveness of a market depends on the costs of entering it.</i><p>What&#x27;s there to prevent a rich investor from entering the market and competing? Google had no problem competing with Apple on the smartphone market, it seems. The goal is not to allow anyone with no money to compete. The goal is to allow to compete companies who have sufficient resources to do so. That&#x27;s what the competition is about.",1405378777

8033726,comment,8033051,8033051,14,0,x0x0,,,"This is bloody depressing to read, and rings true in my experience.<p>One of my pet peeves is relocation costs.  Companies in nyc try to hire me at least every six months, particularly since I used to live there.  You can tell who is an asshole by asking about relo packages.  If they start at $5k my wanker detector goes off.  Assholes offer maybe up to $10k, often as a hiring bonus, so it&#x27;s taxed; maybe $6k might land in my checking account.  That&#x27;s a joke for a mid-30s data scientist.  A trip to nyc for me plus partner to shop for apartments alone is $2.5k (2 airline tickets, taxis, meals, boarding a dog, 3 nights in manhattan hotels).  Then the costs of apartment rental, job search for partner, winding down an apartment lease here, selling a car, and moving a grown up apartment -- ie I own a real bed and dressers and a couch and a table -- across the country.  A relocation would cost me on the order of $15-$20k after taxes.<p>Yet ceos whine endlessly about the lack of good employees.

8033720,comment,8027326,8028846,1,0,SoftwareMaven,,,"I&#x27;m still not understanding why it should be illegal. We can start with an assumption that Vendor X eliminated their competition by fair practices or they would already be subject to antitrust regulations. If Vendor X uses their position to unfairly prevent competition (either in their own space or others), they are already breaking the law. If they aren&#x27;t doing that, I fail to see why just having lock-in should be illegal.<p>This is not to say I&#x27;m a fan of vendor lock-in. Quite the opposite, actually. But I do know laws like this will <i>always</i> have unintended consequences, will <i>always</i> be manipulated by those same large companies ostensibly being regulated to give them advantages over new entrants, and, as a result, will <i>always</i> make the competitive landscape more difficult than it would have otherwise been. How big does your market have to be? How big does your company have to be? Is the broadband chip on your phone subject or just your whole phone?

I kept creeping away from Marketing and towards Code and after 6 months I was 100% a &quot;programming intern&quot;. At that point I was still a beginner but I definitely provided value to the team. After another 4 months my boss once said &quot;If you want to work here full time, you can&quot;. 2 weeks later I was bored and annoyed in class so I dropped out and took him up on the offer.<p>After that, it&#x27;s smooth sailing. Once you have just one job as a &quot;software engineer&quot; people don&#x27;t pay much attention to the education part of your resume. At this point, your perceived quality is based pretty much entirely on past projects - this means both open source projects and your past employment history.<p>During interviews, employers will be hesitant to believe that you have strong fundamentals (which is usually true), and they may push a little more than a CS student. Even though employers readily admit that &#x27;implement a sort function&#x27; isn&#x27;t real life, they will ask you to do it because they just want to know that you have a grip on things like O Notation (this comes up pretty much every time) just so that you know how to actually &#x27;think&#x27; about a program and give a thought to performance, as most self-taught programmers don&#x27;t. I&#x27;ve only been rejected by one company that interviewed me, and during those coding interviews I admitted to having no idea what I was doing while writing a sort function (even though I did write a bubble sort) and had pretty much no knowledge of O Notation. They said they were &#x27;looking for someone more senior&#x27; and they were right at the time. So basically, just know that even if you are a very pragmatic programmer who can build anything, you will still be tested on fundamentals and it is important.<p>I should mention that I got my first internship through HN&#x27;s &quot;Who&#x27;s Hiring&quot; thread. Those are the type of companies you should shoot for.",1405377810

8033645,comment,8031840,8032314,2,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"> Why do local ISP markets tend towards monopoly, even though it has been illegal since 1992 to grant local cable monopolies? Two words: universal access.<p>It&#x27;s true that universal access is what causes networks in major cities to lack competition. But getting rid of it wouldn&#x27;t solve the problem anywhere else, because there are still millions of people who live in areas that couldn&#x27;t economically justify more than one ISP. The only way those areas can justify the investment is if the ISP can collect revenue from a majority of the customers (and/or not compete aggressively on price), meaning that a competitor entering the market would cause both ISPs to become unprofitable and so no rational investor will be the second to service that market. Those geographical areas are natural monopolies. There is very little realistic alternative to utility regulations in those markets, short of massive government subsidies to create market conditions that can sustain multiple competitors.<p>> There is no free lunch. You can have: neutrality, universal access, or a mostly privately-funded telecom infrastructure, but you only get to pick two. If you think universal access is important, and net neutrality is important, you have to be willing to publicly subsidize the construction of telecom infrastructure.<p>That isn&#x27;t necessarily true. What it means is that without public investment, the subscription fees for internet service have to be sufficient to justify private investment. It isn&#x27;t at all clear that they aren&#x27;t already at that level. The lack of investment in many markets is at least in significant part attributable to the fact that neither competition nor regulation currently provides a large incentive to make infrastructure improvements. But there is no reason that in markets with insufficient competition, regulations could not be made to create that incentive, e.g. allowing ISPs to charge higher rates only if they provide higher speeds and then over time increasing the required speed for a given rate. And ironically the rates required to justify a given level of investment would be <i>lower</i> if we had <i>less</i> competition, because the cost to wire a street is in large part proportional to the number of miles of road rather than the number of subscribers, so Verizon and Comcast having to build parallel networks each with half the total number of subscribers causes each to be significantly less profitable and that much less likely to make future investments. &quot;More competition&quot; is not a panacea.<p>And more than that, why is public investment in infrastructure a controversial position? We have public roads, what&#x27;s wrong with public last mile networks?",1405377156

There&#x27;s quite a bit of construction going on, and wonderfully it isn&#x27;t all dedicated to resorts and condos. Tourism will probably always be part of the local equation but some businesses are starting to use those tourist dollars to build more sustainable businesses (e.g. Maui Brewing Company, Ocean Vodka, Maui Built, etc.). What I hope to have happen is to have that growth channeled into making Maui more friendly to developers such as yourself. Things such as more banking geared to handle businesses, more/better funding of schools, some &quot;affordable&quot; housing that isn&#x27;t surrounded by timeshares, co-working spaces, more knowledge sharing opportunities (conferences, informal networks, etc), and of course attracting talented people who can leverage all of this to build some great stuff.",1405376551

So, in a sense, I hired myself at Fogbeam.<p>As for how you might go about getting that first job... I think  one of the keys is &quot;build stuff&quot;.  I mean, it&#x27;s cliche to talk about &quot;Github is your new resume&quot; but there is a lot of truth to the idea that &quot;code talks, bullshit walks&quot;.  Pick a project of some sort that interests you, and start building it.  So much the better if it&#x27;s something you don&#x27;t feel totally qualified to build yet.<p>When you go in to talk to a prospective employer, if they&#x27;re smart, they&#x27;ll dig into your project and use that to help get a good feel for what you are capable of.  It&#x27;s OK if it&#x27;s not perfect, as a smart employer will understand that you&#x27;re green, and if you show the ability to actually ship something, you will be in good shape.<p>Beyond that, I&#x27;d say one top hint is this: Be ready to defend the decisions you made building your app, with reasons beyond &quot;Because I heard X was cool on Hacker News&quot;.  If somebody asks &quot;why are you using Angular on the front-end and a REST backend built using Sling&quot; then have some meat to talk about.  If somebody asks &quot;how could module FOO be implemented in a functional language?&quot; (assuming it&#x27;s not currently) be ready to talk about that.  Better yet, be proactive... a conversation like this is very valuable:<p>Interviewer:  Why did you <i>X</i>?<p>You:  Well, I thought about <i>X</i>, <i>Y</i> and <i>Z</i>, and each has it&#x27;s pros and cons.  I would have gone with <i>Z</i> if this app were meant to scale to millions of users, but since it was mainly a learning project, I went with <i>Y</i> because $WHATEVER.  I kinda ruled out <i>X</i> early on because $SOMETHING.<p>Letting passion show is good too.  If somebody asks &quot;Why did you build a machine learning library?&quot;  it&#x27;s good if you make it clear that you did it because you are genuinely enthusiastic about machine learning and wanted to get some hands-on experience implementing the algorithms, etc., etc.  It&#x27;s not so good if your answer is &quot;Well, it seemed like the kind of thing you could make a lot of money from&quot;.  Not that wanting to make money is bad, mind you.  But a genuine passion for a topic / interest area is much more interesting that strictly financial interest, IMO.<p>Anyway, build stuff, explore your interests, read and learn as much as you can, build more stuff, and you&#x27;ll find something.",1405376513

Most legislators can be persuaded with campaign contributions (the carrot) but those that can&#x27;t get threatened with the stick, which comes in the form of a previously unheard of but suddenly flush primary opponent.<p>Add gerrymandering to the mix, and this tactic becomes even harder to resist, since the effective sidelining of an opposing party means that no matter what else happens, the seat in question stays with the side that already holds it. This is what people mean by &quot;safe&quot; seats, by the way. They&#x27;re safe for the <i>party</i>. Particular incumbents, not so much.<p>So yes. If you have a realistic hope of getting what you want it&#x27;s because you&#x27;re known to have the power to end careers. If legislators refuse to cooperate, their prospects dim. If an agency gets uncooperative, the legislators who oversee it turn the budget screws, causing pain and wrecking livelihoods until the backer with the biggest stick wins. These are the mechanics of regulatory capture, and they&#x27;re in operation every day.<p>Obviously, all of this deeply depressing, and provides an excellent argument for getting private finance out of elections altogether, since that really is the mechanism upon which American-style corruption depends. And while we&#x27;re at it, de-rigging the vote with non-partisan redistricting and establishing a nation-wide version of the (pre-gutted) Voting Rights Act would go a long way in fostering a government of, by, and for the people.<p>But in the meantime, when our systems is less like a democracy and more like an oligarchy, getting what you want means playing by the rules that exist. And that means lobbying with both carrot and stick. They hit you, you hit back. And not only do you hit back harder, you hit back so hard that they will never get up again. That&#x27;s what the SOPA/PIPA backlash did: threatened a sweeping act of maximum violence to an unprecedented number of careers.<p>It was brutal and it was ugly, but it worked.

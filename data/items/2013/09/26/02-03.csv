The religion that happens to dominate countries full of desperate people is... Islam.<p>I think Christians have a bigger body count than Muslims over the course of human history, primarily because the Europeans happen to be Christian.  Hard to think of any religion that hasn&#x27;t been used to justify a bunch of violence and murder.  The violence by people quoting Islam today is mice nuts compared to (a) the crusades, (b) the protestant reformation, (c) the colonization of the new world.<p>You should really read Guns, Germs, and Steel before claiming that there is something special about this particular religion.  Get a little sense of history.  Islam in the 600s was amazingly progressive.

However, I also realise there is a market for a better alternative to Wordpress for blogging. Medium I think has shown there is a demand for a nicely designed blog application with focus on content.<p>Have you ever tried scaling Wordpress to thousands of visitors per day before? It takes a whole lot more than installing a caching plugin... Using Wordpress as a blog from a cost perspective is expensive, especially once you install a few plugins to make the overall experience better. A Node.JS powered version of Wordpress would be something I would jump on if it were to ever come to fruition.<p>Wordpress for use just as a blog nowadays is crazy. You don&#x27;t install Wordpress if you want a simple blog, you install it if you want a website. It&#x27;s a CMS, not a blogging platform any more. People are yearning for alternatives, Ghost might not reach the scale of Wordpress and usage stats over night, but I think it will make a splash.

I love it!<p>I believe I have an unpopular opinion about desktop PCs.  The conventional thinking is that desktop computing is boring because a modern PC does everything it is intended to do just fine.  That may be true, but the problem is that the industry is not interested in establishing <i>new usage patterns</i>new things the PC <i>should do</i>.<p>At the end of last year, I started a series of rants about how modern technology sucks [1] with particular emphasis on the frustrating stagnation of desktop computing and the bothersome way every new portable computing device wants to be a center of attention.<p>I was pleasantly surprised that the author of the linked article hits the target squarely when he lists off what PCs need.  The first item: better displays.  He may be speaking more about laptops (and they are deserving of the shame), but allow me to rant a bit about my preferred computing mediumdesktops.<p>The stagnation of desktop displays is, and has been for a decade, the crucial failure of desktop computing.  Display stagnation is the limitation that allows all other limitations to be tolerated.  It is the barrier that leads the overwhelming majority of users (and even pundits!) who tolerate mediocrity to declare everything elsefrom processors, to memory and GPUsas &quot;good enough.&quot;  I absolutely seethe when I hear any technology declared good enough (at least without a very compelling argument).<p>Desktop displays, and by extension, desktop computing is so far from good enough that it <i>should</i> be self-evident to anyone who observes users interacting with tablets or mobile phones(!) while seated at a desktop PC.  Everything that is wrong with modern computing can be summarized in that single all too common scene:<p>1. Desktop displays are not pleasant to look at.  They are too small.  They are too dark.  They are too low-fidelity.  And they often have annoying bezels down the middle of your view because we routinely compensate for their mediocrity by using more of them, side-by-side.<p>2. The performance of desktop computers is neglected because &quot;how hard is it to run a browser and Microsoft Office?&quot;  This leads to lethargy in updating desktop PCs, both by IT and by users (&quot;I don&#x27;t want the hassle&quot;).  In 2013, I suspect many corporate PCs in fact <i>feel</i> slower than a modern tablet or even mobile phone.<p>3. Desktop operating systems are actively attempting to move away from (or at least marginalize) their strong suits of personal applications and input devices tailored for precision and all-day usage.<p>4. Desktop computers--and more accurately personal home networks--have lost their role as the central computing hub for individuals by a misguided means of gaining application omnipresence: what I call &quot;the plain cloud.&quot;  This is because none in the desktop industry (Microsoft most notably) are working to make personal networks appreciably manageable by laypeople.<p>5. Mobile phones and tablets are often free of IT shackles and therefore enjoy more R&D (more money to be made).<p>Desktop displays stopped moving forward in capability in 2001, and in large part regressed (as the article points out) since then.  Had they continued to move forward--had the living room&#x27;s poisonous moniker of &quot;HD&quot; spared computer monitors its wrath--I believe we would have breathtaking desktop displays by now.  In that alternate universe, my desktop is equipped with a 50+&quot; display with at least 12,000 horizontal pixels.<p>Desktop computing needs to leverage immersion (without nausea; VR goggles need not apply, yet).  Large form-factor super-high-definition displays would bring all manner of new technology needs with them:<p>1. Gesture controls.<p>2. Ultra high-bandwidth wired networking (win for wired network folks) to move super high definition files.<p>3. Ultra high-capacity storage.<p>4. Extremely fast processors and GPUs to deal with a much greater visual pipeline.<p>Such a computing environment is a trojan horse for today&#x27;s tablets: it turns tablets into subservient devices as seen in science fiction films such as Avatar.  The tablet is just a <i>view</i> on your application, allowing you to take your work away from the main work space briefly until you return.  I say trojan horse, but that&#x27;s not quite right because I actually <i>want</i> this subservient kind of tablet very much.  I <i>do not</i> want a tablet that is a first-class computing device in its own right (even less do I want a phone to be a first-class computing device).  I only want one first-class computing device in my life, running singular instances of applications for me and me only, and I want all my devices to be subservient to that singular application host.<p>For the time being, that should be the desktop PC.  In the long haul, it could be any application host (a local compute server, a compute server I lease from someone else, or maybe even a portable device as envisioned by Ubuntu&#x27;s phone).  But for now, the desktop should re-assert its rightful role as a chief computing environment, making all other devices mobile views.<p>[1] <a href=""http://tiamat.tsotech.com/technology-sucks"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tiamat.tsotech.com/technology-sucks</a>",1380163000

Intel isn&#x27;t willing to go after software. Are they smart to limit themselves? Microsoft is at least pretending to make hardware  alienating all the OEMs in the process and Intel doesn&#x27;t have what it takes to make software?<p>2. Cheap laptops have traditionally been Intel&#x27;s enterprise play. Dell/HP/Lenovo are still selling 1366x768. Is Intel serious about their integrated graphics, while their customers are still being outfitted with 1366x768?<p>3. The server market is not a safe place to hide. Talk of how Intel is safe on servers ignores the consumer market and Intel is obviously not going to ignore the consumer.<p>So are we down to a single supplier for all our computers (Apple)?

Pretty much everybody has a PC at home and work. Most households already have multiple computers. Heck, I know entirely non-technical powerwasher/gutter cleaner guys who have 2 or 3 computers. In fact, I don&#x27;t know a single person older than 10 years old who doesn&#x27;t have at least one Personal Computer of some kind.<p>Any commodity off-the-shelf PC will pretty much do whatever you ask of it (at least for most consumers). I used to replace my computer every year or two just so I could run modern software. I haven&#x27;t felt compelled to do so for the last 6 years and even then I&#x27;m 50/50 on doing it. The rMBP my work issued to me is fantastic for virtualization, but unbelievable overkill for everything else I do (mostly email, word and web).<p>There&#x27;s just not much of a reason to buy more machines outside of regular replacement rates due to failure and total obsolescence and new humans buying them as they get old enough.<p>It&#x27;s not that PCs aren&#x27;t coming back, it&#x27;s that the constant growth in the market has plateaued.<p>Everybody was hoping China, India and Africa would explode 3/5s of the world&#x27;s humanity moved into the middle-class and needed computers, but the growth has been far slower than was hoped and these first time computer buyers won&#x27;t really be constantly upgrading like previous markets did -- the market characteristics are such that it won&#x27;t be a simple repeat of the 80s, 90s and early 2000s.<p>Smartphones and Tablets are an entirely new segment and still growing (though showing some signs of flattening out as well). That&#x27;s why they&#x27;re exciting, because <i>those</i> markets are still building out and upgrading. But there are signs that those segments are flattening as well.<p>Tablets and phones are awesome, but they&#x27;re definitely not a replacement for a general purpose PC. Even my mother and father, who&#x27;re quite the luddites, regularly needs capabilities that don&#x27;t work well on a tablet -- like doing taxes. Even if those things were magically fixed and working awesomely tomorrow, they&#x27;d still want a bigger screen than a tablet afford.<p>PCs aren&#x27;t going anywhere, it&#x27;s just that the market has to shift to sustaining the market not growing it (which is infinitely more expensive, meaning loads more money sloshing around in the secondary markets). This is fundamentally the problem that both Intel <i>and</i> Microsoft are dealing with. Apple escaped it largely because they <i>created</i> new segments to grow into.<p>Heck, the one new market segment that PC makers <i>did</i> manage to get into, netbooks, they managed to screw up so bad that the entire segment was dead within just a few years. (If you think of where netbooks needed to go as a segment, the Surface Pro would probably be a reasonable outcome, except that market is totally hosed now and Microsoft has to rebuild it).",1380161452

I don&#x27;t feel the Apple experience is a lot better than the PC one, and  I say that as someone who fully bought into the dream (I used a MBP as my main machine for 2 years, and an iMac as a desktop for that same two years). After those two years where up, I totally went back to PC, built my own desktop, bought a nice Lenovo laptop and called it a day.<p>However, I guess I really don&#x27;t understand why everyone&#x27;s getting so uptight about. What we&#x27;re seeing is not everyone in the world suddenly making a change to mobile for no discernible reason. It&#x27;s not as though suddenly the winds changed and now PC is mysteriously dying.<p>No, what happened is what always happens: someone made a better tool for the mass market to do what they want to do, which is to consume content and be entertained. Magic wireless Netflix screens that fit in their pockets are just better at that than PC&#x27;s are <i>and there&#x27;s nothing wrong with that.</i> It&#x27;s evolution, and even as a PC enthusiast and power user, I&#x27;m more than glad to see people better able to do what they enjoy.<p>That&#x27;s not to say I&#x27;ll be giving up my hand picked keyboard, large screen, and heavy tower, but I&#x27;m not to worried. There&#x27;s always going to be money in serving the needs of people who get work done on computers, even if it&#x27;s not quite as much money as it used to be.",1380161125

There was another post recently on HN that compared poverty to a rogue background process that drains willpower, and yet another one about how entrepreneurs are disproportionally from well-to-do backgrounds. You can&#x27;t take risks when you&#x27;re poor, you don&#x27;t have mobility, you can&#x27;t pay for childcare, you spend time clipping coupons instead of reading... the list goes on.",1380160898

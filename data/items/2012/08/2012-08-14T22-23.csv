A Web Developer or Web Engineer if you will, is the correct term for either Fron-End or Back-end. What used to be the ""web designer"" is a ""UI/UX designer"" nowadays which is fine I guess, but IMO a ""web designer"" that doesn't know at least HTML and CSS is no longer useful in the industry today. PSD2HTML is not the standard anymore.<p>Don't worry about the job description, if you think you're skilled for the job just apply anyway and lie about the stuff you don't know but you think you can learn. The problem with these job descriptions is that they're written by HR people that just copy/paste keywords and call it a day.

4383496,comment,4383159,4383415,1,0,dsrguru,,,"Do you mean because the syntax isn't sugary or because Lisp lends itself to a DSL-driven style of development where user-defined constructs are used more extensively than in any other language family?  If the former, I'd argue that's just because you're not used to looking at Lisp code.  If anything, its extreme concision should make visually parsing code faster than parsing equivalent code in other languages.<p>If the latter, pg makes a good argument in section 4.8 of <i>On Lisp</i>:<p>""So yes, reading a bottom-up program requires one to understand all the new operators defined by the author. But this will nearly always be less work than having to understand all the code that would have been required without them.<p>If people complain that using utilities makes your code hard to read, they probably dont realize what the code would look like if you hadnt used them. Bottom-up programming makes what would otherwise be a large program look like a small, simple one. This can give the impression that the program doesn't do much, and should therefore be easy to read. When inexperienced readers look closer and find that this isnt so, they react with dismay.""",1344984974
4383495,comment,4383159,4383159,15,0,KirinDave,,,"None of these applies to Clojure, and by and large Clojure basically obsoletes Ruby and Python unless you have concerns about the jvm startup time (which you can work around with Nailgun, but many people don't). No, seriously, Clojure is a uniform attack on everything of value in the Ruby, Python and Node.js world, only with fantastic performance and more flexible syntax.<p>Indeed, criticizing ""lisp"" is difficult because it isn't really clear what you mean. Common Lisp? Well that has a lot of work done for you. Scheme? That's deliberately minimalist because it's not meant for everyday work until you go outside the core spec (e.g., PLT Scheme's libraries). Clisp? MacLisp? What?<p>Lisp didn't take off because it didn't take off. There isn't some deep unconscious wisdom being tapped by the masses that we can read with tea leaves and subtlety. These things are random. There is a parallel universe not far from this one where Anic is a big deal and Pike took off in place of Python.<p>Because to assume otherwise that would imply that everyone knows every language and some are uniform winners over others. Do you know every language you have rejected? Heck, do you even know the general characteristics of Lisp, or Haskell, or ML, or Anic, or Pike, or APL? <i>No</i>, and to really try and learn all of them would take a lot of time unless you're quite gifted.

I wanted to overlay a transparent cache a la Proxy (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_pattern"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_pattern</a>, note its use of ""delegate"" in its description).<p>So I had implementations CachingRepo and DataStoreRepo, the first would cache recent calls and the latter would make real calls.

In a non-Lieberman delegation strategy, that B would always come from the data store, not my cache.<p>If I understand correctly, in Lieberman delegation getB() could return the cached values, because its ""self"" would point to the CachingRepo, not ""this"" in a Java sense.<p>It's not impossible to do this in Java, there's just not language support for it.

4383491,comment,4381087,4383205,1,0,alexqgb,,,"""Now - you didn't say as much - but I expect the argument you're leading to is that people who pirate books should be treated the same way as shoplifters. Which I think is a horrible idea. Not because pirating things is morally laudable, or authors don't deserve to get paid, but because the practicalities of detecting and enforcing that punishment would have drastic and damaging effects on the internet and innovation.""<p>This is something I'm acutely aware of and it's not what I'm getting at. I know that bringing panopticon style policing to the cultural sphere would be an unfathomable catastrophe. And though I didn't say so here, I've been long opposed to regarding unauthorized copies as ""stolen"" and that making them is, in itself, an act of theft - in large part because that line of reasoning invites such a horrific response.<p>But none of this changes the fact that when someone makes (not takes, but makes) a copy, they simultaneously generate an obligation to the author. If there is an act of theft involved, it pertains to the money owed to the author, and a person's keeping in his pocket something that, by rights, belongs in the author's. I mean, we can talk all we want about the infinite nature of intangible goods, and how this makes analogies with naturally limited physical goods absurd. But in doing so, we're narrowly focusing on the digital copy itself, and not the money - which is not in infinite supply - and which didn't change hands when it should have. Expanding the scope of discussion to include this amount makes the charge of theft less absurd that it is when applied to the copy alone. This is a subtle distinction, I admit, but that doesn't make it any less real.<p>Obviously, author's moral claims aren't unlimited. Fair Use, for instance, encompasses a set of situations in which a copy can be made without minting a corresponding obligation. This is a good and necessary thing. Indeed, I'm all for a significant expansion of what constitutes Fair Use. (Whatever else you may think of me, please don't mistake me for an advocate of the maximalist RIAA / MPAA positions.)<p>At the same time, I think the moral obligation to pay that comes with many, if not most copies, is something that's gotten very short thrift. Just because technology makes it easy to dodge this responsibility doesn't mean that it goes away. And if copyright as we've know it isn't a viable system any longer, then we need to come up with one that is.<p>Here, it's worth remembering that patronage usually involves much more risk than being a customer. This leads to a very different relationship with the artist than artists have with customers. After all, it's one thing to buy a ticket to a hit show. It's another to underwrite the costs of the theater company long before anyone knows how good the result will be. Generally speaking, being a patron means handing over money before the work in question exists. Being a customer means paying the artist after the fact. And unless you're covering the costs and obligations of bringing an existing work to a substantially wider audience, you can't claim to be underwriting something that already exists.<p>In many ways, it can be very liberating for artists to have the money they need up front. At the same time, this can limit where they go with it. A viable commercial market allows them to take chances a patron wouldn't underwrite, and do well if the bets they make pay off. This is another reason to keep the distinction between patron and customers very clear. Their effect on artists differs considerably, and I don't think one can be easily substituted for the other.",1344984898

Even a super simple SDK takes time to implement properly, and if it's only going to benefit a few percent of your users at best, I don't see why devs would bother; and if there isn't much support, gamers won't bite.<p>What bothers me the most is their belief that ""Real Games Need Real Buttons"". On the contrary, game devs seem to be doing perfectly well without buttons on smartphones, and customers don't seem to be complaining either, judging by the success of touch-native games like Angry Birds, Tiny Wings, Flight Control, Cut the Rope, etc. You might think that these aren't 'real games' but that's a remarkably narrow-minded opinion.<p>Regarding the price: the $42 coco is described as being ""less than stores"" which suggests a ~$50 price tag.

4383485,comment,4383233,4383233,4,0,btilly,,,"The td;lr of this post: this article is misguided according to usage, the history of the word ""delegation"", and the principles of good software design.<p>One of the points of design patterns is to define a common language.  The benefit of this is that it helps people understand one another.  The fact that delegation as discussed in GoF is what everyone understands delegation to be is good enough reason to continue using the word ""delegation"" that way and to force him to find a new word for what he wants to say.  Even if his definition was first.<p>But his definition was NOT first.  Sure, someone may have first used the term in OO programming in his sense of the word.  But the word ""delegation"" has long-standing usage in the English language.  It means, ""Doing this is now your responsibility.""  In English there is no automatic implication that the person to whom things are delegated necessarily has access to the person who did the delegating.  In practice, of course, there is.  Which is why the software analogs include that.  But in the real world it is clear when you intend to refer a question back to the original person, and when you do not.  Therefore the long established and universally understood definition does NOT indicate that the person to whom you delegate has the option of choosing to intercept any and all questions you ask.<p>So which behavior is preferable?.  If I delegate to you, and then need to be aware of all of the methods that you define, all of your methods, both public and private, become part of the surface of the API between us.  However the whole point of modularity is to have limited APIs between you and your components.  Enlarging the API may be easier and more convenient, but it entwines code into spaghetti and is bad for your code base.  So good software design says that of the two possible definitions of ""delegation"" we are comparing, we should prefer the one that makes it clear in the delegated to method when exactly it intends to go back to the delegated object versus when it is trying to send messages to itself.  And the version that does that is the version that the Gang of Four used.<p>Therefore he is wrong to say that delegation should be redefined to mean what he means.  He is wrong to say that his definition is better grounded in the history of the word ""delegation"".  And he's dead wrong that implementing his version of the word ""delegation"" is better software design than the current definition.",1344984714

Hence, a driver using a malicious Uber Driver app to report a few more blocks travelled on each trip is much less likely to be detected than a cabbie physically and obviously entering additional fees. I suspect Uber would find it difficult to prove that the driver's (fake) extra mileage wasn't actually rider-requested or an attempt to circumvent traffic - and I also suspect most riders won't notice.<p>Regular cabbies try the obvious, physical ""take the long way"" scam often enough that I suspect a hard-to-track digital form of the same idea isn't far off.",1344983695

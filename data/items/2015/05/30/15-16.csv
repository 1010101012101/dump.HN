Cases like rape X, where all of the evidence pointed to guy A. Then we test a known serial rapist, guy B, 30 years later to find out that he actually committed rape X. The Innocence Project sails in, and in due course guy A is exonerated and sent on his way after having spent 31 years in prison. We&#x27;re stuck with a sizable financial liability to the ex-prisoner. And for some reason, everyone calls this a happy ending ???<p>DNA was supposed to protect us from situations like that. But now you say that the evidence against guy A in rape X really would have been enough in any case... so we shouldn&#x27;t read too much into the fact that the DNA samples don&#x27;t match ???<p>I&#x27;m just confused as to what evidence would EVER prove guy A&#x27;s innocence in such a system ???",1433001382

9630548,comment,9625641,9628153,0,0,SoftwareMaven,,,"It&#x27;s more than that. Finding a real-world, compelling, useful product based on a new technology is much harder than just developing the technology. This is, of course, obvious, because in both cases, you will have to develop the technology. For one, the project ends at that point; for the other, some of the most challenging work is just getting started.<p>If you are responsible for developing a new technology, you can claim success if you release something that works as advertised, even if nobody actually uses it (&quot;it was ahead of its time&quot;, &quot;naysayers poisoned the market&quot;, etc.). Since there is no way to tell ahead of release whether it will succeed in the market, your project and, by extension, your position within the company creating it, are secure. Much, if not all, of the blame can be externalized.<p>On the other hand, if your goal is to release a usable product, you&#x27;ve just massively increased your personal exposure. First, you have to become very opinionated because any product that tries to please everyone generally succeeds in pleasing nobody, so that means there will be people who hate it, often before it is even released. Second, it is usually possible to tell if a product is useful before it actually releases (if you aren&#x27;t putting blinders on yourself), so you can find yourself in a position of failure before release, a failure that you cannot shift to anybody else.<p>Part of the reason the iPhone succeeded was because the person who, ultimately, was leading the project was the CEO. He wasn&#x27;t worried about what his boss thought, so the entire team could focus on the complete application. But that was only part.<p>The other reason is that the product, the way the technology would be used, was part of a feedback loop that influenced the technology itself. The advantage of taking on all that risk of failure is that you end up with technology that is better, technology that is more suited for solving real problems.",1433001072

For example, a money transmitters (as PayPal claims it is) are only supposed to transmit money from person A to person B transparently. However, PayPal routinely will hold funds or refund funds to a buyer without giving the seller notice or fair warning. Under banking regulations there would be more transparency to the seller and these types of incidents would slow or cease to exist is my understanding. If you have a $1000 in your bank account and walk into the bank to withdraw $500 the bank has to honor your request as long as the funds are available. With PayPal it can be a guessing game of whether the funds are available and there is no one there to answer why they are not available when they make the claim. Again, IANAL but that is my general understanding of the difference.<p>EDITED TO ADD: Also, as I understand it if someone hacks your bank account the bank has insurance and your funds are almost always refunded sometimes the same day. With PayPal if your account is hacked and you have a balance there you risk losing your money with PayPal not refunding any of it. PayPal most likely would tell you it is your fault.",1433000716

I wasn&#x27;t making claims about whether that should have been used in sentencing, so the fact that you keep harping on that is weird.<p>Second, the fact that he tried to hire murderers was material to the criminal conspiracy charges. So it&#x27;s not just &quot;a crazy rumor&quot; from the courts point of view.  The current way sentencing works is that evidence introduced in the trial can be used for sentencing as long as it meets some burden of proof , and this evidence was there and met that burden.<p>My gut reaction here is that the burden of proof should be higher (ie an actual conviction) and that the sentencing in question was highly inappropriate from a social standpoint, but I don&#x27;t have background in law to understand why the rules are the way they are.<p>At the same time I&#x27;m not going to rally behind a guy who incompetently tried to murder people as a way to express my distaste for the American justice system and the drug war. There is such a thing as picking your battles and this is not the hill I want to die on. I am aggrevated that people who share these views seem to be stuck on Ross and are trying to retconn away the evidence rather than pick a better battle to fight. There are myriads of drug war victims and avenues of tackling the problem, but we&#x27;re going to try to bang a square peg into a round hole here because the guy is a white upper-middle class programmer and we think Bitcoins and Dark Webs are cool?  Right.<p>The strongest statement I will make is that the life sentence is clearly unjust. People should be given second chances with very very few exceptions. Ross should be one of these people.",1433000365

Let&#x27;s assume that &quot;drugs&quot; means &quot;psychoactive drugs&quot;. In that case, I&#x27;d suggest that you can take a cup of coffee pretty much as close to 100% safely as is achievable for anything in the world that you can ingest. And coffee is psychoactive. So, it is possible to take drugs 100% safely.<p>Even alcohol can be taken safely: so long as you keep the dose low, and you&#x27;re not someone with a special sensitivity to it (e.g. an alcoholic), you can have a glass of red wine with pretty much zero chance of anything bad happening.<p>That also applies to all the other psychoactive drugs in between: speed, cocaine, LSD, heroin, mushrooms, peyote, MDMA, whatever. They can all be taken 100% safely. The key in <i>all</i> cases is always the same: good education and moderation.<p>All of these drugs can also be abused. You can kill yourself with caffeine too (though unlikely in coffee form - you&#x27;d need about 50-100 espresso shots). I recall a story of someone who ate a whole pack of caffeinated candy, thinking it was normal candy, and died.<p>Shit happens.<p>Shit happens more often without good research, education and clear guidelines.<p>Shit happens even more often without good research, education and clear guidelines, and with dodgy suppliers who may or may not be selling you the thing you think you&#x27;re buying because they&#x27;re all criminals.<p>The real culprit in every drug death?

I stay home from school because learning civics and history and math and science are super boring, so in between sessions of wallhacking on legacy counter-strike servers I refresh a startup tech news site looking for intellectually stimulating articles.<p>You're right. I do know everything. Everything except how best to use my time when I occasionally want to waste it broadening my horizon with unusual and interesting information. I typically walk around the house in underroos bragging about how bored I am. Then I zone out to American Idol.<p>I'm not sure what kind of parallel universe I'd have to exist in where writing about things I don't know anything about is possible, but once I find that reality, by golly I'll take your suggestion to heart.<p>Hackers really are the Thomas Edisons of our time. Extremely productive in everything they do and never piddling away on something just out of intellectual curiosity. Hackers only seem to create practical solutions to the big problems facing the world today. I'm so glad every college graduate who's just landed his first job writing JavaScript for a start-up can refer to themselves with such a prestigious title. And with so much credibility!<p>What I don't understand about your comment is that you seem to believe that <i>nobody</i> ever gets bored at work or needs a break from a grind of meetings, coding, red tape, conference calls, etc. I envy your steadfast dedication. I, however, do actually need a break once in a while and enjoy reading about things that are interesting and new to me, or just enlightening in some fashion.

3605579,story,,,4,3,eyeareque,"My first experience with web advertising (reddit and Facebook ads).",,"Recently I decided to partake in the AIDS/LifeCycle 2012 bike ride fundraiser. This event is a 7 day, 545 mile ride from San Francisco to Los Angeles. The event itself requires all participants to raise at least 3,000 (USD) dollars to participate in the ride. The event generates funds for SF and LA non-profits that help provide public services that our state is unable to provide.<p>My first online advertising attempt was to buy a 24 hour sponsored post on Reddit. These are the ads that show up in a darker blue color, at the top of the front page. This ad cost me $20 USD.<p>The post for my ad is here:<p>http://www.reddit.com/comments/pi1k4/hi_reddit_im_doing_a_7_day_545_mile_bike_ride_for/ which linked to my donation page (http://www.tofighthiv.org/goto/chrisb)<p>As you can see in the comments, at first I had a grammar fail that caused all the comments to be about my error (expected on reddit:) ). I emailed reddit to have the error mid way through the day. They were nice to take care of this as the website was giving me errors. It also seems that once you post an ad, you can't edit the topic text. This ad was shown across all subreddits.<p>Stats on the ad (reddit ad traffic page):
http://i.imgur.com/PNxgB.gif<p>Outcome of this ad:<p>I had one donation for $25 USD. This was great, I made five dollars more than if I had just donated the money I used for the ad directly. I had hoped for more, but I will take what I can get.<p>With the reddit ad you only have two choices on who sees them. One is to have it displayed on all subreddits, and the other is to display the ad on only specific subreddits. I would imagine that reddit is sitting on a stockpile of user data in the user posts that could be used to create profiles of the users which would help in targeting them. Maybe they can tell who is male and female, or maybe they could tell what your interests are based on the content of your posts? Someone who posts about ron paul all day might be a good target for opposing politicians who want to change their vote?<p>The facebook ad:<p>I found a $50 dollar coupon for facebook advertising so I figured I should give it a shot. I've ran the ad for a couple of days now. In contrast to my reddit ad, I decided to target specific groups of people.<p>facebook ad stats and info:
http://i.imgur.com/fDDZX.gif<p>From what I gather the CTR rate that I am seeing is extremely low. I'm sure a donation is less intriguing than most ads that are displayed so I am not too surprised.<p>Conclusion:<p>I've found that advertising a donation request is very unpopular. I almost wonder if it is possible advertise something like this with any success at all.<p>I wanted to post my experiences here for anyone else who has never used online advertising. It has been interesting to see how something as small as a choosing a contrasting color for a graphic can make a difference on how many clicks you get. I've learned a lot, and now have even more motivation to work on a project of my own (such as writing an iOS or Android app). I can imagine if advertising works well for someone, it could be addicting.<p>I'm very shocked to see how expensive a click is on facebook/google adwords. I know that I personally accidently click ads more often than I do so on purpose. I'd hope that there is a way to cancel these clicks out. I assume this might be hard to do technically.<p>Side comment:<p>Google AdWords: I had planned to pay for a Google ad but soon found out it would not be possible. The site that I wanted to link to is not a top level domain: www.domain.com but rather url with a path: http://www.tofighthiv.org/goto/chrisb After contacting google to see if there was another option I found out that there wasn't. They were generally helpful which is a contrast to the support experience I usually hear about Google.<p>My question:<p>Does anyone who is an expert in this area have any tips for me to make my advertising more successful? Are there any guides that are online? I'm most likely not going to be spending any more money on another ad (for my donation site anyway) unless I come up or find a good idea that could make the ad more effective.<p>Thanks.",1329525447

If using these services we would be very clear about privacy issues and options,giving our users the option of restricting their activities to our network, and not sharing the information with facebook/twitter if the user would choose not to. Also in our service agreement and in practice we would restrict our use of our users information to strictly what they share with us, not datamining them, which in my opinion violates peoples privacy.  There is a lot of upside in my opinion with using the Facebook/twitter login.  They are the 2 dominant social media platforms, in which our potential users are bound to have their strongest ties. If they choose to share their activities on our site with their social media network of choice, it would be their way of advertising a service they are using (and presumably enjoying if they are participating on the site), which would help our service attract users.

At over 100 pages, it will take a dedicated reader to sift the gold.</i><p>I defer to him who made a plea, for consultants' reports to become poetry: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUSLEJB9_LU"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUSLEJB9_LU</a><p>Perhaps, as _why's Poignant Guide, the poet goes too far: and then we lose too much substance. But 150 pages? <i>Au revoir</i>: there must be a cleaner, deeper essence. For I delight in the everyday code, which is fun, dramatic, sweeping, and wry, and manufactured examples of jQuery's road are nowhere as cool as an eval/apply.<p>The worst part is, he knows not what he does. For I opened him up to a random page, and saw what he said -- and I don't mean to fuss, but I can't help but feeling a little rage:<p><i>The Iterator Pattern is a design pattern where iterators (objects that allow us to traverse through all the elements of a collection) access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without needing to expose its underlying form.</i><p><i>Iterators encapsulate the internal structure of how that particular iteration occurs - in the case of jQuery's $(el).each() iterator, you are actually able to use the underlying code behind $.each() to iterate through a collection, without needing to see or understand the code working behind the scenes that's providing this capability. This is a pattern similar to the facade, except it deals explicitly with iteration.</i><p>No, my good sir, ten times no. The iterator pattern as was discussed (in <i>Design Patterns</i>, and such and so), has nothing to do with that construct. Iterators speak polymorphism out loud, freeing us from finities and the rest of the crowd. Let me illustrate with a simple collection of rational numbers -- in Cantor's bijection:<p><pre><code>    function gcd(lo, hi) {
        return lo > hi ? gcd(hi, lo) : lo === 0 ? hi : gcd(hi % lo, lo);
    }
    function rational_iterator() {
        var num = 0, denom = 1;
        return {
            hasNext: function () {
                return true;
            },
            next: function recurse() {
                var rat = [num, denom];
                if (denom === 1) {
                    denom = num + 1;
                    num = 1;
                } else {
                    denom -= 1;
                    num += 1;
                }
                return gcd(rat[0], rat[1]) === 1 ? rat : recurse();
            }
        };
    }
</code></pre>
And perhaps arrays are not quite your style, so you might like me to convert them to strings. That requires a new map method -- I'm not in denial -- but that's pretty simple in the grand scheme of things:<p><pre><code>    function map(seq, fn) {
        var i = 0;
        return {
            hasNext: function () {
                return seq.hasNext();
            },
            next: function () {
                return fn(seq.next(), i++);
            }
        };
    }
    var rationals_as_strings = map(rational_iterator(), function (x) { return x.join(""/""); });
</code></pre>

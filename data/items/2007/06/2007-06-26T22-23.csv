30949,comment,30341,30507,0,0,Tichy,,,"So how does flashlite manage to support all devices bug free? Do they just have better quality checks? Like phone might have differing sound chips or whatever, the VM has to account for it. Somehow I doubt that flashlight will be so much more successful than Java with portability?<p>Actually I think you can deploy Java on all Java devices, if you heed certain constraints. But then the application probably won't look very good and will lack some usability features (ie maybe you wouldn't use the soft-keys for navigation or you wouldn't use fullscreen mode, and no sound).<p>A big problem of mobile Java is the inconsistent font support, though - maybe if flashlights has better standards, it would be a huge improvement. With Java, you don't know how the fonts really look, and measuring the fonts dimensions is usually unreliable, too. So creating a decent layout is really difficult...",1182896821

30946,comment,30684,30703,0,0,ralph,,,"When taking a place on a six month contract with it to run on with two months' notice thereafter, I've made up for the lack of ""normality"", i.e. no employer salary cheque, etc., by paying the six months rent up front and then reverting to the normal monthly rent payment.  Every landlord so far has agreed.  It may help to think of ways you can persuade a landlord, and often than means paying more money (the interest I lost -- not much).",1182896114
30945,comment,30581,30702,0,0,pg,,,"What YC does, we have to do in person.  Kind of like a university.  So founders have to at least be able to get here for the 3 months.  They could return to their home country after that, but they'd be more likely to succeed if they stayed in the US-- partly because it's a better environment for startups, and partly because it would be easier for us to help them.",1182896104

30943,comment,30853,30853,0,0,webwright,,,"I like it (the web site and the ""feel"" of the product-- didn't try the product, but I'd like to).<p>I'd get a copywriter to review your site (one who specializes in persuasive writing for the web).  The value prop is clear, but if you're selling language, you ought to nail your message.  Phrases like ""quickly gain thousand+ words"", ""ingolingo is the steroid of learning language"", and ""When he's not practising martial arts, he's at a social event talking with other clever people"" are awkward.<p>While I like it, the design feels a tad soft/feminine (why the flowers?) - what are the demographics of people who want to learn new languages?  Might be interesting to ponder color psychology...  Is the design/color selection based off of what you guys like?  Or what the target audience will respond to?  I dunno the right answer, but it's worth pondering.<p>Out of curiosity, why isn't the app web-based?  You probably have access to these stats, but I'd be interested in how many referrers you got from YCNews and what percentage of them downloaded your app and tried it?  I bet that percentage would double if it was web-based.<p>It's nitpicky, but I'd adjust your brown link color in the footer... Hard to recognize as a link.",1182895900

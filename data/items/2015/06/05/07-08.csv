Last time I checked, their plan was to reserve some of the more dangerous features (such as access to the camera) for secure websites. Hardly a plan to drop support for plaintext HTTP.<p>So basically, by your own admission, you say that websites with a near-future version of Firefox will only be able to offer a &quot;full&quot; web-experience if they are offered via HTTPS.<p>HTTP-based websites will be reserved for an inferior web.<p>> Classic slippery slope argument.<p>But somehow saying that this is moving in a HTTPS-only direction is a slippery slope argument? How long until Javacript is only allowed via HTTPS? How long until video  and media-APIs will only work with a &quot;secure&quot; DRMed connection, signed by the MPAA?<p>Taking HTTPS everywhere and removing support for HTTP is the slippery slope and we&#x27;re already walking it.<p>Every feature of every part of the HTML spec has to be supported for every transport. End of discussion.<p>HTTPS everywhere is a misguided effort. Trying to artificially limit HTTP to further your cause is just GOT-level political bullshit. Stop playing dishonestly. If HTTPS everywhere can&#x27;t win through on its own merits, you should let it die.",1433491170

Also, since HTTP/2 requires TLS, ISPs can&#x27;t read the stream priority (or anything else within the stream) even if they wanted to.<p>Also, HTTPS costs should be minimal for startups (in fact, they should be more significant if you are the size of Amazon). For instance, if you use Amazon Cloudfront, the price difference between serving one million requests over HTTPS vs one million requests over regular HTTP is at most 60 cents in any AWS region.",1433491002

Most Americans know somebody with a union job. Most don&#x27;t feel too strongly about being in one or not. It&#x27;s just part of the job.<p>That said, talking to Americans in union jobs often gets you tales of dysfunction. My mother was in a nurse&#x27;s union for a quarter-century. (She&#x27;s since gone to business school and taken a non-union job.) Her dinnertime stories were absurd. Representatives constantly squabbled about petty things. They negotiated pay scales based on seniority instead of performance. Ditto for scheduling. Older nurses got to work days, while younger nurses (often still raising kids) were stuck with night shifts. Incompetent nurses were paid the same as proficient ones, and firing was quite rare. The whole situation led to more stress and hostility than seemed worthwhile. So why didn&#x27;t my mother leave the nurse&#x27;s union? Because she&#x27;d lose her job. The union had negotiated a deal requiring union membership for employment at that hospital.<p>I hope unions are better elsewhere, but here they often do little more than discourage good workers while protecting bad ones.<p>1. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_unions_in_the_United_States#Labor_unions_today"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_unions_in_the_United_Stat...</a>",1433490156

Given the many problems with SSL (heartbeat, broken/outdated certs, hijacked cert vendors) an HTTP/2 without SSL would be a nice fallback scenario - wildcard certs for new startups are still a bit expensive, especially if one will have to replace (=costs) the certs every few months due security concerns. Even the largest commerce website Amazon.com only uses HTTPS for a tiny little fraction, the payment dialog page (which requires with its separate login).<p>It seems HTTP/2 is good for big companies that operate centralized services to save traffic. Whereas the current HTTP 0.x and HTTP 1.x is proven to be good enough for everyone. There is a threat that some popular web services might get HTTP/2-only access in a few years.

But, I don&#x27;t think you would say Android hasn&#x27;t been a very successful bet for Google, despite the fragmentation and huge range of quality for different mobile devices, and the problems with branding they have.  What I&#x27;m seeing is Valve trying to make the exact same play in the console world, where Microsoft and Sony have it locked down very much the same way Apple did (or was on the way to doing) with the smartphones. They want to break people out of those walled gardens and bring them into their ecosystem, and they&#x27;re going to provide an open platform for any hardware maker to do it, just like Android did.<p>Of course mobile phones and consoles are two different industries, it might play out in a similar way or it might play out completely differently.  But I think it&#x27;s a bit premature to write it off as ridiculous or even a bad idea from the start when there is precedent for this sort of strategy working in other industries.  It certainly has a chance of playing out well for Valve, branding and fragmentation be damned, as long as it opens up a much larger audience to Steam.",1433489673

Typically, they&#x27;re structured as one worker, one vote, and I think what typically happens is:<p>- The union asks for workers to be paid above market rate. The company, of course, has limited resources. So the company agrees to pay union members more, but at the expense of newly hired workers, who aren&#x27;t in the union and so don&#x27;t get a vote. The end result is that, after a few decades of this, pay is based entirely on seniority and no one has a reason to do good work.<p>- The union asks for more benefits. The company, again, has limited resources. So the company and the union agree to lavish retirement plans, which will only have high costs decades later, after the majority of current workers have retired. When the company goes bankrupt and restructures retirement, the newer workers get screwed, but they weren&#x27;t working there at the time and so didn&#x27;t get to vote on it. The management who agreed to the expensive plans is sitting pretty, despite having bankrupted the company, since they are typically older and are now retired too.<p>- A lousy worker&#x27;s vote counts just as much as a good one&#x27;s. On the other hand, a good worker who might replace the lousy worker isn&#x27;t employed at that company, and so doesn&#x27;t get a vote. Hence, the union gradually creates protections that make current workers almost impossible to fire, while good workers who might replace them remain out of a job.<p>(Examples available ad nauseam.)<p>It&#x27;s what you&#x27;d expect from democracy, really - if you give the vote to everyone in a group and nobody outside, that group will enrich itself at the expense of everyone not currently in it. (This is, I suspect, why most Western countries have such horrible immigration policies.)<p>If Sweden&#x27;s found a way to fix these problems while still having unions, that&#x27;s great, but I don&#x27;t think Americans have yet.<p>EDIT: There are American unions, like the Screen Actors Guild, that seem like exceptions to this.

We can no longer hope to tame hardware with meticulous control over instructions as we were able to up until the nineties.<p>Forget about clever compilers; forget even about smart JITs; even if you look at such a big abstraction as GCs and only consider large pauses (say anything over a few tens of milliseconds), it is now the case that in a well-tuned application using good a GC, most large pauses aren&#x27;t even due to GC, but to the OS stopping your program to perform some bookkeeping. Careful control over the instruction stream doesn&#x27;t even let you avoid 100ms pauses, let alone trying to control nanosecond level effects.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.infoq.com/presentations/click-crash-course-modern-hardware"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.infoq.com/presentations/click-crash-course-modern...</a>",1433488378

54621,comment,54522,54607,0,0,randallsquared,,,"Even the ""global warming skeptics"" aren't actually skeptical about the fact that warming has been happening.  Rather, they're skeptical that there's a sudden uptick in the last few decades, and/or that global warming as it exists is human-caused.<p>It's well understood that several hundred years ago, it was colder (at least in the northern hemisphere), simply because of historical records we have that don't make much sense otherwise.  Also, it's well understood (though recently challenged) that it was warmer than twentieth century levels  before that for some amount of time.  <p>So the controversy is all over whether humans are causing any significant part of the warming that is currently happening, and whether that can or should be fixed by reducing greenhouse gas levels.",1189785357

54616,comment,54526,54526,0,0,danteembermage,,,"This reminded me of a keynote speech at the dynamical systems conference at Snobird a few years back about the limits of computational mathematics, i.e. the human limits of asking the wrong question.<p>The aged speaker was apparently a consultant for the British transportation authority; they wanted a model that would optimize their highway expenditure to put the money where it would do the most good along multiple criteria, time on the road, overall budget effects, safety, etc.<p>The team spent a significant amount time getting all the dynamic pieces of the model to interact and then started running solutions. Strangely though, no matter what reasonable weights or parameters they threw at it, it always recommended pedestrian safety expenditure of zero.<p>After a lot of puzzling they finally figured out what was going on. You see, a significant portion of the pedestrians on English crosswalks were aged pensioners. Since the model incorporated overall budget effects into its preferences, every dollar spent on pedestrian safety lead to the decreased risk of accidental death of net-revenue-drain individuals, i.e. little old ladies walking to the corner shop. So the models did an excellent job of solving the wrong problem, GIGO.<p>Likewise, actual time spent from start to finish is most definitely not the same at perceived time from start to finish, with the second probably being to most important. Which, in case you didn't know, is why hotel elevators almost invariably have mirrors on either side of the door, you reflection gives you something to do other than thinking about how long your elevator is taking, a considerably cheaper solution than trying to solve the computational problem of maximal overall trip efficiency.<p>That said I'm totally jealous they get paid to play with that problem. If I were there I'd be like the guys in the arm chairs from the Collins College advertisements doing the ""dude, I can't believe we get paid to play games!""",1189784894

54612,comment,54556,54556,0,0,mxh,,,"A bit o/t, but I hereby nominate 'serial', as applied to 'entrepreneur' and/or 'founder', as the most pointless, irritating, and obnoxious word of 2007.<p>You don't describe someone who works a bunch of jobs as a 'serial employee'.  You don't describe an athlete who competes in successive Olympics as a 'serial Olympian'.  Etc.<p>This 'serial' business is nothing more than noise and puffery.  'Entrepreneur' tells me something, though not much.  'Successful entrepreneur' tells me a tiny, tiny bit more.  'Serial entrepreneur' tells me someone is a self-promoting git.<p>I even saw this term applied to PG in an article some weeks ago.  Considering that PG has repeatedly written that a startup is kinda stressful, and something he'd be very reluctant to do again, I think that marked the time the term slipped into complete meaninglessness for me.  (Note that PG didn't refer to himself that way, 'twas the idiot writer/reporter.)<p>Let's drop the adjective, and shun those who use it.<p>/rant

54606,comment,54543,54543,0,0,byrneseyeview,,,"This makes a lot of sense. When you invest in a stock, your returns aren't just financial: buying shares of a solar power company pays a dividend in pretension (sort of like buying Amazon in 1999; it wasn't the money -- it was the .com). Since these stocks have a negative 'dividend' in the sense that nobody wants to admit to owning them, they offer higher returns to compensate.<p>Peter Lynch recommended this with garbage haulers and coffin manufacturers.

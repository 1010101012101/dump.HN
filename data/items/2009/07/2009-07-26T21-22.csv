724936,comment,724539,724851,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"I would far rather use this than code. I've mentioned <a href=""http://synthmaker.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://synthmaker.co.uk/</a> (which includes code modules) before. For many applications the procedural emphasis of code may not be the best approach. I like Yahoo's Pipes tool for the same reason. DSP and (to some extent) circuit board designers use these kind of schematic, flow based applications a lot - it's basically the same idea as analog computing.<p>Remember flowcharts? If you're trying to do something complicated, a good way to approach it is sketch it visually and then refer back to your information or decision flow chart while punching in the code. When I first learned programming I thought how nice it would be to just draw the flowcharts in and build the program that way, but that would have been far too computationally intense. This is no longer the case.<p>Frankly, I'd rather let the computer do the work. I also grew up with log tables and slide rules (as well as walking up hill to and from school), and a prime joy of having a computer was to be able to automate much tedious pencil-and-paper calculation. To me, writing code is the tedious crap one has to do to implement ideas that are often most easily represented in schematic form. Ugly and flawed though these tools may seem at present, they seem vastly preferable to <i>typing</i> everything.<p>These questions remind me a bit of discussions about Emacs/Vi vs (your favorite modern IDE). Of course you can do truly amazing things in editors like Emacs. Just as people who knew Wordtsar* and WordPerfect could churn out documents at high speed with their advanced knowledge of key combinations. Just like with TeX or CSound you can produce amazingly specific renderings of typography or music, and where experts with these tools can wipe the floor with those namby-pamby WYSIWYG tools...and yet the vast majority of people are happy with the WYSIWYG tools and get more stuff done, because most people are not sufficiently masochistic as to want everything as abstracted as possible.<p>* accidental misspelling that was too good to correct :)<p>Of course, doing it the easy way means one will never be as hard core as someone who has mastered the techniques of working with high degrees of abstraction. On the other hand few programmers seem consumed by a burning urge to throw away their high level languages and libraries and hand-code everything in assembler, or hardware designers casting aside spice and breadboards in favor of writing out bessel equations for everything.<p>Tools like this can seem clumsy and restrictive at first, but all that's happening is that you're learning to deal with a visual grammar rather than one based on keywords and syntax. The underlying concepts of programming are just as portable and useful, and if you stick with it you might be surprised at how much a tool like this can do for your productivity. You will certainly find it a hell of a lot easier to see what is going than reading page of code for all but the simplest tasks.<p>tl;dr don't mistake your personal investment of time and effort for the best way of doing things.",1248645536

But job loss, at it's heart, is mostly just companies gauging how many employees they'll need for the future and making adjustments.  So if every news agency is telling these companies we're at the start of a great depression what else would you expect them to do but to cut jobs at an even higher rate?<p>How many tech companies have we seen in the last year who cut jobs before they even noticed a revenue drop?

Lets look at why...<p>The iPhone is a computer. A pretty one, that can run lots of shiny, pretty apps covered in gradients. When people see it, they are immediately aware of how hip the person wielding it is. Apple took everything great about their desktop computers (pretty, fashionable, stable, simple) and condensed them all into a small, even more fashionable, even more convenient, simple package called an iBook. Coffee shop dwellers wielding an iBook could let their fellow caffeine-solution enjoyers just how hip they were, just how PRODUCTIVE they were with their wonderful macbooks.<p>Then came the iPhone. Apple took all the wonderful things about their desktops (stability, simplicity, etc.) plus all the wonderful things about their notebooks (simple, fashionable) and combined them into a wonderful even MORE portable packaged called an iPhone. This iPhone could be carried in its owner's pocket. The look-at-me oppurtunities were endless. People could admire the superior technical prowess (complete with white apple logo displayed in stark contrast the black case on the back of the thing) of iPhone users on the train, or on the bus, or on the sidewalk, or in a coffee shop, or the office, or in the kitchen, at a restaurant...ANYWHERE!<p>A tablet, however...what does this supposedly offer that the iPhone doesn't? It isn't as mobile, meaning less oppurtunites for look-at-me, it would likely run Mac OSX or some derivative of it.. meaning a hefty tax to the apple gods...it would undoubtedly be covered in ultra-high-gloss plastic, meaning that any hopes of replacing something like a panasonic toughbook would be seriously mis-guided.<p>The only market that apple has not yet tried to dominate, and that it is in any sort of position to even enter, is netbooks.<p>They had a sort-of false-start called the MacBook Air, something that I think everybody would agree is an example of just how much of a failure apple can produce.<p>The next itteration of the iPhone is, most certainly, a netbook. The question is whether or not apple is willing to forfeit its position as a luxury item in exchange for increased penetration. A sub-300-dollar netbook is something that is likely NOT in apple's future.<p>Apple has got something really great going for them right now. People WANT an apple. Macs are seen as something that is, in some way, better than their windows-based counterparts. Even Microsoft seems to be willing to admit this in their latest ads.<p>In conclusion, apple will NOT be creating a tablet; it simply does not follow with the current trend of their products. If anything, they will produce a $500 netbook that is still seen as ""better"" than its competitors. If this happens, I predict low market penetration and ultimate failure.",1248643012

It's SHIT!"", he screamed while throwing his hands into the air.<p>I walked into his department and had him show me, on one of the other machines (which had MS office installed) what he was trying to do.<p>I then walked over to his machine and pressed LITERALLY the exact same series of menus and buttons to get EXACTLY the same result.  (it was excel vs OO.o calc).<p>He had never even tried.<p>Perhaps I should start lying to my users and telling them that Open Office costs $1000 per seat.

Most people don't realize how close BeOS came to becoming Mac OS X. They had the inside track on the deal, and their OS was technically superior to Next's. But Gassée's determination to hold out for more money combined with the famous Steve Jobs reality distortion field to consign Be to the dustbin of history and cleared the way for Jobs's second coming at Apple. How different the tech world would be today if Gassée had said yes to Apple's initial acquisition offer.

Keeping the mind open to alternative methods is crucial to the evolutionary progression of computer applications and many other matters in general. While replicating the prior art of other applications may be the safest route to ensure users understand how to use your product, it also limits the possible competitive advantages that may be discovered while developing your application.

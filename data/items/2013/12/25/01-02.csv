6961910,comment,6960539,6961868,1,0,marquis,,,"I think all knowledge workers should note what they did at the end of the day - it helps with accountability and gives a sense of achievement. For example a tool like idonethis.com helps you and everyone stay up-to-date and see quickly where problems are. Or ask everyone to just email you at the end of the day or a fixed period. Always read them and respond if needed.<p>You note that you feel you are slowing your team down - if it&#x27;s because you are relied on to be building core tasks, try building mock-ups first so they can work. Another good tool is apiary.io if you work with APIs for example: it combines fleshing out your API with actually providing a functional framework so the front-end guys can get to work.<p>If it&#x27;s documentation slowing you down, give everyone some days off or get them on another task and catch up. Use paper and pen or whiteboarding or a design tool like Flairbuilder if you need to really understand your ideas before trying to explain them to someone else.",1387936774

He&#x27;s been able to skip those and spend his time more productively on problems that i haven&#x27;t encoutered or solved yet.<p>This is one thing teachers are really good for!<p>I&#x27;m sure some students would figure out not to sure GOTO after awhile, but, well, think of all those wasted years! Easier to just explain to them the problems upfront!<p>>  I managed to get another developer with little Perl experience to nearly my level within 6 months by handing him two excellent books and reading his code and pointing out issues in his algorithms and semantics.<p>Part of this is natural ability as well. I have a friend who much to my dismay is not a software engineer, but who only dabbles.<p>I was able to explain lambdas and closures to him in a couple of minutes over IM, and he was almost immediately able to see their uses.<p>Meanwhile, I know experienced software engineers who cannot fathom the purpose of a Lambda, and a few friends I know who are just not intelligent enough (?) to comprehend on a deep level how lambdas and closures work.<p>Now all this said, the college professor who was supposed to teach us functional programming did such as piss poor job at it that I ended up not understanding basic FP concepts until I started using them in C# and reading about how they are implemented in the CLR. (Part of this is because Eric Lippert is a damn good writer...)<p>I think the text book we had at the time defined them solely in terms of mathematical constructs. Ugh.",1387936684

6961891,comment,6959533,6959533,1,0,yeukhon,,,"I am just an undergraduate, so what the heck do I know about agile in big project. Please feel free to critique. What do guys from big projects have to say?<p>Here is how I imagine people arguing about agile vs water fall.<p>WF: It probably will take the same amount of hours and people to hash system together in agile, making sure all components are integrated properly without a strong and detail system requirements.<p>AG: But you don&#x27;t wait until the end to test your software and wait until the end to discover shit and changes. You can iteratively change stuff.<p>WF: Ah. Fine. I will just tell my co-workers to test more often. Now, you agile people just want everything to be short-term. How do you ensure people don&#x27;t block other teams from completing works? you see when blockers appear, the time requires for completion is the same as everything done at once.<p>AG: But if you finish 80% while waiting on the 20% to block forever, you still have 80% done. Plus, in agile you have some short term and long term goals. You order them by importance and blocker. When the whole sprint is blocked, just do more testing and making sure existing systems are working as said.<p>WF: Fine. Now what about people going monkey on their own? The point of water fall is to ensure no one is outside the design and minimize risk. Now everyone goes agile and shit going to come because some teams are not playing nice.<p>AG: This is a tough problem. But the only way out is by scrum, well, at least meeting daily or weekly. The benefit of agile plus regular meeting is that everyone knows what the heck is going on and changes can be made. Once you made a specification forever, it&#x27;s hard to change.<p>WF: But it is the same in agile that a chance can be tough to make because people didn&#x27;t make the right decision at one of the early sprints.<p>AG: Yeah. That certainly is. I won&#x27;t lie agile people don&#x27;t make that easier. But I argue it is easier if you just work on smart parts.<p>WF: Are you sure it will work for multiple-billion dollars project? With a lot of legal blockers and a lot of other software to work with? You need to do a thorough analysis. You need to conduct research how existing healthcare registration works, find out the pros and cons. That&#x27;s a lot of time. Now if you go agile, you will just keep doing research.<p>AG: ....<p>YEUKHON: I will fill in the blanks, but hey what the heck do I know about big project software engineering. I think agile doesn&#x27;t require people to start right away. Agile just ensure nothing blocks forever and that goals are more or less short-terms. it is always required one to have good knowledge of how existing solutions works. So if you need to find out how to integrate the new healtcare.gov with the rest of the solutions out there, do that research first. Obviously you can&#x27;t just develop a site like a baby punching keyboard, hoping the baby compose some legendary music. It takes real talent to do that. So I say myth buster, agile still requires professionals to do priori research, have lengthy discussions about how to go about implementing the system, give a pretty good sketch about how things supposed to work, and then go off and start implementing something. But don&#x27;t come up with the full solution so detail that you ought to obey that contract.<p>WF: Yeah, but your client is spending 100 millions and this is impacting tens of millions of people. Any example out there like healthcare.gov did finish on time and running successfully using agile? I know WF sucks, but real examples of agile out there? You know, people tend to do a lot of talking and sketching when they are working with so many people and so many things involved. &quot;Oh Bob and his teams are doing research on existing solutions works and my team is working on consumer APIs? Okay, let&#x27;s talk about what fields we want, what schema we want in the database, etc&quot;",1387936311

6961872,comment,6961263,6961263,2,0,6d0debc071,,,"It doesn&#x27;t surprise me. If you assume that the school system doesn&#x27;t exist. And I asked you how you think people learn best and to design a system around it, this is not how you&#x27;d do it.<p>Several major points spring to mind:<p>1) Learning - once you&#x27;re done with route-memorisation nonsense - is the process of discovering that what you assumed was wrong or incomplete. What&#x27;s standardised testing? The punishment of being wrong or giving an answer that&#x27;s more or less complete than the tester wanted.<p>It&#x27;s hardly surprising that a culture that grows around punishing failure would be hostile to learning.<p>There&#x27;s research backing that up. We know that people who are rewarded for finding out that they&#x27;re wrong, over time, start to <i>dramatically</i> outperform people who are rewarded for finding out that they&#x27;re right. The former group continually seek to find out that they&#x27;re wrong, which they can only do by pushing the boundaries, the latter group largely stick to what they already know.<p>2) Effort can only take you so far in anything. This is a common enough theme here that can probably stand without support. No-one wants to hire someone who doesn&#x27;t like the job, we expect them to do everything half-arsed. It&#x27;s not going to be magically different for education.<p>So, what are the odds that someone&#x27;s going to be deeply interested in everything? I&#x27;ve never met such a person. I&#x27;ve met people who are happy enough to listen but they don&#x27;t go off and learn about the subject on their own afterwards.<p>What&#x27;s even the expected return on making everyone learn everything? We need a few generalists, granted, but we&#x27;ll get a few generalists anyway from people who are interested in multiple subjects. Someone who doesn&#x27;t enjoy maths, what&#x27;s the point of making them learn trig, or linear algebra? What&#x27;s the point in making someone who wants to be a Scientist take art? Can it even be said to be learning if they&#x27;re just doing it because they have to? Skills that aren&#x27;t practised wither. I&#x27;ve met people who got quite reasonable GCSE results, at some point they were able to do the things in the subjects they got, and can&#x27;t even work out a percentage anymore. Give them a basic grounding; add up, divide, work out a percentage; and the rest? Not their problem. They&#x27;re not going to learn it properly in the first place and it&#x27;s questionable how much use they&#x27;d have out of it if they did.<p>The vast majority of the time spent on someone&#x27;s education is just pointless filler subjects that do little more than punish someone with boredom and failure. Offering no economic or cultural benefit in return. Just try having a discussion with someone about the underlying causes of the Opium Wars, or the Boer Wars, or ask them why World War 1 started, or... Then try having a discussion with them about the religious practices of Buddhists, or Jews. There&#x27;s a very limited set of living knowledge in most people - far beneath that which you&#x27;d expect just going off of exam results and taught subjects. The two should approach each other, and it seems to me the logical way to do this is to reduce taught knowledge unless an economic or cultural case can be made for attempting to run things in the other direction.<p>3) This ties into 2 but is a little different: We have utterly no respect for diversity. The downside of having a standardised grade system is that there&#x27;s a cutoff point where investing more in a student stops being worthwhile. You have a student getting a B, do you focus on getting them up to an A or do you focus on getting the D student up to a C so that they count in your students getting A-C stats? You have a student getting an A, do you work to further engage them or do they just cease to be worth your time? It makes far more sense, under that incentive system, to focus that effort on the people who are under-performing - and who will probably not retain and go on to use the knowledge.<p>The consequence of having a set test is you have teaching set to the test. You have a space of things that you expect people to know, and they may fill it to various degrees but at the end of the day if you take a group of people that achieved good results, they&#x27;re all going to know more or less the same stuff.<p>Strength in groups comes from diversity, new ways of looking at things, new questions, different answers. Over specialisation creates weaknesses - cultural blind-spots. If you know the same as me, then I don&#x27;t need you as anything more than something to carry out my orders. You make me stronger only in so far as you&#x27;re an instrument of my will. There&#x27;s no point having a discussion with you, because you&#x27;d only be able to tell me what I already know.<p>Of course we all go on to live very different lives, so this effect becomes less pronounced with age. Nonetheless, it&#x27;s a major screw up.<p>4) A lot of your success in the current education system seems to hinge on your ability to visualise yourself enjoying future rewards and the reinforcement you get at home. There seem likely to be differences in people&#x27;s brains in terms of how well they can be motivated by the potential of future rewards and lots of people have really shitty home lives. Ideally the reinforcement would take place in the classroom as per 1.<p>-------------------------------<p>So, let&#x27;s wool-gather a bit: In really broad strokes, what qualities would we like an education system to have?<p>Help every child achieve their own strengths.<p>Things that are immediately rewarding, preferably in the social sense.<p>Things that allow people to experience environmental mastery.<p>Some structure for people who lack the ability to self motivate.<p>So:\nNo set classes that someone has to be in.<p>No set subjects beyond the very basics.<p>Optional projects (preferably group projects) rather than tests.<p>How might that look?<p>A child goes into school and is presented with a number of groups that are running around projects at the time. Want to try building a robot? They try putting a robot together, discover they need to understand more about maths, go see the maths teacher. They need to learn more about programming, go see the programming teacher. They need to learn about machining, they go see the design teacher. And there&#x27;s a teacher overseeing the project, sharing in their success, urging them on.<p>Under that sort of system teachers become more coaches and advisers than they are the current lecturers and punishers.<p>Or - a child can go into school and opt for more or less the current set up. The maths teacher isn&#x27;t going to be advising all the time after all. There&#x27;d be more time to focus on those children who want more guidance in their education... though to a certain extent the requirements of projects would <i>impose</i> structure in the knowledge that people were obliged to seek out. (I&#x27;m honestly not sure this is good for people, you will have to self-direct when you get out of education, but I&#x27;m not sure enough to head it off completely and I don&#x27;t see a point in ruling it out - you could adjust the system later if it turned out to be a poor use of resources / those people were massively disadvantaged.)<p>...<p>Objections?<p>But where will the money come from?<p>It&#x27;s actually not clear to me that this would be more expensive than the current system. Resources are currently pretty cheap, infrastructure for making things for projects is a one time cost that when you average it out&#x27;s going to be pretty much negligible. It&#x27;s not clear you&#x27;d need to employ <i>more</i> teachers.<p>But what about bad teachers?<p>Well, they&#x27;re a problem that the current system shares too. They&#x27;re just more readily apparent in this system. Which is good. Hire, train and fire - if someone&#x27;s not living up to expectations - should be a fairly quick cycle.<p>What you&#x27;re essentially saying when you&#x27;re worried about the quality of teachers under such a system is that a child is going to run into the limitations of what the teacher knows, or that the teacher&#x27;s not going to be bothered to spend time on them. Which is either fantastic or extremely worrying, but in any case is a clear signal in a way that waiting until they get their GCSE results isn&#x27;t.<p>But if people don&#x27;t take tests how do we assess them for work?<p>Well, look, two years out the gate it doesn&#x27;t make a dang bit of difference for most things that you might want to do what your education was. I&#x27;m a Philosopher by education. I&#x27;ve worked in public policy research, sales, programming.... What&#x27;s important is what jobs you&#x27;ve had and how well you&#x27;ve done them. Education should be approached in the same way. What did you do and how well did you do it? Write about your education on your CV as if it were another job and list your achievements. Not only is it less perverse for you it tells the person reading the thing a lot more about you. Fifteen years of work should not be summed up as &#x27;GCSEs including English A, Science A and Maths A.&#x27; But that&#x27;s how I see it on a lot of CVs.<p>#<p>Mind you, I&#x27;m not saying that a system you made up <i>would</i> look like this. There are probably a number of ways it could go, and a number of flaws that would need tuning. I&#x27;m just saying that if you start off thinking about how you&#x27;d teach people I end up in dramatically different places to the current school system - and consequently I&#x27;m not surprised in the least to learn that the school in OP&#x27;s link doesn&#x27;t seem to be doing any worse than comparable schools in the area. When you start looking at the paths not taken, it&#x27;s like that for a lot of things.",1387935646

Right off the bat, we&#x27;d expect their educational achievement to be higher, simply down to social class, which is directly correlated. So we can establish that educational attainment at this school is in line with other private schools.<p>This being the case, the conclusion we can draw from this school is: &quot;children with middle-class parents who are involved in their education can achieve better outcomes than the public school average when they attend well-funded private schools, even with an alternative educational model.&quot; Phrased like that, if&#x27;s pretty obvious.<p>The Sudbury model is also not the claimed &quot;educational environment where the students can do what ever they want, when ever they want all day long&quot; - that&#x27;s a bit of a misrepresentation. It&#x27;s an educational environment where children are provided the tools and support to plan their own education, and are required to be involved in that process.<p>I absolutely, thoroughly believe that the Sudbury model is an excellent approach to providing a much more well-rounded education for children. However, it requires lots of funding, excellent educators, and is arguably not any more suitable for every child than the current flawed system is.<p>Formal education and curricula are something I found exceptionally useful as a child, though I of course recognise the limitations there, and I&#x27;m pretty envious of the Sudbury model. But I wonder if a more general-purpose model may be effective. I attended a state comprehensive school in the UK, but had a couple of excellent teachers who were happy to provide materials and support for additional or alternative self-directed learning in areas where it was obvious I was bored or disinterested. That worked really well, and I can totally see that a basic curriculum and standardised attainment, combined with flexible opportunities for students who want to take more control of their learning, could be very effective.<p>Of course, all of this relies of excellent, well-paid educators.

I&#x27;m not entirely convinced by this though:<p>> [A signed commit] doesn&#x27;t guarantee anything about the contents of that commit if the repository has been tampered with.<p>I think most people would intuitively expect the signed commit to guarantee the contents of the tree being signed.  The idea that you could &quot;git pull&quot; a repo from a compromised machine, verify the signed commit, but not actually have a guarantee about the tree matching the one that was signed would run counter to most people&#x27;s expectations, I suspect.<p>In other words, this to me seems like a &quot;technically, we don&#x27;t guarantee&quot; statement about something that is <i>de facto</i> thought to be guaranteed.",1387934239

It would for example, make no difference to the workings of git if you could reverse-engineer the contents of an object from its SHA1. In the same way, it doesn&#x27;t matter much to the operation of git that you can generate collisions for SHA1, though if you were running into collisions all the time, it would make everyday usage difficult.<p>> if git&#x27;s SHA1 content-addressable design is not crypto, how do you distinguish crypto from software like git that uses cryptographic primitives for useful purposes?<p>If I&#x27;m understanding you correctly, software that &quot;uses cryptographic primitives for useful purposes&quot; is usually trying to guarantee one or more of the following:<p>* Confidentiality - Keeping data secret<p>* Integrity - Making sure data hasn&#x27;t been tampered with<p>* Authentication - Making sure that the person you think sent the data is in fact the person who sent the data.<p>* Non-repudiation - Ensuring that the person who sent the data can&#x27;t deny that they in fact sent the data.<p>Git makes guarantees about none of the above in its usage of SHA1. You could argue that it makes a guarantee of integrity in its content addressable file store, but it doesn&#x27;t. If you can modify the files in the .git/ directory, you can screw up the repository to your hearts content. There&#x27;s no way to do so remotely, i.e. by creating and pushing a Git commit with an existing SHA1. You typically protect Git from local tampering by only allowing access via SSH, which has plenty of crypto in it.<p>When it <i>does</i> make guarantees about authentication (signing tags) it uses GPG more or less off the shelf. In that case the SHA1 is a reference to a commit object, and you&#x27;re saying that &quot;I, Najaf Ali, sign off on the commit with this SHA1&quot;. It doesn&#x27;t guarantee anything about the <i>contents</i> of that commit if the repository has been tampered with.<p>> is a project like git a safe/sane thing for a non-cryptographer to design and implement? If so, why do all the warnings in this article not apply?<p>See above on git not making the guarantees that software that &quot;uses cryptographic primitives for useful purposes&quot; tend to make. Since Git makes none of those guarantees, it&#x27;s (I think) a safe/sane thing for a non-cryptographer to design and implement. In practice, what Linus has done has let other off-the-shelf crypto (SSH and GPG) make the required guarantees for him.",1387933553

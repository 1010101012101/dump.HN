If I were unable to listen without paying (as indeed I am for a significant portion of my obscure tastes) I still would not pay. The fact that I still listen to music I like through piracy is a separate issue, IMHO, because of this. Like I say, whenever I find music I like with no industry involvement, I pay for it without giving piracy a second thought.<p>2) No, I'm OK with you taking the car, as long as the original is left where it is. If you can't think of a way to do that with a physical object such as a car, then your original analogy was flawed.<p>Again: If my employer didn't pay me, the time that I had worked for that pay would not be left untouched and marketable - it would be gone, ie, stolen rather than illegally copied.<p>The lack of loss of the original is key in the piracy debate, these analogies are flawed because they don't analogise that key point.<p>Piracy is a loss of potential market share, not a loss of something tangible like a car, or my time.

If you don't want to explain fully why each one is inaccurate, you can just give me the numbers, and I'll do my own further research.<p>1.  New features are rolled out without advance notice and without prior explanation of their privacy implications.<p>2.  The privacy policy changes without advance notice, often towards ensuring less privacy.<p>3.  Features that expose more personal information are frequently enabled by default (opt-out rather than opt-in).<p>4.  With instant personalization, social plugins, and the 'likes' feature, FB has switched to making no distinction between 'public if you look for it' and 'publicly broadcast'.<p>5.  These features also indicate that FB has started tracking users browsing habits across the web.  It's not enough to know everything about a person's social life, FB wants to know as much as it can about their private life, too.<p>6.  FB asks to inspect user's email address books while suing a company that uses the same basic technique to manage FB profiles on the user's behalf.  This is staggeringly hypocritical.<p>7.  That same Friend Finder feature does not explain what gets pulled from your email account, and it does not adequately explain that those email addresses are stored and may be used not only to help that user connect with people who already have FB accounts.  It does not explain that FB treats the information it pulls from email accounts as a shadow social graph.<p>8.  There is no easy way to export user data.<p>9.  The privacy settings are lengthy and confusing, and there's no simple way to restrict everything in one go.  To ensure your privacy, you literally have to wade through page after page, and you have to do so on a relatively frequent basis as new features can undo your work (see #1,2,3).",1273149029

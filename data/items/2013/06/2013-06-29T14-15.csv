5962543,comment,5958894,5958894,1,0,cheald,,,"Two things:<p>First off, having multiple login systems doesn&#x27;t necessarily enable you to honeypot credentials off of people that wouldn&#x27;t otherwise give them. The people using Facebook credentials to try to log into a site with Facebook Connect is probably going to reuse the same username and password when they register for your site. People who don&#x27;t understand security are completely terrible at password reuse discipline.<p>Second, the solution to this requires a collaborative effort from both the auth provider and consumer. If I sign into Facebook and check &quot;This is a public computer&quot;, then Facebook should remember that. Then, Facebook should provide a &quot;finishSession&quot; API call or whatnot, which a site calls when the user logs out. This lets Facebook determine what to do with the user&#x27;s facebook.com cookies - if it&#x27;s a transient session, wipe them. If it&#x27;s a persistent session, don&#x27;t do anything with them. OAuth clients shouldn&#x27;t have to care about the semantics of the Facebook login - just like authentication is delegated, so should management of the user&#x27;s session be delegated.<p>This would preserve user expectations in both cases.",1372517786

(Secret courts indeed!)<p>The US internet industry will be lucky to recover, if indeed it is even possible at this point.<p>No foreign business or government or municipality paying attention will ever trust high-value confidential data to Amazon, Google, Apple, Facebook, or Microsoft ever again.<p>Remember that all of these companies have substantially more customers outside of the US than they do who are US citizens.<p>Even if PRISM/MARINA/MAINWAY are provably dismantled (fat chance), we have demonstrated an innate untrustworthiness at the highest levels of government, from both red and blue. Trust is incredibly easy to destroy, and famously difficult to rebuild.  We&#x27;ve now got video of them lying under oath - what&#x27;s to stop them building another in the future and lying about that one, too?  We (both US and &quot;foreign entities&quot;) would have to be stupid not to expect them to do so, given what we&#x27;ve learned in the last month.<p>In this case, the regeneration of trust simply won&#x27;t happen. We&#x27;ll see tons of national commodity services spring up in dozens of industrialized countries simply because our leaders have destroyed our industry with their reckless, short-sighted, fear-based warmongering.<p>Indeed, Snowden&#x27;s disclosures will be the proximate cause of grave and irreparable damage to US interests, industry, and national security.  The problem though, is that the root cause of this damage is shitty, warmongering, fear-driven leadership that is willing to shred every last semblance of the enduring values of this country to game the fickle court of public opinion, pretending to pursue security but instead ushering in a totalitarian nightmare that had been previously confined only to fiction.<p>We passed from the realm of &quot;incompetence&quot; into &quot;malice&quot; territory some time ago and if you think that&#x27;s exaggeration, I urge you to review the disgraceful treatment of Bradley Manning at the hands of the US military prior to even being granted a trial.<p>Sadly, I am vividly reminded of George C Scott&#x27;s incredible performance as General Turgidson in Kubrick&#x27;s &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot;, explaining excitedly to those assembled in the Pentagon&#x27;s War Room why it&#x27;d simply be best for the USA to launch a nuclear first strike, immediately killing hundreds of millions of people (including dozens of millions in the US)to preserve American values.  The mind reels at the scale of the irresponsibility of these decisions undertaken in our name and on our behalf.  There&#x27;s a damn good reason why they teach the system of fallible humans and interlocking governmental checks and balances to every ten-year-old child in social studies class.<p>(A corollary to these conclusions: the corporate rulers of this country, should they wish to continue existing, must dismantle the Nash equilibrium formed by the MSM/GOP/Democrats, lest continued destructive collusion between the only two currently viable parties in the US completely destroy the nation&#x27;s remaining competitive advantage in the global marketplace.)",1372517515

The programming language is a relevant factor on that score.  A project in a new language may require new staff expertise, a new interpreter, a relatively high number of new dependencies, a relatively high investment in new monitoring systems, etc.<p>That said, I don&#x27;t like the language color bar so far, because I&#x27;m having trouble confidently identifying which color is which language.  For example: the reddish/orangish color space has JavaScript, Ruby, and the various JVM languages.  The appearance of these various reds and oranges frequently shifts due to f.lux and differences between the three monitors I commonly use at work and home.  Maybe I&#x27;ll learn the colors better as I get used to the new repository format, but then maybe I won&#x27;t.<p>In practice, I look first at the project description and the beginning of the README to see how the project describes its own strengths and weaknesses.

This is actually somewhat similar to my favorite bug I encountered while implementing some stack mapping optimizations.<p>The compiler itself was crashing out while compiling a SPEC2000 test case (perlbmk I think?) with an illegal instruction. This was already quite suspect since it was branching to somewhere WAY outside of where the program usually resides, and the compiler was compiled with a compiler that&#x27;s known to be nearly rock solid. I got quite lucky in that I managed to find one level of the stack trace, and it pointed me towards sprintf. Using some awesome tools some coworkers and I had developed over the years, I managed to narrow down the test case to about 5 lines of code that involved long doubles. So I grepped the compiler source code for sprintf, set breakpoints on the ones that I thought would get called, and just kept stepping through them until it finally crashed hard. Then I just reran, and stopped at the final breakpoint and started stepping through the assembly. What I saw happen just blew my mind, the code was just a simple:<p>sprintf(buffer, &quot;fold: %Lf&quot;, result);<p>But what was happening is that the buffer was only 200 characters long, and the long double was roughly 1000 characters long. It was just a buffer overflow, that was so long it ended up overwriting the register save area, and the return address pointer. So the sprintf completed, but when it went to branch back, it loaded some characters instead of the return address. Just hilarious, and good thing I was working on stack mapping and was familiar with the stack layout of this linkage convention.<p>The solution of course was to just use snprintf instead. No sorry, that&#x27;s wrong since that platform doesn&#x27;t have an snprintf (yay mainframes!), and so I had to use %0.6Lg instead of %Lf.<p>Compilers are fun!",1372516753

I'm looking for info on the tech industry in France at the moment and how vibrant it is. I'm currently a site reliability engineer for quite a large internet based company. The thing is my partner and I would like to move to France - she's French. Aside from getting my language skills up to scratch I don't know anything of the tech industry job wise over there. Getting a company transfer is not an option as we have no tech bases over there. My skills involve sysadmin linux/unix, automation etc. Any Francophones could provide some info to help?<p>Many thanks",1365159595

This is why the throttle is key, who controls it, on what basis.  I think this is the exact opposite, I think devaluation of a currency over time allows markets, investment, loans to thrive. If your money is shrinking you have to invest, the market will beat the mattress stash over time always due to this.<p>When you invest you create bigger dollars. Someone paying interest their actual value of their dollar might be .85-.95 where the person collecting 5% interest is collecting 1.05 during that same period simply by investing rather than money sitting at 1.00 doing nothing or shrinking due to devaluation.<p>I sum it up as this, poor people pay interest, rich people collect it.  Without devaluation of currency and if the currency just naturally grows at a rate at or higher than inflation or deflation for too long, why invest then, why take the risk if your money grows without investing? The feudal gold conundrum - the mere fact of people being born makes you richer because they have less and there is limited supply? Supplies have to increase, thus currencies have to be devalued. Devalued currencies lessen risk of investment because if you aren't investing you are holding smaller dollars over time. This fuels products like the 30 year mortgage even more, without this banks wouldn't loan as easy. People don't invest as much in deflation because they are overpaying or buying high, holding onto cash is better during those times, so increasing circulation and spending actually fuel investment due to devaluation. It is all a balance and has and will continue to evolve, it works for the most part with fiat levers to get through turbulence and momentary irrational behavior.",1365157219

In practice, prices fall only very slowly, if at all, due to the way that prices are set in practice: Producers decide how much they want to charge, and they are naturally inclined to charge more rather than less. This might be different in a world where the price tags are made by customers, but we have to work with the world we live in.<p>By the way, this is probably the best argument for tolerating a modest rate of inflation (e.g. 5% or so): For ""the market"" to work well, relative prices need to change to reflect the changing reality of production and consumption. Since the mechanisms of how prices are set allow prices to rise faster than they can fall, it is a good idea for the <i>average</i> price level to be increasing at a modest pace.",1365156831

In modern banking, lending is not constrained by the amount of deposits or reserves that a bank has. The only thing limiting the amount of loans given out are capital requirements, and of course risk/return considerations of the bank.<p>The result is that putting money into a savings account of a bank does cause the bank to increase its lending volume.<p>Rather, the amount of bank lending is determined by how many willing and credit-worthy borrowers approach the bank. This in turn depends much more on the overall state of the economy (e.g., whether households are confident enough in the job situation to take on a mortgage, and whether businesses are confident enough of future demand to expand).<p>Note that saving actually tends to be a <i>drag</i> on those factors, because the first-order effect of increased saving is a reduction of aggregate demand.<p>The reason some economists believe that saving is good at a macroeconomic level is that they believe interest rates will adjust to such an extent that banks will be approached by more willing borrowers. The problem with that notion is that loan demand is not actually all that sensitive to interest rates. Even worse is the fact that (nominal) interest rates cannot drop below zero, and (real) interest rates cannot drop below minus the rate of inflation.

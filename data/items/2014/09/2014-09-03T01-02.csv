And I need to install Gentoo again from scratch</i><p>I have no firsthand experience, but I&#x27;ve heard the same thing other times as well. Is it just a baseless rumor?<p>I wouldn&#x27;t be worried about my data per se (backed up with unison, etc), just the hassle of reinstalling and ultimately wary of electing into that kind of user-hostile design.<p>&quot;Developer mode&quot; is equivalent to rooting your phone - something that most users won&#x27;t do, and that some misguided developers will even think they should discriminate against (I believe some banking apps were recently mentioned here). Even if you go out of your way to do it and suffer the oddities, buying such a device sends an economic signal (to Google and developers) and social signal (to less-clued friends) that the official locked-down experience is desirable.",1409709570

You can&#x27;t expect to be good without practice (sometimes lots of practice).<p>At the beginning it is things like mistaking whipping cream for heavy cream, not knowing what &quot;browned&quot; looks like, or other &quot;rookie&quot; mistakes that basically translate to &quot;not actually following the recipe&quot;.<p>As you get more ambitious, you start to tackle things like baking that require an intuition for how much to knead, how sticky is too sticky, etc.<p>Or you start to try recipes that run many things in parallel. Last time I made chicken sauteed in butter, each step was easy enough, but suddenly they have to be done in parallel and the sauce has to be done before the chicken and the potatoes need to be ready at the same time and everything has to happen fast...

There are a couple of &quot;oddities&quot; for me that perhaps folks will encounter:<p>1.

It appears that with syncdb going away, there isn&#x27;t an option available. I really hope there&#x27;s a way to retain syncdb for unittest because I don&#x27;t need to test database migration every time I run my quick unittests.<p>2. I think &#x27;makemigrations&#x27; is a bit inconsistent at the moment. Sometimes it creates more than 1 initial files, sometimes it creates just 1 (if you run &#x27;makemigrations app-name&#x27; instead of &#x27;makemigrations&#x27;)<p>There are a couple of other general Django issues, but those are the things I encountered while working with 1.7.x.",1409709133

Else \nif f and g are different, then, even if\nthe data they observe is the same, they\nmight\nget different estimates.  Even if f = g,\nsince each of Alice and Bob is\nflipping the coin for themselves, \nthey need not get the same estimate for p.<p>Note:  Since f is Borel measurable, we can\nset real random variable Z = f(X_1, X_2, X_3) and\nask for E[Z], etc.  Sometimes this step is useful.\nThat is, our estimator of p is also a random variable.<p>We might like to have E[Z] = p; in this case, Z is\nan &#x27;unbiased&#x27; estimator of p.<p>Also we can ask for the variance of Z, say, Var(Z), and\nmaybe we want Var(Z) to be small.  If we can show\nthat Var(Z) is the smallest among all\nBorel measurable f, then the choice Alice made\nfor f is a &#x27;minimum variance&#x27; estimator.<p>If Alice gets charged money for being wrong, then\nwe can try to minimize the expected value of\nwhat Alice gets charged, and here we have\na case of &#x27;statistical decision theory&#x27;.<p>Since order statistics are always sufficient,\nwith the assumptions we have, Alice need\nonly be told 2 zeros and 1 1 and can\nf&#x27;get about the rest.<p>I see no surprises or difficulties here.<p>But the sample space Omega is the same for\nboth Alice and Bob.  And, for both Alice\nand Bob, there is only one\ntrial, that is, only one point little omega,\nin Omega involved.  That is, in more detail, \nX_1 is a function, the function\nX_1:  Omega --> R, and in our case for\nour trial little omega we have\nX_1(little omega) = 0.  That is, usually in\nthe notation we suppress little omega.  Alice\nand Bob are both using the same trial little omega\nand the same sigma algebra script F on the same\nsample space Omega.<p>We have no reason to believe that random variables\nX_1:  Omega --> R and Y_1:  Omega --> R are equal.\nThus, given a Borel subset K of R, the events\nX_1^{-1}(K) in the sigma algebra script F on Omega \nand Y_1^{-1}(K) also in the sigma algebra script\nF on Omega need not be the same.<p>That&#x27;s a little of how applied probability\nbased on &#x27;modern probability&#x27; works.<p>I see no problems and no need to consider\nfrequentism or Bayesianism.<p>Questions?",1409708921

Prior to the CCD, astronomers used photographic plates to take their images, and photographic plates have horrendous efficiencies.  A typical photographic plate will only register a few percent of the incident photons.  A CCD, however, has an efficiency very close to 100% (except at really low wavelengths).  Almost immediately after its invention, new instruments with CCDs were built to be put on existing telescopes. [1]  Because the efficiency was a factor of ~30 larger, it was as though you had quintupled the diameter of your telescope.  There wasn&#x27;t much of a reason, then, to invest in huge new telescopes when you could effectively have a huge new telescope just by building a CCD detector.<p>Also, as a graduate student at Ohio State I would be remiss if I neglected to mention that the Large Binocular Telescope was originally planned to be built at the same time as Keck.  It was originally conceived to be larger and with OSU providing a large fraction of the funding.  OSU&#x27;s president, Gordon Gee, cut funding for the project in the early 90&#x27;s, however, which threw the project into disarray.  Most of the faculty in the Ohio State astronomy department resigned in protest which is why Ohio State has had a department with relatively young faculty.  Due to problems funding the project and technical difficulties (putting two very large mirrors on a common mount turned out to be harder than anticipated), the telescope had to be scaled back and it only saw first light in 2005.<p>[1] As an aside, astronomy has been one of the major drivers of improvements in CCD technology.  CCDs in consumer devices are generally used in photon-rich environments and the users can tolerate a lot of noise in their images.  Astronomers, however, demand very low noise and use their CCDs in photon-poor environments, and the production of these kinds of devices has required major improvements in CCD technology.",1409708429

I did the screen upgrade[0] and was extremly happy with the mod. Unfortunatley a mishap at a hackerspace involving a large cup of beer destroyed my poor motherboard. I had a descision to make: either buy a new laptop or repair this one. I went with the rebuild plan. I squeezed in an x201 motherboard into the chassis instead of going with the same C2D mobo. I bought a refurbed 120GB SSD and a new 4GB stick of RAM. On top of that I had to replace my keyboard so that came as I also bought a new 9-Cell battery.<p>In the end I ended up with a near new x201 with an x200 chassis, an IPS screen, SSD, full DIMM of RAM, and a kew keyboard with roughly 8-9 hours of battery life all for about $550 out of pocket. I&#x27;ve spent about 2 years with it like this and if I had to make the choice again I would absolutley do the repair; I love my laptop.

It&#x27;s worth noting that even when you switch to EMV, there is about a 5-year conversion period where vendors have to support older non-EMV cards. This is assuming all banks switch to EMV. Canada only has about 5 major banks and they all did it quickly but only recently are swipe-cards losing support.<p>Since it will take a while to be 100% chip-and-pin from both investment by banks and adoption by consumers, USA can look forward to debit and credit card breaches for a long time. So they&#x27;ll have to invest heavily in information security, not just EMV.",1409706781

It took a bit of upfront time investment to migrate all my existing accounts into the tool but once that was done, it&#x27;s been a pretty seamless experience overall.<p>There&#x27;s browser add-ons you can use to auto-populate your login details that work well for most login forms with mostly no or minimal configuration required. It can get a little annoying when the login form has a CAPTCHA or some other non-standard requirement, but generally all that means is a few extra clicks. When creating new account details, configurable (e.g. length, allowed characters, etc.) password generation is built in.<p>You can keep your encrypted data store file on a cloud service for syncing between devices, should you wish. Which brings me to the 1Password mobile apps, which allow you to take your details mobile.<p>Probably the greatest friction point I&#x27;ve encountered has been when I&#x27;m on a foreign computer that doesn&#x27;t have any of my 1Password support tools installed on it.

Over a short scale, say 1980-2010, interest rates have gone from 20% to practically zero.  So Joe 6 Pack who is going to pay $1500 no matter what interest rate exists, has caused the previous owners selling price to explode.  And once prices start exploding, the bubbly pile on begins.<p>Its also a fad.  Post 1950 no $ should be spared on education.  Post 1990-ish no $ should be spared on real estate.

The point is, why own a car that you have to maintain, depreciates, and requires parking when you can have brand new, well-maintained vehicles transporting you around for a small monthly fee?<p>Your Bill Gates analogy only seals my argument. Bill Gates, in all liklihood, has a personal driver and rides in a top of the line vehicle most of the time, that he may or may not own. (He likely doesn&#x27;t care.) The reason this lifestyle is only available to the rich is not because of the cost of the car, but because of the cost of the driver.

Likewise, looking up a solution to a problem isn&#x27;t going to teach you how to solve that problem.  You may think you learn the solution, but the only way you really learn it is to figure it out yourself.  Try solving some problems and writing some programs while limiting yourself to only looking up specific questions. Questions about language syntax, or what functions are offered to do a certain task.  This is easier accomplished when trying to break your Google addiction if you sit and think about the problem first. Sketch out your idea and maybe put down some basic pseudo code. After you think your model is fairly complete, start coding it. As you code it only look up documentation (such as JavaDoc) to find how to do what you outlined in your pseudo code.  As you program it you will likely think of better ways to do things.  Try to finish without looking up and solutions online, then review your code and debug it.  Make sure your code works the way you expected it to and is as good as you can think of making it.  Then, and only then, look up what a good, correct solution to the problem is.  Now when you see the solution you will make connections to your code and how you can optimize it.  Things will make more sense, start to fall into place, and you&#x27;ll learn a lot more if you take this approach.  It will be more frustrating at first, but in the end it will feel far more rewarding because you actually understand it.",1373320427

SF is one of my favorite cities in the world, but there are a LOT of downsides to it. I find that a lot of the people I know who live there adopt a borderline Stockholm Syndrome attitude about those downsides.<p>If you live in SF, you have easy access to all sorts of great things, but the downside is that unless you are fabulously wealthy, you are most likely renting an old and not necessarily well-maintained apartment with one (or two or three or more...) roommates, in a neighborhood with a disturbing number of homeless people and/or occasional violent crime, and you have to take the bus (or ride a bike) everywhere you go because it&#x27;s just too much of an expensive hassle to drive anywhere. I&#x27;m not describing the living standards for college students or blue collar people, these are living standards for people who are probably in the top 5% income bracket in the entire country.<p>Those same people will tell you stuff like, why would you want to own a home? Why would you want to live by yourself? What do you have against homeless people? Why would you want a car in the first place? What&#x27;s wrong with you, you barbarian!<p>There&#x27;s something to be said for those perspectives, and I appreciate the value of living in a really dense and culturally rich city with great public transportation. But so many of the SF residents that I know go way beyond looking on the bright side, to the point of fetishizing the very things that can make SF an unpleasant place to live.<p>Maybe if I lived there I&#x27;d be like that too. It&#x27;s natural to always want to look on the bright side of whatever your living situation is, it&#x27;s just annoying when people get super militant about it, to the point of accusing you of being a bad or stupid person if you don&#x27;t want to live there too.",1373320375

I see plenty of ideas, and wouldn&#x27;t call all of them obvious.<p>I also think there is at the very least a core of truth in it. For example, that 30% time gain in not looking for a parking spot. If people now want to spend an hour on travelling and gain 10 minutes that way, it isn&#x27;t strange to assume that they will be willing to move 10 minutes driving farther into the suburbs (cheaper house, larger garden, etc).<p>So, I expect traffic to increase. An extra reason for that to happen is that time currently spent operating your car could be spent in other ways. For example, you could watch a full-length movie/do some yoga on your way to work every day. For a movie/yoga enthusiast, that could make the 1.5 hour trip preferable over the 1 hour one, especially since it will come with the cheaper/better housing.<p><i>&quot;the downstream effects are hard to predict but undoubtedly will follow the same path all automation has: more efficient, less polluting&quot;</i><p>You mean as in &quot;living in a suburb and driving a SUV to work is less polluting than living in the center of town and driving a bicycle or walking to work?&quot;",1373319254

I doubt that&#x27;s all you&#x27;ll get in Austin. A lot of New York/Bay Area people are moving to Austin, Seattle and NC to raise families and most of them have aged out of their heavy-drinking days.<p>Nor do you (should you, anyway) want the people who work 75-hour weeks at their startups and don&#x27;t learn any new skills except the one or two things in the critical path of their assigned project (the rest of their work being grunt work they learn nothing from). Those people will suffer a lot to keep their jobs and because they overestimate the career benefit of what they&#x27;re doing, but they rarely produce anything good.<p>So you don&#x27;t want the Austin stereotype (leaves at 5:00, drinking by 5:30) or the Bay Area/New York stereotype (all-in on his employer&#x27;s assigned work, burns out in 15 months, gets fired but walks away with a tiny sliver of equity that prevents you from forgetting his existence entirely). I agree with you on both. (Not to say that those stereotypes describe everyone in those regions; they don&#x27;t.)<p>You want the people who leave at 5:00pm and then work on things that interest them for 3 hours. (Or get up early and work on side projects before coming to you.) Those are the people with the good ideas. Not the workaholic corporate stooges, and not the semi-retired slackers.<p>Also, there&#x27;s absolutely nothing wrong with working an 8-hour day if you do it efficiently. Hell, an efficient 5-hour day is probably better than what most corporates put in, even if they&#x27;re in the office for 10+ hours (that&#x27;s about shared suffering and its social purposes, not efficiency).",1373318369

6009263,comment,6008485,6009184,2,0,ufo,,,"Absolutely correct, I ommited error handling to keeop the example simple but error handling is definitely more natural in a promise setting because you don&#x27;t need to make your own error callback protocol.<p>That said, I still feel that both promises and explicit callbacks kind of suck in their own way. Callback code is usually much more verbose and has bad error handling while promises are bad at &quot;jumpy&quot; control flow. When I last worked in a big JS project it got bad enough that I eventually wrote my own control flow library on top of the base Dojo promises we were using so nowadays if I had to work with a big JS project again I would <i>definitely</i> try to use of those tools that add async control flow to the language and compile doen to regular continuations (looks nice like promises, can use loops, break and return like regular JS and raw callbacks don&#x27;t need extra runtime support)",1373317254

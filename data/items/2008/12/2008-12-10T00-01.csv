In fact, CouchDB et al. <i>store</i> data like we do in the real world but they certainly do not represent data as it is in the real world. That crown goes to RDBMSs. Suppose we have two physical records of a company's logo. Then the company logo changes but only one of the records is updated. That kind of error took place because the physical storage model (two places) did not correspond to the data model (one entity). That is where RDBMSs shine and CouchDB fails. RDBMSs allow data relations to be expressed and then have the DB enforce these relations. This incurrs some overhead (and I suspect, makes most web programmers think that RDBMSs are ""old school"") but in most cases, this overhead is paid for several times over in future data integrity.",1228869879

While one can argue that some unions are quite predatory in expanding their membership, just the fact that a workplace <i>becomes</i> unionized says a lot about the failings of management.<p>The flip side is that unions tend to overstay their need. Once the union forms and gets what it wants, it tends to stick around and start looking for other things to campaign for. I would consider joining a union in order to address a specific grievance, but I don't think they should be permanent institutions. Once they accomplish their goal, they should automatically disband.<p>Making them permanent allows them to respond more quickly, but it also makes them vehicles for those seeking power, which means they usually overreach.",1228867416

It's not some abstract little academic and mathematical simulation of ""efficiency"". When businesses screw up, people suffer.

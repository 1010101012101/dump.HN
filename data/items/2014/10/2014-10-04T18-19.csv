8410229,comment,8406764,8409496,1,0,merijnv,,,"The reason GHC allocates at such an aggressive rate is the fact that memory allocation is <i>really</i> cheap in GHC. Allocating memory on the GHC heap is literally just bumping the &quot;top of heap ptr&quot;, so writing one word.<p>The idea is that 90% of allocations are very short-lived, so allocating a ton doesn&#x27;t matter as long as you can throw it away cheaply. Suppose we have an inner loop over an array, summing values. We may allocate at 1.6 GB/s doing the computation, but everything <i>except</i> the last value is garbage.<p>When we GC we simply copy this last value from the current heap and reset the &quot;top of heap pointer&quot;. Yet another cheap operation.<p>There&#x27;s a lot more going on (generational GC, nursery&#x27;s and what not), but GHC&#x27;s GC heavily abuse some facts that, for example, CRuby cannot, such as the fact that older generations can <i>never</i> reference data in newer generations, so GCing the current generation never has to perform &quot;major GC&quot; (i.e. checking the older data whether it still needs the current generation).",1412449165

To me people are aware of themselves, but society is not aware of itself. People are truly alone in their own life, society is not really there to really help them or make them connect with each other properly. This way, society is unable to really improve itself by improving its subjects. That&#x27;s why I try to compare society as a live being, holding several cells.<p>This helped me contextualize myself in society, and give context to what society really is. Also important to never look down to anybody or anything, always be curious and not leave a thought with pessimism, always try to understand the compromises and origins of things. It&#x27;s not an ode to optimism and positivism, but always be sure to confront your interests as a human in the void of the universe, and understand that even if it looks pointless, if it&#x27;s a step forward, it&#x27;s a good step.<p>I&#x27;m also very bad at expressing myself.",1412449070

8410172,comment,8409783,8409783,1,0,bobbyhotpockets,,,"I feel like bitcoin supporters, in talking about things like the convenience and simplicity of transactions, while not incorrect, are missing the critical issues that are going to determine bitcoin&#x27;s fate.<p>If we look at bitcoin vs. US banknotes, a paypal balance, a pile of gold bars in a bunker, whatever, if we&#x27;re looking at how bitcoin performs vs. all these things at the moment in time when we&#x27;re transferring them to someone else, bitcoin is superior in every case.  The problem is this window is brief.  Non-transactional moments in the life of bitcoin is where the problem lies.<p>Looking at historic pricing of bitcoin, and seeing a peak at a little over $1k, what does the future price need to be for people to feel comfortable receiving bitcoins and just holding onto and forgetting about them, in the same way they could with, say, 100 bucks in their wallet?  Being divisible down to 8 decimal places might rationally address the issue of how to spend something where the base unit costs as much as an Xbox.  But even if bitcoin could somehow split at something like 300 or 500:1, to make a bitcoin roughly equal to a US dollar or a Euro, does that really solve the problem of perception?  The historical chart, with the accelerated volume and insane swings in both directions, might never recede from the mind of the public.<p>I just have a hard time understanding what a path to acceptance as a legitimate currency looks like.  Years of price stability would be a great start.  But the beginning of that period hasn&#x27;t even begun.  In the past month alone, the price has moved by 30%, and daily volatility regularly sees the price change by 5%.  I can sort of squint my eyes and imagine scenarios where bitcoin, the currency, wins.  What I can&#x27;t see is how bitcoin, the speculative investment, also does well.  That these two things are at odds leads to other issues, too, but this is already unnecessarily long.",1412448212

Their system was a replicated database running directly on the hard disk, with no file system.<p>There&#x27;s something to be said for this. Your files get ACID properties. If we were serious about file integrity, we&#x27;d have file systems that worked like this:<p>- Unit files. The unit of data is the entire file. Files are written once, and when closed successfully, the file transaction commits and others can read the file.  Any update replaces the entire file as an atomic operation.  (Many applications need this, and try to do it with various move and rename operations, usually leaving files behind if things fail at the wrong moment.)<p>- Log files.  You can only add at the end. Writes are atomic. In the event of a crash, the file is valid up to some recently completed write. (On many systems, log files can tail off into junk or contain truncated records.)<p>- Temporary files. When the process or process group exits, they&#x27;re gone. Random access is OK. (You shouldn&#x27;t have to clean up junk temporary files.)<p>- Managed files.  These support a database or something with complex structure. There are extra I/O functions for locking, flushing and being sure a write has been committed to disk.<p>That covers most of the use cases for files.  There have been file systems which did some of this, but not in recent years.",1412448137

Thus, as a protection against fire, if we cannot use nonflammable materials, insulation (passive) is usually better than water spray turned on automatically (active), but that is usually better than water spray turned on by people (procedural).

GWT 3.0 introduces a new interop system that can take WebIDL, @JsDoc, or TypeScript annotations as descriptive of the interface of the underlying Javascript and synthesize Java interfaces that match the API. The compiler can generate code to call into Javascript with zero wrappers, maximizing performance and code size. It can even sub-class native Javascript objects (class Foo extends Bar.Prototype) using only standard Java syntax.<p>For example, using similar techniques that html5index.org uses, all browser native APIs are automatically covered by fetching the latest WebIDL definitions from Chromium or Firefox&#x27;s repository or via standards docs, and used to generate the interfaces.<p>Or, using IDE FileWatchers, we use the Closure Compiler to read in Javascript libraries and/or externs, infer types, and write out interfaces. Likewise, we&#x27;ll be able to read in typescript library interfaces and generate Java interfaces.<p>Combining the new JsInterop system, Java8, and SuperDevMode&#x27;s <1 second compiles, the new system eliminates wrappers, reduces Java boilerplate overhead (lambdas, method references), and provides fast refresh times.",1412446721

8410058,comment,8409823,8409823,1,0,graycat,,,"So the title starts &quot;The books ...&quot;, and reading the\narticle shows that by <i>books</i> they mean just\nfictional novels. but, the books we talk about on HN\nhave included:<p>Knuth, <i>The Art of Computer Programming</i>.<p>Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L.\nRivest, and Clifford Stein, <i>Introduction to\nAlgorithms</i>.<p>Jeffrey D. Ullman, <i>Principles of Database Systems</i>.<p>Jacques Neveu, <i>Mathematical Foundations of the\nCalculus of Probability</i>.<p>David G. Luenberger, <i>Optimization by Vector Space\nMethods</i>.<p>Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie, <i>The C\nProgramming Language</i>.<p>Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne, <i>Algorithms</i>.<p>Sorry, <i>NYR</i>, my house, nearly every room, is awash\nin books in mathematics, science, engineering,\nmusic, none of which would be of interest to the\n<i>NYR</i>, and a few others but likely less than 2% are\nfictional novels.<p>So, the claim of the title &quot;the books we talk about&quot;\nappears not to apply very well to HN and the same or\nmuch less so to me.  That is, the title is\npresumptive.<p>Why do I say this?  Maybe not everyone at HN will\nagree with me, but in grades 1-12 and the first two\nyears of college, I felt force fed like a Strasbourg\ngoose with books that were fiction.  It wasn&#x27;t until\nthe last two years of college that I got to\nconcentrate on what I really cared about,\n<i>non-fiction</i>, that is, science, mathematics,\nengineering, etc.<p>So I remain torqued:  For years and years I was\nforce fed with I didn&#x27;t want and largely blocked\nfrom what I did want.<p>And, now that I have more understanding of\n<i>fiction</i>, I have to conclude, with this force\nfeeding and blocking, some of my best years for\nlearning were seriously wasted.  Thus, I&#x27;m torqued.<p>I have to be reminded of C. P. Snow, <i>The Two\nCultures</i> and find, (with irony) with that favorite\nword of the literary set, irony, a post in the\nculture of engineering, math, and science by the\nculture of fictional novels, <i>belle lettre</i>,\nliterary art, etc.",1412445924

8410050,comment,8409020,8409020,1,0,morgante,,,"First off, I think you should probably ignore a <i>lot</i> of the advice in this thread. They&#x27;re tossing US rates at you which are basically irrelevant.<p>There&#x27;s simply no way anyone will pay $100/hr to someone in the Philippines.<p>That being said, your goal of $15-20/hr is completely doable from the start. Just go on odesk.com or elance.com and start bidding on projects. Start at $15/hr and then gradually increase your rate as you develop a great reputation.<p>If you&#x27;d like to increase your rate substantially (never to US levels, but maybe to $50-60/hr), make 3 investments:<p>1) Take English classes. Communication skills are absolutely essential for freelance/remote work, and I&#x27;d much rather pay $20-30/hr more to someone whose sentences parse readily for me.<p>2) Learn other languages and some CS fundamentals. Someone who basically just learned Ruby out of 1 book and worked at a mediocre company is never going to be considered at the top of the heap, so do what you can to move up the value chain.<p>3) Start to build a technical brand/portfolio. If you contribute to some open source projects, that&#x27;s where you can really start to see higher rates (if you wrote/contributed to an open source project I&#x27;m using, I&#x27;d happily pay you $150/hr to make some changes).",1412445867

That can be a source of encouragement to take on a project that&#x27;s a bigger than your previous one.",1412445850

8410045,comment,8409823,8409968,1,0,ChuckMcM,,,"This is also an issue for me. The answer is a book group if you can find like minded individuals, or people willing to read. Too many people just don&#x27;t read anything any more so the possibility of just &#x27;running into someone at a party&#x27; who does read has been greatly reduced. It might make for an interesting meetup at a maker space I suspect.",1412445742
8410044,comment,8406358,8409637,1,0,cell303,,,"Actually, I think they can (also be entrepreneurs and artists) They just can&#x27;t all be successful ones. However, due to the non-linearity of success, the winners would offset the losers, which is also why incubators like y combinator can make a profit.<p>So what it boils down to really is a social issue, where you have to find a way to ensure a fair treatment of the losers. Theoretically they were just as likely to be huge successes (I think this is especially true for artists) as those who actually turned out to be. If that wasn&#x27;t true one could easily run a successful incubator on their own.<p>However, culturally, the idea of compensating the losers seems alien (and even outrageous in some places) as we used to live in a economy with a much more linear relationship between effort and return. I guess this is why ideas like &#x27;basic income&#x27; have such a hard time being even discussed, although they would address the issue, maybe even solve it.",1412445722

I've been following Windows Phone 7 as of late and it seems that they've made it easy to program for the platform by offering development tools, samples, and instruction.  There is scant documentation or examples for Enyo.<p>They changed app dev frameworks on all of their existing developers from Mojo to Enyo.  That can't help either.  I think they have a near Herculean task in trying to claw back market share.  There seem to be a few evangelists who love the webOS platform and its devices but when it comes to consumers paying at the door that is in jeopardy.",1307653093

Which is a joke, because one of them often eats with a knife and fork. How much coding is he really getting done while doing that?<p>But we do have the noise of the utensils and the glass dishes to enjoy, along with the smell of the food and the other noises which tend to accompany eating.<p>So for all of you out there, eating at your desks at work.

""Correct, it doesn't do as much as an iPad, but it's also not as expensive.""<p>This notion that ""the market says $499 price points are what tablets should be priced at"" is stupid.  $499 is what <i>iPads</i> will sell at - no one else has yet demonstrated that a $499 is viable for any other tablet than the iPad.  I will say it's foolish to keep trying this late in the game.  If a company as big as HP isn't willing to do what it takes to get these in to peoples' hands (which may include selling below cost), there's little hope this will be a viable competitor.",1307651502

No kool-aid drinking here.<p>Accenture is a culture you either fit into or you don't - a very 'up-or-out' mentality.<p>Some of the problems that commenters have noted are definitely attributed to the internal culture: an over-emphasis on face-time, long hours with no real work to do, and occasionally selling work that was undeliverable (technically unfeasible, impossible delivery schedule, etc).<p>Some management was good, a lot of it was poor, and generally the focus was on selling and looking good rather than delivering a viable product.   At all levels, you're ranked against your co-workers for a very small number of promotion slots, particularly in recent times.  This creates a strange dynamic: you're both trying to work with people at your level to create something useful for a client and prove that you're better/smarter/faster than your peers, some of whom are on the same project and most of whom you've never met.<p>Many of the complaints, however, are an effect of having large numbers of stakeholders on a complicated project.  Clients are often unpredictable, and incented by a completely different set of goals.  There's generally a lot of money and a lot of management involved, and people have their careers staked on these projects - disagreement is normal.  Rework was extremely common due to constant spec changes, and I had to go to bat for my developers numerous times.<p>It's not a great work environment.  Low and mid level people are generally dropped into a project with no background and the client has been told that they're experts on whatever giant, 30-year-old legacy system that the client is running.  They fake it and learn on the job.  There's often a hostile reception from the client employees - the perception is that you're a highly paid consultant coming to take their job or fire them.  Travel is the norm, and you're expected to work long hours since you aren't going home to a family - just a generic hotel room.<p>Ultimately, what drove me out was the lack of interesting and rewarding work, the internal politics, and the isolation.

The problem I was trying to solve is, basically, why is it then that scientists don't make a lot of money (a small fact, which, I believe, causes a ""brain drain"" to the financial industry, etc).

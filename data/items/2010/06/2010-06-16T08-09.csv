1435062,comment,1434825,1434994,0,0,dieterrams,,,"> You say that peripheral vision is more impairing than lack of binocular disparity. But peripheral vision has zero impact on depth perception<p>Ah, but he didn't say ""more impairing <i>with respect to depth perception</i>."" He was talking about impairment in general. As in, the loss of peripheral vision that comes with having only one eye is probably a bigger deal than the loss of binocular depth perception that comes with having only one eye, because binocular depth perception doesn't confer that much of a perceptual advantage over the ability to process motion parallax.<p>That last part is certainly debatable, and really depends on the context. Your tennis example brings to mind the fact that binocular depth perception is really helpful for hunters (of many species), presumably because it gives them more precise depth information with less orthogonal movement. Wider peripheral vision is probably better for avoiding predators and other dangers. (I was just reading about animals with binocular 360 degree vision, after wondering why 360 degree vision wasn't more prevalent.)<p>For a modern human, which sort of visual impairment is more impairing likely depends a lot on lifestyle and environment.",1276678421

It looked like a BlackBerry or Windows Mobile phone — hardware keyboards and non-touch screens. ... What’s goofy is the idea that Google would do this — to aggressively change Android from a BlackBerry/Windows Mobile competitor into an iPhone competitor...</i><p>He's dividing phones into two categories here: BlackBerry/Windows Mobile-like phones and iPhone-like phones. This is a very questionable standpoint. It's like dividing tablets into Windows-like tablets and iPad-like tablets, and claiming that they're two separate markets.<p>On the contrary, tech hardware is constantly evolving. What's possible in 2010 wasn't possible in 2005, and what was possible in 2005 wasn't possible in 1995. In the past, it made sense to go with the benefits of a physical keyboard at the expense of screen real estate. Today, phones are extremely powerful, their screens run at high resolutions, carriers are more liberal, and mobile app developers abound. Google isn't switching markets to suddenly start competing with the iPhone; they're just keeping up with the times. Saying that Google should have ""kept Android targeted at BlackBerry"" is like saying the US should have focused on producing spears and arrows during the nuclear arms race.",1276678391

1435040,comment,1434056,1434056,0,0,daveungerer,,,"""... and had him take a look at some of my UML diagrams.""<p>OK, so you give yourself only a month to launch a web-based startup and you spent some time... creating UML diagrams?  I'm trying really hard not to be snarky here, but that immediately disqualifies you from writing blog posts about startup myths.<p>It sounds like you took the development process from your day job and applied it to your startup.  But you're forgetting that these processes were designed to facilitate communication between larger teams.  Which means you've given up one of the most important advantages of a smaller (even single-person) team.<p>Also, your version of a single-person startup is a straw man.  No-one ever said being a single founder means breaking contact with the rest of the world.<p>As a single founder, here's my humble advice:<p>- You learnt a lot in this month.  You'll learn new lessons on your next startup, whether you fail or not.  Take some time to process it all while you think of your next startup.  Maybe read some PG essays (Read them critically, the same way you'd read anything else.  I'm trying not to sound like a fanboy, but his essays do have a high insight to noise ratio).<p>- Don't for one second deceive yourself into thinking a month of full-time work is enough.  Even if you could complete all the coding in a month, things like SEO and just generally getting traction take much more patience.  You said: ""...get the first core part of my service in working order, and profit"".  Know that the road between a working service and profit is very long.<p>- If you need a Chief Architect or a DBA to evaluate your technical design decisions, you're probably not ready to be a single founder.  Try to get more design experience in your job, or team up with someone who has complementary skills for your next startup.  As a single founder, time spent talking to people means mostly talking to customers, not other technical people.<p>- Your article seems to be pretty focused on just development, I guess because you never even got to beta.  You'll have an entirely new perspective on things once you launch a service and come to the shocking realisation that customers don't magically appear.  Most startups don't fail for lack of technology.<p>- Have you given up on your idea now, before even giving it a chance to prove itself in the market?  Then you had the wrong idea.  An idea you really believe in is one you'll only give up on after serious repeated attempts to get customers deliver no results.",1276677598
1435039,comment,1434944,1434944,0,0,lionhearted,,,"I like John Gruber, and I upvoted this article, but this point:<p>> Look at those 2007 Android designs compared to the original 2007 iPhone. Now compare a 2010 Android design to a current iPhone. Don’t tell me Google’s mobile strategy hasn’t changed.<p>I mean, he's totally right. It did change. But it wasn't to knock off Apple, it's because Google is building what consumers want and demand now.<p>Apple can say, ""We pioneered that!"" That's true. But they can't say, ""We pioneered that - how dare they!"" Because that's misplaced. Consumer preference has shifted, and yes, that's due in large part because of Apple's actions.<p>But Apple gets into trouble when they start thinking, ""People want iPhones and these jerks are copying our iPhone"" - because consumers don't necessarily want iPhones. They want well-designed devices which are fun and intuitive to use. Apple helped reveal that path, but they don't exactly get to plant a flag in the ground and say that's theirs now, forever, and how dare anyone else build well-designed devices with intuitive touchscreen interfaces.<p>Any other company I'd shrug at the misplaced righteous indignation, but Apple <i>really</i> should know better, since they got into this with Microsoft over ""look and feel"" last decade over GUI. The reaction was the same, ""How dare Microsoft try to give people Apple-like stuff!"" But that's wrong. Microsoft gave people what they wanted, which was pretty and and more intuitive navigation.<p>It's like - when you introduce a new general standard, you can't really own it. It's out there. You get a massive head start, but then people will start using that standard and innovating on it. Traditionally what companies with the head start do is cut prices to lock in market share and make it impossible for people to compete, but Apple runs on crazy margins, so they refuse to do this, get angry at whoever is making something that fills similar needs for a lower price than them, and then lose their market. And now they're doing it again.",1276677592

Inefficient spacing/sizing requiring more scrolling and mousing to use. Nonstandard 'check' indicator which is farther from its label than usual on-the-left practice. Large floating fixed footer not seeming to provide value commensurate with its placement. 'About' slide-out that's impossible for me to close without major window fussing (maximize window, close row of open tabs).<p>Feature request: provide checklist items as plain text.",1276675211

8837160,comment,8832110,8832110,0,0,akulesa,,,"Original author here - I just discovered this thread. Thanks so much for all the comments!<p>Some context behind why I wrote this post: as a researcher and technologist in biology, I&#x27;ve realized that it&#x27;s unclear to me what the real questions are; that this lack of clarity is not due to my immaturity; and the field seems dangerously aimless.<p>>99% of the time, work is justified (and finished) with some application to health and medicine, with little regard for theory building or true understanding of a system. Bringing up this point usually solicits two responses: 1) we don&#x27;t have enough data yet 2) there&#x27;s little use for theory in biology.  I hope I can give more in depth responses where I see these themes in other comments, but I&#x27;ll generalize my thoughts here.<p>First, how do we judge what questions are worth asking and researching, vs trivial details? How do we even know whether we understand whether a question has been adequately answered? The current state of research to me often seems like John Searle&#x27;s Chinese Room: we just generate a huge dictionary of perturbation-responses and call this &quot;understanding&quot;. This might be effective to find drug targets, but is it real understanding? It might be the first step, but it seems to me that we&#x27;re swimming in plenty of data already and it&#x27;s worth it to step back and try to figure out what what it is we are actually trying to do. I&#x27;m comfortable with the fact that answers to our questions might be a long ways off, but it&#x27;s scary that no one seems to care that we don&#x27;t even know what the questions are.<p>Second, I&#x27;d argue biology has historically been very theoretical. We developed a whole quantitative theory of genetics (Fisher, Wright, Haldane, ...) before we had identified what a gene actually was. Hell, it was still debated what matter even looked like at that the microscale (where we knew genes must exist)! In the advent of molecular biology, Watson, Crick, Brenner, Gamow, Delbruck, et al, predicted through (some) experiments but mostly reasoning and conjecture much of what was later found to be true about transcription/translation. There are countless other examples of where theory has driven the study of the origin of life, molecular biology, ecology, et cetera. Only recently, when health science started to dominate biological research, did biology become less theoretical and more focused on individual instances of problems.<p>tl;dr - What&#x27;s most scary is that we don&#x27;t even know what the foundational questions are anymore for modern biology, and no one seems to even care. Rather than focusing on clearly stated foundations, the field is guided by the latest trends in glamour journals, which tend to obfuscate questions rather than answer them.",1420430228

So, if we accept the premise that all the OSes were equally buggy and it also took Tiger 6 months to get the bugs worked out, then you still had another <i>18 months of a stable OS</i>.<p>This reasonably allows customers to decide whether to be early adopters or waiters: its perfectly fine to hold off those 6 initial months since you then still get 3/4 of the products lifespan with some assurance that its stable. That&#x27;s just not the case anymore, if you wait those 6 months then now you&#x27;ve got another release right around the corner, you&#x27;re perpetually in upgrade mode. Not to mention that most the bugs will probably ship in the major release anyways since (non-security) bug fix release have more or less merged with the new features that introduce new bugs release.",1420430203

I have been working on a solution for RiftSketch that is more like Robert&#x27;s approach, where I use a canvas backed by an actual textarea (Robert&#x27;s canvas is cleverly backed by an Ace Editor instance). Instead of re-implementing an editor from scratch, the user keyboard inputs are received by the textarea while the canvas and corresponding 3D texture are simply a re-rendered mirror of the textarea&#x27;s contents and cursor/selection state.

Just because people are paranoid about new releases being crap, <i>it doesn&#x27;t mean that they are not crap</i>.<p>Personally, I&#x27;ve experienced a number of really bad bugs in Yosemite. One of the most annoying is four-finger swipes to bring up launchpad: the &quot;blur&quot; animation starts and then just hangs midway, leaving a half-transparent launchpad that works with keyboard controls but not mouse-clicks. Or the infamous &quot;backbreak&quot;, where you do two-finger swipes to go back in a browser window and somehow it fails mid-way, leaving an unusable browser page and breaking <i>all</i> two-finger gestures until you close that window (not tab, the whole window).

Doesn&#x27;t make it false either.<p>For starters, a lot of modern &quot;science&quot; is hastily written papers for research grants or keeping the researcher up there, the majority of which doesn&#x27;t even hold in a second examination (this was shown in several meta-reviews, including in biology/medicine, e.g.: <a href=""http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pmed.0020124"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fj...</a> ).<p>I&#x27;m not for reductionism when it comes to complex emergent phenomena like our sense of self and feelings.

Those who&#x27;ve followed 19th and 20th century medicine have seen so many bullshit fads and theories that were debunked later. Even being gay was a medical issue, not many decades ago. No reason to believe &quot;it&#x27;s really different this time&quot;.<p>Some people treat science like some neutral agent -- as if interests, stupidity, fads and ideology don&#x27;t play any role in shaping it (they have the idea that the &quot;scientific methodology&quot; sorts everything out).

With SnowLeopard in particular, I remember three dozen releases in a row where Xcode was unusable due to obj-c garbage collection issues.  Random stuff you didn&#x27;t expect like CoreGraphics would have showstopper issues and then we&#x27;d report it and it would get fixed by the next week.<p>This resulted in extremely late releases that had a ton of bugs that we piled patches onto as time went on.<p>Craig moved the organization onto a sprint system, where we would develop new features for 2 weeks and then spend a week fixing bugs.  After 10 or 12 or 16 of these cycles, we would deem it ready and ship it out.<p>I felt this produced more stable but more conservative software.  It seemed like giant rewrites and massive features would be very difficult to introduce and if they did get done, wouldn&#x27;t happen until two thirds or so into the release cycle.<p>On the other hand, Craig has consistently been able to release on time with most of the features promised.<p>I was only there up to the release of Lion (the first Craig release), so I don&#x27;t know how updates and patches worked from then on.  Maybe they&#x27;re worse now.<p>But I&#x27;ve been using OS X all this time, and honestly I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s any worse than before.<p>What has changed is that releases and features happen more often.  Tiger and Leopard had a good 2 years to mature and get patches while their delayed successors missed target dates.  In the meantime they stagnated with ancient unix tools, safari build, QuickTime frameworks, graphics drivers etc.<p>They felt stable because they were just old, sort of like Debian stable.  Meanwhile, the development versions of Leopard and Snow Leopard (the two I spent most of my career at Apple developing) were downright horrible and unreleasable.  Each of those releases went gold and had an almost immediate .1 release to fix glaring issues.<p>It&#x27;s just that you remember them better because they had a longer history as a stable legacy OS than the modern versions.",1420429455

You just do the minimum possible to keep those existing Mac customers from jumping ship, or at least to delay the moment when they do jump ship for as long as possible.

8837058,comment,8835058,8836761,0,0,Ologn,,,"> How did it get value to begin with?<p>It never had value.  It had a price.  The price of silver in 1980 was $33 an ounce, by 1981 it was under $10 an ounce.  Pets.com had a market cap of $220 million in early 2000, by November it was bankrupt.  Subprime mortgages, Dutch tulip bulbs, history is replete with prices temporarily overshooting their values.  The difference between Bitcoin and silver, or Bitcoin and underwater real estate, is that Bitcoin is a useless hash, whereas silver and real estate have some value.<p>> All fiat currencies<p>The discussion of the price and value of fiat currencies is too complex to really cover completely in an HN comment.<p>The question about fiat currency also doesn&#x27;t mean too much for Bitcoins.  The argument seems to be &quot;it doesn&#x27;t seem to make much sense that this piece of paper is worth anything, but since it is, that means that Bitcoin is worth something&quot;.  I&#x27;m not really sure how that follows.  If it did make sense, it would also make sense for Dogecoin and Stellar and Litecoin and Ripple to have million dollar market caps, which in fact, they all do (technically any how).<p>Technically, dollars had no value even before 1971 when you could exchange them for gold.  They weren&#x27;t gold, they were just papers one could exchange for gold.  They were an abstraction of gold.<p>After 1971, the US closed the window on the 10,000 tons of gold it stores at Fort Knox and elsewhere.  At this point the dollar becomes an abstraction of an abstraction.<p>A simple announcement from the president that the gold window is open again would always put a floor under the dollar.  It&#x27;s the reason the US spends so much to store 10,000 tons of gold.  If not, why does the US store all that gold?  Wouldn&#x27;t it make sense to liquidate it and pay down US debt?  Fort Knox et al store that gold to give value to the dollar.",1420428791

The last 3-4 years or so my daily driver at work is a rMBP.<p>I use Windows 7 at home, but feel <i>about</i> as comfortable in front of either system.<p>If I compare any of the last 3-4 versions of OS X to Win 7, I&#x27;d say they&#x27;re roughly comparable. There&#x27;s pluses and minuses on both sides. I just spent a few days writing some Python code on Windows, and the experience was generally about as good as OS X. Win7 is the most rock solid non-x-nix OS I&#x27;ve used, and once you learn your way around it generally flows well.<p>I don&#x27;t perceive a huge downgrade in quality on OS X. Things change, bugs get introduced. I don&#x27;t aesthetically like where Apple is going with their flat design, but the chrome of most apps I use takes up so little real-estate of what I use that I can ignore it. I think you have to do a bit more work to get an OS X machine into a real usable state than Windows. But once it&#x27;s working it&#x27;s relatively pain free. I <i>don&#x27;t</i> think it&#x27;s as stable as Win 7. But it&#x27;s like comparing 4-9s uptime to 3-9s uptime. On a day-to-day level I don&#x27;t really notice it as much.<p>I&#x27;d say uptime on my Win 7 machines is better, but Microsoft forces restarts and updates too frequently to make that kind of claim. It&#x27;s nice that OS X is a x-nix in the sense that what I do on it is more easily translatable to other x-nix systems so deployment is easier. And that&#x27;s great until it isn&#x27;t, because some tool or library or something is different or not available. But then again, development on Windows forces you to assume all sorts of crazy non-standard stuff as a constant.<p>I don&#x27;t really know where this perception that it&#x27;s getting worse is coming from. I recently fired up my 2007-era MBP and it really feels like a worse experience, top-to-bottom. Modern OS X really is nicer.<p>I suspect that people are finally starting to look at Apple products more critically (at long last). Perhaps it&#x27;s because the pace of innovation seems to have slowed down, perhaps it&#x27;s because Jobs is gone, but I&#x27;m starting to notice Apple pundits are finally starting to see that things aren&#x27;t perhaps as good as they dreamed, and looking for ways to push the fruit forward.",1420428531

It makes things these problems feel exceedingly random.  I get to see all sorts of application quirks that pop up when the network is not behaving exactly as the application designer would&#x27;ve hoped when they decided that some cloud api call or another should transparently affect some aspect of their ui which wouldn&#x27;t even necessarily seem like a cloud behavior to a user ...

I am also a web developer and can/have worked remotely but I think that deep down one needs social interaction (even more so if you have kids!). I was also looking to minimize expenses but instead of taking a radical path I decided to control my expenses while keeping most of my lifestyle and guess what? With enough discipline and team work (your partner, if any, must agree with the plan) you may get very low on expenses without having to change too much your routine. The formula was dead obvious for me and you&#x27;ve heard it a thousand times: pay down debt, get rid of credit cards (keep a couple for EMERGENCIES), get rid of unnecessary expenses, buy used, reuse, don&#x27;t buy toys, don&#x27;t eat out too much, buy wholesale, bike to work, walk to groceries, etc. Many times the solution to a problem/want/need is not money but creativity and rational thinking, e.g. do you need a backyard b/c you want a bbq on your &#x27;own&#x27; place? You will do that bbq maybe 10 times/year. Is it worth it to buy the land/house for that reason? How about a public park for the bbq, or the outdoors? One final word: a mortgage is 99% of the time a bad (financial) decision.",1420427222

For as much as the Windows 8 / Metro thing is an annoyance, under the hood it is a solid OS - I am running it heavily loaded - 4/5 HyperV VMs, IDEs, SQL Server etc and it is thoroughly reliable even counting suspend / resume.<p>Edit: Elaborating a bit - I got a Win 8 Pro license for $39 when it initially went on sale. I run it on my HP Z series Workstation that I got refurbished for $1199+$(Disks+ 16G ECC RAM). It allows me to run with 5 disks, a 8 Core Xeon CPU, 32GB RAM. The OS came with a very good hypervisor that allows me to run older version of Windows in cheap memory footprint, RHEL 7 and Server 2012 - all decently supported.<p>If I tried doing that on Mac hardware, even ignoring the considerable cost increase, getting a reliable hypervisor on a Mac is itself a challenge. Last time I tried Fusion and Parallels they  were complete toys compared to HyperV.<p>So no, for techies Windows is still a darn attractive ecosystem - if you are just browsing and emailing any OS from 2013 onwards works fine, including Linux if you find the right hardware.",1420426976

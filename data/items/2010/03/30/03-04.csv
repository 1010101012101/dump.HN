1228328,comment,1226783,1227264,0,0,derefr,,,"The difference is that NASA uses systems engineers. From their point of view, it is not the ""program"" which can <i>have</i> bugs, but rather the ""system"" in its entirety—where ""system"" consists of the software, the hardware in the field, the hardware in the control center, and all the operations staff paid to perform certain tasks (i.e. execute algorithms—basically additional hardware.) If one part of your system (the software) needs to be rebooted, but another part (the people) is ""programmed"" to do it autonomously, then the system <i>as a whole</i> has no bugs.<p>It's sort of the thinking that goes into Erlang programs—rather than, say, thinking out complex GC strategies, you just create little process-sized vessels which grow, overflow, are killed, and then are recreated by other processes. It's not a ""bug"" that an individual process has died any more than it's a bug when one of the cells in your body dies.",1269921582

Overall, it evens out and I'm saving a ton over living in Mountain View (though, admittedly, I was living pretty luxe in Mountain View with a 1000 sq ft house a few blocks from downtown). More importantly, every day is a comfort-zone smashing experience, which I'm convinced is good for mind, body and soul.<p>I've also been twatting at <a href=""http://twitter.com/nerdnomad"" rel=""nofollow"">http://twitter.com/nerdnomad</a> and flicking at <a href=""http://flickr.com/photos/nerdnomad"" rel=""nofollow"">http://flickr.com/photos/nerdnomad</a><p>As I mentioned, I'm at Slab City, which is a truly unique American experience. Salvation Mountain is here, along with hundreds of RVers and campers, all squatting on government land and living wholly off the grid and seemingly getting along just fine. I don't think I've ever seen more solar panels in one place; and I've visited the Google campus. I do worry about where some of these folks are putting their wastewater...many of the RVs here have not moved in years, and there are no public restrooms for miles around, nor are there septic hookups. Anyway, obviously Slab City is worth blogging about, so I'll be posting about that soon, as well, along with millions of pictures.",1269921579

IMO, it doesn't take years to get ""good"" at these languages (C, because it's a smallish language; Python because it tends to obey the principle of least surprise fairly often).  With sufficiently deliberate study, I think it'd be fair to call oneself ""good"" at either C or Python after a single year.<p>I suppose I probably ought to clarify what I mean by that.  I mean that someone ""good"" at C or Python is someone who's made it over all of the typical newbie hurdles and is able to spot typical newbie mistakes more or less at a glance.  This is not someone I'd expect to have total control or mastery over the language or to know the respective standard libraries inside and out.<p>Now, to become an expert in either of them, then, sure, you're going to need many years of experience (and, if you want to claim to be a Python expert, you need to be at least ""good"" at C, IMO, because there are times when you're just going to need to suck it up and write a C extension).",1269920974

I'm just saying that 99,9% of sites don't need that and would even harm their performance by implementing it that way.<p><i>where we have a single page (the search results page) which has millions of possible feature combinations that depend entirely on the results for a specific query, and which can even vary for different users searching for the same query. [...] many megabytes</i><p>As said, how many sites have that?<p>My most javascript-heavy site makes excessive use of jquery.ui, 65 jquery plugins and ejscharts. The minified js-blob is 410kb + 100kb for ejscharts (ironically: minified using yui compressor).<p>Yes, that's pretty damn heavy, but we see no performance issues at all and I can only wonder what kind of javascript monster weighs in with multiple megabytes?",1269919404

1228246,comment,1226736,1227073,0,0,realitygrill,,,"I've enjoyed all the fictionalized accounts, but I think that if you want to learn from Musashi, you should read him directly. That's the <i>Go Rin no Sho</i> aka The Book of Five Rings. Nekopa has recommended the Cleary translation. I will recommend Hidy Ochiai's version, <i>A Way to Victory: The Annotated Book of Five Rings</i>. The annotations and analysis (after each book) really help get a sense of Musashi. Some points that stood out to me, considering that I'd read several other translations before:<p>His <i>absolute</i> priority on winning. It's not that his style is the best way to win, it's that his style is based around winning. The whole point of the book is winning! You always have to win, by any means necessary. It's very bald; the text is peppered with bits like<p><i>A tenet of my teaching is that one must win regardless of the length of the sword one uses, so I do not dictate the length of the sword. The ultimate objective of my style is to be prepared to win, no matter what weapons are involved.</i><p>and somewhat disconcertingly,<p><i>When applying martial strategy to the world of leadership, it is important that you make the acquaintance of people of good character; that you become a good leader to others; that you conduct yourself in a correct manner; that you govern people well; that you take good care of others; that you follow and maintain the laws and customs of the land for the sake of order; and that you never take second place to anyone in whatever you engage.</i><p>It's also noted that while Musashi did take on well-known opponents, especially Sasaki Kojiro, he also never dueled with several other extremely famous samurai in the same period. Ochiai notes that it is entirely consistent with his strategy to not fight if you think you will not win.<p>Directness and simplicity: <i>As I sit down here to begin writing this book, I do not intend to use any archaic words from the scriptures of Buddhism or Confucianism, nor will I depend on the examples of various writings of old war chronicles and battle tactics.</i> Musashi also considers the idea of dividing techniques into basic and advanced stupid, although he concedes that you should teach what's easiest for a beginner first, depending on the person.<p>Humility: <i>However, after the age of thirty, I started to reflect on my experiences and began to wonder whether or not my victories were attributable to my natural ability, sheer luck, or the inferior techniques of those whom I had defeated, rather than my true understanding of the principle of martial strategy.</i><p><i>Once I became enlightened by the true meaning of martial strategy, I ceased to have any real interest or desire in the worldly affairs. </i><p>Strangely individualistic: Ochiai writes, ""It’s true that Musashi intended to teach his readers to be victorious in one-to-one combat as well as in war involving armies. But if you read the book carefully, with an open mind and sincere attitude, it becomes clear that Musashi’s teaching goes far beyond that. His philosophy can be summarized as <i>ji-riki</i>; the power of each individual that emanates from within oneself. Musashi believed that <i>ji-riki</i> must be cultivated and empowered through constant effort and training. With correct understanding, his messages become concrete and personal, directly relating to the problems of living – to the human being who struggles and strives for individual achievement.""<p>Spirit of discovery: <i>It is not enough that you read what is written here, you must train as hard as if you were the one who developed the doctrine, instead of being the one who had it given to you. Train constantly as if you were the source of the discovery of the Way. Avoid mere imitation or learning without sincerity.</i>",1269918734

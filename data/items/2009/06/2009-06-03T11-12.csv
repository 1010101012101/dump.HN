So I agree.<p>2 - Our entire business is a revolutionary auto business model, so we are structured to do niche production and make that our winning strategy. Each micro-factory serves only a regional area. 2000cars max production. Kinda like IKEA or Cabella's for cars. So call it a minority and you would be right. As for desert racing. It is a big deal in the American Southwest, so we believe it will be successful. The whole point is that since people like you (and me) don't off-road race and don't really know about it, that big companies like Honda, Chevy, and BMW will never make a car that works for this minority since the market isn't big enough to support their massive tooling costs...voila a market opportunity is created for a startup company. Since the Rally Fighter is on and off road legal and seats 2 adults in front and 2 in back (or 3 car seats), it is not my definition of a toy. But I certainly want people to think of it as the most fun car and experience that they have ever bought.<p>I love your thoughts, and I so wish you were making these critiques on our forum so our community could hear your thoughts. We are about to launch a general forum and perhaps we can entice you to post there.<p>We will soon be choosing our next LM model to make with the help of our community, and we would love to have you involved in that choice.<p>Thought you might want to checkout this post last night by Jeff Jarvis on his BuzzMachine Blog.

Presumably this comes from I/O scheduling?<p>I'm aware that seek time is a serious problem, but I wonder if you could reduce the number of seek operations by reducing the number of disk I/O operations, full stop.

639568,comment,639542,639542,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Speaking of music as a tool for finding new pathways in the brain, I had a professor in college who had a serious stuttering problem.  So, rather than talk (and stutter), he sang.  All the time.  Actually, it was more of a sing-song speech pattern, but he didn't stutter when doing it, and it took me quite a while to figure out why he talked that way (and having occasion to see him stutter a couple of times when not doing the sing-song voice).<p>This led to an interesting side effect, that I always enjoyed.  Because he had a sort of steady sing-song tone, his voice was somewhat static...it wasn't obvious when he was emphasizing something.  This had the most profound effect when he told jokes, which he did quite a bit.  Unless you were really paying close attention, you'd completely miss that he'd told a joke.  All but the most obvious of his jokes went unnoticed by all but me and the girl who sat next to me at the back of the class.  So, we would occasionally get odd looks for laughing out loud for no apparent reason.  I always wanted to make him a flag with the word ""Joke!"" on it, that he could wave when making jokes.  But I wasn't sure if he'd find it funny or offensive.",1244028673

Of course, part of that means doing my job well, since providing material things like food and shelter is critical to the good life.  But at the end of the day, my work can't supersede my commitment to my family.  Our goal as a family is to foster the sort of ""home economics"" that Wendell Berry writes about--a home that is economically productive as a unit, not as separate parts.<p>That said, before I had children, I really had no grasp of what it meant to be a parent.  Ten years ago, I could have never imagined having kids, let alone being as committed to them as I am now.  I don't say this because I think I'm the greatest parent in the world (far from it, really), but because I think you really can't understand how being a parent changes your outlook on life (if you take your new role as a parent seriously).<p>If you don't have kids, good for you.

639553,comment,639330,639490,0,0,smanek,,,"Because if the language uses threads instead of processes the compiler can perform all sorts of neat optimizations on message passing.<p>As a trivial example (an example I included in the post above yours), consider 'copy-on-write' optimizations. Thread A can pass a message containing Object O (which is 50MB) to Thread B. Naively, this would be pretty expensive - however the compiler can set things up so that a copy of O isn't made until either B or A tries to write to O (in which case in can even try to just copy the part that was mutated). This provides a healthy balance between the raw performance of fork-style threads and the safety of multiple processes. This sort of optimization wouldn't be possible just using processes since, obviously, Process B couldn't (or at least shouldn't ;-)) directly look into Process A's memory space.<p>I never said don't share state - I just said don't <i>transparently</i> share state. Make it explicit and/or make it safe. As I said, it's never going to be quite as fast as raw fork-style threading but, with a sufficiently smart compiler, it can come close - and be a lot easier.",1244028160

Furthermore, anyone with a lot of BTC is incentivized to cash out slowly in order to keep the price up.<p>The Man has the upper hand, as does any weakness in the protocol. Either one, especially the latter, has the capacity to destroy bitcoin overnight. I&#x27;m not too worried about &quot;Nakamoto&quot; devaluing bitcoin (though I do wonder what &quot;Nakamoto&quot; will do with that much money/power. A billion dollars can do a lot of good or a lot of ill.).",1385236749

They claim to save &quot;60% of TOC&quot; for not having to buy a dedicated datacenter building and cooling system, which sounds reasonable in the short term (although, eventually a datacenter-builder will recoup the costs of construction, while an electricity premium is constant.)  It looks like homeowner also pays Nerdalize to sign on- which may make their balance sheet more reasonable, but is also only a short-term advantage if the server is leased indefinitely.<p>In the long-run, they&#x27;re probably just banking on people paying a modest premium for &quot;green computation.&quot;",1385236686

6787217,comment,6786675,6786893,11,0,mjn,,,"The mere existence of a union shouldn&#x27;t prevent dismissal cases from prevailing, though, unless something else is seriously wrong with the adversarial process. I&#x27;m represented by a union [1], and as a result I could ask my union for advice and/or support, if my job was terminated or if I were otherwise disciplined. Their lawyers would look into it and determine: 1) what advice to give me; and 2) whether there is a violation of rights serious enough to threaten the collective interest of the union members, thereby justifying the union themselves lodging an objection.<p>But the union would not defend me if their lawyers thought the dismissal was according to procedures and with sufficient evidence; it&#x27;s not considered in the union&#x27;s interest to defend clearly bad employees, and in practice they object in only a minority of dismissals. Even when they do lodge an objection in a given case, there is hardly any guarantee they will prevail. Why don&#x27;t police unions work like that? My guess is a mixture of factors, relating to both cultural aspects (the &quot;no snitching&quot; culture) and ineffective oversight or even outright collusion from people who are supposed to be their adversaries in such procedures, such as judges.<p>[1] <a href=\"http://www.dm.dk/da/OmDM/Organisationen/English\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.dm.dk/da/OmDM/Organisationen/English</a>",1385236604

6787207,comment,6786128,6786371,9,0,grey-area,,,"<i>Be outraged that we&#x27;re spying on your country if that makes you feel better, I guess. I&#x27;d rather nobody spied on each other either.</i><p>Opposition to the tactics of the NSA/GCHQ does not require you to be opposed to the existence of spies. That&#x27;s an old, tired argument, which we didn&#x27;t need to go into the first time. Of course spies spy, but should they do so without boundaries, without proper supervision, and above the law? Should they do so outside wartime and on allies? Should they be given the very real capacity to subvert our democracies and networks worldwide? Who then will keep them in check if the head of the NSA decides he wants regime change at home? How will we know if this has happened?<p>Personally I don&#x27;t think this world-weary acceptance of lawbreaking is an appropriate response, and I&#x27;m outraged that spies in my country (GCHQ) have been collaborating with collection of data worldwide and handing it over to the NSA, without any respect for international law or the interests of their own country.<p>The important discussion to be had is on where the boundaries to NSA surveillance lie, and how to perform adequate supervision of them, and just what laws they are not allowed to break. At the very least I think we need a proper inquiry into those topics, which we have not been offered thus far. Spies could (and have) assassinate, kidnap, subvert the political process, and break into networks worldwide but should they do those things to allies and domestically? Should we fund them to keep doing it? Should we accept the perpetual state of war which has been engendered by wars on terrorism and drugs, and the use of that to justify tyranny, assassination and subversion of the democratic process? If we say they can and will do all these things, because it&#x27;s just what they do, we might as well given up on the pretence of a democracy we currently enjoy.<p>There are very good reasons the NSA is not supposed to be used domestically, and I&#x27;d argue those reasons should also extend to allies, if only because not doing so means your country will no longer have any real allies at all. Why should anyone trust the US or UK in trade negotiations when they&#x27;ve been shown to cheat and steal at every opportunity? Why should Sri Lanka say not just laugh in the face of the UK when Cameron talks of human rights, and China laugh in the face of the US when it complains about intrusive industrial espionage? The blowback on this topic is very real and deep and is only going to be reinforced by reactions like yours above which come down to &#x27;spies will be spies&#x27;. The defensive capabilities of the NSA should be far more important than the offensive ones in my opinion, particularly in times of peace. Acting as if you are in a perpetual state of war with other nations, including your closest allies and even domestic population, <i>will</i> lead them to treat you the same way.<p>The spies have become a supranational organisation which apparently doesn&#x27;t feel it is answerable to anyone; even the politicians who are ostensibly in charge of them. I think that&#x27;s dangerous and worthy of note.",1385236495

This is flow of telemetry in a single direction -- to the realtouch.  Our devices create a tethered sense of physical intimacy and connection. One partner feels whats happening with the other side, and vice versa, simultaneously.  Also, our design has all the moving parts on the outside, which we feel is more appealing than sticking your penis into an opaque grinding box.  (Our devices are <i>very</i> quiet btw, will be adding new videos next week to demonstrate)<p>You can imagine when we add support for the realtouch that other devices on the platfrom such as the robot itself and accelerometer products will be able to send telemetry to the device to control its functions, and vice versa, the joystick would be able to send telemetry to the robots to manipulate a fleshlight/tenga/sleeve.  It&#x27;s really a robust api that enables all devices to interact where their functionalities overlap.<p>However, we should all be supportive of realtouch right now -- it appears they&#x27;re having licensing issues with a certain patent holder that is turning the screws on them and without intervention they wont be able to continue selling devices next year.  Dealing with this minefield of patents and licensing has been an important predicate for our development at frixion, and we are eager to create a &quot;safe haven&quot; for other developers to deploy their devices under the agreements we hold in the future.",1385236095

The photographer retains copyright of photos, and sued the companies for regular copyright violation. One of the companies&#x27; defenses was to claim that they actually had a license, and therefore it was not a copyright violation. Users who tweet photos do grant certain royalty-free reproduction rights to both Twitter, and third-party syndicators authorized by Twitter. See section 5 here: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tos\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://twitter.com/tos</a>. Therefore, if AFP were using the photos in accordance with terms authorized by Twitter, they would be covered by this license, and they wouldn&#x27;t be violating the photographer&#x27;s copyright.<p>The judge ruled that their reuse was not within the scope of these terms, however, and therefore not covered by that grant of a royalty-free license. Therefore the defense fails, and they&#x27;re assessed damages, not for the Twitter ToS violation, but for reproducing photos without a valid license from the photographer.",1385235065

We are talking about sources of blackmail, kidnapping and ransom becoming literally completely untraceable, without even a network effect of where the money is going afterward (what pseudonymous addresses).<p>As for the infrastructural, nuclear and so forth examples, you will observe that placing or turning moles and spies already occurs historically, which shows that the process is possible.

So I think you&#x27;re right that nobody cares about someone&#x27;s most recent all-inclusive resort vacation, but I think there are many people who are interested in living vicariously through the adventures of others (possibly moreso if the &quot;others&quot; are somehow known to them) if the adventures really are unique.<p>During and since that trip, I have often thought about building something to make sharing those kind of experiences easier. I think TripStamp hits some of those points, but one major problem that would be difficult for TripStamp to solve in its current incarnation is that of being able to make updates while offline, and have them sync whenever internet is available. (I&#x27;d often write blog posts in my tent at night and then upload them from whatever public WiFi I could find the next day, and I think that would apply even more to people travelling in remote locations where a lot of this &quot;exciting&quot; travel happens.)",1385233748

Different block devices?  Different network devices?  Wrong CPU architecture?  Wrong virtualdisk format?  Some other magic of some sort?  It can be awhile before you even get the machine up and running, to say nothing about running services.<p>In contrast, a scripted install starts with a running, networked machine and if any point in the install procedure fails, you&#x27;ll know what point it failed will have a detailed error message explaining why.  You can read the script to see what it&#x27;s trying to do and may be able to either correct the script for the new environment or correct the environment for the script.  You can make steady progress towards restoration while if the VM restoration fails, you just keep slamming your head into the brick wall until it gives way.<p>It&#x27;s true in many situations that restoring a virtual machine snapshot is much faster and easier than a rebuild and data-restore.

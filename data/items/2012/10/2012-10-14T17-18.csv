4652009,comment,4651165,4651374,5,0,dulse,,,"I'd be interested to see a list of the best philosophy books for non-philosophers. I'm not a philosopher or close to the field, but I always thought Thomas Nagel's Mortal Questions was a big hitter. Not so much for an individual essay but the combination of essays - What Is it Like to be a Bat? and The Absurd are both classics in my mind. Basically every essay in that short book is great, completely understandable to the lay-person, has the potential to be deeply influential to one's everyday beliefs, and is philosophically rigorous.<p>Philosophical Investigations is beyond my ability to follow as is Heidegger (I think it's a common complain against continental philosophy in general). Kripke's Naming and Necessity is something I can understand, but I don't really feel the 'oomph' to the insight that there can be a posteriori necessary truths and apriori contingent truths. Obviously it's a deeply important fact, and an astonishing breakthrough. But it doesn't hit me in the same way as Nagel's Absurd, which attempts to break down and dismiss existential dread. I don't think he succeeds, exactly, but it feels important and deeply insightful.",1350237105

I wrote a proprietary RTE last year and continue to maintain it because nothing available both worked and produced clean markup. Redactor came out this spring and is the only generally available RTE that does this. If you insist on OSS, WYSIHTML5 is the best available.<p>For those that care, Redactor uses the designMode technique, leans on the browser for most operations and keeps the markup clean via regexp cleanup. This is the cleanest solution for the most common use case of html email/html item entry. The other two techniques are full emulation and contenteditable.<p>Google uses full emulation in their products. You type into a hidden text field and the display/selection/cursor is entirely script rendered. This is especially good for things like docs where they need to emulate word's behavior. Downside is that doing it is a lot of code and it's easy to miss OS specific keybinds (e.g. CMD+left/right in OS X don't work in gmail).<p>Using contenteditable would be the preferred technique but it's buggy as hell. Of the editors I know about only Aloha and my editor take this approach. The amount of code is relatively small (mine is around 2k sloc) but it's all really ugly code that reminds me of the bad old days in 2002-2004 when I had my own DOM abstraction lib.",1350236474

The vast majority are primarily written in systems-style C++ (basically, C++ minus several popular features).<p>Most of the knocks against C++ are micro-optimizations that are not material to the actual parallelization of the code. Parallelization is done by carefully selecting and designing the distributed data structures, which is simple to do in C++. For parallel systems these are required (theoretically) to be space decomposition structures, which happen to be very elegant to implement in C. Communication between cells in the space decomposition is conventional message passing.<p>The usual compiler-based tricks such as loop parallelization are not all that helpful even though supercomputing compilers support it. By the time you get to that level of granularity, it is a single process locked to a single core, so there is not much hardware parallelism to exploit. And even then, you have to manually tune the behavior with pragmas if you want optimal performance.<p>Most compiler-based approaches to parallelism attack the problem at a level of granularity that is not that useful for non-trivial parallelism.

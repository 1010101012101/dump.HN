For instance, why does it take ""days"" to realize the sun is shining through the window and then two more to have someone who's not that great at putting up blinds put them up? Get someone in, fix the problem, get them out, bing-bang-boom, and you have a happy hacker, given most hackers I know. Take 5 days for something that should take 2 at the most (1 day to see the sun issue, 1 more to put up blinds) doesn't make people ""secure in the knowledge that he is being...supported.""",1228175815

To some degree having them realize that it doesn't come easy helps yes, but linking it to work is not the only way. You can link it to good behavior, grades, self control, and many other things that are more valuable to teach than how to work for other people.<p>Plus some of the most important lessons in employment can not be taught until after the person has their first real job. Such as: the company does not care about you. They just want to squeeze as much work as possible, for the least pay. They will give artificial deadlines and scarcity to try to get you work more efficiently. They will try to get you to be loyal to them ""be a team player"".<p>It's pretty hard to teach those things if that first employer is you.<p>Personally BTW I don't give an allowance at all. I see no need to teach kids how to spend money. (i.e. get in the habit of spending money) If you need something you (your parents) buy it, that's all. You don't need to spend all the money you make - which is what happens usually with allowances (or they save for a while for something, which is the same thing - spend what you get).",1228175653

This UDP-based reliable transport is designed to minimize latency, but still maximize bandwidth when the latency is not excessive. We use this for communication between peers instead of TCP, if both sides support it. In addition, we use information from this transport, if active, to control the transfer rate of TCP connections. This means uTorrent, when using uTP, should not kill your net connection - even if you do not set any rate limits.<p>----<p>Just to re-iterate and offer a few more details (there's some pretty wild press reports popping up):
Firon described uTP completely accurately. 
uTP is the result of a couple of years of work to try to make a Bittorrent protocol that works better on the internet.<p>The switch to uTP is at this point purely experimental, but the design objective (counter to some reports in the press) is actually to offer better congestion control than TCP offers, but maintain the same level of performance (speed). 
Better congestion control is good for everyone – for users (VOIP, Gamers etc.) as well as for ISPs. 
Same performance is what users have come to expect from their BitTorrent application – unless we can offer the same performance, then people will switch to a different BitTorrent client. (In reality we may be able to offer faster speeds too in many circumstances, but this is a byproduct and not the main objective.)<p>uTP is our UDP-based implementation of the BitTorrent protocol. 
Normally BitTorrent is implemented on top of TCP which is the standard congestion control mechanism for the internet. 
It so happens that the congestion control mechanism inside TCP is quite crude and problematic. It only detects congestion on the internet once “packet loss” has occurred – i.e. once the user has lost data and (probably) noticed there is a problem. The problems of TCP are fairly well known in technical circles, but it doesn’t get fixed as TCP is one of those protocols that is implemented in every webserver and application (e.g. browsers, bittorrent clients) on the internet. Co-ordinating a giant upgrade is a very long process.<p>Because BitTorrent publishes the world’s most popular BitTorrent clients AND because these clients are talking mostly to each other (not to web servers), then we have an opportunity to detect end-to-end congestion and implement a protocol that can detect problems very quickly and throttle back accordingly so that BitTorrent doesn’t slow down the internet connection and Gamers and VOIP users don’t notice any problems. This is our objective.<p>This is great news for users of the internet and even for ISPs as it should mean that people make far more efficient use of internet bandwidth, but don’t over-use it to destruction. If uTP is successful, then internet congestion due to BitTorrent protocol could become a thing of the past. Of course there are many other applications that use the internet and they may also cause congestion, but we can only control what we do. Having said that, given that some press reports suggest that BitTorrent traffic constitutes half of all traffic on the internet, our technology might have a profound impact. We’re trying to do our bit to be responsible citizens on the internet.<p>While uTP is for now a proprietary BitTorrent protocol, we are also co-chairing an IETF group to address these issues. Hopefully that will lead to solutions that can be standardized and broadly adopted in due course.<p>- Simon Morris

It would still be a parody, anti-Mac people would still like it, but it would be accurate to what Apple really is. And that's what irritates me: not that they spent 6 minutes attacking Apple, which is a gratuitous amount of time for a paltry amount of jokes, but that they didn't make fun of what Apple ACTUALLY is: a company with a cult-like following and an obsession for perfectionism, even when said perfectionism borders on the insane. That's hilarious. The funny Apple parodies focus on that. This wasn't an Apple parody so much as it was an Apple insult.",1228173243

Problem was, he had never managed to win enough respect or influence from the development team to actually do things. He didn't work out so well; despite being smart and competent, he didn't earn the leadership position he thought he deserved. He would have been better off thinking about new features we should develop, writing specs to outline the benefits of these features, and winning the developers' trust through action instead of waiting for the title.<p>Another management trainee didn't care what his title was: He came up with a new idea for a program and persuaded the team that it was a good idea.

Now can you link to a Simpson's parody you like and explain how the joke is better because it takes informed digs where informed means you have to have used and experienced the product, which may only be a few % of the viewership, to understand the humor? 
From what I remember, The Simpsons has parodied everything, even if it works and is sacred. The Simpsons also parodies mainstream culture too, and the Apple has only recently taken its place in the mainstream and not by corrupting what it stands for, but by supplanting cultural values. The Simpsons parodies this uptake of culture. Think of this not as an anti-Apple creed, but as a nod in their direction for having finally arrived on the stage, and not being off in some geeks only enclave.",1228172458

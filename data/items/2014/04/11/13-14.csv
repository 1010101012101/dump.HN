7572834,comment,7571327,7571327,1,0,graycat,,,"Looks to me like A16Z is blowing it.  If Ben Horowitz\nprides himself on good management of technical work as suggested by his blog posts, then he didn&#x27;t work very hard on the project of the OP.<p>Issues:<p>(1) Engineering School.  Uh, guys, here in the US we have\nuniversities with schools of engineering -- MIT, Johns Hopkins, CMU, Georgia Tech, etc.  Running a good engineering school is a lot of hard work.  But this A16Z project has A16Z being their own engineering school, that is, specifying &#x27;course material&#x27;, testing for it, and deciding on pass/fail.  Somehow it seems a bit arrogant for \nA16Z to believe that they can do the work of an engineering\nschool.<p>A16Z gets really off the track with their,<p>> A BS/MS/PhD in Computer Science or the equivalent is nice to have, but the most important requirement is significant independent programming experience as demonstrated by your GitHub account, personal projects, academic publications, or startup success.<p>Wow!  &quot;PhD in Computer Science&quot; ... &quot;is nice to have, but&quot;...!  Gee, guys, just shut down MIT, Johns Hopkins, CMU, Georgia Tech, etc. because now A16Z is here with &quot;the right stuff&quot;!<p>Next, for their &quot;as demonstrated by ... academic publications&quot;, sorry, A16Z, &quot;academic publications&quot; are not\nat all about &quot;programming experience&quot;.  Instead, the usual criteria are &quot;new, correct, and significant&quot; where &quot;programming&quot; really does not count more than, say, just the word processing for the paper.<p>(2) Machine Learning.  Good grief!  That &quot;machine learning&quot; is about &quot;scatterplots & histograms, logistic/linear regression, R/Matlab&quot; fills a &quot;much needed gap in the literature&quot; and &quot;would be illuminating if ignited&quot;.  Their definition is for a &#x27;statistical data assistant&#x27; mostly just for &#x27;descriptive statistics&#x27;.  Ever hear of J. Tukey?  Ah, I&#x27;ll be nice to you guys; not fun to be too harsh on small children!<p>Then there is their unforgettable,<p>> If you also know enough data science/machine learning to design useful metrics for dashboards and workflows, that’s a major plus.<p>Uh, ever hear of reliability and validity?  You have three\nhours to respond here with a relevant description!  You are not permitted to use Google or Wikipedia!<p>(3) Ego.  It appears that the A16Z specification was\nwritten by someone who has enough ego to believe that\ntheir own &#x27;skill set&#x27; is just &quot;the right stuff&quot;.<p>(4) Linux.  People programming on Microsoft&#x27;s\nplatform can have done well but encountered \nonly a small fraction of the topics in the A16Z\ndocument.  The document is mostly about Linux.\nSorry, guys, I&#x27;m writing in Visual Basic .NET;\nno, C# has too much of the deliberately &#x27;idiosyncratic&#x27;\nsyntax of C which I find too error prone and hate.<p>(5) Three Letter Acronyms (TLAs).  It appears that A16Z\nis using obscure TLAs as code word filters.  Hmm.<p>So, they have ORMs.  Gee, what the heck is that?  So, Google a little and get a Wikipedia entry and discover ORM abbreviates &#x27;object-relational mapping&#x27;.  Okay.  Sure, if write the software with objects and keep the data in a relational database, then need move data between objects and tables.  Given the huge variety of objects and tables, tough to believe that there is a significant &#x27;subject&#x27; here.<p>Then there is their ETL.  Google again and discover that\nthat TLA abbreviates &quot;extract, transform, and load&quot;.  So that is essentially &#x27;extracting&#x27; data from whatever\noriginal sources, &#x27;transforming&#x27; the data as needed by the work to be done, and &#x27;loading&#x27; the data into a data base.  Okay.  Sounds entirely routine.  I&#x27;m surprised they didn&#x27;t also list (A) LRT, look at a screen, read it, and type in what need, (B) PSS for put on shoes and socks, (C) SDP for start car, drive to the office, and park the car, and\nespecially the crucially important (D) GSL for Google a question, select the promising results, and learn what needed.  One more:  WTH, waste time on Hacker News!<p>Okay, A16Z, two can play this game:  Think of a large server farm or internet protocol network.  Since this &#x27;facility&#x27; is subject to errors of wide variety, it is important to monitor the facility for unexpected problems of wide variety, say, from software errors, hardware failures, system administration errors, security breaches, etc.  To do this collect some data, say, from Microsoft&#x27;s instrumentation means, HP&#x27;s Mercury Interactive, what a relational database management system or Cisco box can report, etc.  So, maybe 100 times a second, collect numerical data on each of 25 variables.  Now we want \na detector of &#x27;anomalies&#x27;, including for problems never seen\nbefore, that is, &#x27;zero-day&#x27; problems.  Such monitoring is\nessentially hypothesis testing.  So, we want a suitable\nhypothesis test.  Due to the fact that the multi-dimensional\nprobability distribution of that 25 dimensional data\nis essentially impossible to describe at all accurately,\nwe need an hypothesis test that is &#x27;distribution-free&#x27;.\nSince the data is 25 dimensional, our test must also\nbe &#x27;multi-dimensional&#x27;.  We want false alarm rate\nknown in advance and adjustable in small steps over\na wide range.  And we want a good shot at doing nearly\nas well as the Neyman-Pearson result but with much\nless data than that result requires.  Okay, A16Z, your\nmission, and I&#x27;d like to see you accept it, is to\nsay how to do that.  Of course, since you guys are so\ngood and brilliant, you already know my published paper\nfor the answer.  But there is a typo in the paper.  Where\nis it?  You have three hours to post your response here.<p>Also needed, find a fast way to do the specified\ncomputations.  I found a way, but that is not\nin the paper.  You have 24 hours to post the\nanswer to this part!  Don&#x27;t report your answer\nin some silly way such a running code.  Instead,\nreport your answer in clear English\nwith any appropriate mathematics written\nas high quality mathematical writing,\ne.g., W. Rudin.  Go for it, guys!<p>Uh, you\nwon&#x27;t find the answer on Google or GitHub!\nAnd asking around Silicon Valley won&#x27;t help, either.\nYou might want to rush off to the\nRAD lab project of Patterson and Fox funded\nby Google, Microsoft, and Sun for when\nthey worked on such problems, but that won&#x27;t\nhelp, either.<p>My view:  Here A16Z showed that their understanding of\ncomputing is still down at the level of a junior high\nself taught programmer.",1397224674

A lot of the modifications to source done by redistributors of GPL&#x27;d software is not really well formed nor suitable for upstream.  It&#x27;s that classic kind of &quot;it just works, but it&#x27;s ugly&quot; code.<p>This is particular true with regard to the &quot;scripts to control compilation and installation of the executiable&quot; which is a required part of the complete, corresponding source, provision of which the GPL mandates.<p>Situations like the WRT54G (the GPL enforcement source release of which launched the OpenWRT project) and the Samsung TV lawsuit that I helped do (which launched the SammyGo project: <a href=""http://www.samygo.tv/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.samygo.tv/</a> are excellent examples of what great things happen when the GPL is enforced: reaching the promise of copyleft, which is hackable devices downstream.<p>This is why I&#x27;ve spent(and probably will spend) most of my professional life enforcing the GPL.<p>This post here is about a few specific issues, but if you want more general information on the topic, dalke&#x27;s link to my talk is probably helpful.

No doubt the pirates have done some bad things that are (and should be!) crimes. But just piling on the warships and spec-ops to interdict/kill all of them isn&#x27;t exactly the best way to solve it, as it appears to leave one of the root causes of the phenomenon untouched anyways. We can draw parallels to American street gangs. Yes, they do totally crappy stuff. But now that we bothered studying them, we can see part of the reason of their existence is that they fill a hole in the lives of many young people in certain situations. This by no ways truly justifies theirs actions, but helps explains them, and ultimately if we want to resolve the problem in a real way (beyond just killing them all), we need to listen.<p>b) Worthy causes can be linked to unworthy actions. People struggle with this all the time. Some people have trouble allowing any blemishes on the characters that lead their cause.

List((),1,2,3).toSet() is true. The programmer probably wanted List(1,2,3).toSet.\n  * The val code on slide 6 throws a null pointer exception because triple isn&#x27;t initialised by the time it is evaluated. Languages like Haskell where order isn&#x27;t important are nice, but Scala is not such a language. On slide 7 the int isn&#x27;t initialised.\n  * The return in lambda thing is probably a good reason never to use return in Scala if you are doing functional programming, in which case you don&#x27;t need it. If you aren&#x27;t doing functional programming, the semantics of returning from the outer function are useful.\n  * The Seq-ish example on slide 12 is confusing mainly because the comment is confusing. p is an Iterable, meaning that it is traversable once. Asking for the size traverses it, so at the point of the comment, it has been traversed already, and so p.size is in fact 0 (no remaining elements). It could be fixed easily by writing val p = Seq(1,2,3).permutations.toList\n  * The map comparison is unfair, because the Scala example is more general - the Haskell and Clojure examples work over a particular data structure only.</code></pre>",1397221327

Last time I researched this (2 years ago), a Datacenter license covered an unlimited number of guests on that host.<p>That said, I think most businesses where this really matters have an Enterprise Agreement with a yearly true-up. We&#x27;re mid sized (<1000) and we have one. No idea what we actually pay, but having an EA and a working KMS infrastructure at least treats the symptoms.<p>I guess the OS licensing is really one of the bigger annoyances though. All these guys waxing poetic about how great Visual Studio and C# and MVC.NET and whatever are, might not be singing the same tune if those products weren&#x27;t being subsidized by the other components they rarely have to think about.",1382525961

[I have borrowed from such sources but have always needed to modify the code].

Then I tested on Nexus 7 and Nexus 10 tablets, and bunch of phones that friends have and I&#x27;ve seen ugly streching effect, so I first tried just to keep the aspect ratio with black bars (letterboxing and pillarboxing), but this did not look too good.<p>Then I enlarged the background nebulas and stars textures and the game adapts to the screen. If you have 16:10 screen it fits perfectly. If you have wider screen, there would be some free space at the sides. On Nexus 7 and 10, that&#x27;s just some 10% and it&#x27;s hardly noticable.<p>On devices that are wider than 16:10, say some phones with 480x854 resolution, I simply extend the playing field upwards. So it&#x27;s actually a little bit easier to play on those devices as aliens have more space to travel before they reach the bottom. I thought about increasing the initial speed modifier for those devices from 1 to 1.0675, but I did not do it. I somehow wanted to speed of the game to be constant.<p>Using libGDX as a library makes testing all this very easy, because you can run in on your desktop as a regular Java application and you can resize the window to whatever you like. I have 1680x1050 monitor, so all phones and most tablets fit the screen.<p>The only thing I regret is not having Nexus 10 at the very start and make the game optimal for 2560x1600 resolution. There are many popular Android games that do not support this fully (graphics get blurred). The only 2D game I&#x27;ve seen so far is Angry Birds Star Wars II. So maybe if I supported this high resolution, I would have a better shot at being featured in the Play Store, since competition is low. If this version goes well, maybe this is exaclty what I will do next: build a HD version.",1382523180

Much of the community is tied down to proprietary API&#x27;s which would mean being sucked into the MS ecosystem, meaning I&#x27;d have to kill off over half my potential market. Microsoft makes some wonderful things, but only in reaction to their competitors. Almost everything they make is better. But that&#x27;s the problem. As soon as they have you, you&#x27;re trapped. Then it&#x27;s down the rabbit hole, and you&#x27;ll find bugs you can&#x27;t fix. Hideous work arounds. Limitations that force upgrading products. You&#x27;re going to get stressed.<p>I&#x27;m not a Linux, Google, or Apple shill; but I this is why I refuse to be pulled into the Microsoft ecosystem. I simply can&#x27;t respect Microsoft as they are still blatantly trying EEE with mobile/ tablet/ laptop markets. It will be sad day if Microsoft actually achieves a monopoly on any of these markets, because they&#x27;ll stop innovating. They&#x27;ll come out with closed libraries that only work on their devices. They&#x27;ll force you to do things their way.<p>I&#x27;m not delusional, MS competitors aren&#x27;t saints. But they all never seem to stoop that low. Shit, even Google Chrome _asks_ you if you want to use Bing as a search provider.",1382522913

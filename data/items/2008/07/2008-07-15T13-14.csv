I think there likely is some cognitive secret sauce that makes some people much more likely to be competent programmers, but I don't think it's maladjustment.

If it's all one table it's essentially just one read.<p>Now, there are many many caveats to all of this (how indexes are setup, relative sizes of tables, etc. but in general it is more computationally expensive to do more joins).",1216129983

246627,comment,246477,246617,0,0,pavelludiq,,,"I will explain. I work on my self. Most people around me waste their time. They just want to go get drunk or something. Some of them are ambitious, but most of them just say they are. A girl from my class says she wants to become a layer ant thinks that she can become one without any understanding of rhetorics or any other essential theory needed for that job. She doesn't even try to get good grades in the classes that she will need(she got some good grades but that is through obedience in school, not knowledge or any understanding of the subject). A lot of people around me are like that. They try to go the easy way. I am more ambitious. When i was a kid, me and my friends tried to make ice cream money through a lot of different means(some of them illegal too) Like selling sandwiches or cleaning houses and stuff like that. Most kids just watched TV, i was learning about the world, understanding my surroundings and  looking for options. I knew from an early age that i had potential. My plan is simple. Go through school, and get in to a good university(all i have to do is get through a few math tests and i have a whole year to get ready) Then just study, have fun and meet people. Then if i actually get somewhere i might not graduate, but i think that i will get to the end probably(as a safety net) Then start a startup in Bulgaria, probably will not make a lot of money, but my hope is that it will be enough to move to the USA(or any other startup hub that may be existing in 8-10 years) and make money there. Of course  it might not happen that way, so i don't make strict plans, i just try to learn to hack, its hard, because there are not a lot of good hackers near my town.",1216129294

246620,comment,246477,246477,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"Go to college for at least one year. The act of finishing high school with decent grades and getting admitted to a decent college (a state university, at least) is a basic badge of competence that will serve as a useful social signal for the rest of your life. Among people who went to college, high school dropouts get zero respect; even the ones who are rich get only the respect they can <i>buy</i>. I know that's unfair, but that's society for you.<p>Both Bill Gates and Steve Jobs went to college. They dropped out after a year, but I assure you that the first year is <i>important</i>. Among other things, you might decide that you really like college: It's completely different from high school, not merely because you're no longer in a minimum-security prison, but also because some of the smartest people on earth are literally eating lunch in the seat next to you.<p>OTOH, college is <i>very</i> expensive and you might decide you don't need it. But first go for a year and get the best grades that you can, given that you intend to spend every available hour hacking on your part-time startups. :) After you've been admitted to college and done a year of decent work, it will be that much easier to get readmitted to college, one or two or five years down the road. It will improve your maneuvering room, it will place you in the college-student social class (which might very well be the one you're marketing to, and the one your coworkers are in...) and it will be that much easier to tell the story of your life to a future employer, customer, or bank manager: ""I did well in school and went to college, but then got distracted by my startup company and took a year off, but then the startup tanked so I went back to school for a couple of years before my <i>second</i> startup hit it big.""",1216128548

246614,comment,246477,246512,0,0,wheels,,,"I don't mean to suggest dropping out, but it's not necessarily as bad as you imply.  I dropped out at 16 (12 years ago) and still managed to go to a good college, and have had a series of good jobs.<p>More problematic things that I see:<p>You'll need an older co-founder.  Justified or not, business folk and investors aren't going to take you seriously at 17.  Not to mention that you won't be able to rent hotel rooms for business travel, or cars where need be, won't be able to open a business bank account, etc.<p>If it doesn't work out in the first go, which realistically speaking is probably for any first-off startup, you're not going to have a lot to show for it when you're, say, 18 or 19 and throw in the towel.  Actually the worst case is it just stringing you along but not really going anywhere and it getting frustrating late to start college.<p>In my case, despite ""making it"", I still view dropping out as more or less a mistake.  It didn't really screw up my life in any significant way, but looking back on it, it's just nine months of part-time, easy work.  Nine months is nothing.  I spent six months (while working full-time) just trying to learn what I'd need to know to jump into a start up before going full-time on it.<p>My brother was smarter about it.  He just decided to not take any honors classes, set up about half of his time senior year to be internship hours and skimmed by putting in almost no effort.  You could probably intern in your own company if you had an older co-founder...",1216127548

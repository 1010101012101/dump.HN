A specific one that I can point ol' Chrome at?<p>More science, less startup. That's all I'm askin'. I do not care what Steve Jobs said to a guy who's iPhone was too beepy. I do care that a professor at MIT has claimed he's got a widget to beat photosynthesis, and I do care that someone's unearthed a video of bookbinding as practiced in 1947.<p>Certainly, I appreciate that I would be doing myself a disservice if I insisted that all I read, watched, or heard were something that I had already approved. I have no expectations that a community perfectly support anything.

A few observations we found:<p>Meat and organic food was too expensive.<p>Fruit is crazy expensive so we bought OJ from concentrate with no additives as a cheap source of Vitamin C.<p>Eggs were are very expensive, but we needed the protein and nutrients, so rationed ourselves to 3 each per week.<p>We had to remove all sugar to save on cost and sugar crashed badly.<p>We decided that Costco was cheating due to the $70 membership fee and so we alternated between Safeway and Walmart.<p>You quickly learn the difference between broccoli florets and stems. [Stems are cheaper]<p>Baking your own bread is incredibly cheap and if you're using a sourdough starter you just need flour, salt and water. It's a great staple and adds taste to the meal. I scraped the unused flour off the work bench and dumped it back in the sourdough starter to save on cost.<p>Lentils are the most complete non-meat protein source.<p>Combining beans and rice give you a complete protein.<p>Cheese is too expensive and you can't make cheese from regular organic off-the-shelf homogenized ultra-pasteurized milk. It just doesn't set when you add the rennet.<p>You can buy coffee for $1 for a months worth of ground coffee at walmart. It's called Master Chef and it tastes like a used catbox.<p>Before we did our experiment we found a few ""living on a dollar a day"" blogs, but every single one bought in bulk and then calculated the cost of each scoop they took out of the bin. They also didn't care about nutritional completeness and basically starved themselves for the period.<p>After trying to do this on $1.70 and failing, I think Mike's budget of $3 is probably a realistic per person budget if you're going to stay healthy.",1303962617

Here's the thing though: we shouldn't need to vote in order to determine what adds to the discussion. Certainly some fairly straightforward heuristics like Flesch-Kincaid (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flesch%E2%80%93Kincaid_readability_test) Grade Level times number of replies (possibly adding in a factor for the F-K Grade Level of the replies to weed out long chains of drivel) should be relatively good at picking the best comments in a thread.<p>I'm not saying that voting should be eliminated entirely, but maybe it becomes just part of the heuristic. Imagine something like BCS standings, but for comments. Even vote tallies could become smarter, with votes from ""trusted"" users counting more heavily than those from ""noobs"" or well known rabble-rousers.<p>Finally, I think it would be really neat (assuming you like my proposal of a combined heuristic in place of voting) if the algorithm was open source.

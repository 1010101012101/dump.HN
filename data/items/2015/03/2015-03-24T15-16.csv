   Unfortunately not. We have a significant amount of code
   that is not open source; in terms of rules, only ~10% of 
   the rules are open source at this point. We did an 
   experiment where we marked all changes that crossed the
   internal and external code bases over the course of a few 
   weeks, only to discover that a lot of our changes still 
   cross both code bases.</code></pre>",1427212792

It is buggy beyond belief, distributed mode is deeply flawed, transactions are not transactional, it&#x27;s super easy to hang the database and the explain keyword straight up lies, the backup strategy is non-existent, the documentation incredibly poor and riddled with typos and outright mistakes. When we finally thought we&#x27;d got over these issues, we imported our data and the system ground to a halt, just weeks before a major product launch.<p>Luckily we were able to move to Postgres pretty quickly, but choosing OrientDB nearly sank the company, choosing it was an inaffordable mistake.<p>Also, look at this list of issues closed as &quot;invalid/wontfix&quot;, it seems like you&#x27;re a lot keener to close issues than to actually fix them - <a href=""https://github.com/orientechnologies/orientdb/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+label%3Ainvalid"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/orientechnologies/orientdb/issues?utf8=%E...</a>",1427212752

It&#x27;s the fact that I was tricked into buying a product only by its description and position on the menu.

You&#x27;re using a strawman (can&#x27;t get ROI in GA) backed by a conspiracy theory (it&#x27;s to make you spend with AdWords!) without disclosing up front that you have a competing product.<p>Google Analytics is a powerful tool, as you say, and as a result it has a steep learning curve. With that said, calculating the ROI on a marketing effort is not as difficult as you make it seem.<p>Using goals and ecommerce tracking, you can see the (dollar) return from any source, cohort, or time period. All that&#x27;s missing is the input (investment), which only you know. Divide your investment by the return and you have your ROI for any segment you choose.<p>The entire issue with last-click attribution is not really an issue. Not only can you change this setting, but also you can view &quot;Multi-channel funnels&quot; and see every touchpoint (channel) of a user, even if they didn&#x27;t convert on the first visit.<p>From a quick glance at Tend, it looks like your value offering is showing the same multi-channel funnel that GA shows, just with a nicer interface.

Even if we say you can cut half of that out (Social Security, Medicare/Medicaid, etc), let&#x27;s call it $2 trillion dollars.<p>So we need $11 trillion dollars of tax money to fund this. The total net worth of US private people is $67 trillion or so[1]. The aggregate net worth of the top 400 people in the USA is $2.3 trillion[2]. You could take all of their money, and still not even come close to paying for the program for ONE YEAR.<p>At that point, you start having to come down hard on the upper middle class. The top 25% owns roughly 73% of the wealth in the country, or ~$48 trillion. If you tax their NET WORTH at 25%, you could fund the program for a year.<p>Pretty quickly you&#x27;re going to run into a situation where you&#x27;re cutting a check to everyone, then collecting the money (and more) back in taxes. And in this case, it&#x27;s terribly inefficient.<p>On a small scale, a program like this probably works well. On a large scale, it would be a disaster.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_position_of_the_Unite.."" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_position_of_the_Unite...</a>.

If you ran an ecommerce site with known prices for each item, and your only marketing channels were paid and organic search, I could see how this would be possible. But what if your site is for lead gen. How is GA supposed to know the value of a lead, or your company&#x27;s closing rate? For many sites, having a dash widget for ROI would be misinformed.

It seemed like a self-indulgent vanity project. There aren&#x27;t too many legit startups in London, so I didn&#x27;t expect much and teased him mercilessly that he&#x27;d joined a cult.<p>A year or so later, they&#x27;d gotten actual offices and had become something of a phenomenon. People were quitting Google to join them. A pretty famous game developer (creator of Day-Z) was in their office working on his next game. It seemed they&#x27;d managed to reach their ambitious technical goals, which was really, really strange and unexpected, but it still didn&#x27;t click with me that they were doing <i>well</i>, and they were among the most rapidly growing companies in London. I liked the people a lot however, and continued to hang around their offices on Friday just to chat, taking very little interest in their technology.<p>No point to this story, just that spotting a great company can be hard, even when it&#x27;s right under your nose.

I&#x27;m curious what are other people&#x27;s food budgets?<p>In the morning I have some oatmeal with milk. The oatmeal&#x27;s about 20p for a pack and I use about 1/5th of the pack. Milk&#x27;s 50c per liter and I think I use about an 8th or so. I also have a Banana, about 20p. So breakfast is about 30p.<p>Lunch is pretty light, I&#x27;ll go with a pair of sandwiches with peanut butter, and the 2nd piece of fruit, that&#x27;ll cost me probably about 40p or so. Water&#x27;s the drink of choice.<p>70p so far. (this is all Euros btw).<p>Then in the evening it&#x27;ll be two dishes for me, the main dish (carbs, vegs, proteine, very roughly seen) and a small salad.<p>For the main dish: carbs which are always the cheapest. 10 grams of rice costs less than a penny, so an average portion is about 10p. Other carbs like pasta or potatoes are pretty similar in cost. Then there&#x27;s vegetables, can be anything really. Another 100 gram portion of say Broccoli is about 15p, same for alternatives like zucchini or endive. And finally there&#x27;s protein, like fish or chicken. I tend to go 2 times chicken, 1 times beef, 2 times fish, 2 times vegetarian, in a 7 day week. Aiming more of the latter. This&#x27;ll set me back about 60c for meats, a little less for fish unless it&#x27;s salmon. Getting protein from a veg meal is much much cheaper in the form of various beans. My main dinner averages about 65p.<p>In addition there&#x27;s the salad. Bit of cucumber, tomato, lettuce, carrot. It&#x27;s about 50p or so all in all. Then add about 20p for the whole dinner in herbs, onion, garlic, olive oil, vinegar etc. And it&#x27;s about 1.35 for dinner, with 30p breakfast and 40p lunch.<p>So yeah, 2.05 for food in a day. About 1.50 pounds in the UK. Twice what the guy spent, but I consider it a pretty balanced meal, no white loaves or lemonade or tinned anything really. Literally have had a salad for every day of my life for decades now. Never overweight (even during a sedentary lifestyle, working from a home office as a freelancer and not working out at all), yet I eat 3 pretty solid meals, two portions of fruit and two portions of vegetables, enough carbs, not much sugar, decent fats in oils and fish, protein etc.<p>I&#x27;d like to add nuts throughout the day, and eat more vegetables rather than bread for the lunch, and go from 3 days meat to 2 days meat at least, but otherwise I&#x27;m pretty happy with it.<p>Anyway I grew up on this, could easily spend more and I do spend a lot on other stuff, but I keep my main food on a budget for some reason. It really puts everything into perspective, like a $2 bag of chips I can easily power through during a movie, that&#x27;s the entire day&#x27;s food budget equivalent.",1427212096

Many programmers love pairing and immediately get the value, but many others find it exceedingly uncomfortable - so uncomfortable that they aren&#x27;t willing to do it.<p>And on the management side, practices like &quot;The customer is always available&quot; are hard to do in practice, as they challenge organizational boundaries.<p>But without pairing, without a customer rep directly integrated into the team, without TDD, without collective ownership, without sustainable pace - it falls apart very quickly. And what do we get instead? Scrum.

When push comes to shove, it&#x27;s not clear that the EU member states would unanimously act in collective defense. Ultimately, while Europe may be able to collectively defend itself, it is certainly less capable of doing so without the aid of the United States.</i><p>Against what threat, exactly? The big (physical, military) menace at the moment seems to be Russia, and European nations are now running almost continuous military exercises in eastern Europe to train for the possibility that any of those EU states might require protection from Russia aggression over the next few years. I don&#x27;t know which banner they&#x27;re operating under -- I&#x27;m guessing a lot of it is NATO -- but ultimately it&#x27;s still European militaries co-ordinating to put the boots on the ground.<p>That said, realistically, the most effective way to protect ourselves against a belligerent Russia is probably economic anyway. Although some European states are dependent on Russia for energy supplies, that goes both ways, with Russia similarly dependent on Europe for having someone to pay for its natural resources. Neither side could trash that relationship today without suffering severely for it, but in the long run it favours Europe (because energy supplies are generally trending towards nuclear and ideally renewable sources anyway, giving Europe a credible long-term alternative, while Russia has relatively little other than energy exports to support its economy through international trade today).<p><i>Even setting Europe aside, what would you suggest for East Asia? Should Japan be allowed to rearm, potentially disrupting half a century of cordial relations and trade in the region? Should South Korea be left on their own to defend themselves from a North Korean army that outnumbers them two to one?</i><p>If you&#x27;re going to make this kind of argument, you have to consider the effectiveness of armies. Bigger does not necessarily mean more effective if the little guy is better trained and/or has better technology.<p>More generally, I don&#x27;t see why every nation should not be entitled to have a military force sufficient for its self-defence needs. The last world war ended 70 years ago. Concepts like expecting Germany or Japan of 2015 not to maintain effective militaries because of what Germany or Japan did in the 1930s and 1940s are obsolete.<p>In the modern world, I don&#x27;t see why local agreements for mutual benefit could not provide similar assurances of defence and ultimately safer conditions than having the whole world depend on the US as you seem to want. It would take time to make the transition, but it would be better for everyone if that switch did happen over time. IMHO, that includes the US itself.",1427211741

Ruehle was so diligent about getting it right and capturing that home crowd essence, that during a recording session at EA’s sound studio he asked:<p>‘The woman who plays the organ for the Washington Capitals has arthritis; would you like me to play the songs how they are meant to be played, or the way that she plays them because of her condition?’<p>‘Definitely the way she plays it!’ Brook answered, after a laugh.&quot;&quot;&quot;",1427211401

Thus he can offer the current owner more in cash than the owner could ever make renting it. If the owner is a rational actor he will always sell out to the monopolist.<p>In your analogy, the holdout charges $2.50 rent, the monopolist plans to charge $1000. The monopolists borrows 100 years rent and offers it to the holdout who, being rational, sells. The holdout makes more money, the monopolist makes more money.

There are numerous ways of sidestepping it (multiprocessing, pypy, C extensions, etc.), and it does serve a useful purpose.</i><p>That&#x27;s definitely all true, but the article brushes it&#x27;s implications for multithreaded Python off as if they don&#x27;t exist, which is what one of the posters above me was probably referring to.<p>Yes you can do multiprocessing, but if I have lots of shared, volatile state that&#x27;s not what I want. Yes you can use PyPy, but if that doesn&#x27;t work for some python framework I use, or if I can&#x27;t control my deployment environment and it only has CPython I can&#x27;t use PyPy. Obviously you can write C extensions for about any language, using that as an arguments why the GIL is not a problem for multithreaded Python is disingenuous. Maybe I don&#x27;t know or don&#x27;t like to program in C? Green threads are not a substitute for multi-threading either, as they still don&#x27;t allow full utilization of multiple cores and are really only a solution for I/O bound processing.<p>Of the &#x27;numerous ways to sidestep the GIL&#x27; none are satisfactory if you have a CPU bound problem operating on shared state, that lends itself well to parallel execution, which are many. I wouldn&#x27;t use Python to write a video codec or to do DNA sequence processing for example.

Based on data-analysis from your visitors (we ask for a small JS-snippet on each of your pages) we try to predict, by using machine learning, which visitor is sensitive to what kind of messaging at what particular time.<p>Examples:<p>Scarcity: &quot;<i>3 products left in stock</i>&quot;, &quot;<i>order within 2 hours and 13 minutes and we&#x27;ll ship your order today</i>&quot;<p>Social proof: &quot;<i>23 people bought this product today</i>&quot;, &quot;<i>the last order of this product was 3 minutes ago</i>&quot;<p>Authority: &quot;<i>Recommended by institute x</i>&quot;<p>We&#x27;re seeing uplifts in conversions rates from 5% to sometimes 200% (on average 10-15%). Key is timing and finding out what works best for a certain type of visitor. So, for example, shopping at your lunch break often results in a certain behaviour on a shop (ie. going directly or through the shortest route to your desired product) which implicates a sensitivity for a scarcity message. On the other hand, shopping in the evening (more time on your hands) tells us (but not always) that you&#x27;re maybe more inclined to make a good comparison between products. A social proof message helps the most in that case. It&#x27;s a simplified version of the reality but you get the idea :-)<p>The tool is easily integrated in shop software (Magento et al) and usable for the less tech savvy users. The messaging is delivered through non-intrusive pop-ups (maybe you&#x27;ve seen them) and are fully configurable on for example: referer, time of day, position, layout, animation, type of visitor, country, etc etc. We also have an integration with Google Analytics to track performance.<p>You can try us for 30 days free, shoot me an email at bart[at]conversify.com, mention HN, and I&#x27;ll give you 15 extra days for free.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.conversify.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.conversify.com</a>",1427210668

It&#x27;s a phrase very commonly used in international development (economics) to describe the 1 billion people on this planet who live on $1 a day.<p>Why is it disingenuous? Because there is a difference. These 1 billion people actually live on $1 a day. Their food, rent, insurance, water, electricity, education, or lack thereof, is all paid for with $1 per day. 1 billion people actually live on a total budget of $300-400 per year.<p>Elon Musk lived on $1 of food per day as a college student. His ten thousand dollars of annual school tuition for example, was not part of that budget (regardless of whether he or someone else paid for it.) His insurance or rent or clothing or computer or books, etc etc, were not part of that budget.<p>Now obviously Elon didn&#x27;t go out of his way to compare himself to the poorest 1 billion people on the planet, don&#x27;t get me wrong, he never implied that nor intends to convince people of that. Perhaps disingenuous isn&#x27;t quite the right word. Mistaken at least.<p>But I think it&#x27;s important not to use such phrases lightly when 999/1000 times they&#x27;re used in an entirely different manner. Just like saying &quot;I was the victim of discrimination&quot; when your parents gave your brother a new bicycle but not you, is not technically incorrect speech, but definitely not the right way to describe the situation, as the word &#x27;discrimination&#x27; carries a huge load that can&#x27;t just be injected into every casual conversation (safe for a few exceptions like academic speech)<p>In short I hope he and others stop using the phrase &#x27;lived on $1 a day&#x27; unless they actually did.",1427210450

In some languages, what you might think of as &quot;logic errors&quot; can easily be moved to &quot;type errors&quot;.

I assured him I was not going to steal his coat and then he smiled and said &quot;great!&quot;.  :)<p>In the U.S. it seems we use a lot of shortcuts to establish trust quickly. The problem with this approach is that because the cost of trust is so low (say an ad hominem argument or bandwagon bias) it&#x27;s easy to abuse the trust system for personal gain. Given we&#x27;re all about living the &quot;American Dream&quot; of becoming insanely successful ($1B exit anyone?), this frequently puts us in a situation of duality, where we want what we want, but aren&#x27;t willing to put the time and effort into establishing the trust we need to get us there.<p>These are generalizations, of course.",1427210128

So it doesn&#x27;t take much effort (or none at all) to move a project from 3 down to 2 while still in early development if requirements necessitate.<p>[0] One example that comes to mind is a difference in the way str.format() works. In Python 3, strings are unicode text objects, in Py2, they are bytestrings. Some projects used str.format() in Py2  to format binary data rather than text, which breaks when moving to 3. Porting a compatible change to Py3 has been rejected several times because of the complexities in implementation, as well as it being unidiomatic to the language.

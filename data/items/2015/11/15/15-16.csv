You can&#x27;t just say &quot;five apples&quot;. You have to use a counter phrase, which is a concept that I&#x27;ve never seen in any other language (they say Korean and Chinese have the same concept). Essentially a counter is a word you <i>must</i> use. In the apples example, the closest thing to English would be &quot;five pieces of apples&quot;. If you were counting books, you would use a totally different &quot;counter&quot;.<p>On the other hand, learning Japanese has made me realize how absurdly complicated Arabic grammar can be. Every verb/adjective/noun has to be modified to signify gender, singularity-vs-plurality, first-vs-second-vs-third-person, etc. Every verb tense has about 8 to 12 different conjugations, depending on the (implicit) pronoun.<p>Japanese on the other hand, is deceptively simple (and has more ambiguity) in that regard. The concepts of singular and plural forms pretty much don&#x27;t exist. There&#x27;s no definite or indefinite article. The subject is often not mentioned. It&#x27;s as if you refer to all people in third person.<p>The past tense of a verb does not change to signify anything about the subject(s).<p>On the other hand, it can change for a completely different reason: to indicate politeness level.",1447602860

10569872,comment,10567408,10568143,0,0,catnaroek,,,"In general, language design requires a balance between first-class vs. second-class objects. First-class objects are important because they let you write the program you want. Second-class objects are also important because they let you write programs that can be reasoned about.<p>For instance, Haskell&#x27;s type language (without compiler-specific extensions) has no beta reduction, because only type constructors can appear not fully applied in type expressions anyway. This reduces its “raw expressive power” (w.r.t. System F-ω, whose type level is the simply typed lambda calculus), but it makes inference decidable, which helps machines help humans. It also helps humans in a more direct fashion: Haskellers often infer a lot about their programs just from their type signatures, that is, <i>without having to compute at all</i>. It&#x27;s no wonder that Haskellers love reasoning with types - it&#x27;s literally less work than reasoning with values.<p>So I agree with you that “first-class everything” isn&#x27;t a good approach to take. A language with first-class everything is a semantic minefield: Nothing is guaranteed, sometimes not even the runtime system&#x27;s stability. (I&#x27;m looking at you, Lisp!)<p>---<p>But, on the specific topic of first-class functions, you&#x27;ll pry them from my cold dead hands. Solving large problems by composing solutions to smaller, more tractable problems, is a style that&#x27;s greatly facilitated by first-class functions, and I&#x27;m not ready to give it up.",1447602033

Thanks for the link.<p>After browsing that page, I observe that even when Cython is wrapping an external C library, there&#x27;s still a notable difference between the way Cython does things & the way Pymod does things.<p>The explanation on that Cython page begins: &quot;To get started, the first step is to redefine the C API in a .pxd file, say, cqueue.pxd&quot;.  So to wrap an external C library using Cython, you still need to define an entirely new header-like definition file in Cython&#x27;s intermediate language.<p>In contrast, Pymod only requires an `exportpy` pragma annotation at the end of an existing Nim procedure function header -- you don&#x27;t need to create any intermediate definition files.  And the `exportpy` pragma is <i>inert</i> unless you invoke the &quot;pmgen.py&quot; script (a Python script in Pymod that determines the Python C-API system configuration & automates all the compilation), so your Nim code is still completely valid Nim code after you apply the `exportpy` annotation.",1447601658

Something about game worlds ending probably makes it more likely for me to have an existential angst, but the biggest reason is how much Judaeo-Christian RELIGION I have been exposed to and trying to find the truth among contradictory worldviews.<p>I am NOT depressed (at least in the colloquial sense of the term) since I definitely feel intrinsically happy most of the time when nothing special is happening. I don&#x27;t really need anything except good health in order to be happy. However, I tend to take things to their logical conclusion way more than other people, and as a result I see both upsides and downsides most avoid talking about. My mind naturally tries to find the main factors to explain a phenomenon, rather than accepting what&#x27;s told to me.<p>The thought that all this will come to an end is scary to me. It leads to a conclusion which I guess also comes out of depression: what is the point of it all? I can accomplish so much in this world and then if I die and everyone who experiences it will die, what&#x27;s the point ultimately? If you knew the entire world was ending in 3 days due to a meteor, say, would you labor every day on a giant novel, no matter how good it is?

Because while the world will continue, for me it may as well be a fantasy world.<p>Also I look around at the cultures of the earth engaging with computers and cellphones and promiscuous sex and all the other stuff. A lot of it is addictive and exciting, but once you wean yourself off of it you realize how non essential it is. So what is the point of any worldly things?<p>I must say, the fact that religions have existed stably for thousands of years, as well as various philosophies (Buddhism, Stoicism) seem to teach similar things. A detachment from the cares of this world, and a focus on something &quot;greater&quot;.<p>But what if this is all there is?<p>And what if there is an afterlife and we spent our lives believing the wrong religion, and must face some consequences?<p>These are thoughts I find scary.<p>Especially the last one.",1447601236

If it isn't, and the only goal is for it to be acceptable, then it makes more sense to license an existing product.<p>Except for state/government institutions, which very often have many other regulatory hurdles that commercial software doesn't handle well. That's one of the ways in which regulation can be very expensive.",1220817313

It will reduce mortgage rates and reinvigorate the housing market while ultimately reducing our economy's dependence on housing.  In summary, here are the four key parts of the plan:<p>(1) The Treasury purchases Fannie and Freddie preferred stock<p>(2) Treasury purchases Fannie- and Freddie-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities<p>(3) Fannie and Freddie are put into ""conservatorship,"" meaning that the government takes control of their day-to-day operations.  Their common stock dividends are eliminated.<p>(4) Fannie and Freddie can buy modest amounts of MBS in 2009, but ultimately will be forced to reduce the size of their mortgage portfolios.<p>This is all good news.  It will reduce mortgage rates (by providing a backstop buyer for mortgages), yet ultimately reducing our economy's reliance on the housing market and gradually reducing the housing market's reliance on the GSEs.",1220816380

Ever since ""Asteroids"", we've been trained that ""up"" is ""forward"", ""left"" is ""left of forward motion,"" and ""right"" is ""right of forward motion."" From what I can find, the only way to move about is in X,Y mode where up is up, down is down, &c. That's regardless of your current ""direction"". I'd much rather have an asteroids-like motion.<p>Second is that cell and creature stage make a lot of sense. Moving to ""tribal"" stage, things get confusing with not a lot of in-game explanation (and it's a tiny manual). Hopefully that flattens out.",1220814132

She decides to look for dirt on him.\n2. Using XKEYSCORE or another database, she inputs queries to collect his email traffic, and enters his public telephone number for call records. She requests chained results so she can get traffic and call records from his associates as well.\n3. Some results show up in her inbox. Before she can read them, her auditor comes to her desk to ask her why she input a U.S. person&#x27;s name, a likely U.S. person&#x27;s email address, and a U.S. telephone number that hasn&#x27;t been annotated as belonging to a foreigner in her justification (which she left blank). Without any good justification, she is escorted from the building and has her clearance revoked. Game over. She is eaten by a grue.\nShe is lucky she didn&#x27;t target a congressman, because she&#x27;d be in violation of policy that requires all congressman targeting to go through DIRNSA.\nBasically, the only way for this to work would be to get the analyst, auditor, supervisor, and IG to be all radicals in the same political party.

If you&#x27;re going to accuse it of being shoddy, at least take five minutes to read the paper. I&#x27;m not saying you&#x27;re wrong, since I just spent five minutes reading the paper and they do use an modelling tool in the way that you suggest (and also use it to combine multiple reports from over the years or reports with only partial information). It&#x27;s just that it&#x27;s very easy to see something and wisely claim &quot;Oh I bet they&#x27;re making this laughable mistake based off of some vague claim in an article I&#x27;m criticizing&quot; which is kind of harmful. I&#x27;ve said things in the past like &quot;I read a study that X&quot; and immediately the other person was like &quot;Oh but that&#x27;s just correlation&quot;, which is a good thing to think but seriously, it&#x27;s not like the people writing these studies don&#x27;t know that correlation-isn&#x27;t-causation and might have thought to address that. I hadn&#x27;t mentioned any methods used in the study because I didn&#x27;t recall any of them, yet the gross assumption that it was wrong was still lept to. So if communities like Hacker News want to ever believe any science report ever (and they probably do), then I really think people should slow down and at least give the study the benefit of the doubt. You shouldn&#x27;t have to read between the lines - the actual study is free on PLOS. If you don&#x27;t have the time or expertise to read the paper, just pose this complaint as a question instead and probably someone else here will do the work for you.",1383915362

Consumers aren&#x27;t good at this, they aren&#x27;t experts, they don&#x27;t have the right information.  So they turn to regulation (or certification - a voluntary form of regulation).

Going to war is the historical high risk + high reward option: you might be killed, but if you survive, you have a good shot at becoming richer, more powerful, and having offspring (both by becoming a desirable husband/son-in-law, and through the pervasive rapes in which victors indulged after a won battle). Founding a startup is a modern incarnation of that instinct, appealing mostly to the same young males demographic, albeit skewed toward those with very favored socio-economical backgrounds.<p>So, the less hope people have to thrive the &quot;regular&quot; safe way, e.g. because of durable economical crisis and loss of upward social mobility, the more likely they are to respond well to jingoism.<p>As a side-note, polygyny and jingoism are strongly correlated.

You make it sound like Sharon&#x27;s strategy was to find a willing partner to negotiate with to find a &quot;grand bargain&quot;. He wasn&#x27;t. His strategy was to destroy any peace process. Pulling out of Gaza demonstrates that. It was done to completely destroy any need to negotiate with the Palestinians, as described by Dov Weisglass, Ariel Sharon&#x27;s senior advisor in an interview with Ha&#x27;aretz. The following is quoted from here: <a href=""http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/top-pm-aide-gaza-plan-aims-to-freeze-the-peace-process-1.136686"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/top-pm-aide-gaza-p...</a>:<p>&quot;The disengagement is actually formaldehyde,&quot; he said. &quot;It supplies the amount of formaldehyde that is necessary so there will not be a political process with the Palestinians.&quot;<p>Asked why the disengagement plan had been hatched, Weisglass replied: &quot;Because in the fall of 2003 we understood that everything was stuck. And although by the way the Americans read the situation, the blame fell on the Palestinians, not on us, Arik [Sharon] grasped that this state of affairs could not last, that they wouldn&#x27;t leave us alone, wouldn&#x27;t get off our case. Time was not on our side. There was international erosion, internal erosion. Domestically, in the meantime, everything was collapsing. The economy was stagnant, and the Geneva Initiative had gained broad support. And then we were hit with the letters of officers and letters of pilots and letters of commandos [refusing to serve in the territories]. These were not weird kids with green ponytails and a ring in their nose with a strong odor of grass. These were people like Spector&#x27;s group [Yiftah Spector, a renowned Air Force pilot who signed the pilot&#x27;s letter]. Really our finest young people.&quot;<p>Weisglass does not deny that the main achievement of the Gaza plan is the freezing of the peace process in a &quot;legitimate manner.&quot;<p>&quot;That is exactly what happened,&quot; he said. &quot;You know, the term `peace process&#x27; is a bundle of concepts and commitments. The peace process is the establishment of a Palestinian state with all the security risks that entails. The peace process is the evacuation of settlements, it&#x27;s the return of refugees, it&#x27;s the partition of Jerusalem. And all that has now been frozen.... what I effectively agreed to with the Americans was that part of the settlements would not be dealt with at all, and the rest will not be dealt with until the Palestinians turn into Finns. That is the significance of what we did.&quot;<p>* edit: changed wasn&#x27;t to was",1383913987

What was once one of the most horrendous forms of punishment/torture, is now mainstream. Also, this only gives more power to already too powerful of people (you already mentioned the nukes). I think we&#x27;ve already proven we don&#x27;t need mass surveillance to not blow ourselves up.<p>> <i>Another part to this is whether conspiring online actually constitutes a crime.</i><p>&quot;&quot;To be classified as a crime, the act of doing something bad (actus reus) must be usually accompanied by the intention to do something bad (mens rea), with certain exceptions (strict liability).&quot;&quot; - <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime</a><p>In other words, it&#x27;s up to the most powerful, who are also in control of the surveillance to decide this, not us. Also, the &quot;big picture&quot; issues here aren&#x27;t really surveillance itself, but MASS surveillance, SECRET courts, and CLASSIFIED evidence.",1383913071

If you&#x27;d actually read the paper (which it seems few people commenting have done, or maybe you/they don&#x27;t understand), by using DALY&#x27;s (an accepted (by the community) proxy for &#x27;impact&#x27; of a disease), they account for the fact that since people in Western countries get treatment at higher levels, the effects are less. E.g. if I get depressed and get treatment, and work through this in a year, and somebody in Central Africa gets it and lives with it for 15 years, then objectively I am better off and should be counted at 1/15 th in the study (well actually you can debate that - you can say &#x27;I study the amount of people who get depressed&#x27;. Which is fine, but different, and imo not nearly as interesting, except maybe for when you look at the genetic disposition for depression).<p>I don&#x27;t understand why people in this thread are so keen on trying to hold on to the position that depression in the West is high compared to other places, or even how they get to this position in the first place. To me it&#x27;s quite self-evident that living in constant fear of being shot, blown up or just starving to death is more depressing than having to go through the agony of standing in traffic an hour before you can go home and eat a warm meal before falling asleep in front of the tv (to just name an example of what I&#x27;ve heard people as reasons on why life in the West is so &#x27;stressing&#x27; and &#x27;depressing&#x27;).",1383912885

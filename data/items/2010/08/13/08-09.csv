It ""does damage"" because others in the majority accept that it does—for the same reasons that I am ""in debt"" when a number on a machine reads negative. <i>I</i> might agree or disagree with the conception of money as a fiscal instrument, but it is supported by the group in a way that prevents me from participating in the group unless I acknowledge it and treat it the same way that they do. To not acknowledge money (or karma) is, in effect, an act of self-alienation. You ""reject yourself"" from the group by doing it, because the game they are now playing is a competitive one—and if you do not acknowledge the table stakes, you cannot ante.<p>This is why it is important to do some research on social game design (or consult a game designer) before you code a game mechanic into your social webapp. Years of research into MUDs and MMOs show that different mechanics reward, and thus encourage, different types of player-styles, and thus shift the user-base in different directions.<p>Here's the most famous paper on the subject, just to get anyone interested started: <a href=""http://www.mud.co.uk/richard/hcds.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mud.co.uk/richard/hcds.htm</a> .

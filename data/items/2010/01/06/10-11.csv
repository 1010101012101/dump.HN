Could the keyboard perhaps only become operational while the device is expecting text input?<p>Entering text on a 360 with a controller or ATV with the little Apple remote can be pretty glacial! An alternative remote for the ATV could be useful too.",1262775389

1034507,comment,1032298,1034420,0,0,weavejester,,,"I think it's a touch trickier than that. As far as I'm aware, a reload cannot remove namespace mappings; it can just add new ones and overwrite existing ones. So with continual reloads you might find yourself with old deprecated functions cluttering up your namespace.<p>Another problem is that Clojure loads up namespaces sequentially, rather than atomically. So you might end up with an a new version of one function calling the old version of another.<p>In order for your reloading middleware to be robust, I suspect you'd have to (1) wait for any existing request-handling threads to finish, (2) suspend any new request-handling threads, (3) reload your namespaces, (4) resume any suspended request threads.",1262774812

Reading the keyboard directly at the lowest level would probably just make the program bigger<p><i>Clear screen is writing zeros to a known address space</i><p>Generally, another ROM routine call.<p><i>Drawing is writing a 1 to a known address space</i><p>Not really.

1034499,comment,1034174,1034442,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Every product will always have a set of intrinsic features; things like usability, aesthetic appeal, performance, efficiency, robustness, etc. When you use a brain-dead functionality checklist approach to development you are almost assured to fail at delivering on the intrinsic featureset, which is often the most important.<p>In mature industries most of the competition is on these intrinsic aspects, just look at automobiles, furniture, or food.<p>When Apple initially revealed the first iPod in 2001 there was a considerable amount of initial criticism from the tech savvy community and many people thought it would flop. The critics called it just another MP3 player and pointed out where it lacked seemingly important features that the competition already had. And yet the iPod became one of the most phenomenally successful products of all time, and has played a major role in revolutionizing the way that music is produced, distributed, and listened to. All because Apple is smart enough to know how critical it is to deliver on the intrinsic featureset.",1262773868

The oil is not even a factor, and will run out eventually anyway.""<p>If the world were black and white and the only choices were stop buying oil completely or continue the way we currently do things that would be true.  But the world isn't like that.<p>Contrary to what Political Pundits might say our leaders really aren't idiots.  For several decades now we've been pursuing alternate fuel sources (which should start to slowly reduce the amount of oil we purchase) while denouncing foreign oil use (which should subtlety undermine regimes that have no real plan beyond ""make money off oil"").<p>Again history provides the perfect model here.  The U.S. won the cold war not by drastic actions but by slowly undermining the USSR's political system with political rhetoric while doing everything we could to create an economic environment that endorsed the ideals we hoped they would emulate",1262773713

At that time, importing personal computers into Brazil was forbidden, and it took me a couple years to see an Amiga face to face, but from the extensive coverage, I was very impressed. I stuck to my Apple II for a couple more years before, grudgingly, moving to a v20-based PC.<p>I never saw a 1000 in person, but I am the happy owner of a 500, and it's a centerpiece of my ""interesting computer"" collection.<p>I really miss the 80's in that: you could tell different computers apart.

It's not only slow but a single Flash video can bring down all my dozen tabs and while Firefox can restore them, it takes forever to load them in ""parallel"".<p>WebKit is quite crappy and odd, Chromium is still in its infancy but the user experience is an order of magnitude better almost solely because of multiprocessing.<p>It's amazing how a single thing can make so much of the difference merely by coming from the next decade.

Think how very weird you could make any group of people seem to another if you were the only person who could translate between them.<p>These people have no art, but they make impromptu sculptures with moving parts and decorative necklaces.  They have no use for change and reject all things of the outside world, except for clothing, cloth, thread, machetes, movies, and random strangers, including families who hang around for decades trying to learn their language.  They don't point...except maybe with their chins.  Their language is strange and unusual - unless it's in a way that casts doubts on Daniel Everett's understanding, like Keren Everett's claims about prosody.<p>We don't know what these people are saying to Everett, and we have no idea what he's saying to them, due to either deception or a language barrier.

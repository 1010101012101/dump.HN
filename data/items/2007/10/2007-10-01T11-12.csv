In fact, it would be misguided to have imitation of ""real life"" be your guiding principle when designing stuff on the internet. Your ultimate goal, then, would be to create an extra copy of something we already have--the real world--and that's obviously pointless.<p>And nobody ever does that with the Web. What people actually do is create modes of interaction that are deliberately different from and better than real life. Just because you or I can't think of a mode that's as ""rich"" as face-to-face interaction, but is better for whatever purpose, doesn't mean it doesn't exist.",1191237380

Check RHEL 4's release notes (which show how to create a Makefile for a single module).<p>The compile love of Linux novices comes from old documentation from before kernel 2.0, when most drivers started being available as modules.<p>

2429832,comment,2429411,2429780,4,0,emehrkay,,,"When I use jQuery (MooTools is my lib of choice) I find myself using it in ways that is very unlike the majority of jQuery that is seen around the web.<p>I absolutely hate the plugin system simply because you cannot easily get the instance of the plugin an refer to it later. To answer this I use function constructors with the module pattern (its easy and doesnt require an extra lib to get going) to create my plugins. Another thing that I do is when I query for a collection of objects, create an array that represents every item in that collection already wrapped with the jQuery object. This may not seem like a big deal, but there is a difference between<p><pre><code>    var collection = jQuery('a');\n    collection.each(function(i, l){\n        var link = jQuery(l);\n        link.bind('click', function(){//do suff});\n    });\n</code></pre>\nand<p><pre><code>    var collection = jQuery('a'),\n        collected = (function(){\n            var c = [];\n            $.each(collection, function(i, item){\n                c.push(jQuery(item));\n            });\n            return c;\n        })();\n</code></pre>\nthis second way allows you to select an item from collected without having to rewrap it with the jquery object. I dont have any data on it, but it seems like rerunning jQuery() with every mouseover/mouseleave/event etc seems like a waste of processing.<p>Anyway, that is just a few ways that I use jQuery to make javascript a bit easier. These little tricks have the people that I work with thinking that I'm some sort of genius.",1302454386

There is only one reason to proudly put in your attack:<p><pre><code>    Someone that works at X should know better!\n</code></pre>\nWhat reason do you think that is?

Suddenly, his private actions have become publicly tied to our company.<p>There's a reason I don't have my employer in my profile -- I have personally seen someone take a comment the wrong way, and spend days calling the employer to report what a piece of shit the employee is, and how much he was into drugs, and so on. Merely naming the guy's employer here casts them in a bad light.<p>Think back to Noirin Shirley accusing the guy from Twitter of sexual assault via her blog. When the media inevitably ran with it, it wasn't ""an Apache member accuses another Apache member,"" it was ""a Google employee accuses a Twitter employee,"" because that's a much juicier story.

2429795,comment,2428768,2429107,4,0,datasink,,,"When people recommend writing web applications in Python, they don't point to the language itself as being better for web development. They point to Django or web2py. Same for Ruby, with Rails. So it's odd that people talk about PHP itself in these same conversations. You can write web apps without a framework in PHP, but I don't think anyone building non-trivial applications is still doing that.<p>""Tons of problems and weaknesses"" is largely untrue at this point. Many of the problems that were traditionally pointed to were corrected in 5 and 5.3. There is no interest in breaking backwards compatibility, so the built-in function parameter order inconsistencies are still valid. Most frameworks work around this issue with an OOP wrapper for array and string operations.<p>It is difficult to find good dev-power for PHP that's cheap. I've tried. You can find many people who have a basic level of PHP knowledge and refer to web apps as ""scripts"". Finding people who have an understanding of OOP and modern development techniques is much harder and more expensive.<p>Here's why I program web apps in PHP: it works and I know it well. If I need a library for something web related, I can assume it will be available as open-source. I don't have concerns that I can make a PHP application scale if I need to. When features don't make sense to implement in PHP, I'll snap them off and implement them in the most appropriate language in the background. Most of the heavy-lifting for web applications typically happens in the background.",1302453624

2429779,comment,2428746,2429277,1,0,city41,,,"Your argument is mostly that ASP.NET classic and ASP.NET MVC are similar because they come from the same technology stack. The same argument suggests that WinForms and WPF are similar to ASP.NET MVC too. Everyone was surprised by your initial comment because hardly anyone expected anything different from this. Of course ASP.NET MVC uses the CLR, C#, IIS, etc. That's entirely to be expected. It's also a technical detail and doesn't get at the heart of what ASP.NET MVC is really trying to be and the type of development model it is putting forward. Which I would argue is far more important and pertinent than the fact that ASP.NET MVC still uses web.config files.<p>ASP.NET MVC was written to be flexible, testable (this was paramount), and focus on separation of concerns. Even well written classic ASP.NET applications are very difficult to test. To accomplish this MVC was forced to use a lot of interfaces and yes dependency injection. But that's an artifact of the language and again not a surprising fact at all.<p>Ruby is capable of things that C# can only dream of. And when C# 6 or 7 finally make it possible, it will come with awful syntax and more stuff thrown into the kitchen sink language. So yes, Rails can win big things here because of Ruby. ASP.NET MVC can't win big things here because of C#. Although it's not as bad as you make it out to be. But again, no one is surprised by this.<p>Don't forget a major focus of Rails 3 was to decouple things and make them more modular -- Make it easier for developers to choose a data access layer <i>other</i> than ActiveRecord if they wanted to. I'd strongly argue Microsoft looked at Rails 1 and 2 and wisely made the choice to not strongly couple a data access layer into MVC.",1302453043

In the classes where the students actually worked, the common thread I noticed was that the teachers of those classes visibly <i>expected</i> the students to work hard and do their best. And vice versa: the teachers who were the most obsessive about controlling their classes were also the ones who got the least cooperation in this from the students. (I think the causation goes both ways here.)<p>So if I were teaching, say, a math class, and I wanted to use Sal Khan's videos for the lecture content, here's what I would want to do:<p>1. Have less class time. They're watching videos outside of class, so it all balances out, and makes the videos seem like a more legitimate part of the class.<p>2. Let the students know that, if they just cram before tests and don't watch the videos, they'll probably flunk. Contrariwise, if they keep up with the work, they should do just fine, and if they're having trouble, I'm happy to help.<p>3. Keep grading standards high enough that the preceding statement is true.<p>4. Have the first test be difficult but not weighted heavily, as an official kick in the pants to stir laggards from their lethargy.<p>I think this would go a long way toward creating the right mind-set in students, if it's matched with the corresponding respect from the teacher.",1302452802

This may be a necessary feature of any sort of broad curriculum -- people should show competency in areas even if they don't have a particular interest in them. If so, then this does indicate ""a flaw in the idea,"" insofar as the presumed idea will not work across a large spectrum of people and thus may not be implementable at the collegiate level.<p>That said, you could theoretically modify it to have more frequent gradable quizzes on the lectures that people are supposed to watching at home, forcing them to watch them at the assigned times instead of attempting to assimilate the information at the last minute before the test.",1302451581

The downside is that, as you can't create on-the-fly relationships, you need to either store your data in a tree that describes its use, e.g.:<p><pre><code>  blogs/2009/03/05\n</code></pre>\nor you need to add links that point to the same data to create the relationships, e.g.:<p><pre><code>  blogs/2009/03/05 -> stories/a_blog_post\n</code></pre>\nObviously you can add these relationships later in much the same way as you might add indexes to a traditional database.<p>My system also had a notion of arrays.

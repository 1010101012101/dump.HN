9095708,comment,9083207,9086961,0,0,tehchromic,,,"To answer your question, wood is the most natural foundation for honey bees. They generally live in wood, and cutting it does&#x27;t alter it materially. They also live in stone.<p>As organic beekeepers, myself and many others reject the use of wire, plastic, glass, and anything except wood in the hive. Most of the equipment in the modern commercial beekeeping stack, which is also sold to the backyard keeper, is invented to sell you more stuff, and no good for beekeeping.<p>I disagree about the less work and less destructive point, and that&#x27;s the main point I was making. I think this machine will cause more work, in the form of maintenance. I think it will cause you to open your hive more, and will require regular washing and cleaning to work.<p>Lastly, about killing bees and destroying their home, the common Langstroth hive is a pretty poor tool for working with bees and avoiding crushing them. It is heavy and frames are clumsy. However, it is possible to work Lang&#x27;s gently, so that very, very few bees are crushed. That includes comb removal and extraction. An experienced keeper (outside of the commercial industry where automation and machinery crushes bees like nuts), doesn&#x27;t crush many bees.<p>Even better, there are hive designs much older than the Lang, that are even easier to work. I use a design based on a Christ hive, which is light and easy to work. I just never crush bees, even during harvest.<p>So my point is that, while I do think technology and beekeeping go hand in hand, I prefer tech that makes things simpler, rather than more complicated. I think this gadget is a gimmick and would be difficult to use in the real world. That&#x27;s my two cents, as an experienced beekeeper. Cheers!",1424713967

The breakout successes were the 5&#x27;2&quot; guy who made the basketball team, and the chunky musician who never missed a class 6-12. Both were smart, but their drive carried them.)<p>- If you see a partial ethical lapse from someone, the odds are there are more full lapses to follow. Give second chances for a lot of failures, but not ethical lapses.<p>- The group of who you is important to you shrinks, not grows over time.<p>- Somehow you have a lot less free time when you have the so-called &quot;boring, married and 2 kids&quot; life.  It&#x27;s still worth doing.  (Kids are simultaneously much more time than you&#x27;d imagine, much more frustration, and much more awesome)<p>- Be smart about money.  Remember that every dollar of debt needs to be paid back.  Would the future you say, &quot;I really wish I had pissed away X getting...&quot;<p>- Throw out stuff.  You won&#x27;t miss it, and there&#x27;s a cost of carrying it around.  Spend on experience instead.<p>- With alcohol, go for quality over quantity. You&#x27;ll spend less money for a better experience.<p>- It&#x27;s not worth spending time with negative people.<p>- Don&#x27;t wait until you have a daughter to lose the sexism.<p>- Go to the dentist and doctor regularly, and listen to them.<p>- Prepare to reinvent yourself multiple times.<p>- Most of your peer group won&#x27;t achieve the success that they assume will happen naturally.  (Life is a pyramid scheme, and what gets you across the first few steps won&#x27;t get you past the next few, and lots of people drop off along the way)<p>- Luck matters a lot, but operate like it doesn&#x27;t at all.<p>- Be twice as responsible as you think you need to be, because you don&#x27;t know the other person&#x27;s perception.

Many first-time DUI offenders have their licenses suspended but are allowed work privileges to avoid them losing their job.<p>Also, in my state, first-time offenders are often sentenced to either spend three days in jail or take a weekend class, so at least in Ohio, they&#x27;re doing exactly what you&#x27;re mentioning.<p>The only serious issue I see with making DUI laws somewhat more strict is knowing whether or not you&#x27;re too impaired to drive. Groups like Mothers Against Drunk Driving have successfully lobbied to effectively force States to reduce the blood/alcohol threshold that&#x27;s often used to distinguish impairment. I really have no idea how many drinks I can have within a given time frame and still know I&#x27;m legally not considered drunk. I&#x27;ve heard enough instances where people test right at, or slightly below, the threshold and get arrested and they say they felt their driving wasn&#x27;t impaired at all. So I am left with no choice other than to arrange other transportation, or drink what I feel is a limited enough to make me not impaired.",1424712700

Several of the early studies showed no impairment at all, but as driving simulators grew more sophisticated and the tasks became more complex and demanding, impairments were observed, for example in peripheral vision and lane control. Marijuana users, however seem to be aware that their driving skills may be impaired and they tend to compensate by driving more slowly, keeping some distance from the vehicle ahead and in general take fewer risks (Smiley, 1986). This is in marked contrast to the effects of alcohol, which produces clear impairments in many aspects of driving skill as assesed in driving simulators.

Not even most of the people who studied Computer Science know the difference between a function and the graph of a function. So I don&#x27;t see how more difficult concepts can be taught to designers who have no foundation in maths whatsoever. And I don&#x27;t think that high school maths is really enough. You need a solid knowledge of Linear Algebra to understand how to display a 3D object properly.<p>Expressing a design as a mathematical expression that generates new representations that follow some guidelines means the designer needs to rigorously understand the very essence of what it is he&#x27;s trying to do. And then he still needs to know the maths to actually formulate it. This is a tough problem if you start from scratch and I doubt that many designers are really capable of pulling it off.<p>AFAIK creating those layouts for iOS apps has mathematical reasoning. If you design your app, you basically specify rules to anchor each object on the screen. When the app tries to draw its interface, a linear system of equations gets solved and the solution is the best way to put all the objects on the screen, given the rules that were defined. This gives you an extremely powerful design tool to specify your layout for arbitrary screen sizes.<p>I would very much hope that they do the same for CSS any time soon.",1424711440

It also seems like the punishment is often fairly light for the first few offenses (e.g. a small ticket, no penalty points, or similar).<p>People from the US I&#x27;ve spoken to often claim this is because in some areas not having a car is pretty unworkable due to a lack of public transport or alternatives. So if driving was revoked then people could get &quot;stranded&quot; at home (e.g. the nearer store is a 10 minute drive away on roads with no sidewalk).<p>I think if they&#x27;re unwilling to revoke people&#x27;s driving, then waste a bunch of their time. People car much more about their time than their money, just force people to take a full day weekend class even on the first offense and make it three weeks worth or more on the second attempt (you can fine them also).",1424711245

Car makers were perfectly happy with the current situation, and the new-one threatens part of their business model, and nobody likes to switch from a working proven business model to a new-one.<p>However, the difference between car companies and the oil industry is that the latter cannot adapt to this new situation. Car makers could just postpone introducing pure electric cars, or introduce even more complex &#x27;hybrid&#x27; solutions under the pretense of being environmentally-friendly, while selling even more replacement parts and maintenance - which in my opinion was always silly.<p>They could hold the boat off as long as nobody else tried to make a real production-ready electric car. So it&#x27;s no surprise that it was a new-comer to the market that made it first. Suddenly, a lot of car manufacturers jumped the electric train: Renault, Nissan, BMW, Mercedes, ... You really think none of them thought of making an electric car before? GM did, just check out the &quot;who killed the electric car&quot; documentary. I don&#x27;t believe for a second not every single car maker saw what was inevitably coming, but why kill the goose that lays golden eggs? It would be really hard to explain that to shareholders at a time when the industry is going through a very harsh period.",1424711174

It&#x27;s just another open-source project along with the many others we use to keep our networks secure.<p>Also, it&#x27;s designed specifically to do one thing (packet history) and do it well.

So they might find something in the middle of a TCP stream and send an alert, but you don&#x27;t have much context around it.  This allows you to build that context by requesting all packets  from that stream during a (possibly very long) time range.<p>3) There&#x27;s a ton of reasons why this isn&#x27;t used to monitor users:<p>* it&#x27;s wrong:  I&#x27;d flat-out refuse to build something designed to monitor users<p>* it wouldn&#x27;t work #1: most interesting user traffic is encrypted on the wire<p>* it wouldn&#x27;t work #2: our production network architecture is not good at single aggregation points<p>* it wouldn&#x27;t work #3: there aren&#x27;t enough disks in the world to handle our production network load<p>* it&#x27;s redundant:  applications can already do per-application, structured monitoring as necessary for debugging/auditing/etc.",1424711113

The fundamental problem is measurement, which is usually some variant of:<p>""On a scale of 1-10, how happy are you?""<p>I have no clue what the difference between 3, 5 and 7 is. Neither do villagers in New Guinea. So I (and I suspect most people) look around me, assume the typical person is a 5, then rate myself accordingly (I don't have a Wii, therefore I'm a 4). You are really measuring a weird combination of happiness, and what the typical person thinks a ""6 out of 10"" actually means.<p>Basically, most happiness research is BS.",1222519338

It took me a while to figure out I could change it.<p>2) I would like an easy way to load the whole picture in my browser at full resolution so that I can scroll horizontally at will.<p>3) Related, one approach to 2 that I've done on another site is to automatically resize the picture to the maximum height of the user's browser when they go in view full screen mode.",1222517136

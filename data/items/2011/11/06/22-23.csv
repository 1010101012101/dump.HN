3204188,comment,3202081,3202959,1,0,ttcbj,,,"Thanks for this response.  I am currently working at a small company developing a system that will use Mongo.  We originally looked at Mongo and thought we had 'better go with something safe.'  However, the data we are working with varies unpredictably for different customers, and Mongo really helped.  We eventually decided to switch to Mongo, and it has been a great thing for developer productivity.<p>We are hoping to go live with the first version of the system this spring.  It will initially have a small amount of data (less than a hundred MB), will always have a high read to write ratio, and even the read load will be low by most standards for many years (the business provides a large amount of value to a small number of customers, rather than vice versa, thus the low volumes).<p>Anyway, on seeing this thread trending, I thought ""oh, man, are we in for it when we hit production?""  Your response - the openness of it - was reassuring.  We will certainly be counting on not losing data next spring.  We plan to use MongoHQ, and hope their expertise will help us there as well.<p>The development benefits have been so significant that I deeply hope Mongo is focusing on issues like not losing data.  We would hate to have to switch to something less flexible.",1320620372

I am Israeli, I am 22 and I am constantly surprised by two main things:<p>1. How difficult it is<p>2. How the entire Israeli industry has joint efforts to help its young entrepreneurs take their baby steps in this world<p>I'm going to share some of the support I've been receiving, I'd really like to hear what kind of help other startups receive abroad and why.<p>For those of you who don't know, Israel has got a mandatory military service. It means that you only get your first real chance to start your own startup at the age of 21-22. On top of that most Israeli released soldiers take a long trip around the world. So, the image of  21 or 22 year old fellows running around the country, trying to build their business is still considered to be somewhat new. Every week or so Israeli media covers a story about a startup company being sold, raising money or succeeding abroad, so you can really say that startups have become some sort of an Israeli national sport.<p>Ok, having laid the background for why I think that people in Israel enjoy helping young entrepreneurs, I will just give a couple of example:<p>1. People enjoy sharing their connections<p>I was released over a year ago, In that time I had a few month in which I worked as a QA in a High-tech company. At some point I felt the urge to open my startup. I went to my boss and I told him I going to quit. He was very surprised and asked for the reason. When I told him about my need to start my own company and when I shared my idea with him, he summoned a meeting with the CTO (the company wasn't too big). I was sure they were going to try and persuade me to stay. Instead, we set there the three of us, the CTO and my team leader and they both started giving me names and phone numbers of people who might find my product useful. I am still in contact with my ex-CTO. He has bridged some successful connections, including meetings with private investors and angels.<p>2. Successful entrepreneurs enjoy sharing their experience and advice<p>I was at a conference in which the CEO of a successful Israeli startup gave a talk. Then he left time for some questions. I tried asking as many questions as I could, but at some point his time ran short and so the lecture ended. When he went off stage I approached him and ask for some advice. I saw that he was tired, and so I wasn't surprised that he answered in a rather abrupt manner, saying that he is in a hurry. As I turned away, he called towards me and invited me to escort him to his car. It was a rather long conversation, and at its end he gave me  his personal email address.<p>3. Law firms are willing to give you a free of charge bank of hours<p>Well, this is quite self explanatory. 40 hour free bank of hours. Thats nice.<p>4. Celebrities are willing to help you<p>I just emailed a local Israeli rock star. He answered back and we met. he introduced me to some of his friends, and now they too are using our product (it's not that successful for them, need to investigate that).<p>5. Even large companies, such as banks give you a chance<p>Today I went into my online bank account to check my credit status (working on a startup makes this into a necessity, keeping each penny). And there, on the main page of the bank I saw that the bank is running a competition. People need to write up ideas for new ways to use credit cards. If the bank likes your idea you can get up to 100,000 NIS in seed investment (link to competition, https://idea.cal-online.co.il/).<p>Well, there are my impressions until now.

He will only need an RSU grant of ~650 RSUs (which sounds reasonable, especially if it was granted in 2008/2009 when the stock price was lower) to be at $250k total compensation. It could also be the case that his base is higher, but he is only getting 15%-20% bonus, or didn't get as many RSUs: there are many ways in which $250k is a believable figure.<p>Given the near certainty of Facebook's IPOs, what other private companies are trading at on Sharespost and SecondMarket, as well as valuations/prices of recently/upcoming technology IPOs, his total compensation is actually somewhat <i>below</i> what he could earn elsewhere.<p>Of course nobody working at Google (or Facebook, or any other serious technology company for that matter) is it in purely for the money: otherwise they simply wouldn't have be at the level of proficiency needed to be hired at such companies. Taking a route optimized for maximizing _current_ income is not the same as taking a route optimized for learning. _That_ is the reason engineers will always leave Google and join startups (much like Engineers left DEC/Sun/Yahoo/etc... to join Google), provided the startups are solving interesting technical problems. Unfortunately, right now there's a dearth of that.<p>Corollary: you'll never lure a Google-caliber engineer into an actual startup (as opposed to a ""certain pay off"" pre-IPO company) with talk of compensation. When I hear companies complaining about how difficult is it to hire ""because"" of Google/Facebook/Twitter/LinkedIn hiring all the engineers, they're almost always startups that are _not_ building interesting technology.<p>Another relevant point: there is no pressure for a software engineer to live a $250,000 lifestyle. An enterprise sales engineer I know once purchased a used BMW 540i. That seemed pointless to me: you can get better acceleration and handling in in a Japanese car, if really want a BMW you could get a new 3-series (getting better handling and acceleration than a 5-series, along with free maintenance for 50,000 miles). If you don't care for performance, you easily spend 1/3 as much money on a Honda Civic or Accord. However, his explanation made a lot of sense: he frequently needs to take clients out and an executive class car certainly makes an impression that can close a sale. I'd imagine the same goes for lawyers, management consultants and the like. A software engineer can easily live on $40,000 a year and save/invest the rest (for either a startup, early retirement or purchasing what he/she truly dreams of e.g., a Porsche 911 Turbo if they're really into performance cars).",1320618079

It was my understanding that H1Bs were supposed to address talent shortages while still protecting local jobs. If it really had nothing to do with individual performance, was it legal for the company to lay off US citizens while keeping an H1B?<p>I already signed a severance agreement stating that I would not sue the company for any reason; plus, I have no grudge against the guy who was working under H1B, and would feel bad about doing anything to adversely affect him.

But, still, don't assume that the goals of feminism and 'equality' are available for your sister, wife, or daughter.<p>The assumption that women are just like men and can do just what men do except for the most obvious physiological differences just represents a potentially fatal lack of understanding about women.  Sorry 'bout that.<p>In particular, in much of K-12, the girls, especially when the teachers are women, in academic performance commonly knock the socks off the boys.

305273,comment,305199,305199,0,0,petervidani,,,"Thinking Strategically is one of my favorites.  It spends each chapter analyzing techniques of competition, trend, and innovation.  It reads quite easily and offers outside examples ranging from sports, large corporations, and world wars.<p>While you may find it challenging to read straight through, it works well, too, as something to pick up every so often or to read alongside other reading material.  Even for those of you without a peaking interest in business, the advice presented in the book is undeniable logic that will definitely appeal to programmers and entrepreneurs alike.<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Strategically-Competitive-Business-Politics/dp/0393310353"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Strategically-Competitive-Bus...</a>",1221526513

I have some friends in the industry who can't wait to be laid off - even low-ranking positions get 3 months of severance pay from the company (+ more from the state if you don't find a job by then) amounts to a nice vacation if you're smart enough to not be worried about finding a new job.",1221526165
305262,comment,305183,305218,0,0,pierrefar,,,"Thanks for the feedback. I'll definitely look into fixing the design given your comments and the comments elswhere, perhaps using crowdspring as suggested.<p>Not validating is not bad. It's not essential either. Take google.com for example. And the delicious tags are not ""stolen"" but are the delicious.com badge.<p>Closing accounts: didn't think of that, but easy enough to add.<p>Editing and deleting cligs is coming.<p>Skip to content link is for mobile users. A proper mobile-optimized layout is coming that will be automatically used if a mobile UA is detected and this is a temporary measure. As a mobile net user, I find such links very helpful.<p>But I think you're missing something important here. You say ""Right now your solution is not only replicating them on some level, but it does so in an inferior way."" Tinyurl and is.gd do not offer anywhere near the service Cligs does in terms of analytics. I don't want to belittle them but they don't have top contend with user accounts and layout out a ton of data in a sensible way. So the current design of Cligs doesn't work but that's because it needs to do a lot more.<p>Thanks again.",1221526163

305258,comment,305191,305254,0,0,ojbyrne,,,"I like your theory too, though I fear it may be wishful thinking. Those that do continue working are working at lower-paying jobs, and continue drawing down their savings. And if the jobs aren't that much lower status (i.e. McJobs) then they just put more pressure on the income of the generation behind them.<p>But certainly demographics have failed to predict the future in the past, and personally, I'm amazed at what's happened to my income in the past 5 years or so (I'm in my 40s and saving like mad - though all in cash right now).",1221525856

305255,comment,305154,305154,0,0,SirWart,,,"I really like this essay. It almost makes too much sense, like it is too simple an idea to have gone ignored for this long, but the premise is hard to argue with: you can't accurately predict events that happen very rarely (on the time scale that we have accurate measurements for) that have extreme outcomes.<p>Also, reading this reminds me how doomed younoodle.com is.",1221525550
305254,comment,305191,305232,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I like your theory, but I'm not sure it'll stand up to (future) history.  Baby boomers aren't retiring - instead, many plan to work until they drop dead, either because they have no retirement savings (and hence can't withdraw them) or because they have jobs that they enjoy and can remain effective in even until old age.  The latter group of people are most likely to have significant retirement savings, so they may just end up passing their assets to their kids.<p>A lot of predicted demographic time-bombs may not materialize because of this.  The social security crisis may be a nonissue - if every retiree worked just 2-3 years more, social security remains solvent for the forseeable future, and many retirees plan to work more than 2-3 years into retirement age.",1221525359
305253,comment,305183,305193,0,0,ryanmahoski,,,"A URL pointer service with tracking metrics - smart idea, good version 1. I like that the metrics updated immediately after I clicked a link I'd made. The interesting part to me was that it showed relevant Twitter, delicious, etc traffic - for both the cli.gs link and the long URL. Signup was simple and professional. Ignore the people who are expecting a perfect version - you made it clear up front that you're not finished under the hood and haven't applied polish yet. I see you're going to have charts and graphs eventually; nice. I wonder, will you also pull client IP addresses through ip2geo to show maps of visitor traffic? Lots of possible features to add. Congrats on v1 - keep rolling out the reporting tools and polish. If you do, demand for your premium plan should fall into place.",1221525202

305247,comment,304581,305222,0,0,prospero,,,"I think it's unreasonable to expect that even a masterpiece (which Bioshock is not) would appeal to everyone.  Any creative work's impact is measured by its appeal to its core audience, who are often people who live and breath the medium or genre.<p>For instance, one of my favorite movies is <i>Kill!</i> (<a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063186/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063186/</a>), which is a brilliant and quite funny re-imagining of the samurai flick.  It's a pretty good movie in its own right, but what makes it truly masterful is how it subtly twists the norms and tropes of its genre.  These little touches are not aimed at a broad audience, they're aimed at people who are predisposed to like samurai movies, and have already seen a few dozen samurai movies in their life.  That's not cheating, either, it's just knowing your audience and giving them what they want.<p>As to the bad dialogue, voice-acting, etc. I think it's hard to break it down into anything so specific.  A story is good if it allows you to suspend your disbelief.  Bioshock didn't, but it wasn't necessarily because of any of the things you listed; you could just as easily have liked the game in spite of them.  For instance, one of my favorite games of all time is Deus Ex, and it had absolutely laughable voice acting (check out <a href=""http://ispeeeelmydreeenk.ytmnd.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ispeeeelmydreeenk.ytmnd.com/</a>).  Any great creative work is going to be more than the sum of its parts, and just because video games involve computers doesn't mean that they're somehow more quantifiable than painting or poetry.",1221524761

305245,comment,304736,305221,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"If you think your numeric type everywhere may change down the road, you could split out the operation and e.g. define let add = (+) and sub = (-) ... etc. and use those in your code, so you will only need to change them in one place, should you change your numeric type. Abstract out the operation. (Then you're back to using prefix notation.) Or, change it once, and let the compiler show you everywhere else it needs to be fixed.<p>Haskell's type classes are a better overall solution for numeric types, of course. Not having a parallel to Haskell's deriving show in the OCaml standard is also annoying, but it's available elsewhere.

No, if you show revenue, people will ask &quot;how much?&quot; and it will never be enough. The 100x&#x27;er or the 1,000x&#x27;er will now be the 2x dog. But if you have <i>no revenue</i>, then you&#x27;re <i>pre-revenue</i>.<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzAdXyPYKQo"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzAdXyPYKQo</a>",1447023532

If you want to protect rights, it&#x27;s vital to not only have a statute against certain entities violating them (primarily government), but to ensure people cannot sign them away. If something is permitted, it will occur -- there will always be people desperate enough or uninformed enough to agree to anything that&#x27;s permitted for them to agree to, and all of a sudden your rights only exist if you&#x27;re wealthy enough to avoid being forced into a contract like this.<p>In our case it&#x27;s become so ubiquitious that in job offers, not having binding arbitration is a perk -- companies sometimes choose to allow their employees the ability to exercise their rights in order to attract better talent. That&#x27;s not good enough.",1447023507
10530385,comment,10530306,10530306,0,0,api,,,"There are some fantastic counter-arguments in there. For the record I think both sides have valid points: unions <i>do</i> make industries &quot;sclerotic,&quot; but they also exist to prevent a deflationary race to the bottom in wages. I&#x27;d reference Peter Thiel&#x27;s comments on competition from Zero to One-- they apply just as well to labor as they do to companies.<p>&quot;All workers can&#x27;t be paid union wages&quot; is perhaps true, but flattening the labor market completely would result in a squeezing of disposable income that would harm the economy overall not to mention the well being of its participants. As Thiel correctly argues: surpluses are required for pretty much anything outside the status quo to happen. If there are no corporate surpluses there can be no R&D or expansion. If there are no labor surpluses, there can be no adoption of anything new or interesting or novel. How many impoverished check-to-check workers will be purchasing an Oculus Rift or a Tesla?<p>A lot of the criticism of unions is also hypocritical. For example, corporate executives as a class are de-facto unionized. Why is it that companies pay absurd salaries for directors? Being a CEO is a hard job but it&#x27;s not that hard. The reason companies hire superstar directors and pay them superstar wages isn&#x27;t because these people are actually hundreds or thousands of times more effective. It&#x27;s because these people are <i>connected</i>. They&#x27;re plugged into the &quot;old boy network&quot; a.k.a. in the union and that confers a privileged position in relation to things like raising money, making big deals, protecting companies from government scrutiny (the CEOs union has a revolving door with government), etc. A great recent example would be Condi Rice being recruited for the Dropbox board. What expertise does she have in IT enterprise marketing, distributed systems, engineering team building, ...? None. But she&#x27;s very connected in the &quot;union.&quot;<p>I think it&#x27;s reasonable to hypothesize that any time you see what appear to be above-market wages being paid for any form of labor, something union-like is going on even if it&#x27;s not officially organized as such.<p>I also love the comparison of YC to a union. It&#x27;s very much like one.  An open question for pg:<p>Would he be willing to forego YC&#x27;s union-like attributes? This would entail ceasing all collective bargaining with investors on the part of YC companies and refusing to permit companies to openly leverage the YC brand to increase their clout in the market. YC could still provide co-working space and mentorship but could not use any collective marketing, branding, or bargaining strategies to assist its companies in fund raising or growth.<p>Wouldn&#x27;t it be a more efficient market if startups competed only on merit and negotiated in a flat market domain with investors?",1447023500

10530327,comment,10529602,10529602,0,0,6stringmerc,,,"In my view, &quot;binding arbitration&quot; is a very lopsided concept by which a large entity can use an intimidation tactic against a smaller entity or individual at, essentially, a lower cost than going through the US court system. This doesn&#x27;t mean that the large entity is incapable or unwilling to spend capital in defense of a position, but it&#x27;s akin to an &quot;up front&quot; legal investment to save money later. Why bother fighting in court, where an entity like the EFF or ACLU might be willing to provide financial means to support a fight in pursuit of justice, when there&#x27;s an avenue to block such a process from even happening?<p>Thus, I&#x27;ve been happy to have my own &quot;Personal Terms and Conditions&quot; on file (somewhere around here, it was written several years ago) that intends to help tilt the scale back to even. What do I mean? I mean that as a condition of taking my money in Good Faith, whatever business entity I&#x27;m working with will have to abide by my own parameters of negotiation - as in, if I&#x27;m dealing with a large conglomerate, their means are significantly disproportionate to those that I have. So, as a rule of doing business with me, should there be a dispute, the corporate entity agrees to only use the same budget that I have available. It&#x27;s highly subjective whether such things could be defensible in court, but it&#x27;s just one way that I believe it&#x27;s a US Citizen&#x27;s right to declare when there&#x27;s a fight, it&#x27;s going to be as fair as it can be.<p>For example, a friend recently had a dispute with their major healthcare provider over a short vs. long-term prescription issue. The friend&#x27;s Doctor wrote out a 90 day supply prescription for the incurable issue requiring maintenance medication. The insurance company refused to fulfill the 90 day supply, and said that they would only approve a 30 day supply. If you know about US health insurance programs, you&#x27;d know that a 90 day has a copay of $XX, and a 30 day has a copay of $YY. Thus, this person would have to pay nearly 2x in copay monies out of pocket simply because the insurance company didn&#x27;t want to fund the actual, written prescription. Eventually the mail-order fulfillment service started calling up this friend, demanding $X,XXX in back co-pays. The friend pointed out that the fulfillment service had emptied out the Health Savings Account for several years, taking co-pays for each 30 day supply, which was unfair because the actual amount to be billed shouldn&#x27;t exceed the 90 day cost. 5 phone calls later, and with the stubbornness of a ram, the friend finally got the company to give up on trying to extort him for money that wasn&#x27;t owed. To this day, the insurance company refuses to fulfill the 90 day prescription, and he&#x27;s simply waiting, fangs sharp, for if they try to come at him again.<p>How would the above situation work out in arbitration paid-for by the insurance company? They broke the binding agreement of fulfillment, then wanted to make it the responsibility of the party with the least means. That&#x27;s injustice, and it&#x27;s important for individuals to understand, or be willing to stand up and argue, when a large entity decides to &quot;change the rules&quot; to benefit themselves, it&#x27;s fair game to change the rules right back and punch hard. I&#x27;m not presenting this kind of stuff as some kind of quick-fix or blanket approach for each and every person, life is more complex than that. However, the erosion of rights and personal liberty is another complex subject, one that I&#x27;m glad to study for its nuances and application in small and large battles.",1447022749

Their lifestyle tends to rise with income and now they are just getting by with $60,000/year and put themselves in a more fragile place.

Use the other income to invest, save, or fuck around (travel, dinner, etc.). This type of two income house is much less fragile as savings and investments can accumulate, emergencies are easily taken care of, and spending can be reeled in in case of financial heartship.

You would also need to educate yourself on personal finance by reading some other books to get a more holistic picture (The Millionaire Next Door is a good place to start).<p>There&#x27;s three things you need to understand about personal finance:<p>1. The first is that shit happens and most people don&#x27;t plan for it (because they haven&#x27;t been educated on personal finance). Most resources suggest that you keep an emergency fund of 6-12 months of living expenses saved up for when shit happens. We know that most people do not have this. I&#x27;m not even going to bother providing a source because there are so many sources on how Americans don&#x27;t save.<p>2. The number one expense for any given household is going to be housing (whether owned or rented).<p>3. While you can cutback on many things, you cannot cutback on a mortgage. So if there are permanent setbacks to your finances: someone loses their job and gets another one that pays less, someone gets hurt and can&#x27;t work for a while or ends up on disability, someone has to stay home to take care of an unhealthy relative, etc, then you can be pretty much shit out of luck unless you&#x27;re house has equity on it and you can sell and downsize (although most people will just take a loan out against their equity lol).<p>So these are the characters of our stage. If you get a mortgage based on 1 person&#x27;s income and something happens, there is another person there to step up. This provides a powerful safety net for the family. If you get a mortgage based on both people&#x27;s incomes, you are putting yourself at greater risk because if something were to happen to either person you would not be able to afford to keep your 15-30 year agreement. And the cost of getting out of that agreement is enormous (as we saw with the recent housing crash).<p>I encourage you to read more on personal finance. It&#x27;s incredibly fascinating.",1447021571

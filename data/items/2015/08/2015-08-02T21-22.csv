(alleged in the article to be below cost but there wasn&#x27;t really any support for that argument.)<p>Any insights on why companies doing ship breaking wouldn&#x27;t invest at least some of the returns into their own facilities? I could understand if it was a sort of &quot;one and done&quot; thing where you never expected to break a second ship, but since they suggest there is 30 years of experience here, what is the process whereby people don&#x27;t figure out ways to do it better/more efficiently/safer? I would expect that eventually this would be an ideal robotics sort of application (assuming you are ok with a mobile robot carrying around a plasma torch :-)<p>As for China, their behavior has been consistent over the last 50 years at least, which is that acquiring foreign currency reserves are more important than profits. They still import a lot of &quot;stuff&quot; so that is going to be critical to economic growth. There is a long tradition of exporting natural resources to fund those reserves, whether it is Russian&#x27;s oil, or South Africa&#x27;s mineral wealth.

I’ve asked basic questions of both the digital services and the music labels and been stonewalled. For example, I asked YouTube how ad revenue from videos that contain music is shared (which should be an incredibly basic question). They responded that they didn’t share exact numbers, but said that YouTube’s cut was “less than half.”<p>Transparency is the problem not only with music labels. It is also a problem with services like Uber, and with the App Store. The sad thing is: people think they can make a decent amount of money on these services, but that might just turn out to be an expensive mistake on average (there will always be outliers, and those cases will hit the news, but they are not the norm).<p>I think the government should step in and demand complete disclosure on these services.",1438551612

This sort of thing can happen when you pass a function pointer into some sort of callback mechanism+. When you get it back you have to cast it to the right type and then call it.

So instead of generating the salt from the username / etc, you use a random salt and store it.<p>> How does it work?<p>Effectively, by leaking internal state of the cypher / hash through timing variations. The most common ways of doing so are either through data-dependent table lookups or through operations that may be microcoded or otherwise take variable time (multiplications, rotations sometimes, divisions, modulo, squaring).<p>See, for instance, <a href=""http://cr.yp.to/streamciphers/leaks.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cr.yp.to/streamciphers/leaks.html</a> - although note that this is dealing with stream cyphers not hash functions. In particular, the linked paper describes an effective timing attack against AES by taking advantage of processor cache effects on a data-dependent table lookup. I&#x27;d give it a read - it&#x27;s quite interesting.<p>SHA256 is pretty good w.r.t. being close to constant time for a fixed input length. Not perfect, but meh. It uses bitwise xor and and, rotates, shifts, and addition, none of which are generally variable-time (although note that on some platforms rotates <i>are</i> variable-time).<p>For most things, SHA2, by which I mean the newer variants, works reasonably well. In particular, you store SHA2(password xor random_salt xor pepper) and discard the original password. Store the salt in the database with the user, and if you want to get really fancy you embed a single random value (&quot;pepper&quot;) in the application code - this is a kind of last-ditch effort to hopefully prevent user passwords from being leaked even if the database is leaked.<p>If you <i>really</i> want to get fancy, you also embed a couple &quot;canary&quot; accounts (random made-up accounts) in your database, with a passive device on the network that screams bloody murder if any of those accounts ever get successfully logged in to.<p>However, that being said, that doesn&#x27;t really answer your question.<p>A couple things:<p>1) You don&#x27;t want to use SHA, generally. You want to use a proper KDF (key derivation function). Why? Standard hash functions are designed to be fast and not take much memory. Which means it is a whole lot easier to crack.<p>2) If <i>any</i> of the user authentication is in a language that you cannot disable optimizations in, and you cannot look at the assembly code coming out, you <i>cannot</i> prevent timing attacks. You may be able to mitigate them, but that is all.<p>3) In general, if a KDF / hash function doesn&#x27;t use any data-dependent table lookups / pointer chasing / control flow, and doesn&#x27;t do any complex functions (multiplication, etc), it&#x27;s probably relatively safe from timing attacks. Otherwise... Not so much.<p>4) Theoretically, you need cooperation of the kernel, etc, to truly be safe from timing attacks. Among other things, context switches could leak information. In actuality... It&#x27;s definitely possible but I don&#x27;t know of anyone who has made it work.",1438551304

As long as the refugee/immigrant is not there, to get his job* he doesn&#x27;t care. When he finally arrives and takes his job, instead of getting mad to the people who is exploiting the situation, he gets mad to the immigrant who can barely speak the language.<p>I think you dramatically underestimate the place cultural differences are taking in the growing frustration of the people of Europe. Three things:<p>* - Because racial statistics are forbidden in Europe, whenever someone complains that element from a certain group are causing problems their opinion is immediately dismissed as being racist. If you spend even a week in Paris, chances it will be hard for you to stay neutral and support that Muslims/Gipsies aren&#x27;t committing more crimes than any other groups combined.<p>The problem is, people aren&#x27;t oblivious to what happen around them. When some of your relatives/friends gets assaulted in the subway once by someone from north-african ancestry, it is a coincidence. Twice, it was bad luck. Third, something is going on.<p>* - More people complain that they do not want such a steady, and large immigraiton flow. Politicians, because they are either powerless or stubborn ignore the people -> Far right politicians, who have put secure borders and immigration quota at the DNA of their programs are on the rise.<p>Rinse, and repeat.",1438549326

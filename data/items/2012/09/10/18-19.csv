When someone invents something really new, they could keep it a secret and have a monopoly on that product for as long as it takes their competitors to figure out how to do it-- which is often many years.   The patent system gets them to reveal it so that the competitors can start with the state of the art, and then extend it.<p>Google, et. al. want to perverse this system by, instead of extending the state of the art, simply copying the state of the art and then hoping to get away with it in court.  To provide cover they've got legions of people clamoring that ""patents are ""bad"" and stuff like that"".<p>The reality is, getting a patent is not unreasonably difficult.  Thus small startups (like google once was) can patent their technologies (like google once did for page rank) and get protection from major existing players (like google once needed from Yahoo, Inktomi, Alta Vista, Wired Search, etc).... and leverage that protection into investment from Venture Capitalists (like google did.)<p>If you have any question about googles hypocrisy, note that they only say patents are bad when it comes to other people's patents-- they viciously protect PageRank and <i>they sued Apple</i> with motorola patents they acquired for that specific purpose... and are trying to reneg on their agreement to license patents under FRAND terms in order to get leverage to force Apple to license its patents.<p>Patents do empower consumers, when the system works- when companies abide by the rules and use them to get a leg up in advancing technology.<p>We are not all on the same page, though HN may seem like a monoculture because there are a lot of Apple haters here.  But if you look at these discussions you'll notice they are generally uninformed about the history (eg: bringing up Xerox) and don't even know what patents <i>are</i> (eg: confusing design and utility patents, thinking 2001 or Star Trek are ""prior art"" or citing the LG Prada, or claiming Apple is claiming a patent on rounded corners.)<p>One thing you'll never see an anti-IP person do, in my experience, is consider the ramifications of getting rid of all patent laws.<p>For instnace, consider how locked down devices would be when there was no such protection.  Companies would hermetically seal devices to make it difficult for competitors to get inside them to understand how they work-- this would be bad for consumers.<p>Plus progress would be retarded.  Most drugs that have been invented never would have been, and technology progress would be much, much slower.<p>It's popular to hate patents, and that position comes from taking for granted the benefits patents have provided, and focusing on perceived (and hypocritical in my opinion) problems with them.<p>Due to the contentious nature of this position, and the fact that every time I've expressed it on HN, I've been personally attacked, this will be my one comment on this subject, Sorry.

As a designer I know how difficult this is to do without spoiling aesthetics, so good luck (but I think you need to do this).<p>-Host this as a SaaS and make money, I image businesses would love to use this as a way to gather user feedback and talk to users.<p>-Categories would be nice. Right now it's just one ""board"" (in the traditional ""online forum"" sense where the set hierarchy is forum>board>thread>post). I'd find it cool if I could say visit a ""sports"" category, or a ""Tech"" category, and especially a ""Hacker news"" one. Think subreddits.<p>-The ""navigation"" is a little unintuitive, on the left column where it says ""Threads"", ""Lists"", ""Users"". When in threads mode, the other modes are listed underneath it, suggesting that they form a child relationship to Threads, whereas they're really siblings.<p>-I'd dispense with the little arrows under ""Home"" on the left column, and move the refresh button onto the same line as the Create and Home links/buttons. It doesn't really add anything. Up and down could be implemented using infinite scrolling and would be more intuitive. Left and right could be replaced by making aggregating all the different views (""My threads"", ""Users"", ""Replies"", etc.) into a flyout or dropdown list, accessible by hovering the currently active mode title. This would also mean you could dispense with the 3 bottons on the bottom left next to the settings button.<p>-Speaking of that settings button, it doesn't have much to do with searching, instead I'd move it closer  to the ""user button"", which you don't really have but will definitely need. Opening the user pane on the right, and then clicking the username to reveal ""log out"", etc. isn't easy to find.<p>-You probably don't need all the corner hovers, they don't really do anything useful IMHO.<p>-Fluid layout so it works well on mobile devices<p>-The reading mode is cool but you probably don't need it everywhere.<p>Good luck, I love the idea.

This will increase the burden on your nameservers, since records will only be cached that long, but it will make you more nimble as you make substantial changes.<p>2) Migrate your records over to the new provider. This can be a bit tedious for more complex zones, but rather straight-forward for many. Change your nameserver on your local machine to point to your new DNS host, just to test in a ""real-world"" scenario.<p>Then go to your registrar and flip the switch.<p>Switching DNS providers is much less prone to downtime than changing web hosts, since the records themselves aren't changing much -- just where to find them.<p>If you're switching registrars, the principal is similar, setting the TTL quite low during the transition to help you make changes more quickly should something go wrong.",1347301883

It can be interpreted as, ""He does't like organized religion"" or ""Woz has his own religion of sorts, having found inner peace and happiness in his own unique way"". That the evangelist here is a Scientologist (or that there is any evangelist at all) is mostly besides the point.<p>For more perspective, here is the other large passage in which Woz talks about religion:<p>> <i>I had come to learn of Jesus, from my friend Randy Adair in college, that he always tried to find ways toward peace. Although Im not a Christian per se, and dont belong to any religion, what Jesus the historical figure stood for were things I stood for, and those stories Randy told me about him struck a chord with me emotionally. I didnt believe in violence or hurting people. At De Anza, I thought deeply about the war. I considered myself to be athletic and brave. But would I shoot a bullet at another human being? I remember sitting alone at the white Formica table in my bedroom, coming to the conclusion that I could let someone shoot at me, but I couldnt shoot back. I thought, What if Im in Vietnam and Im shooting at some guy? Hes just like me, that guy. He sits down just like I do. He plays cards and he eats pizza, or the equivalent of it, just like normal people I know. He has a family. Why would I want to hurt this person? He might have his reasons for being where he is in the worldand Vietnam had its reasonbut none of these reasons ever touched me in California. From that standpoint, I could see how this war could be a pretty dangerous one for me. Because I was morally and truthfully a conscientious objector in every sense. But the military only counted you as one if you were in a church (which made you exempt from conflict duties), and I had no church. I had no religion. I just had my own logic. So I wasnt a conscientious objector, I just objected to my personally having to kill or hurt anyone.</i><p>Wozniak, Steve (2007-10-17). iWoz: Computer Geek to Cult Icon (pp. 73-74). Norton.

The premise is, it causes harm to children to be involved in highly-charged emotional situations that are at the very least profoundly confusing to them, and at worst cause lasting damage. It has been deemed by legislation and executive order to be worth suppressing the trade, even if only to make it perfectly, publicly clear that it is considered abhorrent.<p>As for harmlessly filming a child remotely, I can think of no greater invasion of privacy. Children cannot conceivably be capable of being said to consent to such activity. The damage may actually be done years later when they inevitably discover the betrayal and indecency they were subjected to.",1347301492

In the past, Apple used Frog design to make a design language for Apple (you see this most notably on the Apple //c and products of that era.)<p>If Apple were mindlessly copying Braun products and selling turntables and radios that looked just like the Braun versions then we'd be saying that's very stupid and unoriginal.<p>But understanding the <i>reason</i> Rahms made certain choices and then applying that set of perspectives and perception of the utility of objects to another context, namely computers and accessories, is a very different thing.<p>Sure the calculator app on the iPhone is a clear homage to Rahms, but this is very different from the iPod which uses the same design language for a completely different product with different needs.<p>I think there might be a level of observation that engineers sometimes don't have, such that they think that ""this just looks good"" and ""You're paying a lot for it being pretty"" (which is funny about products that are actually cheaper, and have been for 1.5 decades.)  This leads to being unable to tell the difference between samsung slavishly copying Apple's look, or HP drawing very heavily from Apple's look to an assumption that its the ""only way this can be engineered.""<p>The reason you think that it is inevitable that products would end up looking like the iPhone is because Apple makes them look inevitable-- eg: they are very well designed.<p>A very well designed item is perfect-- it is the perfect form for its functions.<p>But Apple's competitors are making different products, and if they were competent at design, they would end up looking very different-- are these not differentiated products in terms of function?  Features?  Obviously they are.  But the reason they fail is they then try to slavishly make it look like the Apple product, which undermines the whole point of differentiation in the first place... and also forces the product into a design that was created for a different product.<p>Nothing is inevitable.  Think of the history of mouses and how clunky they were in the 1980s-- and Apple's mice in the 1980s and 1990s had a great deal of human factors engineering and design in them-- they have always been well designed-- were each one of them the ""ultimate"" inevitable design?

4501095,comment,4499762,4499762,18,0,tikhonj,,,"Functional languages may be overrated, but not nearly as overrated as imperative languages (especially Python and Java). At the very least, avoiding Haskell is--unfortunately--quite easy; avoiding Java or Python in most places is nigh impossible.<p>The past post he references can be summarized by its last sentence: ""I seriously don't get it."" It spends quite a bit of effort telling us very little about functional languages but quite a bit about the author. And, as usual, he mistakes difficultly for complexity--just because something is new and mind-bending does not mean it is <i>complex</i>; it could just be a little tricky to pick up. (This is where Rich Hickey's ""Simple Made Easy"" talk really shines.)<p>And, of course, in the current post he misrepresents the main case for functional programming. Which is--quite critically--not concurrency <i>or</i> parallelism! These are, in fact, just nice benefits. The main point is using a higher level of abstraction, reducing coupling, simplifying code, writing <i>less</i> code to do <i>more</i> and making it easy to reason about and verify.<p>If all you care about is concurrency, Haskell is probably not your best bet. But if you care about writing maintainable, reusable and more general code more quickly and without sacrificing too much performance, it is. I would--without thinking twice--use Haskell to write programs in a completely single-threaded world. Haskell may also be good at dealing with concurrent nonsense, but this is really just a symptom of a deeper cause: Haskell is good at dealing with complexity.<p>If that doesn't convince you, Haskell also comes with a ton of shiny toys like QuickCheck and Parsec. It might not have the <i>biggest</i> collection of libraries, but it probably does have one of the most <i>innovative</i>.",1347300091

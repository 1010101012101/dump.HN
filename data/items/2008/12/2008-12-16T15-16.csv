complete top-to-bottom solution.<p>What this would wind up looking like: all employees have company-issued iphones (or iphone-like devices, if more form factors become available), company-issued apple laptops, and there's a couple xserves in a closet somewhere.<p>The xserves give the company integrated calendaring-and-task-management that just works, along with a platform for running whatever internal webapps, file serving, and related tasks.<p>The iphones are smoothly synced up to the company calendar, and possibly are running some in-house applications (eg: for a logistics company, the data-entry software the delivery guys use to note when and where stuff got delivered). Because these iphones are company-issued the company has some backdoors to the iphone's drm layer; this adds a layer of security to the devices in the event that an employee loses the phone and/or attempts to go rogue.<p>The laptops play nice with everything else.<p>Currently you can cobble together an equivalently-functional system with a combination of exchange, blackberries or windows mobile devices, and a lot of custom development and system integration; this is very doable once you're large enough to have a dedicated IT staff, but is often out of reach for small-or-midsize businesses.<p>Apple would like to be able to make this a turnkey system: you pays your money, and get an integrated phone/email/calendaring/collaboration environment; plug it in, set it up, and you're done, and no more sourcing your combined it-and-telecom services from many different vendors.<p>Target customers would include schools, medical and professional offices, and anyplace else where there's a huge gain from more-efficient scheduling and communications but not necessarily a lot of ability to develop in-house grade-A technical staff; fortune-500 types might also benefit, but wouldn't be the direct target.<p>Apple's biggest holdup here is email: they've licensed a lot of what you need to work <i>with</i> exchange, but they don't currently offer any way to <i>run</i> exchange yourself, and they don't have a competing product...ical is nice, but it's not exchange.<p>Until the email-server issue is sorted out, I can't see apple officially trying to enter this market.<p>It's worth noting: even in the event this succeeds, the xserve is never going to make sense as a beige-box replacement; it'd just be a major component of an integrated vertical solution.",1229443193

Well trained armed forces using bow and arrow are extremely effective to the point where untrained forces have little chance of winning.  For a historical example consider what the mongol army did and how long it took.  The reason why insurgency and non traditional warfare has become effective is how little training someone needs to use hit and run tactics and a gun.<p>PS: Picture a tank using a balista and protected by bow and arrow.  It's not rapid fire but without guns / high explosives it's just about as hard to stop.",1229443192

So, I might buy a $1000 computer, thinking that I'll pay it off in on year at %10.<p>If my interest rate suddenly goes up to %29, I'm now paying closer to $1300 for the computer that I was planning on paying $1100 for.<p>And, furthermore, I have little recourse when my interest rates go up.  I say that it's only because of the obscurity of the terms that people put up with this.  If the same thing happened to people's car payments or rent payments, they'd be up in arms.",1229443143

399576,comment,399365,399365,0,0,shimon,,,"I'd really love to see an explanation of the structure of the credit card / payments industry in terms of what roles different corporations play, who are the major players in each role, and how they make money.  I understand there are networks like Visa, which seem to basically administer account number namespaces and perform some role in clearing payments between banks and merchants.  There are also payment processors, who contract with those networks and provide services (card scanners, online payments, etc) to merchants.  And there are lending banks, who pay the merchants (via their processors, I guess) and bill the consumer as they would for any loan.<p>My guess is that at one or more levels of this industry, there is an effective cartel: if you want to offer a credit card that's better for merchants, or consumers, or just run more efficiently, you're unlikely to be able to buy your way in.  It does seem ludicrous that 1% to 3% of your purchases (or, from the merchant's side, revenue) goes somewhere into Visaland instantly; this seems like a massive privatized tax in return for administering an electronic payments system which might not be that difficult to replace today.",1229443062

Because I'm not  unsatisfied with what I'm doing now and because I'm not confident that I would be effective in that field, at least not for a long time.

You're not looking for hard answers in the humanities, while accepting the fact that there's worth in things other than hard answers.<p>History courses can do a lot to improve your ability to recognize patterns in past events or behavior. It also imparts a great deal of knowledge that requires intellectual growth and expansion.<p>Philosophy courses can help you argue a point better, because it's so easy for someone to question your assumptions since everything is so wishy-washy and up in the air and you can't really assume anything. It's really quite frustrating, I can understand how this field feels circuitous and useless.<p>Religious studies help you understand religious people a little better, and see some worth in some forms of religion. Most of all, it will hopefully help you understand your own life better. Most atheists seem to think religious people are categorically stupid, and while there are plenty of stupid religious people around, there are a good deal of pretty wise religious people.<p>Foreign language courses, coupled with some sort of interaction with natives, help you to see the world in other peoples' eyes in a much more direct way than monolingual study.<p>Also, all of these studies can be just plain fun, and tons more fascinating than a CS lecture about problems people have solved ages ago. Not everything has to be strictly utilitarian.<p>I can see how it's really hard to see how humanities advance anything, if you are so short-sighted that material and technological progress is the only measure of human worth. Sometimes it's important for people to be educated in the human condition, both for their worth and for others.",1229442224

Web startups don't need VC in many cases -- they need funding closer to 20,000 than 2,000,000, and that would lower the due diligence somewhat, allowing more deals to be made.  Angels are location-centric, but web startups are happening everywhere.<p>This would change things so that if some web startup only needs 20,000, it's a matter of 200 people around the world who believe in their idea enough to put in $100.

399554,comment,399390,399390,0,0,swombat,,,"1) Awful title. This is not really an article about ""how you are staffing your start-up"", it's an article about ""start-ups should hire more sysadmins"".<p>2) Awful central point (about the sysadmins). Early start-ups are staffed primarily with developers because developers are what start-ups need early on, before the product is launched. Put it this way: if you have a lion running after you to eat you, carrying some extra water and food might be very wise for the later part of your trip, but is completely irrelevant at this point in time, and you're better off throwing it to the ground to run faster. First, you have to escape the lion, or get the start-up off the ground and get users to love it. Until then, every penny spent on ""problems that will hurt you later"" is wasted.<p>Start-ups <i>must</i> be super-optimised in that manner, unless they're floating in an ocean of cash - but that's not the case of most start-ups, and that has other problems.<p>3) More awful points: ""They’ve also given very little thought to how to enable their workforce to communicate"". If your stealth-mode technology start-up needs to give thought to how to enable its workforce to communicate, you're fucked. Pack your bags and do something better with your time, stop wasting your money.<p>4) ""they’ve either assumed that systems folks’ jobs are so easy that it can be handled by the developers"" >> If the 2-3 developers in your pre-launch start-up aren't capable of sorting out their own development environment, you're fucked. See point above. If you've got a lot more than 2-3 at this point in time, you're probably fucked too.<p>5) Hiring someone that specialises in X isn't the only way to do X. Huge fallacy here that because ""start-ups don't hire specialised sysadmins"", therefore ""they don't care about systems administration"". That's utter bullshit. Good start-up developers are generalists and can do anything that needs to be done. Those who can't, aren't good start-up developers.<p>In short, this article is a fantastic example of premature optimisation applied to start-up hiring strategy.",1229441777

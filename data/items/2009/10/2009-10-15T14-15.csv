If you give someone a credit card number, they can just charge you. With a check, they have to ask ME for money, and I decide when or if I'm going to pay.<p>Right, but after you give them the check, it becomes exactly like a credit card. They can charge you at-will. And, just like your credit card, there are stiff penalties for fraud. And just like your credit card, fraud still happens.<p>> 3) Signed, written, record.<p>How is physically stepping into your bank and personally authorizing a transfer of funds any less of a signed record than a check?<p>> 4) NO FEES attached for the vendor. I LOVE getting paid by check because I don't have to give 5-10% away to some bank.<p>Why do you assume that there's a vendor fee here?<p>Personally, if I never saw another paper check that'd be fine. They're nothing but a hassle.  Having a quick and easy ability to accept deposits and authorize transfers without the use of a paper check is such an amazing convenience that I'm shocked we haven't adopted such a system.",1255618798

Chip and Pin was fully implemented in the UK in 2004, we're just getting it here in Canada in late 2009 and it's certainly not implemented well with some places swiping only, some using the chip only and some use the pay-pass system up to $80.<p>Not to mention debit is barely accepted online through the Interac service. Back in the UK debit is accepted everywhere online and when it's not (usually only certain cards, IE non visa/mastercard debits) it's such an annoyance that I've actually called the company and bitched at them (yes I'm talking about you expedia.co.uk).<p>Since I've come to Canada, everyone seems to get paid in checks (archaic), lots of people use checks for transferring money and for payment of large purchases. It just appears as though the country is lazy to adapt, and I'm not even blaming this on the ineptitude of Harper and the previous administrations protecting their monopolies from outside competition and inside advancements.",1255618751

But the author forgots the main reason: There simply is not compelling reason for the majority of people to switch to a Linux desktop.<p>Nearly all the good Open Source desktop apps run under Windows as well. But there are quite a lot of good Windows and Mac apps that won't run under Linux. There's no good replacement and Wine is too complicated to be a feasible solution.<p>Commercial desktop ISVs don't support Linux for 3 simple reasons: (1) There's no standard decentral installer. This is the _most important tool_ for desktop ISVs in their sales funnel and Linux has none (or rather: too many half-finished ones). (2) It's not a single coherent platform but several different ones. And it's not going to change without a decentral installer. (3) It's easier and more profitable to develop web and mobile applications today.<p>There's nothing the Linux community can do about (3). But (1) could be solved and in the long run, also (2). If these two problems for commercial ISVs could be solved, the supply of desktop applications could increase.<p>Then, desktop distribution could also make money by reselling these applications. Then, it would also be rationale to advertise.<p>But that's not going to happen, for one cannot rationally discuss the need of a decentral installer with many Linux users (or Linux distributions).",1255618292

In general there's not much sense in talking about true or accurate prices for some good; price is what it gets, full stop.<p>In the case of most financial products the notion of accurate price is more justified: a product entitles the owner to some sequence of future cash flows, which can be assigned a value in some straightforward manner. When a financial asset's current price deviates from the value of the underlying sequence of payments in some substantial way it's usually due to some easily-understood dynamic (eg: inflation expectations, doubts about some of the payments coming through) which makes a minor correction to the price it fetches.<p>An ""inaccurate price"" would be one with no apparent relation to the underlying cash flows.",1255617733

883428,comment,883120,883120,0,0,senko,,,"This article is symptomatic of people thinking about ""Linux Desktop"" as a concrete thing (or project, or idea), while it isn't. It's an ecosystem of vendors (targeting different markets), projects, technologies, and you can't directly compare it with standalone companies like Microsoft or Apple that (mostly) have a consistent and focused product/marketing strategies.<p>The five ways outlined are:<p>Lack of vendor support - author mentiones SLED, but conveniently skips over the fact that Canonical also provides commercial support for its ""arguably the most popular Linux desktop"" desktop systems.<p>Lack of advertising/marketing - a bunch of video commercials (RH's Truth Happens, Novell's PC/Mac/Linux spoof), Ubuntu's CD shipping program and release jams/parties many of the distroes organise & support is not insignificant; it probably is pocket change to Microsoft's marketing machines, but the entire budgets of these companies are probably a pocket change to Microsoft's marketing machines.<p>Too much bad techie attitude - surprise, someone's a jerk on the internet - you can find l33t people in most online communities. More than average historically in linux communities, but the author does acknowledge there are good sources of online help nowadays (e.g. Ubuntu forums). Esp. the Ubuntu's code of conduct (and similar more or less formal codes in other communities) tries (and IMHO goes a long way to) minimise this problem.<p>Too much infigthing - goes on to recite a recent developer-oriented flamewar and concludes ""no-one outside certain developer circles cares"". So, why does the author care? Open development means not only is the source code open, all the joys and flames related to it are as well.<p>Not enough developer co-operation - again, if you compare the cooperation between different teams in a same company, and between teams in different independent (and possibly competing) companies or projects, the latter will not look as good. I agree with the basic premise, ""not enough developer cooperation"", because we can never have enough of that, but the arguments are just wrong. And, the given example - that fedora and ubuntu have different package systems - has nothing whatsoever to do with developer cooperation.<p>Two positive examples of cooperation:<p>1. KDE and GNOME using (or planning to use) same underlying technology: glib, webkit, telepathy, and the rest of the freedesktop.org stack, and actually co-hosting their main conferences last year.<p>2. All the distros working closely with their upstream projects (e.g. many of debian developers, ubuntu MOTUs and fedora developers actually <i>are</i> the upstream developers too).<p>(Note: I'm biased, as Linux has been my primary desktop for quite some time now and I'm actively involved in GNOME and freedesktop, but I've tried to look at this as impartially as possible. My biggest pet peeve is people really thinking about a ""Linux desktop"" is a single project).",1255617038

Most desktop consumers using Windows and MacOS aren't used to dealing with a product that isn't a household name.<p>While lack of vendor support and advertising (no ""one right way to do things"") appeals to those of us who can invest time learning to maintain our software, people like my parents need someone to call when things go wrong. And it is extremely important that the person they call be courteous and accepting to a fault; my experiences with Dell customer service have been nothing but unhelpful, but none of them have ever chewed me out for failing to read the manual. My experiences with people apparently acting as volunteer service-providers for GNU software online (via IRC) have been both unhelpful and insulting. Perhaps the fault is mine for trying to find help on IRC; sadly, with a lack of a well-advertised vendor offering support, I'm left to scrounge help wherever I can find it.<p>To be fair, it is perhaps reasonable to ask the question of whether people in charge of most Linux distros actually should want to dominate the desktop. But if people do want to create distros that would move in on that space, they should understand that it's exactly these sorts of ""subjective"" assessments of the OS that would block widespread adoption. This isn't a technical problem. It's a sales problem---a problem of not investing as much time and money into the people-to-people interactions as into the people-to-technology interactions.

    TimeT: cover from time_t

I would have expected a closing } in the definition of the TimeT cover.<p>Generally speaking, ooc looks really promising. Compiled to plain C, hence fast and super compatible, and with syntactical treats borrowed from Python and Ruby. I wanted this for a looong time. :-)",1255615266

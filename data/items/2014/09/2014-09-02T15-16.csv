YC is supposed to provide the experience part of the business for these companies, and they are obviously not doing it if there are so many cases like this one.<p>But to be fair, I don&#x27;t think any other accelerator focuses on this part.

We use computer vision at a massive scale, on a large number of rich and ubiquitous video feeds, to understand what is going in in the physical world in real time. We measure how busy places are, what people do, how fast cars go, and much more. We offer that data to developers, citizens, cities, and retailers, radically changing the way they interact with the physical world.<p>We built our platform around privacy. We never store any video and we do not identify people. We also make sure no one can reverse engineer our data to identify anyone. We are backed by top NYC & Silicon Valley VCs, alumna of TechStars (Spring 2013), and actively plugged into their vibrant ecosystem of mentors and alumni.<p>We need creative and flexible minds, with a complete commitment to building nothing else but perfect software and systems. Make a real impact on your city, the NYC tech community, and a fast growing startup. Put your mark on this truly disruptive, slightly crazy, and ambitious platform we are building.<p>Placemeter is in a phase of rapid expansion, and we want you to join us.<p>APPLY NOW: <a href=""https://jobs.lever.co/placemeter?lever-source=hacker-news"" rel=""nofollow"">https://jobs.lever.co/placemeter?lever-source=hacker-news</a>",1409673485

Capital growth refers to the value of the company itself, while cashflow relates to the day-to-day income and expenses needed to run the company.

There are only so many people who will buy your e-book, and there is a very low barrier to entry.<p>On the other hand, a biotech startup has massive potential for capital growth if they found the cure for HIV or something. But until they get FDA approval, they won&#x27;t have much if any income.

And I\ncan say now, that question, those details, and any answer\nall have essentially nothing to do with the axiomatic foundation\nof probability I gave; the answer is the same or essentially\nso independent of those foundations down in the deep sub basement of the subject.<p>Whether something is &quot;only probability&quot; or also &quot;stats&quot;\ncan be important in practice -- e.g., will find\nrelatively little about a lot of important\nwork in statistics in Neveu&#x27;s book on probability.\nAnd there is a lot of practical knowledge in\n<i>applied statistics,</i> e.g., how well\nprinciple components analysis tends to\nwork in practice (quite well).  E.g.,\nthere is a lot in survey and sampling techniques.  \nAnd a lot that is in \n<i>mathematical statistics</i> has yet to have\nbeen derived as fully clean applied mathematics\nfrom only something like Neveu.  Still, basically\n<i>mathematical statistics</i> is <i>applied probability</i>\nwhich in principle can all be done back to\nNeveu and only a little more, e.g., matrix theory, some\ncombinatorics, maybe some group theory for\nbootstrap and resampling plans, etc.<p>Again, my post was on the foundations of\nprobability and showing that there we did not\nneed to mention either frequentism or Bayesianism.\nThat is, maybe my post would be helpful\nfor people struggling with frequentism or\nBayesianism -- I&#x27;m saying, since 1933,\nfor just the foundations, get to\nf&#x27;get about both of them.<p>I studied probability from a star student of\nCinlar at Princeton and from books by\nNeveu, Chung, Breiman, Loeve, and others.\nI did a lot in applied probability and\napplied statistics.  I&#x27;ve published in\nmathematical statistics.\nMy Ph.D. dissertation was in applied\nprobability.  So?  I have\nbackground enough to post.<p>But here I only wanted to\nexplain the foundations of probability\nand not compete with anyone or compare\nmy expertise with anyone.  Instead, I&#x27;m\njust reporting some <i>news</i> current as of\n1933.<p>It does appear to me that now\nfor nearly all serious work in\nprobability and stochastic processes,\nthe Kolmogorov foundations are\nnearly universally accepted; thus,\nreaders are safe in taking seriously\nthe <i>news</i> I reported.<p>Maybe someday I will return to\n<i>pure</i> and applied probability, but for\nnow my interests are in my startup.\nThere, now, mostly the work is in\nsoftware and other parts of business.\nAt the core, my startup is some\nwork in applied probability, but I did\nthat months ago and long since\nhave had the corresponding computations\nin solid software.\nSo, for now, more background in\nprobability is not on my TODO list.<p>Again, here I&#x27;m just giving some\nHN readers the news that as of\n1933 get to f&#x27;get about the\nfrequentism and Bayesianism <i>foundations</i>\nof probability.",1409672998

Yes, these medications &quot;have reported only modest benefits over placebo treatment&quot;, but the measured benefit of placebo treatment in this case is quite large and the medications work BETTER than placebo.<p>Yes, unless unpublished studies are included in the analysis, after which the effect falls below that required to make a claim of clinical effectiveness. That distinction is perfectly clear in the post to which you replied.<p>> As for the claim that the difference falls below accepted criteria for clinical significance, the &quot;accepted criteria&quot; used to reach that conclusion are pretty arbitrary and it only just BARELY falls below the arbitrary level picked (by some), depending on which studies are included.<p>Weasel words, words that a scientist wouldn&#x27;t dream of including in a study means to generate light, not heat.

I&#x27;m telling the machine what to do, and it&#x27;s doing it right away. Wow.<p>There was no barrier to entry. And despite valiant efforts these days, it was so much better than the modern &quot;making programming accessible&quot; ideas. I didn&#x27;t have to install anything. Every C64 I would encounter had this functionality. It didn&#x27;t feel like a dumbed down second-class-citizen environment. This was how you interacted with the machine.<p>I think that main-streaming of general purpose computers has killed this.

It would make listening to music, watching videos, checking my bank balance or accessing my virtual machines for work.<p>I don&#x27;t have separate media devices.

Outside of industrial and scientific applications, most computing devices try to be a jack of all trades, being everything to everyone, and doing poorly at it.

What I mean is that having AST is meaningless by itself, but you need AST if you want to generate UML diagram from the code. Or generate a callgraph. Or find similarities or duplication in the code. Or indeed perform any kind of automatic code transformation.<p>So extracting AST is a first step to developing your own tools for working with a codebase. And with a codebase of this size you just have to write your own tools, adapted to the nature of this particular codebase.

Moving files around on the PS command line is much more efficient than using Explorer, just like bash/Terminal on the Ubuntu desktop.

Even command line switches tab complete, just type a hyphen and then you can tab-cycle through every command line switch that particular cmdlet supports. There&#x27;s also Remote Powershell, which is like SSH but also built-in. I can sit in a Powershell window and connect to a Windows server anywhere just like SSH on Linux, or even compose a script block, assign it to a variable, then send it over the wire to be executed remotely (or to a group of machines in a foreach loop). It&#x27;s pretty slick, and all this is built into the shell--no third-party tools required.<p>I&#x27;m not a big fan of MS, but I&#x27;m willing to give them kudos on the rare occasion that they build something nice.

I took a Comfort Taxi to the conference (booked via app, taxi arrival 3-4 mins, took me straight to the right hall of the conference center in 20 mins. Cost about 18SGD) and then took Uber back to downtown. Uber ended up costing me over 70 SGD (i.e. even with the 50SGD coupon it was more expensive than the taxi). I had to wait 15 mins for it to show up (the app showed 5 mins away, but the driver drove in circles and couldn&#x27;t find my location even with GPS, driver barely spoke English, driver didn&#x27;t know one of the main streets downtown that I was going to, so I had to direct him). You can book taxis via phone, SMS, web or app. They are cheaper than Uber. Taxis are clean, regulated, always use meters, accept NETS and Credit Cards and if you want a nicer one you can get a Chrysler or Daimler for a little extra fee.

So, don&#x27;t listen to me.<p>As I get it, you probably want to let users start for free when their requirements are small, and start changing as they grow. I suppose everyone has different needs, though — some value ability to spawn a dozens of tiny private repos, but some want just one for a relatively large team.<p>Then — just a wild idea — maybe assign some value for resources and services you provide and give a quota of what&#x27;s free? Say, maybe, the formula could be repository count multiplied by collaborator count, so mediocre usage will stay under the threshold, raising either repo count or collaborator number alone (possibly, until the number is sufficiently large) still wouldn&#x27;t be enough to leave the free tier, but raising both would nearly instantly require paying for your services. Something along those lines.<p>This probably could be confusing to customers (although some flexible cloud providers seem to deal with it with those fancy price calculators page with resource sliders), but maybe you&#x27;ll think something. Or not.<p>And it certainly depends whenever your customers actually want such flexibility and there&#x27;s enough diversity of use cases among them. Maybe they don&#x27;t care and everything fits into something simpler.

If you&#x27;re just going to strawman my arguments here then, fuck it, I don&#x27;t want to talk to you. Like I said, it&#x27;s circumstantial evidence, since their cooperation would have come after the Snowden documents were released, but it&#x27;s still evidence. We know they&#x27;re being targeted, they have people on their board who love this shit, and their silence - in stark contrast to most other PRISM targets - is deafening. Again, this isn&#x27;t a court of law, the burden of proof is lower, and if you&#x27;re not open about what you&#x27;re doing, then it isn&#x27;t unreasonable to assume you&#x27;re in bed with the bad guys.<p>This isn&#x27;t birther or truther or whatever else, conspiracy theory territory. I&#x27;m not making any leaps of tortured logic here, so don&#x27;t paint me with the same brush. It&#x27;s pretty straightforward and at any rate, all I said initially is that they hand over data to the US government. You appear to agree with me on this after all, you&#x27;re just giving them more benefit of the doubt with regard to their level of cooperation.<p>Just to be clear, let&#x27;s draw a distinction between mere <i>complying</i> with NSLs to the extent required by the law, and cooperating with the NSA on these illegal spying programs. They are not the same thing, and Dropbox is likely doing the latter. Yes, they certainly receive NSLs like anyone else, and some level of cooperation is required by law, but they are also likely to be designing their systems with ease of access for the NSA in mind. It is not unreasonable to think the NSA has automatic access to their data. Other PRISM targets have been pretty open (at least in comparison to Dropbox) about what their cooperation entails, what they are required to do, and what steps they take to safeguard their data. Dropbox has been utterly silent, and that&#x27;s the most damning thing. Perhaps this would not be a fair conclusion to draw, had they not made the utterly stupid and incomprehensible decision to allow Condoleezza Rice to join their board of directors, but they did, and it is.<p>No, you are foolish if you think Dropbox is not giving their customer data to the NSA. That&#x27;s nothing but wishful thinking. Absolutely foolish and naive. Much more so than if, in 2012, you thought the NSA wasn&#x27;t snooping on emails, et cetera. At least back then the scale of what they are up to would have been something of an extraordinary claim - that&#x27;s not the case anymore.",1409671671

It is surprising that there is no usable solution to this issue without resorting to what seem like pretty awful methods. If I am wrong about this please do let me know.<p>Based on what I found today, there are a couple of ways to handle the problem of variable sized images. If anyone knows others please do tell.<p>1. Use picture and srcset with a polyfill (Picturefill). With this you end up with verbose markup as well as needing stuff like &quot;<!--[if IE 9]><video style=&quot;display: none;&quot;><![endif]-->&quot; to make it work. It also results in requests to multiple images for browsers that support srcset but not picture, meaning twice as many images are downloaded. Many browsers are in this group with the current or next versions.<p>2. Use javascript. This is the method employed by various saas solutions that I looked at, and there are of course libraries that you can use yourself. Waiting for javascript to execute before the images can start being pulled down has obvious problems.<p>3. User agent sniffing. This method requires server side logic to implement, and relies on data that in many cases will not result in an appropriately sized image being rendered.<p>Is there another way? Has anyone got a workable solution to this and could give a recommendation?",1409671148

Current sandboxing mechanisms on Linux (such as Chrome&#x27;s various sandboxes) use seccomp to restrict almost all syscalls, and their APIs come from IPC to more privileged processes.<p>Two notable differences:<p>On the one hand, seccomp provides much more flexibility about the subset of kernel API offered to the process, rather than just saying &quot;here&#x27;s 45 syscalls&quot;.<p>On the other hand, Drawbridge claims to run unmodified Windows applications; they may have an efficient mechanism for trapping NT &quot;syscalls&quot; and redirecting them to their &quot;user-mode NT kernel&quot; ntoskrnl.dll.  However, this might just mean that they run unmodified applications making Win32 library calls, and the libraries have been modified, in which case programs making NT kernel syscalls would not run unmodified.<p>I&#x27;d really like to see a standard mechanism on Linux, similar to the &quot;personality&quot; mechanism, that augments seccomp with an efficient process for defining a new &quot;syscall&quot; layer.

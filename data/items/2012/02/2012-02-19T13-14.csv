Each snippet is stored under and accessed by a key that uniquely identifies the version saved (object type + ID + update timestamp). When a new version is cached, the old version stays in the cache, unused, until it is eventially dropped out by Memcached.<p>Now all you need to do is to ensure that whenever an object or its children change, you update their timestamp (the ""touch"" part), and if you make a changes to the code, you increment the version key for said cache piece. This way new requests will not hit old cached content.",1329659887

And even if you haven't committed a crime, enough circumstantial ""evidence"" might be put together to convince a jury that you had.<p>Back in the 1970's, Justice Douglass dissented in California Bankers Association v. Shultz, saying that if the government found financial transactions helpful in monitoring crime, why stop there?  Why not require all book purchases, library records, and drugstore purchases as well?  Douglass painted a dystopian view of what the nation would be like with these areas of data available to the government and not protected for the consumer.  Little did he know that thirty years later we'd have the USAPATRIOT act, bringing us fairly close to exactly what he argued against.<p>I would argue that statutory protections are not enough.  We need Constitutional protections at least in the US as well.  Sotomayor argues for this in her concurrence in Jones, and also suggests that we have to think about 4th amendment law in a new way, bringing us in many ways back to Douglass's dissent.  There is hope.",1329657346

For example, people charged with terrorism acts nowadays are found mainly in extremist religious circles and extremist right wing anti-government circles. (In the 1960s/1970s it would be extremist left-youth and extremist black-emancipation circles) The background of people in prison is often a weak economical-social position coupled with bad childhood experiences or psychological problems. If you do not grow up in these social circles (or you've been out of them for a long time) you just won't interact with people in prison or that are charged as terrorist.<p>That does not mean that these reports aren't exaggerated -- I often wonder about the agenda of these journalists/news outlets--, but it does neither mean you're anecdotal experience is un-biased in measuring the situation.",1329657046

After all, what you get is a series of hypotheticals and asked what the right thing to do is and why.  The hypotheticals are written so it's obvious what the teacher wants.  So the goal is to justify the ""right"" answer.<p>What my friend has argued instead is that the question you are asking, namely how do you evaluate a system?  Is it one that encourages the cream to rise, or one where shit floats?  To me that's the biggest question.<p>If you have a business model where the unethical individuals rise to the top (and if they are up at the top that's a pretty good bet) then that's a bad system.  If you have one that encourages the ethical folks to rise to the top, then you have a good system.<p>Now what would I do?<p>I have worked on projects that others found unethical that I did not, for example, an accounting system for a porn payment gateway.  I knew others on the project who did have ethical problems with it.  However, the people that ran my customer's business were great--- professional and ethical in terms of running a business.<p>Similarly I had no problem writing documentation for Microsoft regarding interop of Linux and Windows, even though I was helping Microsoft with Windows marketing and I favor Linux for both ethical and more practical reasons.  Whatever helps the customer run a mixed environment is ultimately a good thing.<p>On the other hand, there are plenty of projects I wouldn't do even if they seem viable.  I don't think Monsanto could pay me enough to do anything for them, for example.<p>As for a next-gen pay-day-loan startup?  I would want to have a serious talk with the founders and see if I was missing something.  Maybe they have a clear idea on how to make it ethical?  Also if I met the founders I might have a better idea if they were being predatory or rather trying to bring a better way for everyone into the industry.<p>For international arms transactions?  Hmmm.... given that countries usually buy arms from other countries, that would mostly be to facilitate organized crime.  No thank you.<p>If it's a gray area, you sit down and try to get a better sense of things.  It is possible for a project to be ethical in a sea of poor ethics.  If it is unambiguously unethical, I would not touch it.  But if the people running it are clearly ethically impaired, then run like hell.<p>I don't want to be Zinga'd.  No thx.... ;-)",1329656868

3609244,comment,3606892,3609219,1,0,drostie,,,"There is another factor, too: we as coders are principally biased to work on projects which are <i>fun</i>, and that can supersaturate this market. So I just spent a couple days working on a project to embed a couple of lisp-like structures in JavaScript for building up properly-indented HTML templates. The idea came from seeing people who were successful at using the C preprocessor to create templating schemes. I might port the code to a language that I'm less familiar with, like Clojure, just to get a feel for that language, but I wanted the core structure to exist in a context that I was already comfortable with and could debug. (Really that's half the reason why I use Node.js -- back in the IE versus Netscape days, JavaScript was my second real programming language and it always has the benefits of comfort, even as I learn more Lisp and Ruby.)<p>Anyway, this happens to be useful for me, because it lets me define macros which I can use to build up XML trees. But now if we come to the question: could I sell it for a profit? -- then the answer is ""no, because it was too fun to build."" Don't get me wrong, it will save me a bit of time (and it might save others a bit of time) to be able to separate my template-development language from HTML -- but I fully expect that a programmer at the startup of your choice who needs it will also say, ""this looks like a fun two-day project, let me see what I can do.""",1329656434

For example, spitting on the sidewalk is a violation in NYC, but the NYPD isn&#x27;t issuing thousands of summonses. It doesn&#x27;t make any point re: the police and race.<p>This guy is a professional agitator. He didn&#x27;t get arrested for carrying graffiti tools, so he tagged city hall. The officer present decided to not deal with a political speech issue and moved along. Then he decided to be a smart ass and annoy people who have the power and broad discretion to apply the letter of the law upon him. When you do that, you tend to attract harsh treatment.<p>The second part isn&#x27;t a problem <i>per se</i> -- the District Attorney&#x27;s office and Probation Department are legally invested to use their own discretion. I suppose that if he built a rapport with the PO and had his requests granted, that he would be complaining that he received favorable treatment for being white.",1387313865
6923908,comment,6921092,6921523,1,0,sturgill,,,"There is no inherent morality attached to paying taxes. And there is no inherent morality that dictates what amount of tax one should pay.  There is a legal obligation to pay taxes, and a moral obligation to follow the law, but there is not a moral obligation to pay more in taxes than what the State requires.<p>Put another way: there is an intrinsic moral responsibility to not murder, but there is not an intrinsic moral responsibility to pay taxes.  One could imagine a country in which there were no taxes, and such a state would not be immoral.  And those who lived there and did not pay taxes would not be viewed as immoral.  But if this same country did not have an explicit statute outlawing murder, we would still call people who murdered others (e.g., killed for pleasure) immoral.<p>Given that we are morally obligated to pay taxes strictly on the virtue that a law exists that says &quot;You must pay this tax&quot;, how is it morally problematic to determine what you owe under the legal structure that has imposed the tax?  Your moral obligation is to pay the tax as it is defined, it is not your moral obligation to pay more tax than the tax code requires.<p>That seems to me to be an obvious tautology: you owe in taxes what the tax code says you owe.  If the tax code allows you to limit your tax responsibility by moving money through trusts, so be it.  It doesn&#x27;t seem any different than parts of the tax code that limit your tax responsibility for buying a home, having kids, or making under a certain threshold of money.<p>Whether or not the tax code, as constituted, is fair, equitable, desirable, or is having its intended effect are fair questions.  But calling people immoral because they find legally sanctioned ways to reduce their tax liabilities is troubling.<p>I don&#x27;t make enough to really worry about these structures, but I can guarantee you that if I did I would do whatever I could to reduce my legal tax responsibility.",1387313848

I&#x27;m sure the local police have methlabs to worry about, but sure, arrest them too if they ride on the street or trespass.<p>I am not saying that a racial discrepancy in enforcement is acceptable.

6923856,comment,6922153,6923782,7,0,beat,,,"At least according to author Matthew B. Crawford, Henry Ford did not raise wages out of the goodness of his heart, so his workers could afford to buy cars themselves.<p>From his original <i>Shop Class as Soulcraft</i> essay:\n<a href=\"http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/shop-class-as-soulcraft\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/shop-class-as-sou...</a>\n<i>&quot;Given their likely acquaintance with such a cognitively rich world of work, it is hardly surprising that when Henry Ford introduced the assembly line in 1913, workers simply walked out. One of Ford’s biographers wrote, “So great was labor’s distaste for the new machine system that toward the close of 1913 every time the company wanted to add 100 men to its factory personnel, it was necessary to hire 963.”<p>This would seem to be a crucial moment in the history of political economy. Evidently, the new system provoked natural revulsion. Yet, at some point, workers became habituated to it. How did this happen? One might be tempted to inquire in a typological mode: What sort of men were these first, the 100 out of 963 who stuck it out on the new assembly line? Perhaps it was the men who felt less revulsion because they had less pride in their own powers, and were therefore more tractable. Less republican, we might say. But if there was initially such a self-selection process, it quickly gave way to something less deliberate, more systemic.<p>In a temporary suspension of the Taylorist logic, Ford was forced to double the daily wage of his workers to keep the line staffed. As Braverman writes, this “opened up new possibilities for the intensification of labor within the plants, where workers were now anxious to keep their jobs.” These anxious workers were more productive. Indeed, Ford himself later recognized his wage increase as “one of the finest cost-cutting moves we ever made,” as he was able to double, and then triple, the rate at which cars were assembled by simply speeding up the conveyors. By doing so he destroyed his competitors, and thereby destroyed the possibility of an alternative way of working. (It also removed the wage pressure that comes from the existence of more enjoyable jobs.) At the Columbian World Expo held in Chicago in 1893, no fewer than seven large-scale carriage builders from Cincinnati alone presented their wares. Adopting Ford’s methods, the industry would soon be reduced to the Big Three. So workers eventually became habituated to the abstraction of the assembly line. Evidently, it inspires revulsion only if one is acquainted with more satisfying modes of work.&quot;</i><p>I think every worker in America should read Crawford&#x27;s superb book, btw.",1387313442

I also showed you how to do it with promises already (in 1 line) so not sure why you are wishing me good luck :)<p>There is just no way to use yield without it either being superfluous or sacrificing concurrency. Of course it is great when you have a sequence I guess, but promise code with arrows is not messy in comparison, maybe slightly more verbose at best.<p>Consider something like this which is far from optimal:<p><pre><code>    let suspend = require(&#x27;suspend&#x27;),\n        request = require(&#x27;request&#x27;);\n\n    let getParsed = suspend(function* (urls) {\n        urls.forEach((url) => request(url, suspend.fork()));\n        return (yield suspend.join()).map((r) => parseBody(r.body));\n    });\n</code></pre>\nThis is again very easy to write inadvertently.<p>Maximizing concurrency:<p><pre><code>    let getParsed = Promise.coroutine(function* (urls) {\n        return yield urls.map((url) => {\n            request(url).spread((response, body) => parseBody(body));\n        });\n    });\n</code></pre>\nHowever, now that we have maximum concurrency, it is entirely pointless to even have a generator:<p><pre><code>    let getParsed = urls =>\n        urls.map((url) => {\n            request(url).spread((response, body) => parseBody(body));\n        });\n    });\n</code></pre>\nI said try-catch silences all errors that are not event meant to be handled but are bugs in code that should never be thrown in the first place. For example, if you have a typo in your code you will not know about that instead you will handle it like an expected error like network error.<p>Since promise `.catch()` is not limited by the language, you can do e.g.  `.catch(NetworkError, e => ());` or whatever.",1387313287

A Cleveland, Ohio newspaper editorialized that the announcement &quot;shot like a blinding rocket through the dark clouds of the present industrial depression.&quot; The move proved extremely profitable; instead of constant turnover of employees, the best mechanics in Detroit flocked to Ford, bringing their human capital and expertise, raising productivity, and lowering training costs. Ford announced his $5-per-day program on January 5, 1914, raising the minimum daily pay from $2.34 to $5 for qualifying workers. It also set a new, reduced workweek, although the details vary in different accounts. Ford and Crowther in 1922 described it as six 8-hour days, giving a 48-hour week, while in 1926 they described it as five 8-hour days, giving a 40-hour week. (Apparently the program started with Saturday being a workday and sometime later it was changed to a day off.)<p>> Detroit was already a high-wage city, but competitors were forced to raise wages or lose their best workers. Ford&#x27;s policy proved, however, that paying people more would enable Ford workers to afford the cars they were producing and be good for the economy. Ford explained the policy as profit-sharing rather than wages. It may have been Couzens who convinced Ford to adopt the $5 day.",1387312739

It&#x27;s like eating sugar.<p>There&#x27;s a repetition, a shallowness, a formulaic manipulation to evoke an emotional response, a smugness to the presenters, a greater smugness to the privileged attendees sitting there in the audience, grinning vacantly.<p>They trot an African kid out on stage who built something out of recycled parts, and everybody instantly connects to him, understands the plights of his existence, and shares in the celebration of his achievement. Then they drive back in their expensive cars to their expensive houses in the privileged  enclaves of Los Angeles or San Francisco or wherever. They did their part.<p>I&#x27;m glad somebody&#x27;s discussing it, but this talk is in many ways yet another TED talk. Identify a complex problem that can&#x27;t possibly be tackled within the confines of the TED format; say non-controversial things as if they were controversial; name drop big issues (the negative aspects of drone warfare, consumer capitalism, NSA spying); provide a rushed, hand-wavey solution without an implementation; but leave the audience feeling like the veil has finally been lifted on this issue, and <i>now</i> they&#x27;re on the precipice of positive change.",1387312112

In my case, photo backups from my phone to my laptop, which happens via PhotoStream at the moment, or files from my laptop to my phone. If a route can easily be formed across the nearest AP then it&#x27;s shorter, more stable, probably higher bandwidth and certainly lower latency than via the cloud.  As the number of devices I own grows, this use case will become more prevalent (think &quot;Internet of Things&quot;).<p><i>&quot;You have to do a lot more work to achieve things that would otherwise be simple and straightforward&quot;</i>: Sure, but you haven&#x27;t asked <i>why</i> this is the case (and who &#x27;you&#x27; is), which is just as important to examine. At the moment, you <i>as a developer</i> have to do more work in order to build decentralised systems because not enough <i>free OSS tools exist yet</i>.  The main reason that using a central server is easier is because the tools, techniques and knowledgebase have become &#x27;standardised&#x27; but that doesn&#x27;t preclude there being <i>better</i> ways of doing things.  I&#x27;m advocating tools that make it easier to build decentralised services and products.<p>Decentralised systems are more resilient than their centralised counterparts. Any large-scale service/product ends up being decentralised behind the scenes and if you don&#x27;t believe me, ponder for a moment how the likes of Google, Facebook et. al., manage to deal with so many users across the globe.  They <i>have</i> to make their own tools to solve the same kinds of problems I&#x27;m alluding to. I&#x27;m merely advocating that we try to &#x27;productize&#x27; such tools so that any developer can pick them up and incorporate them from the very beginning.  Real world examples of such things are how Skype worked in the early days, Dropbox&#x27;s LAN sync [1] and even Spotify [2], where P2P can improve user experience and <i>reduce</i> their bandwidth costs. I don&#x27;t know how their systems work but this clearly demonstrates the business value in P2P.<p>As you say yourself, <i>&quot;the internet is already a system of decentralized networks and services&quot;</i> but don&#x27;t dismiss the work taken to get there and the value that the lack of centralisation brings. Those same benefits can be gained elsewhere provided the appropriate tools/infrastructure are made available and useable.<p>Hypothesis: If there were FOSS tools that make it easier to create secure, decentralised systems, more developers would create secure, decentralised products.<p>[1] <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/help/137/en\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.dropbox.com/help/137/en</a><p>[2] <a href=\"http://community.spotify.com/t5/Help-Desktop-Linux-Mac-and/Unadvertised-P2P-feature/m-p/400160#M46512\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://community.spotify.com/t5/Help-Desktop-Linux-Mac-and/U...</a>",1387311607

My general take is that they make it way too easy to do the wrong thing though, at very little gain (assuming other parts of your system are setup properly).<p>---<p>For nesting, the problem with nesting is that is messed with specificity way too much. Since adding an extra class inside a nested block is trivial, people start adding more and more. But even just 2 classes is already too much in my opinion. Ideally each component would have classes on each of its inner elements, so that the component-level styles always have a specificity of 0010:<p><pre><code>  <div class=&quot;textfield&quot;>\n    <label class=&quot;textfield-label&quot;></label>\n    <input class=&quot;textfield-input&quot;>\n  </div>\n</code></pre>\nIf you have a setup like that, you never need to nest because your CSS ends up looking like this:<p><pre><code>  .textfield {}\n  .textfield-label {}\n  .textfield-input {}\n</code></pre>\nAnd that way all of your selectors are minimally invasive in terms of specificity. The problem with nesting is that you end up with selectors that have a specificity of 0020, which means anyone implements those components needs to be sure to achieve that level of specificity or greater to override them.<p>But honestly, when working with small components there just isn&#x27;t that much typing to justify the possible downsides. Sure I have to type out the extra selectors in the beginning a few more times, but its worth it to do without the unintended consequences of the magic.<p>The one case where nesting really does come in handy is for page-specific or app-specific stylesheet files. Places where you are adding the &quot;glue&quot; CSS that should always be namespaced to avoid collisions.<p>---<p>For mixins, I feel like they only seem useful if the components you&#x27;re using are broken into small enough pieces to begin with. For example, if you want a complex gradient system on your buttons, put that inside your button styles and then don&#x27;t touch it from anywhere else. If you&#x27;re constantly needing to use a mixin to re-define those styles, something else is wrong. Because realistically how many different color variations of those buttons do you need to make? It should be somewhat limited, and they should be able to exist in a single file without issue.<p>Where things really get screwed is if you aren&#x27;t versioning your mixins (which most people aren&#x27;t doing). At that point, you&#x27;re just tightly coupling changes to that mixins across your entire codebase. If you want to change the way the buttons implement the gradient, with the mixin system you go change the mixin, but now you need to visit every other component that uses that mixin and double-check that you didn&#x27;t break anything.<p>Instead, if you didn&#x27;t use a mixin and the component just contained its gradient logic (slightly more verbose maybe, but way more maintainable) then you don&#x27;t have that problem.<p>The other solution is to strictly version your mixins using something like Component and maintain your mixins in a separate repository on GitHub that gets versioned, then that also works because each other component can peg the version of the mixin it is using.<p>---<p>My big takeaway from CSS though is that none of the solutions for it are nice right now. And most of these problems should disappear (I think) with proper native extension.",1387311593

Using generic class names like `titlebar` is likely to result in namespace collision.  I define a project by modules, and use a slightly bastardized version of the block, element, modifier naming scheme to prevent this.  It&#x27;s verbose, but I consider the extra typing a reasonable price to pay for the ease of maintenance.  For example: `.mod-modal`, `.mod-modal--title`, `.mod-modal--button_large_danger`.  A sparse library of grid and spacing utility classes allow flexible formatting without having to write new definitions for every variation of your modules.  Content hooks are provided for edge cases where you really do need to override some module styles for a specific page or design element.  I use a `myproj-contentdescriptor` naming scheme.  I apply these liberally but rarely define them in the stylesheet.  The excessively convoluted naming scheme prevents leakage and interference from 3rd party libraries.  It makes for some ugly-ass markup, but this is a pattern I&#x27;ve settled on after 10 years of CSS day job.<p>Edit: Ian just argued the same case more eloquently.  This methodology seems to be gaining traction amongst framework authors over the last two years.",1387311593

Foreign firms and governments hesitate to trust US firms with their data. US firms lose contracts and relationships sour.<p>3) US firms whose interests are hurt lobby for surveillance reform<p>Personally, I think the crux of the issue is the doctrine that, if a company is a party to handling my data, whether privately or as part of delivery to another person, that company may voluntarily share information with the government. I think it&#x27;s a failing of our constitutional law against unreasonable search and seizure that this precedent was set. (I&#x27;m not a lawyer but that is my understanding - please correct me if I&#x27;m wrong.)<p>In the modern world, virtually all of our communication involves other companies, and so if those companies can voluntarily act as effectively agents of the government in providing the government data, then from my perspective this dodges the intent of the Fourth Amendment. Especially given modern adoption of cloud computing - my papers and personal effects are rarely present solely on my property. Technological progress in cloud computing should not erode fundamental constitutional protections. With that precedent, it has.<p>As all data increasingly goes digital, it is wrong for our society to present a conflict of interest: either keep my data myself, and lose out on modern technology; or use modern technology and be subject to omnipresent surveillance. The better option is to reform our laws so that constitutional protections extend to digital information, wherever it is kept, as well as &quot;papers&quot;.<p>Would it be reasonable to change the laws of our society such that no person may share another person&#x27;s digital information with the government [1], except as required by law, or unless they specifically believe that person guilty of wrongdoing? Perhaps such an approach could form the basis for much more effective protection against unreasonable search.<p>[1] I realize getting this right is going to be tough. Perhaps it&#x27;s &quot;no digital information created by the person, or metadata about that information&quot;. What I&#x27;d be looking for is a reasonable digital equivalent of &quot;papers and effects&quot;.<p>Perhaps such a relationship could be negotiated through private contract today (e.g. terms of service). The asymmetrical relationship makes this difficult to achieve as a consumer. (This leads me to wonder: do the terms of service of major Internet firms permit them to share your information with the government?)<p>Maybe the first place to start is pushing Internet companies to adopt terms of service that prohibit sharing your information with government agencies (or with any other firm who does not have such a clause in its relationship with the first company), except as required by law.<p>If the tech companies who met with the President want to lead reform in this space, they could begin by changing their terms of service to explicitly prohibit voluntarily sharing your data with governments or firms who may voluntarily share that data with governments. Of course, that might strain their relationships with those governments, and harm their business in a different way, so it will be interesting to see how this plays out.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that business reasons are the only reasons. I do believe that plenty of people and firms want to change the situation on its merits. It&#x27;s just also interesting to me to look at this issue from the perspective of business impact.",1387311576

How much times have you wrote such statements?<p><pre><code>    X.prototype.foo = function() {\n        var self = this;\n        // or\n        var that = this;\n        this.bar().then(function(x) {\n            that.baz(x);\n        });\n    };\n</code></pre>\nor\n    }.bind(this));<p>With yield you can just write your logic, not a boilerplate:<p><pre><code>    X.prototype.foo = async(function*() {\n        var x = yield this.bar();\n        this.baz();\n    });</code></pre>",1387311051

I think that there may actually be a difference between what this practice can do for you and the experience of being in the flow.  However, I think they are closely related.  My idea of what it means to be the flow, you are, in a sense, not acting from your conscious &quot;I&quot; mind, but just kind of acting without acting.  This is the whole Taoist Wu-Wei concept.  But really, you are coming from the space from which thought arises, rather than the thought itself.<p>So when you are in the flow with coding, swim, or bike ride, you are in the midst of an action that granted you access to this state.  But you did not actually consciously enter this directly state by choice.<p>But the I think the trap can be that you can only access this when you are doing things that lead to being in the flow.  What about being able to enter this state when you are really upset about something or when things are going badly, or when you are bored, or when you are doing something compulsively.<p>The practice I believe is trying to access this state at random times of the day, and especially in those times when you are not engaged in an activity that lends itself to this awareness, but actually engaged in activities that do the opposite (such as being annoyed at someone).<p>The idea is that you are building this muscle that allows you to access the &quot;flow&quot; more and more and eventually maybe realize that in some way can always access the space from which thought arises, because that space must always exist.<p>But again, this is theory. Practice is hard.  I&#x27;ll take a moment now.<p>The concept for this came from this ebook.

It was the first company that I interviewed at for a full time roll and it made me realize I wasn&#x27;t ready.  I spent the next 8 weeks coding for three hours a day and preparing for interviews.  Ended up landing a great job that I&#x27;d take over Palantir any day.",1387310470

Google will likely eventually build Dart into normal Chromium and Chrome and build a plugin for Firefox, which nobody will use. Others will build a Dart VM using asm.js to make Dart work efficiently within Firefox. Any successful new browser languages will be able to compile back down to Javascript, although after a while they will be buggy as the Javascript stops getting as much maintenance.",1387310445

Your users may be accustomed to tolerate very slow service times (e.g. most corporate systems inject several-hundred millisecond delays for the most trivial of operation). Etc.<p>I&#x27;ve built plenty of .NET-based services, and generally it was very powerful hardware serving a relatively small user base, and where expectations were much less demanding. And that&#x27;s perfectly fine if the other benefits of the system (tooling, integration, etc) works for the implementation.<p>For someone building a startup on a shoe-string budget, though, it has to be foreboding seeing such poor metrics when that directly translates into considerable additional hosting expenses.",1387310437

2028384,comment,2027557,2027557,0,0,beej71,,,"I'd like to see the trivial code snippet that uses simple trig and other axis data to handle both tilt methods at any orientation.<p>Imagine your device is sitting face-up on your desk.  The acceleration vector is pointing out the back of the screen (gravity).  Now if you rotate the device 90 degrees (keeping it face up on your desk), the acceleration vector remains unchanged, pointing out the back of the screen toward the center of the Earth.  Edit: it's exactly as if you never moved it. :-)<p>And as the device approaches this extreme, it becomes more and more difficult to use the 3rd axis to discern exactly what the user ""means"", especially with a noisy accelerometer.<p>The general problem is that the accelerometer vector needs to change in order for you to use it for control.  And for each of the two tilt types the author shows, it's really easy to come up with a device orientation in which the accelerometer vector remains unchanged regardless of the amount of user tilt.<p>I mean, something can be done up to a point, but I think ""works both ways in any orientation"" is going to be tough.  There might be a reason why the author has not seen any games do that. :-)",1292950683

2028369,comment,2027800,2028300,0,0,KirinDave,,,"From Ruby and Python, the benefits are obvious. These languages are much older designs with less sophisticated runtimes. Their relative stagnation is probably one of the factors that allowed Node.js to explode.<p>From common lisp, Clojure is a very interesting step. It's much more practical and has a modern structure-reduction style that common lisp predates. It also has all the might of the jvm and that strong and community behind it; the comprehensive std lib that was common lisp's original advantage now looks small and dated in comparison.<p>As for Haskell, a similar situation exists with Scala. Haskell will continue to be an interesting platform, but the huge amount of work to adopt many of these concepts to the jvm and an object-oriented world have a lot to offer people.<p>The other hidden benefit is that the jvm can be a new common platform, with java as the new ""C glue"" layer. You can realistically write a library in Clojure and have it a client to Scala code, which runs critical services inside a JRuby rails app.<p>So yes, the jvm language community is coming together with big value propositions quickly. They're beginnig to coalesce in a way the CLR family of languages never really has.<p>P.S., All the languages named here have value and interest and a lot of hard work in them.

Thank you.<p>Creating multiple mockups of the same page isn't viable because you can copy and paste the contents of one mockup to another. Also, it takes some time to create a decent mockup, so a one-time-use scheme would be hard to implement. Charging for collaboration might be viable, but my gut says there's a better way to make money.<p>I feel like the import tool is huge too and I'm not sure how to sell it. I could reposition jMockups as a tool that lets you redesign your existing site--that might be an option. I've kind of been going down the hybrid path: Create a site from scratch <i>or</i> redesign an existing site (that was going to be my landing page headline, almost verbatim). But that's exactly focusing on a niche...<p>Regarding pricing, I think a free version is essential. Yes there's a demo video and yes there's a demo mockup, but I'm not sure a lot of folks would commit to $x/month without creating at least one mockup of their own. I could reduce the free limit from 3 to 1, but I'm not sure that's the best solution either. But I think you're right that a higher priced plan is a good idea, both in terms of its value and in terms of making the cheaper plan seem like a better deal.<p>Again, really good feedback.

I can make no particular comment as to the frequency of their use by the best hit squads in the world.<p>The subject of the article was shot with a 22WMR (Winchester Magnum Rimfire) round. This round can use the same bullet as the 22lr round but contains lots more powder.<p>The velocity of the bullet leaving the barrel of the firearm depends on how fast the charge contained in the casing wants to push it and how much the barrel wants to slow it down due to friction. Almost all rifles barrels are between 16.5"" and 24"". For a average 22WMR round shooting an 40-grain (unit of mass) bullet out of a mid-length rifle barrel one would expect the bullet to leave the barrel at around 2000 feet/sec. The deceleration caused by friction can be altered by changing the exterior-most material of the bullet: a full metal jacket (usually lead totally encased by copper) is potentially slicker than a jacketed soft-point (only partially encased, with the tip exposed).<p>A Ruger Single Six is a type of handgun. The story describes a single-action revolver, which the Single Six is not, but let's ignore that. It comes in barrel lengths of 2.75"", 4"", and 6"". Out of a 4"" or 6"" barrel, the 22WMR has about 1400-1600 feet/sec of velocity. This is roughly comparable with the upper (or hot) range for a 22lr fired out of a rifle barrel.",1292948780

In 11 years of Erlang programming I have only used it a handful of times. You can easily replicate it's behaviour with the gen_server in any case. Furthermore explaining it's use clearly turned out to be complicated. Rather than confuse readers, and add pages to an already lengthy book, we decided to skip it. If you clearly understand gen_server, superviser, application, and gen_event you will be able to pick up gen_fsm when you need to. If we do a second edition perhaps we can include the FSM as an appendix.<p>The gen_fsm implementation is elegant and I do recommend taking a look at it but you probably won't find yourself using it all too often.

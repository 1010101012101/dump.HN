6107344,comment,6104354,6105953,1,0,phlo,,,"You&#x27;re attacking the problem from the wrong angle. The fault lies with whomever builds the application /interfacing/ with the DB, not whomever manages the database.<p>In an application you may need to read user-selected data from some sort of database. As a simple example, you might accept a user&#x27;s input of an article ID to fetch said article from a db. That might look something like this:<p>&quot;SELECT * FROM articles WHERE id = $article_id&quot;<p>Where $article_id is the input you received from your user. A valid $article_id could for example be &quot;7&quot;, an invalid one might be &quot;7 OR 1=1&quot;. If the latter value is not escaped, it&#x27;d change the statement to read &quot;SELECT * FROM articles WHERE id = 7 OR 1=1, returning all articles.<p>Any somewhat competent programmer would then check if $article_id contains a value of the expected type (i.e. integer, string, string that looks like an email address, ...) and use an escaping function (in PHP this might be mysql_real_escape_string) to escape any special characters (e.g. turn &quot; into \&quot;).<p>If you&#x27;re doing things right, you&#x27;ll use a prepared statement. You&#x27;ll tell your database driver the format of your query first (&quot;SELECT * FROM articles where id = ?&quot;), then provide the contents for your placeholders (? -> $article_id).<p>Prepared statements are considered more elegant and comfortable to work with; both approaches are secure when done correctly.<p>All of this is done by the application developer. Now the DBA only gets to work with the assembled query. How would they be able to tell a valid &quot;OR 1=1&quot; from an injected one?<p>Nonetheless, your point on holding the responsible party accountable stands -- but it&#x27;s the developers, not the DBAs.",1374831725

6107336,comment,6101815,6102899,1,0,Kliment,,,"Proper door design makes a huge difference when a lot of people unfamiliar with said door need to use it in a short period of time and the cost of a delay can be congestion or even injury. Evacuation scenarios, rush hour traffic, black friday sales, that sort of thing. It doesn&#x27;t make a huge difference to doors only a few people use a couple of times a day.<p>That said, door design is a good example for many other things. To give you a particular one, a certain DVD player/recorder made by Panasonic has two large buttons on the upper corners of its front panel. One is the on/standby button and the other is the eject button. They placed the on/off button right next to the DVD tray, and literally everyone who has attempted to place a DVD in it has accidentally turned it off instead.

6107334,comment,6105109,6106805,2,0,wozniacki,,,"Firstly I am - as others surely are - sufficiently interested in this premise.<p>At first brush (and to the layperson who is not steeped either in digital physics or simulation theories) this seems like a good contender in the legion of theories of this sort that seek to explain the nature of our observable universe (as it appears to the human consciousness)<p>I looked up the reviews of Amazon for the book, &quot;Programming the Universe&quot; and some reviews seems to suggest that the author largely treads on thin ice in several areas.<p>For example:<p><i>I&#x27;ve always admired the notion (first promulgated by Voltaire?) that the true measure of intelligence is the ability to simultaneously comprehend two mutually contradictory ideas. So I tend to take a mellow approach to ideas that I disagree with. However, this book angered me, not because of its ideas, but because of its serious flaws.<p>The first serious flaw is that the author cannot keep his ego from seeping into the text. He regales us with triumphant tales of how he confounded his students with deep questions and then nobly revealed the true answers. Sheesh, man, why use the dialog approach using weaklings as your interlocutors? Pit yourself against somebody who can do more than behave as your straight man. Argue with yourself, if you have to! But presenting yourself as the all-knowing professor rubbed my fur the wrong way.<p>The problem of author vanity permeates the entire book. At no point does the author admit to uncertainty, or present two sides of a case, or even admit that anything he writes is controversial. One gets the strong impression that everything is crystal clear to this author. That impression raises my hackles.<p>The overwhelming self-assurance of the author explodes in his face when he gets it wrong. In the section &quot;Exorcising Maxwell&#x27;s Demon&quot; in Chapter 4, he writes:<p>&quot;The full exorcism of the demon was not accomplished until recently. (I played some part in this ceremony myself.)&quot;<p>Perhaps Mr. Lloyd is older than I imagine. The exorcism of Maxwell&#x27;s Demon was accomplished by Leon Brilloun, the physicist who patented the atomic bomb, in a paper published in 1951. Mr. Brilloun does not mention any contribution by Mr. Lloyd. It would appear that Mr. Lloyd is unaware of Mr. Brilloun&#x27;s paper. Worse, his explanation of the exorcism of Maxwell&#x27;s Demon is a turgid mess that makes no sense at all. Between claiming credit for another man&#x27;s achievement and botching the explanation of Maxwell&#x27;s Demon, I reached the limit of my tolerance. I literally threw the book away from me at that point.<p>Perhaps the material after Chapter 4 redeems the book; I do not know, because I did not read it.<p>The other serious flaw in the book is its smarmy vagueness. In attempting to avoid the intimidating reliance on mathematical and technical definitions, Mr. Lloyd resorts to poetic phrasings. These would be acceptable if they weren&#x27;t so damned cute -- and if they made sense. For example, in attempting to make clear the difference between energy and information he writes, &quot;Energy makes physical systems do things. Information tells them what to do.&quot; At first glance, that seems a pithy observation. But go back and read it again; what is the author really saying? Does energy give molecules speed, and information give them direction? Does the energy in an A-bomb make the bang and information tells it what to destroy?<p>I was disconcerted by the author&#x27;s fuzziness regarding information. He never defined it -- which is not necessarily a fatal flaw, given that a book for the educated public should not burden its readers with undue technical detail. But he used the term in such a myriad of ways that I started to think that he was using it to refer to any magically powerful force. Information, in this book, seems capable of performing wondrous feats.<p>Physics is finally coming to terms with the concept of information as a physical concept. The change began after World War II and has been edging forward for fifty years; in the last ten years, progress has accelerated. A clearer concept of information and its relationship to the physical universe is emerging.

OSes are not really designed with security first in mind, while they should be the first ones to do research on it, and apply it steadily.<p>I can find many reasons why the computer security market is still weak: there are not that many crimes because we don&#x27;t use computers for many important things (even if it&#x27;s on the rise), intelligence agencies prefer to let those vulnerabilities in place so they can have the upper hand to investigate or spy other countries (not talking about PRISM), and programmers are still a rare supply, and I don&#x27;t really see any open discussion in university about computer security theory, it&#x27;s mostly black hats/white hats folks, it&#x27;s not really productive.<p>If those guys committed those crimes, either they are not good enough, but that also means nasdaq systems were weak, or that they were actually good enough, but the computer security job market did not propose them enough money, which is why they risked 20 year prison sentences, because it paid more.<p>You could compare it with the drug market. Right now those substances are illegal, which allows criminals to make huge amounts of money, but the DEA people will also make money, and are often found to work with criminals. That&#x27;s an example why most of the time, crime pays, while it would be wiser to make those substance legal, and try to help drug users instead. For computer security, it could be a good idea to stimulate the security market by asking universities to create degrees, and maybe make some government programs to work on computer security, instead of letting it rot like that.",1374831366

Yes, the start up is new but the guys behind DO are really old players.<p>The guys behind DO had a hosting company called &#x27;Reality Check Network&#x27;, it was great. They were new that time and if you google about Reality Check Network you will find a bad incident because of which it was shut down.<p>In 2010, their servers were hacked and the attackers corrupted the filesystems which forced them to reformat everything. They were managing around 1,000 servers that time and the backup system in 2010 wouldn&#x27;t allow them to restore so many servers at once, the only option they had was to do it manually which required 4 man hours of work for each server. And that process could take more than 2 months because of the 4000 odd man hours required to do the job.<p>This was from a long email they sent to their customers, which shows they were transparent and admitted the issue and the problem. ( Unlike many reliable servers which are not being transparent and cause a lot of problem/trust issue. Linode? )<p>From what it looks like, for almost a month they tried getting all the data back but eventually couldn&#x27;t so they folded and moved on. Almost 6-8 months later in 2011, they launched DO and been almost 3 years they are doing great. Rather best. No such incident and data is secure. They surely learned their lesson.<p>I would say despite their past, they are the experienced players whom we can trust.

It can be frustrating, but get over it. You didn&#x27;t get the job you wanted.<p>I also think it&#x27;s pretty arrogant to assume that any hiring manager is going to want to or be able to give you the information as to why the offer was rescinded. If anything, I&#x27;d probably train my hiring managers to not tell people why they weren&#x27;t hired. Saying &quot;You weren&#x27;t hired because of xxxx&quot; seems like a way of getting into an argument or giving people enough information to start legal proceedings.<p>Given the tone of the article, and the fact that you went so public with your non-hiring, I&#x27;m going to assume Reuters dodged a bullet with this one. Did you tell Reuters you were going to publish their private emails to you? Did you give them any opportunity to reply?<p>Yeah - After reading what you wrote there, I wouldn&#x27;t hire you either.",1374830371

One question in my mind though: what about the databases?<p>Say you have a web app and a reporting app that use the same database (and probably a communications framework - zmq server rabbitmq etc in the middle there as well). How does docker deal with the following:<p>* The data? I can see postgres, redis or whatever being packaged up into containers, but what about the data that they use? Will there be attachable storage? Will you share some exposed resource on the host? Will the data be another container on top of the database app container?<p>* Routing. How do you tell your reporting/web app containers &quot;this is where your message bus and database live?&quot;<p>* Coordination. I&#x27;m used to using something like supervisord to control my processes - what&#x27;s the equivalent in docker land? Replace the scripts in supervisord with the equivalent dockerized apps? A docker file for the host specifying what to run? How do you know if your app that you&#x27;ve run inside docker has crashed?<p>* Or do you just package the whole lot above up into one container?<p><i>edit</i> actually that was more than one :-)",1374829411

Systematically, and with the full acquiescence of the favored population.</i><p>I&#x27;m sorry, but you are displaying a remarkable level of naivet and outright stupidity about how history happened.<p>Hitler was not democratically elected. Hitler had only been a legal German citizen, permitted to run for office, for less than one month. Hitler ran for President with the intention of using the office to destroy the constitution and establish a dictatorship (under which it is extremely dubious to justifiably assess &#x27;full acquiescence&#x27; of the population). He assumed the presidency after losing the election because Hindenburg died two years after defeating Hitler, and Hindenburg ran for re-election expressly to prevent Hitler from becoming president. After Hindenburg reluctantly appointed Hitler as Chancellor, the 1933 elections were an inarguably <i>un</i>democratic election, in which new &quot;elections&quot; were held after Hitler urged dissolution of the Reichstag. The Nazis relied on widespread violence and intimidation, culminating in the Reichstag fire and subsequent laws that eviscerated civil liberties and imprisoned political opponents. The Nazis even &quot;monitored&quot; the elections to ensure they achieved a majority.<p>Slavery, Jim Crow, McCarthyism, sexism, paternalism, COINTELPRO, etc.--all these have strong places in American history of being the norm, not the aberration, and being accepted as a matter of course.",1374829310

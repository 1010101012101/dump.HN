I throw things out wantonly and refuse gifts. I buy things only when they are something I critically need, and even then I wait a while.<p>There is not only the mental cost of stuff that PG mentions, but the cost of transportation, storage and disposal (a cost which has become much more significant - garbage tip costs in Australia seem to have gone up several orders of magnitude faster than everything else since I was a kid).<p>I'm not sure if you can achieve a cure vicariously or if you actually have to go through the mentally scarring process of moving the same 12 old PCs that you'll freecycle one of these days through 8 houses, but try asking yourself ""If I buy this now ...

That's my personal politics.<p>However, it's one thing to think this intrusion is a ""digital misdemeanor"" and another thing to act like you can't fathom why anyone would see it otherwise. You have your perspective, but the police and the prosecutor and evidently at least some people at MIT: 1) had no idea who Swartz was or what his agenda was; 2) didn't share his politics; 3) weren't familiar with the ""hacker culture""; and 4) were rattled by the target being an institution like MIT.

Reading this book will change the way you see the world. If you are interested in Chomsky, it is likely that you are a noble person who genuinely cares for others and yearns for a better world. Beware, reader, and make sure you choose the right vehicle for your hope. While his intentions are for a peaceful, safe, and healthy world, Chomsky's political writings systematically assume conscious malevolence without evidence, ignore context, and romanticize Third World struggles, regardless of their goals.<p>Let's briefly examine some of his convictions on a pressing topic: the War on Terror. Following the September 11th attacks, Chomsky immediately presented them as our fault: the result of U.S. Middle East policy, and equally evil U.S. Cold War efforts (training Mujahadeen to oust the Soviets from Afghanistan). His presumption here is that if the United States changes its behavior, that terrorist attacks will then cease. Islamic terrorists, in fact, want a pan-world government under Talibanesque repressive sharia law, a vision that mandates the overthrow of all free nations beginning with ours. These facts are easily learned by reading about the historical development of Islamic radicalism, which is rooted in reinterpretations of the Qur'an's dictates for action, NOT in wishes to live peacefully in a U.S.-free Middle East. These facts, however, do not enter into the Chomskyan world-view, which romanticizes Third World underdogs as brave and legitimized no matter what they stand for.<p>The linguist also described the U.S.-led invasion of Afghanistan as a conscious ""silent genocide,"" predicting wrongly that millions would be severed from food supplies. As is typical, Chomsky here focused solely on the negative aspects of the situation, those for which the U.S. deserved his bitter recrimination. For a man who lives prosperously in America and is supposedly the voice of the downtrodden, Chomsky certainly did not put himself into the shoes of the Afghan women. For them, whose existence was akin to slavery, the liberation was a cause for great joy. Actual sentiments were fully antithetical to Chomsky's condemnatory remarks to his villainous U.S. government, which he and he alone believed was consciously bent on killing as many innocent Afghans as possible. Omitting what is significant (the liberation of people living under tyranny, in this case) to emphasize his often ludicrous misperceptions about American motives and motivations is a constant in Chomsky's writings. His Cold War depictions are even more stunning, as Understanding Power's abundant examples attest.<p>In the case that you are already entrenched in his manner of thinking, at least admit that Noam Chomsky MIGHT be wrong, and see if his positions hold up under review: read Chomsky's articulate, sane critics (The Anti-Chomsky Reader is a good place to start). If he is perfect, then you have nothing but gain to acheive from this exercise; it will only serve to strengthen your ability to effectively argue and implement Chomsky's ideas in the world. After clear-eyed reassessment of his political writings, if you STILL think he is on-point, then all the best to you. If, however, you reevaluate his ""wisdom,"" you will have saved yourself from much needless confusion and despair.<p>Were Chomsky's views simply false, there would not be need for this posting. They become perilous, however, in their blind, wholesale demonization of the United States. Chomsky's own fear and anger about the state of our world are projected, with great urgency: anger at and fear of U.S. ""elites"" is the Chomsky program. The result is often flat-out hatred. What would Chomsky do were he President? We do not know; he avoids that inconvenient question by telling us that were he to run (which he admits he would never do), the first thing he would do is tell us not to vote for him. Furthermore, why does Professor Chomsky not include himself in the ""elites"" so prominent in his analyses? Does he not pay taxes, and drive a BMW, and teach at a cushy, prestigious university? The questions may seem too simplistic, but they point to a core issue: if Chomsky cannot look into the mirror regarding his own status and societal position, then how much more impaired must his assessments be of things outside of himself? On paper, it is unclear exactly what Chomsky IS calling for, and putting aside the constant onslaught of judgment-filled writings and audio programs, neither does his life provide us an example of what he conceives to be right-action. Those who want an idea of who believes IN Chomsky, however, need look no further than Hugo Chavez, who recently proclaimed allegiance and military support to his ""brother"" Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Ahmadinejad, for anyone who needs reminding, daily denies the Holocaust, and calls for the destruction of Israel and the United States. Is it a coincidence that those who love Chomsky also embrace a world-view rooted in blame, anger, and vilification?<p>Good and evil do exist in this world, but Noam Chomsky is not capable of distinguishing between the two. The U.S.A. is not perfect, and never will be. Nevertheless, if we fail to recognize the good that IS here, we may soon lose our nation. Chomsky's writings are little more than a good reminder that appearance is not essence. It is worth noting as well, that Chomsky is an avowed atheist, and believes that life is meaningless. If we bear in mind that evil is in the eye of the beholder, then Chomsky--an American, an Israelite, a millionaire--is instantly unmasked in all of his self-revulsion. Understanding Power should be retitled as ""Understanding Blame."" Stear clear and take heart, reader; there is hope in this world, and your country is good, but you will discover neither in Avram Noam Chomsky.",1358285883

Sorry for the wall of text:<p>""Its precisely the opposite of conspiracy theory, actuallyin fact, in general this analysis tends to downplay the role of individuals: theyre just replaceable pieces.<p>""Look, part of the structure of corporate capitalism is that the players in the game try to increase profits and market sharesif they dont do that, they will no longer be players in the game. Any economist knows this: its not a conspiracy theory to point that out, its just taken for granted as an institutional fact. If someone were to say, Oh no, thats a conspiracy theory, people would laugh. Well, what weve been discussing are simply the institutional factors that set the boundaries for reporting and interpretation in the ideological institutions. Thats the opposite of conspiracy theory, its just normal institutional analysis, the kind of analysis you do automatically when youre trying to understand how the world works. For people to call it conspiracy theory is part of the effort to prevent an understanding of how the world works, in my viewconspiracy theory has become the intellectual equivalent of a four-letter word: its something people say when they dont want you to think about whats really going on.""<p>[...]<p>""Well, this term conspiracy theory is kind of an interesting one. For example, if I was talking about Soviet planning and I said, Look, heres what the Politburo decided, and then the Kremlin did this, nobody would call that a conspiracy theory  everyone would just assume that I was talking about planning. But as soon as you start talking about anything thats done by power in the West, then everybody calls it a conspiracy theory. Youre not allowed to talk about planning in the West, its not allowed to exist. So if youre a political scientist, one of the things you learnyou dont even make it into graduate school unless youve already internalized itis that nobody here ever plans anything: we just act out of a kind of general benevolence, stumbling from here to here, sometimes making mistakes and so on. The guys in power arent idiots, after all. They do planning. In fact, they do very careful and sophisticated planning. But anybody who talks about it, and uses government records or anything else to back it up, is into conspiracy theory.<p>""Its the same with business: business is again just operating out of a generalized benevolence, trying to help everybody get the cheapest goods with the best quality, all this kind of stuff. If you say: Look, Chrysler is trying to maximize profits and market share, thats conspiracy theory. In other words, as soon as you describe elementary reality and attribute minimal rationality to people with powerwell, thats fine as long as its an enemy, but if its a part of domestic power, its a conspiracy theory and youre not supposed to talk about it.""",1358285207

It is a natural coping mechanism to prevent the monopolization of our limited attention spans.<p>For example, gun violence has been a constant thing in the US.  The crowds get tired of hearing about it and the drive for legislation goes no where.  However, when something out of the ""ordinary"" happens, such as the grievous Newtown murders, the attention of the crowd has been once again achieved.  Politicians know this and the ones pushing legislation know they need to act fast before fatigue and indifference kick in, and the ones against the legislation know it's a waiting game.<p>My point is that the process of crowds demanding the removal of an out of control prosecutor isn't going to get easier (aka more likely to happen) just because it happened this time.<p>We have a limited window to act based on the attention of the crowd that has resulted form Aaron's suicide.  I believe when people say something to the effect of ""your missing the point"" when removing a specific prosecutor, they are trying to get this point across.<p>In our limited window of action, we can remove someone specific, or find away to address the more general problem of prosecutorial overreach while we still have the mic.

5062992,story,,,9,9,nivals,"Ask HN: I just sold the company now what?",,"Background, I started a B2B data backup company at the end of 2005/early 2006 worked on it for several years before realizing that I was missing something in my personal development that was limiting my success.<p>I love solving hard problems, building products, love hardware and building/maintaining bare metal servers. I did not like the sales/biz dev side of things. In an effort to continue my professional development, I decided to move to NYC and get a masters degree. Before the move I turned over the management of the business to others. While in NYC I was fortunate to work at two of the hottest startups in town, I learned a lot about myself and scaling businesses.<p>Fast forward six years, the business continued to grow even in the face of stiff competition and plunging prices for cloud storage/online backup. A month ago the business sold to a larger competitor.<p>Over the years we moved data centers (twice!) and completely rebuilt our infrastructure three times. We made mistakes and a few good decisions. The best decision we made was in our last data center move.<p>HN, here is where I need some help: I'm left with a few things lots of hardware, storage, bandwidth, and rack space.<p>At this point I'm trying to figure out what do with all of this stuff. I don't want to shell out the cash for the data center space each month if I don't have a use for it, however I will never get a deal like this again and don't want to give it up I really love not being a slave to Amazon/Linode and hosting with my own servers.<p>If someone has any ideas I'd love to hear em or if you have servers that would be too expensive to host elsewhere because of bandwidth costs, I'd be happy to host them for you without any bandwidth fees. Just cover the costs of power. I've got a gigabit right now that is billed at a flat rate so bandwidth hogs and services like that are ideal.",1358283975

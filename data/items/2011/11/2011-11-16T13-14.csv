The reality out in the real word though is much different. Many companies have managers that have never worked on software in their life, there is a school of thought that management is management, and for some disciplines it is true management is transferable, those of us in technology know this to be idiotic but if you came from a traditional enterprise and have seen multiple manager move from inventory to shipping and be successful you would believe the converse to be true.

I used to spend hours planning out the team movements through the level.<p>Dying or being incapacitated was easy (usually 1 shot in most places) so the only way you could really win was to coordinate very well. You'd be given a map and plan the movement sequences of each team through the level. When you gave a specified ""gocode"", that team would advance to the next checkpoint by running through a corridor or entering a defended room.<p>Then, you'd interleave the paths so that in larger rooms you'd have multiple teams enter simultaneously for maximum effect, because otherwise your team would usually get bottlenecked at the entry point and die.<p>Oftentimes, one of the teams would fall behind or die because of bad planning (or insufficient information while planning). But you'd have to keep going anyway, often with disastrous results. This taught you about failure modes and planning with redundancy.<p>It also taught you about winning the war before it happens. You never ever ever ran into a room guns ablaze. That's a good way to get your entire team killed, and probably the hostage that you're trying to save. Instead, you have one person open the door, another chuck in a flashbang and more to cover you while you get in through the bottleneck. In any reasonable amount of time it would take for your enemies to react, they'd be picked off already. And hopefully the other team did the same on the other side of the room. The whole thing took under 10 seconds. Not much left to chance or shooting ability.<p>I miss the old Rainbow Six. Obviously I don't shoot people for a living, but it was one of those games that actually taught you something.",1321451749

Working now with grails 1.3.7 and I definitely will change to Play after finishing my current project.
Grails is a pain and it doesnt feel very light as its built uppon the spring stack which is huge. Using plugins is sometimes risky as they are outdated and you dont really understand what they are doing in the background.
I also like the type safe approach of Scala/Java which you dont have in grails(groovy/java). This is also very useful for code completion in IDEs",1321451694

This book was widely anticipated and given the unprecedented access that Isaacson had to Jobs' family and Apple execs past and present, this book was mediocre at best.<p>Personally I was really looking forward to it, when I started reading the book I kept making allowances, thinking that maybe I was expecting too much. I don't read many biographies, so perhaps this is how it's done, after all, the Author wrote an apparently well regarded biography on Einstein.<p>But Siracusa nails it, when he says most people don't understand theoretical physics, so a biographer can get away with not understanding the stuff that Einstein is famous for (paraphrase). The same is not true for tech, it's forgivable to not know this stuff, but it is unforgivable that seemingly  he didn't even try, as evidenced by his obvious lack of insight into the motivations of the man he was writing about.<p>I would love to see someone like Gruber or Siracusa write the definitive biography of Steve Jobs, because the Isaacson biography isn't that book.",1321451258

Consider also the sandbagging of number of cores as ""50+"". How big is the ""+""? In reality the design will have a larger number that is then binned by yield and so forth to give a range of SKUs, as usual.<p>Next, you're comparing a sustained number on DGEMM with theoretical peaks on other machines. Nvidia sustains <225GF on DGEMM with Fermi so this is 4-5x. Last I looked, AMD were sustaining ~500GF with Cayman, so this is 2x, and a much easier machine to sustain perf on for other codes compared to Cayman. If you consider a potentially sandbagged 2x sustained perf to be ""relatively minor"" then so be it.<p>There are few public details provided but many of us have been programming with the Knights Ferry SDV kit in preparation for this part. So we have experience with the tools, with the use of lots of similar cache coherent x86 cores, etc. I can tell you this -- it's much easier to work with this than GPUs, and I've written a ton of code on all kinds of whacky machines, production compute code on GPUs included.",1321450708

Instead, it complained that the CS curriculum was theoretical and used old languages like C, instead of PHP, Python, and Ruby.   IMHO, that's what a CS degree should be.  Most Universities in the US seem to follow the same structure.   They try their best at times to use newer languages, but their job is to teach the fundamentals of Computer Science.   Once you have those fundamentals, picking up new languages should be easy.   The argument that you should be able to come straight out of the university, without any of your own studying on the side (outside of the curriculum), and be ready to work at a company is sort of foolish.   There is no possible way to ready a student for all aspects of a Software Engineering position, so the best thing to do is teach them the theory and fundamentals and hope that enables them to learn quickly on their own.   I've hear arguments of why someone should skip school, and honestly this is one of the poorer reasons to do so.   As an aside, does any major fully prepare you for work in that field?   Electrical Engineering at a University is highly theoretical, and when you get out you start to learn about the real world building blocks to the profession.

7402792,comment,7401803,7401803,53,0,mattjaynes,,,"Have to say I&#x27;m a bit puzzled by the claim of Ansible being &quot;blow your brains out&quot; difficult.<p>In many cases, Ansible is even easier than shell scripts. I wrote a post about this a few months ago: <a href=""https://devopsu.com/blog/ansible-vs-shell-scripts/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://devopsu.com/blog/ansible-vs-shell-scripts/</a><p>I completely understand where the sentiment is coming from though. I wrote a comparison book on Puppet, Chef, Salt, and Ansible a few months ago and am currently finishing the 2nd edition ( <a href=""https://devopsu.com/books/taste-test-puppet-chef-salt-stack-ansible.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://devopsu.com/books/taste-test-puppet-chef-salt-stack-...</a> ). Even for an experienced sysadmin, using Puppet and Chef to do even a trivial project (replacing a ~10 line shell script) took a painful couple of days. Why? They&#x27;re overly complex and have confusing broken documentation (that mostly haven&#x27;t been corrected even 6 months after I gave them a full breakdown on the issues). Salt was pretty smooth, but Ansible was downright easy.<p>Using a shell script to set up a server generally indicates that it will then be managed manually afterwards (sadness and despair!).<p>A huge advantage of using a configuration management (CM) tool is that they&#x27;re &quot;idempotent&quot;. Idempotency basically means that you can run the directives over and over again safely.<p>An idempotent command will verify that the system is how you defined it and will only make changes to bring the system back into alignment with what you defined. That means you can define your system in the language of the CM tool and use it not only for initial system setup, but also for monitoring, updating, and correcting a server&#x27;s configuration over the life of the server.<p>A CM tool can ultimately act like a self-healing test suite for your systems - neat!<p>Your systems are the &quot;app&quot; that your app runs on. They&#x27;re the foundation. Not using a CM tool is like not having any tests for your app. Sure, it might seem faster at first, but you&#x27;ll pay for it in chaos, slowness, bugs, and misery later.<p>Shell scripts are a great first step, but if you&#x27;re serious about your systems, you need to be using a CM tool. Modern ones like Ansible are simple, easy, and have great docs so there&#x27;s little excuse left for not using one now.",1394841571

7402768,comment,7401055,7402337,2,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"> What I think is even more interesting is the fact that advertising, such a wildly inefficient method, right now props up so many industries.<p>What makes you think advertising is inefficient? For specific parties it&#x27;s extremely efficient. It gives the advertiser the power to change the viewer&#x27;s preference between Brand X and Brand Y. Allowing himself to be convinced to buy Brand X in exchange for content allows the viewer to pay for the content with money out of Brand Y&#x27;s pocket instead of his own. In many cases this brings more profit to the content provider than that customer would be willing to pay directly out of pocket. The detriment goes almost entirely to the competing brand who loses a sale to the advertiser.<p>Which is really the trouble for advertisers. Advertising is an arms race. Brand X buys advertising and takes market share from Brand Y, so Brand Y buys advertising to take it back. Repeat until advertising expenses consume a significant portion of the margins for every brand, in all industries across the entire world economy. Kind of a nice business to be in, isn&#x27;t it? Start an economic war and force all sides to bid against each other to buy your weapons.<p>> Imagine if Google released a product tomorrow that was 100% efficient at replacing advertising.. Some sort of beam that just got people to understand/like your product immediately. What would all of these major industries do for revenue?<p>Use the beam to make people like their products enough to pay money for them?<p>A viewer&#x27;s time is worth more to the advertiser than to the viewer, and the content provider profits more from arranging that transaction than selling the content directly for money. Content providers could still sell content for money if advertising somehow disappeared, but they would be significantly less profitable because they would lose their ability to arbitrage the time-for-money transaction between the advertiser and the viewer.",1394840924

I&#x27;m 25 as well and felt like I was in your situation 3 years ago. I was about to graduate with a degree in Management Science and realized that the only jobs set up for me were in finance/consulting/&quot;analysis&quot; (whatever that means). And then I took an entrepreneurship class and saw how much power technical people have. Each group that stood up to present its idea said &quot;we just need a technical cofounder to implement it.&quot; So I said, alright, I never want to be in that situation, so I&#x27;m going to go technical.<p>I spent two years in the workforce doing part time school until I was ready to apply to grad school in CS, and now I&#x27;m here, about to wrap up my first quarter. I have a few tidbits to offer and hopefully they&#x27;ll help.<p>1. I didn&#x27;t decide to go technical because it was my passion. I decided because it would give me leverage and would keep me independent. I hate the idea of relying on someone to implement my stuff. Hate it. Those are fairly superficial reasons, but I&#x27;ve gotten lucky. I now LOVE this shit. I can get enough of it. I NEVER thought I&#x27;d be a systems guy, and now I&#x27;m planning on taking Operation Systems classes (known to kill you here) and looking forward to it. Yes I got lucky, but there&#x27;s a takeaway here: I made a choice and moved forward with a plan based on something that seemed reasonable to me. That&#x27;s really the best you can ever do. Go with your gut, keep trying stuff out enough to give it a chance and you too might get lucky.<p>2. During my time in industry, I did jobs that I didn&#x27;t love. I did them for different reasons. First job: Google Data Analyst (bullshit title, bullshit job). What did it get me? It was an easy intro into the workforce (did not foresee) and it paid for part-time school (foresaw). Once I knew I had my fill at Google, I went to a smaller company through a friend where I got huge exposure to leadership and the ugliness behind business (foresaw) and was introduced to one of the most influential mentors in my life (did not foresee) and now understand many important lessons on recruiting talent, leading teams, dealing with crazy work drama, and much more than I ever expected. I plan to take all those lessons with me onward and hopefully play a very huge role in starting something from scratch.<p>Two takeaways:\na. Make moves that guarantee you something. When I went to Google, I went strictly for the continuing education they&#x27;d pay for, since I knew I wanted to get back to school and needed to take classes to prove myself before I applied. I got more out of it than I expected, but I knew I&#x27;d at least get part-time school paid for.\nb. Talk to people you know and make sure they know what you can do. You up your chances of cool opportunities coming your way. Not guaranteed, but it might surprise you.<p>3. This is just a straight-up takeaway. I&#x27;ve always felt good at almost anything I do, not great, but good, which is really lucky (thought as you feel it can seem like a curse). I tend to be interested in a lot of things (much like you: music, acting (I did improv), literature, econ, design, CS, etc) and do decently pretty quickly at all of them. So how to choose? Time bails you out on this one. Choosing something now is not choosing it forever. But you really have to give it a chance. The probelm I ran into in college was while I was taking one class, all I could think was &quot;oh man, that other class in that other field sounds SO COOL.&quot; But the reality was, if I had been in that class, I&#x27;d think the same int he other direction. What that meant is I never gave anything a true shot. By going to grad school, I&#x27;m taking a different apporach. I&#x27;m allowing myself to obsess over something. And not worry that maybe I&#x27;m missing out on something else. Because if it turns out I am, I&#x27;ll switch to it in time. It&#x27;s hard to do, it takes practice, and the easiest way I&#x27;ve found is to force it on yourself (hence, grad school. I can&#x27;t do anything but CS these days). Whether you decide you love this thing you force on yourself or not, obsessing over it for a short period of time let&#x27;s you determine whether you love it or not. If you don&#x27;t, get rid of it from your life. If you do, you&#x27;ll make progress in developing that skill and then can slowly carve out time for other things but you&#x27;ll have something solid under your belt and you&#x27;ll know that you want to keep it.<p>4. Piece of advice, and don&#x27;t let me overstep my bounds here. I&#x27;m going out on a limb from your short question. If this sounds silly, ignore it.<p>Many pieces of your question sound passive. &quot;I&#x27;ve had jobs..none have thrilled me&quot;. &quot;Georgia Tech pushed me to specialize...&quot; &quot;A lack of funds keeps me from getting help on my ideas&quot;. Literally the terminology you use is passive. And to me, it hints that you&#x27;re waiting for something to happen to you. For the perfect job to find you. For the perfect career to develop in front of you for you to walk down. If this sounds true, then this is the first thing you should change. Most people that I know that are happy have made themselves happy. They&#x27;ve taken their circumstances and are build things given their confinements. Limitations inspire creativity. Use yours as inspiration. You don&#x27;t need money to get people to help you build stuff. You don&#x27;t need a specific degree to do anything. And your job description is rarely your job. Remember that everything in the world is made up. Literally everything. There are no rules that you have to follow, it just seems like that a lot of times. Most of the time, the rules are really just &quot;the easy way.&quot; Take some time to really think about these things that seem to hold you back and see if you can come up with a workaround. If you come up with one, however hard it is, start working towards it. I guarantee you, you&#x27;ll discover that it is easier than you feared.<p>Hope that helps.",1394838651

Given the demographic of this forum, it would pay for you not to assume that you&#x27;re the only one on here that works in the industry (in fact I even hinted at that when I said I use Linux at work - but never mind)<p>Secondly, I was making a general comment about peoples desktops rather than talking specifically about your example (given the lack of details you posted, it would be insane of me to assume I could diagnose your fault with any precision). My point was that generally when people think their computer has locked up / X has crashed, it&#x27;s actually one of the items I mentioned earlier that&#x27;s at fault.<p>The snappy reply was appreciated though </sarcasm>. But given just how unusual your circumstances are (assuming what you said is true) and how much you seem to hate it when others discuss these topics with you; it might be an idea if you clarify your position a little better the next time such a topic arises. Like maybe saying <i>&quot;my crashes aren&#x27;t typical because I&#x27;m a kernel developer, but.....&quot;</i>. This way people don&#x27;t accidentally post something that hits one of those raw nerves you have and it saves us all from a lot of unnecessary condescension.",1394838153

This would have changed if it had made it all the way to release.<p>Second, some details about the store...  &quot;Windows Store apps&quot; can use the IE rendering engine to browse the web, but can&#x27;t use other existing libraries like Gecko or Blink.  &quot;Metro-enabled desktop browsers&quot; like Firefox and Chrome and IE (the terminology comes from an old Microsoft white paper [1]) can take advantage of a special exception to the restrictions placed on most &quot;Metro&quot; apps, but only if they are set as the default browser for both desktop and Metro mode.  And they can&#x27;t be installed like Windows Store apps; you have to install them through the desktop.<p>Metro-enabled desktop browsers (like other desktop apps) can be listed in the Windows Store, but can&#x27;t be installed there.  Instead, the Windows Store page will just contain a link an installer on the developer&#x27;s web site.  Chrome links to their installer from the Windows Store, and we&#x27;d have done the same if we shipped the Metro app in a Firefox release.  (We could still list desktop Firefox in the Windows Store, subject to the same restrictions.)<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.zdnet.com/firefox-for-windows-8-adds-a-touch-of-metro-style-7000011511/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.zdnet.com/firefox-for-windows-8-adds-a-touch-of-m...</a>",1394838029

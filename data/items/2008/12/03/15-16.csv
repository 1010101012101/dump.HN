It's very lowest-common-denominator stuff, but that's what works. Unfortunately the stuff they do tends to be quite expensive, but learn from what they do.<p>If you don't have money I would suggest reading up on marketing psychology, there are a lot of tricks, and try out different ad platforms on the Internet monitoring your return on investment through funnels, click-throughs, etc. to find out what works.<p>Create different ads, viral videos, games, silly websites, and whatever else you can think of. Don't be afraid of ""punch the monkey"" and ""you have just won"" ads - they work or they wouldn't be there. You don't have to tell us here on HN you made them ;-)<p>And don't sell on technological merit, nobody besides techies care about that. Sell on emotion.",1228319996

I want whatever works best, preferably free or cheap; I don't care if it's web-based, VNC-based, or RDP-based.

TechCrunch just covered yesterday about a social network for shoe lovers that folded after two years. Yes gadgets can encompass a lot of niches but you're really only appealing to the niche of hardcore gadget freaks, the ones who drool over every new phone (well, they did before the iphone.)<p>2) Your monetization would be horribly difficult. Reviews would be your biggest draw, but you're drawing the hardest of hardcore buyers, they are smart and able to find the best deal. If your advertiser isn't the cheapest then they're not going to see revenue. Sure the SEO might be such that you get less hardcore fans, but the community is going to be extreme gadget users and thus very likely unfriendly to newbies. The classified idea may get some use but you can't charge for listing, the user might as well use Ebay which promises a bigger audience to see the ad.

(E.g. they can make a bound that will hold on 95% of such experiments.)<p>Bayesians can't do this.  There are lots of other advantages to the Bayesian approach, but to frequentists, nothing could be worth giving up ""coverage"" (confidence intervals obeying their guarantees).<p>P.S.

384396,comment,382899,383824,0,0,Retric,,,"<i>blanket bans on child labor?</i> there is <i>not</i> a blanket ban on child labor. Also while everyone needs to pay taxes there is no need to establish a business in the US.  However, setting up a business increases the owners legal protections so it's a good idea.<p>In specific cases children as young as 2 can work think TV / movies.  The limit on child labor has to do with the numbers of hours worked and the type of work being done.  And this depends on state and local laws.<p>If you read up on child labor it's surprisingly flexible and is primary designed to promote children going to school, limit the numbers of hours worked, and avoid dangerous situations.<p>PS: <a href=""http://www.stopchildlabor.org/USchildlabor/fact1.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.stopchildlabor.org/USchildlabor/fact1.htm</a>\nA few highlights at the federal level:<p>There are 17 Hazardous Orders pertaining to all industries (other than agriculture) that forbid children under age 18 from doing any of the following jobs.<p>9. Mining, other than coal mining.<p>So you can still mine coal.<p>Minimum Age for Non-hazardous Work<p>A child of age 10 or 11 may work as a hand-harvest laborer for no more than 8 weeks in a year.  For older children ""In agriculture, the only restriction on hours of employment is that children cannot work during school hours.""<p>""There are no work hours limitations for 16- and 17-year-olds.""  14 year olds ""cannot work more than 3 hours on a school day or more than 18 hours in a school week, or more than 8 hours on a non-school day or more than 40 hours in a non-school week.""<p>So depending on how dangerous your mowing business was and how many hours a week your worked there was probably nothing wrong.  You would have also needed to be making over minimum wage but this is reduced to 4.25 ""for your first 90 consecutive calendar days of employment with an employer.""",1228317557

384380,comment,383781,383936,0,0,raganwald,,,"> Substitute the word ""adult"" for ""consumers"" in what you say, ""Adults will take as much credit as offered to them."" (No, they won't.)<p>What you are doing is suggesting that being an _Adult_ carries with it certain behaviours such as not spending more money than the adult can afford to repay. However, the word Adult actually means being of a certain age, and perhaps you would like to assume that everyone of that age has that level of maturity and prudence.<p>I think what you really mean is that adults ought not to o these things, and if they do these things, they are defective in some way, and therefore don't count. This is a little like those drug studies where anyone that dies while taking the experimental drug is tossed out of the study.<p>So when I say ""Martha over there got a $26,000 line of credit even though she is a home-maker with no income and no assets in her name,"" you say ""Martha isn't really an adult, she is a foolish child in a woman's body.""<p>The simple fact is, adults do many things you and I might consider reckless or illogical such as borrow more than they can afford.<p>As proof of this, I give you George W.

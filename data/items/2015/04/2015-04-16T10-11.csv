9387047,comment,9386787,9386964,0,0,pea,,,"Hey, great questions, and thanks for the feedback. I agree with you re the &#x27;many projects at once&#x27; sentiment. Let me see if I can clarify:<p>We can charge less because because we have standardised the process with software.<p>When a user leaves feedback on your website with TalkToUsers, the feedback comprises a screenshot, the textual content of the feedback, and the browser/user information.<p>We run some analysis on your feedback over a period, let&#x27;s say a month: where people clicked, certain analytics, sentiment. This includes lots of derived quantitative information (i.e. 10 other people clicked on this div and left feedback). This bunch of data is sent to the UX team when your report is due.<p>The deliverable to the UX team is standardised, which means they can more quickly consume it. They read the derived data, and go through the screenshots. They use their experience to make qualitative judgment: &#x27;Hey, these users aren&#x27;t happy because of x, y, z. This came up in the analytics, and now someone is complaining about it&#x27;. After digesting this, they make an argument for what should come next. They enter their thoughts into the dashboard, and a report is created with the data, and they move onto the next one.<p>So, it takes them a lot shorter period of time to digest the data than alternative solutions, because the process has been streamlined: they are a part of what is essentially still a system driven by software, not people. Their input is vital and could not be done by a machine, but the &#x27;operations&#x27; side of things has been automated.<p>For the reliability, it means that if one of our clients reaches out to us, someone in the UX team will be there and can offer some on-demand insights. It&#x27;s a bit like having lots of smaller Heroku instances, vs. one big AWS one.<p>Does this answer your question? This is a pretty new service, so I&#x27;d love to get any more thoughts.<p>Thanks again.",1429181945

9387034,comment,9385951,9386629,0,0,thaumasiotes,,,"So, I live in Shanghai, which hopefully qualifies as &quot;urban&quot; with a population of over 20 million people (according to wikipedia, almost 10k per square mile, healthily above LA). All of the following situations are routine:<p>1. Dedicated bike lanes.<p>2. Bikes hiding along the side of a street without bike lanes, hoping not to be killed.<p>3. Bikes using the sidewalk.<p>Sharing the sidewalk is far and away the safest thing for the bikers; even if you&#x27;re using a dedicated bike lane you&#x27;ll sometimes have to cross car traffic (say, if you&#x27;re making a left turn -- I&#x27;m willing to do this as part of a giant herd of bikes, but if I&#x27;m on my own I just use crosswalks with the pedestrians). Cars are fast; bikes aren&#x27;t. I could see myself potentially injuring a small child by crashing into them with my bike; I cannot imagine seriously injuring an adult the same way. I have personally been involved in a bike crash; I crashed into a motorized bicycle going the other way in a bike lane. This is much worse in terms of speed differential than a bike hitting a pedestrian, but the total of my injuries was a bleeding knuckle.<p>> The optimal solution is of course to build dedicated bike lanes<p>This is phrased with much more confidence than I believe you can reasonably have. Maybe a better solution is to assume that bikers aren&#x27;t such idiots that they&#x27;ll be crushing children beneath their wheels all the time if you allow them on the sidewalks. I fairly frequently get stuck behind groups of pedestrians when the sidewalk isn&#x27;t wide enough for me to go around them. I&#x27;ve often heard one of them say to another &quot;hey, let that guy by&quot;. I&#x27;ve never heard anyone say &quot;hey, get off the sidewalk&quot;.<p>> If cycling is to be seen as a form of transportation they also need to have access to proper infrastructure.<p>Trust me, cycling is viewed as a form of transportation here. And yes, dedicated bike lanes are all over the place. But it&#x27;s still routine for bikes to use the sidewalk. There are plenty of older areas with wide sidewalks and narrow streets.",1429181738

It&#x27;s only superfine grinds that will clog the filter.<p>I have an aeropress, but I rarely use it.  Maybe I&#x27;m just a clutz, but I always have to wipe the counter down after using an aeropress (especially with the inverted method), while a french press is pretty much mess-free. The aeropress is very fidly.  That&#x27;s great if you&#x27;re in the mood to experiment but not so great if you just want a decent cup of coffee.  I do like the results of the aeropress for making iced coffee, but generally prefer the flavor of french press coffee.  Paper filters remove a lot of coffee&#x27;s flavor-rich oils.<p>The one deal-breaker that some people have with french presses is the sludge they let through, especially when used with a low quality grinder that doesn&#x27;t produce grounds of uniform size.

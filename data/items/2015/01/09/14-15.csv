They were looking at CC as a place where only dumb kids go, or that they were better than where they were or were just looking for a place to hang out and meet people to party.<p>I think that people <i>should</i> be paying something to go. But not too much.<p>I&#x27;ve also observed that people who couldn&#x27;t normally afford CC monetarily also can&#x27;t really afford it timewise. They&#x27;re already working 2 jobs or whatever. And the kind of time commitment education requires simply isn&#x27;t possible.<p>What concerns me also is the continued rise in CC tuition (along with other tuition at other schools). CC works because it&#x27;s cheap and it&#x27;s real college. But once the prices start to rise to real college levels, it stops working.<p>I think when I went it was something like $50/crhr. It&#x27;s well over $150 right now (out of state is over $350). I would not be able to send myself to CC today if I was in the same position.",1420815210

Two points:<p>1) AI taking manual workforce-based jobs. I can&#x27;t help seeing how beneficial the industrialisation of processes has been for humanity. Instead of relying on inaccurate human judgement for manufacturing jobs, we let machines produce perfectly similar assets much better than we can do. This has increased the reliability of the outputs, in addition to lowering the prices of the products, which has made them affordable to many more people. Jobs get more specialised, so like the tools human beings have developed throughout history. Once more, survival entails adaptation. And this is again a matter of  supply and demand. In Spain, where the economic crisis is still hitting the markets and unemployment, having a proper specialised education no longer guarantees landing a job (and it&#x27;s not because evil robots are doing the tasks of leaving scientists).<p>2) AI taking over engineers, lawyers, etc. AI is difficult per se. Nobody comes up with a human replica made of metal by chance. Things take their time, and improvements are gradual. That&#x27;s a matter of fact. At present, AI (plus Machine Learning, Pattern Recognition...) delivers a set of tools that allow us to see father, from the shoulders of giants. We had never been able to digest the amount of data we are capable of doing nowadays. Isn&#x27;t this progress? We haven&#x27;t yet created a creative machine and I don&#x27;t see it coming any time soon.<p>I am so firmly convinced that AI has so much good to do that I just created a blog (http://ai-maker.com/) solely dedicated to AI and its applications, and I&#x27;m going to dedicate my spare time for the following years to grow this side project into something awesome, because that&#x27;s where AI is leading us.",1420814703

I think we need to be especially careful in situations with implicit bias to vet all of our assumptions, because in aggregate, they have really negative impacts on large subgroups of people.<p>Here&#x27;s a link to the source document for the linked article: <a href=""http://www.povertyactionlab.org/publication/are-emily-and-greg-more-employable-lakisha-and-jamal-field-experiment-labor-market-discr"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.povertyactionlab.org/publication/are-emily-and-gr...</a><p>That article references other journal articles that review exactly what you&#x27;re talking about, varying only location.  It appears that it helps, but helps whites more.  I didn&#x27;t read that article (I&#x27;m at work; only have time for so much research, which probably should be no time at all :P)<p>> I&#x27;m not from the US, but don&#x27;t many American blacks have white-sounding names? And I assume those blacks are more likely to come from families that are wealthier and better educated.<p>The article says, &quot;Each resume listed identical qualifications except for one variation... names&quot;<p>I looked into the underlying source article and they list and control for the education of the applicants, which means there&#x27;s no need to judge their education by their name, since you already have it.<p>I think the problem a lot of people have is that it feels a lot like we&#x27;re saying everyone is racist, which feels a lot like an attack.  To spin it a little differently, I&#x27;d personally say we&#x27;re all biased.  You could go through any long list of cognitive biases and implicit racial bias would just be one of the myriad everyone is subject to in some magnitude.  It&#x27;s a matter of being aware of it and really questioning your founding assumptions so you can reduce the bias where possible.  The problem with racism is that it has real and lasting impacts right now on minorities, and is particularly insidious (if you ask me).<p>I really think it would be worth your time to read the article and follow some of the linked articles.

The researcher in question said they were &quot;probably unaware&quot;, and said that &quot;if you ask someone on the hiring committee&quot;, implying that they did not even try to measure whether or not this bias was conscious or not, but that they assume a lot of it was subconscious.<p>It&#x27;s quite possible - even likely - they&#x27;re right about that, but from the description it does not sound like that study is a good basis for demonstrating subconscious basis.<p>> The same resume experiment has been tested with male/female names as well.<p>Many people openly admit to biases against females in certain jobs, so that too is a bad example for establishing <i>subconscious</i> bias.<p>I agree with you that there is a lot of subconscious bias (and the article has much better examples, such as the knife example where there&#x27;s no motive for people to pick the wrong person), but it&#x27;s not clear that the CV example demonstrates subconscious bias.

The combination of these two factors means I have a really hard time &quot;making a good first impression&quot;.<p>I recently completed a programming bootcamp and when I explained this to several of my classmates they made a point of highlighting what a great programmer I am (relatively to our peers) and that I&#x27;m a really great person to work with &quot;once people get to know me&quot;. <i>But, there&#x27;s the crux of the matter for me - in an interview situation, if I&#x27;m ruled out in the first 30 seconds then nobody &quot;gets to know me&quot; or my programming potential.</i>  To add to the irony, about 2/3rds of my current co-workers know that I&#x27;m looking for a job and they regularly make comments to me about how much they don&#x27;t want me to go, followed by comments about understanding my need to work in a less toxic environment.",1420813653

You need a cleartext password at some point, otherwise the user can&#x27;t send anything to you.<p>The best practice for security is to not <i>store</i> passwords in cleartext. You can certainly perform extremely limited actions on passwords in cleartext (like hash checking), and you inevitably have to.<p>Which brings me to my overall point - as the Facebook security team has explained before on their whitehat page, you do not practically reduce security by allowing caps lock inversion to check a hash.<p>What you&#x27;re saying about Facebook having an abnormal process also isn&#x27;t true either - Facebook does one of two things, both of which are secure:<p>1. Stores two hashes for each password, one the real password and the other the case inverted, or<p>2. Checks a password against a hash, and inverts the case and checks again if it fails.<p>There is nothing about this which is different from normal password transmission in cleartext, and Facebook doesn&#x27;t store the cleartext password you send them.<p>EDIT to your EDIT:<p>No, no no no no, no. Don&#x27;t do clientside things like that. Allowing a user to directly manipulate something as major as whether or not their password is hashed before it is sent to you is bad. It doesn&#x27;t even matter that it&#x27;s just them hacking themselves; it&#x27;s just bad form to put that in their browsers&#x27; hands. Plus, a stored cross-site scripting error that went viral on the login page pre-auth could screw your password database, leading to a layup for mass cleartext password compromise. Or in a worse scenario, you&#x27;re giving a user direct write access (and then maybe reads) to the password database.<p>It&#x27;s much safer to do the industry best practice of destroying cleartext sensitive information upon successful hash.<p>Say no to clientside security. There are arguments for hashing clientside, but they can all be summed up by &quot;You shouldn&#x27;t let people potentially sniff users&#x27; passwords&quot; - if you implement TLS/SSL correctly, this won&#x27;t be an issue and the cleartext password will exist briefly, then get destroyed.<p>The one other argument is that someone could compromise the server handling the hashing process and write a script watching all the passwords. But this isn&#x27;t a valid concern - if someone has backdoored your login server, it <i>no longer matters if passwords are cleartext</i> for the damage they&#x27;ll do. The level of difficulty you introduce by having passwords hashed originally becomes moot at that point.<p>Finally, consider that a client-side hash of a password sent to a server becomes the effective password for that user, not the <i>hash of the password.</i> This means that, effectively, if no other action is done at the server, you&#x27;re actually then storing the password in plaintext. If a user was MITM&#x27;d while sending the password, the hash can now be sent directly to the server in place of the user&#x27;s password, because it is the de facto password.<p>The bottomline: client-side hashing offers no real addition to overall security posture under TLS/SSL, and removes most of the benefit of hashing.",1420812636

8862227,comment,8860738,8861644,0,0,TheRealDunkirk,,,"> merely the symptoms of the deeper problem which is the US constitution.<p>I think the history of the US clearly shows that The Constitution isn&#x27;t the source of our problems. We&#x27;re not following it! Our elected leaders have stretched its definitions past the breaking point, and our judiciary has allowed those stretches to become law.<p>You allude to states having a veto because of the Senate, but that&#x27;s precisely what was _supposed_ to happen, when the state nominated their own Senators. The popular election of Senators effectively took states out of the equation. A particularly awkward situation, given that the UNITED STATES was FOUNDED to be a nation of sovereign states. But that was the question answered by our Civil War: we became a single nation with what are effectively a bunch of local bureaucracies, instead of a federation of states, with a federal government that existed for the &quot;common defense&quot; and international relations. The relatively-recent show on Lincoln (I forget the name) was good at illuminating the Constitutional crisis created by the Emancipation Proclamation, and the authority ceded to the Executive branch has done nothing but snowball since then.<p>And don&#x27;t get me started with the abuses of the &quot;Commerce Clause.&quot; I defy anyone reading to give me ONE area (of SIGNIFICANCE) in their personal, DAILY lives that isn&#x27;t legislated by the FEDERAL government. I&#x27;ve thrown this question out before, and one person gave me a good answer, but those examples are tough to come up with.<p>Two things are killing the US political system: our 2-party system, and campaign contributions. First, let&#x27;s break up the DNC and the GOP into sub-factions to get the ball rolling. There&#x27;s plenty of room in both parties. This should allow other folks from the Green and the Libertarian and the Rastafarian parties to run on more-even footing.<p>Second, all elected officials should get a set amount of money from the government itself to run a campaign. The money should vary according to state or federal levels, and on which seat is sought, but it should be the same for everyone seeking that seat. It can even be a lot of money! They don&#x27;t even have to be particularly accountable for it! It still wouldn&#x27;t even budge the budget needle. And then just get rid of PAC&#x27;s entirely.<p>The money-for-votes system we have now has got to go. I&#x27;m like a desperate used car salesman on this point. &quot;Any offer will be considered!&quot; Any idea how to get special interests segregated from our system would be good. When you have top-level politicians admitting that they spend 80% of their time trying to raise money for the next election, starting on the first day of the term, you know something has to change. But, since &quot;they&quot; control the system, &quot;they&quot; are not going to allow anything to disrupt the process.<p>You seem to be praising &quot;the Dems&quot; for their efforts, and the ACA in particular, but you can&#x27;t point to a better example of the inmates running the asylum that that piece of legislation, written by Congress-owning health industry lobbyists, and passed by a Congress without anyone having even read it. That&#x27;s NOT how it was supposed to be done. That&#x27;s as un-Constitutional a &quot;thing&quot; that has happened as anything in recent memory, and another perfect example of how campaign contributions (or the threat of their discontinuance) has broken our system.",1420812152

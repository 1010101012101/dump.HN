With Live Mesh you not only can access your 'share' from anywhere you can also remote login to your home PC from anywhere and vice versa (yeah access office PC from home even across firewall).",1232195425

There were also interesting link to the wired article on the point of view of the UN, a link to the use of White phosphore during the irak war.\nAnd, most importantly there wasn't any flame war (except between maybe between those who think that there can't be any constructive dialogue and those who think that there can be)....<p>Now, of course, I'm usually more interested in articles about startups, software, business and science but I also like Hacker news because I find the discussion interesting and the people well read. And reading the different points of view of people here on such a topic is interesting (as long as we don't get articles about Gaza every day, it's nice and as said it _is_ an important topic)",1232194878

What country is your primary consumer?<p>3. What is the intersection between facebook users and the two questions above?<p>4. Based on whatever statistics you can find - how many users get turned away because of sign-up problems?<p>5. How many consumers will your initial marketing push reach - i.e, the consumers you hope to gain in the period when you don't have hard feature choices to make?<p>Intersect those 5 criteria and estimate what the benefit of facebook connect will be. You may want to contrast it with the benefits of the other features. Understand your numbers before spending time on stuff.",1232193872

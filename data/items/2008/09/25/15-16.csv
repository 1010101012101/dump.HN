And it's true that this particular feature in C++ has led to creation of many interesting techniques - auto-pointer, scope locking, to name a few - that otherwise would require full support on the compiler side. The beauty of C++ is that you can implement this kind of things yourself without changing the language.",1222357297

314901,comment,314294,314846,0,0,raganwald,,,"Well, my personal opinion's that Apple are harming their platform in this matter as well. I know for a fact that many developers are shunning the platform because of actions like this. As a matter of fact, I shun developing directly for the platform because of similar actions in the past, like giving iTunes away and driving all the payware music players out of business. Or building the dashboard and driving Konfabulator over to Windows.<p>However, I stand by my assertion that given Apple's history and given the fact that there was an NDA in place when the book project was begun, there is no sympathy to give out here, nor is there any surprising ""Who would have thought Apple would do this?"" news.<p>In fact, nothing has changed since the NDA was first revealed. I say again, it will be newsworthy when the restrictions are lifted. Until then, it is like telling the world that Steve Jobs is tyrannical and abusive to his employees.",1222356200

Alternatively the company could have an account where you transfer money to.

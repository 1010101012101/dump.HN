4642998,comment,4642420,4642982,1,0,tokenadult,,,"<i>The US education system is fine compared to those of Europe and Asia.</i><p>The factual statement is incorrect as to results of instruction, and the statement is well known to be incorrect by any widely traveled person who has studied the educational system in multiple countries, especially those who have made specific study of typical school textbooks and teaching methods in various countries.<p>Anyway, the links offered in support of your prima-facie false statement are not written by a person who is familiar with United States education and have been called out before here on Hacker News as crap links, contrary to<p><a href=""http://ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html</a><p>""Essentially there are two rules here: don't post or upvote crap links, and don't be rude or dumb in comment threads.""<p>AFTER EDIT: As I go out to take my son to his soccer practice, it occurs to me that the factual assumption in the grandparent comment needs examination as well. It IS a fact that schools are quite well funded in the United States compared to how they are funded in other countries. School funding in the United States is quite uneven from region to region, but in almost all regions is well above world averages, and some United States schools receive more dollars per pupil than schools nearly anywhere. So my statement about the RESULTS of schools in the United States should be interpreted as a statement that United States schools disappoint compared to what a large percentage of public funds are devoted to them. Many countries do better in that regard of efficiency. To the point of the submitted article, one fiscal overhang that older generations of school employees are leaving for younger generations of pupils and students is large pension obligations for those school employees, which are far from fully funded in most states, and are very lavish by worldwide standards.<p>SECOND EDIT: The ball is in your court this time, yummyfajitas. I invite the readers of HN to determine whether you have ever been a straight shooter on this issue any of the many times you have submitted that crap link. I'm not aware that you have done any of the travel or reading necessary to evaluate the statements in those links accurately. Let's ask lots of HN participants to take a close look at the actual evidence on education peformance per dollar expended in different countries and think carefully about how well the United States is really doing. (My user profile, which readers can view in my absence from this discussion, explains some of my basis for knowledge for why I say the United States school system does not do as well as it ought to do.)",1349992479

Under ""primary cause analysis"" on page 18 of the report (pg 24 of the pdf) it says that they may have actually been related:<p>In summary, after the right engine failed due to fuel ingestion, the left engine had to push some air over to the non-functioning engine (for cooling I assume but it isn't stated). When the left engine afterburner did not light, it's ""relight logic"" did not trigger possibly because of the lower air amount. So the engineer who wrote the relight logic, assumed that the temperature would drop at a certain rate when the afterburner failed to light. Because the engine was working to assist the failed engine, that temperature drop did not happen and thus the afterburner did not attempt to automatically relight itself.<p>Sounds like it may be dependent after all.",1349992396

4642990,comment,4642420,4642420,2,0,tokenadult,,,"I think this article has been submitted before. (The submission here is not a submission of the canonical URL.) Anyway, by the usual generation labeling in the United States, the most profligate generation in United States history is the ""Silent Generation,"" the generation mostly born during the Great Depression (who make up the parent generation of the younger half of the Baby Boom). They began and sustained the trend of spending far in advance of revenue, all the while thinking that they ""earned"" their government transfer payments. I, a Baby Boomer, have a higher retirement age than my parents have, and have paid a higher rate of payroll or self-employment taxes into Social Security than my parents generally did.<p>But the submitted article is correct that the older generations in the United States will have to rethink their attitude toward ""entitlements"" (transfer payments) even more if our children's generation is to have any prospect of continued economic growth. On my part, I'm happy to see my retirement age nudged up some more, and also for old-age benefits and other government benefits to take actual cuts (rather than merely decreases in their rate of increase over time) to make sure that they are funded on an actuarially sound basis. I vote like that, and I discuss the issue with my generation-mates in these terms. The older should be helping the younger, in general, not the other way around.",1349992362

It's not supposed to have agency of its own, people are.<p>Besides, you can't take it with you into the next world.  So why not confiscate your wealth when you're too dead to use it?  Why not confiscate the ill-gotten gains of capitalists even before they die ;-)?<p><i>Our (U.S.) tax code is absolutely horrible, but even with that revenue isn't the problem, spending is. I would say that politicians will ALWAYS spend every dime they have, but in reality they spend money they dont have.</i><p>This theory sounds intelligent only by dint of sheer cynicism, and entirely fails to explain the Clinton budget surpluses.",1349991760

The clients who pay more tend to get more value from your work.<p>So <i>at any point</i> the clients you have that are willing to pay more are generally better clients (for you and for them). So if you raise your rates and only support those clients you get a set of better clients who are going to be happier with your work, and give you more money.<p>Those clients, in turn, allow you to find similar good clients. Through recommendation and marketing for those clients. So you grow your set of good clients.<p>You'll then find a subset of <i>those</i> will be willing to pay more - because you provide more value for them.<p>Repeat. You will find that some of the work you do changes radically - at least in the way you sell it - during this period.<p>Raising rates isn't (just) about extracting the most money from your clients as possible. It's a way to help you find the clients who you will serve best - and because of that they're more than happy to pay you more.<p>To answer your end questions (and this is a little bit unfair since this is the second time I've started my own consultancy so have probably moved through the levels a bit faster this time - and I have a very strong idea of where my value-niche is).<p>If normal hourly is $x to $y - then I very deliberately started at $y just under 2.5 year ago (I very much do <i>not</i> want the clients who want the cheapest possible solution - learned that lesson ten years back ;-).<p>Currently my effective hourly rate (I don't actually charge by the hour any more so clients never see that number) is about what my day rate was when I started - so about 1:8, 1:9... something like that.

The fact you can live most of your life with a growing asset that is untaxed (just hold stocks and live off the dividends, for instance), vs actually having to pay taxes on the value of something is a benefit for the wealthy already.  Letting them pass on this tax benefit is ridiculous.<p>Also, if someone buys say an apartment complex, using depreciation for their tax benefit, then dies and leaves it to an heir, the heir generally receives a favorable tax benefit since the asset gets a step-up in cost basis, whereas if the original person sold the asset, they'd have to then pay the taxes from the profit and the depreciation they took over the years.<p>The tax code is already heavily weighted to favor the wealthy, allowing people to amass great wealth without having to contribute it back to society is very short-sighted.

Implement an optional filter for the ratings so that it will show with five stars the range from 4* to 5*.
4.0-4.2 - one star (1.0-4.0 is also one star)
4.2-4.4 - two stars
...
4.8-5.0 - five stars
This is because most people can't comprehend how to rate generally good things but which are not perfect on the absolute scale. Relative scale is an even harder concept.<p>This method won't help of course so in the future you'll need to distinguish so people as ""experts"" (this is a human task, it can't be awarded statistically - by a number of reviews or anything similar). After that implement separate rating for them.<p>Even that won't fix biased reviews but will mitigate them considerably. The task of implementing good rankings is a very hard one.",1349989711

Your app can use up only a relatively small part. More accurately, each component (Activity, Service, etc.) of your app  with the <process> attribute can only use up to 48MB. Usually, all your components are in one process.<p>Within your process, Android will ""destroy"" (null all references) to components in your process and recreate them to optimize memory use. At times, Android will destroy every component in a process and delete ane re-create whole processes from the saved state of each component. This explains why PIDs are not reliable for tracking android app resource use. Your tasks (the components on the back stack starting with the task root, which is the component that was launched by the Launcher) are not tied to one process, nor one PID, throughout their lifespan.",1349989450

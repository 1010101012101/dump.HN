7281705,comment,7279965,7280729,1,0,aleem,,,"WhatsApp is much better than Skype as an acquisition.<p>1. It&#x27;s a single-purpose, specialised application which makes it hard to compete against. Once you can&#x27;t subtract anymore from a software you are left with the essence of it. If you build that rock-solid you can eliminate any competitive threat on the product front. Kind of like unix utilities.<p>2. On the network front they played smartly by going after your phone book which makes them network agnostic (Skype, FB, Google, iMessage, BBM are all stuck within their own walls). At this point WhatsApp can just sit back and let network-effects do the work (they have spent 0 on marketing to date).<p>Between 1 & 2, competing with WhatsApp is hard and they are resilient to disruption. That&#x27;s a great relief for any tech acquisition.<p>Another thing I like about WhatsApp is that they didn&#x27;t do a whole lot other than fixing SMS. They did this by adding group messaging and reducing costs. And for now at least, I don&#x27;t get any marketing spam on WhatsApp like I do over SMS.<p>Skype&#x27;s shelf life was always questionable to me. It was and will remain relatively easier to disrupt.",1393066506

The young proof readers could actually get the markdown code and correct my mistakes there (or write comments, starting with another fixme). really rocked with diff.<p>The older proofreaders could proofread it in the final stage in ms word with the track changes functionality.<p>I put a lot of thought into Design and Typography and i was sure that i could decide better how my document should look, than latex.\nI agree, that for some people this is not the case.",1393066370

I agree with you for the most part.<p>This whole &quot;it&#x27;s apples to oranges&quot; claim is bullshit. Both Word as well as LaTeX can be used for anything from writing a resume, making a technical paper with a few simple equations, to writing an entire Vector or Linear Algebra textbooks. When you have two options for doing the same task it&#x27;s very much comparing apples to apples.<p>Yes, they each were originally built with different objectives and different target markets, but they have since aspired to be usable for all the same things. Of course, they each have their strengths and weaknesses.<p>But I don&#x27;t get how do a bunch of folk here feel justified in arguing against someone saying &quot;there&#x27;s room for improvement&quot; with clear viable suggestions on the details too. I know that hating on MSWord (or MS-anything) is fashionable on HN. But you can&#x27;t seriously be defending<p>* the steep learning curve: throw your 14-year-old who&#x27;s doing a math assignment Word vs your favourite LaTeX editor, see what happens;<p>* lack of WYSIWYG-like feedback-loops: you have to wait a full minute on decently sized documents to see the result of adding that equation that took you 10 seconds to add;<p>* syntax holdups: you miss an underscore and your document is broken. All the way through. And can take an hour to fix even if you&#x27;re skilled. People writing documents that need LaTeX&#x27;s power aren&#x27;t always coders, and debugging is not a fun or planned-for activity for anyone.<p>I also don&#x27;t for the life of me see why someone has to &quot;be an expert, not just written a couple documents casually in undergrad&quot; to be able to comment on the flaws of a product. They&#x27;re as much a user as a power user, and obviously the power users went through that stage too. Losing sight of your past difficulties (or being gifted in LaTeX) doesn&#x27;t make them irrelevant for people not in your current position.<p>Loosely relevant: I smell hardcore &quot;hacker entitlement&quot; around people using LaTeX and defending it including all its stupid barriers to easy document-creation tooth and nail.

I've been seeing it all day on Twitter: VCs ecstatic about Tumblr's ""successful exit"", they're done and can now go home and drink champagne.<p>But the problem is not with Tumblr being a blog full of porn and cat GIFs, running out of money, having 175 employees most of which do little, and making $15M vs. $100M projected revenue. The problem is with the state of the industry as a whole.<p>The problem is with a company like Yahoo! rushing to get a deal done for a company that would be worth $100M in 6-months when it runs out of money. It just doesn't make sense. But maybe it's not supposed to.<p>Warner Chilcott is obviously a company that tries to do good and create products to better humanity (for the most part), and I'm not saying that Tumblr is worthless - it isn't - but the madness behind the media, the Yahoo! board meeting on a Sunday to get a deal done before Captain Zuckerberg swoops in (I'm sure he's laughing and could care less) is maddening.<p>This isn't a rant, it's more of a ""what the hell is going on with companies and innovation  of substance?""

Essentially, IRLS gives outliers and/or influential [1] data points less weight, which may improve the performance of the overall model since these outliers/influential data would otherwise cause assumption violations using classical regression. If there are no outliers, then results from robust and classical regression converge.<p>I would disagree with SagelyGuru in recommending robust regression for non-statisticians, though I can see where he or she is coming from. With robust regression, you don't have to worry as much about assumptions as with classical regression. But with robust regression, you need to be aware that the underlying analytical method is different and what that means. For example, the standard robust regression implementation in R (i.e, the rlm function in the MASS package) doesn't produce t-statistics or p-values. There're also warnings that especially at lower sample sizes, the standard errors produced by rlm may be unreliable. One recommended way to obtain those p-values would be to get bootstrapped standard error estimates, so that normal-theory approximation would apply.<p>[1] There are different types of robust estimators (e.g., M, S, MM, etc.) that have different robustness properties.",1369085690

You take care of the people by enabling them to not worry about the basics of life.  You remove the survival problem from the game, and allow people to choose between living little or thriving through voluntary creative pursuits.  Some people will certainly focus on the creative pursuits, and generate wealth that enables them to thrive instead of merely survive.  But I have a feeling that a bunch of people will focus on their tennis game instead (which is fine with me).<p>I don't think most people yet realize that this sort of model is coming into humanity's reach.  Most people are looking for ways to recreate the solutions of the past.  But that's a horrible idea-- the past had problems because the solutions of the past create problems.  We're almost on the verge of a technological/humanistic revolution in which everything will be changeable.  But things won't change if we keep recreating the past (or, more accurately, if our ancient social structures keep trying to maintain control of the population by merely tweaking what are actually completely obsolete mechanisms).<p>I hope we can overcome the status quo and turn this world into a true utopia, instead of letting it continue to become yet another of the countless possible dystopias that are outlined by science fiction and other speculative fiction, and which have constituted the dystopian reality that most people ever born here have had to live through.<p>I'm very optimistic-- I think the hard part is mostly behind us.  The social power structures (the institutions that use money, violence, and killing to control people) have not routinely killed scientist and engineer society-changers for probably several hundred years, at least in the West.

If there  is anyone other than workers at these companies who create wealth nowadays, it is the users.  The users of Facebook are creating the content of Facebook for free.  The people working on Facebook are the ones who create the platform allowing them to do this.  You can say the same with Google and web content.  Google found a way to take the decentralized web, with contentual links thought of by humans, and centralize it in one place.  People thinking how to contextually connect millions of web pages do the work, and Google crawls and amalgamates that.<p>And as is said here, and is true, it costs almost nothing in capital costs to start a startup nowadays, create an app, get a cloud presence etc.  Wages are the main cost.  The people doing the work create the wealth, either paid (infrastructure) or even unpaid (free content, free contextual links etc.)<p>jwz is someone who ""hit the jackpot"" with his options, yet even he saw up close what happens ( <a href=""http://www.jwz.org/blog/2011/11/watch-a-vc-use-my-name-to-sell-a-con"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jwz.org/blog/2011/11/watch-a-vc-use-my-name-to-se...</a> ).  I would quote the relevant part of his blog post here, but all nine paragraphs could be quoted, really.<p>The main point is, the programmers create the wealth making the platform, and perhaps the people working for free uploading content like pictures, or getting their web sites crawled.  The money goes to the VCs, and a little bit of it to the CEO and top execs.  Even those that hit the jackpot at a Netscape don't really hit the jackpot.  And these are the programmers who slept under their desks and made the killer product.  What about the guy in the Midwest?<p>Organized labor allowed an equitable distribution of wealth.  VCs are leeching off the US government, the universities of China and India, the high tech workers here etc.  How is some heir putting his millions in some fund creating wealth?  We create the wealth.  The heir is a leech.  Like the kids in the ""Born Rich"" documentary.<p>New technology can mean less hours for workers, more pay for workers etc.  Instead it goes to the aristocracy.<p>Modes of production change and so does the organization of labor.  Workers in Ancient Rome went on strike, and I remember the strike waves in the US in the 1970s.  Things change over the millenia, but these notions labor will stop organizing circa now are silly.  It hasn't stopped after all these millenia.  We are the programmers, system/network/database admins etc. creating this wealth of all the people in the world, and as jwz points out, even when we hit the jackpot we get screwed.  Production is changing but there will be a revival of organization, education and then agitation.  What happened before in history will happen again.  It's to the oligarchs advantage to tell us all these millenia of struggle have finally stopped in the past few years.  It hasn't.  And we are the ones in the most key positions to do something.

If the price/performance optimum lies further back than that, it may well have fallen at a point in time when AMD / NVidia were closer to price/performance parity.<p>To clarify, by ""performance"" I mean ""performance for my needs"" which means ""double precision float performance.""<p>> Also, what's wrong with NVidia's GPGPU capabilities?<p>The price per double-precision FLOP was off by a factor of four at the consumer level last time I went shopping and the number of DFLOPS available at the consumer level was capped lower.

One way to reduce the constraint is to reduce the cost.<p>Some of the biggest cost for the average American household is housing(34.1%), food(12.4%), and transportation(17.6%). <a href=""http://visualeconomics.creditloan.com/how-the-average-us-consumer-spends-their-paycheck/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://visualeconomics.creditloan.com/how-the-average-us-con...</a><p>Housing is mostly a regulatory or social issue. People do not need lawns or lot of space. There is a tendency for people to buy the biggest house they can afford. It's also because of zoning restrictions that prevent high density construction, and developer's disinterest in cheap housing. High standard building code obviously contributes to the cost of engineering and developing housing, but they are solvable through technological development. There's also the problem of the network effect and the economy of scale of high density constructions leading to more people emigrating to the city, increasing the demand for housing.<p>Food, on the other hand, are easily leveraged with technological development, especially with GM crops. Growing meat in factories will be much more efficient and ethical than growing complete organisms like cows or chickens. Food wastage is a major problem. In the US, half of the food is wasted. If somebody could solve the problem of food wastage, that mean a corresponding reduction in the food budget of the average American and perhaps the world. <a href=""http://www.foodproductiondaily.com/Supply-Chain/Half-of-US-food-goes-to-waste"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.foodproductiondaily.com/Supply-Chain/Half-of-US-f...</a><p>In the future of transportation, electric will be the primary mean of transportation except rockets as they are much more efficient than ICE and have a lower total cost of ownership. The question is merely about how fast can we diffuse the technology. Governments around the world can help by taxing carbon emitting transportations as opposed to subsidizing the electric startups, which could be seen as political favoritism. We could also drive the cost down by making public transportation better and widespread, accelerating the development of self driving cars, and reduce traffic rush hours by implementing congestion charges.<p>Overall, the toughest challenge is definitely housing, because housing appears to be least amicable to technological leverage. However, if you can make headway into the biggest cost to the average household, our need to work in order to live will be drastically reduced.",1369084331

Protobufs were, in a lot of ways, one response.<p>The key takeaway for me from that time, and going forward, was that distributed services are effectively messages in flight. The more messages in flight, the more combinations of arrival times, the fewer messages in flight, the less scaling. This became what is known as the CAP theorem.

For things where the data set mutates along a path (imagine a state machine of 'n' states, where its 'path' is the sequence of states it is in between time 0 and time t) if correctness is a function of the path then you have a lot harder time of it.

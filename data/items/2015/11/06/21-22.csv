The waters are also muddied a bit in that they have their Xamarin.Forms library now which is an abstraction layer over top of the native components (but at the end of the chain, still defers to the native components to actually do the work). It&#x27;s easy to confuse Xamarin.Forms with a non-native toolkit, but it too is just a wrapper over top native tools.",1446847169

10522336,comment,10518507,10518507,0,0,mbrock,,,"Very interesting. The demo on pp 376 looks useful.<p>From the conclusion:<p>> The British Nationality Act 1981 has also proved to be a rich source of problems for the use of logic for knowledge representation. It has highlighted problems with negation as failure and counterfactual conditions in particular. We believe that the formalization of legislation and the development of computer systems to assist with legal problem solving and decision making provide a rich domain for developing and testing artificial intelligence technology. More tentatively, the accumulated experience of managing complex systems of law may teach us something about the maintenance of large bodies of complex software.<p>Here&#x27;s another paper by one of the authors, &quot;Legislation as Logic Programs&quot; from 1991: <a href=""http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~rak/papers/law.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~rak/papers/law.html</a><p>> In addition to the resemblance between legislation and programs, the law has other important similarities with computing.  It needs for example to validate legislation against social and political specifications, and it needs to organise, develop, maintain and reuse large and complex bodies of legal codes and procedures.  Such parallels between computing and law suggest that it might be possible to transfer useful results and techniques in both directions between these different fields.  One possibility explored in this paper is that the linguistic structures of an appropriately extended logic programming language might indicate ways in which the language of legislation itself could be made simpler and clearer.",1446847096

Shocking, isn&#x27;t it?<p>If they want to make an apples-for-apples comparison, the author should come to the UK and compare our 1890 semi-detached with any post-70s new-build.

Video games, HN/FB/email checking and nicotine - all cause neurotransmitter release. That&#x27;s what makes them addictive.

People quit nicotine (i stopped smoking 13 years ago after a decade of enjoying pack-a-day and i think all this &quot;nicotine addiction&quot; is almost non-existent thing, a scarecrow elephant that tobacco companies inflated out of a small fly to scare people from quitting) while people can&#x27;t quit video games or the other Internet related activities once they got hooked up on it, ie. once the addiction got developed by establishing stimuli->dopamine reward cycle in the brain for that specific stimuli like the video game or HN comments.",1446845879

Why?  Because it used to be much cheaper to hire skilled labor than it is today.  You can see a similar trend every year in the Christmas Price Index, which tracks the cost of the items in the 12 Days of Christmas song.  The prices of goods tend to stay stable, while the price of labor tends to increase significantly.<p>For our brick buildings, I tried to find the best numbers I could, and here&#x27;s what I came up with:\nIn 1894, bricks cost about $5.70/thousand [1], which is $165.51 in today&#x27;s dollars\nToday, you can get bricks wholesale for $220/thousand - and that&#x27;s what I found online, I imagine an actual wholesaler is less. [2]\nThat&#x27;s an increase of about 37%<p>For the bricklayer, the average wage in 1891 was $4/day, which is about $110 in today&#x27;s dollars [3]<p>Today, the median bricklayer pay is $24/hour [4], which is $192 per 8 hour day.<p>That&#x27;s an increase of 75% in the real wages of the bricklayer, and it means that the rate labor costs have increased is double the rate of material costs.<p>In 1891, it may have made financial sense to pay for a bricklayer to make intricate, high quality buildings.  In the past few decades, it&#x27;s likely that&#x27;s no longer the case.<p>[1] <a href=""https://books.google.com/books?id=Oo4oAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA953&lpg=PA953&dq=average+price+brick+1891&source=bl&ots=GcEOPaUc51&sig=NleYQCrOeeo04wtGQazDrf-4WFc&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CB0Q6AEwAGoVChMIyoCb_tn8yAIViiomCh07oAPV#v=onepage&q=average%20price%20brick%201891&f=false"" rel=""nofollow"">https://books.google.com/books?id=Oo4oAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA953&lpg=...</a><p>[2]<a href=""http://brickbroker.com/brick.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://brickbroker.com/brick.html</a>\n[3] <a href=""https://books.google.com/books?id=cNdEAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA722&lpg=PA722&dq=wage+bricklayer+1891&source=bl&ots=yl05RZTmSC&sig=ezss_Em2mx16u76THQi7eTaR8xY&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CCsQ6AEwA2oVChMIqIWbodr8yAIVTOImCh3fKQED#v=onepage&q=bricklayer&#x27;s%20wages&f=false"" rel=""nofollow"">https://books.google.com/books?id=cNdEAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA722&lpg=...</a>\n[4] <a href=""http://www.payscale.com/research/US/Job=Bricklayer/Hourly_Rate"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.payscale.com/research/US/Job=Bricklayer/Hourly_Ra...</a>",1446845363

And no matter how many times this gets linked to on the Internet, it&#x27;s still wrong.<p>The basic problem: the quieter a sound or detail gets, the fewer bits of resolution are used to represent it.<p>In 16-bit recording, there simply aren&#x27;t enough bits to represent very low level details without distorting them with a subtle but audible crunchy digital halo of quantisation noise.<p>In a 24-bit recording, there are.<p>Talking about dynamic range completely misses the point. It&#x27;s the not the absolute difference between the loudest and quietest sounds that matters - it&#x27;s the accuracy with which the quieter sounds are reproduced.<p>This is because in a studio, 0dB full-scale meter redline is calibrated to a standard voltage reference, and both consumer and professional audio has equivalent standard levels for the loudest level possible.<p><i>These levels don&#x27;t change for different bit depths</i>, and they&#x27;re used on both analog and digital equipment. (In fact they&#x27;ve been standard for decades now.)<p>This is why using more bits does not mean you can &quot;reproduce music with a bigger dynamic range&quot; - not without turning the volume up, anyway.<p>What actually happens is that the maximum possible volume of a playback system stays the same, but quieter sounds are reproduced with more or less accuracy.<p>In a 16-bit recording quiet sounds below around 50Db have 1-8 bits of effective resolution, which is nowhere near enough for truly accurate reproduction. (Try listening to an 8-bit recording to hear what this means.)<p>You might think it doesn&#x27;t matter because they&#x27;re quiet. Not so. 50dB is a long way from being inaudible, ears can be incredibly good at spectral estimation, and your brain parses spectral content and volume as separate things.<p>There&#x27;s a wide range between &quot;loud enough to hear&quot; and &quot;too loud&quot; and 24-bit covers that whole range accurately. 16-bit is fine for louder sounds, but the quieter details just above &quot;loud enough to get hear&quot; get audibly bit-crushed.<p>The effect isn&#x27;t glaringly disturbing, and adding dither helps make it even less obvious. But it&#x27;s still there.<p>24-bit doesn&#x27;t need tricks like dither - because it does the job properly in the first place.<p>Now - whether or not commercial recordings have enough musical detail to take full advantage of 24-bits is a different question. For various reasons - compression, mastering, cheapness - many don&#x27;t.<p>But if you have any kind of aural sensitivity, you really should be able to A/B the difference between a 24-bit uncompressed orchestral recording and a 16-bit recording using an otherwise identical studio-grade mixer/mike/recorder/speaker system without too much difficulty.",1446845168

The relapse to previous use levels isn&#x27;t that different.<p>A huge factor in how &quot;bad&quot; each is however seems to be in the responses to relapse. There&#x27;s disapproval in people&#x27;s responses to someone taking up nicotine again, but if someone is back to drinking coffee, there&#x27;s at most a &quot;oh drinking coffee again bob?&quot;. These factors in the consequences regarding a slip up or relapse make it hard to judge how &quot;addictive&quot; something is independent of the socialization of it.

One of my servers runs NixOS, and I am a big proponent of declarative programming in general but functional programming in particular. There are of course MASSIVE BENEFITS to declarative package management, I myself use Puppet and Boxen to manage my development environment. I don&#x27;t think I denied that? I was just saying that in my experience the people who are able to see the practical benefits are functional programmers in large part due to their prior experience with declarative programming. I&#x27;m speaking from my experience with the NixOS community that a much greater proportion of its users are functional programmers than probably any other OS.<p>Maybe the same isn&#x27;t true for Guix. I don&#x27;t know. However, I do have to contest got point about free software. Yes, it&#x27;s extremely important, but it&#x27;s also true for every GNU project. I know it&#x27;s free software because it&#x27;s a GNU project, not because they told me at the top of their website. It&#x27;s their brand. It&#x27;s like if Apple put &quot;Bauhaus-esque minimalist design&quot; at the top of every product page. It&#x27;s their brand. Now I don&#x27;t expect the FSF to be very aware of their brand identity, but that&#x27;s not a good thing and if you think it really needs to be said that Guix is a free software project when it&#x27;s hosted on gnu.org I&#x27;m not sure why we&#x27;re having this conversation.<p>Perhaps buzzwords was the wrong word. Yes, I understand that these concepts are nontrivial. In fact, I understand it well because I do grok them, and that&#x27;s part of why I&#x27;m able to say that it&#x27;s very daunting for a newcomer to see all of those words and not understand what they mean. This hews very close to the free software tradition of &quot;if you don&#x27;t understand this immediately you don&#x27;t deserve to be here&quot; which is a toxic attitude that needs to be eliminated. At the very least, it looks clumsy and more than anything else it&#x27;s abundantly clear that the writer of those words has forgotten what it&#x27;s like to be a newbie.<p>I don&#x27;t think they should redirect to Nix, far from it. It&#x27;s a different project. That&#x27;s simply irrational. I meant to imply that I was surprised that their site sucked so bad when their project is downstream from a project with one of the best homepages I&#x27;ve ever seen for a free software venture. And no, the casual users don&#x27;t need to know about Nix, but if it&#x27;s important that the name be an homage to it should it not at least be mentioned?<p>Yes, I&#x27;m completely aware of the difference between Scheme and Haskell, and I know what Guile is or I wouldn&#x27;t have clicked on this thread in the first place. (a decision I&#x27;m rapidly beginning to regret)<p>The bottom line is that there are simpler and more lucid alternative ways of saying what they want to say there and it&#x27;s not for want of examples that they don&#x27;t. Good artists copy, great artists steal, as the saying goes. They should be great artists and alter their design to reflect principles that are obvious in the design of nixos.org. Or alternatively, since their project is a derivative, they could ask the Nix maintainers if they could use some of the look and feel.<p>And it is absolutely a Guile front end to the Nix system, this is completely uncontroversial and expressed clearly in their readme:<p>&quot;GNU Guix is Nix[0] from Guile[1]!<p>Concretely, it allows Nix package management to be done entirely in\nScheme. The goal is to investigate whether Scheme, and in particular\nthe ability to define EDSLs, would allow it to fulfill the role of the\nNix language.&quot;<p>&quot;* How It Works<p>Guix does the high-level preparation of a /derivation/.  A derivation is\nthe promise of a build; it is stored as a text file under\n=/nix/store/xxx.drv=.  The (guix derivations) module provides the\n`derivation&#x27; primitive, as well as higher-level wrappers such as\n`build-expression->derivation&#x27;.<p>Guix does remote procedure calls (RPCs) to the Nix daemon (the\n=nix-worker --daemon= command), which in turn performs builds and\naccesses to the Nix store on its behalf.  The RPCs are implemented in\nthe (guix store) module.&quot;<p>It builds from the Nix package archive, it works by communicating with the Nix daemon, it wouldn&#x27;t exist without Nix.<p>I&#x27;m not sure how else I can express this, you spent your entire post trying to prove that I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m talking about by repeating concepts I am intimately familiar with.<p>There are absolutely short ways to explain the nontrivial concepts, and NixOS does it well.",1446843834

I agree with you from a financial perspective, but it&#x27;s just more complicated (for all kinds of dumb reasons).<p>A) Publicity.  Do you want good headlines or bad headlines from the IPO?<p>B) Secondary sales: It&#x27;s kind of silly, but if / when you go to sell more shares the people who have made money are more likely to buy (against all logic) because some of them think of the money they made as a cushion against losses.<p>C) Banks want to please their customers.  Think of this as part of the fee for the IPO.  Typical underwriting fees are 7%, but they could be 10%, all arbitrary, but they basically charge some extra points that they choose to give to their clients in the form of IPO allocation for continued business.<p>D) Those same banks in (C) might be the people who help the executives moves large blocks of stock in the future (not easy to sell 10 million shares of a company without having large price impact).  Executives in particular want a good relationship with their underwriters and if they&#x27;re too aggressive on price they might not get it.<p>Agreed that none of these are super compelling, especially for a very long-term owner like Zuckerberg.",1446843768

It still survives in a few backward places like North Korea but it&#x27;s now obsolete. It&#x27;s not something we need to fear.<p>The new fascism is kind and gentle. It doesn&#x27;t arrest you, beat you, electrocute you, draft you into the army, or kill you. Instead it surveils you, models you, and gently nudges you into doing the Right Thing as determined by a benevolent class of philosopher kings.<p>The new fascism only wants good things. It wants lower unemployment, higher GDP, better education, health, welfare, less crime, cleaner cities. Who doesn&#x27;t want those things? Who wants more filth and violence? Who wants people to be unemployed? Only bad people oppose the new fascism, and who wants to be a bad person?<p>Interesting times indeed. Plato would be proud. Of course all this is well-trodden territory in sci-fi and fantasy. Fiction is full of gleaming utopias with a dark secret. But that&#x27;s fiction, right, and fiction isn&#x27;t reality.

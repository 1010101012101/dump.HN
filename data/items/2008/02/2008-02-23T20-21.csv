This series is really good at getting the basics down clearly and quickly (I read through it in under a week).  After that, Dive into Python fleshed things out more for me.<p><a href=""http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/</a>",1203799842

122191,comment,122106,122106,0,0,timr,,,"Although I agree with nearly everything he says in this essay, it's worth pointing out that he has written several other pieces that would make most normal people question his grip on sanity.  At the very least, this guy is <i>eccentric.</i>  Also, the numbers he cited are from 1999, and are getting a bit dated.  NIH post-doc stipends are now roughly $40k/year (including in the most expensive cities, like San Francisco);  grad-student stipends are around $25k per year.<p>Everything else is true, in my experience.  If you start a PhD in the physical or biological sciences this year, you'll spend 5-10 years in grad school, barely making ends meet at $25k a year.  Then, if you're incredibly lucky (think 95th-percentile lucky), you'll get a stellar paper that will set you up for a post-doc in a superstar lab, which will give you a roughly 50/50 shot at a tenure track position <i>somewhere</i> (don't count on living in a city, or even a place where your significant other can find a job, however, because you're now living at the whims of the academic system.)<p>Your post-doc will take 3-4 years, and will pay you less than you could have made right out of an undergraduate CS program, in exchange for more risk and longer hours.  You'll  be expected to work nights and weekends, and in case you lack the drive to do it, there will be some guy from China with a J-1 visa sitting next to you.  He's probably living in a boarding house right next to the university with ten other post-docs, and he's willing to work 100-hour weeks for a shot at a job in this country.  That's your baseline.<p>If you're astronomically lucky, you'll get a faculty position -- hopefully not at Podunk U -- where you'll be paid significantly less than that undergrad CS major (who is now probably making over $100k/year, buying a home, getting married, etc.)  You'll be competing for grant money in an insanely tight market (the funding rate for NIH research grants is well below 5% now), and evaluated by established faculty who will torpedo your proposals if it helps their own chances.  At the end of six years of insane work, you'll get a shot at keeping your job.  If you get tenure, you can settle down to a lifetime of below-market wages, while working relaxing 50-60 hour weeks.<p>Of course, if you choose to leave academia after grad school, the prospects are equally dismal.  The rare position that requires research experience is essentially set aside for friends (you hear a lot about ""networking"" on the science job boards, but little practical advice on how to actually do it), or for people who have been poached from other companies by recruiters.  Meanwhile, once you have a PhD, you're untouchable by most employers -- considered too theoretical and expensive for ""practical"" work.  Ultimately, most people with advanced degrees in the sciences spend <i>years</i> teaching courses on contract, or jumping between dead-end, low-paying jobs, hoping to start something that resembles a career.",1203799649

Karma allows us to get an idea of how we fit on the scale and see what our strengths or weaknesses are. If you make a post / statement and it doesn't get upmodded, you want to know why; was your reasoning to shallow, is there something that contradicts / disproves your view, etc.<p>That's why there's the effort  to keep fluff posts out; it changes it from being ""hacker karma"" to ""interesting karma"" at best and ""amusing karma"" at worst.",1203798925

122177,comment,122121,122162,0,0,edw519,,,"Understood.  I guess the point I was trying to make was that if you do your key differentiator well, then the web-design, marketing, and billing will be much easier to do.  It's much easier to sell a game breaker than just another thing.<p>OTOH, there's not much need for billing if you don't have something fantastic to sell.<p>My experience is that when you really focus on the one big thing all the small things get even smaller once you get around to them.  Hope that helps.<p>EDIT:  It just occured to me that pg describes this concept (What's the best thing you could be working on, and why aren't you?) much more eloquently here:<p><a href=""http://paulgraham.com/procrastination.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://paulgraham.com/procrastination.html</a>",1203798163

122175,comment,122121,122121,0,0,NickSmith,,,"I've found that when we are confident, relaxed and grounded in the present moment, prioritisation tends to take care of itself, in as much as 'what's next' becomes quite clear and obvious.  So (at least to me) the problem of priorities is really a symptom of the greater issue of how stay relaxed and centred in the natural 'flow' of your project/start-up.  This is not so easy, particularly if this is your first start up because, almost by definition, you are working outside of your old comfort zones.  But I wrote a little piece* about this that might help.<p>Also, it can help if you keep a list of low complexity, low priority tasks that you can pick from as your fancy takes you, when your motivation is low or you are just having an off day.   You'll be suprised how ticking off these low priority tasks will give you a sense of progress that restores your clarity and motivation to tackle those bigger, more complex milestones.

But, for someone who has already read and loved ""A Mathematician's Apology"" and studied math in college, reading about these personalities can be quite fascinating.  Of course, since this is a novel, it's hard to say what is surmise, what is fact, and what is invented.

A lot of great companies have come out of disgruntled grad students.<p>I think the thing we need to figure out is how to deal with the period after a Masters and before a PhD. This is the period where you start doing real research and you learn to work on your own. This period is what makes grad school such valuable training. This is also the period in your life where you are still young and hungry to make an impact. Unfortunately, it's almost easier to stay in school and finish your degree, but once you finish it you're 30 and the hunger and energy are gone.

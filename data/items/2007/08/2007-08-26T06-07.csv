But it always helps to lay them out literally.  I think that many people realize that mobile platform is poised to be great, but no one's really figured out how to go about it, in addition to it not being as open.  <p>The number one thing I think is important is what was pointed out in #1 in the paper--that all mobile interactions are highly personal.  They're viewed as an extension of self, and always on a person.  Therefore, any mobile application that fails to be actually courteous to the owner will fail, and fail miserably.",1188110871

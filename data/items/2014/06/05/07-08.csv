For example, Kurds in Turkey.<p>If we take Israel as an example, the way post-Holocaust Jews empowered themselves to fix their own oppression was to create a new country they controlled, win a war of independence defending it, and then emigrate there <i>en masse</i>. A parallel philosophy has at times also been popular among Black Americans, in that case known as Black Nationalism or Afro-Nationalism (subtly different terms depending on the focus), i.e. that Black Americans should control their own destiny in their own country, which requires, as a prerequisite, declaring independence from white-controlled America. But that movement has not been successful, in part because of the lack of any agreement on where the country would be located (various locations in both North America and Africa have been proposed), and in part because the Integrationist philosophy, holding that Black Americans are Americans, not a separate nation, has eclipsed Afro-Nationalism in popularity. There have been experiments in setting up an African-American state in Africa (Liberia), and also attempts to set up Black-controlled enclaves within the United States (one of the goals of the Black Panther movement), but they have been mostly unsuccessful. Actually the viewpoints of the Black Panthers on cultural cohesion and healthy communities sound not too different from what you&#x27;ve been mentioning in this thread.",1401954856

7850722,comment,7850456,7850456,18,0,vicbrooker,,,"Aussie law student here. IANAL. I haven&#x27;t studied IP in a year or so but I&#x27;m not convinced that the startup has a huge claim to the name HealthKit at all. I&#x27;ve looked at both US and local law in the past so I&#x27;ll try and explain in case it helps any founders reading this.<p>&quot;HealthKit&quot;, in the context of both healthkit.com and the dev kit describes the intend purpose of the IP. The startup seems to produce a software &quot;kit&quot; for health practitioners and the Apple version is obviously a dev kit that deals with the new health app.<p>Any trademark that describes intended purpose is called a &#x27;descriptive mark&#x27; (lawyers are an imaginative bunch) and are generally really hard to protect. You need to show evidence of market use, and for lack of a better word, traction. Apple actually seem to have the stronger argument here: MapKit, GameKit, UIKit etc. have been used for ages and are recognised in the software community as being associated with Apple. This would be categorised as a software trademark and I&#x27;m not sure that the startup can establish a strong argument that they&#x27;ve a) established their brand in the software market and that b) they should be able to exclude Apple to prevent confusion. This is consistent with both Aus and US law to my knowledge, and successfully establishing themselves in the Australian market, or filing a trademark here won&#x27;t bind the US anyway.<p>Bottom line, the more generic and descriptive your name (in context), the harder it will be to successfully defend it. Owning a .com doesn&#x27;t count for much, if anything (even trying to register a generic descriptive word + .com - mattress.com was registered unsuccessfully IIRC). You need to get eyeballs on it and sell stuff to win this with a common law/equitable trademark. Considering I hadn&#x27;t heard of HealthKit.com until this happened they might struggle with this.<p>If you&#x27;re a founder and you want to protect your name, pick a name that is something arbitrary or suggestive. Healthkit.com&#x27;s claims would be much stronger if it was named Potato or Voozle and Apple used the same name for a dev kit. It makes it far harder to communicate your product quickly but thats the tradeoff. Names that invoke your product through onomatopoeia, like &#x27;Twitter&#x27; strike a good balance between effective communication and defensibility. They&#x27;re bloody hard to come up with though.<p>Hopefully, HealthKit.com use this as an opportunity to get their message out to their target audience, they&#x27;re getting an audience on hacker news but its doctors they should be going for.<p>As an aside, it&#x27;s interesting to see how much of the media is confusing the HealthKit dev kit with the Health app. Helps with the story I guess.",1401954390

What I disagree with is this statement/attitude:<p>> <i>I&#x27;ve flagged down a cop seeing a kid alone in a car, and would do it again.</i><p>The interesting and proper question isn&#x27;t whether it&#x27;s unsafe to leave a four year old alone in a parked car, it&#x27;s whether leaving a four year old alone in a parked car warrants involvement from the State -- particularly, involvement kicked off by a fellow citizen.<p>It surprises and deeply concerns me that we live in a country/world of social content and community-driven projects, yet when one of our (real-life) community members might possibly be in trouble, a cellphone video and call to the cops is the default (and lauded) reaction. Look, had that 4-year-old been in real danger, a cellphone video wasn&#x27;t going to help him. A call to the cops wasn&#x27;t going to help him either (clearly, as they arrived after mom had left). Ok, maybe a coin flip on the cops at best.<p>What can the cops do that the nosy neighbor -- or you -- couldn&#x27;t? Truly, if someone felt a child&#x27;s life was in danger, everything else could wait while you supervised the situation and sent someone else to go fetch mom out of the store. Or use that cellphone to call the store, or whatever. In other words, you could <i>actually do something</i>.

And the Pic Stitch makes $824 per day (annualised to $300K). So the question is: is the app business about in-app monetisation, which works rather well for the gaming companies. Just use free AppInTop Spy service to look the revenue of gaming companies in the US (register free, press SPY icon on the top left hand side of the dashboard). Some make over $100,000 per day. But then the cost for the prime spots and the battle against King.com and Supercell costs much much more.",1401953155

7850645,comment,7847440,7850303,4,0,jacquesm,,,"> Most people that will be taking credit cards directly via a form like this will have merchant account and be authorized to use the credit card logos.<p>Using logos in combination with a credit card capture form comes with a different set of rules (and a different contract!) than just being allowed to use some third party processor that does all the work for you.<p>If you want to capture the cards yourself instead of outsourcing the job to an IPSP then you&#x27;re going to have to be at a minimum PCI compliant. This goes for any company that <i>stores</i>, <i>processes</i> or <i>transmits</i> credit card information. The tipping point is somewhere around a million $ US per year. Below that the cost of being in compliance outweighs the fees the IPSP charges for their service handily.<p>The word &#x27;credit&#x27; in credit cards stands for &#x27;trust&#x27;.<p><a href=""https://www.google.com/search?client=ubuntu&channel=fs&q=origin+of+the+word+credit&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/search?client=ubuntu&channel=fs&q=ori...</a><p>People trust those companies and by extension trust those logos. That&#x27;s why when you use them you will be held to the rules so strictly because credit card companies do not like it when their logos are used to give an aura of trust to an otherwise non-trustworthy situation. Just the PDF about what you can and can not do <i>visually</i> with the logo runs to lots of pages.<p>Yes, there are plenty of ways in which using those logos is absolutely ok, and where using this form is (probably) just fine.<p>Everybody that is PCI DSS compliant can likely use it without any problem. Yes, there are also plenty of ways in which using this form is strictly against the terms of service, typically this includes everybody who is not PCI certified, which is almost every two bit merchant on the web that outsources their payment processing and credit card capture to some third party.<p>So, if you use a 3rd party solution that serves up the payment form and that handles the card capture and subsequent processing for you and you have a contract with them rather than with the card company you can use the logos and nobody will care, mostly because you can&#x27;t do much harm (such as your paypal example).<p>But if you are in a situation where you have a merchant account but you are <i>not</i> the merchant of record (this means you are a sub-merchant, such as when using any one of a number of IPSPs) then using this form is most likely not a good idea.<p>As for me backing up my claims, I&#x27;m not going to attach a copy of my merchant agreement to a comment on the web, you are totally free to disregard what I wrote. This advice is worth exactly what you paid for, and <i>everybody that has a merchant account but is not the merchant of record</i> (aka a &#x27;sub-merchant&#x27; in payment processing lingo) is totally free to inspect their own personal copy and for everybody else this does not matter at all.<p>Further reading on the subject:<p><a href=""https://www.pcicomplianceguide.org/pci-faqs-2/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.pcicomplianceguide.org/pci-faqs-2/</a><p>A list with a sample of payment facilitators (if you use one of these you are quite possibly <i>not</i> the merchant of record):<p><a href=""http://www.mastercard.us/merchants/accept-mastercard/payment-facilitator.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mastercard.us/merchants/accept-mastercard/payment...</a><p>Note that this is not an exhaustive list by a long shot.<p>The mastercard FAQ which has a nice little blurb about who is and who is not a merchant or record:<p><a href=""http://www.mastercard.us/merchants/assistance/faq.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mastercard.us/merchants/assistance/faq.html</a><p>Also of interest:<p><a href=""http://www.mastercardbrandcenter.com/us/images/acceptance_marks_v06.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mastercardbrandcenter.com/us/images/acceptance_ma...</a><p>Less interesting (branding, not acceptance marks):<p><a href=""https://www.mastercardbrandcenter.com/us/getourbrand/index.shtml?pageId=dl_1510&expertVisible=false"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.mastercardbrandcenter.com/us/getourbrand/index.s...</a><p>Oh, and an afterthought: there is yet another important logo, the VBV one, you can only use this if you&#x27;re actually part of the program.",1401952904

When you say &#x27;So the compiler is indeed able to keep performance for these small structs on par with primitives&#x27;, is this based on your experiments or on some theoretical analysis? If the former that&#x27;s indeed impressive - I would guess that behind the curtains it uses some kind of macro based approach rather than actually implementing it as a struct where you&#x27;re always going to have some additional integer ops to calculate addresses? If the latter I don&#x27;t quite get how you arrive at that conclusion, could you expand?",1401951656

They didn&#x27;t replace it with something better; they just took it away. Maybe a Unicode issue?<p>Not only is PCRE not universal, overall support might even be waning.",1401951637

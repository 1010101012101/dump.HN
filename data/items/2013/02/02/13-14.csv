But we also live in a society and, as hackers, in a sub-culture where we generally prize reason and debate over emotion.  When we're debating other topics here, this reason-over-emotion thing doesn't seem to be a problem.<p>If someone says ""I want you to do, believe or refrain from doing or believing something, and I can't explain why"" then we generally ignore it.  In no other context would this be seen as a reasonable line of argument.<p>The thing is, I don't often see people saying ""this makes me feel bad ergo it's a bad thing"".  Most feminists have well-worked-out arguments for their positions and it's not hard for any reasonable person to accept them.  I've been persuaded of many feminist arguments and this has contributed to changing how I see the world.  Sure, when we're talking about arguments on Twitter then there's not a lot of space to cite references or bring in supporting arguments, but to pretend that they don't exist or aren't necessary isn't helping.<p>tl;dr I think the hacker community prizes rationalism and if you want to persuade them of anything you should use rational and not emotional arguments.

Isn't the big advantage that when you use currying that all functions have an arity of '1'?<p>That means no more messing with varargs, named args (on the calling side), positional args, defaults and so on, every function takes one argument and one argument only, currying is then used to bypass the limitations of having only one argument to work with.",1359810296

I've actually seen variants of it done in a few private JIT's for dynamic languages, but not to this extent (mainly because most languages don't have code that change types as often as javascript :P). In the worst case, they still have to monitor every property write, they just use some forms of static analysis to try to reduce this in what they hope is the common case (that the types are not changing over the program lifetime).<p>The rest is just research.\nInteresting research nonetheless, but research.\nI don't say that as a dig, more to point out that while some of it may be productionized, most of it probably won't.<p>At least to me, i'm most impressed that the author doesn't present their research as the be-all, end-all of JIT's, but instead, something that may turn out well.\nThis is not something against JIT research, i've just read <i>way</i> too many compiler analysis and optimization papers that don't actually compare against anywhere the near the state of the art, and then act as if they've made huge gains instead of incremental improvements.",1359810290

Typically, calls involve things like: ""I'm looking at the plane on the ground, x looks like it has broken off, what do I do?"" instead of asking for instructions to land the plane, but I can assure you that they can give that kind of advice on short notice too.",1359810028

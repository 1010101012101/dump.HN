I'm currently out in India but when I left 6 months ago there was (I think) a sense of just shrugging the shoulders and getting on with life. At this point, more scandals, bailouts & controversies would just be adding to the pile. People will complain but there won't be any kind of mass movement in protest.

The public aren't angry with companies or multinationals. They're angry with private banks, a government which made private debt public on the insistence of the EU and with the EU which is forcing extreme hardship to repay other EU banks.

After Napster went down, Shawn Fanning co-founded Rupture and Path, and Sean Parker went on to become the first president of Facebook, key investor in Spotify, and managing partner at the Founders Fund.<p>Kazaa is another great example. After their legal walloping, the founders and development team behind Kazaa regrouped to form Skype.<p>And then there's The Pirate Bay, which is still rolling merrily along, court rulings notwithstanding. Its team hasn't created any billion-dollar companies yet (we'll see what happens with Flattr), but they created a political party that's won elections in multiple countries, as well as the webhosting company PRQ, which was Wikileaks' home in its early days.<p>I don't think all of these later successes are a coincidence. Filesharing involves hard technical problems, hard logistical problems, and intense competition. If you were an investor, a blind strategy of giving money to the best pirates you can find seems like it might be surprisingly sound.",1354524408

When you see it at the top-level, like in parliament, its almost always done for effect.",1354524295
4864541,comment,4864190,4864478,3,0,eoin_murphy,,,"Gaelic is compulsory for both primary and secondary school which means that almost everyone will study it between the ages of 5 and 16 (minimum school leaving age). It says something about our approach that all but a very small minority of school leavers are effectively unable to hold a conversation in the language.<p>It's been compulsory since the formation of the Irish state during that time the percentage of actual spoken Irish (as well as general Irish comprehension) has continually dropped. Given that the actual aim of this was to promote the language I think it's safe to say it's been an unmitigated disaster.<p>My personal take on this (I went to an all Irish primary school so I was fluent) is that there's two factors here:<p>1 - The way it's taught is absolutely terrible. There's a focus on the grammar and structure of the language rather than actually speaking it. This means that students associate it with memorizing genitive and dative cases which is pretty boring. This means the student don't like it. Some of those students grow up to be the teachers, and they've got a negative attitude to the language. Wash, rinse repeat for 90 years and you get to where we are now.<p>2 - There's no economic incentive to learn the language. Unless you're living in a gaeltacht (nearly all in very rural areas) you're almost never actually going to be able to use it. It's not present in any other country and apart from having conversations which foreigners can't understand, isn't useful. There are reasons to learn it but they're cultural or academic rather than practical.<p>There are signs of regrowth with more and more all Irish schools popping up but my impression is that it's become a middle class status symbol to be able to speak the language so we'll see what happens there. There's also been discussion about reforming the syllabus to split it into conversational Irish (compulsory) and 'academic' Irish (optional)<p>As for dealing with the government, you're permitted (not obligated) to conduct all of your business with officials through Irish and demand that they do the same with you. We have two versions of our constitution, one in Irish and one in English. In the case of any discrepancies, the Irish one takes precedence.",1354524294

They also told me that, if you start and fail, you will be personally bankrupt.<p>This is something I've been told many, many times throughout my professional career in Japan. And it's obviously not true -- harder than in the US, for sure -- but definitely not impossible. I see new companies springing up all the time in Japan, and not just what we would think of as startups, but also Entrepreneurial ventures in industries such as manufacturing, finance and trade.<p>Equally refreshing is this view of the old and new Japan coming from a Japanese person. I hear stuff about the new Japanese culture all the time from ExPats in the startup community, but normally this new vs old is the elephant in the room when the Japanese talk about the future of Japanese business (at least in my experience).<p>I still remember when SMAP went to GREE's headquarters and did an interview with Tanaka a few years ago -- ""How can you be head of a huge company, you're younger than me!""<p>PS - Other favorite quote from a show about up and coming CEOs in Japan: ""How can people be making that much money on the INTERNET?!?!""",1354522584

I know you're probably not a tax lawyer, but what's the personal capital gains situation like over there?<p>Also, just wondering what ""morale"" (for lack of a better word) is like now, given all the bailouts, budget crises, and even church scandals. All you hear about Ireland in the US media these days seems to be doom and gloom.<p>Is there a chance, given the public's hostile reaction to the bank bailouts and economic crisis, that Ireland could tack left and start rolling back its advantageous tax rates?<p>Thanks in advance.",1354522252

4864440,comment,4857290,4863123,1,0,pjmlp,,,"> The problem with the ""sufficiently smart compiler"" argument, as always, is that the compiler may have a lot of optimizations, but it's still not an artificial intelligence. It can't tell that what you are trying to do with your set of operations is actually perform CRC, and there is hardware support for that.<p>This might be a special case, as you're taking advantage of a specific use case instruction, which will fail in portable code anyway.<p>I have seen Assembly programmers put to shame in modern processors by C and C++ developers, just by making use of better data structures, algorithms and a special mix of compiler flags.<p>Anyway thanks for the follow up, very interesting.",1354522062

In short, the ""resonant peak"" dis-associates into two (or more) peaks, which ruins efficiency.  Not to mention the effects of material composition (metal => bad).<p>To date, the only proposed approach to this problem is time division multiplexing (TDM) on each device and/or adaptive frequency tuning at the transmitter (which has regulatory issues).  AFAIK, this is the same problem plaguing the other resonant wireless power transfer companies (eg. Witricity).<p>[I played around with a bit of this stuff during grad school.

4864422,comment,4862813,4863178,3,0,BoredAstronaut,,,"How do you measure the is-ness of the state? By it's budgetary expenditures? Many existent states (like Canada) have relatively small military budgets. For them, wielding or even threatening to wield violence is not their primary reason for being. Their primary reason for being is to ensure the health and welfare of their citizens, and they do so not by threat of violence, but by collection and distribution of taxes and passing of laws.<p>The vast majority of people in most democratic societies do not require the threat of arrest and imprisonment to follow the majority of laws. Assuredly there are minor disagreements about which the validity of certain laws, and many people cheat a little here and there. But when the majority of citizens believe that the majority of the law, and the state which imposes it, is unjust, you have an authoritarian government, and a revolution is inevitable.<p>It might also be worth noting that even if, based on budgetary spending, the US government is primarily an institution of the force and its display, most of that is happening outside of US soil. Most of it, in fact, is deployed in protecting sea lanes for the benefit of shipping and the people who rely on it: namely, everyone on Earth. I'm not American, and I don't like everything about America, but I'm damn grateful for the fact that the American government is funding the security of the machinery which keeps food and goods flowing around the world, since a lot of people where I live (Canada) would have difficulty surviving the Winter (and maybe even in Summer) without it.<p>To what extent global commerce and trade are just or unjust is another question, but I suggest it can be addressed on a case-by-case basis, and that the vast majority is far more beneficial than detrimental to everyone involved.",1354521619

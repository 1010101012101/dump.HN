What I found interesting about this link, which I heard about from a medical genetics researcher, is that the British Gut Study is connected to the Twins Early Development Study (TEDS), which has been going on for twenty years, so it will include some data that are from a genetically sensitive study design. That makes it easier (but not completely easy) to tease out environmental influences on gut microbes from individual genetic influences on gut microbes. The study also includes some data on the twins&#x27; health and some other variables of interest. The TEDS research program and all of its study subjects are based in Britain, but the study design is of such interest around the world that the United States federal government helps fund it.",1431349087

9524283,comment,9523555,9523555,0,0,leni536,,,"I tried to use PGP (gnupg) but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be simple even for an advanced user. Since I use Debian already it means that I implicitly trust Debian maintainers. So I explicitly trusted one Debian maintainer in gnupg. From there I thought that verifying other keys would be a breeze since I have a trusted guy in the strong set. While there are online tools (at least one) to find trust paths between IDs I didn&#x27;t find a tool that does this automatically and verify signatures through this. This should be seamless without manually tracking down trust paths, manually importing keys that I don&#x27;t want just to verify an ID 2-4 hops away.<p>Here is my concern with the WOT: it&#x27;s not clear what signatures mean. It could mean &quot;This guy can give out valid signatures&quot; or &quot;I verified that this guy&#x27;s name is John Doe&quot; or &quot;This is the key used to sign Debian isos&quot;, but these are all implicit. Typically it&#x27;s the first two which makes it hard to use PGP with pseudonyms. When you verify a signature in PGP you want the following chain:<p>o--I trust this guy&#x27;s signatures-->o--I trust this guy&#x27;s signatures-->o--I know this guy-->o<p>Other concerns: any way to rotate the master key would be nice. I wouldn&#x27;t assume that my master key won&#x27;t be compromised in the next 50 years .Then I would have to rebuild my whole WOT and revoke my previous master key (If I can). Key distributon should be decentralized.<p>Maybe I&#x27;m missing something, but this is my takeaway and I really tried to like PGP and gnupg. Maybe Google will solve some of these concerns on their interface but I wouldn&#x27;t bet on it. I&#x27;m not surprised that PGP isn&#x27;t widely used. I would really like a safe end-to-end encryption implementation that is easy to use.",1431348835

9524256,comment,9523431,9524096,0,0,pron,,,"> I see it as an ideology.<p>Some parts of it -- sure -- but an ideology firmly based on evidence. Just like deciding that spending public funds on the design of the first computers or the internet -- or any technology -- is an ideology based on evidence. I&#x27;m not asking you to accept the ideology, though. You don&#x27;t want to build computers -- fine! But sexism is as real as electrons.<p>I am sure some CS professors have strong opinions on whether we should build self-driving cars. Their ideology doesn&#x27;t make their research any less valid. In fact, I&#x27;d expect CS professors to be very much &quot;pro-tech&quot; because they know better than the average person what&#x27;s possible. Similarly, it&#x27;s only to be expected that researchers studying sexism or racism will be very much opposed to them, because they know better than the average person how harmful they are. Their ideology doesn&#x27;t disqualify their research, either.<p>> It&#x27;s either &quot;our way, or the old way&quot;<p>What way? I just look at the research. You have a different explanation for how species evolve or why women make less money than men, put it out there so it can be studied. We can&#x27;t &quot;teach the controversy&quot; because there is no controversy to teach. There&#x27;s the vast majority of researchers on one hand, and a small yet vocal group of deniers on the other.<p>> the current mainstream thoughts on sexism<p>I don&#x27;t know what you mean by that; I do know what the studies tell us about how sexism spreads, what it looks like, and what its consequences are. You may have a very different understanding of what sexism is from how the academic studies define it, but to me what you said sounds just like &quot;the current mainstream thoughts on evolution&quot;. You just arbitrarily chose to disqualify a vast body of research because it doesn&#x27;t jive with your gut feelings on the subject.<p>> On my beliefs, suffice it to say: I don&#x27;t like sexism<p>I don&#x27;t think you understand. Whether or not you like sexism is irrelevant. What matters first of all -- before we get to ideology -- is to study how certain power structures perpetuate themselves in society. Once you know that -- and only then -- you can decide what to do about it if anything. I don&#x27;t like that people can&#x27;t fly. But I know that the reason we can&#x27;t is that we don&#x27;t have wings, and the reason for that is evolutionary, and the mechanism is genetic. So, to make people fly we can either change their genes -- which may be hard or easy, safe or dangerous, ethically problematic or not -- or decide on some other way of dealing with it (building airplanes, for example). Luckily, thanks to decades of research, we already know quite a bit about sexism -- just as we know quite a bit about the limits to human flight -- so there&#x27;s no need to start from first principles and/or total ignorance every time we discuss it. When we discuss human flights we can talk about genes and aerodynamics -- we don&#x27;t need to treat the subject so mysteriously and suspiciously. Same goes for sexism.",1431348562

Yes.<p>The worst I have seen was a team of several hundred people who, on $200 half-broken laptops, were running - in parallel - 500MB Excel files for hours every day, which basically did a few linear operations on about 30 variables, before joining the results in a superfile itself taking up to 20 minutes just to open on a gaming-specced desktop.<p>In another case, I broke down an Excel model with over 50 tabs and discovered that there were only 2 input variables. Unfortunately the CFO of that business decided to go for the ostrich strategy (after all the monster model impressed investors).<p>Every business I have ever worked in had some convoluted, cumbersome, buggy, opaque, human-dependent Excel processes. My co-founder and I finance our startup replacing these with tight scripts running on AWS (amongst other things) - it&#x27;s low hanging fruit. We approach these things as a black box, figure out desired behaviour, and rebuild from scratch.<p>Excel wins all the time because it&#x27;s a UI that managers are familiar with, and they are often either the consumers, or want to audit your data processes. It&#x27;s got a LOT of tooling that lets non-technical users do things they shouldn&#x27;t.<p>If you thought Python Pandas was an improvement, try learning about the relational model and how to use a decent relational database (I recommend PostgreSQL, whose error messages will teach you a few things and which has a saner type system where you CAN compare two different integer types without getting NULL). You&#x27;d be amazed how far you can go with just SQL.<p>You should also do so from a UNIX OS, and from the command line (using pg, editing a file then running \f blah.sql). It will take you a few hours of pain but will be worth it in added productivity and transparency over any point and click alternatives.<p>What you&#x27;re touching on is the power of abstraction, functional vs imperative programming, and particularly how proving programs can be enormously productive. SQL is powerful for this because it is declarative and very close to mathematics (Codd brought set theory to databases).<p>The next steps are category and type theory and then the Haskell/Mercury/Idris/Coq rabbit hole... an unpopular one because, as someone once told me, &quot;businesses are resilient to application errors&quot;...",1431346960

The point of the SLS project is to re-purpose the Space Shuttle&#x27;s technology to develop a launch vehicle. It uses the Space Shuttle&#x27;s liquid hydrogen/oxygen main engines (SMEs) as well as the solid-fuel rocket boosters (SRBs). SpaceX has no experience working with this technology: its rockets use an RP-1 (kerosene) based design. Also, the target lift capability of the SLS is 2-3x as much as the Falcon Heavy.[1]<p>SpaceX is doing great things, but they have a defined mission and so far have focused their limited resources on a family of related designs with an eye towards that mission. The vast majority of the aerospace engineering talent in the U.S. does not work at SpaceX. They work at Boeing, Lockheed-Martin, etc. It will be a long time before it&#x27;s reasonable to make a comment implying that NASA chose Boeing instead of SpaceX because of lobbyists.<p>[1] See: <a href=""http://www.spacesafetymagazine.com/falcon-heavy-uncertain-case-lunar-exploration"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.spacesafetymagazine.com/falcon-heavy-uncertain-ca...</a>.",1404737724

Similarly, the internet is full of blog posts with 1000-word articles explain how &quot;easy&quot; it is to do something in PowerShell that should&#x27;ve been a one liner to begin with. Basically, the builtins just suck. Batteries included? No way.<p>Someone at the MS marketing department decided that, in order to make PowerShell popular, it has to be cool.

Many huge projects started without kickstarter, even if they receive lots of contributions and donations nowadays, they never used to need it.<p>Hmm, and I remember some post on HN a few months ago about why open source projects should not ask for money/donations in the first place. The crux of it was that they basically become a company then: they work for money. People will expect something for that money, and A) features might be made simply because the developer feels he needs to do <i>something</i> in return for they money he&#x27;s getting and B) people who donate a lot (i.e. have a lot of money) get a huge say in the project even if their ideas turn out to be horrible in practice.",1404737161

On top of that, it&#x27;s amazing to be in a position where you can make it happen.<p>I&#x27;ve got a lot of similarities with your story.<p>I dropped out of EE in 1997 when I was 18. A few years later, in 2003, I was about to begin studying writing and literature when I realized that my hobby-become-job, programming, was what I was truly passionate about.<p>At first, I tinkered with useless online courses (they were much more useless ten years ago). I finally put life plans in motion so that I could study CS at a university. I began studying CS in 2006 with the goal of becoming a security expert. I got my undergrad degree in CS when I was 30.<p>While an undergrad, I got involved with research and decided to go to grad school. To give me more experience, meet more people in my field, and generally improve grad school options, I took an extra year doing research in a CS department before applying to grad programs. In that time I published a research paper with people I&#x27;d admired from before I went back to school. I got my choice of top research programs and went to grad school in 2010.<p>In 2012, I realized academia wasn&#x27;t for me and had a startup idea I wanted to pursue. Now, two years and a huge amount of learning and new experiences later, I&#x27;ve got a quickly growing startup with amazing people on our team. I no longer write much code, but I love my new challenges every day.<p>You don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;ll end up doing, but if you know you want to study CS, then start as soon as you can. Life&#x27;s too short to delay doing what you know you should do.",1404737127

We&#x27;re not really a &quot;startup&quot; anymore, but we&#x27;re still very small. I wasn&#x27;t here when the first version of the product was built so I wasn&#x27;t part of that decision.<p>If I were building this product from scratch today as a money-poor startup, I would probably go with tech stack included Java or Python and PostgreSQL. The primary motivation being cost (as in money).<p>Each developer is technically required to have an MSDN/VS Pro license (renews for just under $1000 per year). This is not very expensive if you&#x27;re generating revenue, but if bootstrapping it is not cheap. You could cheat and just share a single license; you definitely won&#x27;t get caught.<p>Windows Server licenses, compared to other datacenter costs, are relatively inexpensive. Windows Server has a few advantages; particularly in it&#x27;s easy to administer and there are plenty of sysadmins out there than know it well.<p>The elephant in the room, at least for a SaaS product, is SQL Server. The features of Enterprise Edition are so compelling for SaaS (HADR, unlimited RAM, online index operations, compression, and encryption) that it&#x27;s practically a requirement. But this will quickly become one of the most expensive costs in your datacenter.<p>But in my experience, SQL Server has some real advantages that I haven&#x27;t yet discovered for PostgreSQL. The &quot;community&quot; around SQL Server is huge and has a ton of great people who love to help (often for free!). For instance check out <a href=""http://brentozar.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://brentozar.com</a> or <a href=""http://sqlblog.com/blogs/adam_machanic/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sqlblog.com/blogs/adam_machanic/</a>.<p>There are programs like Bizspark which can bring the initial software license investment down to nearly $0. But if you&#x27;re not generating significant revenue after three years, the licensing costs could hurt.<p>So like everything in world, it depends. But the bottom line is that, in my opinion, if you&#x27;re bootstrapping then costs matter and Microsoft products (SQL Server in particular) are a huge cost which have real viable alternatives.",1404737066

Once you built your application on ASP.NET, you are pretty much limited to Windows servers or Mono on Linux and even that step may need some work because Mono is an incomplete subset of the Windows environment.<p>I would say the same for developing software that only runs on Solaris (and its descendants). Despite Solaris being an amazingly solid OS, if your app does not run neatly on other OSs, you are limiting yourself - you made many architectural decisions very early in the development process that will impact it for a very long time and, if you are not careful, limit your future decisions to whatever is available from a single vendor.<p>The last time I made a decision to move from Windows to Unix-likes it was a Java application running on the Orion server. It was a 15-minute job, even though we never gave much thought to porting it. I seriously doubt such thing is possible with ASP.NET and Mono.<p>Apart from .NET, there is little reason to go with Windows. Most of my development these days is with JavaScript, Python (with Flask or Django) and PHP. None of these would run any better on Windows.",1404736970

It doesn&#x27;t hurt Germany. Also the spying on her phone last year. She didn&#x27;t really care all that much. After all, USA is the biggest partner of the EU/Germany. Germany can&#x27;t afford a dent in the relationship with the US. It&#x27;s the US who&#x27;s providing security to most of the western world. Who&#x27;s supposed to protect us from Putin? The NATO?<p>The biggest fear for Merkel is twofold:<p>- Industry espionage. This would attack Germany at what they&#x27;re best at and be huge problem. USA has been lucky to not be caught about that (in Germany).<p>- The much bigger problem for Merkel is however the growing Anti-Americanism in Germany. There has always been a good amount of it. But mostly, Germans see the US as a partner. There is in huge decline and it&#x27;s a growing problem. Germans are much more serious about their privacy than Americans and the spying scandal didn&#x27;t help America. Merkel also knows that she has to listen much more to the German public than for instance Obama has to listen to Americans. Germany has a very well functioning Democracy and any pressure from the public will quickly result in resignations or losing the next election. Germany has done this before: Kohl&#x27;s affair got his party out. The FDP got thrown out of the parliament last year. You can quickly go from 40% to under 20% in Germany.\nDue to the many US scandals in the last 2 years, Germans see America very very skeptic these days. Der Spiegel yesterday&#x27;s issue has some numbers: Who should Germany work together with? USA: 56%. Russia: 53%.<p>If you read many of the forums in Germany you&#x27;ll see the growing dissatisfaction with the US as a partner. And more and more understanding for Putin these days.<p>My point of this post is: What this means it that if USA continues to bully the German people, then Merkel will be forced to take action and do something that she doesn&#x27;t actually want to. She knows very well that America is extremely important and without a good relationship things will get much tougher in Europe/Germany. After all Germany is benefiting from the huge security the US provides to us. But Germans don&#x27;t think that far ahead and only see the bully in America these days. I hope it doesn&#x27;t get this far that Merkel is forced (by the German people/media) into getting distance from America since it would hurt both, Germany and the US.\nI&#x27;m very certain that Obama know that Merkel will always be his friend. But I&#x27;m not so sure if he realizes that the German people can make Merkel do something that she otherwise wouldn&#x27;t do.<p>America: Watch out how far you take the bullying. It might just happen that the next generation of Westerners will end up hating you in 10-20 years down the road. And then, you will have no friends left but only enemies. What Obama and America&#x27;s government does can be very dangerous for America in the future.",1404736762

The odds of getting 7 zeros in the hash of your research paper by chance are indeed less than 1%.<p>However, this is obviously a useless test, its probability of rejecting the null hypothesis <i>given that it is false</i> is likely 1/128... We don&#x27;t really expect the phenomenom that we&#x27;re measuring to produce good hash preimages. In technical terms, the test has no power.<p>However, to even talk about the &quot;power&quot; of a test, one needs a model of what the effect looks like. For instance, we expect the medicine will increase the rate of cures, we expect education will increase job success, etc.<p>And yet, the entire freaking point of p-value testing is to maintain a pretense that Popperianism makes sense. Validating a hypothesis? While my simple minded fellow, that would be anathema! Don&#x27;t you know that Popper explained that you can only refute hypotheses!

I really can&#x27;t hear this anymore and I think it&#x27;s as far from the truth as can be. So, first of all: NO, IT&#x27;s NEVER TOO LATE for you to learn something new, even at the biblical age of 31 :D<p>For a more detailed answer let&#x27;s first have a look at the facts: You&#x27;re 31. You have a University degree in Philosophy. You have several years (?) of work experience in a startup. You&#x27;re passionate about programming. You&#x27;re based in Germany.<p>Should you go study CS to land a job as a programmer? It depends.<p>In Germany, I think it&#x27;s always beneficial if you can show some formal certificate or University degree in CS or a related field if you apply to a position as programmer: The lack of IT talent is not as big here as in the US, so most companies have a larger pool of candidates to select from and will actually care about degrees and relevant prior experience as a programmer, especially if they&#x27;re big corporations. So if you want to go work at BigCorp, a CS degree will open many doors for you.<p>Startups might be more pragmatic when it comes to hiring programmers without formal education in CS, although salaries tend to be much lower there (especially in places like Berlin where there&#x27;s a large influx of programmers from abroad).<p>I think a good strategy for you could be to keep working in a field were you can use your prior experience to make enough money, but where you can progressively add more and more programming and technical tasks to your job (e.g. working as a technical project manager could be interesting).<p>Concerning CS degrees I would have a look at part-time programmes offered by Fachhochschulen (FHs), since most of them have an excellent reputation in the industry, offer very pragmatic and relevant curricula (as opposed to some academic CS programmes) will even allow you to work on your degree part-time, or at least give you the opportunity to already work in a company during your studies.",1404735475

7998346,comment,7997268,7997268,11,0,cheald,,,"Skimming continues to highlight the inherent vulnerability of account information transfer mechanisms (such as magstripe), as opposed to fixed currency transfer mechanisms. The fact that every vendor I transact with has the ability to capture my account information and make future requests for my money with it is terrifying. I have to trust that every 17-year old that handles my card at a restaurant isn&#x27;t going to copy it and shop online with it later. The fact that the system works at all in its current state is a miracle.<p>Even if Bitcoin never gains mass adoption, I <i>really</i> like the idea of being able to encode a consumable transaction that both authorizes the transfer <i>and</i> encodes the transfer amount. I can imagine a similar payment system (NFC payment with phones, perhaps?) that doesn&#x27;t disclose arbitrary access to my account, but instead allows a transaction to be proposed, I accept the transaction on my trusted hardware (phone), and the transaction authorization with amount is then sent up the wire.<p>This seems like it should be trivially accomplishable via mutual asymmetric signing. Vendor generates a request for money and signs it, sends it to my phone. My phone validates the chain-of-trust, presents me with the transaction request, and I can authorize it. If I authorize it, then the request is counter-signed with my private key, and the signed authorization is sent off to the payment processor, who has pubkeys for the vendor and myself and can validate the request and process it.<p>Even if you could capture the transaction-in-transit, you wouldn&#x27;t be able to compromise it, since you would need signing keys for both the vendor and the customer in order to forge the transaction, or to create new transactions with the signed account information.<p>Is there any reason this wouldn&#x27;t work?",1404734859

Is there some comment notification option on hn that I missed?<p>The forbes article you quoted is a bit problematic because the data given are voluntary answers. In studies like these there always is the problem of a potentially skewed return rate: Given a return rate of 30%, what is the wealth inheritance quota of the other 70%? My speculation would be that someone who is proud of the fruit of his own hard work (the quoted local business owner) is more likely to answer such a survey. On the other hand some rich person who found a clever way to unofficially inherit parts of the own wealth while avoiding the correlating taxes  won&#x27;t answer such a survey.<p>At least the second of the blogs.wsj.com studies is self-selected, too. I couldn&#x27;t find the papers for the two other quotes because the sources were too vague.<p>It&#x27;s better to use data sources like tax income of states. IMHO even better is the concept of social mobility (the wikipedia article is quite good: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_mobility"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_mobility</a>), as it also encompasses factors like the parents&#x27; social contacts and educational chances. The studies cited there all use official, non-self-selected data and sometimes even proper longitudinal studies. In the results presented there the USA has the the lowest intergenerational vertical social mobility of all researched OECD countries (i.v.s.m.  means the probability of a child to get into a higher (or lower) class than its parents live in).<p>An example for Germany: The probability of a child of workers to get a degree from a university is 17 times lower than that of a child with academic parents (source: <a href=""http://www.deutschlandfunk.de/geschlossene-gesellschaft-uber-die-verteilung-von.media.09812bea2e59b93a7e5a15894f44b32d.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.deutschlandfunk.de/geschlossene-gesellschaft-uber...</a>).<p>Yes, social mobility is not the same as inherited wealth, because it&#x27;s a result of a combination of inheritance and other factors. On the plus side, the empirical data it&#x27;s based on is of comparibly high quality. The problem is that monetary (as opposed to social etc.) wealth is pretty hard to measure even given government data. In Germany for example the data for people having income is more or less 100% available. But the richer you are, the less probable it is for you to have income: The money then comes from capital gains, rent etc. These are way harder to measure, e.g. the capital gains could get collected by a  corporation and not an individual. The corporations money only gets tapped on demand (=saved inside the corporation hull until retirement). And the child of the owner has a counsulting contract with that company. Legally, thats not inheritance at all,  but practically it pretty much is.",1404734768

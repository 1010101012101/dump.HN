Apple announcing iCloud is kinda like Palm announcing WebOS a couple of years ago, streaming music from LastFM (though iCloud doesn't stream), getting your pics up and down from Flickr, and working on GDocs/Gmail/GCal/Office365.<p>Windows is an OS.  iOS is an OS.  Mac OSX is an OS.  The iCloud service is designed to allow you to shuffle from one to the other seamlessly but not to replace those machines altogether.  Kinda like using dropbox.<p>Now, is the OS becoming less important in comparison to the services available?  Absolutely.  Not for everyone but for the average user it certainly is.  Will iCloud suceed? Surely it will, but only for those who wish to be tied into Apple products (unless I am mistaken and you will be able to share iCloud uploads with Android or WP devices).",1307483851
2631062,comment,2629633,2629633,6,0,andywood,,,"I relate to this very strongly, and it's the #1 thing stopping me from publicizing my work more. I see a lot of comments saying things like ""I don't see the problem; I use X for work and Y for personal life.""  That isn't the problem.<p>The problem is having lots of different, separate audiences, each across several different sites. I'm a composer wanting to grow an audience for my music, a professional software developer wanting to develop my day-job career, a 3D engine developer wanting to write up my realtime rendering research and correspond with other graphics programmers, an indie game developer wanting to cultivate a following for my game, a paraglider wanting to communicate constantly with other paragliders about weather and flying opportunities, and finally a regular guy wanting to keep up with friends and family about more ordinary things.<p>Each of those subjects has a separate audience that hardly overlaps with the others. The worst part is that most of those things could use a Twitter account for daily updates and engagement, a blog for more detailed write-ups, and a YouTube channel for video or music. The music probably wants a SoundCloud account. Some of those things want separate email accounts. Some want dedicated web sites.<p>Having a properly rounded web presence seems like a nightmare of account management. I imagine keeping a spreadsheet with a huge matrix of login info. It's possible to do it - it just seems daunting and hard to manage effectively.",1307483836

Yeah, there would be a context switch to look at and manipulate the screen on the controller, but the same is true for using a pause-based menu.

2631045,comment,2625003,2630877,3,0,coffeemug,,,"<i>Have you considered including Redis in your benchmarks?</i><p>Yes. The trouble is that doing performance benchmarks correctly is incredibly time consuming. Most of the time people aren't actually measuring what they think they're measuring, so most benchmarks end up comparing apples to oranges. We spend a lot of time to make sure that our benchmarks measure the right things and expose the right data, at the expense of doing more benchmarks. Naturally, this requires learning a great deal about the products we're benchmarking against. We're working to automate much of this process and putting an organizational infrastructure in place to add more (hopefully almost all) competitors, but it will take some time.<p><i>Redis supports lists, sets, priority queues etc, whereas RethinkDB values can only be strings for now (if I understand correctly?). </i><p>Correct. We think of RethinkDB as a database first, and a protocol second. We've built really good, largely protocol-independent technology that allows to execute most protocols with very high performance. We think <i>that</i> part is hard, while protocols are easy (in a sense most people can implement a known protocol, but few people can build a system that makes them all run fast in the same product). We'll be adding more protocols shortly, and Redis is definitely on the list (among Cassandra, Hadoop, and beyond).<p><i>With Redis, writes are not immediately durable by default (though they can be configured that way at a performance cost), whereas with RethinkDB they are?</i><p>This is fully configurable. See here: <a href=""http://rethinkdb.com/docs/#durability"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rethinkdb.com/docs/#durability</a><p><i>Redis has built-in master-slave replication, whereas RethinkDB does not yet.</i><p>Correct. RethinkDB 1.1 (currently in QA) has full support for master-slave replication, automatic failover, and range queries (via memcached rget extension).<p><i>Redis is open-source; RethinkDB you have to pay for updates. (Will updates eventually trickle down to the free plan, or is 1.0 all she wrote for free users?)</i><p>Our strategy is to set up the pricing structure in such a way that companies that have the money and the demand will have to pay for the product, and customers that don't have the money (companies + individuals) will be able to use it for free. Getting the details on the pricing structure is difficult - we're working it out now, so I can't share the details yet.",1307483499

As an exemplar Obama promised to 'shut down Guantanamo' but once in office he was no doubt made aware of what that would entail and perhaps agreements that were already in place with other countries with respect to people being held there which made 'keeping' his promise impossible. (or at least keeping it would do more harm than not keeping it)<p>There is really only one solution, and most people give up on it before trying, that is an informed electorate. A good hacktivist system for informing the electorate would be to distill the gigabytes of data that is available in the public record for easy consumption.<p>For example create a database of every single non-classified vote in congress and the senate, for each representative maintain how they voted and links to the bills as presented. Cross connect to every admendment they have offered or voted on, every committee vote they have participated in. Every person who has ever given them or their campaign money, every organization that has ever created an advertisement for them and where they got their money. Make location based connections between visitors and their representatives.<p>There are lots and lots of databases which are now loosely connected and hard to search and manipulate. There is a UX problem as well since most of the data bases are weird or hard to talk to.<p>Imagine if you could go to this website, enter your zip code, and get a summary of everything your representative or senator or county supervisor or mayor or school district board member has been involved in since they were elected. You could pull out a document, and pick out the top three, five, ten or twenty questions you would need to know answers to in order to decide if you felt they were 'good' at their job. If you wanted to run against them you would have a good start at understanding their positions and you could go out and talk to the voters and ask if they agreed or disagreed with that.<p>You don't need 'term limits' you don't need 'manifestos' you just need people to vote and to care about what their vote means. Then you will get the government you deserve (and some of us will still want to relocate to the lunar base when it opens but that is a different rant)",1307481665

From the FAQ it sounds like there are some use cases where both Redis and RethinkDB would be suitable.  The main functional differences I can see are:<p>* RethinkDB supports datasets larger than RAM, whereas Redis doesn't really.  This could be big, for some use cases.<p>* Redis supports lists, sets, priority queues etc, whereas RethinkDB values can only be strings for now (if I understand correctly?).<p>* With Redis, writes are not immediately durable by default (though they can be configured that way at a performance cost), whereas with RethinkDB they are?  (In particular I'd like to see RethinkDB benchmarked against Redis with 'appendonly yes' and 'appendfsync always'.)<p>* Redis has built-in master-slave replication, whereas RethinkDB does not yet.<p>* Redis is open-source; RethinkDB you have to pay for updates.  (Will updates eventually trickle down to the free plan, or is 1.0 all she wrote for free users?)<p>One more question, based on your hint that ""support for more protocols is coming"".  Salvatore has said he considers Redis to be a protocol first and a database second (<a href=""http://antirez.com/post/redis-manifesto.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://antirez.com/post/redis-manifesto.html</a>).

As you said, they're not collecting significantly more than us, they just have a way simpler rate.<p>Actually, I didn't say anything about how taxes are collected.<p>However, I will point out that even when the US had significantly higher rates, the feds never managed to collect more than 22% of GDP in taxes and even those two years were ""unstable"", in that folks adjusted their behavior.<p>The sustainable maximum appears to be around 21%, and even that isn't possible during a recession.<p>> Netherlands was explained to me as ""25% up to 100k, 50% on income over that"". That's fair, simple and actually a lower rate for the vast majority of people.<p>No, it's not a lower rate for ""the vast majority"".  It's actually a significantly higher rate for the vast majority.<p>Most employed folks in the US don't pay income taxes.  They pay SS, which has very progressive payback, so it's actually a good ""investment"" for folks who don't pay income taxes.  They also pay medicare, but again, their benefits outweigh their costs.<p>So, 25% (up to 100k) would be a huge increase for most Americans.  50% is higher than the current highest marginal rate, so anyone paying it would also see an increase.<p>I don't remember where the 30% bracket kicks in, but if it's less than 100k, maybe there are some folks who'd pay less under your scheme, but they're not anywhere near a majority.<p>> Let's steal good ideas where we can.<p>I agree, but until we ""steal"" the good ideas related to efficient govt spending, better taxation is a disaster.",1307481015

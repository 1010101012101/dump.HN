4083928,comment,4082761,4083072,4,0,cooldeal,,,"You seem to be looking at this from only your narrow perspective of your own development and hosting environment.<p>There are a whole bunch of places with mixed environment where this is extremely useful and can get Node.js approved for use by management who don't want to deal with the headaches of managing, hosting, securing and administering yet another database server like MySQL or PostgreSQL when they already do that for SQL Server and want to run Node on Windows to avoid having to deal with another OS like Linux.<p>>Except, this isn't so much openness as it is an underhanded attempt at migrating more developers to their proprietary platforms<p>In these cases, aren't they helping Node get a toe in the door which can lead to further Open Source usage(which in some cases can lead to ditching of SQL Server and going to MySQL or PostgreSQL to save on licensing)?<p>>but I wish they wouldn't beat around the bush. The ""Open Source"" community that they're trying to cater to is more bullshit-averse than they seem to realize.<p>Your comment comes off as incredibly short sighted and negative. If it doesn't work for you, just move on. Where's the beating around the bush? I don't see any claims on the linked blog that they're doing this for openness. Slagging on them for making things more compatible doesn't make sense. If they make it compatible with Linux, some people will say ""they're trying to sell their stuff on Linux, it's on FOSS"". I think some people will only be happy with open sourcing SQL Server and making it absolutely free which will make them lose 95% of their revenue and I am glad Microsoft is not looking at catering to RMS.",1339160352

Say you flip a loaded coin that is 50.1% likely to be heads. Now you want to test whether this is loaded, and flip the coin a certain number of times and count the outcomes. If the number of times you flip the coin is too low, you won't be able to say the coin is 'significantly loaded'. It might be either way, you don't have enough data. If you flip it enough times, you will be able to say something about it -- i.e. that either it significantly is, or significantly isn't loaded.<p>However, in vernacular English, you would still say that the difference isn't very significant.

This new release supports setting pre-defined page sizes. Now you can render Visio diagrams to images after setting pre-defined page sizes including A4, Letter and many others. This release also supports setting the shapes Z-order. You can bring a shape to front, send it to back or place it anywhere in the Z-order. Another exciting feature this release supports is to automatically resize page to cover all the shapes. Some important fixes have also been included in this release. This release includes plenty of new and improved features as listed below<p>	Support pre-defined page sizes during image rendering.
	Ability to set shape order (bring to front, send to back etc.)
	Enhanced auto size page property 
	Text misplacement inside group shapes in Pdf rendering is fixed.
	Shapes are now maintaining the rounded corners
	Output PDF now can be read with Adobe Reader
	Error in the output PDF and XPS is resolved
	Improved adding new string properties",1339158686

Case in point is Haskell, where hundreds (thousands?) of researches have been working for years to widen the area of expression vs. area of safety. The devised language for this study seems very minimalistic to be useful. Most dynamic languages, on the other hand, pretty much let you do anything even when they have a simplistic design.<p>- I find that people take longer to become fast/useful in static languages. While you can just throw things together and tweak until it works with a dynamic language, a static one will force you more to know what you're doing. I had a semi-technical colleague who had a much much easier time getting up to speed with Python than with any other static language. Therefore, unless the study involves a long prep time, it will naturally be skewed towards lower devel time in dynamic.<p>- Static languages start shining as the project size/time-line grows. Key affected areas are refactoring, intra-team communication and incremental improvements on the code. To test for this, it would be interesting to stage a time lapse where developers are asked to modify their previous parsers after, say, a month of total separation.<p>I think a more interesting study would be to hire 20 highly decorated Python devs and 20 highly decorated Haskell devs and give them a few different computational tasks, overall adding up to a large # of hours. Naturally, the study needs to limit usage of 3-rd party libs and take other normalizing measures. Then we may get a sense for what the state-of-the-art in both fronts have to offer.",1339158129

I object to the combined operator  (x /= 2) because it is ill-conceived as a language feature.  It only works for a half-dozen cases the language writer chose.  I can't extend it to my operations. Why would I do that? Lets assume instead we define '@' as a symbol for 'LHS' (Left-Hand-Side). It now looks like this:<p><pre><code>  x = @ / 2;
</code></pre>
How does that add value?  Imagine 'x' is '<i>(int</i>)(aRec[RecIndex(p->handle)]->itemCountRef)'<p>I know, could do that already with /= 2;  But consider we wanted to do<p><pre><code>  x = x / (x+1);

No help in C.  But with '@' it becomes<p><pre><code>  *(int*)(aRec[RecIndex(p->handle)]->itemCountRef) = @ / (@+1);
</code></pre>
Much clearer than the alternative<p><pre><code>  *(int*)(aRec[RecIndex(p->handle)]->itemCountRef) = *(int*)(aRec[RecIndex(p->handle)]->itemCountRef) / (*(int*)(aRec[RecIndex(p->handle)]->itemCountRef)+1);
</code></pre>
Sure, you can add declarations of intermediate values in C now. But I'm not sure that adds clarity in the same way.",1339157507

While you're correct that a query will never give a different answer, a low TTL ensures that the name won't linger in any resolver's cache for very long, which makes it less easy to discover. This also makes the arbitrary string chosen as a subdomain particularly ephemeral, which is important when testing name-based virtual hosts. Why leave a testing domain stuck indefinitely in the cache of a resolver I don't control? I'd rather have it disappear when I'm not using it.",1339157232

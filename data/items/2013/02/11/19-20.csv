I've recently had to use Eclipse for Android dev. I agree that it'd be almost impossible to integrate the entire GUI dev framework of Eclipse Android environment in emacs (not to mention continuous compiles and other java-firic features) and that's the reason I use Eclipse for Android.\n But ""Jump to Source"" ? Emacs is a far better and faster experience for me when it comes to trolling around in big, unfamiliar code-bases. The small subtle lags with eclipse (it's not as bad now with my monster new dev machine with 16G of ram) still irritate me.

5202866,comment,5195676,5201543,0,0,jessaustin,,,"We're talking about different things here. A more productive, disease-resistant strain of soybean (or maize, rice, sweet potato, etc.) is of obvious benefit to the whole of humanity, and could be the goal of any charitable organization, philanthropist, government, or corporation. (I imagine that the increased sales of Roundup herbicide would be at best a minor criterion in the reckoning of most such institutions.) Better diabetes treatment would allow fat old Westerners to keep stuffing their gobs in relative comfort for a few more decades. I agree that no other sort of funding mechanism would be likely to bring about that latter, more dubious benefit.<p>I have no quarrel with those who bring new airplanes, soybeans, or medicines to market. I do quarrel with those who want to undermine the rule of law in society to make those efforts more profitable. For millennia farmers have replanted seeds; the activity is the basis of agriculture. Monsanto didn't own the beans this farmer planted, nor did they own the plants that bore those beans nor the elevators that stored them. They might have sold him Roundup, but if they felt they should be better rewarded for that then they should have charged him more. The court system does not exist to salve the butthurt that Monsanto executives get when their schemes of control and coercion go awry. There's entirely too much control and coercion in modern agriculture in the USA already.<p>If as a result of these proceedings Monsanto were to find that it couldn't charge a premium for its bean varieties, it might very well decide to charge a premium for its Roundup herbicide. That would change incentives in modern agriculture for the better. Instead of committing every year to excessive sunk costs for the purchase of patented seeds, which later in the season induce additional purchase of Roundup to protect that investment, farmers would be more willing to ""wait and see"" and try different combinations of weed control methods. Roundup use wouldn't cease, but it would be seen more accurately as a more expensive option and so its use would probably decrease a bit. Monsanto would be welcome to bump prices even more if they thought that would help.<p>I don't support the government even having access to billions of dollars, let alone handing them out to anyone, and I struggle to see how my initial comment could have left such an impression. I do see the extant patent regime as a pillar of modern state capitalism, which tends to reinforce the power of state bureaucrats rather than undermining it.",1360612596

In the Python world, this vulnerability has been a bit better known for a while (which is not to say that they are immune, but it's at least been common community knowledge for a very long time now, at least a decade). Pickle is well-known to have it, but it's frequently pointed out in the docs that it is possible and that you shouldn't unpickle things from users.

But it's much more involved than it sounds at first.<p>Of course a simple ""widget"" library is relatively easy to make, provided you already have powerful drawing and text functions. Then you realize, integrating text entry and copy paste consistent with the operating system gets much more tricky if you're making all your own widgets from scratch. More complex rich markup is even harder though... getting text to flow around correctly while achieving the layout you want at the same time. I think CSS does a fairly good job here, but I think we can do better.<p>A lot of the work before you even get to this stage though lies in good cross platform drawing and text rendering. OpenGL support is a 'must', of course. Then, 2D and vector graphics need to be implemented. OpenVG is supposed to provide this, but is useless as a cross platform solution, because it's only supported on a handful of mobile only systems. So I'd either have to implement all of OpenVG through OpenGL (and I certainly don't look forward to implementing the mess that is SVG) to get HW acceleration, or make my own VG library.<p>But that doesn't even solve text rendering. Text rendering western fonts is <i>relatively</i> easy, but it gets much more complex when you need to support unicode cursive fonts like Arabic with HW acceleration consistently. Fortunately the actual shape generation is already solved in the GNU world, but caching fonts efficiently on the GPU and with smooth antialiasing is another matter. It would be nice to just use the operating systems text renderer, but not only would the results be inconsistent across platforms, but I don't think it's possible to do this on an OpenGL framebuffer on all platforms.<p>So once I have HW cached text rendering, and vector graphics, only then can I even start thinking about building a widget library on top of it.<p>So it's much more complex than it initially sounds when you have to essentially reinvent the entirety of what the OS GUI API should provide. And if you can't settle for lowest-common-denominator functionality provided by all OSes, then reinventing the wheel is your only remaining option.<p>I know how to do all this, it's just a lot of work. If I was working on it full time it would go fairly quickly, but it doesn't seem to be a very profitable task so that's not feasible right now.",1360610884

If you're looking to move into a house and the insurance on it is too expensive for you, it means you can't afford that house. Flood/earthquake/volcano risk is equally as important a financial aspect of the property as its purchase price, and just like we saw with the subprime loan crisis, giving credit to those who can't afford it is generally a bad idea. Even if you're prepared to bail out all the institutions which hold that credit, you still get crises.<p>Now of course, the insurance premium scales with the price of the property, so in an area which often floods, the TCO of houses with a purchase price of X will be inflated to X * (1 + Y) (with the flood risk premium Y calculated by the underwriters based on historical data and predictive models). This means your purchasing power in a flood plain <i>should</i> have a multiple of 1/(1 + Y) compared to outside the flood plain. Basic laws of supply and demand mean that fewer people would be able to, or choose to live in such an area, and therefore the catastrophe of a flood (including the burden on the underwriters) would be lessened accordingly.<p>There once was a time where people would indeed travel great distances to improve their living situation, and I've done this myself on a few occasions, taking apartments that were much further from the area I wanted to be because the rents on the more central places were too expensive for me. The idea that people have a human right to be able to afford whatever they want, subsidized by everyone else, is a <i>very</i> recent idea indeed, and it's one which I feel isn't standing up to the test of time.<p>In terms of healthcare, a great analogy to 'flood plains' would be people who continuously put their life and limb at risk by engaging in acts which are well-known to be harmful: smoking, excessive unhealthy eating, and substance abuse. My point is illustrated by the prolonged debate in countries with socialized healthcare on how to treat smokers, the obese, and drug addicts. It's by no means a solved problem, but my point is that you can't refer to the example of publicly-subsidized insurance of individuals who take above-average risks as an example of why we need more of that exact same thing.",1360610658

We were testing latency of MIDI interfaces, and after sanity checking by looking at some of the underlying data, realized that average, or even average+stddev, was obscuring a lot of stuff. For example, note-to-note consistency is a major issue in music interfaces, often more important than absolute latency, since the spacing between notes is very important to melody perception (games often have a similar issue).<p>Showing the full histogram isn't a full solution either, though. Not only does using the average latency obscure the issue by boiling it down to a single scalar, but the full histogram of latencies also loses the information on note-to-note consistency! That's because a latency histogram loses sequencing information, so it doesn't distinguish between the case where you had a lot of 20ms latencies in a row followed by a lot of 50ms latencies in a row, and the case where every other message oscillated between 20ms and 50ms latencies (much worse). You can try to capture some of that information by making a histogram of adjacent-latency deltas, as one attempt.

House of Cards is one of the first major test cases of this Big Data-driven creative strategy. For almost a year, Netflix executives have told us that their detailed knowledge of Netflix subscriber viewing preferences clinched their decision to license a remake of the popular and critically well regarded 1990 BBC miniseries. Netflixs data indicated that the same subscribers who loved the original BBC production also gobbled down movies starring Kevin Spacey or directed by David Fincher. Therefore, concluded Netflix executives, a remake of the BBC drama with Spacey and Fincher attached was a no-brainer, to the point that the company committed $100 million for two 13-episode seasons.",1360610600

If this were really true we would already have government provided health insurance everywhere because private insurers would have gone bankrupt long ago.<p>Flood insurance is fundamentally different from health insurance because floods cause large losses for large numbers of people at the same time (i.e. highly correlated incidence of losses). This means the insurer or insurers would have to make a huge payout in the event of a flood. If this payout is greater than all their resources, then everyone can't fully rebuild their home.<p>Most people can't afford to rebuild their home if it is destroyed because they do not have the resources. Similarly private insurers simply can't afford to rebuild everyone's home at the same time. And while some insurers might be willing to take the risk any responsible regulator should stop them.<p>Governments are often the only entities with the enormous resources to make these huge payouts. Therefore we have an vaild argument for the government providing flood or earthquake insurance.<p>Health issuance is entirely different because large health expenses do not occur to large numbers of people at the same time. Health insures are not going bankrupt because of flu epidemics. Instead they set their rates to cover these predictable payouts as well as generate a profit.<p>Unlike rebuilding an entire home most health expenses are affordable by most patients. It is only occasionally that the required treatment is so expensive that we need a third party to pay for it. In some countries this is done by private insurers and providers and in some it is done by governments.<p>While this is not a good argument for government health insurance there are many. Unfortunately this is a very complex area requiring expertise in many areas: insurance, economics, regulation, politics... and perhaps even software development.",1360610403

People aren't perfectly rational utility-seekers. They won't get up and move away from Winnipeg to avoid a flood. Likewise, they won't flood across the border into Canada to get our health care. You can say there aren't enough jobs or something, but the fact is we take as many immigrants as we possibly can these days, we'd love to have lots of Americans.<p>But they don't come to Canada. So one explanation is that people aren't perfectly rational in the sense that would drive them to seek out better health care or to move away from Winnipeg. Once you accept that, you can accept that people might not like the idea of spreading the cost of health care across a population through taxation. Never mind if I think it's rational, I also think it's rational to move off a flood plain.<p>Or any of a dozen other explanations for why it might not work in the US. It might not!

History is always there, no ridiculous kissing smiley faces (hello Skype), no ridiculous out of sync notifications that are months old (hello Skype). We've been beta testing it for about a month and it's been making our lives easier and communication clearer. The support is right on. The speed with which the Lechat team adds useful features is phenomenal. Never at expense of quality. Would love to see the native clients, and they say they're coming soon. I absolutely totally recommend it. Try it out!",1360609228

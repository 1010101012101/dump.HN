All are very pleasant to hang out with in real life. None do that kind of shit in real life.<p>The internet can bring out the worst in people.<p>I basically go on there once a week or once every two weeks to catch up on the &quot;news&quot; or if I get a message from someone (usually extended family, I have a lot) or an event invite. Unfortunately the narcissism is prominent because its &quot;like&quot; and &quot;comment&quot; bait. :| You could say these people aren&#x27;t really my friends but, whatever, they like to use facebook to announce things (new job) because its easier than messaging everyone directly. Its also nice to get event invites from people you don&#x27;t know very well who may otherwise not invite you because they don&#x27;t know your phone number. Those are opportunities to make new friends. The barrier to getting to know someone better is low. That&#x27;s nice.<p>Over the years we&#x27;ve spread out geographically so I can&#x27;t see them face to face very often but I do as much as I can. (every few months)<p>Its easy to say only engage people who &quot;enrich your life&quot; in all aspects of it and are 100% perfect but humans are not perfect and facebook caters to a deep human need for attention/group acceptance. I also believe that surrounding yourself with people exactly like you in every way isn&#x27;t very healthy. There&#x27;s a lot of people that I don&#x27;t like at all and I avoid if possible but for the people I do like I tolerate the differences we may have.<p>I don&#x27;t have a use for pages or whatever they call them or anything like that.<p>I could get rid of my facebook but its alright for the amount I use but I couldn&#x27;t stand being on that shit every day.",1447516734

What mitchellh describes for PHP (taking his example) is something that Cloud Foundry already does: take a codebase, apply heuristics to build and package it, then pass it off to a runtime. Heroku and OpenShift do it too.<p>The thing is that you&#x27;re worried about snowflake deployment. You&#x27;re still in the mindset that your app deserves special treatment; if it doesn&#x27;t stage and launch using community-accepted best practices, then the platform is to blame.<p>I disagree. If your app needs zany configurations just to launch, I think that&#x27;s a smell.<p>From time to time on buildpacks we would receive bug reports of the form &quot;my app doesn&#x27;t work&quot;. Usually, upon closer inspection, there was an easier fix: follow best practices.<p>The thing to remember about PaaSes like Cloud Foundry, Heroku, OpenShift and now Otto is that they are opinionated by design. The goal is not to provide an infinite supply of knobs and dials. We tried that with mod_perl, with PHP, with Java.

One reason people do things like those which happened in Paris is due to the fact that these people are not integrated into a friendly, peaceful society. Thus they feel a void and need to fill it with something that gives them a sense of power and belonging. Technology can be used to enable people to create meaning for themselves. For Instance, the advent of digital music production enabled people who couldn&#x27;t play a &quot;real&quot; instruments in the olden days to express themselves musically now. I know a guy who used to get into fights at night clubs until the day I introduced Cubase to him!<p>And even if these individuals are not strong enough to do something productive technology could at least give them a glimpse of power and belonging in online communities. For example, a person who is busy playing WoW all day won&#x27;t get to shooting someone in the streets.<p>What I wrote above is, unfortunately, hugely idealistic. More realistically I see two options for this problem:<p>1. don&#x27;t just bomb targets but level the ground.\nThis is of course not something we actually want to do because it would kill many innocent people. Still from an unempathetic point of view: Is killing millions of people now worse than eventually allowing <made up stat>twice as many people to be killed over the comming decades</made up stat>? instead:<p>2. We have to fucking evolve and acknowledge that they found a bug in our system and &quot;we are the best, democracy rules, those guys are in the wrong - why are they so mean?&quot; as well as a couple of bombs simply don&#x27;t cut it anymore. Instead, we should come off our high horses and work our ass off to address the (political, cultural, economical) domains OP mentions so that we can leave our current conception of the world behind us and progress to something that serves us better in the coming years. However, this is radical and it is hard to make a society move into this direction as all of us would have to question everything we do.\nMaybe finding time for teaching refugees your language for free is more important than working longer hours so that you contribute to pushing the GDP. Maybe moderate Muslims should do more to prevent those attacks even though it is neither their fault not their responsibility to do anything about it. Maybe the &quot;average customer&quot; should be more mindful when s/he goes shopping by making sure that s/he doesn&#x27;t support supply chains which somehow benefit terror supporters.

Whatever monitoring you&#x27;re doing, you&#x27;re proposing to find on the order of a few hundred people, if that. False positives (which, remember: we cannot distinguish from actual positives) would end up targeting orders of magnitude more innocent people than guilty.<p>Worse, by breaking the compact of a free and just society with respect to a single religious group (<i>cough</i>), you&#x27;re basically doing the terrorists&#x27; jobs for them - you end up marginalizing and disenfranchising huge swaths of your population (remember again: millions of people in France alone). Even if one is not not ethically and morally appalled by your proposal, the problem remains: your proposal would probably contribute <i>more</i> to radicalization than any other single action the terrorists themselves could take.<p>It is at a time like this when we most need to stick to the principles of a free, just, and open society. We need to re-affirm those, and I say that as an American who has lived through the post-911 transition into a security society. Learn from our mistakes: we&#x27;ve gone and made people <i>more</i> radical, spent <i>more</i> civilian and military lives, because as a nation we somehow thought we could fix the &quot;muslim problem&quot; through fighting and surveillance. Neither worked.<p>What will (eventually) work is working toward a nation and a world where all people are free and equal. Sure, there may still be attacks against such a nation, but that&#x27;s what police are for (when the police are also just and equal). Furthermore, it&#x27;s a <i>lot</i> harder to radicalize people when they live in a safe and just society that pays attention to them. I&#x27;m not surprised at all, given how non-muslim westerners have treated the religion and people, that we are seeing radicalized people.<p>And aaaaalso, this bears mentioning although it&#x27;s kind of tangential. Not all muslims are brown. Not all muslims speak bad english / french. Consider all the work Imperial Japan did to wipe out christianity (you can&#x27;t tell a religion by looking at someone), and all they did was make it stronger and drive it underground.<p>Consider: in the US, actually, the biggest terrorist threats come from white people. White people of the white-supremacy and militant-anti-abortion camps are responsible for far more terrorist attacks on US soil than ISIS and al-qaeda combined. We, as a nation, just don&#x27;t really like to talk about surveiling all white people.

Why are there terrorist attacks? Saying &quot;religious nuttery&quot; achieves nothing. Nuttery always exists but is in majority not enough to push people to suicide bombings. Terrorist attacks exist because of political power and influence. They&#x27;re efficient, because we let them be efficient.<p>Compare it to the drug trade. [Cartels|terrorist cults] thrive because there is [money|power] to be made. Going after the [cartels|terrorists] is not enough long term. [Jailing|Discriminating against] [potheads|muslims] only serves to worsen the situation for them, pushing them even further out of society, but does nothing to solve the problem. Criminalizing the components such as [drugs|encryption] only makes the problem worse for your citizens, doesn&#x27;t affect the bad guys. You need to take care of the problem at the root by removing the bad guys&#x27; incentives.<p>In the case of terrorist cults, religion is a mask. It&#x27;s just whatever&#x27;s currently marginalizing people as much as possible. You see, marginalized people make for excellent subjects. Just like any other cult, they prey on the weak. They prey on the ones who are feeling alone, those feeling rejected by everybody even their own country. Those who have nowhere else to go find a place they&#x27;re taken care of, where they&#x27;re cheaply promised great rewards (in the afterlife) and where they can find a purpose. Not just that, but somewhere they can take revenge on the country that hates them.<p>&quot;Muslim&quot; terrorists know quite well that their attacks only make the lives of muslims worse. They only serve to get them more subjects so they can get even more political power.<p>So you want an idea? You take care of that problem. You start teaching others about how those cults <i>really</i> work - know your enemy. You make people understand that more hatred, more blood, are exactly what the terrorists want. That&#x27;s why we call them terrorists: Politics through terror.\nEducation. Teaching to be more critical of media - media has complete control over the narrative through most mediums, and as long as some media outlets stand to gain from instilling fear of your neighbour, they&#x27;ll keep doing it and readers will not be any less impressionable for it.<p>I dunno, maybe it&#x27;ll make a difference.

For those unaware, the game happens in 2 stages.  &quot;champ select&quot; during which everyone decides on the role and character they&#x27;re going to play, and then the game itself.  If you leave during champ select you get a penalty before you can rejoin a game.  First dodged game is 5 minutes, every subsequent dodge is 30 minutes (resets 24 hours after your first dodge).<p>Because champ select + game tends to last an hour and a dodge only lasts 30 minutes, you save time by dodging and waiting.  It gets more subtle than that, in that your teammates might get angry at you halfway through the game and then decide to purposefully lose the game for you.  Because of this, it becomes an art to determine how much risk you have of wasting time going into a game.<p>So there&#x27;s these guides running around about how to determine when to dodge as a means of climbing rank (most people will tell you that learning when to dodge is absolutely a skill necessary for climbing quickly).<p>This is all a result of Riot&#x27;s decision not to give players a means of extricating themselves from these games in a reasonable manner coupled with too much leniency in ranked games with respect to people who do this sort of thing.<p>What happens a lot of times is people get really angry because they end up wasting 3 or 4 hours from these trolls in a single day.  A 17 year old off for the summer can play 10+ games a day, a 25 year old with a job cannot, and so that 25 year old can often get very frustrated when he loses multiple games in a row due to trolls.

Offer courses in the native language of migrant children, to make sure they are not left behind and drop out early. Make sure that every student has a grown up at school that they can talk to, that they relate to.<p>Next, housing. Rents in most european cities are skyrocketing. I assume that this is caused by the current low interests rates, which lead to more and more people to use real estate as an investment. Low interest rates also make credit cheap, increasing the amount people can pay for housing, again increasing prices. This means that even the middle class is struggling to afford housing, and people working low income jobs have to live in very low quality housing, in poor areas. Fixing this is probably not easy, and probably requires a number of unpopular measures like rent control, or subsidised housing (for example you could require real estate developers to offer a percentage of affordable appartements when they apply for a permit to construct a new building).<p>Also, jobs. I really don&#x27;t know how to fix this. A starting point would probably be to require minimum wages even for contract employees, or better to outlaw the current practices of hiring people as &quot;independent contractors&quot; instead of proper employees.<p>Anyway, these are just some suggestions. Note that all these measures are about helping people, rather than harassing them. Happy people don&#x27;t become terrorists, and happy people don&#x27;t need to be put under surveillance.",1447513589

Interest rates are effectively zero because everyone (governments, businesses, citizens...) is carrying all the debt they can handle.  If they try to raise the interest rates the entire world will go bankrupt.  As usual, Bloomberg points the finger at bank regulation.  The banks should never have survived the 2008 crash, but $2.5Trillion buys you a lot of time.  Remember, all that QE went to pay down financial sector losses from the crash.

A good real estate agent knows everything about the area they service.  What areas have bad reputations and crime scores but are perfectly safe? What areas have development plans in the works? What are the local laws and ordinances, how does that affect your purchase? How difficult is it to get permits for types of work?  Are residents fleeing an area because of upcoming re-zoning that isn&#x27;t well published? They&#x27;ll have a vast network of trusted service professionals that can help you renovate.  They will know little things like which HOA has unreasonable board members or which homes keep going up for sale because the next door neighbor is crazy.<p>On top of all that small but invaluable information a good real estate agent will make the process of buying your home smoother.  I don&#x27;t think many people have an appreciation for how difficult it is to manage a title company, the seller&#x27;s agent, three attorneys, a loan officer and the bank.  Contrary to popular belief it is not always in the best interest for them to all work together.  In some cases one or several of those parties my have a vested interest in slowing the process down or killing the deal completely.",1447513269

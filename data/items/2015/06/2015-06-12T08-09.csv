9704728,comment,9702372,9703468,0,0,saiya-jin,,,"nice writing and all, but sir you have no first hand clue about corporations. not everybody is using new cool toys of the day as backbone of their whole company. For example i work at the bank, the whole core banking package is basically app build in pl/sql on top of oracle db. 
i like cool new technologies, but to even think they would run in next 20 years anything else than their super-cluster is funny and ridiculous, and... stupid. 
Some non-critical apps like HR, timesheets and whatnot? Sure, have it in SAP (why isn&#x27;t anybody discussing this super massive pile of crap? compared to that, oracle&#x27;s offerings are slick cool lean easy-to-use tiny gadgets).

First of all - we&#x27;re programming in Perl 5.21 and because of this we made coding standards to ensure people will code in simmilar manner. Second - we have mailing list where summary of all commits is send - code, reason, project description etc. Every developer is allowed to read those commits and if he find anything suspicious - he can rand code check (or wtf) message and authour of questioned code has to respond (either by correcting his code or explaining why he did what he did). Third - we do partial reviews during project. Whenever sprint is finished - there goes minireview. Fourth - after project is finished - there is inner team project code review, where developers take step back and look themselves on their and theirs teammates code. Fifth - when inner-team review is finished and all issues are fixed - there is outer-team review. Senior Engineer or Software Architect is appointed to overview whole code, but at this point any developer from any team is allowed to join outer-team review.<p>Leading reviewer after finishing his work decide about eventual after-fix review (if something was really messed up despite all precautions).<p>And - just for sure - before releasing code to production releasing architect take quick eye look on git diff.

Optimizing around the current fashion is generally a mistake.<p>I think this invokes the invention vs. discovery debate. There are many &quot;design patterns&quot; in Haskell, some of which might be regarded as clever inventions (for example conduits and pipes), in which case I agree that there&#x27;s an element of &quot;fashion&quot; involved, which leads to incompatibilities and churn.<p>However, Monad and Applicative are clear examples of <i>discoveries</i>. Even if we try to write code without them, the pattern will still be lurking in there somewhere. Applicative is basically a &quot;static&quot; data-flow graph; ie. the graph is fixed, data flows through. Monad is a &quot;dynamic&quot; graph; parts of the graph can be generated from the data. These patterns will still be present, even if we use a completely different language.",1434099063

This is similar to spec work (e.g. the result will typically be discarded unless it is exceptionally good and solves real-world problems) but typically you will be reimbursed if you are not hired.<p>For a programming job you may be given a task that doesn&#x27;t require intimate knowledge of any of the company&#x27;s codebases but should give some insights into how you work, followed by a short review.<p>It&#x27;s important to note that this doesn&#x27;t scale well. It works best if the candidate works on site and can work alongside future team mates, which may impact the team&#x27;s productivity for the duration. This approach works best for small to medium scale companies with a small pool of viable candidates. It&#x27;s beneficial for the company to only send a candidate through this process if they&#x27;re very likely to hire them.<p>I actually prefer this approach. By the time you&#x27;re invited for &quot;Probearbeiten&quot; both sides are fairly confident you&#x27;re going to be hired and it gives both sides a chance to determine whether it&#x27;s a good fit.<p>It should also be noted that even in companies that don&#x27;t do &quot;Probearbeiten&quot; there&#x27;s a trial period (&quot;Probezeit&quot;) <i>after</i> you&#x27;re hired of up to six months where you&#x27;re pretty much employed &quot;at will&quot; and can be fired on the spot.",1434097762

9704603,comment,9703018,9703524,0,0,briandear,,,"Mla48 isn&#x27;t the creator. They&#x27;re a middleman between the company and te money. It&#x27;s not a direct comparison with drug manufacturers. in terms of patent protection, how much can of the drug does the government actually fund? The drug company is still assuming risk by developing the drug despite some grant funding. What I would suggest is that grant-funded research include a provision that the drug be provided at cost to the government if it were successful. This would allow the company to profit privately but it would also benefit the public. This would actually work as a clever disincentive to reduce the reliance on government money and thus resulting in an opportunity to lower taxes. I don&#x27;t want to pay taxes for Merck to make a billion dollar drug. Merck can assume that risk themselves. However many of the government programs are for Orphan drugs which would not have been produced otherwise. These drugs typically result in no or minimal profit to the manufacturer, thus a need for government help. Patent protection is essential for these drugs: if you patient population is 500; if someone steals your drug, you have still lost money despite the government assistance. Grants don&#x27;t cover the full cost of drugs or research, thus a patent is important ther wise drug companies would not assume the finial risk for a reward that would be immediately eliminated. You&#x27;d have drug vultures: companies that would wait until someone else does all the work, then they swoop in and manufacturer and market the drug. Imagine if Stephen King had no copyright protection; he would not have had a career writing books; he&#x27;d probably be teaching English at some small New England prep school instead of entertaining millions.",1434096632

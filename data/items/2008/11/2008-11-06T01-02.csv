355274,comment,355164,355263,0,0,timcederman,,,"Maybe. I had a string of pretty crappy hotels, so started paying more attention to the reviews and noticed that although the hotels I had been staying at had higher averages, they had a lot less 5 star ratings.  Next few hotels were much better, and when the option to get a hotel with a better curve wasn't available, I was appropriately disappointed.  While I would like to think that I don't suffer from confirmation bias, this certainly isn't a double blind trial.<p>I have also seen a similar phenomenon with restaurants on Yelp though, which has been slightly easier to test in that I can try two similar restaurants with the different shaped curves.",1225936341

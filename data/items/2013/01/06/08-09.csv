5015827,comment,5014300,5015727,1,0,12characters,,,"> How hard would it be to write mathematical proofs in a modular way? And have someone check a ""module"" of a proof and someone else another ""module"" and so on?<p>To a large extent, this is what we do. But of course, modules by themselves don't prove a thing about what we're originally interested in so that not one module can stand by itself as any advance in the proof, that theconclusion of any module of the proof are surely needed for all the others modules to make sense and that these conclusions are more often than not formulated in a new part of language (new words, concepts, and rules to play with them) introduced in said module. Parallel work of the sort I infer you have in mind might be possible in some instances, but there is so very few of them in my opinion that it's just not worth trying.<p>> ...and for the bits that's possible, write in a subset of mathematical language that computer can check, or at least partially check and ask the human reviewer for feedback on the parts that can't be automatically proven.<p>No can't do: in mathematical writing, what is actually written is the tip of a gigantic iceberg of implied reasoning and background scenery. There might be a way to make computer understand this, but as far as I know it has yet to be found. That, and making explicit what is not in mathematical writing would make the length of any proof grow manymanyfold - and I actually mean manymany....manyfold.",1357462271

E.g ""First I will map the integers into a group defined by X and Y, it makes the work easier because that group has some interesting properties like... Then I show how the Goldback conjecture translates onto my group, then, etc.""<p>I know this is easier to be said than to be done, but on the other hand the Goldback conjecture is so simple that there have to be ways to break down its demonstration (or attempts of) into understandable steps, each steps being once again broken down, etc. and each stage introducing new layers of complexity. That way, instead of claiming ""I proved the Goldback conjecture, here is the proof, just check those 1000 pages"", he could have said ""I proved X, Y and Z, and we can see how together they can be added up to prove the actual conjecture"", with X, Y and Z (and probably lots of others) being smaller results that experts could challenge or assert.<p>EDIT: TL;DR: If a mathematician claims to prove a long time unproven claim such as Goldbach conjecture, it belongs to him to do the vulgarisation works so even schmucks like me can have a remove idea of how he did it.",1357461847

Thinkpads have evolved to a point where - regardless of IBM or Lenovo being the brand behind the product line - the name is a synonym of dependability and quality. I think that by separating the brand from the rest of the Lenovo pack, and giving it it's own two feet they might steal quite a bit of Apple's customers.<p>I went from my own homemade machines, to exclusively Apple hardware, to owning a t420 (wanted the old keyboard). I'm in the process of leaving the Apple ecosystem and going back to Linux (Arch to be specific) because I dislike the direction Apple is going (the Mac App Store was the inflection point that made me want to leave). The Thinkpad brand was the obvious choice because of upgradeability, quality, dependency, and the fact that they make some of the best laptops for Linux. Even better than Zareason and system 76 hardware IMO. Making the perfect business computing tools AND at the same time the perfect Linux portable hardware is a big plus in my book. Even more than unibody pieces of aluminum and the retina bs that while commendable to a point, I've found is more of a nuisance than anything else.<p>Anyways, Lenovo earned a customer by keeping the Thinkpad brand alive and maintaining it's quality standards.

Some of recent findings in cognitive science has given credence to this approach. If anyone is interested here is the link to one of the research papers.<p><a href=""http://uweb.rc.usf.edu/~drohrer/pdfs/Taylor&Rohrer2010ACP.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://uweb.rc.usf.edu/~drohrer/pdfs/Taylor&Rohrer2010AC...</a><p>I think memorization doesn't really help understand the fundamentals of any topic. Rote memorization can only get you so far. As concepts get harder and complex, dependence on mere memorization leaves a lot of holes in the understanding of any subject matter.<p>Specifically in programming, syntax or semantics form just a minor part of overall problem solving exercise. Efficient and effective programming requires repeated use of concepts or paradigms in solutions for diverse problems. Our brain is much more effective in registering and recalling facts or knowledge when that piece of knowledge is exercised in diverse scenarios.<p>I am a co-founder of Lymboo Math (<a href=""http://www.lymboo.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lymboo.com</a>), an online math practice program for elementary school children. We built the curriculum that follows the natural learning sequence of math concepts. On top of the comprehensive curriculum we implemented a practice structure that relies on interleaved and spaced practice. Students practice daily on individual topics until they are proficient in that topic. Then they move on to subsequent topics along the prerequisites-based curriculum. Throughout the program the system automatically incorporates spiral reviews of previous topics at regular intervals of time to effectively cement all the acquired knowledge.<p>What we have found is that children easily forget what they have learned just a weeks earlier, and their performance degrades in the initial mixed spiral reviews. However, as they continue the cycle of (learn--practice--review)*, they show improved performance in subsequent spiral reviews.<p>Mixed spiral reviews model interleaved (mix of topics) and spaced (in time) practice to enhance our context-switching skills. The neurons in the brain make new connections and store patterns that aid in quick and fluent recall of knowledge.<p>Interleaved and spaced learning techniques are more than just for memorization.",1357461205

There is no difficulty in writing such wrappers - it is just a closure which return another closure which accepts ""messages"", and following some protocol, returns, for example, another closures to be called for a certain action (generators, iterators, etc.)<p>We could teach the read function to recognize any kind of wired syntax we wish, and constructing appropriate data-structures with type-tags attached to them. But it will become a mess.<p>The real data-structures, however, its representation is very different thing. In Clojure, I suppose, it is based on built-in Java types and generic interfaces, such as Iterable or whatever it is. So, they are ordinary Java objects, without any magic in it.<p>In Scheme or CL it depends on the implementation, the choices made by developers. So, for example, Gambit-C and MIT Scheme are quite different in how they implement hash-tables or vectors. My guess is that, say Alegro CL and CMUCL are also very different, yet they all conform to some standards (CLtL2, ANSI).<p>Having very different implementations with different set of  compromises is a strength.<p>So, in my opinion, there is absolutely nothing special in this syntactic constructions, moreover, it is not that difficult to implement them using closures and macroses. In arc.arc you could see how strings and tables were implemented.<p>Another issue is, should we add all this wired syntax to what we call Lisp? In my opinion doing this ruins Lisp and the result is some very different in a look-and-feel language. Calling it Lisp is, well, confusing, at least to me. Arc is a Lisp, no doubt. CL and Scheme are Lisps, for sure. Clojure is Java with lisp-like syntax, if you wish.)<p>The old rules says that there must be very heavy reasons to add any new symbol or a keyword into a language, and that the same things shall look the same, and different - differently. For me, personally, Arc is a proper approach, while Clojure is, well, a mess.)",1357460654

Even if it's badly designed, even if it's not well made, you will probably remember it in the same time frame. Maybe a little slower but not much. That's the flexibility of the humain brain for you. It's not picky at all.\nI'm a C++ programmer but I remember myself learning and remembering the PHP functions very fast a few years ago. The PHP library is just a bunch of stuff put together and yet I still remember a lot of them today. Even the parameter names.\nEven in spoken languages this applies. In French, you have to memorize the spelling of every word if you want to write without making too many mistakes because the spelling of most of the words doesn't make any sense sometimes. Sometimes the word is coherent with the sound, sometimes the word has mute characters, sometimes the word is bizzare because it comes from Old French... You have to remember everything.

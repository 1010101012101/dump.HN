4163825,comment,4162488,4163560,7,0,tigerBL00D,,,"Phill, parsing has little to do with what goes on at query execution time. Parsing is typically done once for a given parameterized query (and MemSQL automatically parameterizes queries with constants). After parsing comes compilation which produces a query plan. The query plan is cached and that is the thing that is actually used to evaluate the query when it's re-submitted again. We are discussing the differences in how MemSQL handles executing compiled queries. Executing compiled queries is what a (well tuned) database spends most of its time doing. It is the hot code path. And if you cut the instruction count in half you can expect latency to decrease proportionally and throughput to increase.<p>You are making all these skeptical claims that are technically wrong. I suggest you download MemSQL, compile a query and read the generated C++ code. Then download MySQL source and look at that too. At that point you will be coming to your own conclusions and I'll be happy to resume this debate.",1340740662

He let his disciples sit when they had nothing to do. What he guided them to practice is not to do with breath, nor concentration, nor compassion. But much more concretely, he taught to try to pursue and then confirm the reality of what you've heard, and that you should only allow yourself to accept the reality once you've confirmed. Confirmation is essential because people can easily deceive themselves when they misunderstand something.<p>If there's anyone who opened eyes to reality through meditation, you should ask them concrete questions about things in the reality to verify. They probably have understood the term reality as one experience, state, or object, which is the indication that they are being deceived by someone/something. You'll have to verify case-by-case to be sure.<p>Reality can be defined as the set of results which are determined to appear from the problems that things in the world have. Because these results are determined in a fixed principle, someone who knows Buddha's teaching can easily recognize an discuss any field of study at length without difficulty, even if they've never studied it before, because they can realize how it works and thus recognize the problems (matters) involved in the field through the person they're talking to.<p>Hope this helps.

It is a 'fair' and direct approach: you have made a product, you sell it, you get the money. (Meanwhile, they are also getting money from Android devices using some patent agreement, but it is a different question.) Google have been making the free Android OS using the money they have earned from their main business (also they use open source, but it is also a different question). Hardly Android is a charity project, eventually it brings profit to Google by significantly increasing traffic to their search engine and services. So Android is obviously commercial, though indirectly. It seems to me that this is a classic case of predatory pricing being commited by Google over Microsoft: Google uses money from their main business to make a free competing product. I can imagine a correspoding example with tangible entities: what if the BMW company decided to produce scooters and give them away with no profit taking finance for the production from their car business, thus killing the scooter market and becoming the monopolist. This would be an immediate case for the authorities such as the Federal Trade Commission to take action. For me this example is the same situation as with Google and Microsoft.

4163759,comment,4163124,4163652,2,0,blueprint,,,"Good question.<p>Enlightenment, in the context you mentioned, indicates that you abandon one consciousness and get a new one.<p>However, what happens through meditation is not the same as that and it has a different point than Enlightenment - meditation is an activity for changing your mind, and the result of modern meditation is that your mind gets darker and you can lose yourself. People can see lots of illusions in the darkness of their minds, and within a relatively short period of time through meditation they can make contact with some very strange phenomena.<p>What is the source of the strange phenomena in their consciousness? It can happen because they contacted an external consciousness. If the practitioner is weak-willed, the wandering consciousness will enter them immediately and can push their own consciousness out of the way and just drive their body. At that moment, they will show a different kind of behavior, oftentimes claiming knowledge of something that they didn't see with their own eyes (what they don't know).<p>When the other spirit enters them, their own consciousness just becomes dormant and feels less of a burden so people mistake this for nirvana and peace. People don't recognize this about themselves and only try to change their mind through meditation because they don't know the structure of consciousness and how the mind is generated. The fact is that people's consciousness doesn't change very much without Enlightenment, so no matter how much they practice meditation they won't be able to know Buddha's teachings until they open their eyes to how the world works.<p>There are two things in the core of consciousness - karma, and virtue. If you have more karma it makes your mind darker, and if you have less Karma and more virtue (conscience), it makes your mind brighter. This happens because what you have done gets input into yourself again.\nBecause people have their own karma, they have their own perspectives and perceptive ability, but can't easily find out what result in their life comes from what questions they have because they can't see what causes lie in themselves and what kind of problems they have. That's why we need a good teacher. Buddha noted that common people always see things in the exact opposite way, and it's because they have karma.<p>On the other hand, an Enlightened one can realize what is in the actuality because he burned out his karma completely and doesn't use his mind to perceive the world. As a result of stopping and removing his karma, he can recover his own consciousness, and if he can keep his life then he comes to attain his Enlightenment through his life activities teaching what he can see. It's through this teaching that Enlightenment is attained, but until now this teaching hasn't been passed down properly.<p>So the reason why meditation doesn't work to produce Enlightenment is that it's not a way to recover and save oneself - it's a way to abandon oneself and never be reborn. It's the exact opposite of Buddha's teaching!",1340739652

I would put an emphasis on suggesting how to decide on a fair price. Many people don't have any sense of price or negotiation, and could get 'bored' because they don't want to take a second to think about what something is really worth to them--or conversely, they get bored when they start over-thinking about what its really worth to them.<p>On a side note, have you considered adding some sort of price-check input for bidders to report other outlets that offer lower prices?

People actually discover restaurants via word of mouth or local search (Google usually). Great food, SEO, marketing, PR, guest care, etc. matter a lot more than being in one particular portal. See studies about restaurant discovery.<p>Myth #2: their guest information is locked into OpenTable. It isn't. You can export your guest database with phone numbers (if collected) and email (if they opt-in). While it may sound like they are missing something if they can't export email addresses (unless they opt-in), it isn't. They can't email those guests through OpenTable either.<p>Myth #3: guests care a lot about points. This is a smaller, sub-population of the restaurant going public. Most people don't care, they just want the ease of booking online when they want, which is generally 2/3rds of the time outside of the restaurant's hours (see poll by OpenTable).<p>Generally, those people that use points a lot (or discounts) are not great customers either (see any study about Groupon discounting).<p>Why would you want to give your guest a discount to eat at another restaurant anyways?<p>Anyways, if you are interested in more restaurant reservation analysis feel free to check out my Quora account:<p><a href=""http://www.quora.com/Chris-Butler-7/answers"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.quora.com/Chris-Butler-7/answers</a><p>Also, check out Complete Seating (<a href=""http://completeseating.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://completeseating.com</a>) an OpenTable alternative I work on!",1340738437

No one likes to take it on the chin, but sometimes you have to step back, look at how hard the hit is, and decide if you <i>really</i> want to get in to a brawl over the matter.<p>Think of this as a judgement call. IMO, it shows either lack of preparedness or poor judgement on the part of the freelancer in this case. When you run your own business, the buck stops at you. In any given scenario, you must be willing to accept your portion of the responsibility. It has been my experience that the more responsibility someone is willing to accept, the better they are at getting things done. It's a pretty good indicator of success. Those who always look to push the burden of responsibility off on others will dwindle their time looking everyone but at themselves.<p>I'm not saying that the freelancer is 100% responsible here, but I am saying that it doesn't matter much. If your goal is to be successful, you can't be distracted by these stupid little hiccups. You have to get up, dust yourself off, and move on.",1340737936

There are some extremely volatile liquid and plastic explosives that would take your leg off if you dropped [1][2]. Or if they were used as primary explosives to ignite a more powerful secondary explosive.  That could be disastrous if TSA allowed liquids in larger quantities.<p>As for the detection technologies that are currently out on the market, all I have to say is that every single one of them can be confused and circumvented, which is why they have seemingly arbitrary rules.  For example, xray technologies can easily confuse plastic explosives with a piece of cheese, which is why you have to take shit out of your bag.  MMW wave technologies are confused by water substances, which is why you have to do a pat down if an anomaly is detected.<p>My own technology that I worked on was primarily developed as a low-cost surface technique, so if you had explosive residue on your hands or baggage our detector would alarm.<p>[1]<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitroglycerin"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitroglycerin</a>\n[2]<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oa6fcun3kag"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oa6fcun3kag</a>",1340737892

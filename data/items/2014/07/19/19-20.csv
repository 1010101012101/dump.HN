If you had your way, and the US government ceased issuing H-1B visas, you&#x27;d see a significant drop in EB-based green card applications. Far fewer companies would be applying for them. That&#x27;s because, under the current system, an H-1B allows a company to <i>temporarily</i> hire someone, assess their performance, and decide whether they <i>really want to sponsor them for permanent residence</i>. You&#x27;d likely get lower-quality immigrants (as the companies haven&#x27;t had a chance to fully assess them), and most likely would disproportionately favor mutlinational companies with offices elsewhere.<p>If you don&#x27;t fix the system first, you&#x27;ll end up with a even more broken immigration system. (I&#x27;m sure anti-immigrant types would love that though.)<p>If you want to fix things, fight for an easier pathway for skilled immigrants to come to the US (like an easier/quicker route to permanent residency), <i>before fighting to shut down</i> what is currently the sole vehicle to the U.S. for the vast majority of people who receive EB-based green cards.",1405799982

It&#x27;s not what you&#x27;d call good now, but it&#x27;s way better.<p>Ultimately I&#x27;d have less objection to the governments keeping data if I saw the benefits from them doing it.

However, any and all responses to the questions I asked would be highly valued (I put all my questions below the essay I regurgitated). The people here have all my respect, HN community is the best community.<p>A little background:<p>There&#x27;s a security firm in the town I live that I&#x27;ve been bugging, politely, for the past several months about a job. I interviewed a few months ago and they said that they were impressed with some proof-of-concepts I put together and liked what they saw in my employment history. Nevertheless, there was someone more qualified for the position. I&#x27;ve stayed in contact with the technical manager and he suggested if I really wanted to work in security I should shoot for my CISSP. I kind of already knew this but was hesitant because I have no professional experience, and it requires 5 years minimum I believe.<p>Regardless of my lack of experience I&#x27;ve started to study, it looks like there&#x27;s a program for those who want to take the test but lack the required experience. I&#x27;ve been reading and coding for the past couple years on my own without anyone to interact with, I think if I could get this job I would learn a ton.<p>Sorry for the rant everyone. Sooner or later they are going to hire me, that&#x27;s what I tell myself, because I don&#x27;t intend on quitting.<p>Here are my questions:<p>- Do you have any advice on study strategies/tactics for the CISSP?\n- Any recommended reading related to computer science? (right now I&#x27;m picking away at Godel, Escher, and Bach; love it).\n- Other communities I would be wise to involve myself in?\n- Lastly, any professional and/or personal wisdom on building knowledge in infosec?<p>Thanks again everyone, this post isn&#x27;t very community-centric and I feel bad for that but I can&#x27;t think of anywhere else I would go for this sort of advice.",1405799920

If so,\nthen that option would likely be faster than my\ncurrent speed and cost me more which for now I would\nnot like.<p>Of course, maybe none of what I&#x27;ve just outlined is\nthe real issue, that is, maybe there is a <i>hidden\nagenda</i>.  So, maybe my ISP would work with, say,\nVimeo and give me good service when I was using\nVimeo but not work with YouTube or Netflix and from\nthem, then, give me poor service, largely\nindependent of what option I am buying from my ISP.\nSo, in effect, my ISP and Vimeo could have a\nmonopoly on video streaming to my computer and,\nthen, one way or another, be able to charge more,\nsay, from Vimeo to my ISP, or get higher revenue,\nsay, to Vimeo, as my access to Netflix and YouTube\nwere degraded.  Is something like that what is going\non?<p>If that&#x27;s what&#x27;s going on, then maybe what we should\nbe asking for is for all the <i>carriers</i>, and call\nthem <i>common carriers</i> to publish a list of\nspeed/service options with prices and, then, let\nanyone, at both ends, the user end and the server\nend, select their option, pay for it, and get it,\nwith no funny business.

But &quot;My clock is running behind&quot; means &quot;My clock is running slow,&quot; meaning it shows a time before the correct time.<p>Similarly, when projects are behind schedule (i.e. likely to complete after the correct time), we sometimes solve this by pushing the schedule back...

Those words are used to describe relative positioning of events, and in such use I think they have the opposite interpretation from what you suggested.<p>&quot;Event A occurred behind event B&quot;, for example, or &quot;A is behind schedule&quot; (although you could then argue that scheduling has its own semantics for &quot;behind&quot;).  However, even &quot;I&#x27;m running behind&quot; means running late, not early.<p>Even on a timeline, it&#x27;s not clear whether the point of perspective for determining &quot;in front of&quot; or &quot;behind&quot; is a point in the past or a point in the future.<p>Simple: use before and after, or earlier and later.<p>btw, the overall semantics of &quot;a means b, depending on whom you are speaking to&quot; made me cringe even though I know you meant &quot;A <i>usually</i> means B, but it depends...&quot; (which I don&#x27;t think is even true—see above—but that&#x27;s a factual not semantic complaint).

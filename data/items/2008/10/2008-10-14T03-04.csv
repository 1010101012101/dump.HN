Do this across generations, and you have societies taking over others. It is no coincidence that no one emulates the society of Soviet Russia but everyone across the world emulates the rich high-output western ones.",1223956082

Just turn on the juice, and you've got a 1000 hits of cocaine at 15 cents a KW/hour. I'm still pissed that Stern hung up on that guy, because he probably could have arranged an experiment.

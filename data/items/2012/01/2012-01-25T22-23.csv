Far more than any government in history ever has.  Far more than any charity every has or ever could.<p>Capitalism benefits people.  Every dollar in profit Apple puts in the bank is represented by thousands of dollars of improvement they've done to people's lives.<p>Capitalism is the cure to poverty-- when socialism is tried the countries quickly become hellholes.  When capitalism is allowed-- as it was in the US in the past-- the country went from 3rd world to 1st world in a couple generations.  India doubled the standard of living of over a billion people in 20 years simply by reducing red tape, allowing a little more capitalism.  China has done even better on that score.<p>Apple could burn all its money in a big old bonfire, and it still would have had a more positive impact on the world than Bill Gates charities ever will.  (In fact, I suspect Bill Gates charity work is actually making people's lives worse due to misallocation and undermining economies in those regions, combined with bad economics, but I haven't studied it closely enough to be sure.)",1327532290

We have to specify the process gets something done because it takes a hell of a lot of smarts to do this. Even things that seem very easy and straightforward to say out loud are filled with unknowns, assumptions and inconsistencies. Maybe all these ""programmers"" can stop whining about how programming is broken when we've created an AI that will understand what they want and just write the program for them. And as for constraint satisfaction programming - if you've ever actually programmed in prolog you'd realize that properly defining the problem such that you get a proper answer back is a hell of a lot of work. Prolog has it's place, but if it saved a huge amount of work and was easy to use people would be using it more often.",1327531911

I mean, what was it about Apple that caused religious zealots -- who are not Apple customers-- to seek out Apple customers and bash them?  Why feel so threatened that a company near bankruptcy dares to make something different?<p>Finally I came to understand why.  The reason is that deep down, you know Apple products are better.  IF you didn't' think that, why would you be threatened by people who think different?<p>Now that Apple is successful-- because its products are better-- the bashing has changed from ""Apple's nothing they have %2 market share!"" (When they actually had %25 market share in PCs) to ""Apple's evil! They want to control everything, they're worse than Microsoft!""  (which is kinda hilarious coming from google loving zealots-- google has betrayed people's trust, google is genuinely evil, while Apple has never cheated or lied to anyone that I'm aware of.)<p>And of course, because you're completely out of your mind irrational with hatred, you can't accept the fact that it is you who has a problem-- you who is seeking out peaceful apple customers minding their own business.<p>No, you must project your pathology onto them, and start calling them ""cultists"" and ""religious zealots"" and all manner of pejoratives like that.<p>Because, lying about Apple products, bashing Apple the company, spiting on Steve Jobs' grave-- these are not enough.  No, you must attack the people who dared to choose to be customers of Apple as well.<p>All those people you think are religious zealots-- if you look at what they say, and try real hard to be honest about it-- you'll recognize that all they're doing is correcting myths, misinformation and outright lies.

And it most probably can even work in court, to dodge possible antitrust inquires. Yet, it wasn't all that so good for Apple, and they removed some restrictions from their SDK to avoid some of these problems (it's slightly better now).

Many apps have been blocked from the iPhone apps store that were neither ""porn"" nor malware.<p>There have been a few mistakes, but I'm not aware of any apps that wouldn't fit into those categories.  I consider apps that trick users, or which use undocumented APIs to be malware.<p>Apps that are offensive, such as gay bashing apps, etc, have been blocked, this is true, though I put that under the ""porn"" label even though it isn't porn.  What's the broader word for ""apps that many people might find inappropriate or offensive""?<p>> could still allow side-loaded apps for those who wish to use them.<p>As I pointed out, Apple has gone out of their way to create a method for ""side loading"" apps.  They provided a way to create apps in javascript, which have access to much of the native hardware, you can install it thru the web, with a custom app icon and run them offline.<p>> Instead they block sideloaded apps to ensure complete control of the iOS ecosystem<p>On the contrary, as I mentioned there is a method to install apps completely out of Apple's control.

First, I want to say that I hope my first post did not sound like a personal attack on you.  I was only trying to present my view of the article that you linked to.  Next, I would like to try and back up the comments that I made about the article to hopefully make it a little more clear why I said that.<p>I referred to the article as opinion, hyperbole, and speculation, and here are some reasons why:  When I first opened the article, I noticed that the subtitle starts with ""Googles disastrous decision to muck up its search results..."", and then the first sentence of the article is ""Google just broke its search engine.""   Calling this ""disastrous"" is, in my opinion, both speculation and a big exaggeration.  I believe it's speculation because the SPYW option was released only two weeks ago, and it is clearly too early to tell if this will have any kind of a negative impact on Google or Google's users... let alone calling it a disaster (the exaggeration/hyperbole).  Google has clearly not broken its search engine (more hyperbole, in my opinion).  It works exactly the same as it did before, only with the additional option of being able to use SPYW.  I would like to emphasize that SPYW is an <i>option</i> that can be toggled on or off at the top of any search page.  It is easy to find these search settings/buttons on any search page, and if you would like more details please refer to [1] below.<p>Throughout the article, the author gives several made-up scenarios to illustrate what he believes to be critical flaws in Google's new SPYW option (although he ignores that it is in fact an <i>option</i>).  The author gives the example of doing a Google search for ""Facebook"".  I performed this search just now, and the number one result is Facebook.com, which is exactly what I would expect.  The next several results include the Wikipedia entry for Facebook, a link to Facebook's iPhone app, a link to Facebook's Twitter account, and other websites that provide more information and news about Facebook.  This is exactly what I would expect to see.  I see absolutely no problem with this.  The author tries to make it sound like he didn't see any of this, and that the only thing Google presented him with was a suggestion to add Mark Zuckerberg to one of his G+ circles, but this is simply not true.  Try this search for yourself right now and let me know what you see.  Go ahead and try it both with SPYW on or off (which can be toggled on/off on-the-fly with a single click at the top of the search page), and please let me know if you saw the same ""disaster"" that the author is talking about.<p>The author gives the example of searching for a plumber or information on how to fix a clogged toilet.  He then says ""What I dont want to know is which link my boss consulted when his toilet was clogged. I bet Im not alone.""  He doesn't want that (good, neither do I) and he doesn't have to ever see that in his results.  He is giving his opinion of what he thinks is going to happen, and what he predicts will be the downfall of Google as we know it.  Again, I am calling this opinion and speculation, because I have been trying all of these search queries that the author suggests, and I have not seen any of the problems he speaks of.  I can only come to the conclusion that his complaints are not real, but are just his opinion of what he thinks Google might become in the future for some reason (some kind of slippery-slope argument, fear-mongering mentality? I can't figure it out).<p>Later, he gives some links to use cases that Google employees have come up with for SPYW.  ""Yet even the examples that Google employees have been showing off dont seem very useful to me.""  They don't seem useful to him, but apparently they are useful to the person who came up with them....  That is the idea of having a ""personalized"" search option.  If he doesn't find that to be useful, he can turn it off, so he won't see things that are not useful to him.  In my opinion, this is a good thing.  Then he says ""If you dont follow Lee and you do the same search, you wont get that post.""  Again, that's the idea of the personalized search option.....  and again, it is an option that can be turned off if you don't think it's useful.<p>Please, explore your Google search settings and check out the new Google ""dashboard"".  You can fine tune exactly what comes up during ""personalized"" searches.  Or you can turn off SPYW permanently if you wish.  Also, if you hate it when Google tries to guess what you want, check out the ""Verbatim"" search option located under ""More search tools"" on the left side of any search page.  The ""Verbatim"" option makes Google do only what you tell it to do.  It won't even ask you ""Did you mean...."" anymore.<p>[1] Scroll down to the section heading ""Can I turn off personal results?"" here: <a href=""http://support.google.com/websearch/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=1710607"" rel=""nofollow"">http://support.google.com/websearch/bin/answer.py?hl=en&...</a>",1327530527

3512012,comment,3511531,3511895,1,0,gyardley,,,"I don't know anything about Virgin or Pixar, so I don't and won't explain them at all. For that matter, I don't know anything about the Mac, Lisa, and Apple II team. I have heard that Apple will create ten prototypes from scratch before picking one, but this seems a little different from having ten different <i>divisions</i> doing the exact same thing. I would be surprised if the ten different prototypes were made by ten different VPs, but there's a lot I don't know about Apple.<p>It matters a great deal if a division fails precisely because most companies only have one of them. If the company had two, certainly one could fail - but often companies don't have the resources for two. Splitting the division into two equal parts often isn't practical - sometimes it takes five people to complete a job and the company only has money for five salaries. And for most functional divisions - human resources, marketing, product management, finance, etc. - I really don't understand how the company <i>could</i> have two parallel organizations operating simultaneously, even if they had the resources, without causing damage to and confusion in the company.<p>I get that you'd like things to work differently - but I can only tell you how they work currently, at every company I've ever been a part of. If you can persuade a company to hire you as the vice president of something without lengthy experience, that's terrific, and I wish you much success.

3512011,comment,3510758,3510758,32,0,jrockway,,,"The problem is that the author simply didn't notice the refactoring and abstraction opportunities available.  (One question to ask yourself: ""How do I test this?""  If you can't answer that question, the code is wrong.)<p>We'll start with the synchronous example:<p><pre><code>    myThing = synchronousCache.get(""id:3244"");
    if (myThing == null) {
      myThing = synchronousDB.query(""SELECT * from something WHERE id = 3244"");
    }
</code></pre>
This is verbose and tedious.  We should really make the API look like:<p><pre><code>    myThing = database.lookup({'id':3244}, {'cache':cache_object});
</code></pre>
Let's apply this idea to his asynchronous example.  We want the code to look like:<p><pre><code>    database.lookup({'id':3244}, {'cache':cache_object}, function(myThing) {
        // whatever
    });
</code></pre>
So instead of writing this:<p><pre><code>    asynchronousCache.get(""id:3244"", function(err, myThing) {
      if (myThing == null) {
        asynchronousDB.query(""SELECT * from something WHERE id = 3244"", function(err, myThing) {
          // We now have a thing from DB, do something with result
          // ...
        });
    
      } else {
        // We have a thing from cache, do something with result
        // ...
      }
    });
</code></pre>
We need to refactor this.  Remember, node.js is a continuation-passing-style language.  So let's set a convention and say that every function takes two continuations (success and error).<p>Then, to compose two functions of one argument:<p><pre><code>   function f(x, result, error)
   function g(x, result, error)
</code></pre>
To:<p><pre><code>   h = f o g
</code></pre>
You write:<p><pre><code>   function compose(f, g){
       return function(x, result, error){
           g(x, function(x_){ f(x_, result, error) }, error);
       }
   }
</code></pre>
(Data flows right-to-left over composition, so ""do x, then do y"" is written: ""do y"" o ""do x"".)<p>Now we can cleanly write a complex program from simple parts.  We'll start by creating a result type:<p><pre><code>    result = { 'id': null, 'value': null, 'not_found': null }
</code></pre>
Then, we'll implement cache functions that take keys (as results of this type) and return values (as results of this type).  Looking up an entry in cache looks like:<p><pre><code>    cache.lookup = function(key, result, error){
        new_key = key.copy();
        cache.raw_cache.lookup(key.id, function(value){
            new_key.result = value;
            new_key.not_found = false;
            result(new_key)
        },
        function(error_type, error_msg){
            if(error_type == ENOENT){
                new_key.not_found = true;
                result(new_key)
            }
            else {
                error(error_type, error_msg);
            }
        });
    };
</code></pre>
Looking up an entry in the database looks about the same.  The key feature is that the ""return value"" and the ""input"" are of the same type.  That makes composing, in the case of ""try various abstract storage layer lookups in a fixed order"", very easy.  (Yes, the example is contrived.)<p><pre><code>    dbapi.lookup = function(key, result, error){ ... };
 </code></pre>
Now we can very easily implement the logic, ""look up a value in the cache, if it's not there, look it up in the database"":<p><pre><code>    cached_lookup = compose(dbapi.lookup, cache.lookup);
    cached_lookup(1234, do_next_step, handle_error);
</code></pre>
You can, of course, generalize compose to something like:<p><pre><code>    my_program = do([cache.lookup, dbapi.lookup, print_result]);
</code></pre>
Writing clean and maintainable code in node.js is the same as writing it in any other language.  You need to design your program correctly, and rewrite the parts that aren't designed correctly when you realize that your code is becoming messy.<p>Continuation-passing style is pretty weird, but you do get some benefits over the alternatives.  Writing a program with coroutines involves deferring to the scheduler coroutine every so often, littering your code with meaningless lines like ""yield();"".  Using ""real"" threads is even worse; your code looks like single-threaded code, but different parts of your program are running concurrently.  (Did you share any non-thread-safe data structures, like Java's date formatter?  Hope not, because you won't know you did until the production code dies at 3am.)  Continuation-passing style lets you ""pretend"" that you are executing multiple threads concurrently, but the structure of the code ensures that only one codepath is running at a time.  This means that libraries that don't do IO don't have to be thread safe, since only one ""thread"" runs at a time.<p>All concurrency models involve trade-offs over other concurrency models.  But when comparing them, make sure you're comparing the actual trade-offs, not your programming ability with each model.",1327530181

3511962,comment,3510109,3511595,4,0,mdwrigh2,,,"> Example 1: Search for cars while ""opted"" out of G+ results. Ferarri's G+ page is on top on the right, but no link to Ferrari's actual website or their FB page. So if this was focused on relevancy wouldn't the Ferrari link be to Ferrari's home page? Not that I think Ferrari is the most relevant result period, but wouldn't that make sense? Not only that, in your main results Ferrari.com isn't listed in the top 100. So how could they be relevant? This gives pageviews to G+ where the user should be going elsewhere. This isn't just about Twitter/Facebook. Google is driving users to its content over other publishers. This is an ADVERTISEMENT for Google+. 100% Which is against your policies not to mark them clearly as ads. <a href=""http://www.google.com/competition/howgoogleadswork.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/competition/howgoogleadswork.html</a><p>I think it's pretty clearly marked what it is, right above it it says ""People and Pages on Google+"". Is it mixed in with the search results? Is it taking the place of search results? No, its not doing either. I don't think you can really complain that it violates the ""Strict Separation of Ads and Search Results"".<p>> Example 2: I searched for NFC Championship Game in Google while being opted in. I got a status update from MG Siegler stating he was going to the game in the top 5 results. MG Siegler is not in my circles. Wouldn't an article on the game be 100X better than this result. So you are driving users to your irrelevant content in replace of ESPN. That makes no sense.<p>Yes, it would be better in this case. But what if the game was going on and someone posted about something that had <i>just happened</i>? Wouldn't that be potentially more relevant? Figuring out relevancy is difficult. As of now, I don't see MG Siegler's post in my SPYW results, so I'm guessing it showing up for you had to do with the timeliness of the post.<p>> Example 4: You can't opt out 100%. That is disingenuous to say you can.<p>Can you be more specific as to what you can't opt out of?<p>> Example 5: Google was supposed to be ""Do No Evil"" and you have squashed that. It is worse to be screwed by someone who claims to be trustworthy than someone you know is not. For example, we all knew Microsoft was shady from the beginning so we didn't expect much. But you guys said it was all about relevancy, the user, do no evil, etc. Look at this way, if a girl married Gene Simmons could she honestly be pissed if he was cheating on her? But if a girl married a guy like Donnie Osmond and he cheated she would be devastated. She was probably only with him in the first place because he was trustworthy. You are Donnie Osmond. :)<p>Regarding ""Do No Evil"": <a href=""https://plus.google.com/109412257237874861202/posts/4U2mpZ6hazU"" rel=""nofollow"">https://plus.google.com/109412257237874861202/posts/4U2mpZ6h...</a>",1327529117

Let's go through that list and try to figure out how to make things better:<p>> Stable, versioned releases, with sufficient API (if not ABI) compatibility across releases.<p>When people do this on GitHub, the usual method is to create a release tag for each
version. GitHub offers tarballs of the repo at each version tag, and can quickly switch
views of the code.<p>I try to always use proper semantic versioning once my software reaches maturity, and I've never noticed GitHub getting in
the way of that.<p>> Accurate and complete API documentation (with bonus points for higher-level integration documentation.<p>There are a variety of Right Ways to do this, and it varies by language. In Haskell, for
example, the most popular form of API documentation is automatically generated from the
code and specially-formatted comments by Haddock. For other languages, there are various
competing ways of doing API docs, from writing the stuff manually up through a number of
doc extraction tools.<p>I think the ideal way for GitHub to handle this would be to introduce a separate docs
repo for each project, serve up the generated HTML, and put out some tools for updating
it. This is similar to what they do with project wikis.<p>This would require the cooperation of external tools to be easy, but the GitHub guys have
enough fame that they could probably start a flood of tools if they just get it started.<p>> A bug tracking system<p>GitHub has a rudimentary form of this, but it would be nice if they could insert
prominent links to external bug trackers, so people could use their favorite one. Barring
that, sticking a clearly-labeled link in the top-level readme file is a decent
approximation.<p>> Mailing lists.<p>Google Groups is a decent approximation of this. Again, it would be nice if there were a
standard way to insert links to external mailing list pages in GitHub projects.<p>Any more problems or solutions?",1327529112

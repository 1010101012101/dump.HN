Closed allocation dooms you to prevailing mediocrity and process can only make that worse.<p>Most management and process exists to turn 1.0x developers into 1.2x (in theory) but turns the 10x into 3x or 2x or sometimes -2x. When you start enforcing process, closing up definitions of work, and take power away from engineers, you lose so much more off the top than you get from bringing up the bottom.<p>The problem is that very few executives <i>actually</i> want to create an inspiring place to work where people do their best.

Having been spoiled by Visual Studio, I now lack the patience necessary to setup a dev environment from scratch with Emacs or Vi or whatever.<p>And no, Eclipse is not an alternative, though <i>maybe</i> NetBeans is, which are two statements I really wouldn&#x27;t have said 10 years ago. I don&#x27;t really feel like it&#x27;s a case of Visual Studio having gotten significantly better. NetBeans has gotten significantly better and Eclipse has gotten significantly worse. MonoDevelop and Xamarin Studio are waaaaay too buggy to be useful. I find myself gravitating to a text editor like Geany or really anything that combines syntax highlighting, tabbed documents, and a file explorer. It&#x27;s amazing how infrequently those three things come together (I&#x27;m looking at you, Notepad++ and Notepad2), or just don&#x27;t work very well (Hi there, LightTable and DrRacket).<p>While I like C#, the promise of quality cross-platform software with it is mostly a boondoggle. The hoops you have to jump through, and the state of the dev tools for Mono, just push me towards Java anytime I need a cross-platform desktop GUI app.<p>And that&#x27;s sad. Because it&#x27;s not like Java does a particularly good job of it, it just does a site-better job of it than most anything else. I don&#x27;t have a good enough handle on the C toolchain to pick up and run with Qt or GTK and cross compile for every platform. And nobody pays enough attention to desktop in basically any other language.<p>Please, correct me if I&#x27;m wrong, because I&#x27;d really, really like to be wrong here. I suppose I could do [Pythong|Ruby|OCaml|Haskell|Racket]+[GTK|Qt], but it feels grating. It doesn&#x27;t match. As far as I can tell, there is no GUI library that works well in functional languages--even a wrapper on top of an OO one. But again, correct me if I&#x27;m wrong. Please.<p>Other than that, I wish I had ditched SQL Server a long time ago. Postgres is just as easy to install and use now, and has been for several years. I wish I had the balls to replace my clients servers with Postgres and just not tell them about it. They probably wouldn&#x27;t notice.<p>I wish I had never wasted time on Python.<p>I wish I had kept gaming to my Playstation and stuck it through with Linux back in 2000.<p>I wish I had not gone to college. Going to college meant I had to get a job that paid well to service my debt afterwards. And for where I lived, that meant I had to buy a car. Even still, being 22 years old and having only $35k in debt was far better off than most of my peers, and even better still than most of the kids graduating today, so I guess I&#x27;m not too badly off. But still, I think about  the last 10 years and really wish I had been writing all of that software for myself rather than The Man.<p>What the hell was the point of writing all those projects in college for the command line? 4 years of wasted practice on an interface only other programmers care about. It is such a fundamentally different paradigm, and most of my peers didn&#x27;t transition well. <i>I</i> didn&#x27;t transition well, and I&#x27;ve been either the most successful person or at least in the top 3 of my graduating class.<p>I wish I had never stopped doing screwy shit in JavaScript. There was stuff I wrote in 1997 that people are pushing today as &quot;the power of HTML 5!&quot; If I stuck with it, instead of listening to my &quot;betters&quot; at work or in college, then I think I could have contributed a lot more.<p>So, less about what specifically I would have studied, and more about not listening to what others have to say about what I should have been doing.",1392047864

7211649,comment,7210700,7210700,1,0,8bithero,,,"I think the best approach is to build something practical like a web app. Granted, things may still feel like magic when you&#x27;re done with the tutorials, but the mist slowly clears the more you practice and every other day you&#x27;ll be having &quot;AHA!&quot; moments.\nFrom what you&#x27;ve mention it does sound like JavaScript is what you&#x27;re looking for. You probably don&#x27;t need to learn an entire framework like AngularJS if you don&#x27;t care about writing entire apps and only care about adding &#x27;flourishes&#x27; to your designs. However, I need to agree @lmm, when starting out it really is the superficial things that matter. Personally I found JavaScript to be a bit tedious at first. Not to mention some hidden surprises you may run into (i.e. how scopes bubble, etc.) - so if your intention is to write full apps, I don&#x27;t know if JS should be your first choice (but it should definitely be your second!).<p>In the case where you want to learn all aspects of building web-apps (and don&#x27;t come from a computer science background), I would have to suggest you start out buy learning a framework like Ruby on Rails or Django (haven&#x27;t tried flask, so can&#x27;t tell). The reason I&#x27;d suggest one of these MVC frameworks is that you will learn a lot about the REST architecture (REST is the fundamentals of the modern web, you will probably be consuming REST services with JS frameworks). At least with rails it taught me the fundamentals, without even realising it. After figuring out how rails handled resources looking at APIs etc, all made sense. So for this reason I&#x27;d recommend people who don&#x27;t have a CS background to learn from one of these frameworks - it really helped me fill in a lot of missing pieces when it comes to developing for the web. As for the language, I&#x27;ve tried both Ruby and Python, and found Ruby to be a bit more fun to write. It made programming seem like solving a puzzle rather than figuring out obscure syntax (which was the case for more &#x27;hard core&#x27; languages like C++). Not to mention the fact that it seems to be the language of least surprises - more often than not, it does exactly what you expect it to do.<p>Sorry if I went on a bit of a tangent. Wrote this in a hurry. Hope it helps.",1392047551

Maybe it has the right price at the moment and is fine by you, but as it&#x27;s less liquid, it&#x27;s less certain to hold its value over the longer period of time.",1392047533

I am not convinced that the remainder has to be &quot;discrimination&quot;. Perhaps they just haven&#x27;t thought of every possible factor?<p>Take women in IT - how many samples did they even find for female programmers? I am highly skeptic about most studies really comparing men and women doing exactly the same job.<p>I have tried to get data for such studies to check, but it tends to be not available.<p>&quot;Of course that is absurd. My mother is a feminist.&quot;<p>I never said that no feminists are mothers. Besides I think a lot of feminists don&#x27;t really understand what they are even fighting for. If you define feminism as &quot;equality for men and women&quot;, most people would probably say they are feminists.<p>Did your mother take time off to spend with you then?<p>&quot;The whole point of feminism is everyone has a choice to do what they want.&quot;<p>At face value - but they seem to have a hard time accepting that people want different things, and that perhaps women WANT to stay home more often than men. Or rather, as I suspect, are given the opportunity more often.<p>If you want real equality and you measure that aspect, you would have to force women to go back to work as quickly as possible after child birth, so that the fathers can have their turn at staying at home.<p>Of course feminists think staying at home with children is a horrible ordeal, but I think if they finally get their wish they might regret it once they have children.<p>In France where this might have started (with Simone de Beauvoir) there is now a counter movement of mothers who don&#x27;t want to give their kid to childcare at age 3 months anymore. And afaik Beauvoir didn&#x27;t demand women should go to work because it would free them, but because she saw the time with children as too easy and tempting to slack off. She wanted to force women to be tough.<p>&quot;They want men to have the same opportunities to spend time with their children as women and the same opportunities to work as women without societal pressure.&quot;<p>It doesn&#x27;t sound like that in most publications, though. The idea seems rather that spending time with children is horrible and men should shoulder their equal half of the burden instead of having fun at work.<p>If you read so many studies, you probably also read that childless women actually tend to earn more than men. So not being respected is not really the issue.<p>Children ARE the main issue. It is a problem that employers have to worry about female employees dropping out, and therefore the value of a female employee might be lessened. Not only that - thinking about the costs of education, I wonder if it is also less likely to pay off for a woman if she has to take a few years off that could otherwise be used to earn back the money spent on education.<p>That is a real issue I accept. The solution seems less clear. Feminism seems to assume that women simply want the same things as men. But what if they really want to spend time with their kids? I don&#x27;t think it is unfair to let there be a cost to that.<p>It&#x27;s a problem for women who don&#x27;t want kids, but what would be a good solution?<p>&quot;It is simply the belief that men and women should be treated as equals.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s not, unfortunately. It is the idea that women are victims and should get special treatment because of that. But I grant you that many feminists probably believe your version. The irony is that most feminists demands really hurt women. For example now they fight for childcare everywhere. In result there will be no excuse to stay at home with children, and both father and mother will earn less (because of more people in the workforce) and be unable to afford to leave one parent at home.

As the complexity of a system grows, the number of things it does under the hood grows. At some point I can&#x27;t keep track of what&#x27;s going on, and I no longer have confidence in my knowledge of the system, without setting aside time for a code review.\n> With pid 1 being incredibly simple, and the executables it runs being incredibly simple, I know what&#x27;s going on, I know what the possible problems are and I know how to fix them. The more complex it is, the more difficult it is for me to know what&#x27;s going on. That&#x27;s all it comes down to for me.<p>How is, say, sysv init better in this regard? Instead of having declarative service files that say <i>what</i> should be done, you have a collection of disparate shell scripts, all with their own implementations of basically the same things. The complexity isn&#x27;t reduced, it&#x27;s spread around (and IMO it&#x27;s more complicated).<p>If you want to have control over your system, wouldn&#x27;t you want to use an init system that can actually keep track of all of the child processes of a service? Brittle hacks like pidfiles cannot ensure management over all child processes of a service -- this is only possible with cgroups.<p>> As an aside: A lot of systemd is API-driven, meaning if you want a feature you have to build it into the system as new code. This means you have to be a C developer to leverage some new feature, instead of writing an interpreted script and interacting with it via pipes/plugins/etc. If your current system is dependent on some feature that doesn&#x27;t yet exist in systemd, you now have to build it in, instead of using what worked with sysvinit before.<p>No, you just use D-Bus, from whatever your favorite language is, using that language&#x27;s D-Bus bindings. Systemd has a stable D-Bus API for this purpose that&#x27;s guaranteed to work in the future.<p>> Not only is systemd broken by design, it&#x27;s still in its infancy, and does not support the same features that have been built into other systems for years.<p>Out of curiosity, what features are you referring to specifically?<p>> This additional load of development for many orgs serves no purpose, and is essentially ignored by the leadership that decide to change init systems by fiat.<p>This would be more convincing if it were just Lennart & co. making the decisions, but in the absence of evidence to the contrary, I&#x27;m going to go out on a limb and assume that the technical leadership of Fedora, RHEL, OpenSUSE, Arch, and now Debian do not all make decisions by fiat for no reason.",1392046346

That is, a huge sell order on Bitstamp will more or less immediately affect the price on BTC-E, MtGox, etc.  (The exception seems to be Coinbase, which seems to use some kind of exponential weighted averaging, but even Coinbase will get dragged down if the price drop is dramatic enough.)<p>If people lose all confidence in Gox, but still retain faith in other exchanges, then that means we&#x27;re going to witness MtGox&#x27;s price drop while the other exchanges&#x27; prices rise.  However, this becomes an economic opportunity for anyone who wants to do arbitrage between exchanges.  Therefore it seems like the prices won&#x27;t ever diverge too much.<p>The conclusion, it seems, is that no matter how bad one exchange is, it will simply drag the overall price of Bitcoin down across all exchanges rather than suffer punishment as an individual company.  The fact that arbitrage is doable seems to give MtGox some insulation from consumer outrage.<p>This poses a question:  Is it true that as long as an exchange keeps functioning, then it&#x27;s &quot;here to stay&quot; no matter how badly they behave?

To do that I need to be sure of what it is doing and how. As the complexity of a system grows, the number of things it does under the hood grows. At some point I can&#x27;t keep track of what&#x27;s going on, and I no longer have confidence in my knowledge of the system, without setting aside time for a code review.<p>With pid 1 being incredibly simple, and the executables it runs being incredibly simple, I know what&#x27;s going on, I know what the possible problems are and I know how to fix them. The more complex it is, the more difficult it is for me to know what&#x27;s going on. That&#x27;s all it comes down to for me.<p>As an aside: A lot of systemd is API-driven, meaning if you want a feature you have to build it into the system as new code. This means you have to be a C developer to leverage some new feature, instead of writing an interpreted script and interacting with it via pipes/plugins/etc. If your current system is dependent on some feature that doesn&#x27;t yet exist in systemd, you now have to build it in, instead of using what worked with sysvinit before.<p>Not only is systemd broken by design, it&#x27;s still in its infancy, and does not support the same features that have been built into other systems for years. This additional load of development for many orgs serves no purpose, and is essentially ignored by the leadership that decide to change init systems by fiat.",1392045133

This is different topic than the strong law of small numbers, or survivorship bias aka the backbone of our financial system.<p>This brings up an interesting meta discussion of medal inflation.  A simple wikipedia lookup and division shows 15K medals / 50 games is about 300 medals per game, but inflation has happened over the years so I think we&#x27;ll have well over 300 medals this season.<p>This waters down the marketing message.  There are 300 recent medal winning olympians, lets say they have a decade of marketing relevance, thats five sets of games, or 1500 medal winners.  The entire NFL only has 1500 or so players, in comparison.  I believe this waters down the usefulness of the olympics.  If all the olympics had was the decathlon, that would mean something more than it currently means.<p>This is aside from the meta issue that&#x27;s its basically a marketing and advertising trade show where as a side event some athletes perform.  So the primary, important numbers are the dollar value of advertisements sold, sponsorships purchased, not some athletic achievement which was just a screensaver for the financial spreadsheet.",1392044699

They want men to have the same opportunities to spend time with their children as women and the same opportunities to work as women without societal pressure. It&#x27;s all up to the choices each individual and family wants to make for themselves. But if a women chooses to do labor in the job market she should be treated as an equal to men. That&#x27;s all these feminist are saying. if she chooses not to have children, then she should also be respected.<p>People like to think of feminism as something that&#x27;s a scary monster or something.

It sucks for lots of things. It is not that Google has not tried, as it is in their best interest to do so.&quot;</i><p>Google hasn&#x27;t tried deep integration of web apps with Android. Their competing Chrome OS does and Chromebooks are a bestseller in 2013. Mobile Chrome doesn&#x27;t have &quot;apps&quot; or plugins, like Firefox does, which is kind of disappointing. &quot;Add to Homescreen&quot; of favorite links was added in version 31 and current stable version is 32, so that&#x27;s one version ago.<p>The reasons for this state of affairs can only be guessed, but given that you probably don&#x27;t work for Google and you don&#x27;t claim to have insider knowledge, I guess that quoted phrase is just pure speculation - and a much more sensible guess would be that delivering a native SDK that works well was faster than trying to push for new web standards (since Android was competing with iOS and second to market) ... something which they are doing with Chrome OS and Mozilla is doing with Firefox OS and it&#x27;s a very different reason than your claim.<p>And if I am to make a prediction, I bet that in the future either we&#x27;ll see Android and Chrome OS merging, or we&#x27;ll see Chrome OS mobile devices, in addition to Android.<p>> &quot;<i>Consumers probably don&#x27;t like having to be connected all day, all what they do in their computers being monitored in real time and stored forever by the NSA.&quot;</i><p>Web interfaces and offline access are not mutually exclusive.

And we would need new web standards for extensions and probably for doing client-side encryption, however these are not insurmountable problems.

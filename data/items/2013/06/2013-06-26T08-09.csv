It is argued that the idea of progress as a goal for humanity is pointless, because we are ultimately restricted by our nature, and instead of idealizing the concept of progress we should be satisfied with what we are.<p>However, it is painfully obvious that we are not imprisoned by our nature. We were not born to fly, yet we do fly. We fly gigantic metal heaps, around the world and even farther. We carry oxygen with us to outer space to circumvent our biological limitations. We can already bypass certain built-in elements of our &quot;nature&quot;, such as anger, via medicine or surgery. In fact, we have been capable of changing our nature for a long time already, as advances in science have taught us that it is possible to cause physical changes in our brains through conscious effort, such as meditation. In the future, our capabilities for changing our nature will only increase.<p>Yes, we are still commonly quite foolish, and history has shown that we easily reduce ourselves to beasts in times of crisis, but we can, and have changed our beliefs into ones that represent the world around us more accurately. Using labels like secular humanism, our progress may be painted to look like misdirected religion, but these ideologies do not just represent the idea of progress, they have proven it - we truly have developed a more accurate image of our existence.

I believe the best practice among public attacks is to do that.  There are probably various exploits in iOS itself which let you root phones remotely.  Beyond that, either secret attacks or hardware attacks, or figuring out how to get the phone to boot from one ramdisk while talking to the security element from before (which is trivial if you can sign stuff as Apple, and may actually be possible otherwise.)",1372236103

Everything got much better with the 4S/iPad 2 and later.  So, if you can get the phone to boot from your replacement image, you should be able to run arbitrary attacks against the encrypted image.  This would be complex.  Much much easier for Apple, and still doesn&#x27;t really count as a &quot;backdoor&quot; in the hardware key storage itself.  If you could bypass the 10 tries lockout again, you can do ~12 tries/second, so 20 minutes to defeat a simple 4-digit passcode.<p>I suspect someone could decap the chip itself and extract the key, at the cost of the phone (and burning a bunch of whatever chip they&#x27;re using in advance to prep for the attack).  That probably would be worthwhile for a conference presentation.  I&#x27;m confident any decent intelligence service which doesn&#x27;t have Apple&#x27;s cooperation can do this now, since extracting keys from hardware is a pretty key capability for anyone doing black bag stuff.

5944793,comment,5944190,5944647,6,0,dalke,,,"There are two types of millimeter scanners: passive and active. The first only uses background sources, which is possible since things emit millimeter wavelengths naturally. This can have no additional physical effect on people. However, like passive infrared imaging, these can have poor sensitivity and low contrast. This is why people prefer to have a millimeter light source. (You see the same with infrared imaging. Passive IR uses natural heat sources, while active IR uses an infrared illumination source. For that matter, you see the same with visible light: the flash on a camera is an illumination source.)<p>Active millimeter scanners use a source of millimeter waves. It&#x27;s easy to figure out how much energy is in a mm wavelength photon: E = h * c/ where h is Plack&#x27;s constant, c is the speed of light, and  is the wavelength. That&#x27;s <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=planck&#x27;s+constant+*+speed+of+light+%2F+(1+mm)+in+eV"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/search?q=planck&#x27;s+constant+*+speed+of...</a>  = 0.001 eV.<p>By comparison, a photon needs over 3 eV to break a chemical bond, which requires a wavelength in the ultraviolet range or lower. (This is worked out <a href=""http://www.kwantlen.ca/science/physics/faculty/mcoombes/P1220_Solutions/ModernPhysics/P1220_05_Solutions.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kwantlen.ca/science/physics/faculty/mcoombes/P122...</a> ). There&#x27;s not enough energy in a mm wavelength photon to cause a direct chemical change.<p>I say &quot;direct&quot; because there are indirect possibilities that aren&#x27;t relevant to this discussion. For example, you could use infrared radiation to heat something up and burn it. This happens because the energy in the photon is absorbed by the target, which can&#x27;t be cooled off fast enough, so it gets hot. Or you could use microwave radiation in a microwave oven to do the same, even though there too the photon alone isn&#x27;t enough to affect the bonds.<p>BTW, the term &quot;radiation&quot; is used for regular light, infrared, ultraviolet, radio waves, microwaves, and gamma rays. A camera&#x27;s flash is, in physics terms, a radiation source. As the wavelengths get smaller (eg, UV light), there is enough energy in a single photon to affect a chemical bond and cause it to split. This is why UV radiation exposure is a possible source for cancer, and why UV-B&#x27;s shorter wavelengths are more dangerous than UV-A.<p>At even smaller wavelengths (eg, X-rays), then there&#x27;s enough energy in a single photon to force an electron off of an atom. The atom then has a positive charge, so it&#x27;s called an ion. Ionized molecules are very reactive, and more likely to lead to chemical damage. Radiation with this level of energy is called &quot;ionizing radiation.&quot;<p>The confusing part is that people commonly use the term &quot;radiation&quot; to mean specifically &quot;ionizing radiation&quot;, even though it can apply to things like a heat source. (Ie, the home radiator is an IR radiation source.)",1372235244

5944745,comment,5944207,5944207,26,0,aidos,,,"This is an interesting discussion. I&#x27;m deep into a project now (as the sole developer) where I was surprised to learn that the frontend js is about 30% bigger than the backend (python).<p>In ipython I use autoreload (thanks to a tip on HN) so that the code in the objects in memory is kept in sync with my editor. My workflow is: load up a bunch of objects I&#x27;m working on, try to get the expected output, fail, change code in my editor again, check the the output, repeat. Within ipython you can even &#x27;%ed obj.broken_function&#x27; to edit it directly in vim. There&#x27;s no doubt that the auto reload discovery improved my efficiency. Aside from the time it saves, I&#x27;m able to think of my running code and on disk code as the same thing. Don&#x27;t underestimate how powerful that is.<p>But as I said, my code is now mostly frontend code. After over 15 years in web development the reload cycle has become second nature to me. It&#x27;s silly though. I have a lot of state to maintain in the js and every reload is expensive. In my specific case I could be looking at 2 minutes to even load the objects from the web server.<p>I&#x27;m going to have a look at the chrome options to see what&#x27;s available in terms of hot code swapping. I disagree that it&#x27;s important for all browsers to support it. Even just finding a good solution in the browser I do most development in (chrome, presently) would be a major win.",1372234012
5944744,comment,5942757,5944492,1,0,Houshalter,,,"What I meant by that dividing the population has a cost. Only one evolutionary path is going to end up with the best solution. By best I mean the best one you find, not necessarily the most optimal solution possible, which may never be found.<p>If you divide the population in two, at least half of your resources are wasted on doing tests and evolving traits which will just be discarded. Resources which could have been used to speed up the evolution of the other population. Even if the evolutionary path you choose isn&#x27;t the optimal one, by putting twice as much resources too it, it still might end up further. And if you divide it into more than 2 species than it&#x27;s just getting insane.<p>That&#x27;s not to say that speciation isn&#x27;t a useful heuristic, just that it&#x27;s a costly one. However there are a lot of cases where just throwing more resources at the problem doesn&#x27;t help, because it&#x27;s stuck in a local maxima. In that case, going back to an earlier point in the simulation and running it to see if it ends up somewhere else isn&#x27;t a bad idea, and that&#x27;s exactly the same as what speciation is (except that you are doing it after the fact, rather than testing both evolutionary paths simultaneously.)",1372233954

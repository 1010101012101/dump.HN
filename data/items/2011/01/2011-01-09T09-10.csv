3.

2085205,comment,2082537,2082537,0,0,pknight,,,"I work a little different than most, as in I don't plan a set schedule in advance or according to a fixed routine. I look to reduce low-efficient workflow and seek to maximize optimal workflow taking intuitive, up to date cues from how I'm feeling & doing. Examples:<p>My approach involves compartmentalizing blocks of time through out the day and devoting blocks to separate projects. When I'm working on one project I don't worry about other projects because they have their own blocks. It helps to avoid nagging thoughts that are related to other projects/commitments while one is trying to tend to another.
Those nagging thoughts are a major point of stress/distraction/lack of productivity so I make it a point to prevent and counteract them. Each dedicated block is like giving permission to tend to one area and one area only. This works as long as I am concrete/clear about it.<p>In between blocks I take advantage of mental reboots/refreshers by resting, exercising, eating, socializing etc. Nothing original about that, but it works. Especially if you stop working when you hit a roadblock, or find you're getting tired, switching to rest or to a different project helps is most likely much more efficient than struggling along. If I'm frustrated I know I'm not working optimally and that's a cue to either switch to resting or a different project.<p>I give way to flow, or being in a zone, because it's like to be the most rapid and effective way to get things realized. Whatever is psychologically easy/pleasant to do is probably going to be more effective use of time. Note that that has nothing to do with intellectual difficulty (working on a really hard problem can be fun etc). Of course this doesn't work all day everyday and for everything, but as a general guideline it makes a big difference - at least for me.<p>It's a bit like sailing, I know generally where I want to head, but I work with the wind and weather. It works nice if you have a lot of flexibility and freedom about how you manage your time.",1294564398
2085204,comment,2082505,2085103,0,0,quadhome,,,"There are two cases that we're addressing:<p>1. A developer writes an end-user application, but doesn't want to free their software. Clearly, this person isn't going to use GPL libraries.<p>2. A developer modifies an end-user application licensed under the GPL. If a developer makes a modification and then <i>distributes</i> that modification, then clearly it was of use to someone outside of that developer.

2085200,comment,2084157,2085058,0,0,mambodog,,,"Way more dynamic objects (vehicles, destructible environments) with a much larger playable area (more room for more objects). Usually objects further from the player are updated less frequently (to deal with the sheer volume of objects) but may still be visible to the player, client-side prediction comes in handy here.<p>Also the need for more detailed positional/vector data for much more complex physics simulation, which also requires both a higher resolution of updates to function realistically. Additionally, fast moving vehicles with more delicate control/handling, such as fighter aircraft, also a require higher resolution of updates so that you can actually fly them without crashing due to the feedback loop of perceiving jerky/delayed movement and input response. Prediction can help to smooth this out.<p>Additionally modern games use things like physically simulated projectiles (think bullet drop[1]) with collisions calculated using mesh-based collisions instead of simple hitboxes, over much longer distances, so there is a need for prediction as timing is more of a factor. Quake 1, 2 and 3[2] use the 'hitscan' method[3] of calculating whether a bullet hits its target, which is instant and calculates a linear trajectory, which has the side effect of making it easier for players to adjust to lag (basically any difference between the player firing and the hit registering is network lag, and should be more or less consistent).<p>Finally, two slightly different issues that have become apparent in recent years are automatic match-making and local servers (ie, the game running on one player's console). Auto matchmaking is often fairly shitty, meaning that (on average) players end up playing on servers to which they have a higher ping time than if they had chosen the server from a server browser (something that is sadly becoming rare in today's games). The phenomena of local servers, on the other hand, puts pressure on the total available throughput, rather than ping time, as the player that is hosting likely has more limited outgoing bandwidth than a dedicated server might.<p>[1]<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_ballistics#Bullet_drop"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_ballistics#Bullet_drop</a><p>[2] only for some weapons, a rare exception for the time<p>[3]<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitscan"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitscan</a>",1294564132

Operating a business and effectively allocating capital are two very different skills, but smart operators seem to believe their intelligence carries over to capital allocation.<p>The fact is that most companies destroy shareholder value when they buy other companies. A recent example is the whole yahoo/delicious debacle but anyone reading this can think of a handful of other equally terrible examples off the top of their head. A far more difficult exercise would be to name the acquisitions that actually added long-term value. For example, Apple is generally great at only buying companies that add real value.

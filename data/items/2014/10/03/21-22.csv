Startups can&#x27;t really compete with that. However, at a startup 1) people tend to learn a lot more and learn it faster, 2) people are closer on a personal level, 3) people usually have a lot more impact, 4) there&#x27;s much less bureaucracy, etc.<p>At this point, if I really needed money, I&#x27;d try to go back to Google, but if $120k was sufficient -- and it&#x27;s more than sufficient for most people -- I&#x27;d prefer to work at a startup. Even if the equity is worth nothing, it can be a wonderful experience.",1412373586

Ordering online is nothing new and tons of people order posters online, but people don&#x27;t frame online because it&#x27;s time-consuming work that takes practice and a lot can go wrong. You would be surprised how many people have a lot of difficulty using a ruler! Even professional framers. Which leads to returns & recuts for this website. Did the customer drop the frame, did the moulding warp from humidity? How do you know?<p>If you brought me a poster and you&#x27;re not telling me you&#x27;re on a budget, I&#x27;d work with you to choose frames for you and the art and depending on your level of involvement, I&#x27;d pick colors that we both agree look awesome. Often cost is the last thing discussed. Some stores, maybe you&#x27;re spending more time to dial back a design to save money. It&#x27;s like selling anything, what seems like a lot to me is affordable to somebody else. There are ways to save money but that&#x27;s a long tangent.<p>Cost mostly depends on the scale, the quality of glass and your taste. Some frames are just expensive because of the labor involved, the country it&#x27;s from, etc. You can also go crazy with fabric mats, stacking fillets, raising/floating elements and on and on. For prints 20&quot; wide (just reading your website) that&#x27;s going to be more affordable because you&#x27;re using smaller sheets of glass and standard mats. But maybe with medium format film, those prints could be huge. Larger scale means larger glass, oversize 60&quot; mats, shipping gets more expensive, everything is more difficult and cost goes up exponentially.<p>There&#x27;s no typical scenario, that&#x27;s why custom framing is so interesting. A microchip manufacturer could spend the same framing chip designs as the cigar bar framing ads for urinals.",1412373546

Something most people just take for granted and figure it just works like magic. The job those people have is mostly thankless and comes with killer stress. (Listening to a few recordings, I&#x27;d have a breakdown within a day on that job.)<p>On a more HN-note, I saw an interesting glimpse into how some of the responders view privacy. In context of what to do for VoIP phones, the general feeling at one NENA meeting was &quot;ISPs should provide detailed location information on any access lines to VoIP devices&quot;. The implication there is that any software on your computer or network would be able to do a real &quot;geo IP&quot; lookup because your ISP would have to provide your address of record to anything using the connection. No one seemed to realise the massive problem this would create.<p>The other interesting thing is that PSAPs are heading towards an interconnected model. The idea being (at least a few years ago) that PSAPs could all be on the Internet, and transfer calls to each other with SIP + some nutty extensions, bridge in translators, a real utopia. Which sounds nice until you realise so many PSAPs are woefully underfunded and in no position to be running critical infrastructure on the Internet. Hopefully states would step up and provide adequate funding and it could be pulled off as a government project. But it&#x27;s not so clear, and there&#x27;s a long way to go. One PSAP told us he didn&#x27;t want us sending calls from &quot;Internet phones&quot; because his PSAP equipment might get a virus (over his voice line.)",1412372554

Two - the cellular networks on whole are best effort, cellular as a technology cannot be as reliable as a wireline hookup, period.<p>In the future, I believe the move to VoLTE will make E911 more reliable, as it will enable more location data to be sent from the handset at the time of call, but until then, the most reliable way to get geolocation data to a PSAP is to use a landline, period, the landline telephone, is and will remain more reliable, consistent and predictable than any of the technologies replacing it.<p>As far as why the carrier couldnt be reached? likely calling the wrong place - Sprint FWIW is and has been in the midst of a forklift network upgrade for a couple years now, its just wrapping up now, but parts of the network have been partially non-functional for hours or days at a time - I know however that regular e911 drive testing is a part of test and turnup, and the planned maintenance process for Sprint.",1412371773

I also think you can learn a lot more from failure than success, but I might be biased there.  My management experience is in large bureaucracies.<p>Here are my top ways to fail as a technical manager:<p>1. You don&#x27;t understand what the people who work for you do well enough to know good work from bad work. This has all sorts of bad ramifications. You can&#x27;t be a leader if you don&#x27;t understand what&#x27;s going on. Does that mean you should be able to write code?  Maybe. . .it depends on the job.  It does mean that &quot;Don&#x27;t write code&quot; is not universally good advice.<p>2. People don&#x27;t trust you. This might not be because of anything you&#x27;ve done but things you&#x27;ve failed to do, like chat with people regularly and give them bad news quickly.<p>3. You don&#x27;t manage the careers of subordinates so that they feel like you&#x27;re helping them succeed. This is particularly important for the typical engineering personality type that finds &quot;selling yourself&quot; repulsive. Don&#x27;t have enough data to &quot;sell&quot; a subordinate at review time?  See #1.<p>4. You don&#x27;t set a goal or direction.  Details are the engineers&#x27; job. You have to know about the details and understand them, but your job is to give a clear overall direction and goal and help the team stick to it, and change it when necessary. If you&#x27;ve hired good people who want to accomplish something, they&#x27;ll do that. Just make it clear what <i>that</i> is.<p>5. You forget that your success might occur in spite of you. Especially as a middle manager, you&#x27;re like an insurance company; if there&#x27;s anyone on your team that causes that team to be a success, you look like a success.  A mostly dysfunctional team (or a completely dysfunctional manager) may still succeed. Understand that great people risk a lot more working for you than you risk having them work for you. If you&#x27;re successful, you should live in fear that you&#x27;re doing everything wrong and constantly check yourself. You also need to hide this fear from everyone.<p>6. You don&#x27;t live to serve. Your goal every day should be to give your people the tools they need to succeed.",1412371290

They&#x27;re great for thick impasto and brighter colours, but they don&#x27;t hold up well at all for classical oil-painting styles. (They&#x27;re a lot like tempera in that respect; chiaroscuro marks the beginning of oils and the diminishing of tempera because the binder doesn&#x27;t permit non-black pigments to be as dark as oils do.) Alkyds are a little friendlier for quick work, and do have real depth, but they lock up nearly as quickly as acrylics while requiring nearly as much polymerization time as oils before they can be varnished. Believe me, artists would <i>love</i> a medium that has the optical properties and open time of oils (which can be hours to days, depending on the pigment and the use of dryers), but didn&#x27;t have a tendency to yellow and could be properly finished in under six months.

Life is too fucking short not to focus on building awesome things with awesome people.<p>Alas, that&#x27;s kind of what Apple tried in the late 80s, early 90s, and it basically cost them the company until they were finally able to pay NeXT to acquire them.<p>There are sad, annoying practicalities in running a business, and sometimes that changes hiring practices from the ideal. :(<p>EDIT:<p>The real issue is that the Internet has made it <i>trivial</i> to look at greener grass everywhere, and see how raw a deal one might be getting.

Imagine, before digital distribution, tracking every movie ticket, every rental, every purchase (don&#x27;t forget discounts like matinée tickets, coupons, clearance, etc), every clip used where royalties are due, etc ... and paying royalties to every face in your movie, at various rates depending on screen time or &#x27;voice&#x27; time...<p>As the talent, it&#x27;s just easier to demand a large payment up front and just forget about the royalties. As the studio, it&#x27;s easier just to pay that amount up front. Then, magic voodoo accounting and <i>poof</i> any statutory royalties are eliminated.<p>I suppose in this case, the &quot;honest&quot; studio is negotiating that large up-front payment to its talent rather than trying to sell the talent on the eternal royalties that never come.",1406681862

Function composition <i>consumes</i> outputs as it produces inputs, in equal measure — in f(g(x)), the domain of f is bounded by the codomain of g, which is itself bounded by x. If g has three branches, but f always outputs a value that takes the first branch, then g will only ever follow one branch in your test; you won’t get a combinatoric explosion of possible branches taken.<p>You might be thinking more of testing several expressions independently, e.g. assert([f(x), g(x)] == […]).

8105862,comment,8104161,8104161,4,0,marvin,,,"Very nice overview. I am just in the final stages of a Masters thesis in data visualization, and this article gives a really good bird&#x27;s eye view of the field. The visualization field is really too broad that most programmers could be expected to know more than some key points, but given that vision is the highest-bandwidth sense, visual techniques are often given less credit than they deserve. As long as there needs to be a human in the loop, you need good visualizations if your data is more than trivial. D3 is probably good for its domain, but intuition tells me you&#x27;ll have a problem if you mainly use Javascript to handle a 20GB dataset. (I&#x27;m not dismissing this categorically; I am not very familiar with these tools).<p>Unfortunately, to my knowledge there aren&#x27;t any comprehensive textbooks that cover visualization from the ground up. We didn&#x27;t use a single textbook in my 2-year degree; all lectures were heavily based on research papers. Central topics if you want to read up on this is perception (which color scales should you use? how many parameters can you plausibly put in one plot?), different visualization techniques for different data (scatterplots, histograms, treemaps, horizon graphs, volume rendering, graph drawing with edge bundling, +++), interactivity and applications of basic techniques (Visual Analytics, Interactive Visual Analysis).<p>A multitude of scientific fields use different visualization tools, so it can be tricky to find the relevant material for whatever it is you&#x27;re working with. But in general, I think the data mining/big data/analytics fields could do very well with a bigger focus on visual techniques. If you get the right visualizations for your data, the truth often just jumps out of the screen. GPUs can let you work with multi-gigabyte datasets at interactive framerates, although I haven&#x27;t seen a lot of practical applications of this yet. Can also be used for non-spatial data, if you&#x27;re clever with CUDA or just use the shader data structures creatively. Would be interesting to hear if anyone in the industry uses this yet.",1406681546

If we moved to a system where the raw data was shared automatically then the number of “exclusives” any group could get from a study would decline, but the value of each paper would go up. As long as everyone was sharing then I don’t think funding bodies would stop funding groups willing to go to the effort of doing large studies. It is the funding that determines what research is done, not the how many papers a group can milk out of the study. It should be quality over quantity.<p>[1] For those outside of science what happen now is groups with the data hold back the data and then use access to the data to establish “collaborations” - basically they will give you access to the data as long as you put their names on any resulting papers.

Even this would have appeared as a good opportunity if Flipkart was kind of de-facto e-commerce business in India. Turns out that it is not. Snapdeal, Junglee (Amazon India) are pretty close. Myntra was the leader in apparel and fashion products sale online which was then acquired by Flipkart.

Recently I was able to test a direct drive (The motor is in the bottom bracket and assists you pedalling). It&#x27;s phenomenal.<p>I could easily go up very steep hills without a lot of effort and I weigh 270lb. I could even vary the help it was giving me and choose to have more of a workout.<p>What I would suggest is that if you are on the heavy side or intend to carry heavy loads, direct drive is the best for you.<p>One negative side to the e-bike legislation is that in the UK, it&#x27;s speed limited to assist up to 15MPH and on 250W motors. To a certain extent I have no issue with the assist cutting out at 15MPH (20 would be nicer), however the 250W limit reduces torque and if you had a load of shopping with you, this could be an issue.<p>The issue I find with the Copenhagen wheel is that it is trying to think for you and you control the wheel through your phone. When riding, I prefer not to remove my hands from the handle bar. Most if not all ebike configurations place the motor control near a thumb as if you were holding on to the handle bar. My criticism may be unfounded, but you need control sometimes at a moments notice.<p>The other issue is one of battery charging. Most people that I know that have an ebike, have bought two chargers, one for work and one for home, and charge their batteries at both ends by removing the battery from the bike and leaving the bike locked up in the parking lot.

Once area we could stop is useless data-mined correlation studies that show statistical significance (assuming you ignore that data-mining has occurred) between action X and outcome Y - the sort where a retrospective study of 500,000 nurses finds that eating candied peanuts reduces prostate cancer by 15%. The rule of thumb in any of these studies is that unless the effect is 300% or greater (smoking and lung cancer is 1500%) then the result is certain to be garbage.<p>2. We need less “novel” research and more replication of past results. The whole scientific system is set up to reward novelty over accuracy. It is so bad that unless I have seen two independent groups repeat something I doubt it is real no matter how famous the group.<p>3. We need to reward being right over being first. Right now groups rush papers out so they don’t get scooped and so don’t check their results as well as they should. I would personally like to remove the date off all scientific papers to stop these silly games - after all if something is true does it become less true just because it was published last year rather than last week.<p>4. We need to reward people who put the effort into replicating work. A simple proposal would be to give publication right to every group that replicated (or could not replicate) a study in the same journal. If some study is published in Nature and you go to the effort of replicating it then you should get an automatic Nature publication.<p>5. Stop scientist from holding on to raw data. In theory scientist are supposed to share their data, but in practice this doesn’t happen very often. It should be possible to report groups that don’t share data to the funding bodies and if they are found to not be not sharing (or only sharing some of the data) then the group is banned from getting any new funding. It would only take a few banning to stop this immoral data hoarding.",1406678811

First, I think it&#x27;s great that promotion-readiness is decided by an employee and not her manager(s). Second, when promotion packet is written, it gets reviewed by a promotion committee, most likely in another campus, and there is a very high likelihood that promotions are granted more objectively compared to the manager&#x27;s peers (and up the chain, depending on a target level like it&#x27;s done in Microsoft, long before peer feedback is written). Promotion committee decisions get reviewed and iterated to satisfy the promotion budget, and those lucky ones who meet the bar, get promoted. Sounds like a pretty fair system to me.",1384231926

We also had a course that was just mechanical engineering labs which covered topics like fluids and heat transfer. Even in courses like Machine Design, the focus was somewhat on design, with all the assignments being miniature design projects where you had to specify real components and justify your choices to the instructor and class. Still students graduated with essentially no practical engineering skills.<p>You have to take it upon yourself to get the practical experience in your area of interest, be it through co-op jobs and/or student teams. If you don&#x27;t, the job market is not interested in you.<p>I think there is going to be some changes coming to traditional engineering education relatively soon.

6715870,comment,6712703,6713549,5,0,bemurphy,,,"Interesting question, I can point out a few interesting differences I know of.  Take note, I have more experience with Couch and its ilk than MongoDB, but I know some of Mongo&#x27;s feature set.<p>tl;dr: You&#x27;d probably see the most difference with how a) the data is distributed and replicated and b) how you query data.<p>CouchDB (as of the 1.5 release) offers master-master (including offline) replication.  It does not offer sharding.  Cloudant&#x27;s BigCouch does implement a dynamo-like distribution system for data that is slated for CouchDB 2.x iirc.  Mongo on the other hand does support sharding via mongos, and you can build replica sets within each shard.  It does not as far as I know support master-master.  This is probably the biggest data-distribution difference between the two.<p>MongoDB support a more SQL-like ad hoc querying system, so you could query for drink recipes with 3 or less ingredients that have vodka in them, for instance.  You&#x27;d still need indexes on the data you are querying for performance.<p>CouchDB queries are facilitated via javascript or erlang map reduce views, which serve as indexes you craft.  An additional &#x27;secondary-index&#x27; like query facility is to use a lucene plugin and define searchable data.  Cloudant has this baked into their offering, and their employees maintain the plugin on github (<a href=""https://github.com/rnewson/couchdb-lucene"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/rnewson/couchdb-lucene</a>)<p>MongoDB has the ability to do things like append a value to a document array.  In Couch, you&#x27;d likely read the entire document, append to the array in your app, and put the document back on Couch.  It does have an update functionality that can sometimes isolate things more than this, but I haven&#x27;t seen it used as much.  Mongo can also do things like increment counters, while Couch cannot (though CouchBase can).<p>There&#x27;s a host of other differences.  Mongo has a much broader API, while CouchDB takes a more simple http verb like approach (get, put and delete see the heaviest use).  Depending on your situation, one might be a better fit, or you might simply grok one more than the other.<p>As far as why Mongo gets used more often, I think the closer-to-SQL ad-hoc queries made more sense to people transitioning from stores like MySQL.  The CouchDB view/map-reduce stuff is a bit more of a mindset shift (see the View Collation wiki entry for an example of this at <a href=""http://wiki.apache.org/couchdb/View_collation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.apache.org/couchdb/View_collation</a>).  CouchDB was also taken hits for being slower than Mongo, but I suspect it was the map-reduce stuff that really steered some folks the other way.",1384231205

This works better.<p>A key question in the idea of &quot;fair compensation&quot; is what do you mean by &quot;fair&quot;?<p>If one of your superstar outliers is contributing 5x, 10x or more business value than the average, what does fair compensation look like? Is it 100% of the compensation of the average? 110%? 150%? 250%?<p>In my experience, few firms have compensation structures so flexible as to reflect the true range of contributions of different employees. As a result, their compensation philosophy tends more towards &quot;equal compensation&quot; than &quot;commensurate compensation&quot;.<p>The question is whether fair lies closer to &quot;equal&quot; or to &quot;commensurate&quot; on the spectrum.<p>(I obviously understand the argument that equal might result in a more cooperative workforce and a stronger company, all other things being equal. But the very strongest performers, assuming their strength is portable to another firm, will have an incentive to migrate to a firm willing to compensate them more commensurately to their contribution, again, all other things being equal.<p>Once one of these firms springs into being, they may become a magnet for talent as great people like to work with and for other great people. If one can do that to a greater extent at this magnet firm AND have a higher income, enabling more retirement and family financial security, better vacations, etc, those will be powerfully aligned forces.)",1384230619

Secondarily, it helps &quot;trim the fat&quot;. People focus most on the latter, but the main draw is the former. It also is meant as a way to keep raters accountable for the performance management process and avoid rating errors, most obviously the leniency bias but also the halo bias.<p>Finally, in some organizations it&#x27;s just a convenient way to distribute rewards (comp, promotions). While this is a highlight of it in any application, the focus on that as the primary benefit is less than ideal. But convenience is its own reward for many.<p>This concept is intended for use at the more senior levels in the company and typically not meant to be done within teams/groups/divisions, but rather across teams/groups/divisions.<p>The whole system is designed around creating a workforce with maximum potential, if not maximum performance. There are some simulation studies that have borne this out, but I&#x27;m wary of trusting the validity of simulated models in complex systems and social phenomenon. While evidence suggests neither raters or ratees react well to the system, actual evidence of behavior (e.g., attrition) and performance generally don&#x27;t show the expected negative outcomes.<p>It&#x27;s thought level of interdependence in one&#x27;s role would be positively associated with poor performance, but I don&#x27;t know of any evidence about this either way. It&#x27;s also thought that the system works best in a culture that sends similar signals, like high-performance consulting cultures. Again, I know of no data about this.<p>Here is a decent, if somewhat old, PDF that is classic forced distribution reading.

Great for passing per-request variables (i.e. CSRF tokens, saved forms, etc) between your middleware and your wrapped handlers. Set up some Get and Set wrappers around your specific keys so you can avoid writing out type assertions every time you want to retrieve the stored object.<p> go.stripe (<a href=""https://github.com/drone/go.stripe"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/drone/go.stripe</a>) - a fairly complete Stripe library.<p> blackfriday (<a href=""https://github.com/russross/blackfriday"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/russross/blackfriday</a>) - Markdown processor.<p>Obviously, frameworks (and ecosystems...) like Flask, Sinatra, Django and Rails have an advantage in that you can get stuff done today: they do a lot for you. And, for many use-cases, performance will never be a problem.<p>Saying that, writing HTTP logic in Go has been surprisingly easy, and the small amount of extra boilerplate you have to write (if you&#x27;re sans-framework like me) is nice when you realise how darned fast your application is. Being able to deploy a single binary and front-end it with nginx also reduces a ton of complexity.<p>PS: Once I finish this thing off over the Christmas break, I&#x27;m hoping to write up a few articles on the bits-and-pieces that took a bit of time to &quot;get right&quot;.

(Based on debt capital rather than equity capital, but just an example)<p>You and Fred have a common friend, Bob. Bob wants to start a new business and needs to borrow money.<p>First, Bob borrows $10,000 from Fred and later on, Bob borrows $20,000 from you.<p>Some months go by, and the business isn&#x27;t doing well; Bob (or rather, his company) eventually files for bankruptcy, listing $6,000 in assets. How should this remaining value be distributed among you and Fred, which both have a claim to it because of the debt owed to you?<p>One way to divide up the remaining amount would be in a <i>pro rata</i> method: Bob borrowed $30,000 total, 1/3rd of which was from Fred and 2/3rds of which was from you. So, you should get $4,000 and Fred should get $2,000. (This is known as <i>pari passu</i> I believe)<p>However, this isn&#x27;t the only way things could be done. One could say that because Fred lent money first, he should get <i>paid back in full</i> before you do. Or perhaps one could argue the opposite.<p>You could argue back and forth about what the most &quot;fair&quot; way to divide up the assets is, but in reality what matters is what the rules outlined in capital structure specify.

MasterCard also enters into foreign currency forward contracts to offset possible changes in value of assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. MasterCard does not engage in proprietary trading of derivatives. Its objective for entering into transactions in derivative financial instruments is to reduce exposure to transaction gains and losses resulting from fluctuations of foreign currencies against its functional currencies. MasterCard engages in derivatives transactions solely and exclusively for the purpose of hedging foreign currency exchange risk incurred in the operation of its business.</i><p><i>As noted above, MasterCard has approximately 20,000 customers, and processes payment card transactions from more than 210 countries and territories. MasterCard derives approximately 60% of its revenue from outside of the United States. Given the global reach of our company, we are deeply impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in the operation of our business. MasterCard generates revenues and incurs expenses that are either transacted in, or valued based on, currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. For example, MasterCard charges its customers assessment fees for various services it provides to its customers, including the use of the MasterCard brand globally. These assessment fees are typically a percentage charge on a customer&#x27;s total volume of transactions incurred on MasterCard-branded cards. Because of MasterCard&#x27;s global presence, transactions effected in foreign currencies are converted into U.S. Dollars and the percentage charge (i.e., assessment fee) is calculated on this converted U.S. Dollar volume. Hence, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates impact the amount of U.S. Dollar assessment revenue MasterCard collects. Similarly, given our global footprint, we make significant expenditures and incur significant contractual obligations to make future expenditures in countries around the world for commercial activities, such as marketing, advertising, payroll and operations. These expenditures and obligations may be denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. This exposes MasterCard to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. In addition to our transactional exposures, we also hedge balance sheet assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. From time to time, MasterCard is also exposed to foreign exchange risks arising from overseas acquisitions.</i><p>Source: <a href=""https://www.fdic.gov/regulations/laws/federal/2011/11c89ad79.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.fdic.gov/regulations/laws/federal/2011/11c89ad79...</a>",1452524593

Or someone&#x27;s tenure depends on rabble rousing enough to get publicity to be seen as relevant.  Or someone&#x27;s hiring or tenure has to be denied for various acceptable or unacceptable demographic membership reasons or maybe just trivialities (this is academics after all) and they need a highly dramatic cover story.  Maybe some public museum only gets financial funding for &quot;human fossils&quot; and there&#x27;s a condo developer eyeing that block of land for redevelopment, and it sure would be convenient if the money dried up.<p>There&#x27;s probably a real dramatic story underneath the argument, but the journalist somehow managed to miss it.",1452524497

Google might project itself as champion of open source but the reality is their revenue, is a result of standing on open source. Without gnu and Linux they will not even exist.\nWhen they needed google maps users they opened up. But given their profit motive they will have to shut down others which conflict with their profit.\nIts better to port service to something open source, like openstreetmap. Google is turning into, do every evil to generate value for shareholders.\nI think RMS fears of closed source js are true. It&#x27;s like Windows Binary blobs.",1452524481

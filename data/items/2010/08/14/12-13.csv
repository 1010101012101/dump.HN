With that said, it's a good book but I prefer the first two books because they are more about Feynman's thoughts and ideas than anything.",1281790660

[any authority] could use those certificates to conduct virtually undetectable surveillance and attacks against those sites. [any authoritiy's] keys could also possibly be used to obtain access to some corporate VPNs.</i><p>[EDIT] Are there any monitoring tools I can install to question the validity or motive of a certificate?

This guy was seriously overdoing it or had poor form if his body was ""shot"" after two years. If you want to do low-rep, high-weight lifting, make sure that you get plenty of rest and don't do tons of volume. Find a program designed by a reputable strength-training coach (such as Mark Rippetoe or Bill Starr) and don't modify it. If your form is good, you don't do more volume than you should, and you're eating properly, your body certainly won't be ""shot"" after two years.",1281790419

I save the important downloaded messages in kmail on my desktop computer and I delete the rest locally.  If I ever accidentally delete an important email locally I just login to the gmail web interface and retrieve a new copy.<p>It's a good system because it archives all my email on the gmail server first, saves copies of the important messages locally, and eliminates more than 99% of my SPAM so I never have to deal with it.",1281789402

To me, this is no different than the arguments elsewhere in this discussion about needing money to ""travel"". Why do you need money ""to make a difference""? I don't have money but I run a website that makes a difference.  The number of people it reaches is currently small.  I have thought about it and I don't think throwing money at the problem would do any real good.  If I thought throwing money at the problem would work, I would be trying to start a foundation and raise the money to throw it at the problem. But I really think the current model of throwing money at the problem is part of the problem, not likely part of the solution.<p>Gates said something once like ""Automating an efficient system multiplies the efficiencies and automating an inefficient system multiplies the inefficiencies.""  I think throwing money at a problem does the same thing.  If the solution you have isn't really that good, more of it may make a bigger ""difference"" but not of the sort I want to see in the world.<p>You ""make a difference"" every day of your life.  What kind of difference are you making today?  And if it is not something you think is worthwhile, why put off ""making a difference"" until some mythical time when you have more money?<p>Sincere questions, not in any way intended to bust you.<p>Peace.",1281789205

Previously, dictatorship[corp] were allow to live peacefully because they control the media, and pretty much had control of their images.  The landscape has changed and everybody is the media.  I think it's to google's competitive advantage to be seen as good.  I don't think a lot of companies have notice the landscape has changed, so they conduct business as normal.<p>The game still is survival of the fittest, but for this landscape, the fittest are good.<p>Without a doubt Google has the popular vote. I constantly hear people compare SUN to Google. Sun died, when? lol<p>Conceive a scenario where Google died tomorrow; now compare that to when Sun passed[it really did?]. It's not the same thing.  ""Google"" is the most frequently used noun on HN, with almost 3 times the frequency of ""Apple""  [<a href=""http://chegra.posterous.com/word-frequencies-in-front-page-hn-titles"" rel=""nofollow"">http://chegra.posterous.com/word-frequencies-in-front-page-h...</a>]<p>Sun might be good for hackers, but Google takes it to a further extent and brought it to everybody.<p>Certain companies, besides their shareholders nobody cares if they live or die; nobody is super excited about their product. Nobody is saying they want to go work for them.\nThe only reason why they exist is because they were best of the first movers.<p>It's common practice when a company gets big in order to innovate it purchases smaller companies.  You don't innovate you die. All the big companies employ this strategy(really, when last Apple bought somebody-NeXT?).\nAs an entrepreneur or a Hacker and being aware of the current situation, I think if you were going to sell your company you will stay away from Oracle; they will kill your culture. Also, given their business nature, they might even undercut you; it's more to your advantage to do business with someone who is good.  And this is where I think Oracle has lost its advantage, it wouldn't be able to innovate.",1281788287
1603267,comment,1602169,1603063,0,0,raganwald,,,"Ah, I see the misunderstanding. I don't mean that it stalls framework development, I mean it stalls projects. If I'm starting a new project today for a mobile app, do I go with jQTouch today? Or do I wait and see how jQuery Mobile goes?<p>This happens all the time in the industry. Familiarity breeds contempt, so it's easy to make a list of problems with jQTouch. But whatever is announced but not shipping has no bugs. It has no performance trade-offs. It is effortlessly compatible with mobile devices back to the Radio Telephones of the 1970s. And its programming model is intuitive, flexible, and powerful with no learning curve.<p>How can you resist waiting? What project is so urgent that you take a chance targeting jQTouch when it will obviously be made extinct by jQUery Mobile? So an announcement has a chilling effect on framework use, that's what I meant.<p>Alas, no way around it, you can't drum up support for it without perturbing the environment a little.",1281788207

219098,comment,218862,219030,0,0,maurycy,,,"This text, especially arguments against, bases on the strong distinction between programming languages' syntax and semantics. Let me come up quickly with two examples of fuziness between syntax and semantics of programming languages, how the syntax affected the semantics.<p>While the semantics frequently does not vary within a given paradigm, sometimes a different syntax gives you completely different point of view. For instance, Polish notation, also known as prefix notation, makes it easy to come up with s-expressions, what turns out to change the way we think about programming.<p>Also, programming languages' syntax can work as reward&punishment tools. A hash is slighty the same hash in all programming languages. Neverthless, dynamic languages made it so easy to manipulate on them that in many ways they've dominated the programs written in those languages.<p>It is also important to remember that a language is not an abstract contruct. It has its uses, existing design patterns, good practices, as well as existing libraries. ""Meaning just is use"". Even if you can say nearly everything in all languages, sometimes it is harder to say one thing in another.<p>(as a boring guy I must say that I feel sorry that such indirectly thought provoking post got only 7 points, lossing popularity with the Vista problem)",1213649452

219090,comment,218891,219029,0,0,markbao,,,"Like the article said, if consumers want more features. I think it's just that Asian consumers are willing to pay for a premium for more and more features in a mobile phone, while that's not necessarily the case here (simpler phones, etc.) With this, the mobile telecom companies can implement more advanced systems and features into their mobiles. That's at least my speculation.<p>Also - forgot to add. Micro-commodities are KING in Asia. QQ, the AIM of China, offers a MySpace-like social networking system built on top of their 160-million-subscriber instant messaging system, where micro-commodities like profile customizations for <i>x</i> RMB are just a no-brainer: it's cheap, buy it. Of course, this generates more sales, which thus generates more profits.<p>QQ even has their own ""currency"" - QQ Coin, a virtual currency, a 1:1 coin:RMB exchange for purchasing virtual (or sometimes even real) merchandise. [1] 2008Q1 revenues for Tencent were $204mln, profits of $77mln at a margin of 38%. [2]<p>This is definitely evident in the mobile market. Mobile subscribers in the US are prone to buying some ringtones and customizations, but in China these micro-commodities generate a lot of purchasers - and a lot of money. It's not something that we can completely imitate in the US, since it's part of their culture to purchase these micro-commodities.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QQ#QQ_Coin"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QQ#QQ_Coin</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.tencent.com/ir/pdf/news20080514a_e.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tencent.com/ir/pdf/news20080514a_e.pdf</a>",1213648483

Personally, I would have the user hover over the blue link, then have the grey background box come up as a sort of guide for the eye to follow towards the pop-up, and have the pop-up surrounded with the grey background box as well (at the minute it has no background 'frame'). This way you guide the user from the link to the pop-up and they know exactly which pop-up relates to the link.<p>Also, I would reduce the size of the tag cloud.

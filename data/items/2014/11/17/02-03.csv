HTTP is a terrible format to parse, with lots of idiotic extra features that have no legitimate usage. But it&#x27;d be fairly easy for them to harden things, just abort if they run into anything weird.<p>Which may be a way around this. Run a local proxy that does stuff like use line folding, comments in headers, and other things to make their parse code abort. Of course, you then run the risk of breaking compatibility with actual HTTP servers (with good reason-those are bad features and such messages are probably an attack). And of course the ISP can always fix their code.",1416192991
8616639,comment,8616144,8616144,0,0,dimitar,,,"Here is the common ground and controversy between most economists on the situation, I think it is interesting how much common ground there is:<p>The common ground:<p>* The government of Japan faces budget constraints; it cannot tax more than a certain amount and that includes seigniorage (taxing using inflation).<p>* Right now Japan doesn&#x27;t seem to be immediately close to those constraints since interest rates and inflation are low.<p>* Lowering taxes, spending more and depreciating the currency will expand the economy, but rates will increase and so will inflation (among with wages).<p>* Inflation expectations can create actual inflation. It can be generalized that different people will demand higher prices in advance if they can, since they know their costs will rise. The same applies to interest rate and there is a link between them (investors demand higher yields if inflation is expected).<p>* Default and excessive inflation can be a result of too much expansionary policy (eventually, what is too much is up for debate), but they can destroy the gains and make the economy worse off.<p>The disagreement (you can see that its actually a spectrum of opinion and there are differences between the details of the policies, but for clarity I&#x27;ve divided them neatly into two camps):<p>* School A believes expansionary policy will make Japan default because the government will have lost control, since expectations can make interest rates and inflation jump rapidly. They site that the level of Debt to GDP is over 200% as evidence. They say the government should not lose credibility or else.<p>* School B believes that the expansionary policy is so hard to actually pull off that some expectations of inflation and higher rates are desirable. Since rates stay low and deflation is always around the corner it seems that the government can easily reverse too much expansionary policy, far before a default appears to be likely. Additionally Increased GDP will bring more revenue, decreasing the need to rely on inflation after a certain point. They joke that the &quot;government should credibly promise to be irresponsible&quot; to get out of the bad equilibrium that is the lost decades.<p>-----<p>A political compromise appears to have been made by mixing expansionary policy with the decision to increase the sales tax. Since this caused a recession school B feels vindicated - getting to a default and inflation path is really hard. Interest rates and inflation refuse to bulge.<p>However the lack of progress will add even more to the debt to GDP, perversely aiding school A (even thought some of them might agree that B were right in the previous period). So the end result has been 20 years of the government oscillating between those two positions, without reaching a point where either side can victory (default or significant GDP growth).",1416192976

US citizens are guaranteed a trial. Principles are worth a lot less if the administration gets to decide when to apply them.<p>Regarding NSA v. CIA, I admit coming into the conversation without having read the thread. I merely sought to add information to the leaf. Thank you very much for the high quality comment and information.<p>Regarding damage to US citizens, one reason is that we do know that NSA contractors and employees stalked lovers and rivals and used these capabilities for personal means. There were also reports of nude photo sharing.<p>There were also several prominent Muslim community leaders with no connection to any terrorists or extreme ideas inside the United States who were targeted by the surveillance apparatus merely for their religious expression. I don&#x27;t think I need to argue why profiling individuals based on their creed or color causes harm to these classes of people.<p>Extending this analysis - we do not know how these systems will be used in the future. In particular Nixon left office for spying on a handful of people. What would a Hoover or a Nixon do with the NSA capabilities? The broader point here is that the calculus of damage should <i>not</i> merely be about singular instances of damage today. It&#x27;s a bad idea to build a nuclear reactor on a fault line. Not because it has already done damage. But because of the magnitude and the likelihood of what it may contrasted with alternatives.<p>Another example of damage to US citizens is the use of purposefully backdoored services and infrastructure. It is not theoretical or speculative to suggest that these weaknesses may be used by maligned actors: there are several examples today of intercept systems being compromised by interested parties for geopolitical and economic reasons.<p>Finally, we adhere to principles of civil liberties not just because they are good things on individual bases but also because adopting them as policies gives a net benefit to society (see historical evolutions of Utilitarianism and arguments against forced organ donation). That is one could argue as Bentham did, that rights are nonsense on stilts, except that societies that don&#x27;t guarantee these rights suffer the pychological consequences of living in a state where no rights are garunteed. To presuppose that all damage must be physical in nature is to be ignorant of the history of the organization of men.",1416192831

Europeans went down the austerity route and are stuck with consistently underperforming economy and the threat of deflation. The US has turned the corner and is a job creating machine again including the first real signs of inflationary pressure through rising wages. The most unusual thing I can see about Japan is it&#x27;s trying to take the US and Euro approach together at the same time. Their problem is deflation. Deflation tells consumers not to buy as you wait 6 months and it&#x27;ll be cheaper. It&#x27;s a deadly downward spiral. So the Japanese are trying to stoke their economy to create inflation which in turn spurs consumption. Yet they go into this with a massive amount of debt already so are raising consumption taxes at the very time they need consumption. Something has to give.",1416192770

8616622,comment,8615501,8615501,0,0,srean,,,"It is a little unfortunate that one of the few (or only) underlying abstraction of the machine that C chose to leave out was that of coroutines. I find this rather ironic because I have been told that PDPs, the virtual machine model that C is based on, had instruction level support for exchanging control very efficiently. I have also heard that VMs like LLVM aren&#x27;t that good at portably exposing efficient exchange of control between stack frames (please correct me if I am wrong here).<p>Since C is the implementation medium for many other languages coroutines did not get as much visibility as it should have.<p>I can only speculate why C left it out. Perhaps it was felt that it wont port too well outside of the PDP family. The other reason could be that coroutine as an abstraction completely leaves out how they ought to be scheduled. Perhaps they did not want to flesh out a schedule that would be portable everywhere. It is not a very satisfactory explanation because C wasnt that shy to leave things undefined.

8616594,comment,8615962,8615962,0,0,cwyers,,,"Upon reflection, I don&#x27;t think this is a systemd problem -- which is to say, many other distros (not even ones sponsored by Red Hat -- Arch, SuSE, Mageia, NixOS, etc.) have managed to switch to systemd as a default without this kind of a fuss. It&#x27;s only Debian where this kind of a shitstorm has kicked off -- even Gentoo, which has been a rather vocal systemd holdout, offers systemd and doesn&#x27;t seem to have this kind of political infighting about it. Now, yes, Debian and its downstreams have a large part of the Linux userbase, so there&#x27;s apt to be more attention paid to it. But I&#x27;m starting to think this is a Debian problem, not a systemd problem.<p>And the reason I think that is because this isn&#x27;t a question of whether or not people do or don&#x27;t use systemd. It&#x27;s a question of who is going to do the work to ensure that people who choose not to use systemd can continue to use popular packages like GNOME, etc. And to this end, Ian Jackson is leading a vocal group that is willing to use ANY means at hand -- the Technical Committee, General Resolutions, whatever -- in order to cudgel Debian package maintainers and upstream software into doing the work that they think needs to be done in order to support their desire not to use systemd. The problem in a volunteer project like Debian, forcing volunteers to do work they don&#x27;t want to doesn&#x27;t lead to the volunteers doing the work you insist they should do, it leads to volunteers leaving. And the upstreams are not going to respond to Jackson&#x27;s quite frankly childish attempts to bully them into continuing to support sysvinit from now until the end of time. And until Jackson and his backers step into the breach to actually write freaking code to do what they want to instead of politicking to try and force others to write they code they want, it&#x27;s going to continue to drag the Debian project into this kind of a mess.",1416192170

As of last year, three other Americans are known to have been killed by drone strikes outside the US: Samir Khan, Abdulrahman Al-Awlaki and Jude Kenan Mohammed.  None were specifically targeted - Samir Khan was killed during the strike against the elder Al-Awlaki, the younger Al-Awlaki was killed during a strike targeting Ibrahim al-Banna in Yemen, and Jude Kenan Mohammed was killed during a strike against a compound in Pakistan.  All were killed by CIA drones, not DOD drones (NSA is part of the DOD; CIA is not).  The Attorney General declassified the reasoning for targeting the elder Al-Awlaki[1], which was ultimately decided at the Presidential level - not by the NSA.<p>That said, this is beside the point - when the media is stirring up a frenzy about the NSA and civil liberties, they&#x27;re not talking about CIA drone strikes in Yemen.

The buses would arrive at school a good half an hour before school started (why, I could not tell you), so in practice you had to be up before 6AM to catch the bus (maybe a bit later if you were less meticulous than I was). And even when you were old enough to drive a car, you couldn&#x27;t get <i>that</i> much more sleep out of it. I was pretty much continually sleep deprived from 12-18 because of this.<p>The ironic thing is, as an elementary schooler, I would frequently wake up much earlier than I needed to be to watch cartoons/play video games/read/do homework/etc. It was only after hitting puberty that I actually needed the extra sleep time, and that&#x27;s exactly when they hit you with the schedule change. And people wonder why teenagers are so grumpy these days.<p>As far as I can tell, the reasoning behind this is &quot;parents drive their elementary school-aged kids to school and need the extra time.&quot; The vast majority of kids, myself included, rode the bus from kindergarten onwards, so I guess this is just another case where the upper crust got to fuck everyone else over for the sake of their own convenience.<p>EDIT: The other half was the school-run extracurriculars that started in middle school. I remember an attempt to start our high school later being shot down; the athletes didn&#x27;t want to stay any later than they already were, and the sports coaches didn&#x27;t want to lose any practice time.

Contrary to what one would expect, Japanese firms are actually flush with money, but due to Abenomics, the weakness of Yen means they are investing more and more abroad, rather than putting the resources in improving its own infrastructure. We all know about Softbank&#x27;s recent investments in India and South East Asia. And it&#x27;s not just limited to Tech or even the private sector, even infra firms are investing in troves abroad, especially in South East Asia. In a way the Japanese growth rate doesn&#x27;t take into account the rent its entities are receiving from abroad. So the short term picture might actually be rosier than the numbers of would suggest.<p>The bigger problem is actually long term weaknesses that this trend will expose.<p>Another huge problem is consumer lending. Most Japanese banks are actually pretty stringent when it comes to lending to their own people. So even if low interest rates might encourage consumer borrowing appetite, there&#x27;s very little supply out there.

And when we resize that art, we don&#x27;t interpolate the color values(unless we want it to look like shit), we use a simple drop-sample or nearest-neighbor. But when we resize photographic images, suddenly we have a reason to do other things. Take for example this Stack Overflow answer on Lanczos resampling. [0] It describes exactly what you say we can&#x27;t and don&#x27;t use, but is actually used every day in Photoshop: a filter kernel that produces ringing artifacts on black-white patterns. As I allude to with the pixel art, it depends on the source content. When we get an image off of a camera, it&#x27;s sampled in a way that assumes the pixels are points as impulses, and thus should be processed &quot;as if&quot; they are convolutions of the sinc function, even though the data itself is &quot;just&quot; points. Digital photographs always look blurry or noisy when examined pixel-by-pixel, and only form coherency to our eyes when viewed more distantly. For similar reasons, pixel artists can&#x27;t downsample and process arbitrary photos and pass them off as legitimate pixel art, because the original content isn&#x27;t designed towards the display of square or near-square pixels.<p>[0] <a href=""http://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/10931/what-is-lanczos-resampling-useful-for-in-a-spatial-context"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/10931/what-is-lanczos...</a>",1416190118

I<p>Sorry that does seem confusing. Let me try to clear it up.<p>The point was that the main thing students should be doing -- getting an education, whether it prepares them for college or not was at the top of the list. Students being able to pick classes and specialize was not a top priority.<p>Then another point was that _optionally_ many had opportunity to further their interests by joining an external &quot;club&quot; or organizing one around the school. But these were optional and everyone did it if they wanted it. I didn&#x27;t for example, my friends beleonged to a airplane modeling club and so on.<p>My argument was that the choice and ability to specialize starting in middle school as well as having to switch schools teachers, having different classmates every class  is stressful enough and a uniform set of classes everyone takes is better. If anything just because it reduces the emotional stress of having to fit in different cliques or getting used to new schools and so on.<p>The reason I make personal annectodes is that I participated in both systems and can compare the two, based on how it felt for me.<p>Not to say I am extolling or saying all things were better and one should just copy that system of education -- there was lots of corruption and cheating or instance.

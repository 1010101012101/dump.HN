Regarding the ""post on your wall,"" we definitely took into account the importance of what this statement may mean about the user. We decided to put an engaging phrase like ""Are people using websites like jobzey.com to find jobs?"". This way, it doesn't show the user's intent, but does create curiosity among the user's friends. Regarding the access of photos and videos, we don't actually need it at this moment, we are toying around with different ideas to better leverage all forms of a user data to provide more value to the job results page.

2930757,comment,2930553,2930621,16,0,skermes,,,"To expand on mrk-hn's comment,<p>I don't think the comparison is entirely without merit.  From what I can tell, a lot of the scorn directed at hipsters (or at least the ""hipster"" archetype/strawperson) stems from fact (or perception) that they value cultural artifacts based on the social status that they can leverage those artifacts for, rather than for any intrinsic value they might have.  Compare someone who tells their friends about a band because they like the lyrics of that one song they listened to all the time in high school, vs someone who tells their friends about the same band because they want to be the first to do so, gaining some reputation in the process.  (Obviously there are more subtle gradients of behaviors and motivations here, but lets stick to broad strokes.)<p>Apple's branding and advertising tends to exhibit a similar focus on how their products will improve your status, rather than on the capabilities of the actual hard/software.  Consider the 1984 Mac ad, or the iPod silhouette ads.  They weren't telling you to buy an iPod because it could hold more songs, they were telling you that if you had an iPod, you could be one of the happy beautiful people dancing on a soundstage.  Compare that to a run of GeneriCo (seriously, I've seen it like ten times but I can't recall the brand) ads that have been running for back-to-school PCs on Hulu.  The whole thing is a laundry list of features without any context for why they're going to make your life better.  And there's a creepy guy hanging on the wall of a girl's dorm room.  They haven't even grokked JWZ's level of marketing savvy (<a href=""http://www.jwz.org/doc/groupware.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jwz.org/doc/groupware.html</a>) let alone Apple's.<p>Collide that with some long-standing geek ethics (function over form, a hard-won appreciation for the inner beauty of seemingly ugly tech, etc) and a backlash isn't all that surprising.  The hipster thing is just convenient.  Hating on them is already a popular internet pastime, so throwing that (as above, somewhat spiritually appropriate) label on Apple is a nice shorthand for showing how much you don't care about how big bezels should be or whether your corners are rounded.  It doesn't help that there are a fairly substantial core group of Apple devotees who engage in some absurdly irrational behaviors for status-seeking reasons (which is pretty much what ""hipsterism"" is all about).  Why, our enraged geek wants to know, would anyone stand in line at an Apple store for hours for a new iPhone?  THAT IS WHAT THE INTERNET AND FEDEX IS FOR <i>SMAAASH</i><p>So, yeah.  Extending that to accusations of overpriced-ness is left as an exercise for the reader.",1314417237

His students often heard little snippets about the B5000, sometimes coincidental with diatribes against Pascal, particularly the arbitrary limitations like the limited set type.<p>When I was there in 84-88, undergrads started off in S-Algol which was a recursive descent compiled, tidied-up Algol that ran on a C-based beta^h^h^h^h virtual machine. Lovely, friendly little language.<p>After exposure to 'S', JH and SH classes switched to PS-Algol which had procedures as first class objects, so we learnt closures, and how to do really neat things like serialize closures to store (one calll), reflection, generate and compile code on the fly. Really a great language, and back in 85/86 or so, it had all this cool, safe stuff that Java didn't get until several iterations in.<p>I didn't stay on after I graduated, so I missed out on the next step, which was a sort of always live environment called Napier. I don't know much about it, but always imagine a sort of concurrent Algol based Smalltalk. That may be close or far off the mark.",1314416764

2930706,comment,2930331,2930639,1,0,sapphirecat,,,"The ""speed limit"" is on the outbound connections from Node to the service.  Node calls connect(), and receives a new port exclusively for that one connection.<p>A server <i>facing the Internet</i> can serve lots of clients because those clients have plenty of IP+port combinations to go around on their end, to allow the server to tell the difference among them even though it only has the one IP+port on its end.  But 60K node.js connections from one machine, <i>the frontend server with a single IP address,</i> to a single IP+port on the backend server, do not have that luxury.  All that identifies the connection now is the port number on the Node server, so it <i>must</i> be unique per connection.<p>Connection pools attempt to mitigate the problem by inserting a manager (the pool) in the middle, to accept larger numbers of requests from Node and try to schedule them on a lower, sustainable number of connections to the backend.  At least on an RDBMS, transactions require the app to have exclusive use of the connection for its request, so when all the real connections are scheduled out, new requests have to wait for an old connection to be relinquished.<p>EDIT: Going back to the blog post, it said, ""You really need your back-end services to scale out with node.js.""  Which I think means, your back end service should have multiple IP addresses, to alleviate the bottleneck described above.",1314415024

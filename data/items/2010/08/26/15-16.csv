The hypotheses are very fun to think of, but there's no guarantee that you've thought of everything that could have happened a thousand millennia ago(and you probably haven't). Baumeister brought up some very interesting points (that I'm sure riled up a lot of feminist feathers), but there are also holes in his argument, such as the two below.<p>First, there is no mechanism of action that backs up his claim that society uses men as expendable. It's easy to see that it would be adaptive (for the society itself) to use men this way, but there's no guarantee this will happen without a mechanism of action. In fact, society seems to have developed mechanisms (such as monogamous marriage) that act against allowing men to be disposable sources of semen.<p>Second, even accepting everything else, his essential claim that a woman can't increase the number of her descendants by acquiring wealth and prestige is clearly false. All she has to do is find a way to transfer the wealth/prestige to her son(s), who in turn can use it in the ways Baumeister indicated.",1282838277

The further to right you get, the smaller the movement to the right it takes to increase your trouble by the same amount. At the point where the graph gets asymptotic, a tiny movement to the right - an otherwise trivial thing going a tiny bit wrong - is enough to push you off the scale (i.e. you're dead).<p>The trap is that you can't see yourself falling into the pit, because it appears early on that problems aren't having a significant effect. This leads to overconfidence.  Then once you're in the pit, it becomes harder and harder to get back out again (i.e. you need a huge vertical movement for a small horizontal movement back to the left).

It may be easier to test, but it is just as unwieldy and difficult to maintain. It is the wrong solution to the problem.

If a country has better diet, or a less polluted environment, or people are less stressed (which itself can cause further problems, including physical problems), then I think all of that should be included.<p>Why shouldn't the average health be counted?

That&#x27;s the thing.  He absolutely could <i>not</i> read a newspaper if by read you mean understand the content of the articles.  He could mostly sound out sentences, with poor pronunciation and often using the wrong reading for various characters (e.g. pronouncing  as hng when it should be xng or vice versa).<p>He <i>could</i> write many, many characters based on English keywords and pinyin associated with them in his deck.  But as I&#x27;ve been trying to explain, words don&#x27;t map one to one across languages and learning a language isn&#x27;t simply a matter of memorizing words.  The case of using a deck for isolated Chinese characters is even worse since a character is a syllable as opposed to a word.  In modern Chinese, the vast vast majority of words are poly syllabic (i.e. multi-character compounds).<p>FYI, he had been studying some Chinese for a couple of years before going on the SRS craze.  And he didn&#x27;t take weekends off.  He put even <i>more</i> time into study, fortunately including some things other than decontextualized SRS-based study.  During the time I knew him, he largely backed off the SRS in favor of getting loads of comprehensible input in the form of media, talking to parents of his English students and his girlfriend&#x27;s friends.  Over time the input did lead to a better ear for the language, better pronunciation and the ability to read and actually understand.  It&#x27;s possible the first couple of years with the SRS gave him a good foundation that helped for the next three years of working with the language in context.

It does not have &quot;results&quot; other than the ability to retain that focus for a longer period of time or with fewer distractions.<p>In terms of understanding my mind, you seem to be very focused on absolute, objective outcomes. It is not that simple. What questions would you ask? And how would you measure the outcomes?<p>A lot of questions you might ask can only be evaluated by answers your own mind gives you, and you often can&#x27;t tell if those answers are objectively correct or just rationalizations.<p>What you can do is observe what you feel (physical sensations, or internal feelings), how you react, what you think, what brings out specific thoughts etc. and try to bring more of your actions under conscious scrutiny and control.<p>To go back to my example about impulse control and chocolate: If my mind tells me I deserve that chocolate, is it right or wrong? There is no objective truth to that, because the only arbiter is myself, and if there are rules that says I shouldn&#x27;t have chocolate, they are rules I set myself and rules I am allowed to change.<p>What meditation as a tool helps with in situations like that, is teach you techniques to &quot;catch&quot; your mind in the act of rationalizations to let you slow down and consciously evaluate those thoughts before accepting them. Instead of accepting that &quot;yes, I deserve that chocolate&quot;, I might think &quot;hold on, I have decided to diet; I can have that chocolate, but I&#x27;ll feel disappointed later that I had it&quot;. Or I might go &quot;yes, I do actually deserve that chocolate; I&#x27;ve done very well on that diet, and as long as it is just that one chocolate, it is an acceptable trade off&quot;. Neither decision is still correct or incorrect.<p>It might feel trite and underwhelming, but we tend to walk through our lives following hundreds of impulses a day that we don&#x27;t question, or even are aware of: We go one route instead of another to get somewhere. We pick one outfit instead of another. We pick certain meals. We say certain things instead of others. We smile at someone, or ignore them.<p>A lot of the time there are explanations for these actions that are plain as day if you pay attention. You can go through your life oblivious to the reasons, and thus not influence them consciously. Or you can pay more attention and more consciously decide which decisions to take.<p>The latter is not more correct. But in my experience it feels more rewarding, as I am often able to catch impulses for me to act in ways that counteract goals that I have set myself, and change my behaviour.<p>One thing I noticed, for example, was how I&#x27;d impulsively do small things avoid people to reduce social interactions with people I didn&#x27;t know well. This at the same time as I was trying to improve my social skills. Consciously paying attention helped me catch those impulses as they were happening and override them.",1372615470

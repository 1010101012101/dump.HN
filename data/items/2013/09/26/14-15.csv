He/she just thinks the public debate is being lost for the reasons cited. So I wouldn&#x27;t say I was on the &#x27;other side&#x27;.<p>I&#x27;m often frustrated by media coverage as well. What I once heard a professor describe as &#x27;climate porn&#x27;; photos of polar bears on ice bergs along with cataclysmic predictions of 20 meter sea level rise. It&#x27;s not productive because it makes the problems seem totally intractable and causes many people to just give up because they feel hopeless. Often the articles like that are based on a single more pessimistic paper/scientist[1] when really we should be looking at all the available models not cherry picking the most extreme (which of course is the purpose of the IPCC reports).<p>[1] although I will say that the more conservative IPCC 2007 predictions for arctic ice sheet loss are looking pretty unlikely and the more pessimistic ones have been much closer to what has happened over the last 5 years. I&#x27;ve no idea if those dates have been revised downwards in the new report.",1380207578

Dithering certainly seems to have improved since the last version and BT.709 is used as well.

6450980,comment,6449999,6450398,3,0,RHSeeger,,,"Unit tests serve a number of different purposes (for me, YMMV):<p>1. When writing tests before the code, the tests can help you wrap your head around what the code should and should not do.<p>2. Forces distinct functionality/algorithms to be broken out into their own functions for easier testing.<p>3. Forces algorithms to be broken away from other, less testable, code (ie, read from data base, algorithm, write to database... the piece in the middle there should be in it&#x27;s own function for testing)<p>4. When refactoring, gives (more) confidence that the changes being made aren&#x27;t breaking anything. The corollary to this is it makes refactoring more common because you can feel braver about doing so.<p>5. Proves the code is doing what you say it&#x27;s doing (with the tests). Note that this doesn&#x27;t mean the code is right, just that it isn&#x27;t wrong in the ways you&#x27;re testing. Learning to write tests with good coverage and how to partition input data for that is a skill learned by experience.<p>6. Documents exactly what the code does for someone that comes along later. For much code, this can be determined by looking at the code... but in many cases the tests can say it cleaner.<p>7. Documents what the code DOESN&#x27;T do, and this is an important one that can&#x27;t really be understood by just looking at the code. If the tests don&#x27;t say the code does something, it could change later. If the tests only exercise negative number inputs but the code happens to do something useful with positive numbers... user&#x27;s shouldn&#x27;t rely on the positive number behavior.<p>8. Confirm that, when a bug is found, the fix actually fixes it. When finding a bug... a) find a way to reproduce is, b) write a test that does so and fails, c) fix the code and see the test pass... d) the bug never returns without being caught by the test.",1380205918

Get real. People reject AGW[1] because of a very well funded propaganda campaign that spreads disinformation and because the existence of AGW is incompatible with the conservative, capitalist political philosophies held by most people in the anglosphere. There are studies demonstrating the latter effect:<p><i>Why does public conflict over societal risks persist in the face of compelling and widely accessible scientific evidence? We conducted an experiment to probe two alternative answers: the Science Comprehension Thesis (SCT), which identifies defects in the publics knowledge and reasoning capacities as the source of such controversies; and the Identity-protective Cognition Thesis (ICT) which treats cultural conflict as disabling the faculties that members of the public use to make sense of decision-relevant science. In our experiment, we presented subjects with a difficult problem that turned on their ability to draw valid causal inferences from empirical data. As expected, subjects highest in Numeracy  a measure of the ability and disposition to make use of quantitative information  did substantially better than less numerate ones when the data were presented as results from a study of a new skin-rash treatment. Also as expected, subjects responses became politically polarized  and even less accurate  when the same data were presented as results from the study of a gun-control ban. But contrary to the prediction of SCT, such polarization did not abate among subjects highest in Numeracy; instead, it increased. This outcome supported ICT, which predicted that more Numerate subjects would use their quantitative-reasoning capacity selectively to conform their interpretation of the data to the result most consistent with their political outlooks.</i><p><a href=""http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2319992"" rel=""nofollow"">http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2319992</a><p>A few misguided newpaper articles that over excitedly exaggerated uncertain predictions didn&#x27;t make any difference to anything.

I just email the articles to myself and they go in a special folder and that&#x27;s where they cool off for a few days.<p>When you first start doing this, it is surprising how much some articles lose their perceived value over a few days. An article that I was really excited about when I first saw it will often induce a &quot;meh&quot; a few days later.<p>On the other hand, some articles still retain their value and appeal several days later.<p>I end up spending far fewer hours a week reading articles because of this method. It also helps to keep me focused since I don&#x27;t let my mind wander to other topics during my work day.<p>This also works for other things like movies, tv shows, facebook, etc. If you want to see the true value of something, delay enjoying it until the newness has worn off.

The statement &quot;entropy never decreases&quot; is actually a purely statistical claim, and it only rises to its usual level of essentially unbreakable validity when you&#x27;re dealing with macroscopic numbers of particles (the number 10^23 gets thrown around a lot, though it becomes an awfully compelling &quot;law&quot; even with just a few hundred particles in the mix).<p>But as for your actual example, it&#x27;s important to distinguish between <i>virtual</i> pair production and longer-lived pair production. A single photon can momentarily &quot;decay&quot; into an e-/e+ pair which then annihilates back into a photon, and in fact quantum field theory tells us that this sort of process is an intrinsic part of how photons travel through space. (Similar things happen for all other particles as well.) But conservation of energy and momentum during this process leads to weird effects like violations of the usual mass/energy/momentum relation of relativity, which is essentially why we call the e-/e+ &quot;virtual&quot; particles (or &quot;off-shell&quot;[1]).<p>For a &quot;real&quot; annihilation between an electron and a positron, you&#x27;ll always wind up with two photons in the final state (necessary to conserve momentum and energy). By the same token, to produce an e-/e+ pair you&#x27;d need two photons, not just one, and those photons would need to have enough energy to provide the mass of both particles <i>and</i> enough kinetic energy to satisfy momentum conservation. I wouldn&#x27;t invoke the 2nd law here (as I said above), but the point you&#x27;re making is still valid: because so much of the e-/e+ energy is &quot;used up&quot; in their mass, there is less &quot;phase space&quot; available (fewer possible momentum states) in that configuration than as two photons, so the probability of winding up in that state is correspondingly lower. (Also, an electron and positron are electrically attracted to each other and will naturally tend to meet up to annihilate, but two photons have no such tendency.)<p>I&#x27;m not sure that any of that was interesting or useful, but there you go.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_shell_and_off_shell"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_shell_and_off_shell</a>",1380205074

E.g. prescription co-codamol is usually sold with 30mg codeine per 500mg paracetamol vs. 8 or 12.5 mg codein in over the counter, and you can get prescriptions for &quot;neat&quot; codeine at higher doses as well.<p>And we have a drug that causes liver failure in quite small doses, to the extent that the UK government put in place restrictions on it sale intended to reduce its use in suicides (you can only buy 16 pills at a time outside of pharmacies, and 32 pills at a time in a pharmacy). It&#x27;s been widely reported to have cut suicide deaths using paracetamol by hundreds (total, not per year) since the restriction was put in place as just that slight little barrier of having to go to multiple places is apparently enough to make some people think twice.<p>So what do they do? Of course, since we all know addiction is bad (and we&#x27;re talking religious/morally/tabloid style righteous &quot;bad&quot; here), why, when they decide to allow sales of tablets with codeine over the counter, they decide it should be mixed with paracetamol or ibuprofen, with the codeine content low enough that anyone left addicted after failing to get prescriptions renewed etc. faces the choice of suffering it out, or risking their liver.<p>Cue a couple of years, and the warnings about the danger of these pills are starting to emerge: Surprise, surprise, people with severe opiate addictions are sufficiently often not in a place where you should expect them to make rational decisions about whether or not taking products containing too much paracetamol is a good idea...<p>I get migraines sometimes, and the codeine/paracetamol pills are a great help, but I can&#x27;t help but think that allowing the over-the-counter sale of them without a &quot;safe&quot; alternative for those addicted to codeine is tantamount to murder - the government knew all the risks, and in fact there&#x27;d be little reason to require those mixes over allowing plain codeine if it wasn&#x27;t as a way of making the pills more dangerous to abuse. Yet they did it anyway.",1380204880

Take the last line of the article that details a part of the report:<p><i>The draft report says the available evidence now suggests that above a certain threshold of warming, the Greenland ice sheet will almost disappear within approximately 1000 years, which will result in 7 metres of global sea-level rise. It estimates that the threshold may lie between 1 C and 4 C of warming, but is not confident of this figure.</i><p>So what they&#x27;re saying is they are not confident that some degree of warming may occur within a huge band which may do something that sounds really bad (but they don&#x27;t actually spell out the bad things) in the next 1,000 years.<p>I am a scientifically literate person with a strong conservation and environmental bent.  But when I read something like this even I roll my eyes.  Because I want people to actually conserve, please take the following advice to the AGW crowd:<p>First, stop using the disaster du jour to say, &quot;See!?!  We can expect more of this from now on!&quot;  Because when you did this with Katrina and then we had 8 years of relatively quiet hurricane seasons you sound like a &quot;sky is falling&quot; fool.  The fact that &quot;An Inconvenient Truth&quot; came out shortly after Katrina with a hurricane on the movie posters and box covers was ridiculous.<p>Second, stop making inaccurate predictions about what is going to happen.  For example - for a while everyone was decrying that snow was a thing of the past because of global warming (example:  <a href=""http://www.independent.co.uk/environment/snowfalls-are-now-just-a-thing-of-the-past-724017.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.independent.co.uk/environment/snowfalls-are-now-j...</a>)  When we then had record snowfalls throughout many areas of the world, the same people changed their tune and said, &quot;Exactly!  Global Warming will actually bring more snow!&quot;  Enough of this nonsense.<p>Stop using things like carbon credits to live a ridiculously lavish lifestyle while telling everyone else to live simply.<p>Finally, stop trying to profit off of AGW.  <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/03/business/energy-environment/03gore.html?_r=0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/03/business/energy-environmen...</a><p>There are many people that you will never convince of the reality of AGW.  But there are many more people that you are turning away from believing you because of the things above.  Because I think finite resource conservation is the right thing to do, please stop hurting this cause.",1380204717

I have some follow up questions:<p>* To quote Dijkstra, &quot;Testing shows the presence, not the absence of bugs&quot;, so presumably, you write tests to build confidence rather than to ensure &quot;that what you think the code does is what it is actually doing&quot;. Is this accurate?<p>* If so, suppose you given a code-base that contains tests. How do you determine how much confidence to place in said software?<p>* It&#x27;s very common for the space of possible inputs to be infinite, so you can&#x27;t possibly test every case. How do you decide which ones are useful to write tests for?<p>* What is your response to Rich Hickey&#x27;s depiction of, what he calls, guard-rail programming (&quot;Simple Made Easy&quot; from around 15:30 onwards)?<p>* Finally, how do know when you&#x27;ve written a good test suite? It&#x27;s obviously good if it finds bugs, but how do you know that it is good without running it?<p>Sorry to bombard you, I&#x27;m asking because I&#x27;m genuinely interested and I want write more robust software.<p>> Have you ever made changes to some parts of the code, but then worried you might have broken something? With unit tests, you can be confident that your change didn&#x27;t break any expected behavior.<p>I must say, I&#x27;ve done every permutation of changing code with/without tests where my changes have broken/have not broken things.

This past winter we were expecting a bad storm one evening.  Being a hardworker, I took home stuff to work on if I got stuck and couldn&#x27;t make it into the office.<p>Just before I got home that evening one of my tires blew.  I called the manager I was working for and explained the situation.  I was planning on getting the tire replaced first thing.  The tire shop didn&#x27;t have internet, but I had plenty of paper work that didn&#x27;t require internet, so I could work at the shop.  And of course, I would call him as soon as the tire was fixed.<p>Next morning the storm had settled over our area.  I limped to the tire store.  It took about 1.5 hours for them to replace the tire (they had to wait on delivery of the tire from their supply house).  When they had replaced it I called the manager and let him know I was en route.  Unfortunately, a couple of exits down the road a tire related emergency light came on.<p>So, I turned around and headed back to the shop.  En route I saw a <i>large</i> accident happen on the road I had just traversed.  As soon as I got to the shop, I called the manager.  I explained the current situation, and suggested that I just continue to work from the tire shop and when they were done I could work from home.<p>Long story short, this &quot;productivity focused&quot; manager insisted (i.e., I would be fired if I did otherwise) that I drive down to the office.  I ended up spending 2.5 hours stuck in winter storm traffic, so that I could sit for an hour at a desk in an office to do paperwork that I could have done at home.  Of course, I then had to turn around and drive back (thankfully that only took 2 hours).<p>So instead of 3.5 hours of productivity I got 4.5 of completely wasted drive time for 1 hour of actual work. (Then there&#x27;s the fact that if I&#x27;m on a work roll at home, I tend not to stop, so he would have likely gotten more than just the 3.5 hours of work out of me.) All because his idea of &#x27;work&#x27; is that someone in a seat in an office is productive while someone at home can&#x27;t possible be productive.<p>I&#x27;m now much more punctual about working as close to 40 hours/weekly on the dot as I possibly can (I used to average many more hours). \nI won&#x27;t do more than cursory email checks from home.  \nAnd, I don&#x27;t care how productive I am when I&#x27;m actually at the office.  \nBecause clearly all that actually matters is that I&#x27;m physically there.",1380204184

He said they already have experience of selling a company early in their careers and saw what that involves.&quot;<p><a href=""http://www.rte.ie/news/business/2013/0903/471900-stripe-launch/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rte.ie/news/business/2013/0903/471900-stripe-laun...</a> \nThe video interviews with Patrick are worth a look too.<p>Patrick is 24, his brother is even younger. I am with Stripe from the day they launched in Ireland, it was easy to choose them over the likes of Braintree and Paymill who aimed for simplicity but still required quite some formalities. Also, Paymill is Samwer brothers, a turn-off for some entrepreneurs and developers.",1380204153

6450758,comment,6450149,6450666,1,0,ashray,,,"Thanks for the detailed information. That certainly clears things up a bit.<p>I&#x27;ve been using Paypal micropayments for the past year or so and it&#x27;s been the best bet for $2 transactions (I pay 6%+$0.05 for cross border payments). Ends up being $0.17 per transaction. I haven&#x27;t come across anything that beats that by a large enough margin so as to replace Paypal yet.<p>The only downside is that Paypal is applying the standard 6% fee to $20 transactions as well (as opposed to the lower 2.9% fee), so I either need to route these transactions to a non-micropayments Paypal account or do something else with them... this is what I am currently working on solving. The difference doesn&#x27;t come out to be much for a $20 transaction but with higher transaction volume it will certainly stick out as a sore point.",1380204085

But the attention grab also works against thought, so I simply cannot daydream or think about stuff while cycling, even if I wanted to.  And I would love to.  It&#x27;s a shame really, because I love cycling.  I also love being deep in thought, which happens mostly when I&#x27;m walking, sometimes in the shower.<p>EDIT: The attention grab isn&#x27;t because of traffic.  I can ride an empty road in the middle of nowhere and the action of pedalling and looking down the road just grabs me.",1380204033

I am bringing myself to the table. ;) There's only a certain length to which I can sell myself and my idea in a public way like this without making myself look desperate, which I'm not, or lowering its value due to exposure.<p>The main message I can give is: if what I am saying and want to do resonates with you, Try Me.<p>Also, I have to be careful of people who just want to hear me out but then not do anything afterward.",1255161380
873102,comment,872759,872759,0,0,anthropocentric,,,"I wonder if you make the stairs just incrementally more interesting to use, would a lot more people use them?  That is, people have a tendency to follow other people.  So, for example, all you need is to do something that generates [initially] 10% more interest and you'll get 50% more usage (if that makes sense).",1255160808

In the scenario I envisage, the technical lead becomes the CEO assuming I do not travel to California.<p>I am looking for a high calibre team and feel that I and the idea warrants one.<p>I am sacrificing my control and equity by recruiting on HN in this manner, and I agree with you about the 'tech guy' often receiving the raw deal at times, and have actually worked as that person numerous times -- the sub-ordinate in 3 non-VC backed startups already, including a ticketing startup.<p>I am more than happy to grant more equity to other cofounders than myself: it would depend on how much input they want from me.<p>I have also been a drummer and know what it's like for musicians and managers to organize gigs and tours.",1255160275

873092,comment,872347,873044,0,0,bayareaguy,,,"Although it's clear each describes their service differently, <i>setting aside their public relations</i> it appears to me the basic service they offer is basically the same: they make it easy to setup community sites where people can post things, vote on things and accumulate karma.  Whether those things are news articles, answers to questions or other things (like reviews of silly iphone applications e.g <a href=""http://iphone.lockergnome.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://iphone.lockergnome.com/</a> ) makes little difference technically.<p>What I'd really like to know, ideally from someone who has worked with both, is if there are any particular features one or the other offers that actually do matter.<p>Or perhaps this is an example of where developing good PR is more important than focusing on features?",1255160148

873083,comment,872813,872813,0,0,azanar,,,"What I hope: the comments on this article don't become yet another conference of blowhards and apologists.<p>The frequency at which I've seen comments paraphrased as ""So you hate your work; welcome to life, now shut up and get back to it,"" is disheartening. I am surprised the number of people, even on HN, who see this mutual antagonism as not just a self-fulfilling prophecy, but one that can and will sustain itself indefinitely.<p>I honestly don't think it will. In fact, I think it already failed some time ago, and we are feeling the effects of it right now.<p>The article brings up the number of people who are, or at least feel that they are, stagnating at their current jobs. It also draws the connection between the feeling stagnation and a reduction in productivity and competitiveness. But stagnation isn't typically a temporally local phenomenon; a person does not usually become redundant or stagnant overnight. However, their realization that they are redundant or stagnating can occur overnight, often after ignoring the warning signs for as long as they consciously can.<p>But productivity isn't just affected by the feeling of stagnation and vulnerability; it is affected by the actual stagnation that an expectation of mutual loyalty causes. The worker can become lazy with the expectation that the employer will keep them on anyway, provided they aren't completely incompetent. This is a considerable threat if the worker doesn't give a damn about their work past the paycheck; what incentive do they have to be anything but as lazy as possible. They were clinging on to their jobs before, but the recession made them acutely aware that they were doing so and how tenuous their grip has now become.<p>This apathy also negatively affects productivity and competitiveness. But no one notices, because it is business as usual; at least it was. But now employers have started to notice, but they are solving the wrong problem; they assume the problem is one of insufficient data or insufficient supervision. They never assume that one or more of their underlying assumptions about their workforce, and what makes them most effective, might not be true and might never have <i>been</i> true.<p>I hope that people wake up to the larger lesson this turmoil is wanting to teach all of us. Unproductive people working in what are effectively sinecures are not a sustainable way to run an economy based on the production and distribution of wealth. Eventually, someone will ask where all this wealth is, and won't abide a waffling, noncommittal answer.",1255159646
873082,comment,872728,872838,0,0,abossy,,,"I can see his motivation for this -- I was thinking of this exact idea today. There are simply so many rudimentary questions new entrepreneurs ask that can be easily answered. Two examples that I've recently sought answers for are ""how do I negotiate for domain names,"" and ""how do I set up a credit card payments system on my website."" These are two of many, many more.<p>I've been a reader of HN since the beginning and have found it an invaluable question/answer database. All my questions have likely been answered before (I've found some really obscure stuff!).<p>Most queries can be answered by searchyc.com or a Google search prepended with ""site:news.ycombinator.com."" It'd be nice to have unfiltered access to entrepreneurial questions, ranging from the broad to the very obscure.<p>StackOverflow works beautifully, IMO, and I hope this blossoms into an excellent complement to HN.",1255159638

The point of skylon is to create a reusable single stage to orbit space plane.

That means it must be compact, readable and easily modifiable, so that you can quickly adapt and fix it, on the go.<p>So, I would choose a well-defined, <i>mostly-functional,   small</i>, simple language, with decent compiler directly to native machine code and very thin FFI, to use specialized OS services.<p>It could be a solution from <a href=""http://scheme.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scheme.com</a> or Gambit-C, not anything that begins with J.<p>So, in my opinion, a native compiler for, say, Arc to x86_64 (written in Lisp) with UNIX integration (NO Windows support) would be a better solution.

To put it plainly : the ONLY thing the president cannot do to defend the constitution is to mess with elections. That's it. It also states that the president is the person making the assessment if an action is necessary (and thus, not the courts, though of course, the president can be removed from office for making a decision that either congress or the courts think was not reasonable. That does not change the fact that the president cannot be punished for implementing that action. The maximum penalty for any crime for the president is impeachment, unless this is specifically extended by congress).\nThis is because article 2 of the constitution overrides every other law in the US, except article 1, including all following articles and amendments.\nIf you think this sequence is by accident, you should talk to a lawyer about things like this. Sequence in laws, and the principle that earlier rules override later ones is extremely well established technique of law.\nWhat everybody seems to think these laws state, that you have extensive rights without any qualifications whatsoever, is just plainly not true. If you are a danger to the application of the US constitution within US borders, the president is not bound to any standard, nor does he have to respect any form of human rights in his attempts to stop you from doing so.\nIf you think it is better in European states, think again. Specifically, read what the Dutch monarch is allowed to do (e.g. she can have someone killed - both her and the actual murderer go free, she can confiscate any amount of property - with no legal recourse for anyone, etc.).

True measures of outcomes usually can only be tracked over a long period of time, whereas outputs will give instant feedback.<p>Look at what has been happening in the schools with standardize testing. Proponents think they are measuring outcomes (effectiveness in preparing children to be skilled & productive members of society) with standardized tests. They are actually measuring outputs (test scores) as a proxy for the outcomes.<p>The result is the system being measured will adapt. Schools ""teach to the test"" which improves the outputs but we don't know the effect on the desired outcomes. It may result in children being less prepared.<p>This is a well known effect in companies that measure individual performance in terms of outputs (widgets manufactured, # of upsells, etc). The employees will deliver the required metrics but it often comes at a cost to quality and customer satisfaction which is a negative outcome to the company.<p>Which is the main lesson in quantifying outcomes: Measuring the wrong thing can be worse than not measuring at all.",1354536431

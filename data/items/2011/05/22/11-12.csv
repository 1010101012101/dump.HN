Sure.  But I never assumed it was because I was non-white, I generally thought it was because I was nerdy and small.  Once I started standing up for myself, most of the taunting came to an end.

2573091,comment,2573035,2573037,33,0,markbao,,,"I've worked rather extensively with the offline cache, and I can confidently report that the offline cache is buggy and annoying to use, especially with MobileSafari. It's not as simple as just simply downloading content and telling the browser 'when offline, serve this up.' You need to define exactly what resources you want to cache in a file called the cache manifest. The browser will download and cache the content, and subsequent accesses to the website will serve up the cached content and assets, even if you are online. To update the cache for new items, the original cache manifest file needs to be updated. However, a pretty prevalent bug sometimes occurs when you update the cache manifest file, but MobileSafari refuses to re-cache content. In this case, MobileSafari will forever serve up the cached content and never see the changes in the cache manifest file, until the user goes to their Settings and clears the cache. I'll give you one guess as to how many will do that.<p>Using the cache will automatically cache the index page by default, as it is the master file that is telling the browser to cache according to the cache manifest. Therefore, every time the browser accesses this file, it will be served from cache, even if you are online. That means that if you want dynamic content, you will have to make an ajax request to refresh the content on the index page. This proves especially frustrating if you have a lot of areas with dynamic content. And forget about doing logged in/logged out functionality.<p>Furthermore, when the cache manifest file is updated and the browser redownloads all the files, the updated files will not show in the navigator until after a refresh. So let's say you updated your index page and bumped the cache manifest to tell the browser to update the index page. It will first serve the old index page from the old cache, and then serve the new index page from the just-updated cache upon the next refresh.<p>So should the offline access store the entire history of articles? Or should it store, say, the latest accessed ones? If you just store the latest accessed issues, you would have to update the cache manifest file when a new issue has been updated, and then MobileSafari will need to re-download every single image file and asset over again. No diffs. Yuck.<p>There are a lot of compromises you need to make when building offline caching with MobileSafari using the application cache, and there is always the risk of the occasional refusal to cache which will require the user to manually clear the application cache in the settings (few will ever do that). Offline functionality is possible, but you will need to make serious concessions and work around the problems that caching currently has. Not to mention the little space given on disk for caching.<p>The way I tried to work around it, which is not foolproof but at least it's Windows XP compared to the Microsoft BOB of going all offline cache, is to use offline cache for assets (css, js, index file), use ajax to populate dynamic elements when online, and for the storage and retrieval of raw data, use the (now deprecated) Web SQL database. This is the approach Google uses for offline Gmail (screenshot for the curious: <a href=""http://winning.markbao.com/6xyM/Screen_shot_2011-05-22_at_7.54.39_AM.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://winning.markbao.com/6xyM/Screen_shot_2011-05-22_at_7....</a>).

2573082,comment,2571490,2572389,1,0,Silhouette,,,"I think you have misunderstood my examples.<p>> For border radius, if you were stung by the change, you would had to have been using the vendor prefixed version of the property<p>The rounded corners issue I talked about wasn't a mark-up issue, it was a basic rendering bug. It took several attempts to fix, over a period of months. During that time, any sites that used even simple rounded corners with an unfortunate combination of colours would get a horrible show-through effect or at best a poorly anti-aliased rendering in Chrome.<p>Rounded corners were surely one of the most anticipated CSS3 features, just the kind of thing where a rapid release cycle is supposed to move the web forward according to advocates, and they regressed it, badly, for several months.<p>Moreover, as long as Google and Mozilla keep releasing ""experimental"" CSS features with syntax and capabilities that aren't yet standardised, they are on a path where the only options are supporting alternative, non-standard functionality indefinitely or breaking existing web sites that were written using the experimental features at some unspecified point in the future. That's starting to sound like IE vs. Netscape all over again.<p>> For the video element, you might want to actually test for a bug before claiming to have been bitten by it: h264 support hasn't been removed yet.<p>Google dropped support for H.264 in the Chrome development builds some time ago, and the change is scheduled to be pushed to users of the official release imminently.<p>> Meanwhile full adblockers have existed in chrome for some time, and while tab isolation has been somewhat delayed in firefox, plugin isolation has done wonders for total crash rates.<p>If you've got a full ad-blocker for Chrome, I'd love a link. I've never found one anything close to as capable as things like Ad Block Pro in Firefox.<p>As for tab isolation in Firefox, it's not just a robustness issue, it's also a performance and potentially a security issue. One tab loading slowly or running screwed up JavaScript can still block your entire browser for several seconds, which can be very annoying.<p>> Stick to core functionality -- which I think you'll find all the vendors have done a great job at keeping from regressing -- and you'll be fine.<p>No, they haven't. I have given you four specific examples, and while you could argue that the two Chrome ones (CSS3 rounded corners and HTML5 video support for H.264) were experimental, there is no denying that the two Firefox ones (Java applets and the basic typography engine) are fundamental, well established, and seriously broken in several recent Firefox 3/4 builds. Please check my posting history from a few weeks ago for details; I gave specific citations to the last guy who seemed unable to believe it.<p>Of course, if you're going to argue that we shouldn't worry about any problems with experimental features, particularly either regressing them or cutting off support when a standardised alternative becomes available, then you're basically undermining the entire premise of this discussion, which was that rapid release cycles advance the web more quickly. As I've been saying for a while, I don't think going back to the race between IE and Netscape is going to advance the web for users in any useful way. It's just going to create a nasty, half-defined mess that most developers are going to ignore most of the time anyway, and that breaks things in user-visible ways the rest of the time.",1306063681

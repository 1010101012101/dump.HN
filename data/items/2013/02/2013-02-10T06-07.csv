5195692,comment,5195257,5195599,6,0,dscrd,,,"""Compare Rust where, unless you have explicitly used the unsafe features of the language, all pointers are guaranteed non-nil and valid. Instead of a function returning a nil pointer, it returns an `Option` type which is either `Some ptr` or `None`. The type system guarantees you have considered both possibilities so there's no such thing as a runtime null pointer dereference. Scala has a similar `Option` type, as does Haskell, calling it `Maybe`. In 2013 I don't want to still constantly check for a nil pointer, or have my program blow up at runtime if I forget.""<p>So how is nil checking different from when I write a function that pattern matches against a Maybe in a way that I only match against the ""Just"" case?",1360479529

Pipe injection is the same thing but in cases where shell commands are called with arguments taken from user input. It was very common in older Unix systems to have various bits of a complicated system actually just be the result of another standard command with proper args/input. So you find a place where something like system is used, or there is a call to sh -c , or so on, and if the input is improperly escaped, add:<p><pre><code>    |adduser ... 
</code></pre>
or change the password, or so on to get a root shell or account.<p>This has actually come back into style in certain places again, because so many devices are just linux boxes with busybox utils on constrained systems (think home routers for example a lot of those just display the output from various linux commands in their firewall stuff). But programmers don't always think about ""what if someone is going to try and do pipe on this..."" and you end up with a pipe injection.<p>It also can be used for privilege escalation if you have a lot of custom setuid stuff available for your sysadmins and someone manages to get a local account.

It is obvious to me that there needs to be some tool or library that adds these very simple log messages to these methods for me (like ""Entering method getUser(UserId=2701, SessionId='AABCF')"").<p>The tool we have at work uses runtime generated code to add these messages to methods automatically. Besides the performance hit this is fine, except for one problem. Sometimes it doesn't work; and it is impossible to figure out why. You turn on the tool, add all the right metadata, and nothing happens. You could argue that it is a tool problem, but I think one of the big things is that runtime generated code is just vastly inferior to compile time generated code.<p>If I were using go, my tool would open the code, read the interfaces, and spit out a nice implementation of logging in a .generated.go file and if it doesn't work for some reason I can actually go look at the generated code and see why.

5195599,comment,5195257,5195257,40,0,graue,,,"These points are all very true, and I admit I haven't done more with Go yet than play around. But there are a few reasons I feel I <i>don't</i> like Go, or at least, there are warts that will probably limit how much I'm going to like it.<p>Nil pointers are #1 on that list. Tony Hoare called them a ""billion dollar mistake""[1]. In Go, as in C, C++, or Java, any pointer can be `nil` (similar to `NULL`) at any point in time. You essentially always have to check; you're constantly just one pointer dereference away from blowing up the program. Since ways of solving this problem are known, I find this hard to swallow in a new language.<p>Compare Rust where, unless you have explicitly used the unsafe features of the language, all pointers are guaranteed non-nil and valid. Instead of a function returning a nil pointer, it returns an `Option` type which is either `Some ptr` or `None`. The type system guarantees you have considered both possibilities so there's no such thing as a runtime null pointer dereference. Scala has a similar `Option` type, as does Haskell, calling it `Maybe`. In 2013 I don't want to still constantly check for a nil pointer, or have my program blow up at runtime if I forget.<p>The second disappointment is that when I looked into it, it seemed there are ways to call C functions from Go code, but no working way to call Go from C code. Maybe that wasn't a goal at Google, but it seems like a missed opportunity. As a result, you can't use Go to write an Nginx module, or an audio plugin for a C/C++ host app, or a library that can be used from multiple languages.<p>I think there is a real unmet need for a higher-level, safer language you can use to write libraries. Imagine if zlib, or libpng, or the reference implementations of codecs (Vorbis, Opus, VP8) could be written in something like Go. Or spelling correction libraries. Currently we have two tiers of libraries: those written in C/C++, which can be used from any language under the sun (Python bindings, Ruby bindings, Perl bindings, PHP bindings...), and those written in high-level dynamic languages (Python, Ruby, Perl, PHP, ...) which can <i>only</i> be used by the same language. We need a middle ground. C isn't expressive or safe enough to deserve to be the lingua franca like this. And Go is tantalizingly close to replacing it, but not quite.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://qconlondon.com/london-2009/presentation/Null+References:+The+Billion+Dollar+Mistake"" rel=""nofollow"">http://qconlondon.com/london-2009/presentation/Null+Referenc...</a>",1360476345

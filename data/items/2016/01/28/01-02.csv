Charlie Stross, &quot;High Frontier Redux&quot;\n<a href=""http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2007/06/the_high_frontier_redux.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2007/06/the_high...</a><p>As Charlie points out, he makes a living fanatasising about this stuff.  But it&#x27;s hard:<p><i>Optimistic projects suggest that it should be possible, with the low cost rockets currently under development, to maintain a Lunar presence for a transportation cost of roughly $15,000 per kilogram. Some extreme projections suggest that if the cost can be cut to roughly triple the cost of fuel and oxidizer (meaning, the spacecraft concerned will be both largely reusable and very cheap) then we might even get as low as $165/kilogram to the lunar surface. At that price, sending a 100Kg astronaut to Moon Base One looks as if it ought to cost not much more than a first-class return air fare from the UK to New Zealand ... except that such a price estimate is hogwash. We primates have certain failure modes, and one of them that must not be underestimated is our tendency to irreversibly malfunction when exposed to climactic extremes of temperature, pressure, and partial pressure of oxygen. While the amount of oxygen, water, and food a human consumes per day doesn&#x27;t sound all that serious — it probably totals roughly ten kilograms, if you economize and recycle the washing-up water — the amount of parasitic weight you need to keep the monkey from blowing out is measured in tons. A Russian Orlan-M space suit (which, some would say, is better than anything NASA has come up with over the years — take heed of the pre-breathe time requirements!) weighs 112 kilograms, which pretty much puts a floor on our infrastructure requirements. An actual habitat would need to mass a whole lot more. Even at $165/kilogram, that&#x27;s going to add up to a very hefty excess baggage charge on that notional first class air fare to New Zealand — and I think the $165/kg figure is in any case highly unrealistic; even the authors of the article I cited thought $2000/kg was a bit more reasonable.</i><p><i>Whichever way you cut it, sending a single tourist to the moon is going to cost not less than $50,000 — and a more realistic figure, for a mature reusable, cheap, rocket-based lunar transport cycle is more like $1M. And that&#x27;s before you factor in the price of bringing them back ...</i>",1453946049

That&#x27;s understandable: no product reaches critical mass without a main stream. The strength of a distributed system isn&#x27;t that it has no points of failure: it&#x27;s that, in the event of a significant failure in an established node (eg. TPB&#x27;s downtime at the end of 2014), the community can retarget around a new solution (eg. KickassTorrents) at the point in which the inconvenience of the downtime outweighs the inconvenience of switching habits, without a significant dip in service associated with the switch.<p>In contrast, a truly centralized system like BitKeeper would just outright <i>block</i> progress if the central node were to deny access (which was, of course, the purpose that led to devs like Linus Torvalds changing their focus for a few months, so they they could scale back to full kernel production as they constructed a workable alternative, in Git).",1453945993

For example, our government creates a Department for Homeland Security to address threats. It employs thousands of people. What happens if the threats go away and the department is no longer needed? Suddenly thousands of people are out of a job. That&#x27;s thousands of people with an incentive to keep the department in business, which requires threats to our homeland security. Multiply this example across not just government institutions but private as well. People have an incentive to keep their gravy train running, even if it does irreparable harm. We need to remove this incentive so we can have faster iteration cycles, not just for socio-political ideas, but all ideas. Hopefully, a basic income can remove these perverse incentives by giving people a safety net.

Eventually it won&#x27;t make sense to hire 50% of the population.  A solution will be needed.<p>If housing, education, food, and energy were made super cheap through technology we could provide those services instead of a basic income.<p>Given plentiful resources what stops us from multiplying until we consume all available resources.  Perhaps, if we had basic income it should only be provided once people turn 18.  That way parents wouldn&#x27;t keep having kids in order to get more money.<p>Housing:  Looking to Buckminster Fuller.  He wanted to have houses assembled from modular components that could be shipped.  Standardization of parts would make things cheap.<p>Food: Robotics and biotechnology can increase yields and bring down costs.  Also, aquaponics is an extremely productive system.  It uses 5% of the way that traditional agriculture uses and fish consume only 1/10th the feed that cattle do.  Also, duckweed (it grows like a weed) is easy to grow and feed the fish.<p>Education: Stop with the college model already.  Technology is the answer.  Look at Coursera, Udacity, Khan Academy, etc.  For education that needs more hands on training bring back the apprenticeship model.  Let them get their education / training for free in exchange for working for free in the field for a limited time.<p>Infrastructure: Public transportation needs to be a priority.  Cars sit idle 95% of the time.  Once we have self-driving cars they should be pooled.  Just schedule a time to be picked up.<p>For basic income, we might want to only provide it for people age 18+.

10985367,comment,10982340,10982340,0,0,pnathan,,,"> decreasing the cost of living is a critical component as well.<p>Hi Sam,<p>I&#x27;m going to not read through 747+ comments, I&#x27;m sorry.<p>Right now, in the best cities in the nation, the cost of living is rising significantly. These cities have a deep job pool, they are making serious efforts on sustainability, have wide and varied culture and are generally more efficient (and often better) ways to live[0].<p>However, because of the cost of living is rising so steeply, it is forcing people of median income and below to spread out into the suburbs, increasing commute cost (and pollution), as well as the variety of issues suburbia causes for the environment and sustaininable living[1]. Among the contributing factors here is childrearing, which takes extra space - space which is extremely expensive to rent or purchase in a city. This is an incredibly significant issue as we iterate this game several times.<p>I&#x27;d like to bring to your attention several interlinked aspects that play out here:<p>- higher housing density is more sustainable<p>- highly effective transit networks decrease pollution<p>- dense housing suitable for long-term family residences is very hard to find.<p>I&#x27;m not persuaded that a start-up (a rapidly growing, high growth company) will be able to achieve success in these areas, because of the time horizon needed for these problems to be dealt with is on the 20+ year timespan. However, I&#x27;ll argue that a company could make a dent in several of these areas:<p>- mixed use high-rises that are designed for families: offices, schools, playgrounds, etc included[2]. This would be a shift from the typical luxury condo build and, I&#x27;d argue, would find a very solid niche in the modern urbanist movement. I would argue that an <i>affordability</i> policy could go hand in hand with this, with certain entities eating some of the rental/purchase cost of these properties.<p>- Increase transit effectiveness. YC is already making a play in this area with Remix[3], but I think that doubling down on making transit costs and benefits more effective could really be a game changer. Demonstrating the very real cost of commuting would assist in the people inclined towards Green thought; figuring out how to make transit a <i>pleasant</i> experience would assist in getting the people not inclined to deal with the occasional horror story to support and vote for transit.<p>- In the same vein, platforms and tools that directly support pleasant densification will help. An example of this for someone <i>in</i> a dense neighborhood is Walc[4]. But, looking at <i>policy</i> and assisting policy becomes a major political play here.<p>Ultimately, what I fear the actual solution will look like here a broad-based housing price/rent control system, where <i>everyone</i> who isn&#x27;t a multimillionaire who wants to live in a city has to be in a rent-controlled system, paid out by the local government. What we&#x27;re seeing in Seattle is a bit of a tulip situation: people buying are buying at high prices because the sellers are aware they can sell at high prices, this ratchets the next unit price up; the demand is so high that it&#x27;s forcing prices up very fast.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/19/magazine/19Urban_West-t.html?_r=0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/19/magazine/19Urban_West-t.ht...</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2016/1/26/second-life-cycle-blues"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2016/1/26/second-life-cyc...</a><p>[2] An arcology, yes. :-)<p>[3] <a href=""http://getremix.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://getremix.com/</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.walc.me/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.walc.me/</a>",1453945043

I am not in the least concerned about stigma. I am concerned about removing valuable information from the system and making it radically more difficult to figure out what is going wrong, thereby making it harder to fix the problems because we are blind to them.&quot;<p>I see what you&#x27;re getting at now. Three points:<p>1. The &#x27;basic&#x27; part of basic income is important, as it&#x27;s only meant to be enough money to cover a basic standard of living (i.e. food, shelter, etc...). If someone wants to have higher material wealth, they either have to earn it, or they have to learn how to stretch their basic income further. This process of stretching the basic income further relies on frugality and creativity, the same frugality and creativity you&#x27;re suggesting only those at the top have. I&#x27;d suggest being poor can teach you those same lessons.<p>2. Money as a source of information isn&#x27;t being lost. Again, the basic income covers the basics. Even if the market for bread and rice is stable, the market for luxury goods would be just as variable as before.<p>3. In your opinion, what is the purpose of money? In my opinion, the purpose of money is to facilitate trade. Trade can be seen as a form of collaboration. This collaboration relies on trust that what someone can produce has value. However, sometimes even when someone can produce something of value, they&#x27;re blocked from doing so due to a shortage in tokens of exchange (money). For example, when the Great Depression started, you still had the same skills in the economy as before, but fewer means to coordinate the productive use of those skills. What I&#x27;m saying is that money has value as a means of exchange, but not as a means of production. If work is an engine, then money is the lubricant. You don&#x27;t produce a more efficient engine by restricting the volume of lubricant to the smaller cogs.<p>> &quot;Alcoholics often continue to drink if it isn&#x27;t ruining them financially&quot;<p>Alcoholics often continue to drink even if it is ruining them financially.

The minute you have a UBI, anyone who only has that is de fact poor relative to others.<p>Many years ago, I saw a study that asked people in different countries to define poverty in terms of things like how many meals per day a person ate, what kind of shelter they had, etc. The study concluded that less than 0.5 percent of Americans were poor by the standards of people in India at the time the study was conducted. Meanwhile, Americans routinely conclude that 12% to 14% of us are living below the poverty level.<p>As a homeless American, I have regular access to electricity via a public library.

Only to a point. Spain is a country with over 20% unemployment. The country is full of people with college degrees who can&#x27;t get a job anywhere near their field. Given that degrees are so common, they become artificial gates: You are asked for a degree to do jobs that do not need a degree at all!<p>How do you really find a good job then? Mostly through family networking. And who has a good family network? The same kids that could afford college regardless. Many college educations are just years wasted, not unlike bad degrees in the US. No matter how many people might think about the wonders of classical educations, and how college taught them to learn, and similar drivel, in practice, those things only matter if you have opportunities handed to you anyway. For people that do not get the opportunities, college is only helpful if it helps them get the opportunities! Whether that&#x27;s through non-family networking, or because what they studied in college is something in demand in the job market.<p>When studying the effects of any policy change, we have can&#x27;t just stop at the first level: We have to see how the rest of the world will react to the primary results to the policy change. It&#x27;s a bit how student loans didn&#x27;t really make it that much easier to go to college: What they really did was make all colleges a lot more expensive, making a mistake in major and/or institution that much more dangerous. I think of a friend of mine, Ph.D in Biology with a 6 figure college debt, and no good American jobs that would take her. She&#x27;s teaching technical english in Japan, because it pays marginally better than her American options! All those years of study, all that money, to go unused, along with being saddled with terrible debt.<p>So all I am saying is, bad outcomes can happen in a whole lot of cases. Want better outcomes?

Instead, it seems that they modulate particular cell signalling pathways that regulate cell growth and survival just like other targeted cancer drugs [4]. In other words, the fact that these molecules can neutralize free radicals in vitro is irrelevant to their mechanism of action. Treating all of these diverse chemicals as one class, &quot;antioxidants&quot;, just muddies the waters.<p>In fact, there are even some cases where an &quot;antioxidant&quot; molecule selectively killed a type of cancer cell by <i>increasing</i> oxidative stress inside cells, the opposite of what you&#x27;d expect from the blanket label. For example, it was recently shown that high doses of vitamin C selectively kill a type of colorectal cancer cell, but the mechanism of action was actually that the cells take up the oxidized form of vitamin C via a sugar transporter that tends to be upregulated in cancer cells, and the vitamin C-derrived pro-oxidant caused an oxidative stress signalling cascade that led to cell death [5].<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catechin"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catechin</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthocyanin"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthocyanin</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinoid"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinoid</a><p>[4] A corollary is that, like other drugs, each of these chemicals that is effective against some type of cancer probably won&#x27;t necessarily work against other types.<p>[5] <a href=""http://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2015/11/04/science.aaa5004"" rel=""nofollow"">http://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2015/11/04/scien...</a>",1453943037

In this scenario, a user loads the page from a web server, the page instructs the user to put the device in a mode that it acts as a WiFi access point, the user then changes the access point of their machine, the page can now make AJAX requests to the device access point which is also acting as a server allowing the user to POST things like WiFi credentials for the device to use.<p>In this edge case one of two things need to happen, either the original page must be served as HTTP since no CA will issue you a cert that can be served by such a device.  Or the device must act as more than a simple API server and would have to serve HTML pages which would get linked to by the original page.

That in turn lowered his stress and things started to look less bleak.<p>Just to tell a bit of his situation: he has kids and a wife that for medical reasons as well, can&#x27;t work, so he is the sole wage earner at home. His job is very likely going to end soon, and has about 1 month runway.<p>So just in case you check back the comments, and if you are willing to take some random advice from a random guy on the Internets, why not try this? Just take a gig, very very simple one you can find through friends, your local laundromat/liquor store/etc, family, that consists of doing a simple but sleek-looking webpage or something very low hanging-fruity, and after you get your first few bucks, rinse and repeat.<p>Hopefully the boost in morale will be enough to get you to try maybe a bigger gig, etc, or at least buy you some time while you get to find another job.<p>Sorry if this is of no use to you, since I know that this route might not afford you the medical care you need and that definitely sucks. But I truly feel you and I was hoping I could chip in at least a very very minor idea in case it&#x27;s helpful in any way.<p>Not sure what else to say except to try to keep going as hard as you can, and that I can definitely lend an ear if you are so inclined (let me know and I can send you an email or something). If not, I sincerely hope things get better soon.",1453942832

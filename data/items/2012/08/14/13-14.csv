4380880,comment,4380111,4380364,2,0,slurgfest,,,"This is interesting speculation. But it is premature until you know that serif fonts are more legible - that's not something one should simply take for granted.<p>From the little I've looked into this claim, it has apparently never been demonstrated despite much trying; if there is any inherent legibility difference between serif and sans-serif fonts then it is small enough to consistently get lost in sample noise. (There may be some recent meta-analysis or something I don't know about, though)<p>Where serifs are preferred, the real reasons are cultural. Serif letters look like the ones carved into Roman monuments and the ones in all the academic journals. But there is no basic cognitive reason why we might not give that kind of prestige to runes, cuneiform, or Arabic in an alternate history.<p>I think what has to be explained is not the legibility or discriminability of serif fonts (again since I don't think that has really been demonstrated) but rather the preference for them.<p>It seems to me that many font connoisseurs and font-makers attach a lot of prestige to immersion in the traditional craft, and find less-traditional geometric constructions to be ugly (i.e.: as a cultural judgement, like finding Middle Eastern music dissonant). It happens that this geometric tendency is easier to find in sans-serif fonts.<p>Maybe this is also part of why sans-serif fonts have become so important to advertising, where there has been a premium on the new and advanced for at least a century. (And this would also add another reason for preference of serif fonts: sans-serif is associated with mass production and consumption, and the default fonts on computers; thus more subject to snobbery).",1344952436

If you can get a high clickthrough when people see the ""new"" page,  that's a big help.<p>So far as voting rings go,  it's hard for me to believe that HN isn't already strongly affected by them.  I can think of so many second rate blogs that consistently make the front page.  These aren't terrible content,  but nothing special,  and they don't deserve the level of attention they get.<p>The most obnoxious thing about HN is that when certain controversial topics come up (say there was a really provocative article on text editors) we see a surge of people writing ""me too"" blog posts and replies and then we get six or seven of those on the front page.<p>That's a hell of a lot worse than the occasional guy who spends his nights and weekends for six months developing a project who wants a little publicity on HN because he's completely shut out of TechCrunch because he's geographically challenged.",1344951894

I wanted to add that Microsoft did a lot of research on this in the 80s and 90s with the development of their Office Suite (more recently here: <a href=""http://www.microsoft.com/typography/ctfonts/wordrecognition.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.microsoft.com/typography/ctfonts/wordrecognition....</a>) . I particularly feel that startup founders need to pay attention to the <i>recognizability</i> of their logos given the word shape and neural network modeling hypotheses given in the Microsoft paper. And it's one reason why I switched my logo from being all caps (like ORACLE) to all lower case (like facebook), although cursive (like airbnb) has its advantages as well.<p>On the other hand, there's the <i>psychology</i> of serif fonts which was left out in the article (i.e. research to support that documents in serif type is viewed with more importance) and is the reasoning behind law books, legal documents and a lot of rsums written in serif type.",1344950848

Anyone that thinks farming in the US is a matter of pulling out the almanac and hoping the rain will match expectations is naive at best.<p>Here's the thought process a farmer goes through in deciding what to plant:<p>1. What's the expected market price for corn and soybean. \n2. What is the cost of crop insurance?\n3. What's the current rainfall estimate?\n4. What's the cost of water via irrigation and the cost of the irrigation equipment. \n5. What's my field rotation state?\n6. How much is fertilizer?\n7. What subsidies are in effect for the various crops?\n8. How is my cash flow?<p>And so on. The stereotype of farmers either being stupid hicks or suckling at the teat of Federal subsidies is ridiculous. The technology farmers use is amazing, and the factors they have to consider are multi-variate.<p>Sometimes farmers get screwed, and sometimes they make a fortune. Subsidies (as well as futures and other hedges) are a means of smoothing out the market so that farmers can stay in business while also providing for steady agricultural returns.

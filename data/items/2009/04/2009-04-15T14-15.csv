There is value - big value - to informal communication.<p>I suggest that all resilient systems need a bit of unscripted, unscheduled slop.<p>This applies to HR policies, customer support policies, building large physical structures ... and team interactions.",1239804406

GNUCash wasn't there yet for her -- she probably could have lived with the feature set, but the UI was making her want to break things.<p>The other problem is that she takes online classes and they tend to use packages that have very fussy browser support.  I wouldn't trust that it would work on Linux without a thorough test -- don't want to find out you have a problem during a timed test.<p>Mac was rejected on cost (she went with a sub $600 laptop).",1239804209

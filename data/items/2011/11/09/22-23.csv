The 2 example the grandfather post gave weren't great, but I think that in itself is the issue--coming up with effective emotional charged speech without using profanity is difficult, but completely possible. It takes work! And I think that is what a lot of people here are saying--cussing is cheap and lazy. And so it's offensive not because the actual words are offensive, but because the writer is clearly not putting any effort into their writing.",1320879599

I might do it in the US. Remember: it's not the <i>word</i> that's the problem it's that it makes it sound like you don't understand the social conventions of the position you're in.<p>If you're delivering a professional presentation to people you know, swear away. If you're doing it at a conference with people you don't, you appear clueless. It's the vocabulary version of turning up to a business of suits in t-shirt and shorts (or vice versa). If you're particularly powerful, you can get away with it, like Zuck does. If you're not, you can't.<p>Honestly, I'm surprised holman stuck strongly to this. It's childish, and, more importantly, it's fake. Swearing in the slides is fake. As the original blog post that pointed this out mentioned: ""fucking"" almost always has no semantic payload at all.

It's unscientific trash designed to support broad generalizations and preconceptions. The entire field is known for making stuff up in a manner that is consistent with the cultural background and expectations of the study's authors.<p>The crux of the matter is that these studies are supposed to show how certain behaviors are biologically hardwired into humans, when in fact the vast spectrum of human behavior and perception is frighteningly flexible and subject to the change of cultural and personal values over time. Many people, including pop-psy researchers, have a vested interest in showing that our behavior is preprogrammed by nature. In fact, the prescription of what's natural has been used as a justification for laws and rules for many hundred years now, so it's kind of a tradition.<p>Any study of human behavior, especially if gender roles are concerned, needs to cite specifically the cultural context and timeframe the observations were made in.

3217808,comment,3217382,3217382,47,0,nirvdrum,,,"What I'd like to see is an ounce of professionalism in most technical presentations.  I'm not easily offended by swearing, but I am offended by content.  For example, a couple years back at jQueryConf in Boston I just walked out of a talk.  In the first 10 min. the presenter had said ""fuck"" about 17 times and managed to make an MS joke. That's not Microsoft mind you, that's multiple sclerosis.  In most contexts I wouldn't have cared, but I paid $300 to attend that conference and it was pretty evident that this guy wasn't going to provide any actual content in his talk.<p>Most tech talks I've seen in the past 5 years have been terrible.  I see the presenters tweeting that they still need to do their slides while flying to the conference.  Obviously they haven't rehearsed that all and it shows in their presentation.  They read from the slides.  The code examples don't work.  They throw up pictures of lolcats and other memes to get a cheap laugh.  And occasionally they'll swear to seem edgy.  Most of this is mistaken as connecting with the audience.  It's sorta like when you watch a horror movie that just throws in a loud noise all of a sudden to startle you.  The result is that you appear scared but you can still walk away and think it was a bad movie.<p>The best talks I've seen have been practiced to the point that they seem natural.  The presenter knows his content thoroughly.  The slides are informative and all support the content of the talk.  The talk isn't a thinly veiled vendor pitch for the presenter's consultancy or company. The talk isn't also just a summary of introductory information.  There's real substance.  Whether swearing is used or not seems to have little impact on that, but in my experience the best presenters manage to deliver a compelling talk by throwing out cheap rhetoric.",1320877919

Applying to myself, let's say I make it to 4 years and am fired ""with cause"", maybe I had one too many sick days, before the fifth year. Maybe at 11 years and 10 months. That is going to be irritating.<p>But the other thing is that employees will factor it into their perception of compensation. At the end of 5 years after the payout, unless there is something new put in place, or a $10k raise, it's going to seem like a wage cut at that point. That issue needs to be considered, anticipated, and addressed.<p>Another problem is it likely knocks you into a new tax bracket that year, and possible kills off some subsidy you were getting with the new health care system so now you have to pay the full premiums, and various other similar issues, so all together it could end up being a bit less than one would get with it spread out over 5 years.<p>Rather than a $250,000 one time bonus at 25 years, which may or may not be possible since it's unlikely this is going to be set up in a trust account, it would be better to see a tax deferred, legally guaranteed pension plan set up and funded. In 25 years $250,000 is going to be a lot less than it is now, in a retirement investment account it has the opportunity to grow.<p>But, on the other hand, perhaps many people don't think in terms of retirement or taxes these days and are impressed by what seem to be large numbers and lottery payouts.

If I tore up my khakis playing neighborhood football in the back yard, my folks bought me a new pair. My Audi got destroyed bit by bit while going through pledgeship in college. And I have been through more than a couple of PC's. (I'm not proud of these habits)<p>But I noticed something odd about two items when they were sitting next to each other today on my TV stand today.

I have never felt such dedication, loyalty and responsibility for a material item in my life.<p>The feel of something in your hands is important. The way something is displayed across your computer screen is important. <i>Looks are important.</i> I don't think this is superficial to say. Many people don't realize consciously as they surf the web the underlying art involved in technology. If you are a designer of any type of course you pay attention to the subtleties of your work. But genius design appeals to everyone whether they realize WHY or not. It inspires certain emotions subconsciously, it inspires loyalty, and for me it has inspired responsibility. I have taken better care of my MacBook and Ipod Classic than my Audi Convertible or any other thing that I have owned for more than a few months. It's like the newness never wears off.

Here it is so you can read.<p>""A Letter to the Developer Community<p>Dear Mac/iOS Developer Community,<p>Empathy is the ability to put yourself in someone elses shoes who may be different from yourself and attempt to understand/have compassion towards that persons feelings, especially if their feelings are different from your own. If you do not consider yourself to be a particularly empathetic person, theres no need to read any further.<p>I attended a Mac developer conference recently and overall had a great experience. I had the opportunity to meet and get to know many great developers while learning a few things too. Unfortunately, I left with a bit of a bad taste in my mouth. This feeling I attribute to a lack of conduct standards, and a failure by many of us to understand the changes in the industry that have been occurring, like it or not, over the years.<p>Here is what happened. I sat down to listen to a talk that I could tell by the title of the talk, was going to be inappropriate. I thought to myself, Im at a respectful Mac conference, the organizer is walking around in a suit and conducting himself very professionally, Im sure it will be ok. This was, in fact, a poor assumption. The speaker prefaced his talk by basically stating there was a little substance, but that most of the topics were being presented simply because of the sexual or otherwise inappropriate jokes that could be formed from the topics. For instance, jokes that can be made about autoreleasing. Ill let you think about that for a second and you basically understand how this went. About ten minutes in, I was thoroughly disappointed in the immaturity and inappropriateness and walked out of the room. As others informed me later, it did not get any better. There were tidbits of information weaved in, but the overarching theme remained the same.<p>Sadly, this was not the only offensive point in the week. The highly respected keynote speaker managed to weave in a reference to a female celebritys tits and ass in his discussion, which I found awfully distasteful.<p>Now, I know that being one of the handful of women in attendance at the conference, I am in a serious minority in terms of the way I experience and react to things such as this. I also know that its quite possible that others would not be offended as they may have the same, in my opinion immature, sense of humor. Yet, in discussing with others, including members of my team, I found that I was not alone in finding these references uncomfortable.<p>Why is it that an inappropriate talk would even be permitted on a stage at any respectable conference? How does this in any way further the advancement of the software industry at large, and the Mac community especially? In my opinion, it sets us back quite a bit. During one of the much more informative and respectable talks of the week, the topic of diversity was brought up. The speaker pointed out the fact that the Mac community is full of mostly men from an educated and higher income background. The context was in discussion of how we tend to gravitate towards like minded people. And in fact, its impossible to argue that this is a truly diverse field by any means because women and minorities are grossly underrepresented as Im sure you know.<p>However, what this experience and other similar encounters I have had in the last three years as a Mac developer have started to suggest is, maybe the Mac community doesnt want people like me to be comfortable? Perhaps they would rather keep this a boys club forever, and its simply irritating when people like me disrupt that.<p>Wow, does that thought scare me. Coming from a different industry where diversity is praised and encouraged, could it be that software developers want the exact opposite? Clearly not all of us. But, perhaps some of the organizers of this particular conference gravitate toward that mindset.<p>The Mac development community has changed a lot over the years. There are new iOS consulting companies popping up all the time. Macs are in more homes than ever before in history. Mac developers are hiring business partners, even donning suits sometimes, and prancing into major corporations to work on exciting applications. Its a new world, folks. And as a result, there will likely be growing pains.<p>All I ask is this<p>First, if you are in a position where you can control the conduct and standards at a software event that is intended to be in any way professional, you are therefore obligated to do so. Or at least warn people who may be attending otherwise, so we may steer clear.<p>Second, before you start to defend this kind of inappropriate behavior in a professional setting, think about how you would feel if I were your daughter or your sister. Im not against inappropriate humor by any means, I just think theres a time and a place. This was not it.<p>Do we want the Mac community to be a place where anyone, regardless of gender, race, religion, etc. feels uncomfortable?<p>Diversity is great. It shows that our field is growing up. But diversity can only happen with acceptance, tolerance, and the ability to empathize with those who may feel uncomfortable, even if you yourself do not. I sincerely hope that at future Mac community events, I will not be similarly offended.<p>Thank you to the wonderful guys who provided support and feedback in preparation for this article. Its nice to know we have some gentlemen out there in the Mac community!<p>Sincerely,<p>Brit<p>Update: After getting in touch with the conference organizers, I have a lot of hope regarding this issue. They were very concerned, apologetic, and acknowledged that this should not happen at a professional event. Thank you!",1320876976

There is no way for the true owner of the site to indicate which CA they're using, so browsers are forced to trust all of them - leaving way too many points of failure. This is actually worse than your libya issue - many governments have their own CAs, making it downright trivial to make a certificate for google or something.<p>By tying authentication to DNS, there is a single point that needs to be compromised; you no longer have a choice of which CA to hack or coerce.

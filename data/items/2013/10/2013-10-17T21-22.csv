I think it shows that climate scientists have been too quick to claim the credibility of Science when their work does not measure up to that standard. (Climate science is certainly not the only field that does this: much of what passes for &quot;scientific research&quot; in the social sciences doesn&#x27;t meet the standard either.) That&#x27;s not to say we shouldn&#x27;t be trying to figure out how the climate works; it&#x27;s saying that you don&#x27;t claim the mantle of Science until you can back it up.",1382047192

So, gluing code in some brain dead fashion (wtf do I do here? Oh no better solution so I will patch this patch that with stitches) is hard because it is like brutcing. There are too many &quot;libraries&quot; and none can do everything easily. Complex system is the end result. Then engineers spend most of their time reducing the complexity. If there was a framework that could reduce in the first stage then it is easier, not harder.",1382047160

Newtonian physics was not thrown out in the paradigm shift to relativity. Our understanding of why Newtonian physics works as well as it does within its domain of validity changed; but the fact that it <i>does</i> work within its domain of validity did not change.<p>Kuhn picks a number of examples where that was <i>not</i> the case--where the old model <i>did</i> get thrown out (for example, the paradigm shift from Aristotelian physics to Galilean/Newtonian physics, and the paradigm shift from the Ptolemaic to the Copernican model of the Solar System). But he tried to apply particular features of those examples to <i>all</i> paradigm shifts, which doesn&#x27;t work.<p><i>Ideally, the new model resulting from a paradigm shift supercedes the old model while modeling the edge cases that the older model was unable to account for.</i><p>In the case of relativity, it did account for edge cases that Newtonian physics couldn&#x27;t; but it didn&#x27;t supersede Newtonian physics, as I noted above. We still use Newtonian physics where its predictions are accurate enough for our purposes, which is most of the time. It&#x27;s only in particular domains (such as GPS, to pick an example ordinary people are familiar with) that we need relativity to get accurate enough results.",1382046943

Cove 2 is one of the most popular dive sites in Puget Sound. It is right in the middle of Seattle, with a stunning view on downtown. It has shower onsite for scuba divers, it has food nearby and parking is reasonably ok for Seattle. It is also benign site which is not current sensitive, meaning you can dive it pretty much anytime (no need to wait for slack or high tide etc.)
This is a default place for a lot of people to take some of their classes. All the locations where octos usually hide are pretty well known to divers here.<p>Dylan lives somewhere pretty far from that dive site and there are a lot of other places where he could have harvested an octo. Instead of doing so, he chose a most popular dive site around, place well known for people coming to look at octopuses, came there during the day and killed one of the creatures. When somewhat exasperated divers ask him &quot;Dude, WTF?&quot; he told them that he was in his right and suggested to mind their own business.<p>Imagine a park somewhere, where it is well known that deer come and interact with people. There is a family playing with a nice baby deer here and then a hunter shows up, walks right to the deer, who is not afraid of people and cuts bambi&#x27;s throat, right in front of the family. Yes, he is within his right to do it, but he behaved like a dick.<p>That&#x27;s what started a shitstorm, not a desire to stop harvest of Octos. There is a lot of them in Puget Sound and they are not in any danger and divers know this. Just don&#x27;t be a jackass and butcher a Bambi in a petting zoo.",1382046585

6568358,comment,6566915,6568180,6,0,hsitz,,,"I also think the linked article was somewhat strange.  Or maybe just linkbaity.  The title can be paraphrased as &quot;To an alarming degree, science is not self-correcting.&quot;  However, the article actually describes the way science is supposed to work, which is self-correcting.<p>The main criticism in the article seems to be that, in much of current scientific practice, the self-correction doesn&#x27;t happen immediately.  Well, it would be helpful to know: (1) how does current state of self-correction compare to different times in the past, 50 years ago, 100 years ago, 200 years ago?, (2) what happens over the long term to papers that aren&#x27;t refuted immediately but which later turn out to be obviously wrong? do they hang around and have a negative impact on progress of science?  I&#x27;m sure there are more questions.<p>Another strangeness in the article: The article begins by touting a concern over a 1998 &quot;priming&quot; study.  In the third paragraph, the article states that there have been nine (9!) subsequent studies that have failed to replicate the 1998 study&#x27;s result.  Is that not an example of the scientific self-correction working quite well?  The article complains, &quot;Either the original research is flawed (as the replicators claim) or the replications are (as many of the original researchers on priming contend). Either way, something is awry.&quot;  Yes, something is awry.  But it&#x27;s hard to see how it&#x27;s the scientific method/process itself, which seems to be doing exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to: calling the 1998 paper into question.  (Is the main concern here just that more bad or questionable science is being published than in the past?  I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s true, but there are also many more studies being published in this era and it seems not surprising that overall quality would decline.)<p>Like some others at HN, I get concerned when I see pieces like this that the science-haters will latch on to and use to discredit the scientific method itself.  The article itself _should not_ be taken that way, by anyone who understands science.  But there are many who don&#x27;t understand science, who are anti-science, etc.",1382046453

In its current state, with its current sales, of course not.&quot;</i><p>I&#x27;m not so sure those things follow. There is a tremendous amount of baggage/inertia in existing car companies, no where was that more apparent than seeing GM convulse when it was bought out by the US government. Could I beat Usain Bolt in the 100 yd dash? Hell No! If you tied his shoelaces together? Damn straight I could!<p>Tesla has no other cars, no other obligations, no other legacies, no other technical debt to pull backwards on it. One of the most interesting things I read was a car analyst comparing Tesla to Fisker. Fisker built an electric car with the best batteries they could find. Tesla didn&#x27;t build an electric car until they had built batteries that met the requirements of an electric vehicle.<p>The difference there is profound. Prior to Tesla there were no batteries in the world that could be bought which would let you build a Model S. Car companies weren&#x27;t telling battery makers how to make batteries, and battery makers weren&#x27;t telling car makers how to make cars. But Tesla sat down as a company and designed an electric car from whole cloth, from the AC induction motors to the battery chemistry. That is an insanely stupid thing to do, it has huge risk. But they pulled it off.<p>From a <i>thinking</i> perspective, Tesla should be bigger than GM and Fiat combined. Compare the Volt or the EV-1 (which is unfair since technology has advanced so far since then) to the original Tesla Roadster. One company is thinking, one company is designing. I think thinking wins in this case.",1382046403

6568256,comment,6567189,6567189,6,0,onepost51515,,,"Heh. A rant, if I may:<p>I lived in a small town in northern Canada until I was 17. I had had an interest in programming since I was 11, but the job most relevant to &quot;computers&quot; you could get up there was repairing them at BestBuy. My parents weren&#x27;t particularly rich, and didn&#x27;t encourage me to strive for high academics or anything of the sort; in fact, the only thing they really wanted me to do was to get a driver&#x27;s license, so I could have a fallback job as a truck driver. I hadn&#x27;t a single role-model for the &quot;white-collar dream&quot; I found myself pulled into from playing with Linux and reading Slashdot. I just knew I couldn&#x27;t manage it living where I did.<p>At 17, I finished high-school and, with virtually no separation, moved to a more reasonably-large city (Vancouver) and began taking courses at a community college. I believed, at the time, that taking my first two years at a &quot;cheaper&quot; school would be good for my future student-loan-debt load, and optimized for this instead of, say, networking opportunities. The community college was full of unmotivated students just trying to squeak by, teachers who knew less about CS than I had learned from the Internet, and in the end, I didn&#x27;t feel motivated enough to make the grades to manage a transfer into the CS program of the &quot;state&quot; university (UBC.) My student loans cut off, and I dropped out.<p>I started attempting to do software-dev contracting. (It&#x27;s very hard to get full-time employment as a developer without a Bachelor&#x27;s, whether or not you&#x27;re an autodidact with 8+ years&#x27; experience in some technologies.) I moved from one gig to another, never really finding that fabled &quot;word of mouth&quot; that would let me lever one contracting job into another. I always worked alone, and remotely; I was never hired onto a team. I looked on eLance a lot.<p>I still haven&#x27;t made, in all this time (I&#x27;m 23 now), a single &quot;programmer friend&quot; who would qualify as a connection, nor met a programmer in person from whom I&#x27;ve learned a single fact, rule, or concept I wasn&#x27;t already familiar with, or been introduced to any neat new technology. This isn&#x27;t bragging about my talents--rather, just painting a picture of the bottom-of-the-barrel places I&#x27;ve been hanging out. I&#x27;m sure I would feel out-of-my-depth (in the best way) sitting in any arbitrary coffee shop in Silicon Valley, or in any even-somewhat-modern startup here or elsewhere.<p>If you want to talk about lacking connections, first imagine the closest thing to a &quot;programmer&quot; in your Facebook friends list being your friend from high-school who does accounting at an oil-and-gas firm. Imagine everyone in your family saying that the one time you got paid $50k was &quot;a fluke and won&#x27;t happen again; you should just work at a gas station like your mom and your aunt do&quot; (leaving alone the fact that you don&#x27;t have enough customer-service experience to be considered for that job in a competitive market.) Imagine having no major portfolio pieces you can show off, despite years of coding, because you&#x27;ve alternated between struggling to survive on a total dry-up of income with no savings (no time for side-projects), and doing programming jobs for capricious clients who take your backend system and give up on the idea before hiring a front-end guy, relegating your efforts to only be examinable through API calls and doodles of wireframes. (And while you&#x27;re at it, imagine having a few friends in the US, who have perfectly good job opportunities available for you with their companies, but who can&#x27;t help you out until you go back and finish school--which you can&#x27;t, at least yet, afford to do.)<p>But there is that app I made two years ago that I still have in closed beta, the browser-based-collaboration-environment one with an active community even when I don&#x27;t check in on it for weeks at a time. No time to remodel it into something good enough to launch to the public... but it lets me call myself a startup founder nevertheless. I&#x27;m just in stealth-mode, that&#x27;s it. Heh.<p>---<p> Having undiagnosed ADHD may have had something to do with that as well. I imagine, having detected and compensated for that flaw, I would be quite better at slogging through that remedial-feeling workload if I had to do the same now.<p> I&#x27;d love to move there, actually... if I had American citizenship.

The reason is simple: you have to convincingly show that your failure to show a result is not just due to your mistakes.<p>Here is an analogy to a trivial situation. Which is more convincing?<p>Positive result: By following the steps in the documentation, I installed MS Word on my computer. Therefore, MS Word can be installed on my computer.<p>Negative result: I followed the steps in the documentation, but MS Word still doesn&#x27;t work on my computer. Therefore, MS Word cannot be installed on my computer.<p>If you&#x27;re like me, you barely pause after reading the positive result, but the negative one brings to mind piles of questions: did you have the right version for your OS? Do you have enough disk space? Does your computer work properly in other respects? A really tricky problem could take ages to figure out. At some point it&#x27;s probably going to seem wiser just to abandon the problem, and get a different computer or a different program.<p>So, as a scientist, when you&#x27;re faced with a negative result, you know you have a battle ahead of you. If you don&#x27;t think anyone will care very much about your result, moving on to the next project may seem to be the right choice.

Its possible for the ransomware app to verify payment and unlock itself, with no contact or control from the ransomware author, greatly reducing the author&#x27;s risk. Actually, its easier for the victim too - rather than wiring funds to some bank account in far off lands, a quick anonymous digital payment instead. Im speculating but its possible for the app to query blockchain.info for a deposit for a given address, or (less likely) for the app to download the blockchain itself, and then unlock after a certain balance. If there is high confidence that the data will actually get unlocked, that swings the balance of fight the app or pay the app towards the pay the app side.

Now, it&#x27;s trivial to wipe an OS and restore from a backup. The real value is the things people store on a computer, which are usually going to be accessible via a user account.<p>One trivial solution would be OS level automatic versioning of files (ala Dropbox or Sparkleshare) - the original files would be written to location that is read only to the user and only accessible via the OS, hence, backups could always be restored from it, but never destroyed without admin rights.<p>Of course, with people having great internet and whatnot, an automatic cloud based solution would be much more likely and useful.<p>I think with Windows 8.1 and onwards, Microsoft are automatically doing this by setting up the &quot;Documents&quot; type folders in SkyDrive - a great think moving forward.<p>Backups are, obviously, a much better solution but require extra storage and usually cost money.<p>So there might be a niche for a freeware product that runs as an admin that automatically versions files - perhaps even as simple as having an admin-owned .git repo for the Documents folder.<p>The worrying thing about this attack is that targeting user data is trivial on all OSs, because of the way we think about privileges - it could be done to us Linux users through something nasty in our shell rc using GPG or whatever.

Not intended to be rude (but perhaps pointed).<p>I suppose I get concerned when I see forces applying moral judgment to investment techniques and timescales (as distinct from companies actions, where I think it&#x27;s easier to judge - e.g. not wanting to invest in tobacco, for example).<p>The long term investor is not <i>necessarily</i> more moral than the short term investor, though he may be. But part of the long-term investor&#x27;s confidence in his investment emerges from the fact that he can exit his investment if he judges that long term trends make it less valuable to hold it.<p>That liquidity is, in large part, created by the churn of short-term speculators operating in the zero-sum game of the short term. Spare no tears for the short term-speculators - they operate in a tough game, and the ones who actually thrive and stay around for the long haul do provide a valuable service - reduced trading costs, narrowed bid-ask spreads, and faster order execution as a commodity.<p>Similarly, products such as ETFs (held by millions of small investors and 401(k) accounts) owe their existence to the ability to rapidly rebalance portfolios in response to changing prices of the underlying products that the ETFs are trying to replicate. Prohibiting rapid trading eliminates the possibility of the various affordable products that track indexes, commodities, sectors, and so forth.",1382043948

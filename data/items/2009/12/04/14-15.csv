Single-airport cities in my not-pluralizable-to-data experience have more problems with rental car shortages, weather, and traffic.<p>Perhaps it's just a question of number of airports per population and/or land area.

976339,comment,975773,976018,0,0,gvb,,,"Eliminating the stack frame is a pretty effective speed optimization for ""traditional"" languages.<p>It costs a non-trivial amount of instructions (execution time) and cache space (potentially casting out more useful data - data fetch time) to build an unneeded stack frame, and then a couple more instructions to throw the frame away.  Even for processors that have a ""build a stack frame"" instruction like the x86, the instruction is a pretty expensive one in terms of clocks required to execute.<p>With a ""traditional"" language, stack frames can be eliminated in the leaf nodes of the calling trees.  These routines tend to be the very small utility routines so building an unneeded stack frame to execute a three line (often only a handful of assy instructions) routine is measurably wasteful.<p>Thus, I would add a third type of code that benefits from stack frame optimization: small leaf node functions, i.e. functions don't call anything <i>other</i> function.",1259935628

API providers can require registration to the contest, then monitor the usage metrics based on API keys. This would give an indication of how much development is happening before the contest deadline. If it's not much, <i>extend</i> the deadline, but don't cancel it. As far as quality of the submissions, it's not reasonable to expect polished, production quality work. The goal should be creative or novel prototypes that demonstrate a use case of the API. To me, a good entry would be one that clearly shows how the API is being utilized. Finally, if you've got good prizes(check),\n an iteresting API to play with(check), and a site to support the API(check), and you can't attract developers, you're doing something very wrong or not trying very hard.",1259935501

I know that when I've worked with design firms we have always tossed around a bunch of ideas before talking to the firm, and often just see what they come up with without our own ideas interfering.  You're also dealing with a team at Faberge, not just one person...ideas percolate throughout the group beyond the people you're meeting with and once an idea takes hold there is no pulling it back.<p>What's so bad about charging for pitch work, if you're sensitive to this?

I find the built-in ""help"" stuff in vi deeply frustrating, because I can't navigate until I learn its navigation commands, and it gives me no way to learn the navigation commands other than by navigating around inside the help system.  I'll try again with your suggested reference(s).<p>With regards this last point though, I don't seem to have expressed myself clearly.  My point is that the material covered in this ""cheatsheet"" page is very, very basic stuff, and if you use vi more than an hour a day then you'll no longer need the cheatsheet within 72 hours. There's little point in having a cheatsheet on the utter basics.  Much better to have a cheatsheet on the next level, covering things you only use occasionally, and hence might not remember.<p>In short, I think we agree.",1233439044
460124,comment,457499,457633,0,0,helveticaman,,,"> Because literature's fascinating?<p>Yes, that's a good reason to get a literature major.  But if you paid in blood to go to a top-tier school that doesn't seem all that much better at teaching literature than a lot of other reasonably good schools, and are paying huge sums to do it, <i>and</i> expect excellent job prospects, then you may be making a mistake.  Sounds like this isn't your case.  But I get the impression this is pretty common.<p>What shocks me is meeting people who seem intensely focused on the rat race and appear to want to take on the world, but then get into Yale or whatever and decide to study something that is not exactly conductive to world domination.  Then they complain.  This...makes my brain hurt.  I totally respect your choice regarding <i>Finnegans Wake</i> and the billion dollars.  But surely the philistine who preferred the billion would not be better off with the English major.  And surely he has no right to be surprised when he has trouble getting jobs as good as those of his engineering peers.",1233439030

By spending $650 billion we can make up that difference in output with the help of Keynesian multipliers.<p>I certainly sympathize with the parent. For the last three months I canvassed for Greenpeace pushing a reinvestment in renewable energy. One gentleman whose door I knocked on was skeptical (way more than just this one guy, door-to-door canvassing amidst recession is a great job if you enjoy getting kicked in the nuggets 100 times/day). He speculated the green movement was just another attempt to sell a newly packaged bubble to the American people.<p>So are we foolish to pursue this short-term fix? Is the reinvestment plan fairly characterized as a short-term fix?<p>To the first question I can at least express the hope that this investment will leave us with something inherently useful: much needed improvements to our infrastructure. We've been riding the wave of cheap energy from the petrochemical revolution for the last 100 years (thanks Steve Jobs Playboy article) and that is certainly appearing to mainstream America as a habit to kick.<p>To the second question, maybe it will help to explore the long term consequences of not meeting our productive capacity. By analogy we can consider the consequences of not meeting our capacity to educate. Imagine if America lost an entire year of engineering graduates. A short fall in capacity may result in a long-term compounded drop in overall engineering output.",1233438748

Building codes evolve, which also defeats standardized construction.<p>The new Freedom Tower (One of the World Trade Center replacements; a symbolic 1776 feet high), a hyper-iconic building, is lately estimated to cost around $1,000/sqft of floor area to construct. Simpler skyscrapers can cost as little as $200/sqft, so that's your competition. Your proposed venture needs to be able to 1) complete skyscraper projects at substantially less than $200/sqft, 2) meet building codes, and 3) convince authorities to grant construction permits for a radical construction technology.<p>Skyscraper construction, like house construction, is already automated to a great degree.

The problem is that the robots need to be small (enough to be transportable and reusable), cheap (cheaper than construction workers) and mobile (small => you need many to slowly build up the building). Most robots don't have that level of sophistication yet. All the manufacturing robots are stationary and (relatively) large, and mobility is something of an unsolved problem.<p>This is not to say that it is impossible, just that I think there are significant engineering hurdles to robots building skyscrapers (maybe smaller houses first?).",1233436613

ES6 seems to be making JS more &quot;Python&quot;, while &quot;strong mode&quot; makes it more like Java/C# (at least to me). I&#x27;m open to worthwhile changes; I&#x27;m just thinking about the tens of thousands of lines of JS I&#x27;ve written with various utilities and libraries, and how they will eventually fit into ES6...I&#x27;m not too sure about strong mode, though.

9189138,comment,9188160,9189111,0,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"> Yes, security issues are found in Java and every other language, but when these are patched all programs that use that language are patched against the issue. The attack surface is much smaller.<p>All patches work like that; when there is a bug in libssl and OpenSSL patches it then all the programs using libssl are patched. The difference with Java is that when a C library has a bug only programs using that library are exposed but when Java has a bug all Java programs are exposed. Moreover, Java itself is <i>huge</i>. It&#x27;s an enormous attack surface. Your argument would hold more weight if the &quot;much smaller&quot; attack surface actually produced a scarcity of vulnerabilities.",1426132620

9189134,comment,9187123,9187123,0,0,hackuser,,,"Resubmitting my critique of the Times from a month ago (I hope this isn&#x27;t frowned upon at HN):<p>--------<p>I read the NYT daily (via RSS feeds). It is an important institution for the U.S. and the world; the options are rapidly shrinking for high-quality journalism and so I worry about the Times&#x27; future. From my perspective the Times&#x27; content is invaluable, but in 2015 the Times is hurting itself because it still hasn&#x27;t embraced the web. www.nytimes.com is still a newspaper&#x27;s website, not a news website. When I&#x27;m looking for news in my browser, I don&#x27;t care that you have a paper edition, I only care which website serves me best.<p>--------<p>1) Design: Look at the homepage. If someone was asked to design a new news (not a newspaper) website, who would design it like that? Rather than a news website it looks like a newspaper on the web, seemingly trying to mimic the layout of a newspaper&#x27;s pages. (It&#x27;s not just the Times -- often it&#x27;s easy to identify news websites with a newspaper legacy.) From the perspective of people familiar with the Times on paper, it might seem familiar; but get outside that bubble and it&#x27;s archaic and a bit bizarre.[1]<p>Also, it hides so much content; why put all that talent and effort into work product that you show only to a few? My NYT RSS feeds look like a different, far richer publication than <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/</a>. Again, it seems like attachment to the legacy newspaper design, where people can&#x27;t easily pick up another publication and so will flip through Times&#x27; pages and sections looking for something interesting. The overall structure is a newspaper&#x27;s sections forced into a website&#x27;s medium.<p>--------<p>2) Multimedia is still secondary: Articles still are primarily text, but now more often with video and image bolted on almost as decoration, and not an integral part of the content, equal to the text. See today&#x27;s article on Tomi Ungerer[2], chosen at random. This is about a visual artist, and it actually has several images within the text, rather than on top or in a pop-out, but the images are merely decorative. The author doesn&#x27;t write, &#x27;look at this drawing; see the use of color, the ironic shapes, etc.&#x27; and look at this detail <img: zoomed-in detail> where Mr. Ungerer uses X to do Y&#x27; It&#x27;s almost as if the the author wrote the article and someone else picked some relevant decorations later.<p>There&#x27;s even a link in prime real estate, just beneath the banner, to &quot;Video&quot;, as if I choose my news based on whether it&#x27;s in text or video. As if you are saying, &#x27;our actual news is below, and video is something we do over here&#x27;. I just want the news; I trust you to choose the best mix of mediums to communicate that particular story.<p>The solution is well known: Most amateur bloggers are equally fluent in text and multimedia; rather than describing something they write &#x27;look at this&#x27; or &#x27;here&#x27;s what happened&#x27; or &#x27;here is the before and after&#x27; and, in the middle of their post place a video, image, or short loop as appropriate. Hundreds of millions of phone users fluently communicate with images and photos. But the talented, professional communicators at the Times stick primarily to text, I suppose because that&#x27;s what they did on paper.<p>I&#x27;m not looking for graphic excitement; they are just communication tools and sometimes multimedia is the right tool, sometimes text is; the Times seems to choose its tools based on paper&#x27;s limitations (i.e., text is cheap, images expensive in both space and $, video impossible) and not what communicates best on the web (where all are cheap and space is unlimited).<p>---------<p>3) Updates and the news cycle: Two things I still see in the Times: A) &#x27;Updated at 4:55pm&#x27;. If I read the article at 3:00pm, that isn&#x27;t very helpful; should I re-read the entire thing and try to figure out what changed? Run a diff? Again, the solutions are well known and most bloggers handle this situation effectively; the Times still seems to be designing newspaper articles that will be published and read once. B) When you do have someone blogging a breaking news story, sometimes I&#x27;ll see &#x27;That&#x27;s it for tonight, I&#x27;ll be back at 8am tomorrow&#x27;. I don&#x27;t have to explain the problems with that, though I&#x27;ll add that the news and your readers are in time zones worldwide.<p>---------<p>[1] This will be shocking to say but I&#x27;m trying to make a point about how far the Times is, conceptually, from the web medium: Consider the most recognized branding element, the detailed, archaic font used for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, in the banner. In the days of newspapers, when readers could only type in Courier if at all, the font was special. It said, &#x27;this was printed professionally, with skill and seriousness&#x27;. Now kids can print fonts like that on their school papers, anyone can do it on their WordPress blog, and when they do it&#x27;s frowned upon. Now that element says, &#x27;not a digital native, stuck in our glorious past&#x27;. Again, it&#x27;s hard to imagine a newly created news website making that design decision. You may have a strong attachment to that design element, but billions of web users don&#x27;t care. (I know branding is difficult to change; I expect the font will remain.)<p>[2] <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/13/arts/design/review-tomi-un.."" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/13/arts/design/review-tomi-un...</a>.",1426132541

Great question, this is why we&#x27;ll be focused on newly diagnosed glioblastoma patients. If they do recur and have a surgery to remove the recurrent (and hypothetically mutated) tumor, we would test that tissue as well and compare its drug response profile as well as any biomarker changes.<p>We&#x27;ll also be using in vivo xenografts to try to model mutations/regrowths, by continuously observing treated mice to see if we get a regrowth. The mice have faster metabolisms than humans so tumors can sometimes regrow faster in them than in patients.<p>If we have a regrowth in a mouse, we could then culture that tumor in vitro for a screen to develop a plan to treat a patient&#x27;s recurrence before it occurs. This has been proven out already as a strategy by another company using xenografts, Champions Oncology.<p>2. Since this LDT regulation change is still in motion we are observing it very closely.

Chromebook is zero-hassle. It&#x27;s great that Dell is putting native Ubuntu on their laptops, but fundamentally those are still machines that were designed for Windows first and awkwardly adapted to Linux. They&#x27;ll always have a few niggling issues that a designed-for-ChromeOS machine won&#x27;t have.<p>2. I prefer ChromeOS to Linux. The ultra-minimalist ChromeOS UI is just amazingly clean and elegant, in a way that none of the Linux desktops are (and I say that as a huge fan of GNOME 3).<p>3. The high-DPI version of the XPS 13 is more expensive than the Pixel (and might not be the one that gets released with Linux, they haven&#x27;t announced it); high-DPI is a mandatory thing on an expensive laptop now for me.<p>4. 3:2 screen is the perfect aspect ratio, and the XPS isn&#x27;t that.<p>5. USB-C charger is sweet.<p>But the XPS 13 looks like it&#x27;ll be a nice laptop when the Linux version comes out.

There are simply way, way more ways to shoot yourself in the foot.<p>The trouble is that everything is a trade off. It&#x27;s very hard to get a buffer overrun in Java but that doesn&#x27;t make Java a good language. It tries so hard to keep you from hanging yourself that it won&#x27;t let you have any rope, so in the instances when you actually need rope you&#x27;re forced to create your own and hang yourself with that.<p>For example, you&#x27;re presented with garbage collection and then encouraged to ignore object lifetime. There are no destructors to clean up when an object goes out of scope. But when it does you still have to cleanup open files or write records to the database or notify network peers etc. Which leaves you to have to manage it manually and out of order, leading to bugs and race conditions.<p>In other words, C and C++ encourage you to write simple dangerous bugs while Java encourages you to write complicated dangerous bugs.<p>That isn&#x27;t to say that some languages don&#x27;t have advantages over others, but rather that the differences aren&#x27;t scalar. And code quality is by far more important than the choice of language. BIND would still be less secure than djbdns even if it was written in Java.",1426131638

But I don&#x27;t like gratuitously locking things down in a way that makes highly dynamically-typed code harder to write, where it doesn&#x27;t seem to solve a real unavoidable performance problem: for example, the ban on constructors leaking &#x27;this&#x27;, and the oddly specific recursion limitations.  In general, the document seems to express the sentiment that only statically typed code matters, which I think is short-sighted.  I also dislike, among other performance-unrelated changes, the &quot;let&#x27;s fix C&quot; syntax bits, such as banning fallthrough, which is just likely to annoy programmers familiar with C (who are used to writing code that relies on it on occasion).<p>However, making nonexistent property accesses silently return undefined is just an amazing way to ensure typos in property names never get caught.  I don&#x27;t think `foo.bar || baz` is much to sacrifice - Python, for example, has getattr(foo, &#x27;bar&#x27;, baz), which works fine, and has the benefit of returning foo.bar if it exists at all, not just if it&#x27;s a truthy value.",1426131600

We are testing both cancer and non-cancer drugs.<p>1. We agree, the reason we are using cell culture is because it is very fast and allows us to test many combinations at once. We have improved standard cell culture conditions and continue to do so to mimic the patient&#x27;s brain as much as possible.<p>We confirm our results using in vivo mouse models where we have injected a patient&#x27;s brain tumor cells into the mouse&#x27;s brain.<p>2. Another great question, we prioritize the results based on safety first, then efficacy.  Since these are exclusively approved therapies there is existing software that can predict toxicity interactions. We will also have a group of pharmacists that will validate the safety of the combinations.<p>3. This was one of the first hurdles we encountered after we started the company. The drugs we are testing are mostly off-patent generic drugs that are cheap for patients to buy directly without reimbursement from their insurance company.<p>If it is a more expensive drug, we can help the patient and their doctor appeal to get reimbursement on the rationale that the standard of care for grade 4 brain cancer is ineffective.<p>We will be starting a feasibility clinical trial as soon as we can for the purpose of publishing data on the safety and feasibility of this approach.",1426131129

      // the final args start off as a clone of the default args
      let args = Object.clone(defaults);

      // we then loop through the keys and copy in any overrides

If your JS is compact and otherwise well-formed, you can probably afford the compiler hit sometimes, knowing that code is a lot easier to write.",1426129996

One thing about the actual test that kicked it up a notch over practice tests (aside from the pressure of it being for real) was that you could not bring scratch paper to the real test. There was a fair bit of empty space in the test booklet so you had room for truth tables, graphs, and such, but if you botched one and had to start over you might find scratch space tight.<p>I aced analytic reasoning. Shortly after the test, I saw a magazine at the supermarket full of those kinds of problems. The shelf position and the ads in the magazine indicated it was aimed at older women. I bought it, because I enjoyed that part of the test so much, but didn&#x27;t have much hope because I <i>aced</i> that part of the LSAT! How are puzzles for <i>Grannies</i> going to be a challenge?

Obviously x% of these disputes (with 0 <= x <= 100) are disputes that the customer should have won, but the merchant did because the dispute process is not flawless.<p>> So what is it? No more work (and I just have to fill in a form) or more work?<p>Typically it is no more work. I have experience from almost filing a dispute on my Wells Fargo credit card against Sprint. I didn&#x27;t end up filing it because Sprint sent me a refund at the last second. Wells Fargo&#x27;s online dispute forms do ask for some evidence: such as a log of email exchanges, shipping tracking numbers, etc. That&#x27;s how I know. Obviously the process varies between credit card issuers. And I am sure no evidence is required when it is clear the merchant is at fault (a phone call will do). But either way this is similar to the complexity of the process of submitting a complaint with the FTC, where it can be as simple as a phone call if verbal info is all you are willing to provide to them.<p>> Also you realize the BBB is a private company that has no teeth right?<p>The BBB is quite effective: &quot;The overall settlement rate for all complaints filed by consumers in 2014 reached a record high of 91 percent&quot; <a href=""http://www.bbb.org/charlotte/news-events/bbb-in-the-news/2015/01/bbb-releases-year-end-2014-report-inquiries-increase-by-34-percent-complaints-decline-by-three-percent/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bbb.org/charlotte/news-events/bbb-in-the-news/201...</a> Why do you imply they are ineffective?<p>> I see bitcoin people recommend small claims court all the time. It works great when the merchant it local. It doesn&#x27;t work so well when the merchant isn&#x27;t since you have to file in their county. So add on travel time, missed work, etc to travel to where ever they are(assuming they are in your country) and it becomes a lot less likely someone is going to go this route.<p>I agree, but don&#x27;t lie by saying &quot;it also requires that the company screw up repeatedly&quot;.<p>> This was a big company and if you read the correspondences they were more than happy to ignore the people until a 3rd party stepped in. This works great on rare occasions but bitpay isn&#x27;t going to be able to afford to police transactions with their fees.<p>You imply TigerDirect was intentionally dishonest, but it is very obvious the incorrect refund amount ($14.99 instead of $167.21) was a glitch, a bug. No matter how you want to believe it, this story doesn&#x27;t show that merchants are dishonest and evil when they take bitcoins and they know there are no chargebacks. Are you claiming some evil TigerDirect employee typed in $14.99 intentionally on his terminal to try to rip off the customer?<p>> I&#x27;ll also note you skipped over the miner disputes in your response.<p>I didn&#x27;t reply because this is not relevant: most customers who paid the manufacturers with credit cards could not dispute the charges either, because of the 60-day limit after which chargebacks are not allowed. So I am not sure what is your point... Whether you paid the manufacturer with a credit card or in bitcoins, all customers are out of their money regardless.<p>Also, you too skipped over many of my points:<p>- &quot;But I am not claiming a legal action is as likely as a chargeback to make the customer whole. I am claiming a legal action works just as well as a chargeback to put pressure on merchants to keep them honest.&quot;<p>- &quot;But I will repeat for the third time: this is not the only thing that incentivize merchants. FTC, BBB, legal actions, etc.&quot;<p>- &quot;As I said, most merchants are trying to please customers, so most mistakes are resolved without a chargeback. I don&#x27;t think you will disagree here&quot;<p>- &quot;So yeah for the 1% of cases where you think the merchant might be fraudulent use Bitcoin with escrow, or a credit card, or cash-on-delivery, or whatever. For the other 99% a standard non-escrowed Bitcoin transaction is acceptable.&quot;<p>Your non-reply means you agree with these points?",1426129498

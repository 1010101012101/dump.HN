3595257,comment,3593662,3595010,1,0,nate_meurer,,,"McDonalds received 700 complaints out of <i>10 billion</i> cups of coffee served.  There will always be some number of people complaining regardless of the temperature, just like there will always be people foolish enough to put said coffee between their legs and fiddle with the lid.  How many people do you suppose complained that their coffee is served too cool?  If you say none I'm tempted to call you naive.<p>McDonalds coffee was not ""40 degrees hotter"" than other establishments.  This came from her attorney during the trial and it's laughably false.  Out of thin air it seems, he invented the axiom that coffee should never be served hotter than 60 deg C.  McDonalds' corporate policy was, and still is, to serve coffee at around 80 C.<p>My coffee maker brews at 95-100 C.  Your's does too.  At all other times, your coffee maker maintains a temp of at least 85 C.  Guess who else does this?  Fucking everybody.  The National Coffee Association recommends coffee be served at around 80 C.  Starbucks, Daz Bog, Peaberry all serve coffee at or around... you guessed it: 80 C.  Tell you what, go to a Starbucks and see what kind of reaction you get when you tell them they should lower the temperature of their coffee to help keep you safe.  Remind them that you just might be stupid enough to squeeze the cup between your legs.<p>Stella Liebeck put a cup of hot coffee between her legs, and acted surprised that 1.) it spilled, and 2.) it burned.  The arguments at trial were a textbook example of farce.  Her lawyer monkeyed around about exactly how many seconds it takes for coffee at various temperatures to cause a burn.  All the while dancing around the unspoken notion that Stella Liebeck did some kind of mental calculation based on some assumption of the temperature of McDonalds coffee, and rationally concluded that putting it between her legs was unlikely to cause pain or injury if it spilled.<p>Trying to argue your point using a picture of her legs is nothing more than an appeal to emotion.  Yes, that burn looks bad.  Yes, it's too bad she chose to put a cup of hot coffee between her legs in order to fiddle with the top.<p>How about this: I'll show you a picture of my daughter's friend after she accidentally stabbed herself in the eye with a paring knife, and then you can politely agree that the knife maker should be sued for negligence.",1329328449

Consider a class Foo implementing method foo, and a class Bar implementing a method of the same name foo. When I am renaming Foo.foo to Foo.bar, a refactoring tool will rename based on the semantics.<p>Renaming manually will always require looking through all occurrences, compared to clicking a couple of buttons in Eclipse and being assured it renamed all occurrences without any false positives or negatives.<p>Also, the nature of dynamic languages make it harder to refactor:<p><pre><code>    class Foo:
        def foo():
            pass

    class Bar:
        def foo():
            pass

    def a_func(arg):
        arg.foo()
</code></pre>
Now, in arg.foo, arg can be an instance of Foo, or Bar, or Baz...In a large codebase, manually doing it will be a night mare.<p>I mostly use vim, linux and dynamic languages. But that doesn't change the fact that Eclipse/Java is leaps and bounds ahead when we are talking re-factoring.<p>Also, I use rope for Python. Though it mitigates most of the warts, it can't mitigate the issue in the snippet above. There is an `unsure` mode which renames when unsure, but that's not a smart thing to do on a large codebase.",1329328066

""Though almost every scholar agrees that the earth (though flat) is the center of the universe, some people do persist in saying that the earth is not only in orbit around the sun, but is also round.  Most of these minority claims rely on ""mathematics"" and other potentially incorrect ""proofs"" of their theorems.""<p>I am reminded of the ""paradigm shift"" approach to the history of science, as flawed as it may be to some (look it up, sigh, on wikipedia).   It implies that the dominant point of view is held as fact until a preponderance of evidence shifts the minority view from ""flawed"" to ""edge cases"" to ""the new paradigm"".  Then it cycles again.  What was the sworn truth with history behind it is now the ""old paradigm"" and disregarded.<p>For wikipedia, I've never felt there to be a requirement for  ""article completeness"", just an eye to be ""well rounded"", and so it often feels that whatever the dominant paradigm is  currently will be the primary driver of inclusion and presence in an article.<p>Wikipedia is in that interesting tension between sticking to it's original mission, which was pretty wonderful, and potentially becoming more, but at the risk of becoming useless.

Because they're vetted. Why is that important? Because primary sources can be taken out of context, because people can't parse them out correctly, etc.<p>I would submit that both of those things are no longer safe assumptions.<p>Secondary sources can be fabricated whole-cloth and appear legitimate (entire industries, such as some branches of SEO, do exactly this) when they are not, and can even cite Wikipedia themselves. So, secondary sources aren't these bastions of truth that they seem to be.<p>The idea that primary sources aren't usable to the populace is also old. It's trivial these days for a user (who cares even the tiniest amount) to run a search and contextualize a source. If Crazy Eddie's Account of the Haymarket Riot is, after a fast search, the only one that has Xenu interfering then maybe it's not a credible account, yeah?<p>Moreover, having so many eyes seeing the same citations and clicking through them increases the likelihood that somebody who actually does have expertise in the matter can comment usefully.<p>If you can't trust the great unwashed masses to search out the truth of things given primary sources, why do you think giving them prechewed knowledge is any better?",1329325999

Anon editors are often treated like dirt; people making 15,000 twinkle edits feel as if they should have some extra power or consideration.  And there's a bunch of meta stuff which is, frankly, toxic and probably doing a lot of harm.",1329325268

Too many of these new ToDo lists create a sort of productivity anxiety, shouting in your face ToDo items which are not completable yet, or not feasibly completable today.<p>I haven't found an app which decently replicates Things' Today view, where ToDo items you said you'd do Today appear, and if you can't do them, you just click ""Not Today"" and they'll come back tomorrow (or you can schedule them if you have a better date idea).<p>I'm now in the Things Cloud Sync beta, and can't talk about it due to an NDA, but cloud sync for Things is coming, and it'll be great when it arrives.",1329325212

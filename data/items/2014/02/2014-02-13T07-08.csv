I told myself I&#x27;d never vote for them with my wallet again.<p>On of the issues I remember at the time was their refusal to have Sun releasing JVM updates for Apple&#x27;s platform, while simultaneously not keeping it up to date themselves.

There are a huge, absolutely huge number of YC startups that get acquired for less than that. Many of those are acquihires ($<1MM-5MM) where the founders make probably as much as they would if they had taken a corporate job, except they now have the invaluable experience and credibility of having founded a company; others are small acquisitions where the founders still make a profit ($5MM-40MM).<p>rdl is suggesting you pick <i>top</i> startups that are <i>post Series B</i> and which already have <i>multi-hundred-million to billion</i> dollar valuations (think: Stripe, Pinterest, Airbnb). He is not suggesting you join a 5 person YC startup that is still trying to get product market fit.

Hurts your right ear after a while\n- It gets warm, resulting in side-head sweat\n- If you are looking in someone&#x27;s direction as you are looking at the screen it creates this almost soul-less void in your eyes, making you look dead.\n- Voice recognition at least for British accents isn&#x27;t great so far, but it&#x27;s not bad",1392277458

Beyond the core algorithms and data structures whose mastery should be kinda obligatory if you want to implement anything in production, it is impossible for a novice to tell what he should ingrain in his daily work and what he should not.<p>The advice given here is therefore is very good. Get practical experience in building things, so you identify the beneficial abstractions when you learn of them, and have courage abandon those that do not provide value.<p>The downside is the &quot;expert beginner&quot; who learns a one way to do a thing and thinks it&#x27;s well and good to do it that way for all eternity. Higher level languages are fantastic because they offer efficient and practical abstractions out of the box for the &quot;patterns&quot; you would implement yourself in a half-assed way in a lower level language like c.<p>People infatuated with solutions finding a problem are kinda bad from a communication point of view. They are so a plenty that when one tries to offer practical higher level solutions to existing problems the listener often thinks this is motivated out of love for the solution and not out of love for the problem.",1392276523

But this kind of deal is exactly why some companies feel like protecting their &quot;intellectual property&quot; with patents. Because the distribution networks are not open, except for the web and even if your execution is perfect, there&#x27;s no guarantee you&#x27;ll be the first to market, because shit like this happens. And then we&#x27;ve got people praising app stores, because their grandma can now feel safe, though to me optimizing for grandmas doesn&#x27;t make much sense.<p>I view the app store model as a regression. It is useful, but only when it&#x27;s optional. Android is still allowing installs from third-party sources, even though you have to click a checkbox to enable the capability, but due to current trends and seeing Android&#x27;s evolution, I don&#x27;t have many hopes for this feature surviving in the long run.

Laws are more guidelines than a strictly enforced system.<p>> While that is certainly true, in cases where a suspect is not found with such paraphernalia and they&#x27;re especially noisome or talkative, you have other amusing tools at your disposal such as &quot;resisting arrest.&quot; A skilled DA could contort those into drug charges, I&#x27;m sure, but my point was that it can take very little to wind up behind bars if you&#x27;re in the wrong neighborhood, the wrong color, dressed the wrong way, or simply seen as a belligerent public nuisance.<p>I am fortunate to live in a place (Denmark) where the justice system does not take the punitive approach I regularly read about in the US.

I agree that these limitations, being primarily enforced via community standards, are a more gentle way of handling the issue than a legal solution. As for reddit, you can still have good programming-related discussions in specific languages sub-reddits, but I don&#x27;t know if r/programming has ever been good.

I like that.<p>I&#x27;m currently keeping my eyes on both Julia and Rust and regularly try to do things in Haskell and Clojure, but basically every time I start a new non-trivial project in a new language I often end up at a point where I&#x27;m facing a language problem not a problem domain problem.  How do I deploy language X on platform Y and make it talk to application Z, why is there no library to read/write .foo files,  how to I make these two incomplete, buggy, almost-but-not-quite-overlapping libraries I found on github play together.<p>And don&#x27;t get me wrong, that can be a fun challenge in its own way, but I don&#x27;t always have time or desire to take 2 weeks out of what was really supposed to be a 2 week project to write a library to do something that would take me 2 minutes using a stable well tested python library.<p>I don&#x27;t know, maybe it&#x27;s just me getting old, but these days I&#x27;d much rather spend my time solving problems using programming than solve programming problems, doubly so when people are paying me to solve problems.",1392274874

If you spend a few weeks hacking on a few key low-level routines, that might enable you to write the rest of the code in python and use some library you really want. In turn, that might enable you to release many more innovations faster than you would otherwise, and create something awesome.<p>But it&#x27;s hard to remember all of that when you&#x27;re in the middle of writing some C code so that it can be optimized with vectorized instructions when targeting newer chips.<p>Hacking is great, but engineering can inspire and enable hacking. How many of these cool startups would be around without gnu/linux/freebsd?<p>I think the trick is to go to a higher level once a day, or spend more time at a higher level once a week. What is value you will deliver to at least one other person? Are you making real progress getting there; or are you building an endless series of platforms on top of each other without ever having a clear application in mind?<p>Even if you are working on a generic performance improvement you can still do that. If 10,000 servers are running your software, and you improve performance by 2.5%, then you can measure the value you delivered in terms of power saved per year and it would be a real accomplishment. That will be motivational, and it will also help you choose a better follow-up project to deliver even more.",1392274866

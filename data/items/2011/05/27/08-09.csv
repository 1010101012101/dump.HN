If follows from the prerequisites for that case. If you don't agree with those prerequisites, you choose the other case.<p>The good of the people, the government, and the politicians/cronies brokering the deal are all unrelated. Almost always the insiders profit, often the government (this party, not that - or this system, not that) does, but only rarely does this percolate down to the people.<p>>> So now you've defended Exxon from being the charge of thievery.\n> Since they're not guilty of thievery (in this case), why are you offended by them being defended from the charge?<p>They are guilty though. If I buy a TV from someone's home-care nurse, knowing the nurse doesn't have their patient's consent to sell it, I'd be a thief. Legally and more importantly, ethically.<p>If (the hypothetical) Exxon knew this $300M value was far below an honest evaluation or that the sale was achieved by kickbacks they'd know the public didn't actually consent, and thus they couldn't legitimately take ownership. But hypothetically they did, and it's theft.<p>> We're assuming that govt officials have the relevant authority. If they exercise it poorly ....<p>What a dumb idea that is. What precedent have you ever seen for that?<p>Seriously, a vote isn't a sign-off on anything a government does, it's a last-ditch effort to keep things from going really badly. Nobody I know has ever given consent to be governed, including abdicating their right to chose a better political system first. I know people who have changed their citizenship and who theoretically have agreed to the rules of their new country, but only because there were no other ways to have some say in the government that was already taxing them and claiming to act in their name.<p>Assuming anything, let alone something as monumental as a mandate to rule, from such minor and infrequent actions, is ridiculous.<p>Remember, if you buy a stolen TV it's not yours, and if you knew or should have known that it's stolen, you're a thief too.

By this hypothesis, the temporal distance between any two adjacent events, that is, the 'amount of time' separating then, is exactly equal.  If there is no substrate upon which time is measured, then you cannot say the temporal displacement between e0 and e1 is anything but identical to that between e4 and e5.  For that matter, the delay between e1M and e2M precisely equals that between e10M and e11M.  This seems utterly bizarre. (edit: corrected grossly mistaken arithmetic, thanks atakan)<p>By this hypothesis (assuming I'm understanding correctly), there is a ""Planck length"" of time, which is simply the separation between any adjacent events.  It would be meaningless to speak of anything smaller, as there is no substrate upon which to measure the distance between them.  It is simply 1.  What can it mean to describe a time between two subsequent events but that there is a third between them?<p>This whole thing is bloody strange, and yet oddly intuitive.

As is obvious to almost anyone, only free access is worth offering because the micropayment problem means you can't collect any worthwhile payment for the service. A town could offer throttled wifi along a main street for a hundred dollars a block - an amount too small to break up among the thousands of visitors over the next years, and this tiny expense could easily pay off in tourist dollars captured, etc.<p>The telcos want to retain their captive market (the townspeople and tourists) and want barriers on sharing to do so. Remember, every cookie you bake and share with friends is theft-of-potential-service from a local bakery!<p>As for competition, no. That's clearly wrong. Everyone agrees that the waste from multiple sets of roads would be too much and the state maintains a monopoly on roads, etc - delegating this (toll roads) but never letting go of it.<p>Some things are natural monopolies. While maintenance of a sewer may be contracted out you don't see many parallel competing sewer systems. It'd be a waste.

Basing anything on a few obviously horribly twisted examples is wrong.<p>And lastly, don't conflate state ownership with state regulation.

This will also happen if you write your messaging system in C++.<p>There are two solutions to this problem:\n- flow control, where you tell producers to back off \n- paging to disk, where you flush data from memory when it is on the disk<p>Neither of these is trivial to implement which is why there is a big gap between toy messaging systems and serious products.<p>As others point out on this page, RabbitMQ has support for both these features.

This isn't the stuff you learn about in the news because, sadly, to many people living in those conditions, it's part of life.\n- Simply not have any positive role models at all to look up to. Their role-models are their parents, or their neighbors who have basically grown accustomed to living in poverty and can offer no guidance.<p>And I can go on and on.<p>My girlfriend and I have simply concluded: ""some of these people don't know any better.""  If they had better role-models, they'd have a better shot.<p>So it is about the network in a way, but the author doesn't go enough to explain why. I'd like to give it a shot based on my observations: the network effect matters. Escaping one network to join a knowledgeable and competitive one exposes you to different ways of thinking, makes you question preconceived notions you have, makes you realize just how badly things really were, etc.  I'm sure others here can relate even more, but coming from a modest background, it has been truly eye opening to be in the bay area, for example. There are so many talented, ambitious young people that inspire you every day to push your selves to the limits, that question your abilities, etc.  Most people, I must say are unfortunate to not even know what YC is, entrepreneurship is all about, etc.<p>So for anyone who doesn't really understand poverty (I myself, included), I really recommend you visit a third-world country and actually live amidst them. Find a friend who comes from such a background and go stay with his/her family and him/her. You'll realize just how fortunate you are.  By all means, don't feel bad about this, just gain some conscious about the fact that there are less fortunate people out there and begin to question what you can do with your companies, at your job to educate these people.<p>To finish, for anyone that questions a university's worth... remember this, an education isn't just the material you learn during lectures or books, it's what you learn about others and from others that really , also.  And this latter component, I think is the secret to reducing poverty: simple exposure to new ways of life.",1306484343

I don't want to waste too much time giving praise in the interviews but rather I want to dig into the problem solving involved with these applications with regard to design/development/funding etc.<p>I don't use Designmoo's graphic resources but I do browse the website for inspiration (of which there is a lot). I know Rich Hemsley, co-founder, from Twitter and I made him aware that I don't fully support the idea of supplying designers with pre-made graphics.<p>As Community Director of DesignersCouch.org my role is to help nurture emerging designers as well as support seasoned professionals. The idea of a designer using a pre-made menu, for example, is somewhat contentious in my opinion. On the flip side I can see good reasons for using pre-made graphics such as a resource for developers who aren't strong designers. Also where do you draw the line for pre-made graphics? I myself have paid for icons or have used Photoshop/Fireworks patterns/brushes.<p>Regardless, I respect anyone that turns an idea into a working business model and I'm genuinely intrigued in the Designmoo/365psd journey.<p>I'm also intrigued on the impact of hitting the Apple Appstore main page. Zootool released an iPhone app recently and Apple staff picked it as a 'New and Noteworthy' app. Alfred App is in the top 100 free apps for Mac. So definitely want to ask about scaling/demand.<p>If you have any insightful questions that you'd like answered then please post below or email me (hello inspiredbeta.com).

I&#x27;m not bashing GNU/Linux (or any other OS) here - I use it and it&#x27;s a good system. My only point is, that designing protocols (as opposed to designing apps/services) doesn&#x27;t really help to get rid of inconsistencies and bring compatibility. Sometimes, yes, I bet having a well-defined protocol saved many from inventing their own. But - in my personal perceptions (and I surely could be wrong) - not even remotely enough.<p>3) They&#x27;re not <i>hard</i>, just <i>inconvenient</i> to some degree. Given enough time and patience, everything can be worked around (and there are compatibility wrappers/hacks). But - honestly - it&#x27;s still a mess, both on the surface and under the hood.

10268535,comment,10266103,10268203,0,0,_delirium,,,"SEP articles are definitely better-structured, especially the ones on general overview subjects. I think that&#x27;s a general property of the respective authoring models. Wikipedia is good at specific articles on well-defined subjects, while the general overview articles often range from incomplete to haphazard. An encyclopedia written by individual expert authors is better at crafting long overviews, which often require subjective and carefully curated synthesis of material.<p>But I use them both, for different things. The general overview articles are much better at SEP than Wikipedia. But Wikipedia has a lot more narrow articles, on subjects that SEP doesn&#x27;t cover at all, or mentions only in passing in one paragraph of an article. For example, a huge number of short-to-medium-length biographies of historically important philosophers (SEP instead has a small number of quite lengthy biographies).<p>I do wish something like SEP existed in more other fields.

(Yes, really, 4chan can do &quot;heartwarming&quot; on occasion.)  And much of the best content gets saved in screenshots, files, and wikis, and re-posted later.  (Its transient nature has as much to do with its culture as its anonymity.)<p>For one of many examples, the tabletop gaming board /tg/ has quite an impressive array of content.  People develop campaigns and settings there, run games on the board, design games, produce interesting original writing, post stories of gaming adventures, and otherwise produce an astonishing amount of original content.  You can go there if you run a game and you&#x27;re looking for material or inspiration, or if you just want to laugh at a pile of nerdy jokes and enjoy some interesting stories.  And note that /tg/ is considered a &quot;safe for work&quot; board, and the moderators do enforce that.<p>Also see the TED talk from Christopher Poole (&quot;moot&quot;), which mentions several more interesting stories.<p>4chan does have a large amount of &quot;background radiation&quot; to ignore, and portions of its culture can be quite toxic.  It&#x27;s not in any way a curated collection of content.  But parts of it can be awe-inspiring, useful, and fun.",1443044881

It&#x27;s a common talking point to mention &quot;cow farts&quot; and &quot;cow burps&quot; because they emit greenhouse gasses. But generally the greenhouse gasses emitted by cows are from the organic matter that they were fed.<p>Excluding the farm equipment and fossil-fuel-based fertilizer, cow burps form a natural closed loop. Meaning, grow corn or grass and it takes in greenhouse gasses from the soil and the air. Feed it to a cow and it releases those same greenhouse gasses.<p>Cows and plants by themselves are not actually contributing greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere in a manner that contributes to global warming. Meaning, if you&#x27;re worried about cow burps or humans breathing... stop worrying about it. And if you&#x27;re pointing out that animals emit greenhouse gasses... cool, but that is irrelevant to a rational discussion of emissions that lead to climate change.<p>For agriculture, the system becomes imbalanced when you add in the emissions of the industrial farm equipment and the shipping infrastructure to getting food from the farm to the the table. But that imbalance is what we&#x27;re trying to address when we talk about transitioning to more fuel efficient vehicles or more sustainable farming practices (like not using fossil fuels in fertilizer).<p>So, mentioning agriculture as a polluter is typically a red herring. At first blush it seems reasonable because there are a lot of farm animals that emit greenhouse gasses. However, including agriculture in a discussion of emissions is usually disingenuous or misinformed.",1443044363

This enables you to use Pebble as an actual watch<p>I&#x27;m not sure why the &quot;always-on&quot; aspect is an advantage. The Apple Watch display turns on when I raise my wrist to look at it. Always-on seems more like a vanity feature than actually useful. If you aren&#x27;t looking at it, it serves no purpose to be on.<p>The battery life has never been a problem for me. I put the watch on it&#x27;s charger when I get in bed, and take it off when I wake up. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever hit < 40% battery at the end of the day.<p>> Apple&#x27;s strategy of building an expensive toy.<p>I don&#x27;t believe that is the intention at all. I think Apple is trying to create a truly useful device, with a much broader scope than Pebble. Personally, the Apple Watch has been very useful for me. I would be very unhappy if I had to give it up. My Apple Watch watch feels significantly more utilitarian than my phone.<p>I also think you&#x27;re underselling the fitness aspect. I&#x27;ve been much more active since I got my Apple Watch. The importance of physical activity is hard to understate.<p>Also, I visited my doctor recently and she was a bit worried that my pulse was high. I showed her the graph of my pulse over the last week, and she was no longer worried. In the future, when we can measure thinks like blood pressure and blood glucose, it will significantly improve people&#x27;s health. That&#x27;s clearly where Apple is headed.<p>I love Pebble as a company and I think they make a really great product. However, it&#x27;s wrong to say the Apple Watch is nothing more than a toy. It&#x27;s already had a decent impact on my life, and I think that impact will be exponentially larger in a few short years.",1443044149

In neural networks there are a lot of algorithms that really hard to compare and generalize. To make your idea possible I see two ways for that. First one is to change architecture for the main models classes in popular library. In practice for the popular libraries it&#x27;s a huge amount of work. Even if you found possibility to generalize core architecture with other network that you want implement, probably, you will broke a big part of library that works before. The second one is build a new folder inside of existing library that contains localized code that don&#x27;t have relation to the core part. How it differs from the decision of a single repository for a different library? In practice its a good way to separate something without relation, because further attempts to combine all in a big library will lead to breakage and bugs that are difficult to debug and fix.",1443043909

I don&#x27;t necessarily seek <i>happiness</i> â€” I would rather have demanding work that positively impacts the world over some job that allows me to surf online all day.<p>What&#x27;s funny is that I procrastinate <i>only</i> with regard to intellectual activities â€” not physical ones.  Getting myself to exercise is no trouble at all.  But prodding myself to finish a VPTree implementation... that&#x27;s much more difficult.  My hypothesis is that I procrastinate on those things that I was naturally good at during childhood.  Academically, I was decently above average (well, at least up until college), so I never had to study.  I always completed homework at the last second before it was due, and I crammed most of my test studying into the night before the exam and then promptly forgot the material as soon as I walked out of the classroom (as I&#x27;m sure many of you have noticed, this &quot;strategy&quot; doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well in college, and it fails dramatically in grad school).<p>On the other hand, when it came to sports, it was pretty much a guarantee that (at least initially) I would naturally be the worst out of everyone participating.  I was determined to improve though, so I developed training schedules and religiously followed them until I got the results I wanted.  I think that habit has stuck with me, and I still have no trouble starting an exercise regimen.",1443043781

If you run lean you increase your mileage, but you run hot which can increase your NOx output by two-digit factors.<p>I scanned the literature real quick, and it&#x27;s pretty mixed.  I think stuff before the ULSD switchover pretty clearly favored the biodiesel, because No.1/No.2 were nasty.  After the switchover, with a properly tuned engine, it seems to be pretty close with the ULSD having perhaps a slight edge.  Without retuning the ULSD seems to be somewhat better.  However all of this varies pretty broadly - some people found <i>improved</i> NOx levels just from switching biodiesel.  I didn&#x27;t find a good, modern paper that quantifies the increase, a few looked promising but were paywalled.<p><a href=""http://umexpert.um.edu.my/file/publication/00003184_92278.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://umexpert.um.edu.my/file/publication/00003184_92278.pd...</a><p>I thought this was a good summary of the effects of biodiesel and tuning strategies on various engines.  Like ethanol vs gasoline, biodiesel contains more oxygen than its fossil counterpart.  It&#x27;s also not as fully saturated.  As such it just tends to run leaner and hotter, and that&#x27;s why there&#x27;s a change in average levels.  There seems to be a huge variance in the data.  Some possible explanations: every manufacturer tunes their engine a little differently, air conditions like humidity and altitude may play a part, and the composition of the biodiesel may not be constant (eg percentage of fossil mixed in, level of saturation in the feedstock, different additive mixtures, etc).<p>I think manufacturers probably tune their engines primarily for fossil, and to improve mileage they tend to run them as lean as emissions standards will let them get away with.  So they may be fairly sensitive to small changes.  It would probably be best to add biodiesel to the emissions tests as well, to get them to pay some attention to tuning for it.  Maybe there&#x27;s a happy medium that will work acceptably with both.  If not - flex-fuel ethanol vehicles are capable of automatically detecting the level of ethanol and adjusting their tuning to match, we should have something like that for biodiesel.  Perhaps a property like acidity or density, levels of particulates, or presence of a taggant in the fuel.<p>Anyway, hadn&#x27;t looked at that stuff since before ULSD was out and didn&#x27;t realize it had changed the picture a little bit.  I don&#x27;t mean to minimize the problem, acid rain sucks and we should absolutely do what we can to address it.  But there&#x27;s no zero-harm solution, if the increase can be mitigated or kept minor with proper tuning there are some compelling benefits to biodiesel over fossil diesel.",1443043698

To make them useful, the tokens might be, say, SHAs of files they are considered licenses to.<p>The files themselves don&#x27;t have to be attached to the system anywhere; in fact, the files don&#x27;t even have to be available from the IP owners. Holding such a token effectively says &quot;I, the IP owner, promise not to sue you for having a copy of this file on your hard drive.&quot;<p>All the files themselves could be available on BitTorrent or whatever elseâ€”the tokens might-as-well-be scrips to participate in decriminalized piracy, much as doctor&#x27;s notes allow one to participate in decriminalized marijuana consumption. But you <i>can</i> imagine an ecosystem of clients (or maybe OS-level features) that can collate licenses to IP-holder CDNs to get those files, maybe transmitting a zero-knowledge proof of the possession of the license to the CDN server in exchange for the file; and will remove shell-level access to the file when the license is removed from the store. (The file could be retained in an OS-protected cache and such in case the user regains a license to it; it just has to be made inaccessible to the user.)<p>Now, consider the current products and services that a complete implementation of this sort of system would displace: any App Store (Apple&#x27;s) or Game Store (e.g. Steam), any Music or Video store, potentially most streaming services, etc. A proper implementation would make &quot;having content available to access&quot; just an OS-built-in transparent side-effect of having the proper licenses. Tons and tons of middle-men would be put out.<p>So, imagine building this thing in any way that&#x27;s even slightly centralized. Imagine, just as a slight step away from a blockchain, that this was a Ripple/Stellar type thing: a set of ledgers extended such that each ledger account can hold a bag of bitstrings, rather than a bag of {currency_code, amount} pairs.<p>Wouldn&#x27;t it be in this service&#x27;s interest to gain adoption by partnering with these IP middle-men? They&#x27;d say &quot;let&#x27;s get Valve to make it so that people&#x27;s Steam games are listed in here, and then people can just move the licenses around using our wallet app! Win-win!&quot;<p>The potential partners, afraid of being displaced and commoditized, would go along, but at the same time, try to take control of the system. They would want the technology provider to allow them to impose business restrictions on how and when users could transfer things, or even charge a cost payable to the partner for doing so.<p>The result wouldn&#x27;t be a distributed zero-trust ledger of IP licenses at all; it&#x27;d just be a meta-store interface, with each store able to enforce its own policies on its licenses.<p>Now, you <i>could</i> posit that there&#x27;s some perfect organization (maybe the FSF? GNU Taler is a thing) that wouldn&#x27;t fall for these tricks, even as its network absolutely fails to gain traction because nobody wants to be displaced by it.<p>But it&#x27;s much easier to just solve the problem by not having an organization running the network at all, so that there&#x27;s &quot;nobody there&quot; to decide to partner with the IP owners or the current middle-men. Take the decision away; turn off the incentive structure. Just make it a blockchain.<p>(The other convenient thing about such a structure being a blockchain, though, is the scaling story. A company like Stellar builds out a network and then has to pay to run its network until people start to join and peer with it and overwhelm the seed nodes; if Stellar were to run out of runway at any point, it would almost certainly be at the start, the costs of maintaining the seed network draining them dry before adoption picks up. A completely distributed ledger is initially run by idealist hobbyists, who will continue to run it without charging it rent each month until such a time as the system gains popularity enough to comprise commercially-run nodes as well. It&#x27;s like parents taking care of their kids for free; it lets the network grow up until it&#x27;s ready to support itself.)<p>---<p>...now, all that being said, yes, you can eliminate the &quot;blockchain&quot; part of this if you flip the problem on its head. If instead of the representation of ownership being the computed ledger account holder of a given token, the tokens themselves are self-describing documents that are signed and re-signed by each party as the token changes handsâ€”then you can store these tokens anywhere: put them in a DHT, stick them in your OS&#x27;s keychain store, wherever. People can just carry one to another computer via Sneakernet if they like.<p>This quickly gets into problems with verifying that a license hasn&#x27;t since been moved or revoked, though, which starts to look like an &quot;ask the IP holder if it still wants you to be holding its license&quot; sort of problemâ€”like CA revocation is today. In fact, the whole system in that case would look like the current infrastructure for code-signingâ€”and that&#x27;s a problem, because that sort of system privileges IP owners (who can run CRL servers) at the expense of consumers (who can&#x27;t or won&#x27;t), making the whole thing just turn back into trusting the IP owner to say who currently owns a thing, and getting the IP owner to perform license transfers on your behalf, and all the rent-extracting problems that those two things generate.<p>With a blockchain, everybody is up-to-date on who currently owns that thing. You don&#x27;t have to think about key revocations or expiries; you don&#x27;t have to worry about stale grants; each machine just computes current ownership after every new block, and if something is now gone from your account, all your devices know it (or know that they&#x27;re offline and can&#x27;t trust their database of ownership assertions.)<p>But, <i>if</i> you have a system for broadcasting those self-describing documentsâ€”something that where everybody will be able to synchronize with it and then receive timely updates from it (Usenet, maybe?)â€”then yes, you get the same properties as a blockchain. But you&#x27;ve also just effectively <i>recreated</i> a blockchain. (And while you&#x27;re recreating a blockchain, you might want that &quot;proof-of-work&quot; thing in there, too, so that people can&#x27;t flood your newsgroup-ledger with pointless messages.)",1443043348

Moderating a large subreddit on reddit is infinitely harder and more complex than 4chan. Some of the larger subreddits see more pageviews than the entirety of 4chan.<p>Moving beyond that, moderators on 4chan are completely anonymous unless they choose to be known. This isn&#x27;t the case with reddit. Moderators often have to have a long and tenured account history or else they don&#x27;t really have a shot at being added onto a mod team in the first place. Very few subreddits, and no large ones, will add someone to their team without a history.<p>This is important because with a history, you open yourself up to attacks. If you do something unpopular, you <i>will</i> get witch-hunted by reddit&#x27;s masses. I speak from personal experience. People will call your house, your loved ones, send pizzas or worse. You&#x27;re literally walking on eggshells 24/7, 365 days of the year. And then even if you do everything right, if someone has it out for you, it doesn&#x27;t matter. They&#x27;ll still figure out who you are and harass you. It&#x27;s an added dynamic that just doesn&#x27;t exist with moderation on 4chan.<p>Moderating a large subreddit on reddit (a large default, like /r/Pics, /r/Funny, /r/Worldnews, etc) is probably the toughest moderating job on the internet right now. And what makes it tough are the millions upon millions of users.<p>On 4chan, you&#x27;re literally a janitor. On reddit, you&#x27;re a janitor and you&#x27;re <i>also</i> responsible for community building and everything that comes along with that. It&#x27;s <i>your</i> community and if you don&#x27;t build it, nobody will come.",1443043315

In my head, the string &quot;this.evaluate&quot; looks like an atom that expands to the operator this.evaluate(), which I think is what it means.<p>I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get used to the notation as it is, this is just my immediate impression.

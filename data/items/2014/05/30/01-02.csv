I can only hope the more genuine ones learned their lesson after it ended.<p>Best example: The poor fellow who left early to work for Yahoo at 8:00 am.  He may have only understood the ethics that he had bought into after it ended.<p>Women who try and make anything off this crap are selfish to the point of degrading those around them.  They&#x27;re really horrible people to be around, let alone to sleep with -- because they&#x27;re too self-absorbed with the money and free ride to factor in the precedent they&#x27;re setting for the kind of interaction that&#x27;s socially acceptable around potential mates.<p>DO WE REALLY want a society where people who work hard, are forced to compete financially to have an attractive mate fly in, do B-rolls, get high, and to demonstrate what a cold and mechanical interaction they actually want?<p>Women: How would you like it if this was the kind of world you had to live in to find affection from a man?  Pay $1,000 to have him come in and show you that your money, work, and desire for affection is just as worthless as anyone else&#x27;s.<p>Because THAT is what your actions convey.<p>I think I&#x27;m with my grandparents on this one:  These women need to learn to treat others exactly how they expect to be treated.  Otherwise nobody can be their friend, foe, or lover.<p>Because when we start pretending that relationships and affection can be bought -- we won&#x27;t be buying real affection.",1401415181

I&#x27;m not discounting them in a moral sense, though.<p>>  I&#x27;m arguing against your insistance that service jobs are zero-sum which is patently false.<p>I said that if there were only enough production to equal consumption, it would be zero sum in the net. In other words, the economy would not grow.<p>>  For instance, if I clean your home, landscape your yard, or do your laundry, it frees up your time to do something else more productive.<p>Yep, agreed. But if instead of doing something productive with my extra time, I work on a government boondoggle project like digging a ditch that isn&#x27;t needed, there would be no net growth in the economy from that, because what is happening (within the confines of the scenario) is purely consumption.<p>Anyway, hope I don&#x27;t sound too terse, this is a fun and interesting discussion and you are raising good points.",1401413827

Things like that happen - both in RL and on specialized sites - literally every second. Do you have to like it? No. There&#x27;s a lot of things that people do that I don&#x27;t like. However I would never imply that should not happen - apparently, there are a lot of people that do like doing those things, and as long as there are people willing to do this and nobody is hurt, it&#x27;s their business, not mine.

Drove my rented car back to the airport and hopped on the shuttle to the main terminal. Sat in my seat just as another guy struggled to get a box I recognized as a small computer onto the shuttle. He looked at me and I got up to help him but he had someone he was with who showed up and they lifted the box together.<p>The first guy was Ed Catmull in the video. I recognized him but didn&#x27;t know what to say and he got into some deep discussion with the guy he was with.<p>I got a job offer from Pixar but turned them down cause my first child was just born and, at the time, I was concerned about Pixar&#x27;s stability which turned out to be a correct belief back then.

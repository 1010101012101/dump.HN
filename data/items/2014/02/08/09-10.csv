The type of growth you&#x27;re referring to would be like rabbits versus cats, and their numbers are anything but stable.<p>And frankly, even if you can actually do that, give a stable species, the fact is that humans follow a pattern of massive expansion followed by large die-offs, rinse and repeat.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:World_population_growth_(lin-log_scale).png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:World_population_growth_(l...</a><p>Note the logarithmic scale. Realize what it means if, on that graph, there is a very slight but visible drop. Note that &quot;details&quot; like the holocaust + all worldwide WWII victims simply don&#x27;t register on that graph at all (events like that have been a near constant throughout history, just read what happened during islamic expansion in Europe over 700-800 years, with constant extermination campaigns usually, but not exclusively, by the invaders. And that&#x27;s something that barely registers if you compare it to the islamic massacres in India). Then realize that this is a smoothed graph, where you wouldn&#x27;t even see the majority of die-offs at all.<p>The minimum you&#x27;d need to see it on that graph at all is a 10% die off, and that would be a flat horizontal line. Can you imagine a 10% die-off ? The minimum we&#x27;d need to detect it >200 years back, is a plague-sized event. There were lots of those, as you can see.<p>That&#x27;s the species we are.

That person got others to start a lengthy and patronizing &quot;UI ideas process&quot; that was a smokescreen for going back on the MDI idea - when in reality the problem was the code to allow the UIs to dock properly - and to this day when I use GIMP the way they dock and tab the UIs goes against any learning model in my mind, and takes me forever to realize that what I am trying to find it hidden away somewhere.<p>There&#x27;s no good model to the UI (and the problem isn&#x27;t even a difficult one) because it&#x27;s trying to straddle one person&#x27;s personal ideas with a common and clear mental model of how certain actions should be grouped.",1391850900

Instead of confronting their belief system, present them with evidence from the modern world, and carefully guide them from an observation to a scientific conclusion -- but without calling it that.<p>Instead of saying &quot;science opposes religion, and science is right&quot;, instead tell the modern story of Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Explain that penicillin used to work, but a handful of bacteria were able to resist the penicillin, and those few bacteria, by surviving and procreating, eventually became all the bacteria. Then explain that we tried a different antibiotic which wiped out nearly all the bacteria again -- but not all of them. Again, the few survivors became the new species, and this entire drama played out over a period of years, not millennia, and we observed it happening with microscopes, not fossils, meaning there were no gaps in the fossil record to argue about.<p>Wait until your True Believer has grasped the basic idea, then let him visit a clinic filled with dying children. Then say, &quot;To solve this problem, to save these children, we need to understand and accept evolution, because these bacteria prove that evolution by natural selection is real.&quot;<p>There are as many similar examples as there are branches of modern science. Each of the stories can be told in an engaging, narrative way, with real people, in modern times, and it&#x27;s not even necessary to say &quot;science&quot;.",1391850455

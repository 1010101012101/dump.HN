I&#x27;ve always thought the problem was that it&#x27;s actually difficult to even come up with a definition of what fair is.<p>That&#x27;s perhaps true, and I observe what you say to be correct, but the lack of an acknowledged fair solution means that the existing solutions are all (party) political.<p>When Party A is in charge, they gerrymander in one direction, and when Party B is in charge, they then gerrymander in exactly the other (or perhaps a convenient tangent). The purpose of gerrymandering is to unfairly extend the period that you&#x27;re in power.<p>Having an ostensibly party-neutral solution that all parties can agree to is a useful solution.<p>It&#x27;s not immediately clear that this solution will really be fair, but it&#x27;s not immediately clear that it&#x27;s unfair, and at least it removes the politicking over boundaries.<p>If even a few regions start using this solution with the recognition that it is party-neutral, then parties in power elsewhere will start to be pressured into doing the same, to avoid appearing undemocratic.<p>It&#x27;s a one-step improvement on what happens now.",1443606991

In this case, I have created an unsafe situation... in a weird way).<p>I think a lot of people on bikes disrespect pedestrians. I find it reflects very badly on cyclists who <i>do</i> respect other people with whom they share public space, and on Parisians in general. People have priority, not least because I as a cyclist have a machine to help me move about and pedestrians don&#x27;t. There&#x27;s also civility and just being nice to one another in general.<p>I actually think words like &quot;pedestrian&quot;, &quot;cyclist&quot; and &quot;motorist&quot; create unnecessary conflicts of interest between people who live in the same city.

He also wants to be able to write concurrent systems, the best way to do this is of course write concurrent systems, not learning concurrent lang structs in scala or elixir. Only when you write a distributed system are you going to encounter all the networking and data integrity problems that arise at those lower levels and these are the things that are important to know and will give him reasons to choose elixir or scala or erlang or golang or whatever works best for him while building that.",1443604449

Essentially, you are being forced making a new app every other year, just to have an app, in spite of the fact that the old one(s) work perfectly well and everyone is happy with them. In my book, that is throwing money - it&#x27;s cost us half the price to keep three other competing platforms afloat.<p>And I find it disheartening that most developers seem so accepting of unnecessary costs to their time and health. Much like the worker class before the unions - any work conditions go.

I also find it disheartening developer companies don&#x27;t take a good look at costs and demand improvements, instead of accepting a steady trickle of punishment for success.<p>If it is for the platform&#x27;s good, I wish the platform ended so we can develop for platforms that deliver better working conditions and less motivated uncertainty, fear, and doubt.",1443604220

But what do you do if there&#x27;s no signal and they are riding the inner lane ? Do you plunge right in only to see they were after all about to exit, just forgot to signal ? Very risky.<p>I see the signal as a way to communicate inside the circular road, where normal lane rules apply: you keep your lane, and if the lane in right is free, you can switch to it after signaling. Repeat until exit.<p>Also, a left signal before entering is useful: it says you are taking the 3rd or more exit, and that you will make a tight turn around the center, with slow speed. This way, people entering after you can plan to pass you on your right and continue forward.",1443604022

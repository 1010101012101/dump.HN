5702644,comment,5699552,5702108,11,0,to3m,,,"I tried some super-simple test code and ran it through the PS3 compilers... but was unable to get either to turn the variable-width shift into a fixed-width one. With the right flag included, gcc was even good enough to warn me about the microcoded instruction.<p>I also tried gcc (OS X, x64) and llvm (OS X, x64/ARM) and they didn't do the transformation either. (I'm not sure I would expect this for ARM anyway, but for x64 the variable shift code looked a bit more involved than I was expecting. Perhaps a transformation into a fixed-width shift would be beneficial in that case as well.)<p>Test code:<p><pre><code>    float f(const float *f,unsigned mask){\n        unsigned i;\n        float t=0.f;\n        \n        for(i=0;i<32;++i){\n            if(mask&(1<<i))\n                t+=f[i];\n        }\n        \n        return t;\n    }\n        \n    float f2(const float *f,unsigned mask){\n        unsigned i,m;\n        float t=0.f;\n        \n        for(i=0,m=1;i<32;++i,m<<=1){\n            if(mask&m)\n                t+=f[i];\n        }\n        \n        return t;\n    }\n</code></pre>\nCompile options were ""-O3"" for SNC (this seems to be about your lot as far as options go) and ""-O6 -fstrength-reduce"" for gcc (obviously I could spend all day fiddling with all the possible options, but I won't, which I admit is a flaw in my experiment - but I believe snc is supposed to produce much better code anyway). And in both cases, the code for `f' includes a variable shift, and the code for `f2' didn't.<p>Still, I would stand by my maxim even if the data in this case were against me. It's the winning strategy. Why rely on the compiler's ability to second-guess your intentions, when you could just tell it what you want, straight up?",1368496669

They're not assholes for taking a reward and running. The reward should be great because the risk and sacrifice is also excessive.</i><p>Different pools. The people who get funded by VC-istan are not risk-takers. They're people with gold-plated resumes and connections before 35, which means they never made mistakes-- because you can't get that far by that age if you make a misstep-- which means they aren't risk-takers. They didn't have to live off of savings, and as far as TechCrunch and acquirers are concerned, they don't exist.<p>Yes, those ""hundreds of entrepreneurs"" deserve a lot of credit. They have cojones, and a lot of them actually fail (not acqui-fail, but actually fail). However, their stories have no bearing on the risk in VC-istan, because they live outside of it.<p>In VC-istan, Real Founders (people with the credibility to raise money without a 5-sigma success already in hand) don't take much risk. They get full salary from the go, and as long as they don't bite the hand, they get EIR sinecures afterward if nothing else works out.

Examples from Google's page:<p><pre><code>  var service map[string]net.Addr\n</code></pre>\nWhen I read this it's easy to skip seeing string, aside from the fact that ] as a delimiter also looks like net.Addr was accidentally combined with the previous line.<p><pre><code>  func ParallelWrite(data []byte) chan error {\n\tres := make(chan error, 2)\n\tf1, err := os.Create(""file1"")\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tres <- err\n\t} else {\n</code></pre>\nHere we see no parenthesizes used in if statements, yet we retain {. In skimming it's easy to miss the if in the first place. Yet everywhere else they're happy to use parenthesizes. We also see that ""make"" is lowercase yet a method, but os.Create and ParallelWrite has caps for a method.<p>There's also the fact that the array (I'm guessing) of bytes diverges from every other language to put them in front of the type which looks like crap. We see the same poor choices of delimiters as with map value types.<p>Then there's this<p><pre><code>  func main() {\n\tc := make(chan bool)\n\tm := make(map[string]string)\n\tgo func() {\n\t\tm[""1""] = ""a"" // First conflicting access.\n\t\tc <- true\n\t}()\n\tm[""2""] = ""b"" // Second conflicting access.\n\t<-c\n\tfor k, v := range m {\n\t\tfmt.Println(k, v)\n\t}\n  }\n</code></pre>\n<-c looks like its just dangling, and if this is meant to say there's some kind of stream or assignment then does it just go to /dev/null? Yet ""c <- true"" is also correct? I'd argue for either void <- c, _ <- c, or c.read() if wanted to support something like that.<p>It's also difficult to tell in the for loop if v is being assigned as ""range m"", or if ""k, v"" are a tuple resulting from ""range m""<p>It's too bad because the goals of the language are quite nice from a CS perspective.",1368495754

I understand that  many programmers are uncomfortable with selling stuff that doesn't exist yet, because to them it feels fraudulent. But there are a lot of ways you can get around that feeling and leave customers feeling happy.<p>A good example is Kickstarter. People sell imaginary products on there all the time. And this has gone on in the software business for a long time. Microsoft, for example, got their start selling a product that didn't exist:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft#1972.E2.80.9383:_Founding_and_company_beginnings"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft#1972.E2.80.9383:_Foun...</a><p>I think that approach was a little dubious (although it's hard to argue with the results), but I'm perfectly happy with Kickstarter. For me, the difference is that with Kickstarter they're being honest.<p>There are also things you can do that are in between. For example, the landing page that talks about a ""coming soon"" product is fine by me. As is a guerrilla user test where you have people look at several things, some of which are products that don't exist yet. Or getting your clients to sign a letter saying, ""If you build X, we will pay you Y for it.""<p>And honestly, people do order things on talk alone. A lot of enterprise software starts out that way. It seems crazy from a programmer perspective, but if you're running a business you frequently make small bets on new suppliers to see whether they can deliver.

Everyone sees an exit differently, whether it is your customer, your co-founder, your peers, or even your mother-in-law.<p>Customers can fall in love with a product, evangelize it, and use it, and then have it vanish in an 'exit.' That certainly feels like betrayal. Not surprisingly when someone you care about dies you can find yourself mad at them for dying. But if you don't know the circumstances you cannot judge accurately.<p>One of the saddest things I see are companies that create a wonderful service but it costs $10/user on a month to month basis to run and their service is either free or much much less than that per user subscription. You can go to your users and say ""Uh, we actually need much more money from you to keep going."" But that too leaves them feeling betrayed or 'bait and switched.'<p>Acqui-hire exits are rarely ""big"" exits for anyone. They are face saving exits. And everyone involved puts on a happy face not to make the customers feel bad in a sort of 'so long sucka!' kind of way but in order to maintain the fiction for polite conversation. These folks feel bad about it too but it is even more awkward when they are looking sad when the 'press' is all happy times.<p>Perhaps a more honest approach might be to upload what assets you have to 'github' and say ""hey this costs $X to run and we can't afford it."" or ""This is a great idea that about 382 people really like and over a million have looked at and never logged in again."" But sometimes even the wee bit of IP that is left over in the source repositories might be sold to a patent troll or something to cover some of the investor's losses.<p>Feeling sad, betrayed, and angry are all honest emotions to have around the shutdown of a product you care about.

As flawed as the U.S. government is, it's still better than almost any government outside Western Europe, and is in some ways better than governments in Western Europe (e.g. with regard to free speech), though worse in others.<p>The U.S. government very rarely ignores the Constitution, although many things it does are greeted with cries of ignoring the Constitution. It goes to great lengths to lawyer it's way around the Constitution, no doubt, but most countries don't even bother.<p>As for externally--the Constitution puts almost no limits on the American government's ability to intervene in foreign affairs, and most Americans would agree that the U.S. has zero obligation to do anything internationally other than what advances its own interests. No other country in the world would do any differently if they were in the U.S.'s position.

I also don't disagree that there almost certainly isn't an evil council scheming to make corporations more powerful (I'm not a fan of conspiracy theories, and this particular conspiracy sounds especially absurd -- I'm not even sure that the corporations are getting more powerful in the first place).<p>However, while ""it's complex"" is the <i>right</i> answer, it's almost certainly never a <i>good</i> answer. I run a company with a team of eleven, and ""it's complex"" often comes up as an answer to difficult challenges. Well, it <i>is</i> complex and it isn't. Difficult issues are difficult by definition, but doing nothing is almost never the right answer. There is sufficient body of evidence to at least establish a pattern of civil rights being eroded in the U.S., granted for very complex and often perfectly valid reasons. That's what leadership is about -- cutting through complexity to guide the overarching system in the right direction. I don't think it's unreasonable to expect that from our government.<p>EDIT: I also agree that the original argument smells unnecessarily of conspiracy theories and drastically oversimplifies the issues.",1368493218

That doesn&#x27;t mean leave as soon as you&#x27;ve got a handle on the hot new technology you applied because you wanted on your resume. Almost every company or code awe has something to teach you about process or architecture or politics or people or business or an industry. But there will also come a point where everything is rote and there are no longer any significant challenges for you, even if you seek them out. If you can&#x27;t then get a promotion or transfer into a new and more challenging role, that&#x27;s when it&#x27;s time to move on.<p>Hiring and training represent a major investment of time and energy (and sometimes money). If your job history shows you rarely stick around even for one year, a lot of companies will be wary because they get a much greater return on that investment from an employee who sticks around for at least a couple years. If you leave after 6-9 months, the ROI may even be negative.<p>This goes double for small startups, for which a month or two of resume reading and interviewing by the CTO, for instance, followed by a few weeks of training and onboarding and a few months in which the new hire is at <100% productivity while they get up to speed on the existing codebase and tooling/processes, can put a major dent in software development progress. (Note: we&#x27;re talking about knowledge work here - the economics are a bit different for pizza delivery staff.)<p>That doesn&#x27;t mean you should stay in a job that you quickly determine is a poor fit. A short stay or two on an otherwise solid resume isn&#x27;t a big deal. It&#x27;s just that a pattern of them signals high risk.<p>That said, staying somewhere (other than as a founder) for more than about 5 years is also a red flag for anyone who began their career after about 1995. Not only is that sort of employee loyalty rare these days, it can suggest stagnation, since few employers invest in developing their employees any more. Although that can be mitigated by demonstrating a series of significant promotions, changes in role, and assumption of greater responsibility.<p>As a hiring manager, I expect a resume to reflect a mix of tenures ranging from ~18 months to 3 or 4 years. If you have more than one <9 month stay for every two places you stuck around for at least 18 months, I&#x27;ll probably give you a pass.

In my opinion the benefit still outweighs these arguments (as most of these could also be applicable to a regular car driven by a person), but if someone wants to have a go at self-drive cars, here&#x27;s some ammo instead of blanks:<p>- Malicious Hacking - People with malicious intent can hack the cars by using devices to confuse/misinform their sensors, or by finding ways to amend the car&#x27;s code (perhaps amending at source, perhaps by patching the car with the malicious code).  This isn&#x27;t something a layman could do - so the risk of an idiot loner is small; however if all of our infrastructure moves to AI cars the payoff could attract some organised and skilled attacks.<p>- Poor Maintenance - cars would self diagnose and ensure issues are dealt with promptly; however if people are still doing the repair work they may make mistakes which the car cannot see (at some point the car has to assume it can trust its sensors) - so those mistakes may cause unpredictable issues.<p>- Geek Play - If you had an AI car and knew a bit about coding, how tempted would you be to put some of your own code in there - maybe just to give it KIT&#x27;s accent.  Most of the car&#x27;s controls would be locked down, but people would look to jailbreak their cars so they could do such customisations, which may have unforeseen side effects.  This would be illegal, but some would still try.<p>- EMP - there&#x27;s a concern that EMPs can be caused naturally by solar flares, which could have significant impact on our infrastructure.  If not properly shielded, cars could be affected by such issues: <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/tombarlow/2011/06/23/huge-solar-flares-could-spell-catastrophe-for-earth/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.forbes.com/sites/tombarlow/2011/06/23/huge-solar-...</a><p>- Refusal to drive unsafely - in an emergency it&#x27;s OK to break the rules (this person will die if we don&#x27;t get them to hospital in 10 minutes).  An AI car will be designed to put safety first, so likely won&#x27;t allow you to break the rules even in such a situation.  If the rules can be broken in such a scenario, people could just declare emergencies when running late.  Perhaps a compromise is to allow overrides such as &quot;get to nearest hospital asap&quot; rather than just a generic override, and to penalise anyone misusing this facility - however there will always be unforeseen edge cases (though these will be rapidly diminishing & the cars will still be far preferable to humans given they&#x27;ll at least prioritise public safety).<p>- Unforeseen special cases - Y2K, Y2K38, Patriot missile clock, north pole sub divide zero coordinates bug, etc are examples of issues caused by oversight: more here <a href=""http://listverse.com/2012/12/24/10-seriously-epic-computer-software-bugs/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://listverse.com/2012/12/24/10-seriously-epic-computer-s...</a>.

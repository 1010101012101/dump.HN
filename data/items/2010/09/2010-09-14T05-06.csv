However, a profitable model is not necessarily a sustainable one. You could fill your schedule with client-contracted work and pay the monthly overhead and maybe yourselves too, but it's not the most sustainable long-term business strategy (unless you really want to be doing this forever.)<p>So you contract/consult to pay the bills, at the same time devoting a reasonable portion of your time to building your own products and looking for your ""homerun.""",1284443991

For instance, with a coworker, see if they want to grab lunch one day or get some coffee during a break. Making friends sometimes takes time. You need to see if you're compatible with the person enough to be able to do stuff with them.<p>If you're a hacker or entrepreneur (which I'm assuming b/c you're on this site), there are plenty of meetup groups from startups.

Due to the difficulty of modeling the possibilities, only mutual funds were considered.  So people like George Soros did not get counted.

The expected performance semantics of a switch (something better than O(n) in the number of cases) rules out simplistic iterated jumps in big cases. The programmer expects O(1), or at worst, O(log n).<p>But more importantly, CPUs generally have many more capabilities than are exposed by C, and this is where the ""1:1 correspondence"" really falls down.

I’m not a coder (although I can understand code) but have great people skills- I communicate well, can make friends easily, have no problems networking, I can manage people, organize projects, have many business ideas (yeah, I know ideas are nothing without execution, but it’s still good to have them), have good marketing skills and a excellent business sense and can do a great job of selling products/ideas that I’m passionate about.  While I know enough Java, PHP, SQL to be dangerous, I don’t really have a desire (or maybe ability?) to be a hotshot coder.<p>My educational background is an MS in IT, a conversion degree focused on project management, web development, DB management and similar subjects, with a BS in Finance and a year of law school.  In February I got my first tech job, as a QA for a 100 person company- I chose a QA position for several reasons: 1. it was what was available and student loan payments were due and 2. It is a good way to see a tech company from many sides (I interact with devs, product and marketing on a daily basis).  I’m doing well- learning quickly, receiving excellent reviews and taking on more and more responsibilities.<p>My strategy is focused on learning more about the industry while networking and launching my own non-tech business to get some entrepreneurial experience and hands on practice.  I’ve been building a base of contacts by attending various Meetup events as well as co-organizing and hosting ad publisher’s meetup (meetup.com/sfadpub).  I’m working with some friends to launch a t-shirt company; we’re about 2 months from going “live.”  The hope is to build enough knowledge and contacts to be able to take advantage of an opportunity when one comes up.<p>Is there more that I should be doing?  Should I bite the bullet and focus on improving my coding abilities (at the expense of my networking activities and the time I spend learning about marketing, business development and other areas that are my strengths)?  Do ideas/companies in the very early stages even need someone like me?<p>Any advice would be greatly appreciated!",1284443335

Because of that, most doctors do not really see this as a problem, let alone one that needs fixing.<p>The problem is that meeting a doctor cannot be planned perfectly. A meeting might take 5 minutes, or it might take 20.<p>If, on average, a doctor can serve 4 patients an hour, and she wants to reach that on a 9-5 working day, she must schedule her first patient at 08:45 or thereabouts. Reason: the first patient might be late. That would give her idle minutes that she would need to serve later patients, some of which might take 20 minutes.<p>Similarly, she must schedule her second patient at 09:00-ish, to have a patient waiting in case the first one happens to take only 5 minutes to serve.<p>And yes, that appears rude, but mostly, it is the economical thing to do. You can only get better service by paying your doctor more. You will notice that many people who can afford that are willing to do so.

1689617,comment,1689274,1689473,0,0,papa,,,"Well the problem may vary from provider to provider (and country to country), but after observing my wife's situation as a physician in the U.S., I can tell you that many doctors aren't late volitionally.<p>First, the problem isn't easily fixed. Here's the deal: At her HMO each doctor has a panel of several thousand patients. Each patient visit during a normal clinical day gets a 15 minute allocation with the MD. It used to be 20 minutes at her HMO but was recently reduced in order to increase the patient volume. Typically my wife's schedule is stacked appointment to appointment from 8-Noon and then again from 1-5pm. A couple of time slots are left unscheduled for high priority, emergent visits (if you've got a routine visit, forget it, you'll get something a month or two out into the future).<p>No as you can imagine, 15 minutes per patient isn't much time. Some patients require more time. With each successive visit, the wait will get longer and longer. This isn't because the doctor (at least some of them) is being a jerk or dismissive, it's because they're trying to do a thorough job with the time allocated. If they can't finish what they need to in 15 minutes, well, she goes over that time. It isn't too hard to realize how screwed up the schedule can get after a couple of tough back-to-back cases.<p>My wife then tries to catch up during lunch hour because she doesn't take lunch. After working through lunch, she kicks into the afternoon half of clinic hopefully caught up, but sometimes not. And the cycle repeats itself.<p>The receptionists can't ""easily structure"" the appointments more appropriately -- at least at the large providers -- b/c they're not the ones running the game.<p>I'm not going to defend the overall system. That's a much bigger problem and mess that a lot of smart people have looked at and have yet to solve. But I do think it's worth realizing that, yes, many doctors do think your time is valuable and don't purposefully try to waste your time. Many doctors are overworked and are doing the best they can within the parameters of what they've been given to practice medicine and that at some point you might be that person that has an appointment that goes over the time allocated (and when you do, hopefully you'll be happy the doctor ended up being attentive to those needs).<p>Just hoping to lend some extra perspective (especially as someone who used to feel the same way you do).",1284442798

I wish I could give you some example searches too, but most of what has bugged me lately relates to stuff which might brush up against NDA terms, so I don't feel comfy giving specifics.<p>Overall I still love Google, I must use the search service 50 times a day so complaints about shortcomings are a bit like grumbling about the paintwork on my free new car :-) So I'll try and identify two recurring (and relatively new-feeling) headaches:<p>1. quotes. When I put it ""in quotes"" I don't want ti speell-checked, or cleaned, or made case-insensitive, or whatever else. I would rather get not results and experiment with other strings, than think I've got results that turn out not to be exactly what I searched for. It <i>seems</i> to me like punctuation often gets stripped even if it's inside quotes. For some kinds of searches involving bits of source code or so, this can be a drag.<p>2. Content farming. I know you are constantly struggling against people gaming the system and so forth. I don't blame  Google when I get 50 results of generic junk referring to obscure search terms...the ""find [niche product] resellers, hints, tips!"" types that are totally generic. but what <i>does</i> piss me off is that a few months ago Google offered  a button that would let zap such results, and I could label clutter as clutter. Now on a deep search, I often spend several minutes trying to think what terms are common enough to content farms that -excluding them will prune the results sufficiently that the remaining search results are worth checking one by one.<p>You remember that Bing ad where someone says something random and their geeky partner starts hypnotically chanting associated but unhelpful phrases, implying an overbroad result set?

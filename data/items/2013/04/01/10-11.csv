For example, if you're serving a GeoJSON document, which is a open format used by many services, it makes sense to use a specific mediatype. If, on the other hand, the format is totally custom to your service, I don't really see the point, since the client parsing it must be custom too.<p>The only advantage I can see to using custom mediatypes is if you want to do versioning (+v1, +v2, etc).",1364813936

There are a number of factors that determine which category a worker falls into. The most important of these is called the right of control.

But it also means the employer has the right to dictate both the means and the manner in which the worker performs the job. If this is the case, then the relationship is that of an employer and an employee. However, if the employer can control only the final results of the work, then the parties have an employer-independent contractor relationship.</i>",1364813802

The Wild West was not characterized by regulation! For one thing, the de facto repeal of the Tenth Amendment and expansion of the Commerce Clause limiting the federal government had not yet happened in the early US. America's defining characteristic from 1776 to 1860 or so was extraordinarily low levels of government intervention; once Reconstruction ended, that was roughly true again till World War 1 or so. Just to give a taste of how freewheeling it was, the US had <i>private monetary systems</i> in the antebellum period:<p><a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/history-of-the-free-bank-era-2013-2?op=1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businessinsider.com/history-of-the-free-bank-era-...</a><p><pre><code>  For a quarter of a century, America's states and \n  territories, and the institutions within them, began \n  circulating their own currency, as the agrarian mistrust of \n  centralized banking eventually climaxed in the destruction \n  of the Second Bank of the United States in 1832.\n</code></pre>\nYou do also realize that there wasn't even an income tax till 1913, and that most of the US revenue was provided by tariffs even through the 1800s? It is just utterly, stunningly false to state that the ""the [US] government has always regulated pretty much everything that was commercial"". I'm not trying to be rude, but it makes me doubt that you have studied any American history prior to 1900. Your claim is like stating that most Americans spoke French as their first tongue.<p>Now to your main contention:<p><pre><code>  The SEC exists for a reason. That reason is that the 1920's \n  demonstrated that the financial industry couldn't be \n  trusted to completely regulate itself\n</code></pre>\nCan the SEC be trusted to regulate itself? You do know what career status is, right? Three years of noncontiguous service in the federal government and you are employed for life. You cannot be fired. And so you do this:<p><a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2010/POLITICS/04/23/sec.porn/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cnn.com/2010/POLITICS/04/23/sec.porn/index.html</a><p><pre><code>  SEC staffers watched porn as economy crashed. As the \n  country was sinking into its worst financial crisis in more \n  than 70 years, Security and Exchange Commission employees \n  and contractors cruised porn sites and viewed sexually \n  explicit pictures using government computers, according to \n  an agency report obtained by CNN. More than half of the \n  workers made between $99,000 and $223,000. All the cases \n  took place over the past five years.\n</code></pre>\nMoreover, can the SEC be trusted to regulate the financial industry? The SEC is the definition of a captured agency, completely in thrall to large banks (as Elizabeth Warren recently showed). We can trust the SEC to harass Bitcoin, Paypal, and startups. We can also trust the SEC to be bribed or captured out of regulating the financial markets. Only real competition can regulate such markets, the competition that comes from eliminating barriers to entry and allowing folks like Angel List and Funders Club to disrupt clubby Wall Street.<p><pre><code>  and would use information asymmetries to its advantage to \n  bilk investors out of their money. \n</code></pre>\nCaveat emptor is the only protection against bad investments. The idea that the SEC would protect investors from being bilked is laughable. The government is suing S&P in retaliation for downgrading the US debt!<p><a href=""http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111903596904576518460162935404.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB1000142405311190359690457651...</a><p><pre><code>  There are other disturbing questions related to the timing \n  and the target of this federal civil prosecution. S&P's \n  attorney Floyd Abrams tells us that ""things seemed to rev \n  up in terms of the intensity"" of the federal investigation \n  after S&P's historic downgrade of United States credit \n  following Washington's debt-limit fight in 2011. Meanwhile, \n  a McClatchy Newspapers report says that it was around that \n  time that Moody's, which did not downgrade the government, \n  was dropped from the federal investigation. Ask any \n  investor and he'll likely tell you that Moody's was equally \n  awful in forecasting the mortgage debacle.\n</code></pre>\nDoes the SEC rate US Treasuries as comparable to junk bonds, with significant sovereign default risk? Does the SEC tell Americans that their dollars are being inflated away to be direct deposited in the accounts of large banks? Given the events of the last five years, it is only extraordinary ignorance or chutzpah that could lead someone to claim that the SEC protects investors. Only you can protect yourself against bad investments.<p><pre><code>  Similar lessons have been learned with regards to the food \n  industry, drug industry, manufacturing industries, etc.\n  </code></pre>\nNo. This is just a rehash of the conventional wisdom. Without FDRs regulatory state we would ostensibly be victims of those evil businesses, as we are incapable of judging product quality on our own. Therefore we need to give up our judgment as consumers to unelected regulators, who will intercede and corral industry on our behalf, naturally, despite the fact that they have zero accountability and literally cannot be fired. You mention drugs. Weve talked about how the SEC is a corrupt failure. The FDA is also a corrupt failure.

Those suspicions \n  intensified when they learned that he had filed similar \n  whistle-blowing lawsuits against two previous employers, \n  Yale and Cornell.\n</code></pre>\n<a href=""http://articles.latimes.com/2002/jun/17/business/fi-imclone17"" rel=""nofollow"">http://articles.latimes.com/2002/jun/17/business/fi-imclone1...</a><p><pre><code>  Source of Tip on ImClone Drug Is Identified\n\n  Greenwood said he understood that Turner was formally \n  representing Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., ImClone's partner on \n  Erbitux, at the time he passed along the FDA information. \n  If that is true, the FDA official who gave Turner the \n  information, Richard Pazdur, almost certainly had a legal \n  right to do so, and Turner would have had a right to \n  receive it.\n\n  But that does not mean people who received Turner's \n  information had the right to sell shares ahead of the bad \n  news.

Cables are gathered in bundles and burned to get rid of the insulation.  Burning plastics (on open fires, in the open air, with no worker protections) are nasty.  Lack of education and equipment and skills mean the worthwhile bits are not recovered (from PCBs - no copper, gold, lead, etc) and any safety equipment is sold for cash.

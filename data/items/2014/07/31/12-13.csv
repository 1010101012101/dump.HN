8113774,comment,8112842,8112842,3,0,aredington,,,"Keep in mind that read-string, eval, and load-string are all exploit vectors. Read-string exposes you to the #= eval macro, which can execute arbitrary code at read time, as well as various vulnerabilities with object construction.<p>Eval executes the data it receives without any sandboxing or sanity checking, any data that has ever had any user influence should be suspect. 9 times out of 10, if you&#x27;re using eval, you should be using a function reference.<p>Load-string is likewise vulnerable to the eval macro and constructor attack vectors.<p>clojure.edn offers safe versions of read and read-string that do not use the eval macro. You can get load-string equivalent behavior by wrapping the string in a StringReader and then clojure.edn/reading it until eof. If you&#x27;re reading data that&#x27;s had any influence from an end user, always use the clojure.edn facilities, and never eval it.",1406811522

One would think this would work:<p><pre><code>    (defn map-recurse [coll f]\n      (if-not (coll? coll)\n        (f coll)\n        (into (empty coll) (map #(map-recurse % f) coll)))\n</code></pre>\nAlas.

8113729,comment,8112844,8113591,1,0,RyanMiller,,,"True and it&#x27;s a fair observation. But I&#x27;m sure that modern and future automation will create a fundamental shift in how we see ourselves. Understandable that it&#x27;s jarring to most people. My biggest concerns are that not enough will change to accommodate this future. Given how customarily slow government is to accurately and appropriately re-access policies/laws when new technology dramatically changes our civilization. If I think enough about it I realize just how blindly optimistic this all is. Frankly thinking like this might be one of the reasons we may help us reach beyond the coal and sky.<p>You&#x27;re probably right that this isn&#x27;t the future we&#x27;ll get. Just like that old prediction that the Radioisotope generator would power all electronics since it was the superior energy source at the time. Then Chernobyl hysteria changed our future. Probably just like some famous automated car crash that will likely occur. Or a neo-luddite media circus. Who knows what&#x27;s gonna happen in 50 years.<p>I don&#x27;t think automation means removing human interaction out of the picture. And I think people&#x27;s desire for a person to do this work is going to subside as more interactions are personal instead of commercial. It&#x27;ll free up us to do activities that are more creative, experimental & empathetic with each other. So if anything, it&#x27;d be redistributing human interaction into more social roles than compared to a face punching buttons and pulling levers.<p>The whole giving people in Retirement homes electronics animal things to cover the basic human requirement of physical touch and simulated bonding would become unnecessary (hopefully). Since families lifetimes wouldn&#x27;t be devastated/adsorbed by trying to sustain your bodies physical requirements and running the financial treadmill optimized by bankers.<p>&quot;I doubt we will all become engineers, scientists and technologists&quot; We don&#x27;t need to all become those things. But to orient our education in new ways to supports primarily these groups and the rest of people learn value creating activities that support each other & themselves. There will probably be some kind currently unimaginable creatives economy where large parts of society are centered around art and media.<p>Yeah this turned into a huge stupid rant. Time to sleep the stupid off.<p>For instance, automation of carpentry won&#x27;t destroy carpentry as a skill. Because people like doing these things and when they aren&#x27;t forced do it. As a wage as it&#x27;s often a creative outlet. Many love their jobs as a hobby but it just becomes work for a wage. Then the hobby become a chore and no longer satisfying or valuable personal time investment. Especially if we start considering how little time we have on Earth.<p>This could be as significant as the step from Slavery to Workers. Except instead of soft-choice, this would put voluntarism as the center piece. Which would then lead to society&#x27;s institutions being also based on charity/voluntarism.",1406810874

It&#x27;s no exception that the writer would use 2 or more colors even for simple text, for example just to highlight capitals. Don&#x27;t think I have ever seen anyone doing that in the present. Also the maps from those days often look like sceneries from some fairytale with nicely drawn castles etc. Not like your average roadmap :P",1406808173

An extra one-time 10% turnover won&#x27;t make a puddle of difference.<p>In winter in particular, the rate of through-roof air leaks is also greater when temperatures are warmer due to the stack effect.  The author is completely wrong on this front - it&#x27;s far better to let your house cool down and then re-heat.<p>The only time this isn&#x27;t true is if you have a two-mechanism heating system such as a heat pump with resistance heat backup, where a large temperature swing invokes the more expensive resistance heater.  The author doesn&#x27;t.",1406808004

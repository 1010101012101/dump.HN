Checking all words of length N vs length N+1 that way took a few minutes on my (not very powerful) netbook. Not entirely happy with it, but no way I could optimize that further in 15 minutes anyway (if there is an even better algorithm), and that part of the calculation is done.<p><i>edit:</i> just thought of a better way<p><pre><code>    aa = sorted([words of length N])
    bb = [words of length N+1]

    # now make a sorted list of the longer words, truncated on either side,
    # (paired with the original for retrieval later)
    bb1 = sorted([(w[1:], w) for w in bb]

There&#x27;s no way that Obama will accept Congress gutting his biggest achievement. It&#x27;s possible that some of the 34 states effected will create their own exchanges - and hopefully the courts will delay the ruling for enough time to allow this to happen smoothly - but in many states the animosity towards Obamacare is so strong that this will not be possible. It seems likely that the result will be that millions of people will suddenly lose access to health care. And when that happens a lot of people who have chronic conditions will just stop going to the doctor and filling their prescriptions.

There are just as many counter-point scenarios to the &quot;dog pissing&quot; one presented (which is rather weak in my opinion).<p>Anecdotal evidence is the best evidence and there are a lot of claims on both sides.

So the end result of a bunch of competition is an efficient company ... but how efficient was the process of getting to that end result? So for example once you count all the failed competitors in a given market, the bankruptcies, redundancies, people who invested their time and money in failing businesses. Has anyone measured the overall &#x27;efficiency&#x27; of a competitive system whittling down the competitors to the viable ones?

If a customer comes to us with some specific requirements (like being able to index 100MM documents with some specific response time guarantees), we build dedicated pieces of infrastructure for them, load-test it all and provide those guarantees. All of the others are placed in their own pools which have enough capacity to handle 3-5x of ALL of our current traffic with no issues, so any single customer would not be able to generate enough load to cause problems.<p>And, as I mentioned in the article, we could always order new boxes for any of our clusters and get them online within a couple hours, so we are able to scale up pretty quickly if  needed.",1426540552

You&#x27;ve also removed the element of maintaining a body (exercise, eating, hygiene) as well as expanded potential interfaces (direct connection to the internet) so that even a 1:1 silicon brain would presumably be more efficient.<p>The next thing you can do is optimize the time step element, so that for every 1 second of thinking in a silicon brain, it has performed the equivalent of 10 seconds of thinking in a human brain. At that point, you&#x27;ve surpassed human intelligence.

First of all - doing the latter would involve me being forced to stop a moving car to engage in such an interaction.  I have a rental car because my intent is to drive somewhere, not interact with someone I do not know through means of video.  &quot;Personablity&quot; does not play into this conversation at all unfortunately - unless a random Hertz employee complimenting me on my attire or hair style at a given moment is a contributing factor to my <i>car rental experience</i>.<p>Regarding &quot;it is very easy to get riled up about security&quot;.  Yes, it is - as it very well should be.  What happens if I hand a credit card over to a passenger and the &quot;NeverLost&quot; snaps an image of the digits?  Highly unlikely but plausible - is Hertz going to guarantee PCI compliance of the footage?  What if a group of individuals working for a defense contractor rent a car and are all discussing a secret, or top secret, program they are all cleared for?  What are the implications of controlling that data?<p>I fully understand there is a gray middle-ground - however people have an expectation of privacy in a vehicle today.  There are just as many counter-point scenarios to the &quot;dog pissing&quot; one presented (which is rather weak in my opinion).<p>That leads me to the question: do rental car companies have that much loss with which can be offset by having monitoring capabilities (video and audio)?

If the utility is for customer experience improvement - again, it&#x27;s a large risk for Hertz to take on to provide minimal improvement in a rental experience and I doubt they&#x27;ve considered the edge cases that may put them in more fiscal predicament than not having it at all.<p>If anything these devices should be opt-in, meaning they can be removed by any customer prior to taking the rental vehicle.

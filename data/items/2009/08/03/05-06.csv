AT&T doesn't control the app store, that's all Apple, and I don't believe GV is available on any non-US Apple app stores, so this isn't only an AT&T issue.",1249279033

Learned more in one year at a software job than most people get in four years at a college.<p>But that is a great point: a lot of organizations, particularly big organizations, use a college degree as a ""credential"" for their first level of sorting through job applicants.<p>Yes indeed, college has become a clumsy sort of job training.  That's how it is, and we have to deal with that.<p>However, colleges are not all the same.  Small liberal-arts colleges are keeping the ""community of scholars and teachers"" tradition alive.  Community colleges have a peculiar split in focus: between vocational training and college prep.  Big state colleges offer undergrads training mostly in bureaucratic hoop-jumping, in order to fund real research.",1249278500

I might get an electric motorcycle first though since new car models tend to have problems in their first year so I imagine the first year of a completely different kind of car is going to be rife with headaches.<p>Basically it's the same as my phone situation. I don't want an iPhone because of Apple's management of it. I prefer owning what I've paid for and having another company tell me what I can and can't do with my own property doesn't sit well with me.

738684,comment,738171,738443,0,0,AmericanOP,,,"I really enjoy MIT's free course material. I loaded every lecture pdf onto my iphone and slowly but surely have been making my way through their mba program. Based on my experience, I do not think a dedicated school program would work based on this material, and I am someone who is ALL for reform in higher education.<p>The main reason is the nature of the content. Anybody can work their way through a management psychology or communication class, but you'd have to be very far out on the bell curve to teach yourself optimization models and statistical data mining based on this material alone. You could be familiar with how to do it based on lecture notes, which is my goal, but without help not one of your 18-year-olds could correctly solve these problems in the real world. They could educate to a degree, but their ability would be nowhere near traditional students. The pedigree's value will be preserved.<p>Most of the classes have missing or incomplete material since OpenCourseware is clearly an afterthought. Someone would really have to go through the course reading list to be able to say they took the class.",1249277915

On the one hand, I have learned a hell of a lot about Computer Science in college, but I could have survived an entry level programming job damn near anywhere straight out of high school. The problem is that the degree is a barrier to entry; it is almost impossible to get a decent job without one unless you are absolutely spectacular at what you do.<p>My friend once had this argument with me, saying that college isn't intended to train people for the job.

There is a big difference between government intervention and government run organizations. Government run implies inefficiency and waste. There will always be people that game the system. I am well aware of that, but if all the government did was make it a non profit it would do a lot to mitigate against the mass profitering that is going on right now.<p>2. Sallie Mae no longer has any ties with the government and Freddie Mac is a government sponsored enterprise. In fact they were both set up as government sponsored enterprises when they first started. Enterprise implies an entity that is in it for the money.<p>As for your third question I do not know of any but it would be enlightening if someone knew of one.",1249276953

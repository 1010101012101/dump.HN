60062,comment,60020,60020,0,0,hhm,,,"This one is very good... I found the only way to get higher in life, in profession, in anything, is to acknowledge the own limitations. Whenever the time comes that you start feeling you are really good, you are getting worse instead: as to be really good, you need to get even better, and you can only do that if you are humble enough to recognize your own leaks.<p>And it doesn't care if you are Einstein or Mozart... the battle for skills isn't against other people, but against nature. Einstein needed to get always better to understand more of the nature, and the same for Mozart and his music.<p>At least, that's the way I see it.<p>Sorry for my primitive English :)",1190850467

""Hypothesis: every boom, ever, leaves behind an infrastructure for steady, above-average growth in some other industry""<p>Have you considered the tulip boom that happened in the Netherlands in the 1600s?  I'd be curios to find out what industry that helped after it collapsed?<p>In any case, I doubt that this thesis holds for housing.",1190850207

60055,comment,60048,60048,0,0,rms,,,"It seems like sentiment is slowly shifting away from PHP hatred as more people that understand good programming practice start or return to PHP for whatever reason. PHP lets you use whatever code you want in combination with html and doesn't force you to use the MVC paradigm. As long as you stick to the MVC architectural pattern, you should be fine.",1190848327

60053,comment,60032,60032,0,0,karzeem,,,"Journalists loves lists, and they can be fun to read, but this doesn't have much value for people trying to predict the future.  Let us not forget the oft-quoted words of His Eminence Alan Kay: ""The best way to predict the future is to invent it.""<p>The fact is that web 3.0 (<i>shudders in self-loathing at having used the term</i>) doesn't exist yet.  If you could see the future, it would be blank.  In 1998, web search wasn't the future.  Google made it the future.  If we don't already know what the future holds, it's no use predicting it--it won't exist until a company comes along and tells us what it is.  For the more ambitious among us, that's the role we're looking to play when we start a company--not to predict the future, but to define it.",1190848230

1. The cliche: Targeted advertising. Having adds based on your goals makes a lot of sense if the ads can get enough context to be relevant.
2. Let people pool prize money. The person who reaches the goal wins the pot. My company would take a small fraction of the prize. I don't know where this would take the company though. Would the company have to be a bank? Would it fall under gambling laws? What are the complications of holding things in what could be viewed as mini-escrow? This path is probably more complicated.",1190848080

It's going to speak SQL because that's what everyone is used to, but I've long entertained the idea of designing something nicer to work with and supporting it as an alternate frontend for the query compiler.  If you have good ideas about how to do this, and think you're capable of implementing them, then please do send me a resume.",1190847944

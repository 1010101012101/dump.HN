One of early books of Victor Pelevin describes &quot;a problem&quot; one avid player of F-19 had because he played too much.<p>Some players still remember that F-19 had an interesting &quot;unreal&quot; bug, which allowed to fly without fuel arbitrarily long (and quite slow). Upside down. It was possible to start playing the first mission (say, Russian North) ranking as lieutenant and land the first time in the highest possible rank with all imaginable awards. F-19 was, in a sense, interesting enough to be remembered.",1405612799

For example, my midi usb keyboard connects to the ipad without any drivers. My camera connects to the surface and shows up as a usb drive without any drivers.<p>The last time I manually downloaded a third party driver (not part of a vetted distribution) was to use up the last ounce of performance for a video game on a pc rig, in 2011.<p>So if device drivers are now part of the OS burden, they are  at the cost of the os provider; and as such, how are the abundance of unmaintained- semi-maintained pieces of code derived from winDDK samples floating around an advantage?<p>Thanks for reading this far, I&#x27;m really interested in this discussion!

It&#x27;s incredibly deep and complex, never ceases to surprise me, has unbelievably versatile multi-player options, and requires constant creativity to come up with winning strategies. One of the great features of this game is that the points earned in-game can be spent in any shop in exchange for goods and services. For example, you could earn £5000 points in-game and, after paying tax (one of the more annoying features - who asked for that?) you can spend that at the Apple Store to buy a spanking new computer. How cool is that?<p>There are all sorts of scenarios available, and depending on your starting resources and chosen strategy the game can provide a vastly different feel. It&#x27;s really good, I recommend it.<p>One big downside compared to traditional 4X games, though, is you&#x27;re never really in control of anything. So if you really crave that sense of control that you get from having a well-organised empire and steamrolling over your opposition in the controlled environment of Civ-like games then you will want to go back to the traditional computer-based versions from time to time.",1405612325

For example:<p>Most requests for our returning vets come from transportation and trade (we&#x27;re a river town relatively close to major north/south and east/west highways and a major railway line). The largest portion of our returning vets were in the army or army national guard, in the local transportation groups. We don&#x27;t have infantry in our area, we have truck drivers and mechanics. Anyway, the requests and the expertise seemed a custom fit - the soldiers ran big trucks and trains, and there is no better organization than the United States Army when it comes to large-scale logistics.<p>Our returning vets, though, are unable to branch outside of their assigned mode of operation.<p>The mechanics are able to work on, say, heavy machines and diesel engines so they&#x27;re able to work on the trains and barges really well, but are unable to translate those skills to tractor trailers or small(ish) engines like pick-ups or delivery vans.<p>The Army transport drivers are able to drive tractor trailers or operate barges. BUT, they do not have the certifications necessary to legally do that work stateside, AND they lack  skills in the classroom to be able to sit and pass the test for the licenses. Usually it&#x27;s because they have never been able to do math well, and are unable to pass a college level mathematics course (it&#x27;s applied math, so it has practical applications in their jobs - not college algebra or statistics or anything like that). Along with that, they&#x27;re unable to translate their existing skills into heavy machinery for construction, demolition or excavation.<p>The leaders/officers are unable to transition out of the military &#x27;because I said so&#x27; mentality and into the corporate &#x27;because it&#x27;s in your best interest&#x27; mentality.

(I also assume you are not my downvoter:-)<p>I see the value of replacing the NT kernel by a bsd variant as this: you free ride on a lot of work done by other people. Us software heads have decided we wanted the hard core kernel and compiler engineering to be open source, circa 1990. We&#x27;ve won philosophically, albeit we&#x27;ve lost economically, as the 18000 layoffs and the death of SUN, and transformation of IBM into a services company, etc. The best compilers out there are open source. The best language innovations are open source.<p>I&#x27;ve nothing against C# and VS, which I consider a very good well documented and better alternative to Java (which is itself loosing ground to javascript in terms of a glue language), and a wonderful IDE respectively; but I wont pay for either, as I will not pay or lock myself in MSSQL when postgres is superior and free. Dont get me wrong, I love MS, I&#x27;ve written code on their tools since MS VC++ 5. (circa 1995)<p>Besides that time when they did not stick to the C++ standard with the STL (was it in VSC++6 or the first .net edition? that one was painful for a while) I&#x27;ve always respected their compilers -- bug free and fast, and producing fast code. It&#x27;s just that there is not value in keeping that closed source anymore, it&#x27;s a cost, when the alternatives are all copying each other easily because the underlying kernels are close cousins.<p>So in my view MS is basically keeping this huge maintenance burden on it&#x27;s own, with a shrinking overall install base percentage based of computing devices (combination of tablets phones pcs etc)",1405611507

If we can hardly expect a full time minimum wage job to support someone, how can a third of that be enough to support &quot;crazy drug addicts&quot; who if anything need more help?<p>Furthermore, if there are 1 million people in San Fran and the city spends $150 million a year, that means everyone is paying in $150.  Which is a lot of money to the poorer end of the spectrum, but chump change to us techies.  Indeed, there are 37,000 tech workers in San Fran who make on average $160,000 [1].  Even if the entirety of the social programs were paid for by tech workers, it&#x27;d come down to 4% of their after tax income [2].  Indeed, to pay for the equivalent of a full time minimum wage job for all of San Francisco&#x27;s homeless would only cost its tech workers 16% of their post-tax salary, or about $10K [3][4].  And that&#x27;s tech workers in the city alone, which make up just 3.7% of its million inhabitants.<p>If you are not a tech worker and are not in a position to do more then please realize this rant is not about you.  For everyone else who just wants to see the problem &#x27;disappear&#x27;, I completely understand why a portion of the city hates you.  You don&#x27;t need a tv, or a new car (used is a smarter choice economically anyways), or a daily latte.  You want those things.  They are nice perks, just like the free lunch at work.  In the meantime the people who are struggling with the lifelong problems of homelessness and addiction are just trying to find a lil hit of crack and a spot by the freeway to get through the day.<p>Some side notes: There will always be the homeless-by-choice, which is fine.  If you want to camp under a bridge all summer go for it.  But there needs to be an available bed and a warm cup of soup waiting for the people who actually have problems, temporarily or long term.<p>[0]: 34 / 10.74 = 3.16 (minimum wage equivalent hours of homeless person&#x27;s benefits)<p>[1]: bottom of <a href=""http://www.sfexaminer.com/sanfrancisco/tech-job-growth-is-booming-but-other-industries-still-dominate-san-francisco/Content?oid=2629996"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sfexaminer.com/sanfrancisco/tech-job-growth-is-bo...</a><p>[2]: 150,000,000 / (37,000 * 160,000 * .4) = .04 (percent of tech worker salary to pay existing homeless budget)<p>[3]: 10.74 * 8 = 86.08 (daily income for minimum wage job)<p>[4]: 150,000,000 * (86.08 / 34) / (37,000 * 160,000 * .4) = .16 (percent of tech worker salary to pay &#x27;full time minimum wage homeless budget&#x27;)",1405611428

The contribution of the work is typically not new <i>knowledge</i>, but a <i>thing</i> - a system, a technique, an algorithm, a language, a framework, etc. So the conclusions in CS papers tend to be &quot;We presented a <i>foo</i> for a <i>blah blah blah</i>.&quot; I joke that conclusions in CS papers are mostly vestigial, and exist only because they&#x27;re expected to exist. (Please note that this bothers me, and I <i>try</i> to include actual conclusions in my papers, which will take the form of general principles we can learn from this new technique or system that we&#x27;re presenting. But such discussion is not <i>needed</i>, and is often cut due to space limitations.) So, skip the conclusions sections in CS papers.<p>The introduction can also usually be skipped, if it&#x27;s an area that you are already familiar with. CS papers tend to have to tell a &quot;story&quot;, and the introduction sets the scene for why the work is relevant and who cares about this sort of thing. These introductions can start out very broad and general, trying to motivate the work from larger trends in industry and society. (Yes, even CS systems papers will appeal to larger trends in society to motivate their work. There are a lot of CS systems papers which will appeal to the prevalence of, say, online social networks to motivate their work on the systems required to support such things. Such as graph processing or real time data management.)<p>If you are familiar with the field, you can typically skip all this. You already know it. Please note that introductions are great if it&#x27;s a field you&#x27;re not as familiar with.<p>A CS systems paper typically has the structure similar to: 1. Introduction; 2. Background; 3. Design; 4. Results; 5. Related Work; 6. Conclusions.<p>If I want to quickly assess if a CS paper is worth my time, I typically read the title, the abstract and then skim the Design section and skim the Results section. (Of course, if it&#x27;s my field, I often can&#x27;t resist just skipping to the Related Work to see if they cited me.)<p>If the paper passes my first look, then I&#x27;ll typically start by reading the Design. If I hit any difficulty in understanding the Design section, then I&#x27;ll jump back to the beginning to get the proper context. I don&#x27;t bother reading the Results section until I understand what they did, and think it&#x27;s reasonable. (If your Design section tells me how you implemented the best 3-wheel car in the world, I&#x27;m not going to bother reading your Results. I don&#x27;t care to try to reason about the performance of your 3-wheel car, because 4-wheel cars exist - unless you can convince me of situations where 4-wheel cars are not an option. That&#x27;s a hard sell, though.)",1405611117

8048037,comment,8042618,8047430,1,0,graycat,,,"> But I don&#x27;t imagine literal boys would pick up a for-dummies book on the opposite sex).<p>I would have jumped at such a book when I was 15 and trying to understand my girlfriend of 13.<p>First lessons:  She has a LOT of deep concerns about her life and family; e.g., is she pretty enough; some of these concerns are strong enough to be anxieties.  From these concerns, she has low self-esteem.  She is just painfully lonely and desperate for friendship, approval, emotional security, not feeling alone, and maybe romance.  She has raging emotions, likely including about sex and romantic relationships, and, thus, is terrified about her &#x27;reputation&#x27;, getting hurt emotionally, and maybe about getting pregnant.  You need to understand her and respond to her, to give her what you can of what she needs.<p>So, need to think a lot about how she has been behaving, what she has been saying or not saying, etc., guess what is going on, get into some non-stressful conversations that can shed more light, understand her, and then help her.<p>In simple terms, yes, not much of a surprise, she is &#x27;needy&#x27;; it&#x27;s easy to suspect that Mother Nature finds that this has &#x27;reproductive advantage&#x27; and likes it.<p>But after school you want to take her for an ice cream cone, hold her hand, if only by some subtle means let her know you think that she is really terrific, and see her smile.  For making her smile, with the right feelings for her, you might like her smiles so much you suspect you could give up food and water and live just on her smiles.<p>After the ice cream cone, hidden behind a tree, you might kiss her six times on her forehead.  That afternoon will be burned into your brain, and for the rest of your life you will no more be able to forget it or her than you could forget your own name.<p>Not many boys of 15 know these things, and they very much need to, these things and many more, before picking a wife or having children, especially daughters.<p>> It&#x27;s also become in vogue to regard boys as psychologically and emotionally stunted, compared to girls. The title just seemed to hint toward that trend.<p>Sorry, but &quot;in vogue&quot; or not, once with an expert I told him that it seemed that women were so darned emotional.  Then right away the expert explained, &quot;Of COURSE women are MUCH more emotional than men.  That is the cause of all the problems.&quot;.  He was both very much an expert and not joking at all.  Also read some of D. Tannen that I referenced.  Or read some of E. Fromm where he says, &quot;Men and women deserve equal respect as persons but are not the same.&quot;.  Look up the recent study I mentioned that showed that in the crib girls are interested in people and boys, in things.  Be around some children and just observe, even in a grocery store:  The girls will make eye contact, and the boys will play with things.  YMMV, and I don&#x27;t have more careful scientific evidence for you, but it would be a radical claim that boys and girls are the same &#x27;socially&#x27; and &#x27;psychologically&#x27;.<p>The norms are common in movies:  E.g., watch &#x27;Back to School&#x27; and look at the girl:  She is socially insightful, &#x27;understanding&#x27; (in the sense of forgiving), sympathetic, empathetic, emotionally supportive, a peacemaker, etc.<p>> And women&#x27;s higher social/emotional intelligence doesn&#x27;t seem to help them in their relations towards men.<p>No, that &#x27;EI&#x27; is just crucial for both girls and women; other than physical beauty (quickly fades?), physical love making, and motherhood, it&#x27;s a lot of all the rest they have &quot;in their relations towards men&quot; and, really, one of the crucial ways they have to keep &#x27;him&#x27; happy &quot;&#x27;till death do we part&quot;.<p>But, yes, still women do have big problems.  My proposed book, if not just a joke to illustrate the need for such a book, would be intended to help.<p>An old but common joke is that girls, girlfriends, and wives don&#x27;t come with an instruction manual.  I believe that boys and men need one.",1405610859

The is effectively a version number. Change this, and get a new password for only that door_id.\n  * Character set\n  * Length\n</code></pre>\nThis file, although not advisable, is not enough to break the other passwords generated.

8047914,story,,,2,1,VincentDaniels,"Fighting CANCER with Boxing and Bodybuilding: How this an beats death everyday",,"The short documentary film, &quot;To Be Strong&quot; (www.ToBeStrongfilm.com) chronicles the struggles of Anthony Daniels, a 22-year-old man from Ridgewood, New Jersey, who is battling Lymphoma for the third time. Daniels is currently in search of a &#x27;ten-out-of-ten&#x27; or perfect bone marrow match for a transplant that would ultimately save his life. His condition is so rare that in the registry of some 20 million people not one match has been found thus far. The ultimate goal for the film, &quot;To Be Strong,&quot; is not only to find Daniels his perfect match, but also to inspire other individuals who may be going through their own battle with cancer.<p>The film depicts Daniels&#x27; unique and rather unorthodox way of fighting his illness. As he undergoes numerous cancer treatments that drain his mind and body, he trains in boxing and weightlifting. He goes to chemotherapy in the morning and when he is finished with his treatment, heads straight to the gym to start boxing. Daniels uses the power of positive thinking and physical exercise to fight off his illness. As he defies the odds, his doctors look on in disbelief. It&#x27;s been three years now, and according to medical science, Daniels isn&#x27;t supposed to still be alive.\nWATCH TODAY AT: WWW.ToBeStrongFilm.com !<p><p>Anthony Daniels\nInstragram: @Anthonydaniels_\nTwitter: @Anthonydans10<p>Vincent Daniels\nInstagram: VincentDaniels_\nTwitter: VincentDaniels_<p>Ken Spooner\nInstagram: @SpoonyStudios\nTwitter: @Kenspooner<p>Mike O&#x27;Brien\nInstagram: @obfilms\nTwitter: @obfilms",1405609518

They add product lines through acquisition, in preference to building internally (if you&#x27;re on a Cisco team and you&#x27;re ever given an MRD for a product, the joke goes, quit and start a company to do it instead). As often as not, Google acquires companies to absorb the people. Google typically buys much smaller companies, and more selectively.<p>I would be very surprised to discover that Google has acquired close to as many headcount as Cisco has.

The author points it can be used ""for your bitcoin mining needs"".<p>I couldn't find which model of Spartan6 it is exactly. However if it is an LX150 (the one with the most logic units, used by the entire Bitcoin community), there is no way he can fit a decent heatsink for proper thermal dissipation. A typical mining implementation generates so much heat that heatsinks this big need to be used (actual picture of one of the first dual-LX150 boards built specifically for mining):

4927013,comment,4925836,4926884,1,0,davidkatz,,,"I understand. Generally, we should aim to build tools that address the greatest gaps in quality. You might say that design is currently not the most important gap to address, and that may be, although it hasn't been my experience. Although design has been getting a lot of attention in recent years, the tools for design are still very much in their infancy.<p>If you contrast the availability of design tools to say, development tools, I'm pretty sure you'll agree there's a huge gap there. I grant that there has been a recent surge in UX/sketching tools, but so many areas of design are still left untouched. Recently, for example, I was very excited by discovering <a href=""http://macrabbit.com/slicy/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://macrabbit.com/slicy/</a> and <a href=""http://iconfactory.com/software/xscope"" rel=""nofollow"">http://iconfactory.com/software/xscope</a> - both solve problems many designers have, and they both make my designer life so much easier.<p>Perhaps to return to your original point - the world is full of people who follow trends blindly. I run an app development company, and if I had a nickel for every time someone asked me to build an app that no one needs, well, you know the end of that saying. Still, if you're going to follow trends without good thinking, 'invest in design' is by far not the worst you could follow.",1355623165

It's ok to hear a joke and tell it to your friend. But technology is basically augmenting our mental capabilities. A smartphone with a camera is a device that lets you remember images better than your brain can - if our brains could already do it, we wouldn't need the smartphone.<p>It happens that the smartphone is external to your brain, but over time, we might add that functionality to your glasses (which is closer), then maybe to your eye sockets or cornea, or eventually integrate it directly with your brain.<p>At which point, laws preventing you from copying things are basically laws that force you to limit the capabilities of human beings.<p>Current copyright law is based on human limitations - humans are bad at remembering verbatim entire books, so we have copyright laws for that. We don't have copyright laws for short jokes because we can remember those. But that framework of law stands in opposition to actually improving human capabilities.

4926968,comment,4923914,4925311,4,0,rpm4321,,,"First of all, I would strongly encourage anyone who is interested to check out Kurzweil's 2009 predictions in his 1999 book Age of Spiritual Machines, rather than this Wikipedia synopsis. It puts his predictions in a much more accurate context. You can view much of it here: <a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=ldAGcyh0bkUC&pg=PA789&source=gbs_toc_r&cad=3#v=onepage&q&f=false"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.com/books?id=ldAGcyh0bkUC&pg=PA789&#...</a><p>Kurzweil also does a reasonably unbiased job of grading his own predictions here: <a href=""http://www.kurzweilai.net/images/How-My-Predictions-Are-Faring.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kurzweilai.net/images/How-My-Predictions-Are-Fari...</a><p>Quite a few of your statements relate to technological adoption vs. technological capability, such as everyday use of speech recognition and ebooks. I <i>clearly</i> stated that Kurzweil is not perfect at predicting what technologies will catch on with consumers and organizations, nor is anyone for that matter. To me, and to most of the people reading this, the most interesting aspect of Kurzweil's predictions is always what technological capabilities will be possible, rather than the rate of technological adoption.<p>Some of your other statements conflate science fiction with what Kurzweil does: <i>""There have been predictions of self-driving cars for more than half a century. It's in Disney's 'Magic Highway' from 1958, for example.""</i> Similarly, most of your other points attempt to make the case that because nascent research projects existed, all of his predictions should have been readily apparent. I'm sorry, but this is pretty much the same hindsight bias displayed by gavanwoolery and Kurzweil's worst critics. Basically, Kurzweil's predictions are incredulously absurd to you, until they become blindingly obvious.<p>You can point to obscure German R&D projects all you want (and who knows how advanced that prototype was, or how controlled the tests were), but I was blown away by the Google self driving car, as were most of the people on HN based on the enthusiasm it received here. I thought it would take at least a decade or so before people took it for granted, buy you've set a Wow-to-Meh record in under a year.<p>Once again, I strongly encourage you to fire up Youtube or dust off an old computer, and really try and remember <i>exactly</i> what the tech environment was <i>really</i> like in previous decades for the average consumer. Zip drives, massive boot times, 5 1/4 floppy disks, EGA, 20mb external hard drives the size of a shoe box, 30 minute downloads for a single mp3 file, $2,000 brick phones, jpgs loading up one line of pixels a second, etc.<p>To be clear, I'm not a Kurzweil fanboy. He's not some omniscient oracle, bringing down the future on stone tablets from the mount. What he is is a meticulous, thoughtful, and voracious researcher of technological R&D and trends, and a reasonably competent communicator of his findings. I'm very familiar with the track records of others who try and pull off a similar feat, and he's not perfect, but he's far and away the best barometer out there for the macro trends of the tech industry. If his findings were so obvious, why is everyone else so miserable at it? Furthermore, his 1999 book was greeted with the same skepticism and incredulity that all of his later books were.<p>For some of your other points, I've included links below:<p><i>Research has been initiated on reverse engineering the brain</i> - Kurzweil was clearly talking about an undertaking like the Blue Brain project. Henry Markram, the head of the project, is predicting that around 2020 they will have reverse engineered and simulated the human brain down to the molecular level:<p><a href=""http://www.ted.com/talks/henry_markram_supercomputing_the_brain_s_secrets.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ted.com/talks/henry_markram_supercomputing_the_br...</a><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Brain_Project"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Brain_Project</a><p><i>A 1000 dollar pc can perform about a trillion calculations per second. -- This happened.

And, in terms of understanding a 1975 comment with 2012 language comparisons, I challenge you to do better.<p>As for Java, it, like COBOL, was intentionally designed from the start to subtly restrict programmers so that large groups could work together on extremely portable programs.  Both became popular in lots of ""boring business applications"" that will live forever.  And if you think that current opinions about Java are dissimilar from old opinions about COBOL, you need to get out of your echo chamber and learn what adherents of various scripting languages think about Java.  If you're tempted to retort that there are more Java programmers than scripting programmers, and Java programmers like the language, a 1975 COBOL programmer could justifiably have said the same thing.<p>The Perl vs PL/I comparison is not original to me.  A bit over a decade ago MJD took a 1967 description of PL/I, did word substitution, and came up with <a href=""http://perl.plover.com/perl67.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://perl.plover.com/perl67.html</a>.  The description fits - both languages combined several previous ones in an idiosyncratic way, with a strong emphasis on making it easy to get stuff done.  The result in both cases was a language which made it easy for ""sysadmin types"" to solve real problems, with solutions that in time could become problems of their own.<p>The FORTRAN to C comparison is, admittedly, unfair as languages.  But both have the characteristic of being low-level languages that are not (by current standards) very expressive, with large established code bases, riddled with repetitive mistakes that cause problems.<p>You admit that BASIC to PHP is better.  If you think that I have failed to give the PHP language, core library, and community the full iota of respect that they deserve, then I likewise believe that you fail to give Kemeny and Kurtz full respect for deciding in the early 60s that computing was going to be a universal right, and there needed to be a programming language, for non-programmers, that would let them unleash that potential.

One of his more contentious claims is that most computing scientists who wrote programs (note the ""computing"", not computer[1]) should use formal methods in addition to programming. In many cases this would mean proving your programs correct. In this sense you are not simply a ""code monkey,"" you are a mathematician generating proofs of algorithmic analysis.<p>Now, of course, he was correct that this is quite difficult, especially if you want to do it for everything. It turns out that the demand for programs which sometimes work is higher than the demand for programs which always work, so most programmers are not mathematicians.<p>However, many of Dijkstra's feelings are being revisited, with a modern twist. The C security disasters of the latter part of the previous century convinced a lot of people that we have become far to lax in our discipline.<p>However, we still recognize that formal proofs of correctness are far too onerous for ordinary programmers. Instead, we'd like to offer the benefits of formal analysis to programmers without any experience with formal analysis. This is the study of type systems.<p>I could go on, but this is a long topic that I really just need to sit down and write a blog post about to cover in any sufficient detail.<p>[1] Computer science is not the study of computers, it's the study of computing",1355619939

(Another way to ask this question would be, which subforum at bikeforums would be interested in this?[1]) I fit into the commuting, road biking, touring, and classic bikes sections, and want no part of this product.<p>As a 30 mile a day bike commuter, I want relatively few failure points as possible in my machine since I don't want my shifters to go bonkers on me as I'm going home at 9pm in sub 40 degrees weather (I'm going to be replacing my STI shifters with barend shifters soon). If I were a city commuter, I'd probably going for a simple fixed gear or similar set up, and certainly don't want a bike that would be a magnet for thieves. As either type of commuter, this component is out of my price range.<p>As a road race style cyclist, my front derailer is of high enough quality that I have literally <i>zero</i> problems shifting from small ring to big ring or vice versa. I never have a situation where I need to shift the front gear while stationary, since any adjustment I need will be small enough to be covered by moving up or down in the cassette. Thus the ""shift front gear while stationary"" benefit is a moot point for me. As for weight, the Shimano Dura Ace components that you'd go up against don't add up to 1kg when looking at crankset + BB cup + front derailer [2], so I don't really see a weight advantage either.<p>If I'm on a tour, there is <i>no</i> way I want a complex gear system that can break down and leave me stranded. I'm going to go for a barend or downtube shifter setup.<p>As a classic bike aficionado, I have negative interest in this product.<p>That being said, jrockway has a good point that this may come in handy for mountain biking because of the mud issue, or cyclocross for similar reasons. Maybe these segments could make sense for this product?<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.bikeforums.net/forum.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bikeforums.net/forum.php</a>

I think Dijkstra's great reputation and 37 years of experience with programming are basically enough for anyone reading this today to take all of his statements as basically true; but if someone published a similar list dissing all your favorite programming languages... well, we've all witnessed internet flame wars.<p>The basic problem here is that the list is nothing but assertions.  Dijkstra is 'right' about almost all of them, but there's no proof, or attempt to argue the point here.  If you didn't already agree with him, or god forbid, actually use one of the languages, what you'd hear is Dijkstra basically saying  you are stupid for using that language.<p>And humans have a very natural tendency when someone calls them stupid to assert angrily that they are not.  And then the argument basically becomes a form of ""no I'm not stupid for liking Apple products, you're stupid for liking Android.""  Which is entirely not the point of what Dijkstra is doing.<p>In my experience, the best way to get someone to change their mind is to show them a better way, and show them how and why it is better without ever insulting the old way or implying people who follow it are stupid.<p>Easier said than done, of course.  But the insults are unnecessary and, more importantly, distracting.  They tend to be more about the ego of the person hurling them than anything else.  And stuff is already hard enough to figure out even without egos getting involved.",1355619669

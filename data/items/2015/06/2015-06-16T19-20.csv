9728346,comment,9725311,9727923,0,0,msandford,,,"Yeah, you&#x27;re right!  So I guess there are maybe three (or four) data sets?<p>1.  the actual truth (rape or not rape)<p>2.  what a prosecutor decides to prosecute (reasonably provable case versus not provable case)<p>3.  what is claimed by the accuser (this is always rape, else there is no accusation)<p>4.  what is not claimed by a could-be accuser (a person who gets raped but doesn&#x27;t report it)<p>In order to get a conviction you need someone from set 3 and set 2.  That completely neglects set 4 and should have some correlation with set 1, but this correlation probably isn&#x27;t going to be amazing because there are both false positives (people who claim to have been raped, but were not) and false negatives (rapes which did happen, but that go unreported or unprosecuted).<p>What really sucks about everything surrounding this particular category of crime is that unlike many other crimes, there&#x27;s a lot of possibility (not necessarily probability though!) for false accusations.  I don&#x27;t honestly know what the underlying probabilities are, and in fact they might well be unknowable.<p>As an engineer the idea that you can&#x27;t even measure the error to figure out how well the system is performing at its job is deeply troubling.  I certainly HOPE that the error rate is low and that innocents are being jailed and criminals aren&#x27;t walking freely.  But keeping up with the news certainly causes me to have some doubt that the error rate is truly low.  I&#x27;m not saying that there&#x27;s a pandemic of false accusations or a pandemic of unprosecuted criminals.  But it&#x27;s hard to hear about a few high profile accusations gone wrong (Duke, mattress girl, etc) and not wonder.<p>Anyhow thanks for pointing out the contradiction in my post!",1434484687

Aside from the normal complaints (it&#x27;s sloooww, undo doesn&#x27;t affect markers or selections), one thing that struck me is that markers can&#x27;t be zero-width. Well, they can but they won&#x27;t show up. I&#x27;m wondering if this is related to the technique mentioned here - it&#x27;s certainly been a pain to work around.

First of all, there are 7Bn people on the planet, and many languages have a small number of speakers.  Loosely, today, less technology, the more languages (because there is less intercommunication).  What we call France used to have hundreds of not-particularly-mutually-comprehensible languages until the Louis XIII and XIV made a point of eliminating them -- but it took the television to pull it off.  Likewise, incomprehensible English dialects survived well into the 20th century.<p>In India there are <i>dozens</i> of languages that have never had a written form that gain an alphabet each year.<p>BTW What&#x27;s a &quot;language&quot; and what&#x27;s a &quot;dialect&quot; is a very political issue.  It was said in the 1800s that you could walk from Paris to Rome, with each village speaking a dialect that its neighbors could understand, but by the time you arrived you&#x27;d gone from French-speaking Paris to Italian-speaking Rome.  Also, politically, there is one &quot;Chinese&quot; language with other Chinese languages called &quot;dialects.&quot;  As a kid I heard Mandarin and Cantonese daily, and never would have called them the same languages, but I had neighbors who would have virulently argued the opposite.",1434484629

You get all the advantages of nginx (unmatched speed and resource efficiency) along with the ability to &quot;inject&quot; lua code into it&#x27;s event loop. Which should be a compelling enough reason for you to give it at least some serious thought.<p>As far as organization of code is concerned openresty does not impose any restrictions on you.

  publication comments amounting to hate speech and speech inciting violence and to ensure a

AFAIK, quiet does (or should do) nothing other than disable some of the kernel logging.<p>> Having a global &quot;debug&quot; knob would have been useful when one does not know if the problme lies in the ramdisk, plymouth, systemd, udev, lvm, whatever. Having a systemd-specific flag defeats that purpose.<p>Yes, and it would have been very useful if the systemd team had offered to implement such a feature, instead of silently pretending to have it.<p>That thing was news to everyone. Except Kay Sievers, apparently, who chose to share the big news with the world when closing the bug report.<p>> The kernel command line, readable from procfs, has been used for this purpose (see the &quot;quiet&quot; flag) for a very long time now.<p>By what non-broken programs? There&#x27;s no reason to even assume procfs will always be there, let alone that the kernel will expose its boot parameters through it. AFAIK, quiet doesn&#x27;t affect anything but the kernel&#x27;s logging.<p>With obvious exceptions (e.g kernel debugging tools and the like), that shouldn&#x27;t happen.<p>> It worked perfectly on every system until the kernel bug triggered the feedback loop.<p>No no. It worked perfectly because the systemd team never bothered to see what happens when the kernel actually tries to use the debug flag, too (i.e. when an assertion actually fires). It should be obvious to anyone who&#x27;s been programming for more than an year or so that, when you start parsing arguments that aren&#x27;t yours (which is bad enough in the first place!) you should at least ensure that you don&#x27;t break the program that uses it.<p>Yes, the rate limit for /dev/kmsg was increased when it turned out there <i>was</i> a potential to incapacitate the system by flooding the kernel with data from userspace. For what it&#x27;s worth, if a program did that on Windows, every half-assed heuristic detection engine would have promptly flagged it as malware.<p>> It was &quot;expected behaviour&quot; in the presence of a kernel bug, which is why it was obviously not generally &quot;expected behaviour&quot; as you seem to imply.<p>How the hell is &quot;I&#x27;m passing an argument to the kernel and a program from userspace decides to interpret it&quot; expected behaviour? If I pass rw, too, should I now expect mount to mount <i>every</i> system as read-write?",1434484533

San Francisco<p>If you are wondering how your magical skill-set in data analytics can create tremendous value in a hundred billion dollar industry, this is your answer!<p>We are a team of MIT grads and Y Combinator alum. We are building a pillar platform that aggregates the businesses&#x27;s data in the parking industry to eventually solve the notorious parking searching problem. To start with, we provide a SaaS solution that collects, analyzes, and visualizes data for parking businesses to help them significantly improve their business performances. This is an industry that generates hundreds of billion dollars a year worldwide, but still mostly uses paper and Excel to analyze their business data. We clean and structure the raw data, then apply machine learning and optimization techniques to predict occupancy rates over time. Using predictions, we dynamically lower prices to increase the utilization rates of parking spaces. It helps garage owners make more money and help customers find parking more easily at the same time.<p>We are eager to meet you if you are:
- A firm believer of the value of data analytics in traditional industries, and obsessed to use math to solve real-world problems; 
- A data guru who can quickly parse, manipulate, and analyze data from multiple sources and formats; 
- Proficient in Python. Experience with Python analytics libraries (numpy, pandas, etc.) is a big plus;

Want to use your design skills to bring a $30 billion industry (USA) into a new age? Smarking welcomes you!
We are a team of MIT PhDs and Y Combinator alumni that collect, analyze, and visualize real-time data for parking businesses. The parking industry generates $30 billion in revenue a year in the US alone, but still uses paper and Excel spreadsheets to analyze their data. This leads to bad customer service, and millions in untapped revenue.
Starting from messy raw data, we produce beautiful charts and dashboards for parking managers to help better understand their operations in real time. We also visualize data for parking customers to help match the supply and demand.<p>Responsibilities:
- Produce beautiful mock-ups of charts that visualize real-time data, historical data, and predictions 
- Design intuitive user interfaces that make it easy to find aggregated data (e.g. Average occupancy on Saturdays, revenue from people arriving at 5pm, etc.); 
- Work closely with clients and users to understand their needs and blow them away with awesome designs<p>Requirements:
- A strong portfolio that demonstrates your ability to design beautiful user interfaces (e.g. personal website, dribbble, behance, cargo etc). 
- Be self motivated: Have the drive to take charge in projects from the initial client engagement to deployment. 
- Great communication skills: Should be able to effectively articulate your design decisions to both clients and developers. 
- Have a basic foundation in front-end web development (HTML, CSS, Javascript). 
- Experience building mockups using software such as, Illustrator, Photoshop, and Sketch<p>Things that will make you stand out: 
- Advanced front-end development skills and experience with front-end frameworks such as AngularJS and D3.js 
- Extensive experience working with CSS3 animations 
- Able to produce animated mockups using Photoshop or After Effects<p>#4 DevOp Engineer

When judgmental people are prevented by prevailing mores from fully exercising their judgmentalism, their efforts will be concentrated on the unfortunate few who remain acceptable targets. Many judgmental people don&#x27;t like young women to be sexually active (this seems to have been the case for all of recorded history). One can&#x27;t complain <i>directly</i> about that nowadays, however, so one must complain about whoever vile tempters can be blamed, however tenuously, for the sexual activity of young women.<p>A similar phenomenon exists with respect to abortion and infanticide. Once upon a time, we would have been fairly merciful toward young mothers troubled enough to kill their own children. Now, however, our harridan-in-chief Nancy Grace leads the popular crusade to crucify the poor mothers. The reason is that many people feel very uncomfortable about abortion, but have no other acceptable outlet for that discomfort.",1434484148

To the best of my knowledge there is nothing weird about capable people being attracted to a leader who is good at identifying actual problems and is grouchily intolerant of those actual problems attracting capable people. Nor anything weird about such a leader motivating the people who are attracted; nor anything weird about such a leader getting high performance out of the organization. Supposed examples are not exactly scarce in business, military, scientific, sports, and entertainment off the top of my head, and as far as I know they&#x27;re mostly true, not misleading legends. In most cases I only know second-hand, and I could be mistaken or misled. But the most straightforward interpretation of the evidence seems to be that successful doesn&#x27;t-suffer-fools-lightly leadership is a pretty common pattern in sharp results-oriented endeavours.<p>In contrast, it would make much more sense if a sentence like that in a profile ended with &quot;...has managed to be such a supremely effective automobile salesman;&quot; as far as I know retail sales is not full of examples of grouchy doesn&#x27;t-suffer-fools-lightly successes. But managing sharply goal-oriented organizations? Who would think that&#x27;s inconsistent with what&#x27;s reported about Linus here?<p>Even the prima donna antipattern of being a loose cannon who is flakily grouchy can be somewhat consistent with success --- people will put up with irritating inefficient prima donna stuff if there are enough compensating advantages. But I don&#x27;t think the article establishes that&#x27;s what&#x27;s going on, and as far as I know it&#x27;s uncommon for knowledgeable people to think that&#x27;s going on. Success always breeds some level of resentment, and some fraction of people will jump to unusual conclusions, and many thousands of knowledgeable people know of Linus, so I assume there are some knowledgeable people out there who believe that he&#x27;s an unreasonable prima donna. But I can&#x27;t think of any individual to nominate as particularly likely to believe this.",1434484136

There are almost no refugees in Calais from former French colonies. The British empire is not old history, it still shapes people’s lives today. Many people have friends and family already in the UK. Many speak English, which is often the main language taught in school.  There is still the  myth of Britain as the ‘mother of democracy’, a safe haven of human rights. People are keen to start a new life as quickly as possible, so coming to a country where you know the language makes much more sense.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/mar/08/asylum-france-sangatte-immigration-calais"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/mar/08/asylum-france-s...</a><p>[1] <a href=""https://leedsnoborders.wordpress.com/faq-on-migration-asylum-calais/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://leedsnoborders.wordpress.com/faq-on-migration-asylum...</a>",1434483984

9728226,comment,9725199,9727826,0,0,cshimmin,,,"Regarding the Higgs mass, there are two basic camps in particle physics. Some believe the Higgs mass is just a constant of nature (just like the electron mass, or the speed of light), and there&#x27;s nothing &quot;surprising&quot; about it, it&#x27;s just what it is. Others believe that this mass is surprising because of &quot;naturalness&quot; issues -- the idea that this mass should have been more closely related to other fundamental constants, namely the Planck mass. However it is possible to view this suspicion as an aesthetic issue of the underlying mathematical framework (QFT). One of the main motivating features of Supersymmetry is to reconcile this difference by providing a mechanism by which the Higgs mass &quot;naturally&quot; becomes much less than the Planck mass. However many SUSY theories have been tightly constrained by recent experiments, requiring ever more contrived ways to cause this &quot;natural&quot; cancellation for a Higgs at 125 GeV.<p>The oscillation of neutrinos is completely different. In the standard model of particle physics, neutrinos are treated as identically massless. However, experiments have shown that one flavor of neutrino can spontaneously transmute into another flavor. This phenomenon is (as far as we know) only possible if the neutrino has some (albeit tiny) mass. This has been observed extensively by other experiments that showed electron/muon neutrino oscillation, but OPERA is providing a direct measurement of muon->tau neutrino mixing.",1434483254

What I&#x27;ve found is that RDMA is the &quot;easy&quot; part to get right, as it&#x27;s fairly simple. Not every network card is created equal with respect to how many packets it can actually pass through to the kernel however, partially in part to the kernel driver (whether it&#x27;s using NAPI or not, driver efficiency, MSI-X support, interrupt coalescing) and the card itself (onboard buffer, latency characteristics, etc.) 10g cards max out at around 14Mpp/s @ 60 bytes when the kernel is involved and everything is perfectly tuned. Which should be where the card he&#x27;s using falls. A generic onboard Intel card generally maxes out around 8-10Mpp/s.

How would you propose detecting node health without some form of heartbeat?<p>generally there is probably enough traffic between nodes to just run failure detection off of txn failures / normal comms (rpc,etc) without running a separate failure detection mechanism, but this assumes every node is already talking to every node, which is not safe, but let&#x27;s explore solutions to that. detecting failures from normal communication will likely be even faster than a heartbeat, provided traffic frequency is higher than the heartbeat (use case contingent). to get around the issue where all nodes aren&#x27;t already in communication, could broadcast any local failures each node might observe and you save the traffic of the heartbeat in the normal case, a gossip mechanism could work to reduce the N^2&#x27;ness of that communication -- it seems likely that multiple nodes will detect a given failure at around the same time, we don&#x27;t want each of them broadcasting that, potentially leading to more failures from increased net traffic. since the nodes who were in communication with the failed one have detected it, we really just need to update the nodes who weren&#x27;t so that they can find out about it in a closed interval (same guarantee as a heartbeat, potentially looser bounds).<p>maybe this is being too optimistic, but at least it&#x27;s fun to think about :)",1434481864

293519,comment,293150,293408,0,0,cstejerean,,,"It's called building a reputation. If a company consistently does the ""right"" thing, people start to trust it and give it some leeway when it screws up. Unfortunately for Microsoft they have pretty much ruined their reputation as far as I'm concerned (most recent example of a MS screw-up is the OOXML circus).",1220413644
293518,story,,,1,2,SingAlong,"One(actually a couple) thing I noticed in Chrome and felt ugly",,"Mozilla Firefox loyalists(or fans or simply users) will have a small problem if they want to switch to Chrome. A very important option in Mozilla Firefox is inverted in Google Chrome. The ""Open in new tab"" option and ""open in new window"" options that appear during a right click on a link in Firefox have different order in chrome. In firefox the ""open in new window"" appears first and ""open in new tab"" appears second. And in Chrome its the other way. The Chrome way is right. Since users would open pages in new tabs often and its placed first. But I have got so used to Firefox that I just can't stop myself selecting the second option in Chrome and I endup seeing a lot of new windows :)<p>And there's no Google Toolbar to bookmark to my Google Bookmarks (which I would like to do if there are no plugins API for others to develop a Delicious Toolbar)<p>Google can include another option so that pages can be viewed from Google's cached versions when they aren't available.<p>So for now I would wait till Google releases a plugin API, so that others would start developing plugins and then switch to Chrome",1220413471

293509,comment,293355,293355,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Lest anyone get the wrong idea: Perl has very nearly the nicest and most automagic Unicode support of any language I know of--despite this interesting quirk of Encode.pm.  Perl is certainly stronger and more complete than Python, which many consider ""good"" Unicode support.  Ruby doesn't even try, and Lua is about on par with Ruby.  I'm unfamiliar with Java, though I imagine it must have pretty good support, and C# is too new not to have had Unicode from the beginning.<p>It <i>is</i>, perhaps, unfortunate that there are these subtle ways to shoot yourself in the foot in Perl.  It's an accusation that is leveled at the language in reference to more than just Unicode, and not always unfairly.",1220412911

From a productivity standpoint, I think just always using one (probably ack since its output is more readable, though I tend to use grep unless I think, since I haven't been using ack for very long, and ten years of habitual grepping is a habit that dies hard).",1220411813

5297640,comment,5297039,5297039,2,0,dgmistry,,,"I'm working on a project with United Way in NYC that's addressing the data issues around food banks and shelters. We could use some additional tech help.<p>It started after Sandy hit. All of the major charitable organizations would send resources to the areas impacted the hardest. This resulted in over servicing these areas and left about 30% of affected areas without any services at all. Also, people would be directed to food banks and shelters that were full, out of stock, closed for the day, or shut down. While other shelters and food banks remained underutilized. No one had the necessary information to direct these people to the right places.<p>A hackathon yielded some interesting solutions for disaster recovery - one of which was a text message system (data services were unavailable for a while - coincidentally, many homeless people have phones, but not smart phones) to coordinate volunteers and service providers. We've begun to coordinate with many of the largest service providers, non-profits, local government agencies and corporate sponsors on this.<p>There are so many needs of the homeless population that can be addressed by technology. We have no money to contribute, we're a struggling, over-worked, early stage startup, but we've found that even just a few hours a month makes a difference. Entrepreneurs and techs talk poorly of lawyers, but how many hours of pro-bono work do we perform each year? It's not all sexy work, but sometimes just cleaning some data one evening can impact thousands of people.<p>If anyone would like to volunteer for this effort, or initiate a similar effort in their community, please reach out to me: community (at) 42stats.com",1362038291

Moreover, even on a pretty bad 1280x1024 display and in a non-maximized window, I see both of the top paragraphs as well as part of the downloads--enough to know to scroll.<p>For whatever reason, most sites seem to err on having fonts that are far too small. I would much rather they err on having fonts too large, and I do not think this particular page erred at all.<p>Perhaps it doesn't work well on a cell phone or tablet, but it works perfectly fine on any even moderately modern laptop or desktop.<p>As an aside, I really love the GitHub and Twitter icons.

This is a tax form that allows you to save on taxes due to stock grants being treated (at time of vesting) as income. Read about it here: <a href=""http://www.fairmark.com/execcomp/sec83b.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fairmark.com/execcomp/sec83b.htm</a>.

If you don't, do more reading!<p>Above all else, remember that if your startup is pre-revenue, valuations are <i>extremely</i> tricky. Even the valuation of a pre-revenue startup as set by a funding round can be unreliable, since it's essentially a made-up number (made-up by VCs/angel investors). Consider that if even VC's and angel investors barely know what they're doing, imagine how hard it is for employees to properly place a value on their equity. A lot of it comes down to how confident you are in the founders/management of the startup (which is often how investors approach this problem). Hopefully you have worked with the people long enough to get a good handle on how ""determined"" and ""resourceful"" they are.<p>If you have any more questions, see my profile and send me an email (replace the ""|"" with an @)",1362036146

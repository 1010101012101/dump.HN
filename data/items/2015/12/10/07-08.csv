10709450,comment,10707442,10709361,0,0,johncolanduoni,,,"That is the central open question. That&#x27;s what Scott means when he talks about asymptotics, and the conclusion of the Google paper is that we have probable evidence that with enough qubits and a big enough problem it will be faster for a very specific problem compared to a non-optimal classical algorithm (we have ones that are for sure better).<p>This probably sounds like a somewhat useless result (quantum computer beats B-team classical algorithm), but it is in fact interesting because D-Wave&#x27;s computers are designed to perform quantum annealing and they are comparing it to simulated annealing (the somewhat analogous classical algorithm). However they only found evidence of a constant (i.e. one that 4000 qubits wouldn&#x27;t help with) speed up (though a large one) compared to a somewhat better algorithm (Quantum Monte Carlo, which is ironically not a quantum algorithm), and they still can&#x27;t beat an even better classical algorithm (Selby&#x27;s) at all, even in a way that won&#x27;t scale.<p>Scott&#x27;s central thesis is that although it is possible there could be a turning point past 2000 qubits where the D-Wave will beat our best classical alternative, none of the data collected so far suggests that. So it&#x27;s possible that a 4000 qubit D-Wave machine will exhibit this trend, but there is no evidence of it (yet) from examining a 2000 qubit machine. Scott&#x27;s central gripe with D-Wave&#x27;s approach is that they don&#x27;t have any even pie-in-the-sky theoretical reason to expect this to happen, and scaling up quantum computers without breaking the entire process is much harder than for classical computers so making them <i>even bigger</i> doesn&#x27;t seem like a solution. My personal frustration with D-Wave&#x27;s marketing is that the fact that their computers are super specialized often gets lost; these computers fail the equivalent quantum notion of a complete set of digital logic gates.",1449734318

10709445,comment,10705746,10706147,0,0,segphault,,,"Hey, I&#x27;m Ryan from RethinkDB. I wrote the OP blog post and I&#x27;m working on a follow-up that demonstrates how to use the Java driver in various alt-JVM languages.<p>You can take advantage of Clojure&#x27;s Java interop to use the new official Java driver in Clojure, but it doesn&#x27;t offer a very good user experience compared to clj-rethinkdb. It will work for a lot of simple cases, but it gets weird very quickly. When you define a function in Clojure, the underlying Java object is an IFn[0]. Unfortunately, you can&#x27;t pass an IFn to native Java methods that expect to receive a Java 8 lambda (an anonymous class with a single method). You can work around this limitation by manually creating an object that conforms with the client driver&#x27;s various ReqlFunction[1] interfaces, but it&#x27;s not very pretty:<p>This ReQL expression in Java:<p><pre><code>  r.table(&quot;fellowship&quot;).map(x -> x.getField(&quot;name&quot;)).coerceTo(&quot;array&quot;).run(conn)\n</code></pre>\nBecomes this in Clojure:<p><pre><code>  (-> (.table r &quot;fellowship&quot;) (.map (reify com.rethinkdb.gen.ast.ReqlFunction1 (apply [this, x] (.getField x &quot;name&quot;)))) (.coerceTo &quot;array&quot;) (.run conn))\n</code></pre>\nNote the use of reify and the ReqlFunction1 interface. You need to be careful to pick the interface that matches the arity of your anonymous function. For example, if you have four parameters, you use ReqlFunction4 instead of ReqlFunction1.<p>You could probably do some voodoo to abstract away some of the ugliness, but the way that clj-rethinkdb&#x27;s r/fn macro works under the hood and translates into the wire protocol is frankly a lot more elegant than anything you could do with our official client driver and Clojure&#x27;s Java interop IMO. That said, I&#x27;m not particularly well-versed in either Java or Clojure, so there may be something I&#x27;m overlooking. I hope this explanation is helpful to somebody. :-)<p>TL;DR: use clj-rethinkdb if you want to write sane-looking ReQL in Clojure.<p>[0]: <a href=""https://clojure.github.io/clojure/javadoc/clojure/lang/IFn.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://clojure.github.io/clojure/javadoc/clojure/lang/IFn.h...</a>\n[1]: <a href=""https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/blob/next/drivers/java/src/main/java/com/rethinkdb/gen/ast/ReqlFunction1.java"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/blob/next/drivers/jav...</a>",1449734229

10709441,comment,10706202,10706975,0,0,SamReidHughes,,,"If you have that information, you can factor that into your admissions criteria using feedback from previous students.  For example, you could rank incoming students and tweak a racial parameter to equalize the 6-year graduation rate of the bottom decile in each race.  Doing so will (by construction) improve the outcome of your 6-year graduation rate.  Pick whatever is a good proxy for whatever your goals are.<p>That&#x27;s more meritocratic than ignoring that information.<p>There is a different sense of meritocracy though, in which the goals themselves are unmeritocratic.  For example, &quot;educating lots of left-handed people&quot; (to the exclusion of right-handers) is a rather unmeritocratic goal.  The real argument being had is in this respect -- for one, whether educating should be done for students&#x27; benefit or for the sum of others&#x27; benefit.  And also, in the subcategory of &quot;for others&#x27; benefit,&quot; whether making maximally good scientists, historians, and the like, should be the goal, or whether and to what extent there&#x27;s benefit in trying to infiltrate minority communities with a more education-valuing culture.",1449734136

I think you are trying to describe a slippery slope.  Strawman is a fallacy wherein one debater misrepresents the position of another, and then uses this weaker misrepresentation as the basis for a response.  In fact, it&#x27;s exactly what you are doing when you say &quot;oh that&#x27;s easy - the hegemonic empire doesn&#x27;t want its stormtroopers - that would be its population - to die, because they can&#x27;t fight for hte hegemonic empire or pay their taxes&quot; - this is a position I didn&#x27;t take, don&#x27;t hold, and which weakens your position to argue against.  You are talking to a wall.<p>* You say:<p>> I&#x27;m not okay with someone arguing a position that I have to start reading labels on my fruits to make sure I don&#x27;t die.<p>...and I&#x27;m just given pause because it&#x27;s almost like you aren&#x27;t living in the same world as the rest of us.<p>You <i>do</i> need to read labels.  There <i>are</i> poisons in food.  People <i>do</i> die from food - quick, sickening deaths like from e-coli in fast food and, in much greater numbers, slow, miserable deaths from obesity and diabecity.  Do you not realize that these are the main causes of death in our society?  I mean... is it possible that this just hasn&#x27;t occurred to you?  You made direct reference to it in your comment, but the points seems to have been lost on you.<p>So, on one hand, the FDA has failed to stop toxic food from becoming the biggest cause of premature death in society.<p>On the other hand, the FDA, along with its state counterparts, <i>have</i> stopped low-cost, healthy food from entering the food supply and threatening the quasi-monopolies held by a few small, giant corporate agriculture sponsors.<p>To pull out just one example - but you can find more every day across the country - just down the road from where I sit in Michigan: the Michigan Dept. of Agriculture actually forced a farm co-op to dump hundreds of gallons of milk and to destroy over a thousand free-range eggs because they were deemed for &#x27;sale&#x27; instead the property of the co-op:<p><a href=""http://www.wnem.com/story/26116053/farmers-forced-to-dump-produce-for-operating-without-license"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wnem.com/story/26116053/farmers-forced-to-dump-pr...</a><p>I want to give you the benefit of the doubt here; maybe you just didn&#x27;t realize these things were happening.  But it&#x27;s bad.  The food is bad, and it&#x27;s mostly various arms of the government that are making it so.<p>And please, bottle the acid with your stormtroopers bit.  It&#x27;s much simpler than that, of course: it&#x27;s about money.  There&#x27;s no complex shroud of intent here.  Huge agricultural companies pay the government to make their products the only game in town.  It&#x27;s really not much more complicated than that.<p>This is par for the course; there is no example in history of government making the food supply safer, and even less so in the center of empire.  As a habit, empires push unhealthy food and drugs on their own populous and that of their colonies.  This is the basic dynamic of the opium war, of alcohol prohibition, and of drug prohibition today.<p>At the end of the day, I prefer that it be legal for people to sell ridiculous, snake-oily products, even unto properly labeled arsenic apples, then to have to choose between subsidized poison and scarce real food.<p>Arsenic apples are not a threat to food security.  Nobody will even try to sell them.  And if they do, nobody will buy them.  Hill High Dairy being shut down <i>is</i> a threat to food security.<p>These are not hypotheticals; these are the actual choices we have to make about the role, if any, for government to play in assisting adults in securing healthy food.",1449732473

Late 90s the K6x chips were breathing new life into Socket 7 motherboards and existing systems, and a couple years later the Athlon was saving peple a hundred or more dollars to get a system that outperformed the Pentium 4 and produced significantly less heat. This helped them grow their marketshare significantly, which meant when we needed 64bit computing, we had two viable companies to pick from, rather than one giant and one minor also-ran.<p>Intel still acted like they were the market dictator (which they weren&#x27;t at that time) and said &quot;IA64 is the way forward, dump x86!&quot; This was astounding from Intel as for decades they had been the key drummer on the backwards-compatible drum, making sure each new x86 CPU could run the old existing code. Now suddenly they&#x27;re saying dump decades of installed base. AMD took advantage of their increased marketshare and said, &quot;Hey, we have a 64bit solution for x86 that keeps your old code, and lets you create 64bit code for the future without relearning a new, complicated architecture.&quot; IA64 was EPIC, meaning Extremely Parallel Instruction Computing. AMD64 was x86 with a whole new set of 64bit extensions but with x86 compatibility and familiarity, which is exactly what Intel did when they extended x86 into the 32bit world with the i386. Those two factors combined are why AMD64 became the defacto standard. Neither would have helped without the other.",1449731091

Doing the compute-intensive bits in C is in fact expected and encouraged! The same is true in the Tcl camp. Maybe some HLL communities (Java?) like to be ""pure"" but I've not ever encountered that.",1241505471

A genius programmer, maybe 100klines.<p>There's something beyond those figures, though. And it gets worse when a team is involved.<p>The higher the level of the language rises, the less it <i>allows</i> making bad programs, however big the program is.",1241505339
593749,comment,593020,593706,0,0,zio,,,"No. Objective C isn't performance oriented, and while it's fine for most desktop apps (!) it's not in the same league as C++. C++ can actually let you use higher level structures that are faster than in C or Objective C because of template meta programming, as shown in the Blitz template library for numerical computation.<p><a href=""http://www.oonumerics.org/blitz/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.oonumerics.org/blitz/</a>
This is what Templates are made for. And this is what you can't do in something like Java or Objective C. Java Generics boiling down to type cast at run time to and from Object, it doesn't help performance a bit.",1241505305

593742,comment,591217,591533,0,0,grinich,,,"When I said ""best"" this was what I meant. For me, it's the best blend of simplicity and functionality, essentially just being a text editor with a drawer organizer. In nearly all cases, my notes only require basic formatting and are short enough than they don't require searching.<p>For other uses, such as taking clippings, composing blogs posts, and keeping a journal, I'd wholeheartedly reccomend a more powerful app like those suggested in the comments, especially VoodooPad.<p>But now the title has been changed, hiding my blunder of a headline. Any ideas on how this happened?",1241504710

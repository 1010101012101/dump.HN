Handwriting doesn't offer that dual modality approach. Further you could pair typed words with the objects to which they refer (think animals), the sounds they make, and other facts about them. I'm actually shocked there aren't teaching programs like this. There must be that I'm not aware of.",1221475799

304492,comment,304303,304303,0,0,maxklein,,,"There are several billion human beings on earth. There is NO society on earth that relies on marathon running to survive. There are very few societies where people are at all inclined to run for long distances as part of the daily culture.<p>We may have the mechanism to run, but it somehow doesn't really strike me that human beings are made for running marathons. It just seems wrong to me. Marathon running is too taxing for us.<p>What I think happened is that the core human design was not especially built for marathon running. But at the critical point in history where marathon running was very much needed (for example, when the sapiens started expanding), all the marathon runners survived and took over.<p>For example, let's say the earth were suddenly to increase the temperature to 48° for the space of one year. A lot of people will die, but the ones who survive will be the ones that already had the capability to survive that type of heat. So even if the earth ever goes back to normal temperature, all remaining people will be people who can survive at 48° and the descendants of such people. So heat survival will become a new trait of all humans, but it does not mean that we actually need it anymore.<p>So I think that we have this ability because at some evolutionary point, we REALLY needed it. So now we don't need it anymore, but it's still there.",1221474520

One of the properties of this vision is that the ""trust-graphs"" will be decentralized - there will not be a single authoritative trust-rating pr site. (Whether we believe this vision will ever come to fruition is a different issue).<p>> <i>the idea [...] needs to die quickly before repressive governments, and those that nearly are, use his words as an excuse to censor and filter the internet further.</i><p>Yeah right, as if repressive goverments need an excuse from TBL to censor the internet. Anyway, they are certainly not going to wait for the realization of ""the semantic web"" to start censoring.",1221474111

That gave the US a huge leg up. Granted it was subsidising reconstruction in the rest of the world, but that also served to create markets for exporting to.

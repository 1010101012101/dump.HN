I don&#x27;t believe that renting my house to strangers is a smart idea. I don&#x27;t believe that someone who feels like driving people around should take me 35 miles to the airport. There are bad people out there folks. The formality around hotel and cab businesses and the barriers to entry serve to &quot;protect&quot; the consumer somewhat. Since it&#x27;s hard to start a profitable hotel, you want to provide good service to customers and keep things bed bug free. If you paid good money for your cab token you probably wouldn&#x27;t want to rape one of your fares and destroy that investment. Now these are kind of a straw man arguments, but the point I&#x27;m making is just because you can do things doesn&#x27;t mean that you should. I also just think that business models like uber and airbnb can let people into the market that really should not or have no business being there. Of course the odds of something bad happening in a hotel vs airbnb or someone trashing your airbnb are likely very slim. Same goes with über vs cabs. However I would venture to say it&#x27;s a safe bet that in most cases you are more likely to have a bad experience with the &quot;disrupt&quot; businesses than an established and bureaucratic one.<p>I think that it should probably be decided by the market, and I would love to be wrong about this. I just don&#x27;t think that I am. Maybe if I were 10 years younger and didn&#x27;t have kids, but at my current place in life, I&#x27;m calling a cab to take me to a hotel, and I don&#x27;t have house guests that aren&#x27;t really or like family to me.",1395200912

In statistics sigma is used to represent one of two things:<p>- a parameter of a probability distribution, typically one which influences the spread of the distribution<p>- a measure of dispersion in an actual data set, which may be an estimator of a parameter in a probability distribution<p>Neither of those things necessarily involve the Gaussian density.<p>In physics it seems that &quot;sigma values&quot; are used as a scale to measure p-values, so that instead of saying 0.0000003, they can just say 5σ. But the critical point here, which your comments seem to be missing, is that there is no distributional assumption being made; there is no implication that the Normal distribution describes any data-generating process, merely that the probability of an equal or more extreme value of a test statistic under some model, is the same as the probability of observing a value more than 5 standard deviations from the mean under a Gaussian model.",1395200827

Two-factor authentication is there, but not via a popup like on gmail. You have to enter it in the web-form. This is a hassle, because I use LastPass and it&#x27;s a bit fiddly. Further, under Fastmail you create new logins in addition to the master account password. The new logins can have two-factor, but the master can&#x27;t. So there is a small vulnerability in that at least one password without the protection of two-factor.<p>Secondly, the spam filters on Gmail are far better. Fastmail has got a bit better, but it&#x27;s still worse when compared with Google&#x27;s offering.<p>Thirdly, Fastmail costs. While I&#x27;m more than happy to pay, I doubt many people would switch services from a free to paid, just because it appeared to be slightly slower.<p>That said, I really love Fastmail.

While he is remembered more for his paintings than poetry, his poetry carries with it the essence and soul of his paintings as well as the imagery.  He decided to paint with words.  I don&#x27;t think he obsessed about writing all the time.  As he put it, though, &quot;A sonnet is a moment&#x27;s monument.&quot;[1]<p>This gets at what I think is an important point though.  All of these creative endeavors require real-world knowledge.  Hemmingway went out on adventures.  For Tolkein, writing fiction was not his day job (teaching about medieval literature and linguistics, however, was).  You can see their respective works that the live of the writer and the other obsessions beyond writing are what make the author.<p>Similarly with programming, yes, it is a technical endeavor and yes it is a creative one.  However just like writing the great works of fiction, these don&#x27;t come out of nothing.  They require a context grounded in other knowledge and experience.<p>[1] <a href=""http://web.ics.purdue.edu/~felluga/medievalism/areading.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.ics.purdue.edu/~felluga/medievalism/areading.html</a>  Note that this was the introductory sonnet to &quot;The House of Life&quot; which chronicals Rosetti falling in love, getting married, coping with his wife&#x27;s death, and finally finding solace in his religious worldview.  The poem, despite its abstract nature is full of classical Greek imagery and something one could probably write volumes about.  At the same time, it is an exposition on <i>why</i> he wrote poetry, and it provides the framework for fully understanding the hundred or so sonnets in The House of Life in that way.  There are love sonnets, and sonnets which, as he puts it &quot;in Charon&#x27;s palm it pays the toll to Death&quot; (i.e. allowing the dead and the living to begin to move on).",1395199660

Tried to become a boxer to escape crushing poverty but didn&#x27;t have the right build for it. Ended up in construction where he learned to become an electrician.<p>He started a small contracting company doing electrical work on new construction and now has three generations of his family and a few hundred employees working for him.<p>As an aside, he has substantial real estate holdings, raises race horses for a hobby (actually he lets his wife do that), lives on a beautiful 50 acre estate with multiple guest houses and a private car collection spread across half a dozen large garages that&#x27;s got to be seen to be believed and has vacation homes in the places you&#x27;d expect people to have vacation homes. He has a skybox at the local football team stadium etc. He&#x27;s toyed with getting a 100&#x27; yacht, but doesn&#x27;t much like boats.<p>He&#x27;s also completely unknown and if you were to meet him you&#x27;d think he was a retired ex-boxer construction worker -- real blue collar stuff.

His sons and grandkids are all similarly down to earth and work for what they earn and not a one of them would be known outside of the circle they work in. His sons are all at least double digit millionaires, even though they&#x27;ve split the company 3 ways between them.<p>Another family I know, immigrated from Korea, the father opened a small deli (one of those NYC style by-the-pound places) and his sons all grew up in the family business.  The oldest son cottoned onto the family business and grew it, moved it to a better location. He supports his father in a <i>very</i> comfortable retirement, lives in a multi-million dollar 6000 sq ft home in a city next to apartment buildings (so you can guess what the property value might be), his two younger brothers all work at the family business and all live in very comfortable homes. He also has a pretty decent real estate portfolio and is planning on opening up at least 3 other delis in the next 5 years and perhaps building up a brand and franchising them out.

Didn&#x27;t even finish his 6th grade education. He managed to get ahold of some property and some investment money and flipped it and made some money. Repeat a few years, with more expertise, and he made a tidy fortune for himself. He single handedly supported himself, his wife, 5 kids (all through college), his brother and his similarly sized family...without going into too long a story, he vacations half the year out of his retirement and spends the other half playing Golf...in Korea. He also lives in a multi-million dollar, custom architected showpiece house near Seoul.

Unfortunately, the author of the blog post is reading it rather selectively and linking to another report.<p>Reading through the law, it seems largely sensible. The council lays out its logic for which pieces of the operations of a service like Uber need to be regulated, and specifies appropriate regulatory action on each item. We&#x27;re talking about aspects like &quot;transparency of rates&quot;, &quot;certificates of safety&quot; from mechanics, allowances for handicapped people, and insurance.<p>In fact, the council lays out a pilot program to assess whether such regulatory action is actually effective, &quot;so that regulation provides a safety net that the public can rely on for its protection while new businesses innovate and use technology to better the lives of Washingtonians.&quot; The balance between &quot;innovative&quot; interests and those of consumers is clearly being weighed, and the council will assess &quot;any negative unintended consequences of the pilot program&quot; by next year.<p>Attacking the caps ignores the fact that they are associated primarily with the pilot program and initial regulation.

As for the future here&#x27;s what I would like to see:<p>- Separation of language and libraries. Really the JDK should just ship with just a very small core of classes and everything else should be optional installed via a dependency or package manager. I know jigsaw is going in this direction, but I fear they are going to go the same way as J2ME with profiles. They should also clean up the cruft while they are doing this. This would allow the libraries to evolve separately from the JDK and even allow 3rd party framework to flourish while still keeping things reasonable manageable.<p>- Multiple return types. Scala has hacked around it, Python has them, Go has them. Bite the bullet and implement them so you can do sensible error handling without exceptions or returning `null`. While they are at it they could also fix the type system to finally allow `Integer hello()` and `String hello()` to exist in the same class.<p>- Implement Categories (or mix-ins). Seriously if I have to see another class called StringUtils or IntegerUtils I will gouge my eyes out.<p>- Get rid of the primitives. I read somewhere that this was on the cards for Java 10.<p>- Implement proper Generics.<p>- Implement @property just like Objective-C and .NET so that 80% of class files aren&#x27;t getters and setters. I&#x27;m really surprised they never did this when they implemented annotations as this was the first obvious annotation to add. I know you can do it with Aspect J but you shouldn&#x27;t have to.

We will never again see anything like the enormous forward leaps in realtime graphics that happened during the &#x27;90s.<p>I&#x27;m also a bit put off by their comparison showing that PowerVR has better reflections, shadows, and transparency than a raster engine with reflections and some shadows turned off and a very poor choice of glass-transparency filter.<p>On another look, I don&#x27;t even know what they&#x27;re going for with the shadows. The rasterized image has &quot;NO SHADOWS&quot; printed right between the shadows of a building and a telephone wire, and their hybrid render has the light from the diner windows casting shadows across outside pavement in <i>broad daylight</i>.

As someone in his late 40s, the majority of my age and social group who are &quot;single and childless&quot; are poor impulse control horny drunks.  Love every one of them, but it is what it is.  The second most numerous are gay, many of whom are now becoming not-single as laws change.  Most of the remainder are sociopaths. But anecdote != data so feel free to pretend my reality doesn&#x27;t exist.",1395198091

The trick is finding that proper balance where people are entertained long enough for the real game to load, but not so much that they&#x27;ll want to keep playing the loading game afterwards. I, for one, can&#x27;t wait to be waiting for a loading bar for a loading game to play while the main game loads.<p>Or how about this: Game Loading Lobby MMO, where you can hang out and chat with everyone waiting for their real game to load - IN 3D!. Maybe you can break out the character builder and have people do that, then get dumped into the MMO lobby while they wait for game assets to load.<p>Or you can just put a reddit iframe above the loading bar and call it a wrap.",1395198066

7426565,comment,7426327,7426415,4,0,maccard,,,"I played both consoles for about 3-4 hours pre launch (each), knowing that I was going to buy one. I was a 360 owner last gen, and PS2 the previous gen, so I don&#x27;t have any real allegiances. However, I much preferred the PS4, not only for game selection, but the controllers felt better, and Kinect is great at first, but it really is a bit gimmicky after a while. Kinect sports is fun with friends, but not so much on your own. PS4 has exclusives like Infamous, Killzone, Knack(which I thoroughly enjoyed), Resogun, and loads more. Xbox has Ryse(didn&#x27;t like it) dead rising(granted, it&#x27;s fun) Forza(I want this one)and Titanfall(on the fence, probably don&#x27;t care to be honest). The selection of games on PS4 is far superior, coupled with faster installation times, a much smaller box, and better looking games, makes it a no brainer IMHO",1395198044

The question was whether it would preclude you from great work. In this regard, Ancient Greece is an example of work that did survive - and even, for many centuries, served as a model.",1395198013

Oh, but they're providing test data for free!<p>Kraft is actually renting out a ballroom in SF for anyone who wants to improve their cheese recipe. You get 10k if you can make a better mac and cheese than Kraft! You'll get a gold star on your resume while we make an extra 13 cents per packet sold (on a scale of billions a year).<p>It probably cost Coca-Cola 10k to bring the consultant who thought of this idea. If they truly wished to repay people for bringing immense value to their business they would offer them upwards of a $1M USD, not less than your average car.<p>Coke nearly invented the modern day soft drink industry, and milk that cow to the tune of billions a year. Yet apparently if you beat them at their own game you only get 10k. And your IP taken. And probably a gag agreement.<p>Seems a little unfair, doesn't it?",1362603576

On the web both the controller and view are ephemeral -- they last for  just that one request -- but if the controller is running continuously then it needs to reflect changes in the models as they happen.  The model(s) the controller references can change without the view changing its reference to the controller.<p>Without something like this the view would render stale data.

However it started to make a lot of sense in when building an app, since the controllers are there to stay around, and the models are swappable.<p>Having the option to easily swap out a model at the controller level is worth the extra layer abstraction.

To be a 'design troll' all you need is to have drawn something. After that you're 'protected by copyright' and have the right to file a DMCA takedown once you're infringed. Right?<p>But is there infringement? A lot of the support of LV's takedown was more to do with ethics and morals than the law. Unfortunately they're completely different things.<p>People saying that the similar colour palettes justify a DMCA complaint aren't just wrong but they're misleading the group they post in. Colour palettes aren't copyrightable, colours can in some circumstances be trademarked. Tiffany & co did it. So did T-Mobile.<p>If I use Tiffany blue and T-Mobile magenta in my website about silver-cased phones I won't get a DMCA complaint. I'll be notified of a trademark infringement. I'll probably get my ass beaten up in court.<p>Long story short, is it time that someone put together a resource for founders that explains in plain language when they should/shouldn't be putting in complaints or taking legal action? I'm still a law student so I can't until my degree is over so I'm not really able to. Is anyone in HN qualified and interested?<p>The potential for trolling here is enormous.

There's been some beer keg development using elastic bags and paper cartons to create throaway kegs which eliminate the overhead of sending the kegs back for refilling. Esentially the liquid isn't squirted forth using a pump, but the elasticity of the container. This could be useful because it would get rid of that pesky pump. It'd also save space. When it comes to cooling the beverage, I'd go with either thermoelectric elements (convert electrical potention into thermal potential - Peltier element), or Thermoacoustic elements, which use precisely generated sonic waves to cool liquids. (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermoacoustic_heat_engine"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermoacoustic_heat_engine</a>) Plus? You'll get the cool where you want the cool, and you'll save the whole compressor, evaporator, pump system that regular fridges are. Another thing that's cool, but entirely off topic is acoustic levitation, but it'd neither add to smallness nor convenience of the tap. 
You have a 3d printer at the hackerspace, so use it, but remember that if coca cola uses the design, they'll want to injection mold it. If a part can't be injection molded or stamped from sheet metal, think of some other way to do it. After all, consider that one of the engineers judging it might as well be the engineer who has to make it mass producable. 
You might also, before the competition, go to a local fast food joint and snoop around their machine, ask what problems crop up most with it, etc. The machines coke will provide you will most likely be factory condition, and you won't be able to tell where there's wear, where liquid dries and where dust settles. 
Right now I'm imagining a unibody, 25x15x20 quader which takes collapsible pouches of drink concentrate along with CO pressure cartridges and a water line/water tank (could you use the CO pressure to further compress the water whilst simultaneously cooling it using a thermoacoustic element, thus leading to carbonation? I'm thinking of a CO jet compressor kind of setup) that is easy to fill, easy to clean and hard to break.

Second, the Newton featured a nice application development environment which sat on top of a dynamically-bound programming language running on a portable virtual machine (NewtonScript), which was pretty much a first for devices of this kind.  NewtonScript had a major influence on the development of Java, while Naughton and Gosling were mulling over Oak.

I find those kinds of interviews frustrating since the interviewer is putting no thought into it.<p>A good interviewer is someone who asks questions, then connects them with previously learned information in order to ask a better, more insightful question that they otherwise wouldn't have been able to ask had they not just learned the info. It's clear that this interviewer isn't just going down a list of things to ask. A really good interview is one where the interviewee walks away having learned something, even though they've only answered questions posed to them.<p>Asking questions is a lot like this. If you're more like the first interviewer going through a list of disjoint questions (or questions which only probe for further detail) then it's not surprising to me if people get annoyed. If you're like the second interviewer asking insightful, deeper questions where you're connecting the dots in such a way that you're asking questions that matter and they still get annoyed then perhaps it's just them. Of course, if it's totally new territory for you then you may need to go through seemingly disjoint questions in order to establish a baseline of knowledge to be able to ask more intelligent, interesting questions. You may lose people in your attempt to bootstrap your knowledge to that level.<p>It's also entirely possible that they hate their job but through cognitive dissonance they've learned to cope with it.

Even when the social awkwardness is slightly masked by doing it through hands-free/headphone-mic/phone-to-head, I still often don't want to broadcast to everyone around me what I want to text to a friend.<p>In terms of technology, what's not ready yet on voice control is a way to magically read into the user's gait. That is, I often find myself pausing to think when I type, but when I do that as I'm speaking a sentence, it's often interpreted as me being done with the voice input. Similarly, if I'm speaking out a chain of directions ""text Ronald McDonald that I'll be at McDonald's in 10 minutes"" there's often confusion between which portion of the voice input belongs to which command. This only gets worse as the commands get more complicated.<p>Bottom line: I don't necessarily agree with the author that voice input ""really sucks"" due to input accuracy, but I do think that any experience that relies solely on voice input for interactions (especially when it's designed to be used primarily in public spaces) will really suck.",1362602054

5333657,comment,5328324,5329935,2,0,javert,,,"So, the original question was ""Why is society and culture in the shitter,"" and my answer was ""Kant and his philosophical henchmen."" I think the Enlightenment was going in the right direction, but there was a lot of not-so-great stuff there, too. So the Enlightenment is kind of secondary to the point I'm trying to make.<p>Basically, there were two high points in Western society: ancient Greece, and the Renaissance/Enlightenment* era. Right now, we're not on a high point, and the slope is negative. That's because of the philosophers like Kant that came towards the end of the Renaissance/Enlightenment era.<p>You are actually focusing on the politics of the Enlightenment, but I'm more concerned with how Kant eventually underminded culture by corrupting things on more fundamental levels. Specifically, the metaphysical level (especially the metaphysics of man) and the epistemological level (especially the functioning of man's mind).<p>I'm an Objectivist (i.e., I agree with Ayn Rand's philosophy). I know this isn't a popular stance, but extremely few people who criticize it (or even who profess it in the popular media) actually know what it entails, and world-changing ideas are usually universally ridiculed at first, so I hope you'll take me seriously, despite the unpopularity of the ideas I agree with.<p>So the elevator version is: Ayn Rand is a direct and complete rebuttal to Kant (though not written directly in that manner). You'll have to read her extensively to get the actual rebuttal. As far as supporting the claim that Kant ended the best period in Western history, Rand states this kind of thing, but doesn't try to prove it. Later people (specifically, Leonard Peikoff) have taken up that challenge.<p>Among other things, Rand holds that man can perceive reality and (ultimately) gain knowledge about it, starting via sense perception. Kant held that sense perception itself acts as a filter that makes true knowledge of reality entirely impossible, basically rendering man's mind impotent.<p>Rand also has a unique theory of concept-formation, which is critical to establishing a solid epistemology.<p>Finally, Rand's ethical theory is based on the idea that the is-ought gap can actually be bridged; what is good is what is good for a man. This eventually leads to an actual justification for needing to impose individual rights (in the classic, Founding Fathers sense).<p>Kant was completely against all the above, and actually made the rise of Nazism, Marxism, postmodernism, and modern egalitarianism possible. In fact, I just though of this, but it's probably right to say that modern ""humanistic"" political thought is basically a reaction to fascism, but (unfortunately) still within the underlying paradigm Kant made possible.<p>For example, you need to believe that man has no access to true reality, to believe in dialectical materialism. Same thing to believe in the kind of Nazi racism and nationalism that was rooted in the ideas of the ""German subconsciousness"".<p>To elaborate on that: For Kant, the ""reality"" we experience was created by people's minds. So the German reality (or even the ""proletarian"" reality) is fundamentally different and incompatible with other ""realities,"" and the only ""proof"" you need to assert that it is superior is bald assertion that it is so. I do think I'm essentializing a bit here; for example, other people after Kant took his more fundamental ideas to their logical conclusions in ways that may actually contradict other things Kant wrote, and other philosophers helped pave the way for Kant himself.<p>Anyway, this is just my best (condensed) understanding. I hope to whet your appetite, but don't take me as a representative of other people's ideas.<p>* And the high point of that era was the founding of the United States, which was the first country to be founded on the idea of the individual as sovereign.",1362601868

One of the big drawbacks of the 454 technology that doesn't get talked about a lot is that the immulsion PCR/microbeads require a lot of preparation before the actual sequencing run. On the 454, I believe the sequencing time was ~8hrs, but the preparation time (at least at the facility where I was involved) typically took more than 8 hrs. In terms of actual sequencing time, it's the best system.

I'll add more to that below.<p>> What does Glass add that currently isn't possible WRT gathering data?<p>Since we don't know the hardware specs in very much detail, the only functionality that we know for sure that will be helpful is the camera. The key difference between this camera and a phone camera is that this one is on the user's head. Asking users to take sky photos is likely much less intrusive through Glass than through a phone. But asking them to do this isn't really our style:<p>The original Glass demo video showed the wearer just looking at the sky in order to have weather information delivered [1]. I was imagining something like this for pressureNET. If I could hook into that same operation, I'd be able to automatically take a photo of the sky whenever the user intentionally looks up.<p>Imagine millions of people every day looking at the sky. So. Much. Data.<p>And of course, this is only using the camera that we know is there.

You can't ignore that there are differences between the performance and fit of different employees. So hire and fire the best you can.<p>The key is what happens after that. You'll still have a rough bell curve of how people perform. You can keep chopping off the bottom of that bell curve, but the problem is that that practice is in itself demotivational. It's bad for culture, it's bad for your company. Basically it's negative reinforcement for <i>all</i> your employees, and the response to negative reinforcement isto put it lightlynot optimal.<p>Your bell curve will be sucked backward by the firing black hole and people will start acting out of fear and individual motivations, which include: 1) not being fired, 2) keeping their job at all costs, and 3) looking better than everyone else. Rarely does the fear response motivate people to actually work harder. Instead it leads to a culture of in-fighting, blame, and ladder-climbing games. And in no part of this story are the overall goals of your company recognized, let alone respected or achieved.<p>This is why you don't concern yourself with the slackers. If they really are slacking and not getting anything done, you may fire themno one is stopping you. But this is not your focus. Your focus should be on moving the entire bell curve up by 20%, motivating people to perform beyond their basic abilities, and empowering them to work. These are fluffy phrases, but they are also true. You start from the top down, make sure everyone understands the overall goals of the company, make sure they are well educated about the means and purpose of their work, and that they are enabled to work as well as they can. This is the essence of W. Edwards Deming's philosophy, and yes, it does work this way.<p>Because, more often than not, your ""slacker"" is not simply a bad person who can't work. Very few of those exist in reality. He is probably a person who has not learned the right things, encountered the right motivations, or understood the true purpose of his work, or he has confounding factors preventing him from reaching his true abilities (see Maslow's basic needs theory). Most people want their work to be meaningful, because people fundamentally want their lives to be meaningful.<p>This is what I'm saying: it's far more effective to improve the system surrounding your employees than to simply treat your employees as unaffected robots whose performance is static. Again, I'm not saying you can't fire people when they don't work: I'm just saying that it would be dumb to only focus on that strategy as though there were no other variables, and in fact, the system variables are the important ones when you actually look at it.<p>Best business advice of the last few hundred years:<p>""If you want to build a ship, don't drum up people together to collect wood and don't assign them tasks and work, but rather teach them to long for the endless immensity of the sea.""<p>-- Antoine de Saint-Exupery",1362601476

        def __init__(self, queue):
            self.queue = queue
        def add_job(self, task, params, priority=1):

            })
            self.queue.add(m, priority)
            return m.getID()
</code></pre>
It's pretty clear that the queue service needs to be mocked out, as you don't want to be talking to a real queue for a unit test (you'll probably want some sort of acceptance/integration test to cover this somewhere).<p>However, I have in the past been tempted to make the JSONMessage class injectable, and then inject a mock with a stubbed implementation of getID - I've often seen other people do this as well. The code required to set-up such a fake would be fairly verbose and add little in the way of extra clarity to the test. Since the class is fast and simple (in this scenario it's just a container) then I'd just leave the concrete class in use.",1362600345

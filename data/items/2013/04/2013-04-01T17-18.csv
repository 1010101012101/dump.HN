The app was developed with constant feedback from a few people in that category, so it definitely has more of a 'power user' slant. That said, I do think it could be fun for casual fans to play with too--I'm just not sure if I can find as much of a market by targeting them.",1364839187

The confusion I suspect is from the ""parchment"" often being used as a convenient argument - many in this country take for granted uniform agreement that the document does in fact bind the government; ergo to them the argument is trivially won by quoting it.<p>They do not always realize that those they argue against view the constitution as a ""living"" document subject to interpretation, and may summarily discard arguments that appeal to it's guarantees.

5474645,comment,5473006,5473898,10,0,tomku,,,"Many of us are hesitant to join in discussions like this, because the narrative is dominated by people who have clearly either never used Win8 or had decided that they would hate it based on ideological grounds (ZOMG MS TURNING MAH PC INTO A TABLET) before they ever tried it.  On other forums, even suggesting that you like Win8 is a sure-fire way to get accused of being an ""M$ shill"".<p>Anyways, I like it, so I'll try to explain why.  First off, most of my interaction with it is identical to Windows 7.  I live in my desktop, just like always.  All of my most frequently-used apps are pinned to my taskbar, just like always.  The window borders and decorations look a bit different, but the reaction to them is so completely over-the-top that it's hard to believe.  The rumors that it's a little snappier than Win7 seem to be true, at least on my machines.<p>Yes, all the built-in apps have ribbon toolbars.  No, this really isn't some kind of existential threat to your ability to use your computer.  I hated the shit out of ribbons when they were introduced in Office.  They work really well in Explorer, though.  I'm not really sure how to describe it, but they manage to keep common actions more accessible than the old menu/toolbar combination did.  There are also some small things that I really appreciate, like having a toggle for hidden items on the View ribbon and having both Command Prompt Here and Powershell Here accessible easily via menu and shortcut.<p>Next, the dreaded Start screen, target of much derision and hatred.  My experience with Start menus over the years was that they turned into garbage dumps.  Multiple columns of crap in a hierarchical menu where most of the entries were completely useless.  MS introduced pinning in XP, and ""type to search"" in Vista (I think?) to solve that.  If you use those, Win8's Start screen is a huge upgrade.  If you prefer to hunt through your menus to find apps, you'll be disappointed.  I personally don't miss the start menu at all - I have programs pinned on the start screen, sorted left to right by how often I think I'll need them.  I can run anything else by typing a few letters of its name, and I honestly don't end up doing that very often.<p>Metro apps are a mixed bag in terms of usefulness.  Part of that is that I have a tablet for the kinds of things that Metro apps are good at, and part is that they just aren't there yet in terms of polish.  There are several that I really do like, though.  The Netflix app, for some reason, works MUCH better on my laptop than the website.  Games are generally a good experience as well - I've played a shameful amount of Jetpack Joyride.  The stock Calendar app isn't bad, and it syncs with Google Calendar and pops up notifications for that, which is really cool.  I use the stock News, Sports and Weather apps occasionally as well.  Metro as a whole needs some more work, but I think it'll get it over the next few years.<p>Lastly, I'd like to mention that Win8 is probably the most keyboard-friendly OS I've used.  My most frequently-used PC is a laptop, and I've always been a heavy keyboard shortcut user to avoid having to use the touchpad.  There's keyboard shortcuts for almost everything in Win8.  That includes things like managing/resizing Metro apps, moving around the UI on the Start screen, activating buttons on ribbons.  If you press Alt in Explorer, the ribbon lights up with hotkeys.  They've also added the somewhat famous Win-X shortcut, which pops up a menu with direct access to a lot of tweaking/admin tools.  I miss it whenever I'm on an XP/Vista/7 box.<p>In short, the people who say that it's ""unusable"" or ""crippled"" are full of shit.  It's a solid evolutionary step up from Win7, with a bunch of superficial changes that are being blown way out of proportion.",1364838493

5474643,comment,5473128,5473128,6,0,tvladeck,,,"Currencies have existed in a huge variety of forms over time. Basically anything can work as a medium of exchange as long as everyone has a high degree of confidence that if they are paid in the currency, that they too can pay someone else in that currency. But that's not to say all currency regimes are created equally -- we've learned a number of lessons, painfully, about how to manage currencies.<p>For a small-scale, but very instructive example that shows there are cases where simply increasing the money supply can sometimes create more value in the economy (or how deflation can destroy value), see the story of the Capitol Hill Babysitter Co-Op [0].<p>At a more serious scale, many prominent economists believe that an artificial restriction of the monetary supply led to, or exacerbated the Great Depression [1].<p>So, like Krugman [2], I think that BTC proponents really have to explain how the artificial restriction of the size of the BTC money supply is not a serious design flaw in the currency.

(As you will see from this comment, I'm pretty patient with length, but Morozov defeated me.)<p>Here's my review of the first 4500 words:<p>1) There's a lot of really fucking useless ad hominem.  Offensively useless, offensively voluminous.  Do you actually have something substantial to say about the man, or is it just linkbait?  Oh, I see.  Anyway, after the first ten paragraphs, I just assumed that the author couldn't be trusted in his analysis of O'Reilly, the person.<p>Oh, and there's some hilarious ranting in the first paragraph or four about the offensively bland jargon of silicon valley PR machines.  But it has nothing to do with the rest of the article (even less than the ad hominem on O'Reilly).<p>2) Morozov makes a case that O'Reilly is more interested in Randian entrepreneurship than in user freedom.  I'm not clear how fair it is to tar O'Reilly with the Randian brush (obviously many HNers will say ""tar?!?  laud! gild!"", and we can quietly disagree about that), and again, I no longer trust any assertion Morozov makes about O'Reilly.  But certainly some people exist who are pro-open-source but anti-free-software (especially anti-stallmanite), and many of them are laudable and reasonable people.<p>3) Further on free software vs open source, there's a useful discussion about how Stallman is interested in ends, but open source (and perhaps O'Reilly) is about means.  Particularly interesting is how, in an era of desktop software, licenses were an important means to Stallman's ends, not an end in and of themselves.  If you confuse the means for the ends, then in an era of cloud computing, you might say ""oh these licenses no longer matter so the ends are accomplished"", but of course that's emphatically not the Free Software position.  And maybe we should give serious consideration to the free software position.  (I think we should give serious consideration to the free software position!)<p>4) As Morozov points out, ""open"" is a slippery word, and he has some citations of O'Reilly using it in hilariously slippery and demagogical ways.  I think this is a good point, and I hate that kind of slippery reasoning-by-analogy.  Morozov says ""Few words in the English language pack as much ambiguity and sexiness as 'open'"".  Well, that's true, Morozov, but I can think of a word that's slipperier and sexier: ""free"".  (It's still super-slippery and super-sex if you somehow restrict yourself to the ""libre"" sense.)  Free software advocates are forever trying to explain that my freedom to restrict what you do with software I wrote isn't freedom, and while I support that cause overall, I'm not entirely enamoured of the doublespeak inherent in the branding.<p>And at this point, I ran out of patience with TFA.  Maybe I'll come back to it later, read another 3000 words, and add another comment.<p>Avalanche of verbosity notwithstanding, I think there's an important thing here for hackers, buried in 15k words of bad writing.  I think Stallman's movement is important as a matter of ethics.  And I think the ethics-free engineering-and-business-focused open-source movement is important.  And I think that hackers/coders/developers/compscientists who are also <i>citizens</i> should think seriously about both of these movements.<p>And I think anyone who says ""FLOSS"" is either perpetrating doublespeak, or a victim of it, because ""Free/Libre Software"" and ""Open Source Software"" are different things, which only-sometimes have common cause.",1364838454

Most Rails shops eventually outgrow this architecture choice.  (It's cool, I used it for ~4 years, I'm on your side.)<p>After you break the one app barrier, you tend to break it by a lot.  Many of them will not be customer facing.  For example, churn.example.com might be a simple dashboard coded up by an intern which sits behind HTTP Basic auth and just shows a dashboard with customer LTV broken down by plan.  The churn app is really easy to forget: no customer ever sees it, the intern is back in college, and your team might not care about it.  But e.g. the January Rails bugs were <i>Pre-auth</i> so you could give up code execution on churn.example.com with them.  And churn.example.com sits in your datacenter and talks directly to the main database... <i>uh oh</i>.<p>If I ask you how many instances of Rails apps you have running in your company, and you can't immediately get that number from somewhere (say, an up-to-date list on an internal wiki), you should be terrified.",1364838351

The idea of a civilian warship or artillery piece is as ludicrous then as now. It's not like people have this stuff just lying around the farmhouse. France spent billions of livres fighting the British in that period, more than 1 billion directly on the American conflict. It is entirely accurate to describe the Revolutionary War as a proxy war.<p>From the NRA's magazine[0]:
>The New Hampshire shipments equipped much of the Patriot army at Saratoga in October 1777, and, by 1778, the majority of Washingtons regiments had replaced their earlier disparate mix of arms with French ones.<p>There is a staggering amount of historical revisionism to minimize the role of France in this war, and to omit any context or ulterior motive for them doing so. France was the world's major military power, as well as the largest and most populous country in Europe, and had been for centuries. War between England and France was more often than not the case for nearly 500 years between 1337 and 1815. The American war was by no means the largest or most important of these conflicts.<p>There's a reason that the treaty ending the war was signed in Paris, and it's not because of their fabulous wine and cheese spread.

The reason it's bad is that deflation makes it <i>more profitable</i> to do nothing than to invest. When this happens, people react by not spending money. The market dies. While inflation can be bad, it's at least manageable. In fact, some inflation is actually heathly as it encourages investing.<p>If that doesn't make sense, think of it like this. Inflation is similar to nuclear fusion and deflation is like nuclear fission. When the former goes critical, you can just shut off the spigots and things more or less fix themselves(albeit with some collateral damage) without the whole system crashing. However, with the latter, there may be no fixing without dismantling everything and starting over.",1364837450

Last night, I took some AdvilPM (instead of my usual 3mg melatonin) at 10:30p, was in bed by 11p, and woke up this morning around 8a.<p>This might be because the sleep aid actually pushes me into waking up at the end of a REM cycle; I can't ascertain that.

I've been taking them for about a month now and it's sort of amazing how much better I feel.<p>(Also, as an aside, the first sleep aid I tried a year ago, a tablet of Unisom, did absolutely nothing for me.

I'm the ""No alarm clock"" type of guy, and when I'm very tired from a long week of short sleeps and exhaustive work, I sleep a lot more the first night of the Weekend, and the day after compensate and sleep less, with no planning whatsoever of my sleeping time. 
So I usually sleep 8 hours before waking up, and I feel great, I don't know why. 
What I do know, is that if I set up an alarm to wake me up before that time, say 90 minutes earlier, I would feel bad for a good part of the morning.
I'm quite sure a lot of people (the average people) are experiencing the same natural time span of sleep. Hence the ""myth"" that 8 hours are good for you.
On a side note, my father sleeps a lot less than I do, and most people do, and I can honestly say that he's more tired than the average person in his surroundings. Now that might be linked to stress, but I'm quite convinced that a lack of sleep induces stress, so...",1364837285

The rational thing to do is look at the economic properties of various kinds of things, and grant property rights based on economic phenomena.<p>Why do we grant patents in land? We do so to order economic activity--allow people to develop land without others free-riding on their efforts. We create incentives for people to say clear a plot of land and sell it to a farmer, a market transaction which is not possible without a patent on the land.

The two books are very different and are the product of different authors; Schneier wrote _Applied_ but co-authored _Practical_.<p>_Applied_ is a broad survey of cryptographic techniques that was good for its time but has aged terribly and probably done more harm than good for the industry.<p>_Practical_ is an engineering book; unlike _Applied_, which is a sightseeing tour of the field, _Practical_ is a book about actually building system with cryptography. Also unlike _Applied_, _Practical_ is diligent about recognizing the limitations of mass-market technical books; it explains things just as often to convince you <i>not</i> to implement things as it does to motivate you to implement them. _Practical_ does not have a lot of ""rah-rah"" in it. It's not an evangelistic book. The tone of its prose, a mix of casual, clear, and precise, is all Schneier, but the content is wildly different from _Applied_. It's a narrower book, not a ""bigger"" one.<p>You might be right about the progression of Schneier's other books. I'm not sold on the idea of a career in information security as a springboard to public policy research on security. Real-world security is not very much like information security at all.<p>On the specific issue of the book he's promoting right now, I think it's worth pointing out that Schneier has been wrong as often as he's been right about macro- Internet security. Example: Schneier was an early opponent of vulnerability research, for instance; he used his Crypto-Gram newsletter to single out eEye for irresponsibly disclosing Windows vulnerabilities. eEye was a pioneer of what we'd now call ""Responsible Disclosure"" (an Orwellian term whose basic function is to marginalize Metasploit) and employed people Riley Hassell, Derek Soeder, and Barnaby Jack, all of whom are now vulnerability research authorities.<p> <i>(though you can't necessarily say that for the field of cryptography, which he did more to popularize than anyone; perhaps there are lot of great postdoc crypto people today who got into the field because of _Applied_)</i>",1364836042

Aren't languages stuck on syntax because syntax is what's standard?

Also the risk was not specified, like if they deny and bill you will collections go after you or ""merely"" toss out your app for non-payment or ...

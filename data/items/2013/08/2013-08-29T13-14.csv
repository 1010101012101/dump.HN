And it&#x27;s really hard to upfront design for fun.<p>Without side effects most of the time programming in this way is spent maintaining long arguments lists and passing them around to be able to add even very small features.<p>You want to play sound when player leveled up? Pass soundManager through this 7-functions-long callstack. Now you also want to shoot stars around the player on the occassion? Pass this ParticleEffect handle too. Oh, but the effects should vary depending on the region the player is in? Pass that information to that function too. And time of the day, while you&#x27;re at it, so stars can be blue at night and yellow at day.<p>In the end you give up and pass WorldState variable to every function. I don&#x27;t think pure functional programming is good for prototyping games.<p>I thought about this problem a little, and I think this could be solved by structuring the WorldState variable into a tree, and writing a script that you run after the game is done, that looks inside functions for which parts of the WorldState they really need, and changing them accordingly, so the code is easy to read and functional after the experiments are done.",1377784704

This is not an attempt to curb crime, but instead to curb a popular & harmless hobby enjoyed by people who are card-carrying good guys who have subjected themselves to intense background checks.<p>Little different from banning re-importation of US cars sold overseas on the grounds that a vanishingly small number <i>might</i> be used as getaway cars in crimes.<p><i>The Obama administration is also proposing a federal rule to stop those who would be ineligible to pass a background check from skirting the law by registering a gun to a corporation or trust. The new rule would require people associated with those entities, like beneficiaries and trustees, to undergo the same type of fingerprint-based background checks as individuals if they want to register guns.</i><p>There is a category of <i>extremely</i> tightly controlled weapons known as &quot;NFA&quot; or &quot;Class III&quot;, which includes &quot;sawed-off shotguns&quot;, &quot;silencers&quot;, &quot;disguised guns&quot;, and the very few remaining legal machineguns. To get one of these, one must pay a $200 tax, pass an intensive criminal background check, and have a local Chief Law Enforcement Officer (CLEO) sign the paperwork. This last point is often problematic: despite full legality of the registered purchase, and unquestionable confirmation the buyer is not a criminal and has no criminal intent, many CLEOs nonetheless refuse to sign the paperwork and have no legal obligation to do so. To get around this refusal (amounting to anti-gun bigotry), buyers may (and this has been firmly established by government gun registration department BATFE) create a corporation or trust which legally buys and owns the weapon, available to officers thereof. Shutting down this imputed &quot;loophole&quot; serves absolutely no purpose but to crush the very small category of upstanding citizens who cannot get reasonable cooperation from local officials, citizens who purchase these arms for upstanding hobby or business purposes.<p>In doing so, the Obama is unilaterally moving to destroy a Constitutionally protected activity which is long allowed & regulated by legislation, activity which has no connection to crime.",1377784062

E.g. in my country, the relevant Act begins with &quot;Copyright is a property right&quot; - that isn&#x27;t trying push a point of view, it&#x27;s <i>defining</i> it as a property right. To use a programming analogy, it&#x27;s telling you that Copyright inherits from the class IntangibleProperty (which itself inherits from Property), which gives it a bunch of preexisting attributes and methods.<p>[1] Which isn&#x27;t to say that copyright etc. was a property right back in 17whatever - especially as, back then, choses in action were generally untransferable - only that &quot;property right&quot; was defined back then.<p>[2] Well, mostly: in some countries (IIRC not the US), writing a work that qualifies for copyright also gives you a few  <i>non</i>-proprietary rights, called &#x27;moral rights&#x27;. If you&#x27;re being picky you could argue these aren&#x27;t technically &quot;IP&quot; rights, but they&#x27;re usually included under the IP banner for convenience.<p>(IANAL)",1377783752

In Europe it is pretty easy to drive a car in any country and be able to do it correctly, IF you are used to European road signage. Driving a car in USA when used to European signage is difficult. The signs in USA more often have text, but it is not always more understandable than an icon. What does &quot;PED XING&quot; mean, and how much time and energy do you have to dechiffer it while driving?

When the text is not immediately understandable, you have to recognize it from earlier.

Other OEMs, including Samsung and LG launch products with alternative OSs because they don&#x27;t want to be caught out if OS preferences change. Several OEMs tried Windows Phone and/or Windows RT. Those products failed to gain traction and were abandoned. These OEMs and others will launch Tizen, Firefox OS, and Ubuntu products for the same reasons.<p>Sticking with Windows Phone exclusively in light of its failure at other OEMs looks more like career management than strategy. Launching a Windows RT product, as Nokia is rumored to be doing, is recklessness bordering on insanity.<p>As for Microsoft disappearing from mobile, it looks to me that Ballmer&#x27;s departure anticipates that happening.

Some of them accrue to customers in the form of lower prices, but largely they accrue to management and shareholders in the form of increased profits.  Costco appears to be the exception that proves the rule, here.<p>In theory, efficiency and automation should be a net benefit to society, as we can then enjoy the same level of goods produced with less labor involved, but the uneven distribution of benefits causes lots of avoidable suffering on the part of laid-off workers.<p>A guaranteed basic income for all (as opposed to means-tested benefits like welfare and the EITC) would fix a lot of that.  It would remove the suffering from losing your job, and give investors an incentive to automate even more, as now you would have to pay people quite a bit to motivate them to accept low-skill menial jobs.<p>We can fund such a basic income in part by dismantling the welfare state bureaucracy.

The background explanation (which the author of this post seems to have skipped, for some reason): if you search &quot;Jew&quot; on Google, there&#x27;s a small box (in one of the Ad-Word boxes) that contains a link to this page. The text underneath it is: &quot;We&#x27;re disturbed about these results as well. Please read our note here.&quot;<p>Frankly, I think Google is the victim here. It looks a lot like what a large company has to do each time a bunch of crackpots take it upon themselves to represent the Hurt Feelings of Every Member of [their minority].<p>This is the sort of political correctness that makes me want to puke. This has to be the gem:<p>> So why is a search for Jew different? One reason is that the word Jew is often used in an anti-Semitic context.<p>You mean to tell me that people who hate people of Israeli ethnicity would actually use the word by which that ethnicity is named? I thought they just called them those-who-shall-not-be-named or something.<p><i>Of course</i> some of the results of a search for &quot;jew&quot; will be anti-semitic, or will look anti-semitic <i>at least</i> for someone. Some people aren&#x27;t smart enough, or interested enough, to understand that it&#x27;s not Google&#x27;s fault that some people don&#x27;t like people of Jewish descent and choose to make their opinion public.<p>tl ; dr: Google doesn&#x27;t seem to consider the word &quot;Jew&quot; to be offensive; Google looks like it tries to explain not-so-computer-literate users that the pages it indexes have nothing to do with their own opinions and options, just like it indexes both the pages that explain when abortion should be an option and the ABORTION IS CRIME crackpottery.<p>Unfortunately, it looks like the superficial and easily-inflamed are collateral damage here :-).",1377781513

6295540,comment,6288763,6292490,1,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"I think maybe I did a poor job of explaining myself.<p>Yes, I understand the things the tests provide. These kinds of tests have been around forever. Personally I don&#x27;t like them, most engineers don&#x27;t, but that&#x27;s not going to make them go away.<p>My question was about the organization itself. Why measure something if you&#x27;re not going to do anything with it? So in your example, where you&#x27;re not motivated by money, but its a job that pays well and is boring, why find that out if you&#x27;re not going to use it to disqualify someone?<p>The question in general is this: why measure something if there are no consequences to what you measure? I wasn&#x27;t trying to say the test was great, I was asking the reason the test was given in the first place. The way I see it, it would have to be disqualifying in some cases. Otherwise, there&#x27;s no reason for the measurement. Unless the goal is just to create a lot of arguing, which it seems to have done very well!<p>I think the problem is we like to wave our hands around and say &quot;well, the test <i>informs</i> the decision, but is not definitive&quot;. This is just another way of saying that we don&#x27;t know what we are doing -- there is no plan.<p>This is probably the root of the author&#x27;s discomfort. Either he doesn&#x27;t understand what&#x27;s going on as far as the evaluation, or there&#x27;s no reason for it, or both. Don&#x27;t know. All I know is the guy was smart.

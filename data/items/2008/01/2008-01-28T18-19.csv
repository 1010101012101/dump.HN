And specifically, I was responding to the comment ""studios moving away from C/C++"".  Which, of itself, has nothing to do with Lisp.<p>Regardless, I'll take that as a ""no"".",1201546632
105700,comment,105435,105659,0,0,randallsquared,,,"> I strongly believe that client side state is the _only_ worthwhile solution; We need to accept that fact and get rid of continuations.<p>It's not clear to me if you're joking, but in case you're not: there are some situations, especially in closed-system webapps, where it's useful to use a non-transparent scheme for resources.  You don't want people to jump into a middle page of a survey or other workflow, and going out of your way to have the middle pages accessible via a RESTful scheme seems pointless and potentially misleading.  Continuations or similar methods for papering over the ""page"" abstraction can be helpful, here.  Even if you don't use something like that, you'll end up doing the same thing manually.<p>I agree, though, that those who use this style typically overuse it and apply it to situations (like, er, discussion forums... ;) where it isn't really appropriate.",1201546571

I don't agree with everything the author says and wasn't trying to be a troll.<p>This brings up an interesting question.  I assume most people post things they find interesting even if they do not agree with the content, no?  Does anyone think that every story someone posts reflects that individual's beliefs?",1201546132

After 2 weeks in Colemak, I'm at 40 WPM and growing.<p>If ""learning curve"" is stopping you from switching keyboard layouts (as it was me), don't let it: Colemak decreases that transition time to bearable levels.",1201545890

Public shareholders in general want the stock to rise. Not in a year, not in six months, but now. This means shortsighted decisions, that can hurt their image. But you don't see this on the quarterly report, since longterm benefits in form of image get sacrificed for short term benefits.<p>Also like any other growing tech company, the suits come in and take control. And all they care about is quarterly earnings and bonuses.",1201545018

Like you say, it focuses you on what the core value of your application is without being distracted by the social networking fluff around the outside.<p>If what you create proves to be really compelling, you should be able to convert a good portion of your Facebook users over to a stand alone version of your app at a later date.<p>Obviously this only really works if enough people in your target market fit into the typical Facebook demographic.",1201543778

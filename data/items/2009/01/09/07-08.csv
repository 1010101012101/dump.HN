I just assumed that the author was proud of himself for discovering element.scrollTo().<p>As noted above, it's not a good UI, nor is it revolutionary or even new.  So I guess I have to argue that it is not, in fact, progress.",1231487515

Maybe even offer a prepay option so you can pay with your paypal account and just read off a confirmation number to the cab driver or something at the end of the trip for them to bill you with. Maybe in order to prevent confusion over more than one cab being called from the same location the app can light your phone screen up in a unique color for you to call the cab with as it approaches.<p>This wouldn't really be necessary in NYC where cabs are ubiquitous but in DC it would be useful.<p>EDIT: Crud, already sorta exists: <a href=""http://taximagic.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://taximagic.com/</a>",1231485926

That would still be an improvement in my opinion.<p>Fortunately, the internet has an existing idiom for ""simplify and shorten your message"", which is of course: ""tl;dr"".<p>Franklin's prose could get very convoluted! I don't know whether he was showing off, or whether it was just the style of the time that he didn't think to change. He was fond of listing things in dense paragraphs so it's unfortunate that bulletpoints weren't invented until 1958 (seriously). Modern pundits are aware that simplicity can lead to more effective messages; we have widely-publicized advice like ""Keep It Simple, Stupid"". Maybe that's a modern insight or fashion.",1231485506

426341,comment,424043,424495,0,0,nostrademons,,,"> For the people in the middle group, I think the big danger is not knowing what to do next.<p>That was the big reason for me.  There were a bunch of contributing factors - rejected by YC 3 times, no luck with other outside investors, better opportunity came up, all other founders quit, scope of the project was much bigger than we envisioned, continuous problems simplifying the UI enough that I'd want to use it myself, and some doubt about whether current browser performance is even good enough to run the product - but I kept going through all of them until I really had no idea what to do next.<p>Joel's comment about it taking a long time before you can even know what knobs to tweak is right on.  Early-stage products are almost completely <i>wrong</i>, and oftentimes they're so fractally wrong that nobody will bother telling you how to make them right.  Launching helps, <i>if</i> you can get users.  But many startups fail to get even one loyal user.",1231485348

I remember all that, before bittorrent was even a dream, when you'd have a bunch of fserves instituting their own caps and queues and stuff on dozens of different mostly-content-specific servers.

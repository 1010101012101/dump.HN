Arts ""teaches you to think"" in ways that CS/Engineering students are never even exposed to (except for by some token arts requirements) - it teaches you have to think about <i>people</i> and the human condition. I would much rather have a CS grad help me start a company, but equally rather have an Arts grad <i>run</i> it (See Warren Bennis' <i>On becoming a leader</i> for a much better investigation into why Arts students make the best leaders [of human beings]).<p>I'm not saying that Arts is <i>better</i> in any way - I'm just asking for mutual respect. No poli sci student is going around saying they can prove the amortized runtime of a skip list - if you're in CS please don't pretend you've had their education either. Your education also isn't any ""harder"" in any objective way - ODEs or building an OS in C is not any more difficult than wrapping your head around Aristotle or existentialist phenomenology, it really isn't. It's actually much easier to get an A in CS than Arts, but that's a bit of an aside.<p>I realize that this was an article not a comment, and I don't intend to start a debate. I just think we need some mutual respect between the disciplines and there seems to be a latent ""bash artsies"" in some tech writing that really needs to be squashed - it's not helping anyone.<p>[more to the point of the article: My subjective anecdotal evidence is that arts grads have a MUCH harder time getting hired post-grad (which makes sense considering they chose to learn fundamentals not practical skills) so they go either a) travelling b) to grad school c) to law school. This is a major skew, none of these people should be consider employed, but they don't contribute to the arts grads unemployment rate either]",1288630667

There has been a lot of math and pseudo code, and logic. Programming rarely comes into it, and when it does, it is (generally) trivial (and it is OK if you get it partially wrong).<p>Compare this to my undergraduate in philosophy, where I was generally writing at minimum 30 pages per class per semester in term papers, regular writing assignments, and thousands of pages of reading.<p>There is no question to me that the undergraduate philosophy degree was more challenging.\n(this is solely based on my experience, I do not mean to indicate it reflects all experiences with all MS CS/ BA PHIL experiences.)<p>In the philosophy degree, I learned theory and wrote (and I wrote a lot). \nAnd sometimes my papers came back with lots of red ink. \nI took my lumps and rewrote them.<p>In the CS degree I regurgitate facts, and write the occasional Java program. (Normally from a 'starter' program).<p>There is no question to me that an ideal CS degree would be as programming intensive as an arts degree is writing intensive.

They don't ever understand what's going on with the pointers and are often content to just keep trying combinations of the syntax until the appropriate result comes out and the compiler stops yelling at them.<p>Maybe the point is that if you don't require C++, students will (obviously) often pick the language what provides the easiest way to complete their lab in a timely fashion so they have social time or time to work on other classes. Even those who DO care and would absorb the low level knowledge provided won't take that ""risk"" by doing their labs in C++ since early on it just means their work will take longer to complete than classmates.<p>Note: As I said my school always allowed the usage of C++, usually allowed Java as well.

Either way, one of the big problems is that the heuristics for a heuristic algorithm must be designed by with human insights.  In this case, and in many other cases where GA's have been applied successfully, a fundamental new insight is discovered by the algorithm.<p>I do play some SC2.  There are a bunch of built-in AIs that use heuristic algorithms, yet they are all easily defeated.  The GA in this case is really about searching through an immense space to find good candidates.<p>To give you a feel for the complexity of the building problem, consider this.  There are custom maps where are all you do is practice your initial build order, with absolutely no opponent.  It is pretty well accepted within the SC2 community that you should use these practice maps in order to get better.  Another way to think about it is that this build order will probably cause Blizzard to tweak the game due to how fast the roaches come out.  This game has been in development for 10 years, yet there are interactions of the building process that are not understood by the developers themselves.",1288630441

The barrier to communication is higher; there is more inertia to overcome.  When collocated, you can just shout out to the room, ""Hey, does someone know about X?"".  When remote, it's often a chat room of some form instead.  There's a little more effort required.<p>In my book, one requirement of a remote (team) worker is that he be at least a bit extroverted.  My experience has been that less extroverted developers find themselves quickly out of the loop.  I believe this is because they don't seek out interaction with other team members and so fall out of sync with the team.<p>The lack of physical presence can put a strain on relationships.  Sight unseen, it is so easy to project unintended meaning onto the text, or speech of colleagues (granted, we do this in-person as well but to a lesser degree).<p>Body language provides real cues that are missing from remote communication.  I try to resolve this by meeting colleagues/clients early in the process to help build that relationship.<p>When you put the communication part aside, there is the question of motivation.  I've also found that some people, when working remotely, tend to backslide and become less productive.  I believe this to be due to the lack of implicit peer pressure of seeing your colleagues working.  Or, to put it bluntly, a lack of solid work ethic.<p>When remote working, there is less (micro-)management.  No one is looking over your shoulder.  For some people, remote pairing can help here.<p>Ultimately, there is no substitute for a deeply engrained need to ship.  Either you've got it or you don't.  If you don't, you're probably not going to be a good remote worker.",1288628539

Global coverage just isn't that useful to all but a tiny number of users.<p>The obvious customers were seafarers, but they had been using Inmarsat for years. Their network achieved near-global coverage using four geosynchronous satellites. You needed a big antenna and a powerful transmitter, but that was no problem on an ocean-going vessel. The same went for fixed installations in remote areas on land. Inmarsat was at the time a UN-backed nonprofit established to improve safety of life at sea and was under no particular commercial pressures.<p>GSM took off in a huge way in the early nineties, so by the time Iridium launched most of the developed world was blanketed in GSM coverage. Multi-band handsets and roaming agreements meant that most travelling business customers already had a handset that worked just about everywhere at relatively low cost.<p>There was still a gap in the market for portable communications in less developed and more sparsely populated areas, particularly Africa and the Middle East. The later network Thuraya solved that problem cheaply and elegantly by putting a geostationary satellite over Ethiopia and covering most of the market for handheld satellite phones after just one launch. They now cover 70% of the world's land mass with just two satellites and are far more profitable than the revived Iridium.<p>Iridium could have pivoted. They had a lot of sunk R&D costs, but the initial 66 satellites were built and launched in an enormous binge between 1997 and 1998. They had a gap of at least six years between conceiving the idea and building the first piece of hardware. I believe that they failed to do so because they were preoccupied with the idea of providing truly global handheld telephony, rather than the more mundane task of making a product that people want. Iridium brilliantly solved the technical problem of providing telephone coverage to parts of the world with very few people, but failed to realise the basic flaw in that business model.<p>Iridium turned out to be a wonderful gift to humanity, but it was a bloody awful business decision.",1288627962

The premise of the article is that Apple has the power to kill anything they set their mind to. It uses the lazy argument of the slippery slope or thin end of the wedge (""What's next?""). It's simply fearmongering;<p>3. It mistakes cause and effect. A classic example of this was Intel's original Centrino platform, which became the basis of Intel's success (after the Pentium 4 debacle) for years. At the time it launched Intel spent $150m+ on marketing it. Sadly, many observers attributed its success to that marketing campaign when in fact the lesson is:<p><i>Good products sell themselves.</i><p>Centrino succeeded because it was a good product.<p>Flash came about at a time to solve a problem of creating ""rich"" Internet applications (""RIAs"") when it wasn't possible any other way. That's no longer the case with a plethroa of Javascript frameworks and browsers with fast Javascript engines in them.<p>The use case for Flash was going away anyway. Apple just hastened its inevitable demise. They haven't killed it. They just threw some oil on the fire that was already burning down the house.<p>4. Apple is on the outs with a bunch of other companies? Large companies are complex creatures. You will find them competing savagely on one level while cooperating on another.

Google has my multi-year mail history (content plus a pretty big social graph that means far more than a few old school friends), my searches (and therefore interests), what adverts I've clicked on, which pages get the most traffic on my websites. It has documents I've worked on with friends and associates. It has my calendar. I've got a bunch of sites sitting on Google servers. When I use my iPhone, Google provides the maps and knows where I'm going.",1288627731

Suffice it to say that that compares quite favorably to what VAs make.  (You can get them from single digits in low-wage countries to $20 ~ $40 an hour for higher end stateside VAs.)<p>I've had huge, huge successes previously with outsourcing content creation and web design, and now that consulting has given me something of a cushion, I anticipate doing more things where I really add value to the business and less grunt work.

I know that sounds trite but that's not what I mean it to sound like. My point is this: no one knows better than you two what your goals are with the company. You said, ""We're bootstrappers by nature and would rather have our first business be a strong base hit than aim for the fences."" I'll take you at your word that this is true.<p>So the question that you and your co-founder have to answer is whether or not you want your personal finances to be at $25m, $50m or higher in 10 years? If so, it's less likely that this will happen if you bootstrap rather than raise/sell. And there is no right/correct answer - no one can tell you which you should do, only what they might do in your situation or what they think someone like you might do in that same situation.<p>There are other aspects to it as well but the key point is, in 5-10 years from now, what will you want? Do you still want to be running the business or will you want to have hit the ""reset"" button and have moved on to something else? There's no crystal ball so you have to take the risks and rewards all into account.<p>Good luck and congrats on getting to where you are!",1288627566

As a non-tech who is hoping to found soon, I'd appreciate hearing any lessons leaned on this subject - good or ill. Thank you.<p>Lesson 6 by PG ""I forgot to include this in the early versions of the list, because nearly all the founders I know are programmers. This is not a serious problem for them. They might accidentally hire someone bad, but it's not going to kill the company. In a pinch they can do whatever's required themselves.<p>But when I think about what killed most of the startups in the e-commerce business back in the 90s, it was bad programmers. A lot of those companies were started by business guys who thought the way startups worked was that you had some clever idea and then hired programmers to implement it. That's actually much harder than it sounds—almost impossibly hard in fact—because business guys can't tell which are the good programmers. They don't even get a shot at the best ones, because no one really good wants a job implementing the vision of a business guy.<p>In practice what happens is that the business guys choose people they think are good programmers (it says here on his resume that he's a Microsoft Certified Developer) but who aren't. Then they're mystified to find that their startup lumbers along like a World War II bomber while their competitors scream past like jet fighters. This kind of startup is in the same position as a big company, but without the advantages.<p>So how do you pick good programmers if you're not a programmer? I don't think there's an answer. I was about to say you'd have to find a good programmer to help you hire people. But if you can't recognize good programmers, how would you even do that?""(http://paulgraham.com/startupmistakes.html#f10n)",1288627456

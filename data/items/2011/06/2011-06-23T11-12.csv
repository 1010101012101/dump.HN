It's hard to know which variation can be accurately attributed to intra-species variation or sub-species or even separate species.<p>However, what is clear is that there is a great deal of variation in Africa, Asia, and Europe around the time of the ""eretines"". My feeling (back when I was a student) was that the archaeological evidence suggested an ongoing adaptive radiation of sorts, rather than the classic picture of a steady and relatively homoegeneous trajectory towards modern humans. But a lot of new research has been done since then that I'm not up to speed on.<p>Prior to the displacement and extinction of the remaining human forms there was already a reduction in the number and variation of <i>Homo</i> species. Even within our own species, there was much greater variation some 200-150kya.<p>There aren't any easy (accurate) answers to these sorts of questions, which is also why they are such fascinating areas of research. Understanding all the factors and events involved is very difficult with the type of information available.<p>You just have to look at the incredible lack of hominid (great ape) fossils for the last many million years of years to see know how difficult it can be to piece together an evolutionary history of a taxonomic group.",1308829809

2687459,comment,2686580,2687182,62,0,yaakov34,,,"It seems from some of the comments down the thread that the idea of writing over memory in C++ is new to many people. Let me introduce another couple of concepts.<p>You don't have to stop with writing over the variables. You can write over the return address of a function, which is stored on the same stack as the variables. If you write some user-supplied buffer to memory, and you didn't carefully make sure that the memory is allocated for this purpose, the (malicious) user can supply you with data that will set the function's return address to something in his buffer, and the function will go on executing his code. That's called a buffer overflow vulnerability, and it's been well known and exploited for decades; half the patches you see coming down the pipeline used to be for this.<p>Now, there are good ways to protect against buffer overflow vulnerabilities. If you make the stack and data non-executable, and the pages containing code non-modifiable, then seemingly there is no place for the attacker to place his code and get it to run. Modern processors support this in hardware.<p>Except that some people came up with something called return-oriented programming. This works by finding little pieces in your code that do something simple like increment a register or write a byte of data, followed by a ""return"" instruction. These tiny pieces of code are called ""gadgets"". You can usually find enough gadgets to make a Turing-complete language. Then you write a compiler which transforms your code into a stream of calls to the gadgets. Now all you need is one overwrite of the return address on the stack, and you can start playing the application like a piano, without ever executing data or modifying code. There are now tools to automate all this.<p>I don't want to reveal anything about where I work, but we write applications which need to be reliable and secure. We have regular meetings to discuss vulnerabilities and security techniques. At the meeting where we discussed return-oriented programming, when we asked what we could do to protect from it, the consensus answer was ""You can't. Don't make any buffer overruns."" The problem is it's not clear that anyone ever wrote a program free from those.<p>Since hotel analogies seem to be so popular, here you go: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psycho_(film)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psycho_(film)</a>",1308828130

2687451,comment,2686580,2686918,1,0,stoney,,,"Exactly.  I didn't mean to imply that pointers are evil or should be avoided.  That was supposed to be the point of my dynamite analogy, but I guess the comment made elsewhere on this topic about the inadequacies of analogies holds true here.<p>So, for the avoidance of doubt, I believe: pointers are awesome, powerful tools and you can do some great things in C/C++ using them and I sometimes miss them (a little bit) when using other languages.  But you can also do some terrible things with them - and I have done some spectacularly bad things with them in the past.  But that doesn't mean they are bad - it just means that I am reckless.",1308827898

If we're really taking the absolutist stance that nothing that introduces a potential security issue (or the slightest additional radioactivity) is allowed then we might as well abandon all technology and go back to living in caves.<p>At least <i>try</i> to make a case that WebGL, if not strangled at birth, will create a noticeably less safe web than would exist in a world with all the current issues, all the ones associated with Silverlight and Flash using GPUs, and all the new issues from whatever other features are added to browsers, computers or smartphones over the same timeframe.",1308827834

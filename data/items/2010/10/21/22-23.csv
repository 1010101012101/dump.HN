Also, you can't accidentally download a ton of useless Opera toolbars.<p>3. Opera is free, independent, standards-compliant, secure, etc. - a lot of things that we geeks love.<p>4.

1817766,comment,1817417,1817417,0,0,ssp,,,"The tagline from <i>Innovator's Dilemma</i> is that <i>well-managed</i> companies can get into trouble when they are being disrupted. The reason is that it's normally good business to get rid of low-margin products and focus your resources on the ones that make the most money. And then someone takes over the low end and expands into the high end.<p>But Intel is not falling for that one. They have made the Atom, a slow, cheap, low-power chip that competes directly with ARM.  That's likely a wise move, but Intel now has the problem that low-margin chips are still bad business. They have to have their expensive best-in-industry fabs make low-margin Atoms, when they would much, much rather have them make expensive Xeons.<p>At one point they made a deal to have Atoms manufactured at TSMC, which would have helped a lot with this problem, but apparently that deal didn't work out. Even if it <i>had</i> worked out, the Atom would no longer have the process advantage, and then backwards compatibility would be the <i>only</i> advantage for x86. With Windows becoming less and less relevant, that's a big problem, considering the technical advantages ARM has over x86.<p>So fundamentally, Intel has a problem that CPUs are becoming commoditized, which means they will either have to take much lower margins or retreat to the high end. Both scenarios are unpleasant for them.",1287701276

I think so because JavaScript, with its prototype system, dynamic typing and closures, makes various famous language features and their implementations explicit, while other languages may hide their inner workings in the name of simplicity, safety, etc. Thus, by learning JavaScript first, one can bypass the reverence for OOishness espoused by Java or C#, and yet understand them better because ""class"", ""type"", ""object"" in JavaScript understood to be not atomic concepts, but constructable pieces of code. With JavaScript, one starts interacting with inner workings of the language very early in the learning process. Really, in which language one learns about events first? Remember ""onClick""? Sure, interaction starts at level 0, but that's great because already the value of events is understood without writing a single ""public static main voiid"".",1287700068

As a Mac developer if you want to sell software right now, you have to handle <i>everything</i> yourself.<p>A Mac App Store (which is entirely optional to participate in) gives you increased visibility, a massive audience, and takes care of the pesky payment details for you.

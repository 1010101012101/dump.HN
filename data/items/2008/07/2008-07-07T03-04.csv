Leadership is contextual to the purpose of a group. A great soccer player is likely to be a leader on a soccer team, but if she is a bad musician, she won't be a leader in a band, no matter how charismatic or likeable she is.<p>3. Popularity is leadership without authority.<p>4. Lacking an external evaluation function, a group implicitly invents one.<p>This implies that nerds would actually be popular in groups with an evaluation function for smartness.<p>The solution is to create critical masses of people brought together in the context of a need to be smart.",1215402481

I'm a skill and competent programmer but haven't really delved into the realms of server administration beyond a single server.  I'm working a project that requires me to scale an app across multiple servers as traffic increases and want to know some resources for learning the ins and outs.  Books, online resources, etc.  Load balancing, database clustering federating or whatever the terms are, software architecture and how to go about administrating the servers, etc.<p>I want it to be similar in nature to google's app engine in that once the app is built it scales automatically and I don't need to modify the code after the fact as things get bigger.",1215402069

238281,comment,237786,237786,0,0,jrockway,,,"I think this is yet another argument against JavaSchools.  The article mentions roles, which are a very powerful way to compose class fragments into classes; usually much more cleanly and reusably than inheritance.  Unfortunately, Java doesn't have Roles (or Traits; same thing), so you just can't teach it.  Instead, you have to teach hackish workarounds that don't even work.  The choice of ""a real language"" to teach computer science means that you can't actually teach computer science.  Instead you teach Java.<p>It's a shame that students have to begin their programming careers by working around bad tools.<p>Anyway, I think everyone with a degree in computer science should at least be able to write programs in Smalltalk, C, Lisp, and a dynamic language (Perl/Python/Ruby).  Let them learn .NET and Java in trade school.  They are of dubious educational value.",1215401852

Digg made a big design mistake initially in copying Slashdot too literally, and having stories that make the frontpage start at the top and get pushed down.  That causes all sorts of problems.  Having stories bubble up from the bottom is much more robust.  But even if they did that I bet the percentage of frontpage stories from the top 10 users would surprise most people.<p>Edit: Steve Huffman just reported the number for Reddit, and it's a lot lower than Digg's: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=238290"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=238290</a>",1215400692

This is where, in an attempt to combat so-called 'math anxiety' (one of the panoply of diseases which are actually caused by school), math is made to seem 'friendly'. To help your students memorize formulas for the area and circumference of a circle, for example, you might invent this whole story about 'Mr. C', who drives around 'Mrs. A' and tells her how nice his 'two piesare' (C = 2πr) and how her 'pies are square' (A = πr2) or some such nonsense.<p>But what about the real story? The one about mankind’s struggle with the problem of measuring curves; about Eudoxus and Archimedes and the method of exhaustion; about the transcendence of pi?<p>Which is more interesting? measuring the rough dimensions of a circular piece of graph paper, using a formula that someone handed you without explanation (and made you memorize and practice over and over) or hearing the story of one of the most beautiful, fascinating problems, and one ofthe most brilliant and powerful ideas in human history?

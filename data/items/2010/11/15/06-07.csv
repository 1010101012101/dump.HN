1905513,comment,1905004,1905004,0,0,camz,,,"Knowing China intimately and having a family with multiple businesses in the countries has given me an unique understanding of the business world in the country (they own factories in southern china that produce clothing for American companies like armani exchange and RL and are constantly required to deal with the government in regards to labor, customs and etc).<p>The main reason why every American company will fail in China is because of cultural differences.  American companies lack the ability to understand the Chinese mindset and often that leads to misunderstandings that wont be easily forgiven.<p>American companies that truly want to succeed in China need to readjust their business model.  You cant bring an American company to China, you need to invest and develop organically a Chinese company that is substantially owned by an American company so that the citizenry and the state will allow and appreciate its existence.<p>As for competition among the Chinese companies, it is often the case that developing a relationship with the government is vital.  But, developing a relationship or ""guanxi"" is a very different concept in Asian culture compared to American culture.  Giving a ""red envelope"" is considered a necessary sign of respect and acknowledgment of their status, but in the US its a straight out bribe.<p>To curry favor with the people is simple, just give lots and lots of free data, products or whatever the people want. Whether that data is copyrighted, patented or otherwise.  That's how baidu did it, thats how youku did it and thats how the next big thing is going to do it.<p>China's next big wave is going to be to develop its own silicon valley of sorts because its very popular to copy American startups and put an Asian spin on the idea to create a NEW multi-billion dollar company.",1289804372

1905489,comment,1903515,1905320,0,0,camz,,,"Hey ars, well the best way to explain the concept is to think about how you are taxed on dividends.  When you buy stock in Google and receive dividends, you would pay tax on that income on your 1040, but it would not be taxed as a ""self-employment income"" and thus SE Tax is not levied.<p>An S-Corporation is a standard C-Corporation that has elected for special treatment.  Instead of paying double taxation, its income is directly passed-through to the taxpayer.  But, that does not change the character of the income.  The income is still considered a ""corporate distribution"" or a dividend.  Thus, it cannot be cannot be taxed under SE Tax rules because a dividend is not ""self-employed income.""<p>This rule is found at IRC § 1368 (c)(2) :<p>In the case of a distribution described in  subsection (a)  by an S corporation which has accumulated earnings and profits—<p><pre><code>      1368(c)(1) Treatises Accumulated adjustments account.\n      That portion of the distribution which does not exceed the accumulated adjustments account shall be treated in the manner provided by subsection (b) . \n\n      1368(c)(2)Dividend.\n      That portion of the distribution which remains after the application of paragraph (1) shall be treated as a dividend to the extent it does not exceed the accumulated earnings and profits of the S corporation. \n\n      1368(c)(3)Treatment of remainder.\n      Any portion of the distribution remaining after the application of paragraph (2) of this subsection shall be treated in the manner provided by subsection (b) . \n</code></pre>\nBut, note that you must pay a reasonable salary to yourself first to apply this tax strategy or plan.  There are certain pitfalls that you must be aware of as with any tax plan.<p>I hope that this has been helpful! =D",1289803510

(""The bottom line is: If you are finding yourself admire other people and try to copy how they succeed, then you are at a pace that is NOT reasonable for you."")<p>However, the ideas stand:\nTo have a large success, you need to a) be doing something, b) avoid rushing things _too much_ [1], and c) pay attention to how small or insulated your market is.

The optimization of time spent really depends on the situation. For instance, if you're rehashing an old idea and selling based on the UI, it's worth going over with members of your target market before you release, to make sure what they _use_ is easy for them to find. But if your idea is new, you need to release ASAP to get market validation while you can still pivot if you're a bit off the mark.",1289803085

I know Grinnell had something similar.  I have to imagine that other colleges did too.<p>Amherst also had the DailyJolt, a web forum founded around 1999, and that one actually expanded to several other campuses.<p>I suspect that FaceBook became dominant because it had a.) the right features b.) at the right time c.) expanding to the right places d.) in the right order.<p>Sites like Friendster died because they missed critical features, namely the ability to stay up for a reasonable amount of time under load.  Friendster was also good for making friends (or at least recording them), but didn't provide very much for you to do with them.<p>Sites like planWorld - and LiveJournal, for that matter, which was far better and more dominant than FaceBook in 2004 - failed because they were too early.  They couldn't get a critical mass of people to explode in popularity, because social networking was still a niche activity, popular among geeks and nerds but not among the general public.<p>Sites like Campus Network (or planWorld, again) failed because they failed to expand.  As the article says, Campus Network was way more popular among Columbia students, and FaceBook had to struggle to make inroads at Columbia.  And among Amherst students who attended between 1996 and 2005, planWorld still tends to be more popular than FaceBook.<p>Sites like MySpace failed because they tried to expand in the wrong order.  MySpace captured the 20-something music scene, and then the high school market.  But college kids don't do what high school kids are doing, high school kids do what college kids are doing.  And (at least in technology) kids don't do what their parents are doing, parents do what their kids do.  FaceBook had perfect positioning to take over the rest of the market, because high school kids do what college kids do, and college kids eventually graduate and become 20-somethings, and then parents do what their kids are doing.  MySpace had no room to expand once FaceBook captured the college market, because they lost the high schoolers to FaceBook, and then they had no beachhead to grab the parents.<p>It kinda reminds me of what Google told us during orientation: Google succeeded because they had the right idea, at the right time, with the right technology and the right people, in the right place.  And without any of those elements, they would've failed miserably.  I suspect a lot of startups are in the same boat.",1289802759

ZFS detects corruption much more quickly.<p>Second, your traditional raid recovery is to rewriting the entire device to fix a single block. Let&#x27;s say you&#x27;re using RAID5 and you&#x27;re rewriting parity. You get another block error. Oops, now you&#x27;ve lost everything. Since disks have an uncorrectible block error rate of 1 in 10^15 bits, you only need a moderately sized array to almost guarantee data loss. ZFS rewrites corrupt data on the fly.",1409666377

Good retrospectives aren&#x27;t complicated and don&#x27;t take that much time, but they are arguably the most important part of a successful agile team.<p>Most of the best ideas in agile come from lean manufacturing concepts and arguably the most important part of lean manufacturing is continuous improvement. Continuous improvement in software process comes from retrospectives.<p>When teams fail to do retrospectives, they fail to learn from their mistakes and discuss ways to improve. I don&#x27;t care what your process is, if you do retrospectives consistently and commit to take action after each retrospective, you can make any process more awesome.<p>Teams that don&#x27;t improve their process end up with a crappy process that nobody likes.

8257551,comment,8257327,8257327,4,0,mschaef,,,"You need to have a clear understanding of the point of the analysis before you analyze anything. What, specifically, does your team have to produce? How much time and how many people do you have to complete the work? If you&#x27;re the leading edge of an effort to rewrite 100MLoc, my presumption is that your deliverable is mainly a &#x27;gross anatomy&#x27; of the system... a basic description of the major structural components and how they interact with each other. If that&#x27;s the case, I&#x27;d start by looking at the build scripts and the modules they build. Try to make a comprehensive list of major components. You&#x27;ll get it wrong initially, but you&#x27;ll need a starting point.<p>The next thing I&#x27;d do is take the top level list of modules and start assigning it to individual people within the team. Their responsibility is to produce some kind of top level description of how the individual modules work.  A big part of this phase of the effort should be meetings or informal conversations as the per-module analysis progresses. As your team talks among itself, you should be able to find commonality between modules, communication links, etc. The key at this point is to keep it high level, and avoid getting too bogged down in the details. With this much code, there are plenty of details to get bogged down in. As a result, you&#x27;ll probably have some mysteries about how the code actually works beneath various abstraction layers. Make and update a list of these &#x27;mysteries&#x27; and keep it next to your team&#x27;s list of modules. As you work through the list of modules, some of these will solve themselves, and some will be so obviously important that it&#x27;s worth a detailed deep dive to really understand what&#x27;s happening. Either way, there will be times that you have no idea what&#x27;s going on in the codebase and you&#x27;ll just have to trust that you&#x27;ll figure it out later.<p>One final comment I&#x27;d like to make is that, as silly as SLoC is as a measure of the size of a software system, you&#x27;re looking at a large software package. (Bigger than Windows, Facebook, Linux, OSX, etc.) If you take each line of code to have cost $5-10, then the system arguably cost $1B to build in the first place.<p>Because of the size of the system, you shouldn&#x27;t expect your analysis work to be easy, fast, or cheap.  Buy the tools you need to do the work. This means technical and domain training, software, hardware, process development, new staff,... basically whatever you need to make the work happen. You&#x27;re at the point where long term investments are highly likely to pay off, because your scope is so large and your timeline is entirely in front of you.<p>I&#x27;d also highly recommend working this problem from two angles. You can understand the existing system by looking at the code, but you also need to clearly understand the system requirements from the &#x27;business&#x27; point of view. If you&#x27;re doing bottom-up analysis, then some other group needs to be doing top-down. Along those lines, you should also start to thinking about deployment strategies. I highly recommend avoiding a big bang deployment of that large of a system, so there will be some period of time when you&#x27;re liable to be running both the &#x27;old world&#x27; and the &#x27;new world&#x27; systems at the same time.  Think about how you want to do that...<p>There is lots to think about here, because this is a complex problem.  Hopefully, I&#x27;ve given you at least a little bit to think about.  Good luck.",1409666319

I&#x27;m not questioning how adequate the semantics of the label are, but rather how adequately our legal framework captures reality here.<p>Sometimes reality evolves in ways such that the legal framework around it needs to be updated/re-evaluated. There&#x27;s nothing wrong with that, and it&#x27;s part of the democratic process.<p>That&#x27;s all I&#x27;m saying, and I fail to see any formal, moral or legal issue with this.<p>> It goes straight back into circulation as investments or bank deposits.<p>Some of the money in bank deposits effectively is in a &quot;money bin&quot;.

Taking away money, in order to ensure a steady supply of goods and services, improves the situation for everyone.<p>> or even something really unproductive like feeding their children or receiving medical treatment!<p>Having a growing and healthy workforce is in any society&#x27;s best interest, and a large part of its competitive advantage. Which is in part why children are subsidized by the governement in so many ways. After all, what&#x27;s point of money if there&#x27;s no one to exchange it with?<p>At the same time though we must figure out how to maintain this growth in a sustainable fashion - and I doubt that the optimal solution here is to simply hand people more purchasing power.<p>--<p>You, much like the author of the article, seem to fail to understand that there&#x27;s no perfect answer here. This is an issue that needs fixing, and there seem to generally exist 2 solutions, both of which present a compromise.<p>While we currently don&#x27;t have all the data necessary to make that decision, the article clearly seems to prefer one of those 2 alternatives while carelessly neglecting the negative impacts of it.<p>I on the other hand think that it&#x27;s worthwile, for everyone, to consider the negative aspects too, before rushing to a conclusion.

You&#x27;ve got modern ideas, and trying to apply them to a 20-year-old environment. Its not &#x27;like&#x27; a lot of things; it came before them so the most you could say is, those things are like BASIC.</i><p>Except what you&#x27;ve described is exactly what I described with Bash ;)<p><i>> What BASIC was, was an extremely accessible try-it-now environment that needed no installation, no setup, no environment variables, no directory structure. It was what we thought of when we thought of interpreters, as opposed to compilers. But then interpreters got all file-oriented and broken too.</i><p>Again, all that is comparable with Bash:<p>1. Bash doesn&#x27;t need any installation with most UNIX-like systems. But even in the rare example that Bash isn&#x27;t bundled with your OS, there&#x27;s the Bourne Shell (sh) or even Windows cmd.exe (for all it&#x27;s faults).<p>2. Bash et al doesn&#x27;t require any set up.<p>3. Environmental variables are just global OS variables and since BASIC wasn&#x27;t namespaced, all variables were effectively environmental variables.<p>4. Directories are a file system thing, not a language thing. However it&#x27;s worth noting that many BASIC systems did have a directory structure even if though (at that point) nested subdirectories didn&#x27;t really exist. You could have different storage devices that were switchable (akin to changing drive letter in DOS) and you could store multiple files on an particular medium. In fact I still have a stack of floppy disks for an Amstrad CPC 464 (which ran Locamotic BASIC) in my attic that would testify to this.<p>5. Bash et al are interpreters.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I romanises about the old days too. They were fun. But I don&#x27;t think you can blanket say <i>&quot;[it&#x27;s a] 20-year-old environment. Its not &#x27;like&#x27; a lot of things&quot;</i> just to dismiss any arguments you dislike.",1409664723

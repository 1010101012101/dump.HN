I actually think it was really inappropriate that you were down-voted. The notion that you should have to produce material definitions for concepts presented as fundamentally non-material is tautologically absurd. It&#x27;s basically a rude way of suggesting that you shouldn&#x27;t present that view here. I think, absent some success by materialists, presenting <i>non-material</i> notions of an apparent thing is utterly acceptable. Not only that yours was on topic and directly in response to a comment you apparently read and attempted to respond to earnestly.",1437209953

This approach that takes the first third of the time presenting the problem to an audience that arrived to hear the solution to a known problem can sometimes be annoying.

9906953,story,,,2,0,loser777,"Ask HN: What's a good, short, gig for an incoming CSE PhD student?",,"I very recently wrapped up undergrad* in EE and am planning on starting my PhD in CSE in the fall. I was one of those who decided not to pursue an internship this summer so that I could &quot;take some time off and relax.&quot; I figured that I could occupy my interests with a few side projects/travel/what have you. Well, roughly a month and four side projects (http://68.5.231.239:8080/index.php?swag=side_projects) later--including a personal site redesign, 4chan API exploration, OpenCL hack, and 80s sound chip exploration I&#x27;ve come to realize that some extra $ would be nice for some projects that require more &quot;hardware.&quot;<p>Basically, I&#x27;m looking for something that has a modest multiplier on minimum wage (goal is $2k-$3k in 6  weeks or fewer working close to full time hours). My experience is roughly at a jack of all trades, master of none level. I&#x27;ve gone as far down as doing layout of ALUs in Cadence to as far up as prototyping Android UIs in XML. I&#x27;m familiar with the typical garden variety of languages {C, C++, Python, Java, OCaml, Lisp, MATLAB} and dabbled with things such as {OpenMP, MPI, OpenCL, NumPy, scikit-learn}. I also have some hands on tech experience--assembling x86 PCs, soldering, fixing phones, etc.<p>My ideal target is something that doesn&#x27;t require a lot of insider knowledge or momentum, which in my opinion rules out things such as mechanical turk or oDesk-like services. I&#x27;d also like to be in a position where I&#x27;m not 100% customer facing e.g. being an Uber driver or negotiating my rates all the time.<p>Location: Southern California if that makes a difference<p>*I went to a large public school so I don&#x27;t have a diploma yet though I&#x27;ve passed all my requirements and things are being processed",1437207191

You can explain it to them, but why would they believe you?<p>It&#x27;d be different if a company published the salaries from the start, but switching after growing to a huge size can be very disruptive, and I don&#x27;t blame managers for avoiding opening that can of worms.<p>(Again, I don&#x27;t believe the salaries at Google <i>are</i> perfectly fair, I&#x27;m talking about an hypothetical company)",1437206578

When things are expensive people seem more likely to engage in them out of necessity than convenience. But when things are cheap people become more careless about employing them. While it is desirable that in a situation where you are already fighting a war and have no choice about it you have the best weapons, and the highest chance of victory, it is not necessarily desirable – in terms of thought that is put into employing violence as a tool to resolve a dispute – that before the war you have access to those things.<p>While it is madness to suggest that in a war people will not use their most effective weaponry, the relative costs of war influence who is going to become your enemy in the first place and the scope of the wars that you will fight. Consequently as the technological disparity increases, and the cost of war against any particular foe decreases, it becomes more important to enforce greater discretion in the use of those weapons by other means - and in some cases it would naturally follow that if you really are enforcing greater discretion in the use of weapons there are some situations in which you do not use them when you otherwise would.<p>Simply because you have a weapon does not mean you use it in every case.",1437206475

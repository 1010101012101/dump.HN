Here are some other cases:<p>You absolutely need to run program X, which only runs on English version of Windows. (Developers of program X do not know nor care about internationalization). Therefore you run English version of Internet Explorer.<p>Older versions of Internet Explorer only sends language(en) without sending locale(en-US). You speak English, live in England (or India), and don&#x27;t want to get US page.<p>You are bilingual (remember, lots of people outside US are bilingual), for example live in India and speak English and &quot;mother tongue&quot; very well.

Robert Shiller, for example, has noted that one factor that led to the housing bubble in the US is that it&#x27;s quite hard to short housing.<p>So yes, in general, an increase in the ability to short a commodity will, ceteris paribus, result in an reduction in its propensity to form bubbles.  On the other hand, bitcoins are a bit weird.  The obvious uses for bitcoins are basically illegal drugs and evading currency controls, both of which open bitcoin up to significant legal and regulatory risks.",1386853157

6894162,comment,6893971,6894101,5,0,skriticos2,,,"I don&#x27;t think so for two reasons:<p>1. Bitcoins already underwent several corrections (last one only a few days ago). These small &quot;crashes&quot; later resulted in longer, more stable phases. These substantial downturns flush out most bubble activity. (Bubbles usually go up until they burst. Bitcoin is generally all over the place. Very un-bubble like. When a bubble crashes, it&#x27;s pretty much done for. When Bitcoin crashes, it&#x27;s two weeks of wild swings and then soften on a new baseline.)<p>2. Bitcoin is an erratically growing commodity / currency. If Bitcoin succeeds long-term, then it&#x27;s hopelessly undervalued currently (just because of the limited supply). If not, it&#x27;s not worth anything. Basically it has a high risk associated with it and no safety net or more traditional baseline measure you could work with. This inevitably results in erratic price swings no matter what you do. For instance, the current price is mostly due to China getting into the game. There are still many other countries that are not even on the playing field. No financial instrument could prepare you if the demand rises because another big interest wave comes (like India) and the price needs to find a new equilibrium a magnitude higher.<p>Considering that Bitcoin got a value increase of 24543% in the past 2 Years, it&#x27;s course corrections are outright tame.",1386853021

You can bury it, put it in a safe, or keep it in a secure storage in a safe. Not for daily use.<p>Whenever you need funds, or you want to put away some savings, you open the safe, access your wallet and make a transfer. After that, you put the big wallet in the safe again.<p>Do not keep you millions in the open, do not walk around with them, do not trust them to somebody else (online wallets), do not handle them carelessly, do not throw them to the trash!<p>One thing that does not get mentioned very often in this context is: you can make as many copies of your wallet as you want to! You can even encrypt your wallet-copies with whatever mechanism you want to. Send your wallet encryption-key to your aunt, in case you happen to lose it. You will be able to decrypt any of the dozen copies of your wallet that you are keeping in different places.<p>Encrypting your wallet gives you extra security that it won&#x27;t be stolen, and having multiple copies ensures that you will not lose it.<p>Bitcoin can be <i>a lot of things</i>, that is what makes it so special.

It would require a fair amount of work to update each package manager to talk it (optionally), and agree on the semantics and policies of the protocol, but I think the benefits could be huge.<p>Using Nix/Guix as the basis for such protocol would probably be ideal due to the immutable nature of packages and ability to install side-by-side versions, and that you can specify an identity of a dependency, rather than rely on fuzzy matching of name and version.",1386851619

6894082,comment,6893756,6893979,10,0,rjknight,,,"My reading of the situation is this:<p>In the beginning, feminists were concerned with how women were being directly oppressed by men.  They fought against this, and laws were changed and social norms were changed, and now things are better than they were.<p>As feminism has advanced, it has climbed a pyramid somewhat akin to Maslow&#x27;s hierarchy[1]; as concerns about the most basic rights have been addressed, attention shifts to other matters, to questions that one might describe as &quot;academic&quot; or intellectual in nature - it&#x27;s no longer just about freedom from violence and the right to vote, own property or control one&#x27;s own body, it&#x27;s about ideas and beliefs and questions which are both very <i>fundamental</i> to society but also somewhat <i>abstract</i> - philosophy, in other words.<p>At this point, it&#x27;s not unreasonable for feminists to want to re-open questions that have been settled in Western thought for centuries, on the basis that the settlement was reached almost entirely by men, and many of these men would have held sexist views which could have influenced their conclusions.  Some of these re-openings will prove to be pointless - it might turn out that sexism is orthogonal to the question of logic anyhow.  But it&#x27;s worth checking, just to be sure.  And some of the re-openings may turn out to be very useful and important.<p>What this is <i>not</i> is a question about Dennis Ritchie&#x27;s beard.  There&#x27;s no such thing as a sexist transistor or a patriarchal processor.  But our notions of how these things work, of how they <i>ought</i> to work, and what questions are worth asking and which are irrelevant, those things <i>are</i> shaped by history, and we need to step back and consider the paths <i>not</i> chosen, because there may be possibilities deserving of consideration there.  (This is basically what Bret Victor keeps telling us[2]).<p>This is kinda why I don&#x27;t really understand the geek vs feminist antagonism that everyone seems to take for granted around these parts.  The feminist perspective is an outsider perspective that seeks to understand the true workings of the world, asks questions that others find awkward, disrupts outmoded institutions where necessary, and seeks to empower those who are often misunderstood and mistreated by society.  <i>That is also exactly the geek perspective</i>.<p>There are, of course, plenty of pretty terrible feminists who do want to make an issue out of Dennis Ritchie&#x27;s beard.  I think it helps to think of them as being to feminists as brogrammers are to geeks.<p>[1]: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs</a>\n[2]: <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/71278954\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://vimeo.com/71278954</a>",1386851348

This leads to bubbles of much greater variance than if those who currently wait out bubbles could reasonably bet against global stupidity.<p>Instead, I&#x27;m sitting on tons of cash while equity is overvalued throughout the world, and blowhards are plowing their life savings into computational fiat (think about it).<p>We do live in quite the world, don&#x27;t we?<p>To societal collapse and global failure.",1386850591

I used to be quite good at C++ and Perl and then I was asked to move to Java and these days I work with Scala + Java. In between, I also learned quite a bit about my domain (financial industry / trading), and ended up getting good at R in the process. Now, I will probably not pass a C++ interview! :-)<p>At the same time, if I had access to good notes (that I made), it will all come back pretty fast. For example, I picked up the &quot;C++ FAQs&quot; book by Cline, Lomow and Girou from my bookshelf as I was typing this and as I thumb through it, I am experiencing a lot of, &quot;Ah, right, I remember this now&quot;.<p>> I already know that I want to do programming for the rest of my life, so should I pick one language/technology and stick to that and learn it very-very deeply, pick up one and two beside that, or should I go all-in and learn every language as much as possible?<p>I would say learn one language VERY well AND make notes. Then the rest can often be learned by comparison quickly. The problem is that many times, your employer,a Lead Architect, etc; may decide the language for you, and you may not have that much say...What&#x27;s worse is being asked to move back and forth between related languages, which can be quite confusing!<p>My conclusion is that both you and I should probably start using Anki or other memory-aiding software to make notes as we learn! Here&#x27;s a great article by Derek Sivers on &quot;Memorizing a programming language using spaced repetition software&quot; : <a href=\"http://sivers.org/srs\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://sivers.org/srs</a>. I&#x27;ve read that article a month ago or so and have been meaning to finally start using Anki along with my Functional Programming in Scala coursera course, but somehow didn&#x27;t.<p>However, note that some people make an entire career out of being a guru at one thing. In this path, one key element (that took me too long to grok) is : don&#x27;t just learn, WRITE about it. Blog about what you learned. Even better, write a book about it, attend conferences, etc; That is the way to extract the maximum return for the effort you placed in learning one thing deep down to the metal! When you meet people in person, it opens up opportunities that are exponentially better than merely going to a job search engine!<p>That was quite rambling; I hope there is something of use to you in there!",1386849751

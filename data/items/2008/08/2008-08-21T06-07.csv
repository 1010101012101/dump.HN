282415,comment,281310,282246,0,0,earthboundkid,,,"> I suppose it's easier to read Plato than to study evolutionary psychology or game theory.<p>Uh, no.<p>Plato wasn't writing a textbook. You're not supposed to read it and accept it and be done. You're supposed to fight back with Socrates on every page, and this is the mental training that is supposed to make you able to be your own Socrates. As such, Plato seems really boring to most modern people who read it, since they're reading it wrong. ""Why would Socrates say that? That's clearly wrong. Oh well, I guess he was dumb.""<p>> Modern biology tells us the soul doesn't survive death any more than 'treeness' survives the fireplace.<p>I would be very interested in hearing any evidence that you could give to support these two assertions. In particular, I'm curious as to why you think the concept of a tree can be destroyed by destroying an individual tree. That seems like spooky action at a distance to me...",1219301019

But a few years ago, they were obnoxious.<p>One time, I was ordered to consolidate my luggage -- just before the point at which we take our laptops out and reshuffle items into the bins to put them through the X-Ray.  WTF?  The number of items you are going to take on the plane is not their business!  It's the airline's.  According to the procedures they make you follow, it's actually their business to make you take your luggage apart.<p>Perhaps it's coincidence, but I'm encountering fewer of these bullies.  I wonder if enough people complained about them.",1219300745

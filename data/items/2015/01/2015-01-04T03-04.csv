This way I know we are communicating about the same thing.<p>God throws a few temper tantrums in the Old Testament. Either way the Christian God is not the God I might believe in. I sometimes believe in a creator who, for the purposes of familiarity, I call God.<p>> &quot;Overly worried&quot; - I know of no text in all of the Bible that portrays God as anxious about anything. Maybe you mean to say &quot;chronically concerned with&quot; what people think?<p>Yeah, that is what I meant. I will change that, thanks.<p>> The categories of love and hate as you are discussing seem to require a little work. Whenever we see God&#x27;s unchanging love discussed, at least Scripturally, to what does it refer? And if God chose not to love, would that make Him less than divine somehow?<p>I don&#x27;t personally believe the scriptures are anything but contradictory pseudo-history combined with fiction, so I cannot answer your question.<p>> &quot;Humans are arrogant and we project our own humanness onto everything&quot; -- that is utterly true. Thank you for acknowledging it. But could it be you are projecting your own preferences of what God would be like if He existed? How do you escape this human flaw while the rest of us can&#x27;t or won&#x27;t?<p>Of course, I am. I can only maybe accept that there was a creator. Everything else is just pure speculation. I&#x27;d like to think that this creator is unfathomable to mankind. That being said, I often doubt that this creator exists at all.<p>> By the way, if God turns out to be real and He is preeminently concerned with what you think about Him, what grounds would have to object to His preoccupation with making you see how ultimate and satisfying He is?<p>Well if he was right in front of me I would obviously admit I was wrong. If he cares as much as you say I&#x27;m sure he&#x27;d be pretty upset at me. At that point he would either have to understand where I was coming from, or send me to hell.<p>Either way, I&#x27;m willing to take that risk.",1420343718

8833215,comment,8832943,8832943,0,0,hnriot,,,"This is a rather pointless debate but I have to agree that OSX is getting too &quot;consumer&quot; for this audience. I have a Thinkpad and it runs Linux great. A lot of the problems people here refer to are really where they should be on a consumer operating system. I&#x27;ve noticed this over recent years, hiring new intake from the top schools every year has seen a change. When I ask them what they want for their development machine. It used to be Macs with a sprinkling of Linux/Thinkpad but now I see most going for Windows 7. Since all of our software is linux based the client machine only needs to be able to run ssh sessions but it&#x27;s interesting how many hard core developers want consumer operating systems. I&#x27;d not dream of doing work anything other than a Unix system, but maybe that&#x27;s just because I&#x27;ve grown up with it. Starting out with HP-UX on HP-9000 machines, Apollo, Next, NetBSD, Netware, etc etc. When my machine doesn&#x27;t work the way I want it I generally know how to fix it on Linux. For the majority of people using a consumer operating system that has nice gui tools for changing things is usually better unless you know what you&#x27;re doing.<p>Coming back to ditching OSX, the recent Chrome/Netflix ability has made a big difference for me. That was the one last thing that was a pain, it was always possibly, but not always very reliable and a little tedious, but now there&#x27;s nothing left (besides of course Photoshop) that doesn&#x27;t run on Linux. It&#x27;s really less about the operating system and more about what you want to run, if it&#x27;s games then windows, if it&#x27;s designer/photographer then OSX, if it&#x27;s nerd (git/gcc/python etc) then it&#x27;s linux.",1420343481

This is no different than people objecting to using the word literally to emphasize a figurative expression.<p>To your other point, I&#x27;m not against reappropriating words in different contexts to describe ideas metaphorically.  In this particular case, isomorphic is already defined in a programming/math context.  You&#x27;re not so much reappropriating a definition to a new contract as you&#x27;re making an existing word sound more ambiguous in the same context by diluting it.  I think the reason people are so passionate about not diluting this term is because they want people to understand and really appreciate the value of isomorphisms.

When the Westerners drained the colonies of natural resources, the ones who were colonized got no benefit from that whatsoever. That was pure exploitation. (It will be very interesting indeed if you argue otherwise.) However, when educated immigrants from under-developed nations are hired in a developed country, the immigrants can 1) have a much better quality of life; 2) send money back home to their families; 3) can use what they learn to go back to their home countries and start businesses there (if they so choose). Thus, the immigrants, and their countries of origin, are being helped. <i>Most</i> people from the third world will tell you the same. But (hopefully) no one is going to say that the Scramble for Africa was a good thing. And I doubt that the Africans thought it was good thing when it was going on.<p>But going back to the argument you&#x27;re making -- &quot;people have various ideas floating around in their heads. They remember outsourcing, where American programmers ended up with no power and no money. This didn&#x27;t do much for the prestige of the career. They think of nerds, obviously, who aren&#x27;t too great on social norms.&quot; Hmm, maybe. But this [1] article argues, with some interesting charts, that interest in CS education is increasing. The Chair in Computer Science & Engineering at the UW argues that &quot;Kids are waking up. Every field is becoming an information field, and if you can program at a level beyond an intro course, it’s a huge value to you.&quot;  The CS department chair at Harvey Mudd College says &quot;Students feel that computing is socially relevant and even hip.&quot;<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.geekwire.com/2014/analysis-examining-computer-science-education-explosion/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.geekwire.com/2014/analysis-examining-computer-sci...</a>",1420343279

Below is mine,<p>Guitar Practice: I do repertoire, technique and improvisation. For repertoire, I usually focus on the hardest passage and run it three times to the best ability and then connect the whole song together for 3 goes before I finish. For technique, I usually rotate on scales patterns/licks/ear training; review the last pattern I learned and learn a new pattern. For improvisation, I just doodle with jam track and listen and try to iterate on how I can improve (e.g., better timing on stressing notes on chord changes, building tension).<p>Dota Practice: I sometimes watch youtube casts on warding and laning.

Too bad because they undoubtedly had the best OS ever.<p>I remember seeing a few posts here and there where people complained about performance degrading each time they upgraded OS X. My last 3 laptops had been Mac&#x27;s (a White Macbook, then a Macbook Pro from 2010, then a Retina Macbook Pro from these days...) and while I feel &#x27;satisfied&#x27; I also kind of noticed that performance is always worse, and somehow the more I upgrade, the more I feel like a pain the ass when I use that computer. Since there are no serious benchmarks on to this (I wonder why) I always thought that it was more of a &#x27;feeling&#x27; than something real, or that maybe, sure there was a bit more lag but I&#x27;m running more &#x27;advanced&#x27; software.<p>So yeah, that was me dreaming about how $4,000+ dollars on laptops had not gone down the drain when I paid a visit to an old friend. I asked my friend to borrow his computer because I needed to check an email and he did. Old friend&#x27;s Macbook is one of these [1], that is, a laptop that wasn&#x27;t even top of the line TEN YEARS AGO. I&#x27;ve opened and became surprised that battery still worked. &quot;Dude, have you ever replaced the battery on this?&quot; &quot;Nope&quot; &quot;Weird, maybe he just doesn&#x27;t use it too much&quot;... Laptop woke up almost immediately, it had OS X Tiger running... Tiger... not even leopard.<p>And then I started using it... HOLY F<i></i>* (excuse the expletives) I WISH MY F<i></i>* RETINA MACBOOK WORKED LIKE THAT. Everything was smooth, Firefox opened like immediately (no SSD obv. but ok maybe it was already on RAM), I was able to finish my work and read a few articles and I felt really comfortable the whole time, and I want to clarify on this, I didn&#x27;t felt that I was using a computer to do my work, that was kind of the magic that Apple products used to have (all of them, even iPods...). Now I&#x27;m always like, oh I gotta do this, click ... wait ... open this ... wait ... send this ... wait ... change this setting ... wait. Now I can state it for sure, Apple is really screwing it up on its software.<p>I haven&#x27;t dropped Apple because fortunately for them, most other laptops feel even worst (at least they haven&#x27;t screwed the trackpad yet...) but as soon as a well-made Linux notebook appears I&#x27;m out.<p>[1] <a href=""http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/24/MacBook_Pro_situated_on_a_wooden_table.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/24/MacBook_P...</a>",1420341903

8833119,comment,8832943,8832943,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I have primarily used Linux on the desktop, and then laptop, since 1995. It wasn&#x27;t always painless. Still occasionally is not painless. But, neither is Mac OS X or Windows, and the Linux desktop/laptop experience is, by far, the best it&#x27;s ever been. The pain just takes different shapes, and I&#x27;ve never seriously considered switching to Windows or Mac for my primary OS, though I&#x27;ve always had a Windows partition available to boot into and I&#x27;ve occasionally had a Hackintosh to play with.<p>When it comes down to it, the conveniences Linux gives me far overshadow the minor pains of having to Google hardware before I buy it to make sure there are drivers. Even on this front, I&#x27;ve almost completely stopped doing it...I&#x27;ve bought several pieces of hardware on a whim in the past few years without thinking, &quot;Oh, wait, will this work?&quot; then plugging it in and have it Just Work. No driver installation, no Googling for errors, just a working camera, sound card, MIDI controller, etc. The major hardware makers, like GPU and network vendors, are all on board. If you buy quality hardware, it is almost certainly gonna work with Linux (and all that old hardware that stopped working with Windows several years ago, due to no new drivers, is still working in modern Linux; this is true for me of two 24 bit audio interfaces, and a MIDI controller).<p>The command line experience of Linux is simply superior to the alternatives. Mac OS has bash, sure, but all the stuff is in the wrong place with crazy long paths, and all of the software is installed via ornery dysfunctional package bundles from Apple (or from an alternative source, like MacPorts or similar; I truly hate the package management situation on Mac OS X). The command line feels clumsy and bolted on, even though there&#x27;s UNIX at the core of Mac OS X.<p>Actually, a huge part of it probably comes down to package management, for me. Package management is so bad on Windows and Mac OS X, and so good on Linux (yum and apt are just really excellent), that I feel a little dirty installing stuff on those platforms. Being able to choose from thousands of packages, especially developer packages, having all the Perl modules I use already packaged and easy to install, having all the Go and node stuff packaged up nicely and ready for tinkering, having a lot of the system built on Python and shell scripts with the source readily available, all of this stuff just adds up to a tinkerers dream.<p>I feel like I learn something new when I figure out problems on Linux; I feel like I&#x27;m being punished when I run into problems on Mac OS X or Windows, even if I get them solved. It&#x27;s just such a different feeling. I&#x27;m sure for someone who isn&#x27;t technically minded, the experience would be the same...an opaque system that isn&#x27;t working right. But, for me, when I&#x27;m able to patch something and send it off to the maintainer, I feel happy and content. I feel frustration when I run into problems on Mac OS X or Windows. All systems of the size and complexity of a modern OS have problems, it&#x27;s just a difference of how they get resolved that makes the difference.",1420341719

8833073,comment,8830013,8832448,0,0,alixander,,,"Negative or not, I really appreciate the constructive criticism.<p>In response to your comments on watch: Indeed, right now it only identifies AST nodes of type &quot;asgn&quot;. I imagine other mutations like append and others have different types too, I just haven&#x27;t gotten around to implementing that. My bad for posting this in a pre-release state.<p>&quot;Even if you modified the code to support this, you wouldn&#x27;t be able to control access everywhere that piece of data went.&quot;
I can see two potential solutions:
1. Identifying nodes of type &quot;call&quot; that have a watched variable as an arg, and then adding an if statement to check if it has changed and printing it only if it has.
2. Analyzing AST of ThirdPartyLib.do_stuff(arg1), identify statements that mutate arg1, and logging a change after the call in the original program if arg1 is changed. This way even if the value isn&#x27;t changed, it&#x27;s still logged because it was mutated (or at least attempted to), which is probably more desirable than solution 1.<p>In response to Mock: Aside from Mock, people have told me they prefer the logging library, pdb, IDEs, etc. for debugging. PyScribe isn&#x27;t meant to be a separate method of debugging, I intended it to supplement my preferred way, which is just using print statements. Might be it&#x27;s not the most powerful, but its purpose isn&#x27;t to compete with other methods of debugging.",1420341162

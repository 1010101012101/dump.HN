In the last years I only had one shocking encouter with a HP laptop (Compaq brand) and don't really know what the others are doing. I know that my good old ThinkPad came (five years ago) in a pretty clean state (but I found all the custom stuff - special buttons HUD, trackpad confuguration  and so on - to be not very polished.)<p>It's really a shame. The hardware is not so bad. Build quality is ok (ThinkPads: great!). The price is great. I would feel only a bit terrible if I were forced to switch my MBP with a HP laptop based on hardware alone. It's the software. Yeah, you can solve all this. But that's something annoying I want to avoid. And that is worth quite a bit of money.",1261490889

1009891,comment,1009789,1009789,0,0,Aegean,,,"Really good point. By nature of my startup, I have to achieve highly complex tasks in short time. These are heavyweight tasks that require high precision design decisions and, I often find the following two things happen to me in cycles:<p>1.) I feel highly motivated to achieve the task, and I become a very high achiever. I finish a task in 2-3 days that would otherwise be achieved by inefficient communication and discussion of a 5-employee team in a month. I do this without feeling any obligation to do it and without thinking about schedules, startup deliverables etc. I concentrate solely on the design problem and the reward of achieving it. I feel rewarded when it is finished. It feels like a celebration of the mind's capabilities.<p>2.) I look ahead and start planning about deliverables and deadlines. Since the tasks are so overwhelming on their own, the overall project looks very complicated. I feel overwhelmed, freaked out, and immediately stop having progress. I also start to have stress-related health degradation signs, and I get into  an unproductivity cycle that is very hard to break.<p>I got this so many times that now I try hard to find ways to keep myself in (1) without going into (2). I find that keeping my focus on the challenge but not the time schedule helps. Think of it this way, if you stay in (1), you will get very timely progress anyway, so no need to think about schedules and deadlines.<p>It is also ironic how the same task may look so overwhelming and so much fun in different perspectives. It is actually fun that becomes your hell when you get schedules, deadlines, competitors and finance in the loop.",1261490840

I think the key fact is that they are doing that about their work time, not their play time.

It's been a long time since I tried out Opera properly last time, but I have to say this new release is snappy, smooth and very, very clean.

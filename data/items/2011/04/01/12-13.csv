2395989,comment,2385424,2385424,1,0,am_a_droid,,,"Hello Mr. Schroeter,<p>I have enjoyed your post on DZone (<a href=""http://www.dzone.com/links/r/hiring_developers_youre_doing_it_wrong.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dzone.com/links/r/hiring_developers_youre_doing_i...</a>) and have decided to let you know about it. This topic of 'interviewing the right candidate' has always intrigued me. I have always wondered if the superstars amongst the technology-driven companies have devised a surefire method to pick the right candidate from thousands! In my experience, the decision to go for a candidate or not, is very subjective as you have mentioned. At a certain point in time during the interview, one listens to a inner voice and decides between 'Yeah!' or 'Nah!' and not always that decision is based on pure facts: precise answers to precise questions. But, to know the personality of a programmer - through some questions and possible answers in an hour's conversation - is a difficult task. You have not mentioned if you had cracked it finally in your star-up or your later efforts/engagements. I will be keen to know.<p>I am based in India currently. Here, because of the business success of the IT Service companies, most of the companies try to follow their business model. However, about 95% of the work that these companies take up are low-tech, mostly repetitive and disincentivize breakthrough technical work. Their need for good programmers is not much; they are content to see that the client is that much happy to keep the projects continuing: that is the main objective. Moreover, you seem to say that 'scaling' is not an insurmountable problem. It probably is, if you see that the Indian IT service companies cite hiring figures in tens of thousands in an year. So, the interview process that these companies stick to, aims to find out how much is  the probability that the candidate is going to prove himself a misfit. Subjective, as usual; for a good measure, the companies take in people in huge numbers simply hoping that the probability of a 'good fit' increases. For a bit more experienced people, it is almost always aimed to find out if the candidate can 'manage' a team, and certainly not whether the candidate understands the world of programming at all.<p>I work as a freelancer and in India, that doesn't help me. I claim to know and understand what it takes to 'design' and 'develop' a good piece of software. More than that, I carry a certain amount of intensity about the whole act of programming and usefulness of well-written programs, even at this advanced age. However, that doesn't interest most of the potential employers because a good programmer - who knows some but is eager to work in a team where people know more than he does - is not valued as much. Importantly, it requires a keen pair of eyes to spot these qualities and that is largely  missing.<p>Recently, situation here has made me so despondent that I have begun to look for opportunities outside India, Europe in particular (I have stayed and worked there before, hence the bias). I am hoping that there will be some people out there who will take some interest in not only what I know and have done, but how fast I can know more and can do if I join them. I am looking for those keen pair of eyes. Agreed that there are those issues of geographical distance and visa papers etc., but if someone finds me suitable, s/he may want to go that extra mile.<p>If you have read till this point, thanks for your patience. I read your post at a moment when I was in despair and wanted to demonstrate that your post chimed with me.<p>Warm regards<p>-- Nirmalya (sengupta.nirmalya@gmail.com)<p>-- \nSoftware Technologist\n<a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/nirmalyasengupta"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.linkedin.com/in/nirmalyasengupta</a>",1301662735

About two years ago a company called Nycomed managed, with lies and deception, to get a monopoly on selling Melatonin in Scandinavia by convincing our governmental medical products agencies that Melatonin was harmful and had severe side-effects - of course, all Melatonin but their own magic kind, marketed under the name Circadin. Before their ""coup"", I could purchase 30 tablets  2mg Melatonin for 5. Nycomed wants 22 for 21 of their 2mg tablets.

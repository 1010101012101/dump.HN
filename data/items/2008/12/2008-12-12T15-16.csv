However, what about the actual human beings that will not have jobs, and their children?  Detroit is already starting to look like a third world country.  What will it be like by the time all three auto makers get through the bankruptcy procedure?<p>I think the argument for a ""bailout"" for the people who still support it is that it is simply cheaper to keep the auto companies alive a little while longer than what the government would pay out in benefits for all of the resulting unemployed workers.  And that it is a more efficient ""stimulus"" than the government just spending money on other projects directly.  Maybe we will have to pay those benefits eventually in any case.  But as bad as things are now it might actually make sense to keep the auto companies alive, even for just another year or so, while the rest of the economy maybe starts to improve.<p>You can argue that we should be more libertarian about these things, and the government should not be involved in ""social safety nets"" or whatever.  But that is not the government we have, and it is not going to be the government we have any time soon.  Given that, the question of whether a bail out is cost effective from the federal government's standpoint is not as clear cut.",1229097271

395728,comment,395621,395621,0,0,mdasen,,,"Why has no one pointed out that implementing WiFi on wireless frequencies that aren't the b/g 2.4GHz or the a 5GHz won't work with any existing WiFi devices?<p>Basically, this is a free, new wireless data service that requires new equipment purposes (should it go through).  It would also be a service with near no bandwidth.  Wireless is a shared resource.  That's one of the reasons its slower than hard lines.  If I was the only user on AT&T's HSDPA tower nearest me, I could easily pull data speeds better than my cable connection, but that isn't the case.  I'm broadcasting to the tower and the tower is broadcasting to me - even though it really isn't a broadcast, but a single connection.  If we're talking about taking a small amount of spectrum to set this up, it won't even be 700k.  100k would be lucky, dial-up speeds or lower the likely.<p>In terms of providing ""free"" access to schools, etc.  it really isn't free since it requires new equipment.  In fact, it's really expensive.<p>I'd argue that the FCC should do the same thing they did with the Google open access auction.  Put a reserve price on the auction.  If no carrier is willing to pay $5bn for it with the restriction that they offer free wireless to everyone on 25% of the spectrum, then it's re-auctioned without the restriction.<p>Oh, and for the article's author, when you say something like 'It used to be that public resources like land and radio spectrum were leased to private companies by the government so that the ""people"" could profit from their use,' you need to realize that we do profit from companies paying lots of money in licensing fees since that's government revenue that doesn't need to come from my pocket and it's a win as long as companies don't overcharge for the product.",1229096400

As Clay Shirky demonstrates here, the sermon can be the most uplifting and inspiring and motivating form of communication we have.  Turning off the brain is not inherent in the form at all, quite the opposite.<p>As another example, Barack Obama's oratory is undeniably influenced and inspired by sermons.  Particularly, the African American sermon, perhaps the highest form of this art.  The obvious example being Martin Luther King, Jr., a good candidate for greatest speaker of the 20th century.<p>And if you don't think Clay Shirky's talk here is sermon like, may I suggest you just haven't heard many sermons, or at least not many good ones.",1229096219

I've worked with startups where the pace was crazy-fast: like, finish that impossible feature that 3 other devs have tried and failed at by tomorrow, because we've got a demo.  I've also worked at variants of this where the pace is the same, but the direction ends up changing every 2 weeks, so you never actually get anything substantive done.  I've worked at startups where you work really fast, in one focused direction, for a long time and then find out it was the <i>wrong</i> direction and jump off a cliff.  I've worked at startups that were really fast in the beginning, and then bogged down as we discovered the problem was much harder than expected.

Tossing people out on the street can still be more merciful than bailing them out, if the bailout fails and you <i>still</i> toss them out onto the street, only into a worse situation. Or, if you further distort the economy to bailout the poor auto workers, you may toss out millions of <i>other</i> people onto the street instead, only not in one recognizable group.<p>The idea that this bailout is free, harmless, and guaranteed to work is wrong on three counts. It's not a choice between ""Save their jobs"" and ""heartlessly cut their jobs"", it's a matter of figuring out <i>where</i> the pain goes and how to minimize it, and there are more stakeholders here than just the autoworkers. Raising taxes to save the autoworkers <i>will</i> drive other businesses out of business and drive other taxpayers over the edge into bankruptcy, and the fact that they are not easily visible doesn't make that less true. Failing to raise taxes means that much more debt, which has its own consequences. (Regardless, you can't get away from opportunity costs.)<p>I believe in free market optimization precisely <i>because</i> I believe it is the most merciful and the best for the autoworkers and <i>everybody else</i> in the medium and long run, and the more you dick with the short run by stealing money from the productive to pay for the unproductive, the worse the medium and long run get.",1229095795

395714,comment,395664,395664,0,0,raffi,,,"I worked for the Air Force Research Lab once as an intern and later while in a uniform.  And now I'm jumping into the startup world.<p>Here are my thoughts:<p>1. If you're in a hot research area--the feeling of being a part of something bigger than yourself and the potential for impact is huge.<p>2. If you're in a hot research area and you're good--FYI good doesn't mean PhD... are you smart and do you get things done?  Bringing ideas to the table helps too.  If you fit these qualifications you'll soar to leadership in your area very quickly.  I saw this happen with contractors, government program managers, and military personnel.  I should note, the bench scientist part of a research organization is mostly flat so soaring to leadership is usually an informal designation.  Still, its nice to see your ideas living and other people working on them either way.<p>3. Again, if you're in a hot research area (and the passion is there), then you'll get to work with cutting edge concepts and live there.  Installing an SVN dump of open source package X is not cutting edge after working in research. At the same time researchers are much like the open source community, a big bulk tends to go in the same direction at the same time until the horse is shot, beaten, and then the bones picked clean.<p>4. Beware of the bureaucracy in a research environment.  It is soul crushing and it will get you.  It can <i>really</i> get in the way of everything you do.<p>5. The research world does offer you the opportunity to be entrepreneurial.  Yes, really!  Do you think you're good?  Do you want your ideas listened to?  Then go write a proposal and get funding.  Getting someone to fund your ideas is incredibly validating (as I'm sure startup folks here will attest to).  If you get enough funding, you can then afford to have people working on your team moving your idea forward.  Maybe you start with a little money and then prove your concept enough to justify more funding later.  Of course making relationships with parties interested in using your research helps too.  Sounds a bit like growing a business doesn't it?<p>6. Oh last thing about research world--if you're willing to lead (if you're willing to start a company, you're willing to lead) then you won't just sit in a cubicle writing code.  You get to write proposals, papers, reports.  You get to go speak.  You get to travel and reach out to other organizations.  You also get to act as door to door salesman, I once went to Korea knocking on doors at US Forces Korea HQ peddling research.  The number of hats you can wear is amazing.<p>I don't advocate doing one or the other.  I do know if I make it in the startup world, I'll probably continue to spin multiple tops on the side, but I'd like to stay in the research world almost as a hobby.  If one could eliminate the bureaucracy then it would be nearly a perfect job.<p>Just remember:<p>There is a big difference between being someone who starts a startup and working as employee #72 in said startup.<p>Likewise in the research world there is a big difference between someone conceiving ideas, trying to get funding, executing on them, and trying to transition the research (sales).  Compare this to enthusiastic computer programmer who just wants to code and is unwilling to take on those other roles.  YMMV<p>Then again, in professional sports, there is a big difference between being a player on the team and selling tickets at the door.  Both are part of the same organization and both have a role to play.<p>In either environment you have to fight to matter but once you've had some success, then you get the freedom to make things happen.<p>Good luck!",1229095648

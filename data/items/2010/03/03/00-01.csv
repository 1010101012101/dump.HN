1163011,comment,1161547,1162921,0,0,strlen,,,"> I'm a bit confused about your last sentence. Are you saying that the dev OSes will cause more outages, but we can automated that they won't be major?<p>I am saying that the ""dev OSes"" (really, I just meant Linux), if not automated, are difficult to manage. However, in a ""worse is better"" sense that means there's wealth of operations tools available for them (e.g., puppet, chef, bcfg2). Linux administrators are extremely used to working with these tools and developing their own.<p>At present web-scale (i.e., no longer a few Ultra-2s for front-end and an E10K for database) if there's no automation, outages are going to happen as result of routine failures (e.g., database master -- or Hadoop namenode -- goes down, there's no automation to fail it over).<p>ZFS snapshots are awesome (I've had a chance to deploy a project to a Solaris environment with ZFS -- and snapshots meant much less worries about data loss). Unfortunately, the only choices for ZFS are FreeBSD and Solaris (I wouldn't try ZFS-Fuse). However, FreeBSD provides no easy way to do <i>many</i> things automatically that are possible in Linux (e.g., no fully un-attended installation, although that's less of a problem with virtualization). Solaris has issues of its own and unfortunately, presently, the biggest issue isn't even technical.",1267577796

EX: Throwing a fastball vs curve ball where the odds of hitting each depend on which was expected.<p>While it's clearly not a stable strategy if everyone did the same thing it's actually fairly hard to consistently beat a basket of randomly chosen stocks.

And why did you think such books would benefit you?<p>If you read the wrong types of books, the ones that do not resonate with your goals, then you will gain nothing. Reading Tolstoy, when your goals are in physics, will seem like a waste of time, a mere pleasure, sort of like <i>watching a movie or taking a walk</i>. But when your goal is to become a good writer, a better teller of stories, then reading Tolstoy can be an epiphany of sorts.

Learning syntax and libraries is easy. Knowing where to apply them and how to architect your program is the really hard part. I'm not sure how you learn that other than experience and for a novice that means countless hours of work before they can produce anything unique and useful.",1267574864

1162927,story,,,2,0,dryicerx,"Ask HN: Incentive Mechanisms to Promote User Activity? (karma/badges, etc)",,"What are you thoughts about various incentive mechanisms to promote users active. There was a interesting talk in #startups last night about this, and I think a bigger audience would find it interesting as well.<p>For example the most basic method is Karma/Points for submission and getting voted up (such as HN, Reddit).<p>A variation of the above system is propagating points from child-to-parent. For example voting a child item/comment will also give points to it's parent (or fraction of a point) to the parent. This way items that start active discussions or activity with child submissions are promoted with more points.<p>Another is a badge/achievement system. StackOverflow is one, where users can collect various type of badges for doing certain things or reaching milestones. (Someone brough up Xbox live as well, where achievements not only for positive aspects, but also for glorious fails... so who knows). A twist on this is not only having badges, but also having badges convert to point values.<p>Collecting or having points them selves imho is not all that useful other than for bragging and/or pulling rank. I think being able to redeem/trade them in for various features or more leverage on a activity in the site is much more useful. For example in SO's case, you can trade in your points for bounties on questions.<p>Did I miss any other major point/incentive type systems? So, what are you thoughts/comments/criticisms regarding this?",1267574520

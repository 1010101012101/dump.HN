I left them and never looked back.<p>Also stay away from Joyent.<p>Depending on your needs, Media Temple might work. And a friend swears by Royalty Hosting although I haven't tried them.<p>I'm playing with Mosso at the moment and they seem good.",1212216809

205147,comment,204240,204240,0,0,gruseom,,,"Myers-Briggs used to annoy me because there were always a lot of questions I could go either way on. The third time I took it I figured out what to do. I divided my answers into two columns. Anytime I had an unambiguous answer, I'd put it in both columns, but if I felt split I'd put opposite answers in each column. I was curious as to whether this would yield interesting results, and it did: I got a 50/50 split in two of the variables (that is, I'm evenly matched in IE and TF), and an extreme bias in the other two (I'm about as N and P as you can get). This matches how I feel about myself pretty well. I found another amusing way to verify the approach: if you combine the opposites to my extremes you get SJ, and the SJs turn out to be my arch-enemies. I read the description of SJ and it makes me squirm and think, why would anybody be like this? These people are neurotic bureaucrats. The world would be better off without them!<p>Edit: I'm joking, of course. SJ is so much my polar opposite that I have a hard time understanding or empathizing with them. I just find it ironically hilarious to read a typology that's designed to foster understanding and find myself dismissing 1/16 of humanity as basically adding no value.<p>Edit 2: As of this moment, the SJs are less than 3% of the respondents to the poll. Evidently I've come to the right place. :)",1212216460

From graphic/ui design/css, to html, to the MVC stack, to the database, to the system administration and the networking.<p>For a startup, being a jack of all trades is far, far more valuable than a specialist.  How much use will a startup have for JUST a programmer that won't touch the database or the servers?  If I'm hiring a developer who is ostensibly going to be coding in Rails all day long, their ability to do design and database work is just as important (if not more-so) than their actual experience in Rails.<p>Take a look at the stack above, and learn more about whichever one you're least comfortable with.  If you've never touched photoshop before, download their 30 day trial and at least familiarize yourself with it (good frequently-used ""beginner's"" task: making a transparent PNG of something like an arrow).  Never set up a linux system?  Clean out that old windows box and install Debian (server) and set it up as a file system.<p>Rinse and repeat.",1212215846

205132,comment,204130,205059,0,0,swivelmaster,,,"Hah!  I listened to LOTS of music, good and bad.  I went to tons of local shows and tried to figure out why the bands that sucked sucked and why the bands that rocked rocked, even when the bands that rocked were playing very simple music.  I also did a whole bunch of recording, and spent a lot of time tweaking settings to try to figure out why my guitars sounded crappy and such.  Eventually I figured out that the solid bands sound 100X better because they know how to get the right sounds from their instruments...  and thus I began learning about amp manufacturers and popular models (can you tell me what the differences are between the distorted tones on a Marshall JCM half stack, a Vox AC30, and a Fender Twin?  What about between pinstripe and coated drum heads?  Picked and fingered bass?  What's a ""scooped"" sound?)<p>And then there's just giving my mixes to people and listening when they tell me what's wrong.",1212215442

205130,comment,205049,205049,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I owned a Lisa when I was in high school (my first ""business"" was buying, repairing, and selling computers, and I found it at a garage sale).<p>It was pretty neat, but I already had an Amiga by then (then being 1989 or so), so wasn't particularly impressed.  What did amaze me, however, was the price of the thing.  The fellow I bought it from had all the receipts for everything: $10k for the Lisa, $7.5k for a 10GB hard disk, $5k for a 5GB hard disk, and about $5k worth of software and ancillary stuff, if I recall correctly.  This sum seemed unbelievably large to me back then...and it <i>was</i> more than the purchase price of both of my parents cars combined.<p>The external hard disks were absolutely massive, and had huge cables.  The other thing I remember is how godawful slow the thing was.  It took forever to boot, and starting applications took forever.  Since it didn't multi-task (which I had already become addicted to using my Amiga), switching between applications was an exercise in frustration.  And, of course, since the Lisa existed for a very short time before the first Mac arrived, it wasn't really a machine one could get software for anymore.  The screen was kinda tiny, too.<p>When we went to the Computer History Museum my girlfriend got a chuckle out of my excitement in the ""PC"" corner of the museum...I kept exclaiming, ""ooh, I had one of those!""",1212215233

Even the middle-of-the-road DACs are indistinguishable from perfection now, and the rest of the circuit is just ensuring that any noise in the power supply and the output traces are below a certain threshold - not trivial, but the industry has built techniques and for doing this in much, much more demanding applications than audio reproduction, and so it&#x27;s not like you have to use exotic components or circuit design techniques.<p>Yes, there&#x27;s lots of crappy audio kit out there, but it&#x27;s not hard to get superfluously good stuff either.<p>I think people just liked the fact that in the 60&#x27;s and 70&#x27;s you could make a hobby out of actively pursuing a better sound in amplifiers, and are disappointed that some time in the 80&#x27;s it became possible to buy gear that was indistinguishable from perfection, and these days it&#x27;s not even expensive.<p>Neil Young should have focused on headphones, or speakers - that&#x27;s an area where there&#x27;s still detectable amounts of distortion.

9282179,comment,9281615,9281973,0,0,Dn_Ab,,,"It depends, some people distinguish <i>economic rent</i> from <i>economic profit</i> by restricting it to economic profits that cannot be reduced to <i>normal</i> by competition in the long run. Some additionally include profits without any opportunity costs.<p>Economic rents run counter to properly functioning markets, e.g. by raising artificial barriers such as patents or counterproductive regulation.<p>The key tenet of perfect competition is that in the long run, only normal profits exist. Since economic rent stands contrary to this, it cannot be a fundamental law of capitalism. In fact, economic rent is a sign of market failure. But this is reality and markets can&#x27;t be perfect, so we try for good tax policies to redress this imbalance.

Utf8 not supported properly in majority of implementations. ( which imo requires getting and using a font that supports the codepoints )<p>Again, a client problem, but I&#x27;ll agree that clients can lie on the actual encoding that is used in emails. Mandating UTF-8 would be such a heaven.<p>> No user index ( saying that you could have an address book also doesn&#x27;t count; and that is a seperate thing which also there is no one spec that is used by all people using email )<p>I don&#x27;t understand.

There&#x27;s not much of a reason for anything to play back at over 96k and many argue 41k is sufficient for mixed/mastered material. Point granted.<p>Please don&#x27;t interpret what I&#x27;m about to say as audiophoolery. I&#x27;m an EE. I haven&#x27;t worked in audio a whole lot, but I&#x27;ve looked at things enough that I feel like I could do a reasonable job at designing a DAC.<p>The one thing that a higher sampling rate does is that it makes good engineering easier. Designing an antialiasing filter that both prevents aliasing and still sounds good at a 41k sample rate is hard. There&#x27;s just not a whole lot of room between your passband and stopband, so you need a really sharp filter. Add in component tolerances, and your sharp filter is probably going to be a set of mediocre tradeoffs.<p>I suspect when the author talks about &quot;smoother treble&quot;, they&#x27;re probably referring to the fact that the anti-aliasing filter doesn&#x27;t need to have a weird phase response to be able work properly.",1427564703

It instilled antipathy towards Irish more than love for Irish in my peers. Making it an optional subject would mean only people who cared would study it, and they would perhaps be more likely to try and use it.",1427564321

I do find it provides a helpful framework for developing and maintaining a bit of perspective, and in reducing anxiety, both of which I&#x27;ve always struggled with.<p>For example, in the context of HN: although I often find the content here inspiring, it can also be intimidating and discouraging. When I read about software engineers making $200k+, five times what I make, it makes me feel as though I&#x27;ve failed, or that I&#x27;m not cut out for the profession. Similarly, when I see the amazing projects, startups, and other technical achievements here, I often feel discouraged because I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;ll ever achieve that.<p>Stoicism focuses on what you have, not what you want. Negative visualization teaches us to appreciate the present: What if I lost the job I have? What if I lost my wife, my family? What if I&#x27;m badly injured and can&#x27;t work at all? In that context, I can appreciate my job, even if it&#x27;s not as good a job as I want. After all, I get paid enough to cover my bills, to sit in a squishy chair and think and solve puzzles. This helps relieve the anxiety I generate by foolishly measuring my self-worth by the yardstick of others&#x27; achievements. Ironically, this doesn&#x27;t rob me of my ambition to improve my lot. Instead, I find that when I am calm and content, I have the energy and focus to do the studying and practice that I believe are necessary to do so. And most importantly: in the meantime, I&#x27;ve given myself permission to be happy today, not on the day in the future when I reach the ever-moving goalposts.

9282068,comment,9281402,9281801,0,0,mcguire,,,"Keep in mind that there are two confounding factors here:<p>1. The conflict between religion and science is at a much deeper level than &quot;evolution&quot; or any other specific question about facts. Religion is based on belief in the absence of (or even in conflict with) evidence. Science is (or should be) based on doubt even in the presence of evidence. (Quick quiz: Did Albert Einstein waste the last half of his life opposing quantum mechanics?)<p>I enjoyed Stephen J. Gould&#x27;s book on the conflict between religion and science, but he rather missed the actual point. (&quot;<i>I make it clear that one can accept evolution and maintain their religious beliefs. They are not mutually exclusive:</i>&quot; yes, at the risk of having to compartmentalize the activities of science and religion; but everyone does that anyway. I like to fancy myself a scientist, but my understanding of most of science is at the level of religion; I don&#x27;t have enough physics to really evaluate <i>evidence</i>, so I&#x27;m just going along based on results. Likewise, I don&#x27;t have the chemistry or the biology. I suspect the vast majority of any scientists or engineers are in a similar boat, although I know too many of both to expect not to be set on fire for this statement. In any case, I&#x27;m mostly going along because I like the results.)<p>2. &quot;Evolution&quot;, on the student side in this article at least, is essentially irrelevant to the lives of the students. (Modulo, of course, the evolutionary medicine points; many of those are as compatible with creationism, though.) This is a course on biology for non-biologists; the facts of biology have no practical, visible effects on their lives. That might change if they go full-crazy and assert something like the immutability of species, but that isn&#x27;t the mainstream of creationist thought. Whether whales descended from a strange, wolfy sort of critter is as irrelevant to non-biologically inclined students as whether whales&#x27; tails are oriented vertically or horizontally to students in Kansas. Or, whether nitrogen compounds are exciting[1].<p>Teaching evolution in these classes is valuable solely because it teaches an understanding of how science works, which (a) most practising scientists don&#x27;t really have but which (b) is kind of important if one is going to be dealing with most policy decisions. Which one is. On the one hand, that makes this class one of the most important that the students could take, but on the other it makes <i>this</i> class one of the least important: I don&#x27;t care if you &quot;believe&quot; in evolution or not if you can make reasonable, reasoned decisions. (Unless you believe the world was created 4000 years ago, all of the evidence otherwise was planted as a trick, <i>and</i> that the god who did so is benevolent. I&#x27;m staying away from that guy.)<p>[1] <a href=""http://pipeline.corante.com/archives/2013/01/09/things_i_wont_work_with_azidoazide_azides_more_or_less.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pipeline.corante.com/archives/2013/01/09/things_i_won...</a>",1427563289

The left design though is objectively inferior:<p>* The text in the right column is centered, rather than aligned, and is thus ragged on both sides, making it harder to read and sloppy-looking.<p>* The leading on &quot;beginner class&quot; yeesh.<p>* The body copy in the left column is set at the same size as the header text in the right column.<p>* The right column has indistinct headers with inadequate contrast.<p>* The right column mixes header signifiers, in some cases using all uppercase, in others bold.<p>* The body copy in the left column uses an oblique sans and the right column uses a similar sans, minimizing contract (notice how the &quot;after&quot; design uses a true italic)<p>* The &quot;sections&quot; in the right column are set off with pointless thin rules, which is a design annoyance so basic that Tufte yells about it early in (iirc) The Visual Display Of Quantitative Information.<p>* The right column has no hierarchy, so the contact information is set in exactly the same prominence as the rest of the information, so clumsily that the URL runs into the margin.<p>I guess I could go on.<p>This is pretty basic &quot;Non-Designers Design&quot; Robin Williams stuff.

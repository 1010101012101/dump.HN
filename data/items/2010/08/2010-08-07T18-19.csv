1584064,comment,1583816,1583816,0,0,devonrt,,,"You've assumed that statically typed languages are somehow ""better"" than dynamically typed languages and then asked ""Why doesn't everyone use the better languages?"" Dynamically typed vs. statically typed is still an open question and is a lot more complicated than ""which is better?""<p>> And on the plus side, you get all the benefits of compiler type checking, better IDE support, and great refactoring support.<p>Since when? Compile time type checking is only a benefit if you're worried about type errors and in my experience the people that are most concerned with type errors are the proponents of statically typed languages. With respect to IDEs and refactoring support, my experience has been more along the lines of ""C# and Java have good IDEs and refactoring tools, everything else not so much."" I personally find Scala and Haskell's tool support to be far behind Python's, just for example. Also, Smalltalk has, arguably, far better tools available than any statically typed language (or any other language for that matter).<p>Nobody has proven that statically typed languages are better than dynamically typed ones, nor that applications built with them are less error pronen. I would argue that the amazingly widespread use of Ruby and Python and the average quality of projects written in those languages is evidence to the contrary.",1281207510

I like this site and I'm not even a foodie :)<p>this line ""Build the ingredients you hate functionality"" got me thinking...
I suppose a website about social cooking might work, where you get recipes recommended based on previous recipes you tried and liked.<p>If a person submits a few recipes he tried and liked you can start recommending recipes to him that other users who liked similar recipes liked.<p>It might even be possible to 'follow' cooks you like etc...

At the time, there was no strongly-typed language that it was feasible to use that offered as much leverage.

1584057,comment,1582219,1582519,0,0,ewjordan,,,"Your math is right, but there's more to the story here, specifically to understand why the switching argument is wrong - this is commonly misunderstood, and has more to do with the implied ""fairness"" of the putting-numbers-in-the-envelope process than the calculation of the odds afterwards.<p>The super quick version: the number drawing process <i>can't</i> be fair, and that makes those .5/.5 hi/low probabilities wrong in general.<p>The real impossibility is the idea that we can ""pick a random number"" such that all numbers are equally probable, with no constraints on the size of that number.  If this isn't intuitively obvious, then just try to normalize a uniform probability distribution over the positive real line, you'll see the problem.<p>In order to select the two amounts, the original problem statement implies that we need to randomly pick A (which we can take as the bigger envelope) in exactly such a way, so basically, the ""paradox"" is dead-on-arrival, because the true prior distribution that A was picked from <i>must</i> be different - for example, there might be an upper bound, say $100, in which case if we see that our envelope has any number over $50 on it, we are 100% sure that we hold the larger envelope.  Otherwise, without some bounds or tapering of the distribution, we can't normalize it, and we can't use it to draw numbers from, so we <i>have</i> no numbers in envelopes to even discuss.<p>tl;dr version: If you can write me an algorithm that ""randomly selects a number"" (let's even make it an integer to make it even simpler - of course I mean an Actual Integer, not those short bit sequences that we pretend are integers when we program), such that no integer is more likely to be chosen than any other, then I've got two envelopes that I'd like to show you. :)<p>On another note, the truly insane might notice that in the same way that we can formally sum series like 1+2+3+... = -1/12 (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1_%2B_2_%2B_3_%2B_4_%2B_%C2%B7%C2%B7%C2%B7"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1_%2B_2_%2B_3_%2B_4_%2B_%C2%B7%...</a>), and 1+1+1+... = -1/2 (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1_%2B_1_%2B_1_%2B_1_%2B_%C2%B7_%C2%B7_%C2%B7"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1_%2B_1_%2B_1_%2B_1_%2B_%C2%B7_...</a>), we might consider the probabilistic analogues of these formulas, and ""formally normalize"" a PDF that <i>is</i> uniform over the positive integers, with a constant probability of -2 for every integer (whatever that means).  Similar things <i>could</i> be tried over the real numbers, though it gets messier because the integral analogues of those formal sums tend to come out to zero (for instance, for any integer n, the integral of x^n from 0 to infinity, in a very specific sense, is zero - perhaps I'll do a layman's post on this phenomenon at some point, it's quite useful in some cases), so normalization doesn't really work out so well.<p>Of course, probabilities can't be negative under the usual rule set, so all of that would be pointless, wouldn't it? :)",1281207284

1584053,comment,1581696,1581696,0,0,jules,,,"> The dimension of the configuration space of the juggling pin is six: the minimum number of parameters that specify the position in space is three, and the minimum number of parameters that specify an orientation is also three.<p>Can somebody explain this? Isn't the number of parameters that specify an orientation two, totaling five?<p>Pick two atoms in the pin and specify the location of one atom. Now the other atom can only be located on a sphere around the first atom. The sphere is a 2d surface for which you need two parameters.<p>Another problem is that you can encode two real numbers into one, for example by interleaving digits. So you could specify the entire pin with one real number. What exactly is the problem here and how can you eliminate it? You need to impose more conditions than simply continuity, because you can make a continuous bijection [0,1] <-> [0,1]^2?<p>I really like the approach of this book. I often don't feel like I understand (or even know what there is to understand) something until I code a program for it. For example you understand collisions if you can write a program that given an initial configuration of polygons at t=0, gives the  configuration at later time. If you don't do this then you don't know exactly what you understand. Perhaps you understand collisions of point masses, but not general collisions.",1281207050

My interest is mainly in the resulting discussion that this department of subject matter might generate here.<p>One of the things about HN, sociologically, that gives it a distinctive flavour is that the people here are mostly technocrats, and, as such, very wont to believe that large-scale, systemic problems facing mankind (resource depletion, peak oil, economic decline, war, hunger, cancer, etc.) are genuinely solvable.  There's an inexorable kind of optimism coupled with studious attention to detail that one doesn't see from the more sensational and superficial discursive space surrounding these issues in the world at large.<p>As a Russian immigrant, I find that this idealistic tendency of Americans (distilled and concentrated here) is simultaneously their biggest asset and their principal liability. Americans are often given to pronouncements of childlike problem-solving optimism about things for which it is all but certifiable that there is no solution, or at any rate, things for which the notion of an identifiable, apprehensible, and discrete solution is not intelligible. Sometimes, it is as if they have an almost ontological inability to understand that not all problems can just be ""solved"" like that.  It leads to a lot of blind alleys, dark holes, and red herrings--in a word, boondoggles.<p>And yet, to the extent that human progress has triumphed a tremendous amount of obstacles in seemingly improbable ways, this attitude is very necessary to sustain it, psychologically.  It underlies much of the American Century
s revolutionary contributions to enhance the quality of life and the basis for hope in the world. In other words, if we are going to fix reality and make it better, this general disposition is utterly prerequisite, even if at times the formulations to which it gives rise are naive, simplistic and facile.<p>So, it is with that in mind that I read the comments here on such topics with enthusiasm.",1281206831

I have found that using Python has enabled me to learn some programming concepts that I struggled with in .Net.  .Net supported them just fine, but somehow the Python approach was intuitive for me, so once I learned it, I could abstract it to a different language.  Polymorphism being the primary example with Python.<p>More recently, I've gravitated toward languages that provide support with both dynamic types and static types (and arguably C# has heavily moved in that direction, but still I find the syntax not intuitive).  The hybrid is nice, as you can worry about the higher level algorithm more easily with the dynamic feature, and then shift over to static to take advantage of the features you cite for static.<p>Earlier this year, I discovered the Cobra language (<a href=""http://www.cobra-language.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cobra-language.com</a>), which boasts a python-like syntax on top of .Net (and supports both dynamic/static typing), and is optionally more strict than standard static typed languages in that it adds the benefits of contracts, nil-checking, and embedded unit tests.",1281204697

One thing that I bump into with nearly every program I write in C# or F# is that I want to add a method to a generic type when the type supports some method. Suppose you have a type Bag<T>. Now if T supports an interface IValue with method ComputeValue() I want to add a ComputeValue method to Bag<T> that computes the sum of the values of the things in the Bag. Of course the method would only be available when T supports IValue. This can be done in languages with more expressive type systems, but there are (provably) other perfectly valid programs that they will reject.<p>Another reason against statically typed languages is that the compilers are often slow.

Most of the night lookups have been shaky. Turns out it's a massive DDoS coming from China and taking out core routers at Tier 1 providers including Level3, GlobalCrossing, Tinet, Tata, and Deutsche Telekom.  Our DNS provider is seeing flooding of over 50 Gbps.<p>Providers Twitter account: http://twitter.com/dnsmadeeasy<p>Details from the support ticket:<p>There has been a massive DDOS attack against all of our systems starting about 6:00 AM EST.  Our networking team was immediately notified and have been working on resolution to the problem. Our full administrative team, as well as any available off duty technicians are being called in to assist with the situation and we hope to have it resolved ASAP. Unfortunately, our normal techniques used to fight this attack did not work properly. The bandwidth associated with this attack was able to bring down the Tier 1 provider core routers. The estimated size of the this attack is over 50Gbps and due to the nature and the negative affect it had on some of our Tier1 provider's backbones, we were unable to reroute traffic and contain the issue.  We are currently working on a resolution to this attack and getting everything back up as soon as possible.<p>This is the first time the DNS Made Easy name servers have been unable to answer queries in over 9 years of business. We will be evaluating the situation and determining what needs to occur to prevent this from happening in the future. As more information becomes available, we will be informing our client base though email and updates on our website.<p>---<p>I'd like to add that DNSMadeEasy provides awesome service and obviously this isn't something they could have avoided.

1583949,comment,1583816,1583816,0,0,sqrt17,,,"Seeing statically typed variants of Python such as ShedSkin or PyPy's RPython, I think that one major annoyance is gone.<p>You still need polymorphism for some things, and having the possibility to have ""implicit interfaces"" (you just write x.foo() without declaring that x implements the foo interface, or that y and z also implement it - this is also useful when y or z are library classes you cannot change).<p>Often, the type inference that is needed slows down the compile times quite a bit; and (both with Haskell and with C++) you get incomprehensible error messages when something is wrong but it could have gone wrong in half a dozen places. (C++: 6 lines with ""in ..."", then ""no such method: foo"", Haskell: expected type bla->foo->Z x, found a->B c->d)<p>IMO, static type analysis on top of a dynamic language (e.g. PyDev) gives you most of the benefits of IDE and refactoring support - with the additional coolness that it can just skip the places that are not type-able. (Optional type declarations to put PyDev back on track in the most obvious
cases would be great, though).",1281204317

It's analogous to physical index cards held in folders, with the advantage of everything being searchable and in one place.<p>There's a keyboard shortcut for almost everything and we use SSL for all traffic to and from the service. We also have an ""RESTful"" API.<p>Currently Atombox costs $5.00 after a 30 day trial.<p>There are many rough edges, especially on the landing page.

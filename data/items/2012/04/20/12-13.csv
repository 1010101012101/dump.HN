If you are going to be second, you have to bring something really great to the table, something that itself has value, and replaces the value of the thing you are leaving. To use an example: Sean Parker said Facebook should never have won, considering MySpace's network effect at its height. Facebook was great: it had its own value, but it still had to replace MySpace's massive network effect. Luckily, due to MySpace's lack of innovation at that time, its own value plummeted, making it easier for Facebook to rise up above it.<p>That's what I would say. Being first is good, because you can capture the market, hence making it difficult for users to switch.",1334926619

You take Option A and Option B and see which one achieves more Goal C.<p>But you can't just look at the percent difference and decide that Option B must be better! Look, it has a higher percent Goal C! But that could be due to chance, so A/B tests employ tests of statistical significance to determine whether the test results are _probably_ chance or _probably_ reflect a genuine causal increase in Goal C.<p>For example, if you flip a coin four times, and get heads three of those times, without a statistical significance test you might conclude heads is 3x as likely to appear as tails. We know that's wrong, though- each side on a coin has a 50% chance of appearing face-up for each flip.<p>The flaw in this experiment is that we tried to extrapolate a result from a very small set of data. A statistical significance test would take these results and say ""we have a <very small percent> confidence level that heads is more likely to come up, and doesn't just come up more often by chance"".<p>If we flipped the coin 10,000 times instead, you'd get something pretty close to 50% heads and 50% tails, and your significance test would return a high confidence level that those numbers are accurate.<p>Short story long, you need lots of datapoints to determine whether an A/B test result is chance or an actual difference, and the smaller the difference between how Option A and Option B perform, the more datapoints you need to be confident they're actually different. Patrick's numbers are so close together that he'd need far more than 300 sales to reach the gold-standard 95% confidence level that there's actually a difference.",1334925580

For example Mossad paying revolutionary groups to kill off Iranian scientists, the release fo the documents would lead to condemnation of Mossad and stilfe their activities, thus saving some innocent scientists from being assasinated, sure Iran may want to retaliate but the other option is you allow Mossad to go on killing iranians (or anyone else they choose to) without bringing scrutiny on their actions.<p>Your example was extreme but it was poorly thought out. If the information is powerful enough to cause a nation to want to launch a nuclear weapon at another country then that sort of information needs to be publicised, whatever the hell it is that is bad enough to start a nuclear war is certainly not going to get any better by hiding it away from people.",1334925566

Take a look at <a href=""https://github.com/justincormack/ljsyscall"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/justincormack/ljsyscall</a> which binds the syscalls.<p>The annoyance that I'd thought of is that the array indexing starts with one, not zero - this brings some headaches during the index calculations. But this also forces to rethink the logic to use more of iterators, and abstract away from the indices. So, after all, it is not that big of a deal.",1334923835

In fact, they didn't implement the language at all: to the best of my knowledge they haven't even written a Java compiler.<p>All they did was write a translation tool that takes Java binaries and makes them run on a different VM, not covered by the Java license. Unlike others who implement languages to provide technical benefits, Google had no such intention. Their only consideration when choosing to re-implement a piece of Java or not was whether it would allow them to evade Java's legal restrictions.<p>My stake in this is that as a Java/other-JVM-languages developer, I don't like the fact that we now have two incompatible Javas. Now, Google explain their actions by saying that Sun were dragging their feet during negotiations, and maybe they're right. Maybe, thanks to Google we have an almost-Java thingy on a successful mobile platform.<p>I think the parties should settle, and I hope the result (whether money changes hands or not) would be bringing Android in the Java fold, and making it compatible.",1334923771

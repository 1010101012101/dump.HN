2532490,comment,2532271,2532271,35,0,jxcole,,,"I appreciate that symbols can be an odd way to represent every day quantitative problems, but I have never had a problem with it. Sure, some people do, but this guy seems really royally pissed off at ordinary mathematics.<p>I have always been a proponent of having more than one way to teach a certain subject. Studies have shown that different people perceive and interact with information in very different ways. The current ""one size fits all methodology"" to teaching is lame, to say the least. So a new way of teaching people mathematics is welcome.<p>But that's not to say the old way didn't work for people like me. If this site kills math so that English majors can cope, I hope someday someone will kill poetry so that I can cope.",1305035972

The OS I don't backup at all since everything I need data-wise is on a corporate server.<p>For my personal stuff, I have a mixture of a large media library, and my wife's business files.  The entire system gets backed up nightly (via rsync) to a primary terabyte USB drive.  And then I back it up again to a different secondary terabyte USB drive.  The business files (her accounting data, website source code, etc.) are additionally backed up to an offsite cloud backup service.<p>Every year I buy a new terabyte drive and make it the new primary backup drive.  The old primary backup drive becomes the new secondary backup drive.  The old secondary backup drive gets DBAN'd and sold on ebay.  That way my primary backup drive hardware is never more than a year old, and secondary never more than 2.<p>My media library backups run the risk of a local disaster; fire, etc.  But I can afford to lose all that and just be sad about it, but no big financial loss.

The spatial intuition we evolved in the wild doesn't work well for a number of things, which is why symbols and abstraction are so useful in the first place.<p>We don't need mathematics to figure out how a swinging pendulum works; we can do that intuitively.  (Actually, this isn't completely true, but we can at least get the general idea.)  Simple problems like that are worked out in classes so that students can get used to the mathematics.  In domains where our intuition fails us - e.g. quantum mechanics, high-energy physics, statistical mechanics, not to mention 11+ dimensional formulations of string theory, infinite or fractional dimensional spaces, and more esoteric theoretical mathematics and physics - we rely on mathematical symbols and abstraction to guide us, because our finely honed physical intuition is useless (and sometimes worse than useless).<p>I'm interested in seeing what the author does with concepts like superposition and n-dimensional spaces.

Video chat isn't as convenient as voice chat, but when you want to take some time out to really talk to someone, it's the closest thing to face to face.<p>Also, I think video chat works better and will pretty much always work better on computer than on smartphones. There's a much better screen, you don't have to hold it just right, and it's easier to sit down and make time for a video chat on a computer. If you're looking at the numerous failed attempts at video chat on phones, I can see how you'd see it as useless, but Skype is different.",1305034735

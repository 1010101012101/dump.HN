The chance of you opening a public AP in a crowded place and getting back a Hacker News password is slim to none - I'm not saying it's safe though.<p>Foursquare passwords, on the other hand, is something you can very easily intercept in the open - due to the way it's used, and that it sends your passwords out every time you open it without you typing anything - that's already unusual. There're surely a lot more poorly secured sites and mobile apps, but something like Foursquare's authentication scheme is a big problem for its users.",1282431499

You're right, the BES is a ""global""/centralized project and cost, usually negotiated with an org-wide discount for devices.\nBut every Blackberry device for each individual employee is usually an as-it-comes decision, spread out over departments. And at that level, the Blackberry is very much in danger.<p>Why?<p>* Within months of Apple announcing iphone Exchange compatibility years ago, it was enabled at every corporation that I know of. (It only takes one VIP with an iphone to make IT jump to make it happen. It's not just an iphone thing, it happens all the time with all sorts of edge/marginal technologies.)<p>* As for non-VIPs: even Blackberry companies have a cell phone purchase program for non Blackberry devices. This usually involves a preferred carrier and device set (that has a company-wide discount). But it also includes an ""exception"" program where companies will reimburse part of the cost of whatever device an employee chooses. These programs were not invented for smartphones, but just simple phones. But they sure are being used for smartphones at this point.<p>* Newest: What I'm seeing on the ground is this: Due to tighter budget scrutiny, fewer and fewer corp-bought devices (of any brand) in general, and employees not even bothering with any employer stuff at the purchase level. And then seeking partial reimbursement for their bill.  It's less and less common for the employee-chosen device to be a Blackberry.<p>This is part of a larger movement of the consumerization of business technology.  And employee phones is a part of the larger BYOPC movement.

So this isn't ""having to brute force RSA or AES"" level security, just making it slightly harder.<p>Still, it could be relevant:<p>It's not quite clear to me what Foursquare's business model is, but if location owners are handing over cash in return for checkins (i.e. new customers or increased repeat business) either indirectly or directly, then as such a customer of Foursquare you'd probably want the system to be less easily gamed - which is the reason I was surprised.<p>EDIT: the comment by a Foursquare employee blows that theory out of the water - the locations aren't paying them as far as I can tell, and are providing incentives for users on their own accord.",1282429159

Are you saying that friends meet up at locations not because they set it up via email or Facebook or Twitter beforehand, but because they were in a location randomly and saw a friend in a nearby location?  What if they weren't invited?<p>I don't think you really understand how Foursquare is actually used.",1282428870

The latter you could even do with gmail until they defaulted to SSL.<p>If you were using, say, Hacker News on a public wifi without going through a VPN or so, I could trivially log in as you just by looking at the Cookie: headers you send to it. I don't need your password to post as you and I probably could even change it because HN doesn't ask for your old password, but maybe it requires email confirmation in which case you just need to notice.

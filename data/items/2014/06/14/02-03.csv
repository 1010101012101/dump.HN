Honesty and plain language for these types of releases is generally only appreciated when there is an ability to work in a self-deprecating angle, or cast the message into the form of a reasonable request for forgiveness (which is, essentially, asking people a favor).  eg:<p>&quot;Sorry, we fucked up by doing this, that and the other thing.  We will try not to fuck up again.  Please bear with us.&quot;<p>People like that.<p>&quot;We&#x27;re taking away access to something you might use and like because we don&#x27;t make any money from it.&quot;<p>People don&#x27;t like that.  Since the nature of the message isn&#x27;t in-line with asking for forgiveness or asking for a favor (which people love, see: the Ben Franklin effect), the bluntness reads like &quot;Fuck you, because we can&quot;.",1402714733

7891946,comment,7891258,7891615,4,0,drewcrawford,,,"I don&#x27;t think you understand HomeKit, or Apple&#x27;s view of it.<p>What&#x27;s important to Apple is that you have a good user experience. As this applies to HomeKit, there are a few important requirements: battery life, and security/privacy. Keep in mind we are in the early days of home automation, and all it takes is one bad story about the hacker adjusting your thermostat to sour the market.<p>The only way to achieve those objectives is to exercise some control over hardware manufacturers. Sure, you may lose some compatibility this way, but that is infinitely preferable to a security risk in a poorly-understood environment without good security hygiene traditions. As a software developer who works with Bluetooth hardware, the Apple MFI certification process is the only hardware cert for home automation I am aware of. So even if I was an Android dev, I would prefer to purchase hardware that went through MFI as it gives me a basic level of confidence that somebody signed off on this.<p>Secondly HK explicitly includes measures for compatibility, including a type of &quot;bridge device&quot; that can translate between HK and a manufacturer&#x27;s proprietary (or open, as the case may be) format.<p>Thirdly you have to consider HK&#x27;s target audience. One of the headline features inside the HK Apis is the support for multiple homes. The people who are early adopters of HK in the near future are not hackers sharing an apartment. It&#x27;s the Tim Cooks of the world where throwing out the existing automation hardware is not of any concern.<p>Sure, at some point it will become ubiquitous, and as the market matures news stories about the dangerous thermostat hackers will be less of a concern. But that&#x27;s not this release, and it may not be within the next five years. That&#x27;s more than enough time to create HK bridges and poly lingual lightbulbs that speak multiple APIs and so on.",1402714716

Especially true for MacBooks.<p>Not true at all for iPhones which are available on very affordable plans in all developed countries, and are ubiquitous, even for users who are nowhere near middle class.<p>Microsoft is in transition. The idiocy that was Windows 8 all-but killed the Wintel desktop PC market. The server side is healthy, but desktop Windows is looking very shaky indeed.<p>For better or worse, Jobs deliberately moved Apple out of Enterprise. We can argue about why, and we can argue whether or not it was a good decision. But Apple decided to focus on consumer computing - which strengthened the consumer brand and freed up development resources, if nothing else.<p>MS is still trying to slide into all kinds of niches. It&#x27;s succeeding in a few, but failing and flailing in many.<p>Nadella will likely be more focused than spaghetti-at-the-wall Ballmer, so we&#x27;ll have to see how that works out.<p>Azure isn&#x27;t solid enough as a cloud service yet - too many outages. Server is looking good. Office is kind of old and boring now, but still does what it does.<p>So what can MS offer modern startups that they can&#x27;t get better and/or cheaper elsewhere?",1402714312

Apple has the right ideas about pushing in this direction - as for me I&#x27;ve essentially given up on trying to keep everything both synched and available for any use case.  The main thing Apple&#x27;s fall updates won&#x27;t offer that I&#x27;d really like is multi-user for iPads.

Sometimes the &quot;update&quot; button shows up before the update is actually available (and the app store redownloads the same version), sometimes the update is available in search results before the app information page, some times the update push notification comes first, not to mention replication geographically and across the different country stores. It&#x27;s first an hour after your update is released that the app store is consistent. It&#x27;s pretty tolerable now, but it used to be way worse and would take up to 10 hours - we&#x27;d get complaints from users due to all the failed updates when the store was inconsistent. We still get complaints on new app releases for random &quot;this product is not available&quot; errors for the first couple hours.",1402712875

If I don&#x27;t look at a property and press the back button it takes me out of search altogether where I would expect it to take me to the pre-filtered search.<p>2. On the search results page, the stars confuse me.  I don&#x27;t know what they represent.<p>3. It would be nice to be able to see hotels that score below 60 (perhaps as a filter option).  Budget conscious shoppers might find they are lacking options otherwise in certain cities.  Sometimes you&#x27;re just looking for the best of the cheapest, even if it&#x27;s not a 60+ hotel.<p>4. From the blog page, I think the TripExpert logo should take you to the main TripExpert home page, not the TripExpert blog home page.  I see the Visit TripExpert link but considering that is (probably) the primary action you&#x27;re probably hoping for, I think it shouldn&#x27;t be hidden in the nav like that.<p>5. I was also initially confused when I added a filter and the search results didn&#x27;t automatically update.  I think that&#x27;s become such a standard UX that you might want to adopt it too.<p>Overall though, this is really impressive.  Great job.  I think you have a wonderfully bright future ahead of you.<p>EDIT: Added 4th suggestion<p>EDIT 2: Added 5th suggestion",1402711275

We judge if they are harmed or not by the result, and the result of this method of treatment if correctly followed is decidedly good. So it&#x27;s not true that temporal pain is implicitly indicative of harm.<p>The people who are in power in the US right now do not represent the real will of the people and thus they do not have the people&#x27;s mandate. As such, no matter whether the EU withdraws from a trade deal with the current US government, it is not withdrawing from a government which is of the real people. As such, it would in fact be right of the EU to withdraw its agreement with the current US government so that more truth about the degree of legitimacy of the current US government is revealed. It&#x27;s only by admitting the truth that we can finally start to go on the right path. To continue the way things are going now, where these dire problems are hidden, is even more painful to truthful people than it is to have the truth come out. Because the truth always exists.<p>I hope this helps things make more sense to you.",1372730268

It&#x27;s teachers eating separately from students, no time for recess, and no adult to talk to without social ostracism.<p>Then I went to a New England Prep school; 3 sports a year, teachers eat with and openly question students, everyone feels like members of the community and people have a stake in things, and the Headmaster knows everyone&#x27;s name. I can&#x27;t thank that school enough; I went from failing with almost perfect test scores to really good grades and a sense of belonging.<p>I don&#x27;t understand why at least rural schools can&#x27;t follow the same model. The teachers are paid less but get better results; the students are cared for and more disciplined, and the academics and athletics are generally better.

He was a leader that the division really rallied behind, and Xbox had its first profitable year under him. I&#x27;m excited to see what he can do with Zynga. I do find the transition a bit ironic due to his history at EA and EA&#x27;s newly formed rivalry with Zynga.<p>I strongly believe that Bach was forced out after the incidents with Courier and the Kin.

Most men won&#x27;t feel intimidated or fear for their safety just by the unwanted presence of a woman, so it may be difficult for some to empathize with the opposite of this experience. Add on to this that, as humans, we judge others for their actions, but ourselves for our intent. Many men are not going to physically hurt women, and commenters that empathize with the creeper come to assessment that since they wouldn&#x27;t hurt her, then she must have been over-reacting. (This fails to take into account that the woman in the situation doesn&#x27;t at all know what the man she is intimidated by is going to do or what kind of harm he could cause her.) Add the stereotype of the regular nerd culture participant as being socially awkward and thus unaware of many rules regarding social interaction, and it&#x27;s easy to paint a caricature of an unaware fool who was just misunderstood and is now being bullied for his awkwardness.<p>&quot;Most men fear getting laughed at or humiliated by a romantic prospect while most women fear rape and death.&quot; -Gavin de Becker",1372728156

We can harness the power of the electron to post, critique and posture ideas in nanoseconds because of <i>extremely</i> creative people. The &quot;boring&quot; stuff matters just as much as the &quot;non-boring&quot; stuff. What kills me is that the STEM and liberal arts side of the education debate are arguing from extremes - and both sides sound like morons when it comes to creativity. Creativity is harnessed by two things: a wealth of experience and knowledge (ie learning Calculus is good, just like skipping rocks on the river), and treating idea generation like play and not like work. Obviously it&#x27;s a little bit more nuanced than that, but that&#x27;s the distillation and the point remains. The boring stuff matters. The non-boring stuff matters.

The judiciary can think whatever it wants to, why does it matter? I&#x27;m only giving a <i>philosophical</i> opinion on the logical implications of the existence of various criminal statutes, and my opinion is that they have lots of rational-choice implications but zero moral implications. To put it another way, if everyone has a duty to refrain from X&#x27;ing, the importance of this duty is neither increased nor decreased by the existence (or lack thereof) of a law that punishes X&#x27;ers. I think I&#x27;ve offered plenty of philosophical arguments in this thread to try to back that up. But if you&#x27;re looking for legal opinion, you&#x27;re talking to the wrong guy.<p>I did mention &quot;hypothetical imperatives&quot; in my comment above. &quot;Conditional imperative&quot; was your terminology. You&#x27;re right that a conditional <i>sentence</i> may turn out to be a categorical imperative. But since according to Kant there exists only one categorical imperative with 3 different formulations, and since &quot;If your society has laws, obey them&quot; ain&#x27;t on the list, I&#x27;m going to assume that Kant doesn&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a categorical imperative.<p>If so, it&#x27;s just another hypothetical imperative whose validity depends on whether it is consistent with <i>the</i> categorical imperative. Kant apparently thinks it is, for unrelated reasons. That&#x27;s where I depart from Kant, because I don&#x27;t think the imperative in question is consistent with the categorical imperative. At the very least, it would have to be revised to something like &quot;If your society has laws that promote obedience to the categorical imperative and its logical consequences, follow them.&quot;",1372727227

I&#x27;m not defending this. I hate that it&#x27;s that way. It&#x27;s unfair to women (who have a ceiling placed above them) and unfair to low-status men (who are treated as garbage, criminals, effluent).<p>This rank-order exists because humans are not naturally monogamous. High-status men can have more reproductive yield than any woman (200+ children, easily) so there is more incentive to compete and, in pre-monogamous times, it was aggressive men who took the most risks and ended up on top (or dead). Low-status women outrank low-status men because they still have wombs (a scarce resource) while low-status men only have unwanted genetic material (and are a risk of upset to the high-status people).<p>Most &quot;creepers&quot; or &quot;sketchy guys&quot; are socially awkward, low-status men who get scapegoated for the horrible things done by a small minority of (high- and low-status) terrible men. Most are not guilty of anything other than being socially unwanted.<p>Society is so bad at finding and punishing the actual male criminals (who are still out there) that the hammer tends to fall on the socially awkward instead... because they&#x27;re not quick enough to get out of the way when it&#x27;s falling.<p>There&#x27;s a perfect storm for flamewarring on these issues because both genders have a genuine injustice to get angry about. For women, it&#x27;s the fact that most societies still are pretty horrible to them, that they are forced to compete in a career game that favors sociopathy (more commonly male), and that a small minority of very bad men still commits disgusting crimes (and sometimes gets away with them, especially when it&#x27;s high-status men involved; see: Stuebensville). For men, it&#x27;s the hypocritical nastiness (hypocritical because the most common offenders when it comes to, for example, rape are usually the entitled, arrogant high-status men) directed at low-status men. Note also that almost all men (probably 75%) will have low status at some point in their lives (especially risky times are the freshman year of college and the first 2-4 years in the work world).",1372727075

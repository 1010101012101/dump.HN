Who knows how much will be paid. 90%? 10%?<p>We're had around 15500 page views, not counting the buttons on third party sites like techcrunch for the first 2 days. I'll need to look at the logs for that.<p>Techcrunch earned around $70 per their post on tipjoy (so far), and that is raw conversion rate there. If more people had tipjoy accounts, the rate should be higher. Then again, people tipped to experiment and help our launch. Lots of factors here.<p>$70 per blog post isn't too bad at all, though they are a huge site.",1202888633

On Linux it's something else. There is no API in existence that lets you do anything outside of browser limitations.<p>JavaScript is only used to manipulate API of those controls, but not to implement controls themselves. This means that ""Office"" part of Google Docs is implemented by FireFox/IE/Safari, where google only provides storage for their output.<p>I blogged about this ""web apps nonsense"" a few days ago:\n<a href=""http://kontsevoy.blogspot.com/2008/02/web-vs-desktop-nonsense.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kontsevoy.blogspot.com/2008/02/web-vs-desktop-nonsens...</a>",1202887464

The answer is NO to both (90% of the time), but that doesn't mean I don't consume some of the content through other methods (I download it).<p>Meaning I won't just drop everything I'm doing on Thursday night to watch Lost, but I'll perhaps catch it on a Saturday afternoon when I have the time or feel like taking a break from my work.",1202887147

I haven't used a desktop word processor in the last year (unless I'm opening some file from a backup disk that I haven't had a chance to upload).<p>And wordpad was a pretty decent editor. The problem is it couldn't open word files sent by others (so I always had to install Office or convert files to RTF). Turns out most word documents render just fine in RTF.",1202886099

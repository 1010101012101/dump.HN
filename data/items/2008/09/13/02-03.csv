A sense of TRUE ownership.<p>I'm surprised that more people aren't making this point.<p>I think it's common among entrepreneurs to take ownership of some idea -- not in terms of stock or revenue, but more like parenthood -- and want to see it through to completion, on their terms, their way.",1221273984

I don't know all of the circumstances of their situation, but they might be able to set something up where jmagar will earnestly support and help launch his employee's startup, for a share of the action. While the startup's getting off the ground, the employee might be able to continue a few responsibilities at the company.<p>I know I would have jumped at a chance like that, mostly because I was scared witless of being without a regular paycheck.",1221273844

Whatever the quality of microsoft now it doesn't matter because I switched to Mac specifically because my computer crashed constantly , lost files, and gave me nightmares.  They need to get my friend telling me , "" Dude, I have been using Vista and I love it, "" end of story. I don't hear this anywhere. Is Vista that bad ? Probably not, but not bad isn't going to take back business from Apple, and change any previous negative perception that many people have of Microsoft products. A good Ad-campaign does little if you don't have substance behind it.",1221272911

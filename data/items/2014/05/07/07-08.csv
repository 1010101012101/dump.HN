7709075,comment,7708858,7708858,64,0,jcrites,,,"> Gillis Cashman, a managing partner at MC Partners in Boston, says it makes sense to charge extra to big content providers like Netflix, whose services at peak hours can sometimes consume more than 30 percent of total Internet traffic. Video is “significantly congesting these networks, and causing real issues for carriers where they have to spend a lot of money upgrading networks, and pushing fiber deeper into their networks,” he says. “There is currently no model for monetizing that required investment.”<p>This argument doesn&#x27;t make sense to me. The ISP&#x27;s customers are using the ISP&#x27;s network by downloading Internet content. The nature of the content should be irrelevant to the discussion. The ISP&#x27;s customers are purely responsible for that usage, and it is part of - from what I understand - the service they are already paying for. The ISP&#x27;s network is only &quot;congested&quot; if it is incapable of delivering on the service that was advertised (assuming for the sake of argument, some particular speed of access).<p>Thus, how can Cashman argue that &quot;there is no model for monetizing the required investment?&quot; Isn&#x27;t that exactly what ISP customers are buying when they pay for access to the Internet through the ISP? The onus should morally be on the ISP to make a good-faith attempt to build sufficient connections to any content that&#x27;s popular enough to saturate the links providing it.<p>Furthermore, why isn&#x27;t it naturally the ISP&#x27;s responsibility to price their access sufficient to cover current usage and expected growth in usage? New use-cases for the Internet are constantly going to appear. It is the ISP&#x27;s responsibility to provide Internet access with sufficient throughput that it is not congested for any reasons under the ISP&#x27;s control; and to price their access sufficient for investment to achieve the throughput.<p>&quot;The latest BigMac hamburger caused hungry residents to swarm McDonalds and caused drive-through lines to be congested today in Cloudville. Gillis Cashman, managing partner at McPartners, Inc. says that, despite selling happy meals in record numbers, delays in drive-through lines will continue, since since there is &quot;currently no model for McDonalds to monetize the required investment&quot; to upgrade its drive-throughs.",1399449455

7709073,comment,7708437,7708437,34,0,byuu,,,"Thanks to a curious Google search four days ago, I just found the obituary for my father, who died after a long battle with cancer ... three years ago. Didn&#x27;t specify which kind.<p>I never really knew him: all added up, I spent maybe two or three weeks of time with him. Almost all of which were from me calling him and asking if I could visit. So many times he&#x27;d say he had plans or just not show up. I just got tired of always reaching out to him, so I decided I&#x27;d leave it to him if he wanted to reach out back. Haven&#x27;t seen him or spoken to him in fifteen years. Maybe I should have kept trying, but at some point you just take the hint that you&#x27;re not cared about.<p>I never thought I would be saddened by his eventual death, and indeed, no tears were shed. But when I stop and think about it, there&#x27;s this ... feeling like your stomach is being dropped. You can logically consider the finality of death, but it really is quite different when it&#x27;s actually real. Just knowing that now, you can never, ever change things.<p>He didn&#x27;t die of a heart attack or in a car accident: he clearly knew he was going to die for some time. As callous as that man was to me, I never thought he&#x27;d be so selfish as to not reach out in his last days. If not for his sake, then at least for mine, for a chance to say goodbye. Perhaps I can kid myself and say he was too ashamed, but I know deep down that he just didn&#x27;t care.<p>There was always this hope that one day he&#x27;d feel some inkling of regret and we could reconcile, at least as much as one could with a father who wasn&#x27;t there. But now that he&#x27;s dead, there&#x27;s no longer any sliver of chance. He will now always be a selfish man.<p>I find myself angry that I am angry about his passing. It makes me feel awful that I can&#x27;t even grieve at the loss of a parent like a normal human being would.<p>But maybe this is better than the pain the author of this story went through: watching someone you truly love deteriorate and pass right before your eyes.",1399449396

You factor in insurance, employee salaries, utilities, leasing of office space, purchasing office equipment and computers, storage, maintenance (network and building). A registrar is like any other business, it has to factor in its overheads into the cost of their products.

Ever.<p>No. He said there were no plans for generics, which has been the story for some time. The official FAQ still states [0]:<p>> Generics may well be added at some point. We don&#x27;t feel an urgency for them, although we understand some programmers do.<p>> Generics are convenient but they come at a cost in complexity in the type system and run-time. We haven&#x27;t yet found a design that gives value proportionate to the complexity, although we continue to think about it. Meanwhile, Go&#x27;s built-in maps and slices, plus the ability to use the empty interface to construct containers (with explicit unboxing) mean in many cases it is possible to write code that does what generics would enable, if less smoothly.<p>It is my understanding that what Mr. Pike means by there being no plans for generic is in relation to the sentence<p>> We haven&#x27;t yet found a design that gives value proportionate to the complexity, although we continue to think about it.<p>[0] <a href=""http://golang.org/doc/faq#generics"" rel=""nofollow"">http://golang.org/doc/faq#generics</a>",1399446134

It pulls shared responsibilities out of modules and leaves no doubt that those responsibilities were shared. It detects recurring concepts and gives them a representation, thereby increasing coupling.<p>The second force is to reduce access to private code: out of 100 lines of code in your module, how many actually need to access that private concept on line 42 ? If the answer is &quot;30&quot;, then what are those other 70 lines doing in this module ?<p>Apply both forces to a code base, and the SRP will appear out of nowhere.",1399446049

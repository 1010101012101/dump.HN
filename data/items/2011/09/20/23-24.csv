Check out paragraph 113:<p><i>113. Beginning in or around August 2010, Full Tilt Poker was often unable to find payment processors to withdraw funds from the bank accounts of its United States players. Instead of disclosing this fact, Full Tilt Poker secretly began to credit funds to players online gambling accounts that Full Tilt Poker had never actually collected from players bank accounts. As players gambled, and lost, these phantom funds, Full Tilt Poker developed an undisclosed shortfall of approximately $130 million owed to players that Full Tilt Poker had never collected because, in reality, these funds were never withdrawn from players bank accounts. The management of Full Tilt Poker, including the FTP Insider Defendants, operated Full Tilt Poker with the hope that only a small number of players would try to withdraw funds at any one time, and that Full Tilt Poker would regularly receive additional deposits in amounts greater than any withdrawal requests.</i>",1316562880

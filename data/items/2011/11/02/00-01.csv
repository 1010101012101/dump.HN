I mention it just to show I've thought a lot about this problem.<p>What's interesting is that we all know something like this <i>needs</i> to happen for the PHP community, but the community isn't stepping up and rallying around one. Maybe being sucked into the Symfony world will help it get traction, but I am not sure, only because history has not been on the side of progress of this issue in the PHP community.<p>PEARFarm hasn't caught on too much (though we use it extensively in-house).<p>Composer works almost identically to <a href=""http://pearhub.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pearhub.org</a>, and didn't catch on, either.<p>Beyond that, there have been more (see phark, etc).=<p>As for feedback on your idea, my concerns are:\n1) Support for legacy PEAR packages doesn't seem to exist. There is a lot of code out there that people already depend on.\n2) PHP 5.3 only, while it is the future, still knocks down the addressable market to maybe 1/4 of the PHP world.\n3) Does your packaging system support installation of executables?\n4) Is there a bundler-style solution? I need to be able to easily install all dependencies in a sandbox. Committing an enormous vendor/ dir is an absurd practice.\n5) Does Composer allow the package to not include all files in the git repo?<p>That said, I would <i>love</i> for there to be a standard, widely-used, useful, easy & practical way to manifest dependencies and install them into a sandbox. I waste way too much time managing this on my own.",1320193850

(If you need comments, you've probably written your code in an obtuse way).<p>I started a new project a few weeks ago and went to the other extreme to see what it was like. I think I have more comments than code:<p><a href=""https://github.com/josephg/node-browserchannel/blob/master/lib/server.coffee"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/josephg/node-browserchannel/blob/master/l...</a><p>Rendered with docco:\n<a href=""http://josephg.github.com/node-browserchannel/docs/server.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://josephg.github.com/node-browserchannel/docs/server.ht...</a><p>The comments in this file also describe the spec of what I'm implementing and give running commentary on the implemention. It took me awhile to get used to writing like this, but I really like the result. When I want to add a function or something I talk about what I want to achieve in a comment block before writing the code.<p>Somehow, the whole feeling of programming is different. By making the documentation the highest priority, I feel like I'm writing rather than coding. (I hate writing generally, but I really enjoyed it here.)<p>I'm not sure if it helps or hinders readability. Obviously there's way more information in there about my intensions. You can tell if surprising behaviour in the code is intended or if its a bug. But the code has become really long and you have to scroll heaps to be able to move through the file. I feel like my monitor has shrunk. Maybe I just need to split the code out into more files.<p>I'm not sure if I want to program like this all the time; but I'm writing a lot more inline documentation now. When you get stuck trying to decide how to implement something, talking about the design choices in a block comment has the same effect as explaining the problem to a coworker. Only this way you don't bother your coworkers and you have documentation on the choice when you're done.<p>Its also a fun experiment because of how weird it feels - I highly recommend giving it a go sometime.",1320193694

If I could ask the woman to wear more considerate clothing at work, I would. That really bothers me.</i><p>I will add that no <i>man</i> would show up at the office in a muscle shirt, with his shoulders, upper arms, upper back, etc on display.  And I've known men who complained about having to wear a shirt and tie -- felt like they were choking.  In that regard, women have way more leeway in how they can dress and it is a completely sexist thing.  My general rule of thumb:  If no man would put it on display at the office, then I shouldn't either.*  Unbuttoned/low-cut shirts displaying a man's chest are also considered sexy. This is not limited to women's bodies.  But men generally show up at work covered up to the neck -- and would be sent home to change if they did not.  The tank tops and the like that I am entitled to wear are off limits for the men at work.<p>* I do wear conservative v-necks. Much to my annoyance, many of the shirts I would like to wear I worry would get me sent home for being too t-shirt-like.

Just to avoid a few sigils?  \n* Why build scipy when R had been released just before?  \n* Why didn't they just support matlab/octave? (scipy and matlab are so close in syntax anyway)\n* If syntactical differences are not enough to justify a new scientific library, why not just stick to Fortran, or C/C++?  One can argue that an enormous amount of time has been wasted on writing python wrappers.  For what?  Just to save a few keystrokes?\nHowever, most would agree that the world is a much better place now that scipy and related tools are in it.<p>Some arguments:\n* Ruby is expressive and flexible in ways that python is not.  For example, Rubyvis is flexible enough (or similar enough to javascript at least) to essentially accept protovis (javascript) code directly.  I don't think python can do this.\n* Ruby uses blocks/enumerators instead of 'for' loops.  How much programming involves enumeration of one kind or another?\n* len(array) vs. array.length<p>Coding is not just getting the computer to do what you want, it is also how you think about it and the form that it takes.  'len(array)' vs. 'array.length'  may not matter to most, but it matters to some of us.<p>The great news is that we can still use scipy when we need to.  I'm betting there is room for both projects, especially considering how small sciruby is at the moment.<p>Ocaml and clojure are great, but have a steeper learning curve; getting non-programming scientists to contribute is far easier in a language like ruby or python.<p>A beginning-programmer scientist who wants to start writing code to solve problems currently has to 1) code in python or 2) learn ruby <i>and</i> python/scipy or matlab or R in order to do some scientific computing.  SciRuby means (eventually) that for <i>most</i> things, novices only have to learn ruby.  It is hard to overstate the importance to new programmers of being able to use just one language (at least to start with).<p>If you like python over ruby, this is easy.  If you like ruby over python, it gets old piping all your data over to a python script to use the basic features of scipy.",1320193229

Where does this guy work?<p><i>Apparently, one of the girls’ boyfriends at the theatre had made a remark about another girl’s makeup in the group.  He thought she looked - hot.  Oh boy.</i><p>Why else wear makeup?<p><i>The [boys'] ride home was filled with laughter, profanity, burps, flatulence and a few head slaps.</i><p>I've been on trips with high school girls where all of this happened, plus some really inappropriate ""truth-or-dare"" questions. Anyway, what part of that is sexist?<p><i>Words, thoughts and important points are missed because of a new perfume or a low cut blouse.</i><p>Trust me, if I could turn that off, I would. If I could ask the woman to wear more considerate clothing at work, I would. That really bothers me.<p><i>Men don’t have this kind of instinctual tug.  Let’s face it:  unless there’s beer involved, men don’t have many instincts at all.</i><p>Complete bullshit. Remember this from a few days ago? <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3149170"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3149170</a> ""And by God, he was right. I wouldn't just throw myself under a bus for my baby, I'd happily throw my wife under that bus too - without the slightest hesitation."" No instincts, my ass.<p><i>We figure our wives will ultimately handle these things.  And in many cases, they just do.</i><p>That's not instincts, you idiot. It took years of training and a large support network for your wife to learn how to ""take care of things"" like that.<p><i>Men can sprinkle profanity in their conversation and it endears them as one of the folks.</i><p>The guys I know who swear at work tend to be more circumspect around women. But I never noticed any particular backlash against women swearing.<p><i>Men can date women thirty years younger and get high fives from their peers.  As much as many women would like to do that they just won’t.</i><p>Those men are asses. Sure we might laugh about it, but they're still asses. And it contradicts your own next paragraph:<p><i>we joke about the woman teacher that had a one-nighter with the high school football player.  And then we’re enraged by the male teacher who did the same thing with one of his female students.</i><p>Both teachers are in the wrong and should be trusted not to take advantage of students.<p><i>[Women] could never comment on the looks of a fellow co-worker.</i><p>?????",1320192521

The real thing I think ggplot and protovis/d3 share, and the fundamental thing that makes them powerful and interesting, is the declarative nature of those DSLs.

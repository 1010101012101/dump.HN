I haven't been invited... at least, not yet. :) <p>I spend 99% of my time coding. I like YC because it lets me focus on what I'm good at now, and then coaches me through the business aspects of delivering a product later. The details holding me back from doing this on my own are exactly what YC offers mentoring through.",1191214578

61487,comment,61333,61486,0,0,rms,,,"Yes, it looks fine if you have font smoothing on, but try turning it off. The underlying font rendering is really poor, the underlying font rendering for Windows makes everything look like a pixel font.",1191214057

61484,comment,61192,61192,0,0,icey,,,"I agree with this sentiment whole-heartedly. I'm an architect, and I consider it one of my primary responsibilities to build code on a regular basis. <p>My personal philosophy is that a practicing software architect must be an internal evangelist and illustrate why things ought to be done one way or the other. The <i>only</i> way to do that is by shutting up and showing some code. <p>When I was 'coming up' in this industry I was VERY fortunate to have excellent role models to show me how important it was for an architect to be able to explain in detail everything that they may recommend. Honestly, it makes me sad to see so many ""architects"" out there who make recommendations based on a few opinions that they've read about. In the real world, there are different solutions to different problems, and the only way to know what pegs go into what holes is to know what pegs and holes even exist for a specific problem-set. <p>Unfortunately, the 'architect' title is relatively new to a lot of organizations who find themselves lacking clear strategy, and a lot of those voids have been filled by people who clearly don't belong there. I hope that eventually that herd will thin out a little bit after enough companies have been bit in the posterior by allowing someone with the incorrect credentials to make their important technology decisions for them.

Perhaps I was lucky to be raised in an environment that encouraged independent and unique approaches to business, but I know many women who aren't afraid to accept  risks in order to achieve their goals. I agree, you should go out and meet more women.    ",1191213325

The new-ish REST routing enhancements are great once you get your head around it. I also like the ideas behind the performance enhancements, though I haven't had a chance to really flex them yet.<p>Beware though, they ""yanked"" out a lot of common things from rails core, so if you are upgrading an existing app you may spend quite a bit of time getting things working again.",1191212122

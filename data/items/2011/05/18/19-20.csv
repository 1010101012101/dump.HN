Since a large portion of games are cross-platform between 360/PS3 and the PC, you just need a PC as good as one of those. I spent less than a $1000 (including monitor, kb, 1TB HD, etc) on a decent PC about 2.5 years ago, and it's still able to run most everything I run into on max settings. Until we see a new generation of consoles, or something like another Crysis, you really don't need to upgrade your PC for gaming.<p>Besides, some of us prefer keyboard/mouse and modding ability.",1305748769

The other part is putting those theories to the test and quantifying the results in meaningful way over time. Again and again. Without the again-and-again part, you only have theoretical knowledge. Theoretical knowledge is not a ""hard science"". Involving data does not make a hard science. Applying heuristics to the data does not make it a science. A computerized model does not make something science. The weather-man uses science when developing a forecast. The forecast is not a hard science.<p>Take minimum wage for example. This is a theory with supporters in both camps - some for, some against. Well, how can we ever measure if a minimum wage is having a positive influence? How can we continue in support of a theory with no supporting evidence? Pile on 500 more concurrent theories, and you have a cluster-fuck only Krugman could defend.",1305748008

They can detect planets by measuring the tiny wobble of stars caused by the gravity of revolving planets. So I was wondering how the hell they detect free-floating (orphan) planets. The article explains that they use gravitational microlensing, which is a pretty cool technique. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_microlensing"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_microlensing</a><p>From the article:<p><i>> A 5.9-foot (1.8-meter) telescope at Mount John University Observatory in New Zealand is used to regularly scan the copious stars at the center of our galaxy for gravitational microlensing events. These occur when something, such as a star or planet, passes in front of another, more distant star. The passing body's gravity warps the light of the background star, causing it to magnify and brighten. Heftier passing bodies, like massive stars, will warp the light of the background star to a greater extent, resulting in brightening events that can last weeks. Small planet-size bodies will cause less of a distortion, and brighten a star for only a few days or less.</i>",1305748007

I sent an email to the support team explaining that there was a previous account and that I was the new owner, and upon proving that the domain was now mine they deleted the old account and had me start anew.<p>Obviously, while the email-support method is safe, the automated system for unlocking admin access based on ""proof of ownership"" is pretty scary! Seems like this could be solved by requiring you to prove ownership and then releasing new auth info to a linked email account on a different domain. That helps to establish both present ownership and a chain of ownership back to the last time you had authorized access and were able to adjust the ""emergency email account"" setting. It's not perfect, but it's a heck of a lot better.<p>It also seems to me like someone wanting to abuse this right now could do so pretty easily: you can confirm that a domain is available and that it has had a google Apps account set up in the past before you spend a dime, so you can just set a computer to trawling known Google Apps domain names (e.g., by looking at traffic on large mailing lists) to find ones whose registration has expired.",1305747944

Early (1 month) to allow purchase order & client holidays + potentially clients wanting to let a domain lapse. The system could then do another whois lookup expiry check before sending out the 1 week left reminder.<p>I take your point about the monthly subscription model. Thinking of the monthly services I pay for I tend to log in pretty regularly. As you say Flaregun isn't really like this. You would dump your domains into it when you first sign up, then login every so often to add a new domain (10-30 seconds). So payment options are:<p>1. Keep it monthly and perhaps reduce price.<p>2. Charge a one off fee (local program) - it could even be some kind of spreadsheet addon. However I favour a webapp as it is the easiest incarnation to iterate and further develop. Also a local program would need to always be running to display / send the notifications.<p>3. Yearly subscription. Domains are yearly so this would kind of tie in. Getting into a customers head if you thought Flaregun solved a problem for you, you probably would be fairly loyal - i.e. it's not a try it, see if I like and if I get on with it I will keep it kind of product. You either want it or you don't. But I always feel an upfront yearly cost increases the barrier to subscription. I wonder if a yearly cost with a 100% money back guarantee if not satisfied, could be the answer.<p>Any other thoughts / ideas appreciated.<p>Cheers,",1305747588

C is the lingua-franca of programming: advanced algorithms are often implemented in C (or in C like languages), other language concepts are often expressed in terms of C language concepts. ""Gold standards"" of systems programming are the C POSIX API and BSD sockets (best books on network programming use C for all of their examples). Learning UNIX and the GNU tool chain is also important.<p>Learning a non-imperative languages is also vital: most importantly Lisp such as Scheme and a strictly and statically typed functional language with type inference like Haskell or ML.<p>As for Ruby vs. Python, it's an implementation detail. The languages are close enough as if you know one, you can learn the other when you need to (at a new job, or when there's an open source project you'd like to contribute to). Make sure to be fluent in one, however, as ""scripting"" is a vital skill (especially if you have to deal with a production environment or build/release tooling).<p>Same principle as Ruby vs. Python also goes for Java vs. C#.

This effectively means that they need a global broadcast to the majority of nodes for every bit coin transfer.<p>This doesn't scale in terms of number of nodes, and it doesn't scale in number of transactions. They can not compensate for an increase in the number of transactions by adding more nodes because instead of distributing the work load over the nodes, they are in fact replicating it.<p>The rationale seems to be that as long as you have more honest nodes than malicious ones the system will not be hijacked. Of course, the chance that a Russian botnet has more CPU power than you do is quite real. They go on to say that if an attacker has more computational power than everyone else they would do better to use it mining coins than to break the system, and they seem to leave it at that. Counting on the rational behavior of potential attackers does not seem like a good strategy to me.<p>Maybe I'm missing something here, but I'm pretty sure this thing will simply not scale. It reminds me of Gnutella, which implemented search through scoped flooding and somehow promised both scalability and coverage. I have the same feeling here.

It is so helpful to get such thoughtful feedback and has really got me thinking critically about this product.<p>Out of interest do you develop websites on behalf on your clients or is it just web/email hosting?<p>I am trying to figure out the core market for Flaregun. I think it is really targeted at web design agencies which handle a clients complete web presence.<p>The last company I worked at, a small web agency, was a reseller (Enom) and like you would buy domains on behalf of clients. However a lot of our clients wanted to buy the domains themselves so they had full ownership. So we had a situation where we owned and renewed 70 odd domains and then the rest (100+) were owned by 40 odd clients (some legacy) across as many registrars. Tracking all these domains was just not possible. Some were bound to slip.<p>""i tell them they're responsible for renewing them (which i use as a selling point for why they should transfer them to me)"" - this is a completely reasonable policy which completely covers you. However perhaps this ""I told you so"" attitude wouldn't work in all situations. I guess it depends on the relationship with the client. If it is just hosting then yeah you can take that stance. However clients paid my old company to handle their web presence, sometimes on high traffic websites were downtime was not acceptable. In this instance their expectation was a little higher, and preventing potential problems like this was assumed to be a responsibility of the web agency.<p>Your thoughts on the free vs paid for plans are interesting. A few of my thoughts:<p>1. Perhaps it would make sense to get rid of the corporate plan (as you say anyone with this many domains would already have a well sorted billing / renewal system in place)<p>2. Make the agency plan unlimited (chances are they wouldn't have more than 500 est domains).<p>3. I see the professional account as a freelancer. Maybe 30 domains is too high in this case.<p>4. The free account could be removed and a 30 day free trial added to the paid accounts. I guess you either want this or not. The free account doesn't really serve as a sales device like it would on other apps. Also your use of Flaregun doesn't expand over time (like it does with a app like Basecamp). You start with x number of domains to manage, so you jump in at a price point (plan) which allows that number of domains.<p>I have been thinking about building billing (domain and hosting) into the product, but I guess most people already have an invoicing system setup and wouldn't want another systems. Integration with existing systems would be great but is time consuming and makes the web app a lot more complex.<p>Cheers,",1305746616

I admit predisposition to liking Termkit because I also had a similar idea in the past and I had neither the time nor talent to go anywhere with it. Kudos to this guy for producing something that looks like a very large step in the direction of improved usability and a potential step towards improved performance if programs can be made to pass each other common structures without needing to serialize and reparse the data until it needs to be seen by a user.<p>In addition to the frontend and pipe changes, I also imagined changing the way files are accessed. Some subsystem could put indexes and attributes on certain data files so you could run something like:<p>$ query --tsv login, uid, name[last='Smith'] < /etc/passwd > mysmiths.tsv<p>or:<p>$ cat /etc/passwd[@uid=0]@login<p>and you would get the desired set of information without needing to write potentially buggy regex scripts. If there was a new type of file that you wanted to get data from in a few different ways, you could write only one buggy regex script to use as a filter and then query the file with the shell's normal query methods to pull down any information you might need. In the example of pulling users from a file, the shell could know from the attribute metadata that you are looking at a list of users and it could show the results as widgets that you could right-click to get the user's properties.<p>This all implies rewriting every utility in the system to accept recordsets instead of text, adding custom code for every different targeted data file, and making sure it all works with existing tools that have not been converted yet.

2561270,story,,,2,2,anonymousMan,"When should someone be considered a co-founder?",,"I'm in a bit of an argument about what my title should in a start-up I am involved in (that's why I had to ask this question anonymously).  Here's the situation:\nA biz dev guy with pretty good experience and an excellent graphics/UI designer came to me with an idea to develop something.  I didn't love the idea but I liked the space and the team so we talked for a while about what we would actually build.  What we are building is significantly different from the idea they came to me with and they had no previous development, just a great flash demo.  They have spent some money on lawyer fees, branding, and a couple contractors but it probably only totals ~$10k and some of it is friends/family money as convertible debt.  I do significant work on the actual product strategy and UX, not just development, as well as a good bit of market research.  Basically anything that a founding member of a company would do just because he is passionate about the idea and wants the company to be super successful.  When I first joined, they wanted to consider me a product consultant and I was cool with that because I have never worked with them. Now we're about a month away from launching our first version of the app and I'm looking back on how significant and co-founder like things I have done.  I asked them to consider me a co-founder and they declined with this email:\n""we agreed that we really want to stick to a literal definition of a co-founder, which we would define as being one of the people who conceived of the initial idea for the business, made the initial investments of time and money, and recruited the team to execute the idea."" Of course there was a follow up conversation and more to come but that was the initial email I received.  On top of that they mentioned they didn't know me well enough but we have been working together for about 8 months.  While we don't know each other extremely well because we are all remote, they are taking a risk on me just like I am taking a risk on them by working for only equity, so that point seems invalid.<p>My question to YC is - Does it sound like I am a co-founder?  If so, how much should I care about getting this title?<p>In general titles don't matter too much to me but it really bothers me that it's such a big deal to them to give me this title when I feel I have clearly earned it.  I have spoke with successful entrepreneurs and they agree that I should be co-founder, but they are also my friends so I want a less biased opinion.",1305745246

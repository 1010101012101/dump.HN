1184557,comment,1183828,1184238,0,0,geebee,,,"I don't think it's the same question - the function of a PhD for science researchers is very different from the MD/residency for surgeons, which is actually very different from the function of a JD and the Bar for lawyers (lawyers don't go through anything like the apprenticeship a surgeon goes through to become licensed, and a PhD generally doesn't provide a license to do <i>anything</i>).<p>Also, keep in mind that many people believe that the Bar and AMA are actually large scale cartels that do more to harm the public than good.  This isn't necessarily an argument that credentials and licensing are bad per se, it's an argument that the scarcity of services causes more damage than the dilution of talent (for instance, nurse practitioners might be able to provide a very high level of service in areas where MD's currently enjoy a monopoly).  I'm one of the folks who are frustrated with the cartel-like behavior of professional associations in the US (and elsewhere), but there's obviously a wide range of opinions on the subject - some think they should be essentially abolished, others think they are fine in principle but need to be reigned in to ensure that ""protecting the public"" doesn't morph into ""protecting the cartel.""<p>It's controversial, of course.

1184551,comment,1183308,1184308,0,0,briansmith,,,"The specific bug you mentioned really was the result of writing/choosing a bad D-H library. But, I agree with your your point that, even if you have a security expert on board, you are likely to make mistakes.<p>If Tor would have used an off-then-shelf D-H implementation that already performed that check, it wouldn't have had the vulnerability. It is definitely easier to pick a TLS implementation that is unlikely to have such flaws (now)--just pick what lots of others have been using for a long time. You could do the same with crypto primitive implementations, but you run into problems because the interfaces for different libraries are all different, and in particular the preconditions and postconditions of various operations might be different. So, user of a crypto library has to fully understand all the details in order to verify what is his responsibility and what is the library's responsibility. It would be great if there was a specification that specified what every D-H implementation must do, and what the user of a D-H implementation must do to be safe.<p>Actually, a similar problem exists with TLS. Right now there is a draft TLS spec. that attempts to standardize how TLS implementations check a server's certificate against the server's domain name. Since there's no standard way of doing it, its harder to verify that a given TLS implementation is actually doing it the right way. And, actually, this is something that OpenSSL and other TLS implementations punt on and force the application to deal with manually. As I'm sure you've seen, lots of applications actually don't even check at all!",1268333718

It comes with extra baggage by default, such as all the cert parsing stuff and built-in root CAs. That's the root of Colin's ""what about China?"" complaint.<p>ZumoDrive sounds like a poor design. It uses a strong transport channel with extra baggage (certs, ASN1, many cipher suites) to move data to a server, where it is in plaintext form until it is encrypted by some unknown program that uses AES in some unknown mode. When I see a design like this, I say it doesn't ""hang together"" well. It has a number of links in a chain, and any failure compromises your data.<p>Colin's points are right on. Thomas is also right, but he's picking a different argument (that roll-your-own crypto would have been worse than SSL). But both of them also missed the point that ZumoDrive apparently roll-their-own in the server side component that encrypts the data before storing it. It's AES + mumble mode + key generated who knows how + no mention of integrity protection.<p>Following both Colin's client-based design and Thomas's insistence on off-the-shelf crypto would have been possible and straightforward. Generate a PGP key pair for each client, encrypt/sign the data with it, then upload it to the service.

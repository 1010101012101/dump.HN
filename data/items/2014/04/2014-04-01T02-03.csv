7505892,comment,7503829,7505767,4,0,meowface,,,"> I have yet to hear why bitcoin reflects a better choice than cards for the consumer.<p>I think security would be an obvious answer.<p>Credit cards are like symmetric cryptography: there&#x27;s only one secret (a number), which you must share with everyone you ever want to send or receive money from. Any malicious actor who gets that number can then use it to extract money from your card. Sure, it&#x27;s probably FDIC insured, but they still make out with some of your money.<p>With Bitcoin, you only ever share your public key. It operates entirely on public key crypto. You can safely share your Bitcoin account public key with anyone and everyone to send and receive funds. Plus, anyone can verify any time you send or receive a payment very quickly. That way you can&#x27;t lie and say you paid when you didn&#x27;t (no checks in the mail). You also can&#x27;t do chargebacks or otherwise recall your funds, like you can easily do to scam with credit cards or Paypal.",1396320935

7505834,comment,7504296,7504883,2,0,sockypuppy,,,"> what should we do <i>right now</i>?<p>This is a long answer, so here&#x27;s the TLDR:  All sides of the debate need to tone down the name-calling, demonization, boycotts, and ostracism of opponents.  Treat the other side of the debate like they&#x27;re intelligent and well-meaning, but somehow picked up some misinformed, misguided, or mistaken assumptions and doesn&#x27;t realize.  Try to figure out how to change people&#x27;s minds so they believe the right thing, instead of focusing on punishing people who believe the wrong thing.<p>I&#x27;m the rare HN&#x27;er on the opposite side of this cultural divide, so I thought my perspective would be informative.  A lot of people who read the previous sentence have probably already characterized me as either a poorly educated hick or a slavering, sadistic bigot.<p>The truth is, that by dehumanizing your opponent and assuming bad faith, you guarantee that people who don&#x27;t agree with you won&#x27;t listen to what you have to say.  This means you can&#x27;t really change minds.<p>If you want to further the cause of gay rights, figure out the reasons people disagree with you, and try to convince them otherwise.  Try to teach and explain; stay away from confrontation, condemnation and personal attacks.  If someone else (on either side) becomes indignant, keep calm and encourage them to do likewise.<p>For example, in a little bit I&#x27;ll give you a list of questions I&#x27;ve had about gay rights that no one&#x27;s ever answered to my satisfaction.  Based on past experience, I should give you a few warnings about my questions first.<p>You will probably think these questions are highly inflammatory, but I don&#x27;t intend them to be trolling or snarking; rather they&#x27;re things I&#x27;m honestly confused about.  You should try to remain calm and think logically while reading my questions.  This is apparently very hard for most pro-gay-rights people, for reasons I don&#x27;t really understand.<p>Opponents of gay rights say these questions have no good answers.  Instead of providing good answers, proponents of gay rights call anyone who asks these questions very bad names like &quot;hateful,&quot; &quot;offensive,&quot; &quot;bigot,&quot; or &quot;dinosaur,&quot; and don&#x27;t actually answer the questions.<p>I don&#x27;t know the answers to these questions because neither side ever actually answers them.  The only thing I have to go on is the behavior of the two groups.  Based on the above typical interaction of the two sides of the debate, I have to say the opponents of gay rights win:  The pro-gay-rights side&#x27;s only answer to skeptical questions is calling names.  I&#x27;d probably change my mind if the pro-gay-rights side offered good answers and the anti-gay-rights side were the ones who weren&#x27;t able to offer a coherent response.<p>Here are the questions:<p>What are the reasons you believe what you do?  What is the evidence that homosexuality is an in-born quality as opposed to a choice?  How strong is it?  What about concerns that gay people are promiscuous, spreading AIDS and other STD&#x27;s?  Is a gay household an unhealthy environment for children?  To what extent is homosexuality associated with crimes like rape and pedophilia?  Why is homosexuality traditionally considered morally wrong (e.g. Sodom and Gomorrah in the Bible), a symbol of decline (e.g. the late Roman Empire), and even outlawed?  If the millenia-old traditional viewpoint was wrong, why did it last so long?  Were the anti-gay-rights people always wrong, or has technology changed the picture (e.g. maybe STD&#x27;s are now less serious due to inventions like condoms and antibiotics)?<p>And one last question, which doesn&#x27;t really change how I lean on the question of how I feel about gay rights:  Why do so many pro-gay-rights people try to advance their agenda by calling names and boycotting organizations, instead of simply patiently explaining their side of the story?",1396320018

It was reasonable for them to clear bystanders away from the EMTs, but it was unreasonable for them to resort to physical force so quickly after encountering hesitation that a) posed no threat to the EMTs and b) could have been easily addressed without violence. I don&#x27;t think police SOP should be &quot;1) make demand, 2) attack civilian that hesitates due to objections with demand.&quot; Some situations allow time for rational conversation, this was one of them, and the police rejected that possibility (which had a lower likelihood of resulting in bodies flying into the EMT&#x27;s workspace) in favor of using force.<p>Sgt. Espinoza used Woosley&#x27;s passive insistence on getting his phone back, which explicitly did not interfere with the wellbeing of the patient or the actions of the EMTs, as a justification for employing violent compliance techniques. If Sgt E doubted W&#x27;s ability to get his phone back without interfering (not unreasonable), he should have volunteered to do it on W&#x27;s behalf rather than violently subduing him for what to me looks like entirely reasonable hesitation (reasonable in the moral sense, not in the maximize-probability-of-avoiding-arrest sense).<p>Partensky&#x27;s case is more difficult to assess without a video recording.

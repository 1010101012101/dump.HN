It is definitely do-able at speed though as <a href=""http://www.classycode.co.uk/CoverFlow/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.classycode.co.uk/CoverFlow/</a> does it fast - the only problem there is the interface (a ""wheel"" like mechanism).",1220237260

Ethics are at an all time low in the corporate world, and if some anonymous entity is going to lay you off, people wonder why they shouldn't gain a little ""payback"" value from it by stealing secrets? I'm not recommending people do this, but the motivation is obvious.",1220237138

Funnier, though, if once you've done it, you use any OpenID at your disposal to log in - it generates an empty account for you within their system.<p>Of course, this could actually work out well as only people with a smidgen of interest in using the site will bother to try it.",1220236969

Nokia has had Nokia Catalog installed on all its phones forever but it never made any money with it. Then, Apple builds the second coming of Nokia Catalog, names it the ""App Store,"" and starts raking in the cash.<p>Just because somebody else has done it, doesn't mean that it can't be done (again) more successfully.",1220236629

It's acceptable and you can get a job done with it as far as I can see.<p>The author hypothesises that people choose plain PHP over drupal because they are scared off by the many configuration options.

291654,comment,291373,291373,0,0,ckinnan,,,"""This conjunction of an immense military establishment and a large arms industry is new in the American experience. The total influence -- economic, political, even spiritual -- is felt in every city, every State house, every office of the Federal government. We recognize the imperative need for this development. Yet we must not fail to comprehend its grave implications. Our toil, resources and livelihood are all involved; so is the very structure of our society.<p>""In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist.<p>'We must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties or democratic processes. We should take nothing for granted. Only an alert and knowledgeable citizenry can compel the proper meshing of the huge industrial and military machinery of defense with our peaceful methods and goals, so that security and liberty may prosper together.

291653,comment,291399,291537,0,0,gscott,,,"If a person had been a contractor for some period of time I agree that is perfectly reasonable.<p>Myself I have never been a contractor and really do hate side projects of which I have taken a few and found myself tied to them far beyond what I could charge so I quickly got out of that.  I did make the mistake of mentioning I have done some web sites in the past directly on my own.  That is a job interview killer because employers do not want you to have any other responsibilities other then for the company, so even if you have done a few websites on the side in the past, just don't mention it.  It didn't help me to mention that, it was not a positive like I thought it was.  If you want to use that experience, say you did it not for someone else but to learn how to do ""x"" because it seemed interesting (might be modifying some cms, shopping carts, etc whatever) and there can't be any business reason, you just did it for fun and not for anyone else.<p>Even little things can be a job interview killer.  Right out of High School I decided I would get a simple job as a person who takes telephone sales at a company that sells cpu's and memory.  It was entry level with entry level pay.  I had relatively no experience so I mentioned I had helped  few people with there computers (innocently enough, not even as a business, just the 'hey you know computers help me with x' type thing).  The 3 women (I have no idea why it required 3 people but...) said that the company was going to go into computer repair and that they couldn't possibly hire me because I would take all of there business.  Then they started making jokes at my expense, I have to say I nearly cried.  I have never desired to be in the computer repair business myself<p>I have more stories like that, it gets really bad when you work on your startup for two years and then need to get a job.<p>I have some simple suggestions if a person is NOT applying at a startup or a web only business:<p>1. You didn't own the startup, working at the startup was a mistake you would never want to repeat.  You were told that there were paying clients and that it was cash flow positive.  They lied to you and you don't like being lied to.<p>Reason:  You might leave there employment for some startup opportunity or that you might be a free thinking human being and somehow impervious to instruction.  OR even worse you will compete with your new employer, your a mole out to steal there business.<p>2. You do not have any side projects, you have never taken any side work like a simple website project.  You would never think of doing such a thing! If you are married say your wife forbids it, then laugh and talk about how much trouble you would get into!<p>Reason:\nEmployers want your full attention, if they think you are going to make any money on the side then heck you might even start doing that work during work hours or there work is going to be less important.  None of that is true but people are plain stupid and you cannot afford to ""chance"" that the person might be a thinking human being.<p>I have more sage advice but this is already getting a bit long and I am pretty sure most of the people here live in areas where it is ok to have ""outside"" learning experiences.  Not where I live :)",1220234431

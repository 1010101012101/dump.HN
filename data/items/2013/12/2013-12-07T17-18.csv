6867020,comment,6866652,6866928,11,0,evanrich,,,"It seems to me that these articles are talking about different sorts of jobs. They are both quoting the same numbers, but choose to use different application for those numbers. I would think there is some truth in both sides. For Rowe&#x27;s part, he is talking about jobs that can not be outsourced and are not optional to those who need the work finished. Pipe fitting, maintenance through welding, and vague post-Katrina engineering jobs are jobs and skills that have to be done on site, and therefore can not be moved overseas. They also pay well. These are jobs that make up part of that 3.5M jobs number, but I would guess a small portion of it. The NYT article talks about machining and factory work. In this field, work can be done here or abroad, so the cost of workers is a commodity. Unless tax breaks help these factories bring higher wages or the owners are altruistic, in my mind we can count these jobs as already gone. Someone could take that job for a bit, making $10-15 an hour but as soon as the commodity cost of wages exceeds the cost of added transportation abroad or the cost of transportation falls or any number of little pieces that fall into the outsourcing equation change, those jobs are gone just like the rest. The issue with these jobs are that they are still considered skilled when technology is quickly making them unskilled.",1386439064

6866991,comment,6865205,6865464,0,0,mtdewcmu,,,"I posted that article to HN, but it didn&#x27;t get any votes. I know very little about Clojure, but I think the conservative/liberal dichotomy he describes is very real. Liberalism and conservativism in software are closely related to liberalism and conservativism in politics. The description of conservativism in that quote is not terribly insightful, because he&#x27;s obviously going out of his way not to offend anybody, so he made it excessively simple and superficial. To get a good handle on how conservativism manifests itself in software, ideally you&#x27;d need a subtle appreciation of how it manifests itself in politics; less in terms of dry theory and more in terms of the character traits and basic orientation toward life that precede adopting conservative views. Yegge speculates that someone could be a liberal in software and a conservative in politics or vice versa, but I kind of doubt this. If it does occur, it&#x27;s probably in borderline cases, or in cases where somebody may be truly a conservative deep down, say, but is not engaged enough in politics to have realized it yet, or they side with the left politically as a result of specific issues rather than temperament (e.g. the person is a racial minority).<p>You could say that conservatives, both in software and politics, tend to be sticklers for rules and structure. That may be enough to shed some light on the difference as a practical matter. But I think that doesn&#x27;t really get to the essence. Liberals can also be for rules and structure. What differs is the nature of the rules and who they apply to. I think it&#x27;s closer to the truth to say that conservatives generally distrust people. In politics this general distrust manifests as, e.g. opposition to social welfare programs, because of the belief that people will invariably take advantage and abuse them. In software, the distrust manifests as, e.g. opposing programming languages and language constructs that are too laid-back and give the programmer too much freedom. The belief is that programmers, in general, can&#x27;t be trusted to make good choices, and will invariably write bad code if they&#x27;re allowed to.",1386438405
6866990,comment,6865980,6866648,6,0,wheaties,,,"Actually in medicine we have both the good and bad of patents. For any drug to be brought to market in the U.S. there is, by necessity, a long and expensive process to ensure a drug does more benefit than harm. This process can cost millions of dollars but producing the formula + manufacturing is often not nearly as expensive. Hence, a patent, because of the legal framework for which these inventions are conceived within, granting a monopoly for a short period of time is the only thing that promotes or gives companys an incentive to continue on with FDA approval.<p>This, by the way, is no means or excuse for some of the shenanigans drug manufacturers take part in.

Details are missing on this vital element plus defenses against the Sybil attack are missing from this design.<p>Mechanisms such as the &quot;averageProofOfWorkNonceTrialsPerByte&quot; in this system only slow down attacks and do not stop them. Check the impossibility proof by Harvard to see that systems like Bitmessage which react to any message cannot build an effective Sybil defense: <a href=\"http://dash.harvard.edu/handle/1/4907301\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://dash.harvard.edu/handle/1/4907301</a>\nSo this is known as a hard unsolved problem.\nFurther diving into the scalability issue is this project thread on their forum:\n<a href=\"https://bitmessage.org/forum/index.php?PHPSESSID=8cl6qeafitkac363ufcqma3tp5&topic=3391.0\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://bitmessage.org/forum/index.php?PHPSESSID=8cl6qeafitk...</a>\nIt would be great if the partitioning concept and algorithms could be explained in detail.

TOR has over 50% Bittorrent traffic, it&#x27;s difficult to stop users from using(abusing?) TOR like that. Systems like Bittorrent and Bitcoin have some incentives, but Bitmessage with broadcasts and proof-of-work might even have a negative incentive for participation. I have seen no mechanism to prevent it&#x27;s users broadcasting Blueray rips. This would bring down the system, one cluster at a time.

Google will lead you to more information on each.<p>Standard feed forward deep net: like the ones you used at university but with a few important features.  One, you can stack layers on top of each other then train the whole network with back propagation.  The nonlinearity you use can be important (rectified nonlinear units--Max(0,x) are popular now).  Regularization can be important (with dropout being a popular method).  Pre-processing your data can also be important (eg scaling the inputs, subtracting the mean, ...).  How you initialize your weights is important.  Using tricks like momentum and learning rate decay are important too.<p>Autoencoder: A standard feed forward deep net that tries to output an &quot;uncorrupted&quot; sample of a &quot;corrupted&quot; input.  So basically, take an image, add noise, ask it to output the denoised image.  Why you ask?  Well, in doing this, the hidden units (the layers in between the input and output) tend to discover new features which can then be used elsewhere in machine learning pipelines.  The big win here is automated feature engineering.<p>RBM: Restricted boltzman machine, sort of like an autoencoder but not.  I&#x27;m not convinced one is better than the other, but there are definitely differences.<p>Recurrent neural networks: Like standard feed forward deep nets but extended to time series problems.  The hidden units at each timestep feed in as additional input to the next timestep (along with the new input).  So basically, each step it gets this as input: [whatever came before described as hidden units] + [input at T].  These are my personal favorite and currently hold state of the art in speech recognition, at least academically.<p>Convolutional neural networks: State of the art in vision, this one is kind of hard to explain quickly, but you can think of it kind of like this: I take some image where I want to recognize objects in it.  Then I train a bunch of neural nets that represent different aspects of an image (one net might look for vertical lines, another might look for horizontal. It figures out what it&#x27;s looking for automatically and distributes what it thinks are important across these little networks. You can think of this as &quot;feature detection&quot;)  You then take a window on the image (400x400 image, maybe you&#x27;ve got a 20x20 window) which you then slide across the image and check each section for the presence of whatever the net is looking for (vertical/horizontal lines, etc.)  There&#x27;s several layers of this (specifically a convolution operation followed by a pooling operation) before the result is fed to a standard fully connected feed forward net which then outputs a prediction.<p>While lower layers look for low level aspects of an image, each layer progressively looks for higher and higher level phenomena--for instance, when you hear about &quot;the cat neuron&quot; it comes from probing a neuron in the higher levels of a convolutional net and finding that pictures of cats happen to turn this neuron &quot;on&quot; while pictures of anything else don&#x27;t.  What is &quot;high level&quot; exactly?  In this case, it really just means composed from &quot;lower level&quot; components... Some also say &quot;higher level = more abstract&quot; but I don&#x27;t know this is quite the case--abstract means something different to me.<p>An important consideration is that the conv net architecture allows you to cut down on the total number of parameters (good when you&#x27;ve got something high dimensional like image data) and it also takes advantage of the fact that you can make certain assumptions about images and how objects move/appear in space basically.<p>Conv nets are probably the most difficult architecture to grasp and my explanation is extremely high level.<p>Ha, that was a bit longer than I had hoped, but I hope it&#x27;s helpful to someone...",1386437499

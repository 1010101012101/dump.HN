Repetition of busywork does not require a teacher, it only requires a textbook. The purpose of having a teacher in the loop is to ensure that students are actually understanding the material, which is why they are graded. If a student can get through a class without acquiring any degree of competency or basic understanding of fundamentals that&#x27;s a failure on the teacher&#x27;s part.<p>If &quot;teaching&quot; was just a matter of reading and completing exercises then we could replace teachers with scantron machines.

7084174,comment,7081346,7082582,4,0,Joeri,,,"I was lucky enough to have toured both the european space facilities, and kennedy space center. The difference is that the european space program is focused on the science and engineering first, self-promotion a distant second. The ESA facilities were not centralized (i spent a week living in a bus to see most of them), and they weren&#x27;t set up to handle tourists or journalists. The actual launches aren&#x27;t even done from europe, so while i did see a live rocket test and the assembly hall for the ariane 5, these are not things which you can buy tickets to, and most of what the average citizen could buy tickets to was just ... bland. By contrast, KSC is a showroom first, it&#x27;s set up to impress people, especially with things like the rocket garden, the vehicle assembly building, and what amounts to a theme park in the arrival area.<p>When you tally up the science and cost, both programs are probably very comparable, but the US program is much more approachable, because of a strong self-promotion mindset and a complete lack of self-awareness. Loud and proud. The ESA programs are much more low key, what pride there is must be carefully weened from between people&#x27;s modesty.<p>I think the difference in the space programs is a reflection of the cultural difference caused by how the US was formed. The european culture has always valued knowing your place, and people who didn&#x27;t want to stay in that place moved to the US. The US as a consequence values people who try to shout from the rooftops and reach for the sky.",1390131850

Removing the hacks and going with straight up individual wavelength photon tracing without <i>any</i> hacks (other than using the adjoint formulation, which simply flips the direction of the particles) is where it&#x27;ll end up IMO.<p>The amount of data and computation needed is breathtaking, but it can be done today with a large cluster, Intel E5s, SSDs, Infiniband, and thousands and thousands of low end graphics cards to carry the math load. Individual scenes are in the 1.5 petabyte range using voxels, but there&#x27;s enough compute there to turn off the monte carlo hacks and just get the damn answer, every frame, like clockwork with extremely low latency, and with all geometric optics effects enabled.<p>The cluster hardware I spec&#x27;d to do the above clocked in around $2 million 12 months ago. I doubt it&#x27;s changed much since then, maybe dropped another 20-30%? That&#x27;s actually incredibly low—30 months ago, it was over $100 million (and physically impossible due to space requirements). When it dropped down to $16 million two years ago, I went after funding (and failed to raise it, thus ending a 10+ year journey).<p>Now it&#x27;s down to $2 million, but I&#x27;ve moved on to other work. I&#x27;m sure someone, someday will take up the torch and make it happen—maybe even these High Fidelity people.

If GoDaddy stops providing a service it has committed to, they have to pay back customers. Plain and simple.

Then you quit and the project is just barely getting off the ground. You worked 80h/wk so far, so you have this chance to double your productivity. In fact, that&#x27;s exactly why you quit, so it&#x27;s damn sure that you keep working the 80h schedule. And then it becomes progressively hard to go back to the normal working hours, because it implies slacking.<p>So it&#x27;s not a matter of <i>believing</i> in 80-hour engineering weeks and it&#x27;s not a matter of choice for many people.

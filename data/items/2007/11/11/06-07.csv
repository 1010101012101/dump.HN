Because willpower is a depletable resource, it is also necessary that the reader does not expend too much willpower resisting the impulse to spend too much time reading and commenting.  When the ""get back to work"" page comes up, I find that I have to expend real willpower not to click on the override link (anchor) at the bottom of the page.  To balance that change, you might simultaneously put a link to the reader's user page, so if he really needs to, he can go to his user page and turn the procrastination preventer off.  (A logout link on the ""get back to work page'd be nice too.)",1194762926

78343,comment,78329,78329,0,0,gibsonf1,,,"Very nice approach to your office.  One note though - in the last picture I noticed a smiling Xobniite with three monitors with his back to the window.  I've found that the ideal is to face the windows for a couple reasons.  The first one is that the glare from the windows on the monitor can be very annoying .  Secondly, in having the back of the monitor along the window wall, and the user facing the windows, you can then look up and out the window when you're thinking about something.  This helps you avoid destroying your eyes by exercising alternate focal lengths and for me, at least, it seems to help with creativity.<p>(I also found my office through Craig's List - $1 per sf believe it or not! :)",1194760979

If you want an broad idea of many different fields of mathematics and the history behind them, presented in a well-written and relatively elementary style, this is the book for you. However, the problem with being relatively elementary is that most of the articles merely skim the surface of whatever subject they are describing.<p>If you want to actually be able to solve problems using math (the fun part, for most amateur mathematicians), a textbook would be a better bet. If you stopped math at business calculus and want a great introduction to the calculus that mathematicians use, I wholeheartedly recommend Michael Spivak's <i>Calculus</i> as a next step.",1230166580

Then I just kept on coming across situations where it's\nreally useful (mainly when defining macros, but elsewhere as well).<p>Rectangle commands on the other hand I've not managed to internalize\nyet, I know they exist and I see they must be very useful.  But\nwhenever I come accross something that possibly could use them I end\nup using something else.",1230166579

Anyone fancy actually doing this?<p>I find I usually need to use a new feature a few times before it sinks\nin, this can be hard when it's not something I need very often.  A\ngame like thingy where I could try out the feature a few times (maybe\ncompleting a timed task or something) would maybe help that a lot, and\ncould be fun too (for the weird definition of fun that applies to\npeople who like learning new Emacs commands)!<p>I'd probably be up for participating in a project to create a set of\nthese games, anyone else?<p>I'll check back on replies to this comment after Christmas, then maybe\nput up a project page.",1230166218

What's my favorite way to figure out how to do some random arcane thing in emacs?<p>Google.<p>It's often pleasantly surprised that some task I thought was esoteric is actually solved in the standard emacs libs, but the fact that I had to go to Google to find it doesn't say great things about the editor's discoverability.  IMO, Emacs is about as discoverable as a dynamic programming language with a decent interactive interpreter such as ipython or irb.<p>I'm not saying it's the wrong tradeoff -- but if you want to learn Emacs you probably should read a book or two and ideally spend some time with a master.  You really can't just bring it up and figure out that M-q will conveniently re-wrap the current paragraph or that M-^ joins the current line to the previous line and removes intermediate whitespace.",1230163651

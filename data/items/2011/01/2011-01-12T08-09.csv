- Problem: Tagging and up-/downvoting mechanisms as used almost everywhere suck because they're too primitive!
- Solution: Do not just count how often s/o tagged s/th as ""funny"" or upvoted s/th, but save that info including user ID. If user A looks for funny links, tags from user B (who's ""funny"" tags are highly correlated with A's) carry more weight than tags from user C (who prefers a different kind of humor).
- Result: A <i>useful</i> tagging/voting mechanism that won't drag everything down to the average, but is able to identify and sustain multiple parallel ""subcultures"" with different preferences in the user base! Might help to safe HN, too...",1294822797

2095498,comment,2095008,2095444,0,0,roel_v,,,"Sorry but that doesn't make sense. When you buy from a supplier, you are already bound by a number of contractual stipulations, (almost) nobody reads those, either. They're still enforceable, there are mountains of jurisprudence on that. Should contracts be void because one of the parties can't be bothered to check the content of the agreement? Or should suppliers force users to read the contract to be enforceable? Some software makes you scroll down before you can click 'agree'; is this not enough? Should it show you the dialog for a certain amount of time? Or maybe software shouldn't be sold online, you'd always have to go to a store, where a clerk forces you to read and then quizzes you on the content before selling you the software?<p>You say the contract is 'unethical'; I understand that position and in some cases agree, to an extent. But do you agree with me that even if it's unethical, the principle is still sound and that the contract should be both enforceable and enforced?",1294822719

2095494,comment,2091804,2093766,0,0,aneth,,,"You are largely correct about Ruby I think, although it's broader than that.  Functional programming is popular because mutable data is a major cause of bugs, is hard to debug, and creates unnecessary complication.  In Ruby, all data INCLUDING the executable code itself, is mutable and regularly mutated.  Integration and extension, including throughout the Rails codebase, is accomplished by changing object prototypes.  This means that you can never rely on an object behaving in a certain way or following a certain code path, and your code or any third party code can easily be broken by a single line of rouge code from a library - and yes this happens often.<p>Regarding Scala, I don't think type inference means that you stop thinking about types, particularly when writing in a functional style where the returned value is the only thing that matters.",1294822518

It had been on my reading list for too long, and I'm glad I eventually managed to read it. Much more enjoyable that I expected it to be, even given the fact that much of the material is well-known already. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictably_Irrational"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictably_Irrational</a><p>- <i>Longitude</i> follows John Harrison's fascinating, painful and lengthy quest to win the Longitude Prize by creating a clock that was accurate enough to determine longitude at sea. Dava Sobel is a great writer and makes this topic totally engaging (aside: Sobel started her writing career as a technical writer at IBM). <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitude_(book)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitude_(book)</a><p>- <i>Bad Science</i> is Ben Goldacre's essential and extensive criticism of the media's health care reportage and of various health-related issues (vaccinations, placebos, etc.). <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Science_(book)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Science_(book)</a><p>- <i>Sum</i> has had a fair bit of press over the last few months. It's a collection of forty stories on the afterlife, by David Eagleman. It's a novel exercise in philosophy, and I thoroughly enjoyed five or six of the stories. It's a very creative and original book (and short, too) and is a good lesson in constrained thinking.<p>- <i>The PayPal Wars</i> is the story of PayPal's early years from the viewpoint of former PayPal marketing executive, Eric Jackson. I found it a riveting read on the trials and tribulations of a startup in a difficult market. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_PayPal_Wars"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_PayPal_Wars</a><p>- <i>Made to Stick</i> is interesting in many ways (such as marketing, psychology and rhetoric, to name a few) and is extremely well-written. Chip and Dan Heath really know their subject and explain how to make ideas or concepts memorable in this captivating book. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Made_to_Stick"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Made_to_Stick</a> Tip: Read the extensive excerpts on the official website — <a href=""http://www.madetostick.com/excerpts/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.madetostick.com/excerpts/</a> — and, if you enjoy them, read the full book.<p>- <i>Lolita</i> is one of those books everyone knows about, even if they haven't read it. I decided to sit down with this beast of a book and am glad I did. It's a great story and will really get your moral cogs ticking over. As well as that, Nabokov has an amazing way with the English language, and from very near the beginning I become a lifelong fan of his style. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lolita"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lolita</a>",1294819842

I also knew a few people in college who started there and are now getting CS Ph.Ds.<p>Curiously, it seems to be mostly women who are good devs and yet didn't start until college.  I'm not really sure what to make of that.  Could be selection bias - since boys are encouraged to play with computers, most of the ones who will be any good at it started in grade school, while since girls have no such encouragement, even ones that are good at it may never have discovered that until college.  Or it could be that all boys who are good at computers let it take over their life, and girls have many competing interests.  Or it could that only girls have the discipline to become good at something without it becoming their life.",1294819808

2095417,comment,2093315,2095362,0,0,MWarneford,,,"There's a beautiful coffee table book ""The Pixar Story"" that talks about the cash Jobs put into Pixar.<p>The book claims Jobs purchased Pixar for $5M and immediately invested another $5M. When he purchased the company he was also running NeXT. Pixar, like NeXT, was a computer company selling computer hardware. Both companies we're struggling and taking up a lot of Job's cash.<p>The story goes that Pixar started to produce more 3D animated shorts, these impressed Katzenberg at Disney who agreed to part fund Toy Story. Only to even get to that point, 6 years after Jobs purchased the company, he'd had to invest a total of $60M into Pixar. He was investing close to $1M a month.<p>Between Pixar and NeXT jobs was nearly broke. Although I suspect his ""nearly broke"" is a much bigger bank account thank my ""nearly broke"".<p>Not sure how true the story is. But that's how ""The Pixar Story"" tells it.",1294819764

Different companies, different projects, different markets, or different customers.<p>There's this model of the world we're taught as schoolkids - at least where I grew up - where you work hard at something, do as your told, and slowly but surely you rise up.  And maybe at one level it's true, but it's <i>very</i> slow, and you'll never become the sort of success you read about in the paper that way.<p>Instead, I've found that what usually happens is that you join an organization because you meet some minimum skill baseline that they're looking for.  And then as you practice and learn from the people around you, you end up picking up a bunch of other skills and getting better at your job.  But the people around you generally won't notice.  First impressions usually pigeonhole you into a general category, and then people are blind to gradual changes.<p>So to reap the rewards of everything you've learned, you have to expose yourself to new people.  Jump ship, and suddenly you seem really valuable to them, because all those skills you've picked up which your current organization takes for granted are new and useful.<p>There's a leverage effect as well: people try to work with others of roughly the same level.  If you're diligent about practicing, you'll go from being (hopefully) near the bottom of your team to the top of it.  If you then repeat the process, your new teammates better be higher skilled still, and so your team as a whole can tackle more ambitious problems.",1294819441

3702761,comment,3700277,3700277,74,0,michaelochurch,,,"To understand why Google isn't what it used to be, one has to understand what happened in 2009-2011. This is the era when Google decided to get ""real managers"" and they hired a bunch of executives from places like Oracle, IBM, and Intel. If Google had told them to wipe their fucking feet off before tracking shitty culture into the place, it might have survived. It didn't.<p>Google has an immense amount of talent ""under its roof"". Unfortunately, there's a necrotic layer of useless and counterproductive middle management coming up with a series of ""innovations"" that each have made the company worse. For a few examples:<p>* 20% time is dead. It requires managerial approval. More on that later.<p>* Until recently, people were hired ""between levels"" on the engineering ladder (which is generally a disaster at Google; see this: <a href=""http://piaw.blogspot.com/2010/04/promotion-systems.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://piaw.blogspot.com/2010/04/promotion-systems.html</a>) and then about 2/3 of them were ""downslotted"" to a lower level. It didn't affect their pay, but it blocked future raises, was a career kiss-of-death, and generally shat all over morale. What's amazing to me is that no one ever said, before this bit of syphilitic idiocy could reach implementation, ""This is a terrible idea and you need to stop abusing cough syrup on the job."" Fucking California culture, man. In New York, terrible ideas cause buildings to fall down kill people and so we refuse to tolerate them. Unfortunately, Google's executives seemed to lack the insight to recognize an obviously horrible idea as horrible. (Downslotting was abolished last year, but I'm astonished that such idiocy got in the door in the first place.)<p>* Engineers (not just managers) literally drop everything for 1-2 weeks each year to write ""Perf"" (for themselves and peers). The high-stakes performance review process is just that important.<p>* Google is resistant to any change that might improve engineer productivity beyond the rather plodding rate it has now. C++ and Java are the real house languages; Scala's not even on the table. Python is listed as a house language so Google can still hire people but it's rarely used and nearly deprecated in production.<p>* Managers have free rein to fuck over an employee in Perf if they believe him to be ""distracted"" or at risk of future distraction by 20% time, even if that employee's performance is otherwise strong. This doesn't make Google any worse or any different from more traditionally managed companies. It does deprive them of the right to market 20% time as a perk without being called out as liars.<p>* Last summer, it was announced that every employee had to have a 3-word ""mission statement"" that managers could change, and a 63-word quarterly summaries of their work. This was the infamous ""7/20"" all-hands in which the deprecation of 20%-time was announced.<p>* HR ignores severe ethical lapses by influential managers, including a person who was outright proven to be using low performance scores and PIPs (Performance Improvement Plans, which stop transfers) to block transfers.<p>To make it clear, Google still has some really great people and could turn itself around if it just fired most of the middle layers. The company still has an incredible number of immensely talented engineers of whom I think quite highly, but the company is so horribly managed that I see nothing but a cold, miserable twilight in its future.",1331726390

This is a gamble, but it's the most essential one of every entertainment industry: a few huge hits that subsidize tons of losers.""</i><p>If this figure is accurate, then it represents a far better hit rate than what the US movie and TV industries usually achieve. (The rule of thumb in the US entertainment industry is that less than 25% of TV pilots makes it to the airwaves, and of those, a very small percentage last a full season; an even smaller percentage of those last more than a full season; a fraction of those, still, last enough seasons to become financially successful. I can't recall the film industry hit rate off the top of my head, but I believe the going theory is that 4 in 5 films will fail, and the remaining 1 must subsidize those failures).<p>In fact, I think the US entertainment businesses will need to learn a lot from the anime business. As distribution techology becomes more sophisticated, we're going to enter a world where two things happen: 1) opinion leaders within a certain genre (superfans, otaku, loyalists, diehards...whatever we want to call them) will discover new content via collaborative filtering as seen on Netflix, iTunes via the Genius algo, etc.; and 2) those folks will, in turn, share their discoveries with linkminded friends via social networks. These distribution patterns will be less than kind to the mass-market, ""shotgun"" approach as it's been practiced by Hollywood firms for nearly a century. Conversely, they'll be much kinder to niche-portfolio production and marketing. To patio11's point, this will mean resources being devoted to product differentiation: basic stuff for the casual fans, and more limited-edition, souped-up stuff for the <i>otaku</i> (where the real money gets made). It'll also mean that entertainment firms will need to get <i>very</i> serious about high-involvement CRM with their otaku bases, as video game companies currently do. (To some extent, this has already been happening in recent years, i.e., with everyone in Hollywood's annually bending knee to the kingmakers at ComicCon).",1331725160

I think Michael Moore had a movie on this called ""The Big One"".<p>Forbes has an article on this, calling it ""The Dumbest Idea in the World"":<p><a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/stevedenning/2011/11/28/maximizing-shareholder-value-the-dumbest-idea-in-the-world/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.forbes.com/sites/stevedenning/2011/11/28/maximizi...</a><p>I read the biography on Goldman Sachs, and I don't doubt for one second that there was a historic culture that most of the employees were fiercely proud of.  But as the author mentioned, a few mistaken promotions into power and the whole culture of a company can change through death by a thousand cuts.  No doubt the same thing is happening at all large companies that started off with great roots.  I saw this occur at Yahoo, where completely idiotic decisions were made in order to preserve revenues so that managers' bonuses were left in tact.<p>Is this something that can be avoided?  I'm not sure... corporate culture starts at the top and works its way down.  It's something that must be demonstrated by the leaders of the company at every level, and it filters down to the lowest ranks.  So if you have a company with strong leadership, then I think it can be staved off for a while, but it requires a relentless focus.",1331725125

3702696,comment,3688198,3688799,1,0,cheatercheater,,,"OK, let's amuse your suggestion for a second:<p>1. I go to a shop, want to buy a cucumber, what I find is oddly shaped with bulges on it. Perfectly edible, but not that great for cooking and therefore I get less value. It is however sold as a cucumber; I am dissatisfied. I understand it might be a good idea to be able to sell those cucumbers; I do not trust your assertion that the cucumbers could not be sold legally - they probably could be sold at prices lower than usual. They could also be sold to companies that turn them into pulp or something like that; as animal food; etc. They just couldn't be sold as the Standard Cucumber Type #23.<p>2. Farmers are allowed to sell as much as they want. Some of them go for it and are able to sell the extra and end up making more money; others produce a lot of shit and end up not selling. I remember reading the news about road blocks set up by farmers dumping their grain onto highways. Yeah, nice thinking, Commisar Rafski.<p>Countries which do not have quotas end up with cheap butter. Why? Because the government ends up being forced to buy the surplus milk at standard price. Lots of farmers end up working on the assumption that as much milk as they produce is good, because it'll get bought at that specific minimal price no matter what quality it is. They could instead spend their time and resources making something that's needed, but no, they end up making volatile produce that'll decay in a week if it doesn't get turned to butter. And so, you end up having lots of butter. Again you are incentivizing completely pointless work. Really well intentioned, too. But short-sighted. Think twice the next time you compare the finance and economic prowess of the leading scholars in the whole European Union combined, with that of your farmer friend-of-a-friend who hasn't finished high school (that's the typical educational level of farmers in Poland).",1331724923

But now the important contribution is the money, not the decisions.<p>I imagine a conversation with Mozart went something like this:<p>""Mozart, I want a libretto.""<p>""What should be in it?""<p>""It should be about birds.""<p>""Okay, I'll get on it.""<p>The corresponding conversation in our world would be:<p>""Jack, I want a piece of software.""<p>""What should it do?""<p>""It should be like a blog but every post limited to 140 characters.""<p>""Okay, I'll get on it.""<p>It is Mozart and Jack who end up making 99% of the design decisions. What I'm saying that once the guy hiring the creator gets so involved that a good portion of the decisions are his/hers then that's a very inefficient way to compose a piece of music or a piece of software, and you're better off doing the composing yourself. Of course in many cases marketing is more important than the technical side, but this is no different. In a startup with just a couple of people the contribution comes from the guy doing the marketing, not a guy deciding the rough marketing strategy. In a big company the influence reverses because the business decisions have a lot of leverage simply because they affect what a large number of employees are going to do. Simply put, the question you're asking is ""Could twitter be done by me getting YC (and later VC) money and then hiring a programmer and a marketer?"". The right question is ""Why would the YC give the money to me instead of the programmer and the marketer?"". Note that a perfectly valid answer for a lot of startups could be ""I have connections and experience in the field"" (especially for e.g. medical or payments startups), but the answer needs to be <i>something</i>.",1331724430

The decline of past media industries does show a trend that looks similar to the changes occurring in the current games media industry. These changes are never destructive (despite what the affected platform holders will say), merely transformative. It also presents an interesting argument for entrepreneurs; could old media formats like Arcade or Movie Theatres be bought back with some disruptive change element, just as PCs have recovered some ground with digital content (steam) and free2play models.<p>I think it's hard to say ""Most game development is changing to mobile""; I think there's also a resurgence in PC gaming at the same time, but in a free2play/subscription model sense, without the restrictive policies of the console and mobile platform holders. With the launch of the PS Vita and the new technological advances on the horizon (A15, anyone?) I can definitely see mobile gaming and entertainment becoming a mainstay for most people. If gaming gatherings were as simple as bringing your phone/tablet/other misc. mobile device and meeting some people at a cafe or something to play together it would be a revolution. Imagine LAN parties with tablets + controllers or something. Self-contained portable gaming systems. This was sort of what I hoped the Vita would attempt; to make traditional gaming more social. To break down the physical barriers between gamers. But with the lacklustre games lineup and no real innovation in the platform, it appears mobile gaming is headed in a much more fruitful direction.",1331724244

3702648,comment,3700277,3701610,6,0,oblique63,,,"It's not necessarily always about 'choosing sides'. We are at the point where buying a product from one of these large companies no longer simply means ""buying a product"" (like you would produce at a Whole Foods). Popular tech products are so intertwined with their parent companies, that it basically implies more of a wager. As a user, when you make a purchase, you place a bet that in your commitment to use this product, the company behind it won't do something that will decrease the enjoyment/utility you get out of the product during its lifecycle. Now this doesn't have to be some new policy/action that literally occurred after your purchase, but rather something that was not obvious upon purchase, and might not even have to do directly with the product itself. Either way, this type of assessment still fits into what you're saying about evaluating a product on it's own merits, but at a certain point, the politics behind a product actually DO affect the product's merit, because they are so intertwined.<p>In my case for example, I just recently got bit by the fact that iPads are restricted to syncing with only one computer while I was developing an app for it. The iPad on its own is a fine piece of hardware, and is a generally nice product, but this one detail devalued it for me significantly. Can you honestly say this detail is completely detached from the fact that it is an apple product? I wouldn't think so, that move is completely expected from apple; it's part of the locked-down ecosystem you buy into with apple products.  I actually like apple's products 'on their own', because they are well made and have attention to detail; however, I will [most likely] never again buy one due to apple's aforementioned politics, which directly affect my experience with their products as a user. Similar thing happened with Samsung/T-mobile and my Vibrant which they never even updated Gingerbread; awesome product on its own, but the service I got with it (part of my 'experience') was poor, and totally determined by the politics behind it.<p>So while it might be easy to detangle product from company for something as simple as produce, it gets a bit trickier when looking to purchase a longer-term tech product. If you're ok with lock-down, and/or lack of updates, that's great, Apple and Samsung products are totally awesome, they're just not for me.",1331723749

I hope that the long-term life of Pivotal Tracker can be guaranteed.<p>I rely on Pivotal Tracker. I actually love using it, it's made programming a joy as it's made the chore of project management a useful and almost satisfying thing to do.<p>In recent years I've relied on other products from companies that, having been acquired, are either ""improved"" so that they no longer work for my purposes or shut down.<p>It gives me a nagging feeling that people aren't in this to produce great products for the long term. I really want to be proved wrong, especially with Pivotal Tracker, because after having used so many other tools for project management I cannot imagine having to go back to them.",1331723423

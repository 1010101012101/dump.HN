1026942,comment,1025755,1025961,0,0,gnosis,,,"If you look at the bug it's not a problem caused by using regular expressions as such, but rather by the choice of date  to be <i>""grossly in the future""</i> (ie. so far in to the future that it couldn't be a legitimate date at the time the software is running).<p>The regex was chosen to match 2010 to 2099, which it did just fine.<p>So problem wasn't in choosing to use regex's but in choosing 2010 as the date.  I'm sure that date was <i>""grossly in the future""</i> at some point (probably when the regex was first written), but obviously we are living in the future now and need the date to be moved forward.",1262418978

1026940,comment,1026296,1026296,0,0,anatoly,,,"I got myself a Sony Reader mid-2009 and started reading about twice more than I had been before. 2009 was also the first year in which I wasn't too lazy to document which books I read (I'm really glad I wasn't). Here're some of the favourites this year:<p>Classics:<p>Kafka's <i>The Process</i> and <i>America</i> - both stunning novels that deserve to be read as much as his most famous, <i>The Castle</i>.<p>Jan Potocki, <i>The Manuscript Found in Saragossa</i> - a trippy collection of tales organised in multiple nested frames.<p>Scott Fitzgerald, <i>The Great Gatsby</i>.<p>Leo Tolstoy, <i>Anna Karenina</i>. Still as breathtaking as I'd remembered it from the previous reading five years ago.<p>Science Fiction:<p>Gene Wolfe, <i>The Book of the New Sun</i>. Wolfe, whom I hadn't read before, turns out to be in a class of his own. It's literary SF, overwhelmingly masterful and beautiful in its prose and characters, yet it could give any hardcore SF novel a run in terms of its ideas. It demands and richly rewards a close reading. I'll be reading more Wolfe in 2010.<p>Ted Chiang, collected stories. Chiang writes only stories, and has written just a few of them, but nearly every one is a gem. Read <i>Understand</i> on the web (<a href=""http://www.infinityplus.co.uk/stories/under.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.infinityplus.co.uk/stories/under.htm</a>) to see if you like his style - I do.<p>Vernor Vinge, <i>A Deepness in the Sky</i>, <i>The Peace War</i>, <i>Marooned in Realtime</i>. All great novels, but start from <i>A Fire Upon the Deep</i> (I read that in 2008) if you haven't read Vinge before, it's the best introduction.<p>Greg Egan, <i>Diaspora</i>, <i>Quarantine</i>, <i>Distress</i>. Egan is the best hardcore SF author out there. _Diaspora_ is a fascinating take on shared simulated reality that's very different from the usual fare. <i>Quarantine</i> will appeal to your inner quantum mechanical geek.<p>Contemporary fiction:<p>Pynchon, <i>V</i>. Pynchon is the best novelist we've got. I recommend <i>The Crying of the Lot 49</i> as the best Pynchon to start from; <i>V</i> is more difficult and much longer, but rewards the patience. I still can't get over the fact that Pynchon wrote and published this novel when he was 26.<p>Orhan Pamuk, <i>The Black Book</i>.<p>Annie Proulx, <i>Fine Just The Way It Is</i>. A new collection of stories from the best writer about rural America out there. Three are extraordinary, two so-so, the rest very good.<p>Non-fiction:<p>W. Sidney Allen, <i>Vox Graeca</i> and <i>Vox Latina</i>. If you want to know how ancient Greek and Latin sounded, these are the books to read.<p>Elizabeth Lloyd. <i>The Case Of The Female Orgasm</i>. An interesting study into how available evolutionary explanations of female orgasm fail in various ways. This is a book about evolutionary biology and its methodological soundness as much as it is about explaining female orgasm.<p>Computer-related:<p>Peter Seibel, <i>Coders at Work</i>. A fantastic collection of interview with great programmers. The one 2009 book no hacker should be without.<p><i>Squeak by Example</i>. Does a great job of explaining Smalltalk in general and Squeak in particular.",1262418905
1026939,comment,1026421,1026763,0,0,walkon,,,"If the federal government was truly concerned about a ""concentration of power,"" then why isn't it concerned with  itself?  It is the most powerful entity on the planet, exercising coercion and destruction on a massive scale.  Taxing people's estates at death on money that's already been taxed is preposterous.  This is an example of the government using coercion to raise money for itself and nothing more.  This is the type power one should be concerned about.",1262418705

1026927,comment,1026615,1026690,0,0,drewcrawford,,,"I think this is worth highlighting specifically:<p>> By nature, most engineers try to tear projects down and explain why things won't work or are ""too much work."" It's often a consequence of how most of them can interpret minor hangups as major, nearly-insolvable problems. That's why you have to find those rare engineers, like Google engineers or Apple engineers, who have a respect for the arts and humanities. Those are the engineers who create breakthroughs and push the limits of existing technologies. NeXT, a computer company from the 1990's, was a very good example of this and its innovations are still being felt today. Its technologies underly the iPod, Mac OS X, and the iPhone. Its hardware manufacturing advances were far ahead of its time.<p>> If you are saying that this project is not feasible, you are simply incorrect. Non-specialist observers can see that the technology to accomplish this is available. We may not yet know how it's going to work specifically, but we'll find engineers and programmers who want to make it work.",1262417279

1026919,comment,1026421,1026826,0,0,anamax,,,"> As far as I understand it, the estate tax is meant as a counter to the idle rich. It's also only applied to very large amounts of money and, perhaps more relevantly, to the transfer of that wealth.<p>Since it doesn't do that, why would you think that it is intended to do so?<p>Yes, I know how it's promoted, but look at the reality.  The truely big estates aren't subject to estate tax and never will be.<p>As a general rule, when someone says ""this will affect the wealthy in a bad way"", they're either lying to you or completely clueless.",1262416989

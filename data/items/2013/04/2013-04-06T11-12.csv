My anecdotal data is that those other outcomes are much more common than acquisition offers. Yours appears to be the opposite. It might be due to the different kinds of businesses.

A report I heard on National Public Radio included comments by companies that distribute the more recent pesticides that those can be reformulated to reduce risk to bees, which seems like a sensible thing to do. What was happening to plants and especially food crops before those pesticides (and, for that matter, before <i>Apis mellifera</i> bees existed in North America) would be well worth considering carefully before deciding what pattern of regulation to follow.

If no female engineers, no video.<p>- Trim people based on their color skin. For added humor, tell the people I remove from our friendly video that ""at least they won't have to take a train"" or something related to racist treatments through history. Because after all, the only reason I am removing them based on their skin color is to fight racism.<p>- We can't have nice things. And we can't mock people either. If an actor is mocked in a video, make sure to blur him completely in post-processing to avoid any of this actor's features to be recognized: earrings? hair? skin? five fingers? Be serious people, we can't mock an actor with five fingers on each hand, think of the stereotypes involved!<p>- People can only use skill that their ""ancestors"" and ""culture"" created. This means if this friend wants to showcase his Didgeridoo playing but he's no Australian mate, he WON'T play the Didgeridoo. Same goes for reggae tunes which can only be used if you are all jamaican (This is a very important point: while I may think this is doing a tribute to Bob Marley, this is actually ""stoner racism"").<p>- Include minorities in my video. The more tokens, the more communities will watch my video and like it.<p>- Remind myself that if a ""white male"" is ever in the front row of my video, I am promoting white supremacy and sexism.<p>- That girl who wants to dance in the background because she thinks it's fun and doesn't like singing/doesn't want too much exposure?

5503262,comment,5502884,5502884,26,0,yaakov34,,,"A small personal peeve: it doesn't make sense to say that Sudoku is NP-hard, as the linked post does (or NP-complete). First of all, this benchmark (as far as I can tell) uses only traditional 9x9 puzzles, of which there is a finite number. Problems with a finite input space are trivial from the point of view of complexity theory; in order to talk about any kind of completeness or hardness results, you need to generalize Sudoku by defining NxN problems in some way.<p>Moreover, once you define NxN Sudoku (the generalization is easy), you need to pick the problem for which you want to prove a hardness result. The decision problem is typically defined as ""given an instance of a problem, determine if there is a solution"". For Sudoku, you would need to decide if a partial grid can be completed to a full grid, i.e. if the given puzzle is solvable. This has been proven to be NP-complete. However, this is not how the puzzle is usually done, including in this benchmark: you are given a puzzle which is <i>known</i> to have a solution, and the solution is <i>known</i> to be unique. You then need to find the solution. It's been shown that such a Sudoku problem is equivalent to the unambiguous satisfiability problem (given a logical formula which has a unique variable assignment that satisfies it, find that assignment). Now the unambiguous satisfiability problem is not known to be NP-complete when phrased as a decision problem.<p>Anyway, don't just throw around terms like ""NP-hard"". :)<p>EDIT: edited ""unique satisfiability"" to ""unambiguous satisfiability"". I believe this is the correct terminology for the ""promise"" version of the problem which I described, and to which Sudoku is equivalent. (The unique satisfiability problem is ""decide if a logical formula has exactly one solution"", where you are not told if it has more than one, none, or just one).",1365246525

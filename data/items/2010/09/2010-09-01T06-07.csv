At bare minimum, people want upper and lower-case QWERTY for text entry, the telephone-style 123/456/789/0 number pad for phone numbers, plus a reasonable number of easily-accessible symbols.  Even with an on-screen keyboard, I don't think you're going to do it without modifier keys or something like them, and I think you'd be hard pressed -- given the familiarity users have with modifier keys -- to do better.<p>If we're kvetching, though, why don't more phones allow you to enter phone numbers as alphanumeric, and do the conversion to numbers behind-the-scenes?  I shouldn't have to fire up some 3rd party app in order to dial ""1800 GO FEDEX"" ... I should be able to type that right in like any other number and have the phone figure out that G=4, O=6, etc.  The Blackberry lets you hold down Alt and type, but that's awkward and doesn't let you easily recognize a miskey.

Also, you can use something like God or Bluepill (I use the latter) to monitor these processes and reboot them if they lock up.  It seems monit would also work well for you.  The key thing here is the monitoring, as you can restart processes if they lock, and nginx will just skip over that port and use another process that is not locked/restarting.

There are lots of great things about Java, some a direct result of it's popularity: Fantastic tools, a tonne of very mature and reliable open source libraries, great performance in most situations, and last but not least: A tonne of jobs.<p>By no means is Java dying. A lot of sexy new technologies are rooted in Java. Here's 3 popular among the HNers: Clojure, Cassandra, and JRuby. You wanna hack on any of these, you better know Java.<p>Java is far from perfect but it's also very far from horrible. It is most definitely <i>useful</i>. Take the course. You'll learn a lot.",1283321398

X-ray can NEVER reproduce color in the visible spectrum.<p>Artificially colorized SEM and Hubble images trick us into believing otherwise, but I am not aware of any way to extract the color of an object without shining it with that wavelength of light.

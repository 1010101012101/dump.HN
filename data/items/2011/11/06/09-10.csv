I think it was there because ""classic"" ASP had support for doing server-side scripting in JScript, so somebody thought ASP.NET needed to support it also.

So in order for my programs to work I needed to constantly define what type things were.  The other big problem I had was whenever I tried to follow examples they didn't work because there is an arcane system of importing libraries or knowing some long function name.  The language doesn't seem to have any universal functions.  You have to import everything.  If this changes any of that then I might use it.  I really like the idea of programs being able to run on any operating system.  Oh one more thing is the eclipse IDE seems to have so many different set ups and ways to download it how can you know which is the right one?",1320570324

In other words there is a tention between stability and speed of development, a very ""hard"" tention indeed. It is up to the developers culture and sensibility to balance the two ingredients in the best way.<p>One of the reasons I don't want to create a company around Redis, but want to stay with VMware forever as an employee developing Redis, is that I don't want development pressures that are not drive by: users, technical arguments. So that I can balance speed of development and stability as I (and the other developers) feel right.<p>Without direct reference to 10gen I guess this is harder when there is a product-focused company around the product (but I don't know how true this is for 10gen as I don't follow very closely the development and behavior of other NoSQL products).",1320570218

That seemed to suggest tht even in 1906, an opposite grading emphasizing 'mapleness' could have taken root. Perhaps the regulators simply made the mistake of using the word 'grade'  implying a quality rank  when really their assessment was only of  categories without any inherent preference ordering.)",1320570191

So our amazing engineers are responsible for storing hundreds of millions of pieces of data per week AND also crunching and analyzing that data. So basically we need a system where we can have incredible write and read performance but also a system that is elastic in nature. Most importantly, it has to be available.<p>Before I go into more details, MongoDB is great for most people who don't have a high transaction volume. It is easy to setup and easy to use. So if you are in this camp, MongoDB is probably a good fit for you.<p>We did about two months worth of extensive tests in our lab. Basically two things didn't bode well for us. One, the locking killed reading...we just had a hard time keeping the flow of writes and the flow of data to our statistics cluster alive. Yea, you could use replication but that too didn't work too well performance wise. Two, the sharding didn't seem that robust. As the cluster got bigger and bigger, we started noticing the overhead of keeping it up was getting to be too great.

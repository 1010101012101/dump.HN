If we find it, we put a stop to it. And suppliers found violating our zero tolerance policy are put on probation. Our Underage Labor Remediation Program requires that any supplier found hiring underage workers fund the worker’s safe return home. Suppliers also have to fully finance the worker’s education at a school chosen by the worker and his or her family, continue to pay the worker’s wages, and offer the worker a job when he or she reaches the legal age. Of more than 1.6 million workers covered in 633 audits in 2014, 16 cases of underage labor were discovered at six facilities — and all were successfully remediated. This means that underage labor now accounts for 0.001 percent of the total work population audited in our supply chain. Although this number is low, even one case of underage labor is unacceptable. So we won’t stop until it’s eliminated from our supply chain entirely.</i><p><a href=""https://www.apple.com/supplier-responsibility/labor-and-human-rights/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.apple.com/supplier-responsibility/labor-and-huma...</a>",1453200710

And from an English perspective I certainly wouldn&#x27;t eulogise the Unions in the way this article does either.  My father (now retired) was a member of the EETPU (Electrician&#x27;s Union).  It was seen as a &quot;right-wing&quot; Union because its constitution banned communists from holding any positions within the Union - but that was because communist activists and their aggressive confrontational policies had almost wrecked the Union.  The EETPU dealt with the problem, other Unions, the NUM (National Union of Mineworkers) did not.  It was their aggressive confrontational policies that wrecked worker solidarity in private industry.<p>The article touches on the breakdown of other social support as well.  Marriage for example.  And yet doesn&#x27;t touch on why this might be.  I have a son and two daughters.  I have told my daughters that they must get married, and my son that he should definitely not.  Why?  Because divorce laws are so anti-male that nowadays it makes no sense for a man to marry.  (And yes, I cynically want my daughters to gain this protection).<p>In the UK there used to be a massive culture of socialising in &quot;pubs&quot; (public houses, or &quot;bars&quot;).  Legislative changes ranging from allowing the 24 hour sale of cheap alcohol in supermarkets coupled with anti-smoking legislation that makes it illegal to smoke inside pubs have driven away a large chunk of that trade.  I am a non-smoker but would prefer an open pub that allows smoking than no pub at all.  This is important because pubs are also traditionally where different social classes meet and mingle as equals as well as where young people used to learn to drink responsibly under the watchful eye of the landlord and older drinkers - now they are likely to get totally smashed on alco-pops out of sight.<p>Then there&#x27;s the impact of mass immigration on social housing and the resultant disruption of traditional communities.<p>The traditional working classes (my background) are already under assault even before we add in the coming tide of job losses through automation.  These are all good reasons for supporting a move to a Basic Citizen&#x27;s Income as soon as possible.",1453200483

A lot of French tech companies that &quot;move to the US&quot; actually keep a subsidiary with their development team in France.

The problem is the growth stage and beyond. The French market is too large to force companies to think global from the start and too small to scale for most.

I&#x27;m sorry to have been insensitive.<p>I&#x27;d also like to say that I am absolutely against raising of noise levels because that sucks for coding and also life in general. I&#x27;m deaf, but not completely deaf, and I also have a condition called &quot;recruitment&quot; which is a form of noise sensitivity that you can read about here: <a href=""http://www.hyperacusis.net/hyperacusis/hyperacusis+or+recruitment/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hyperacusis.net/hyperacusis/hyperacusis+or+recrui...</a> Recruitment makes noisy office environments an absolute nightmare for me and I&#x27;ve been known to take my damn laptop and go the hell home and work there if the noise levels ramp up.<p>Sociability in programmers takes many forms, and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a coincidence that sites like HN and stackoverflow are so popular with devs - that&#x27;s a way of very sociable without actually having to speak to people in meatspace. Programming has probably more of its fair share of introverts and non-neurotypical peeps, partly because of the requirement for peace and quiet while you&#x27;re working out hard problems. I think it&#x27;s also partly because as a group we&#x27;re more accepting of others&#x27; needs and differences. Mack Collier did a great post on this, and it&#x27;s this sort of concept I was thinking about when I wrote that part of the article: <a href=""http://mackcollier.com/why-introverts-love-social-media/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mackcollier.com/why-introverts-love-social-media/</a><p>So once again, sorry for making you feel shitty.

Do you just have a road sign with 42 miles to x, or a building with 8 windows?<p>It could be anything, what you said would work beautifully if it has occurred spontaneously to you. The key thing is it has to be very very natural to you but may not make any sense at all to others.<p>Example, one of the building I have assigned the number 78 as it is an old building and my father&#x27;s age is around that.<p>> do all the landmarks need to be unique<p>Again it is a very personal decision. For me currently it is one pair of number per landmark as I did not want to &#x27;overload&#x27; my system.\nBut if I think about it now, maybe after sometime when I&#x27;m comfortable with my current system I can assign another number to the same landmark...

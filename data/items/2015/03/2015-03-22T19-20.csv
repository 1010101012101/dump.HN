A lot of the teaching is just about slowing down and watching what you are doing (and what happens automatically).<p>For example, try squatting but keeping your heels on the floor. You will likely not be able to do it. Now if you could lie on your back, with feet on the floor and get someone to raise the rest of your body to a squat position, then it would probably happen. The action of squatting will trigger lots of habitual muscular responses that your brain didn&#x27;t specifically ask for. If you are put in that position from a non conventional way, the muscles raising your heels won&#x27;t be triggered.<p>Or a basic example. Stand straight and look ahead. Now imagine that you are in the start up line for 100m sprint. Now really try to imagine you are there. Now check your legs. Is there tension in one of them, ready to sprint off? Did you consciously do that?<p>The lessons explore these habitual responses, so that once you recognise them you have the choice to carry on habitually, or do something in a new way.<p>As I say, its difficult to describe.",1427054033

I&#x27;m originally from the area and I even wrote a large research paper about this when I was in college.<p>The short story is that many of the rich elite of the late 1880s would vacation near a man made dam in South Fork PA. The hills of the Alleghenies are ominous with a water migration route that leads straight into downtown Johnstown, which was then a bustling steel town. On May 31, 1889 a historic rain caused the dam to fail. This caused a wall of water to crash upon Johnstown, leading to 2209 deaths and what was effectively the destruction of the city. It was one of the first big stories in the post-antebellum nation and also was one of the first disasters which the American Red Cross and Clara Barton were onsite to help with.<p>The common story and moral derived from said story is that the rich patrons that owned the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club did not maintain the dam which caused the dam to fail which was responsible for the fatalities caused by the flood. Lawsuits were dismissed as the flood was thought to have been an &quot;act of God&quot;. It could be seen today (and was when now-famous historian David McCullough wrote his book about this 1968) as being indicative of how rich and the 1% lead to the direct damage and destruction of the lower class.<p>As someone who has researched it, there is far more to it than that. But, kinda cool to see it posted here.",1427053921

9247975,comment,9244005,9246154,0,0,rektide,,,"Your focus on GTOR explaining techniques is madness. It&#x27;s clearly not about that, yet you keep descending beyond the general in GTOR and into the specific implementations. You have some priority, some thing that has to be fulfilled, and you are fixated entirely upon this square-1 position and unable to see anything beyond that. I think if you could find the general, you&#x27;d see that your preferred expressivities- imperative systems- enact the same kinds of GENERAL couplings. Whether it&#x27;s implicit or explicit, it&#x27;s still a general conception and we have to think about it and have mental models that understand coupling/reaction.<p>And those things GTOR does use in square 1 are fine. Your heavyhanded rejection of them is colosssaly sad and twisted. If a mental construct suits a problem and helps you think of it, that&#x27;s what is important. The programmatic platform follows our ability to think, it does not define it, yet you keep insisting the cart must come first, that the platform has to be a certain way or else or else or else. FUD. FUD FUD FUD.<p>It&#x27;s using the references that everyone on the planet but those of your little cultish view know to explain <i>general ways of thinking</i> about things. Your unwillingness to see parity between the general ideas put forward because it&#x27;s not your favored implementation reads grossly to me. Observers, contracts, data-flow are real, graspable concepts and if they closely model how you want to think about a problem then they are most definitely good concepts, and it&#x27;s up to the platform to have good ways to express natural thought. I still have an enormously hard time decyphering the mad mess of shibboleths you toss out, activating your elitist trope of true beleievers (and I&#x27;m not a complete neophyte to your clique myself), but I am 100% sure, as I stated in my first paragraph, that all systems enact a coupling/reactivity. Control, whether it&#x27;s explicit or implicit in the flow, is still the chief thing entailed in mentally modeling and putting into practice: this is unrejectable.<p>In particular, your bringing up of the referential transparency doubles down on my prime criticism in the previous: you bring up points that you claim contend, but you provide no support, no structure where anyone but those already attuned to your brand of thought can get onboard with you. Your claims are uncontestable, because they are indecypherable. They claim a split, but don&#x27;t deign to point out what that split is. That, culturally, is a big indicator to me.<p>Your case rests around whether or not reactivity is a general thing or not, and I think it&#x27;s quite clear we can find these concepts embodied in any system.",1427053794

Running a KC-135 and a crew of 4-8 to deliver the fuel at altitude isn&#x27;t going to be cheap.<p>JP-8 fuel appears to cost around $3.00/gallon at ground level, so a factor of 15 would be $45/gallon delivered.<p>JP-8 has a density of about 0.8 kg/l, or about 6 lb/gallon.<p>Civilian airline fares are somewhere in the neighborhood of $0.20/seat-mile.

The first level neurons in deep learning systems learn to utilize gradients in a way that is similar to hand-crafted features such as SIFT and HOG.  Objects used to be found in a sliding-window fashion, but now it is easier and sexier to think of this operation as convolving an image with a filter. Some of the best detection systems used to use multiple linear SVMs, combined in some ad-hoc way, and now we are essentially using even more of such linear decision boundaries.  Deep learning systems can be thought of a multiple stages of applying linear operators and piping them through a non-linear activation function, but deep learning is more similar to a clever combination of linear SVMs than a memory-ish Kernel-based learning system.<p>>  Features these days aren&#x27;t engineered by hand.  However, architectures of Deep systems are still being designed manually -- and it looks like the experts are the best at this task.  The operations on the inside of both classic and modern recognition systems are still very much the same.

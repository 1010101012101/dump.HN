[1] lists a series of accidents with kerosene lamps in a three year period in a small town.  I think a horse kicking over a kerosene lantern started one of the big Chicago fires.  There&#x27;s even a possibility that a kerosene lamp caused a deadly fire in modern USA [2].

It took multiple Sparrows to even have a chance of killing a target. I believe their Pk was below 20% and was often as low as 9%. Early Sidewinders were more reliable, but had a narrow engagement envelope. And pilot training completely eliminated any work on how to conduct traditional dogfights. This was a recipe for lots of aircraft and aircrew losses.<p>However, the aerospace industry and government have not stood still. Newer missiles are orders of magnitude more reliable and capable. High off boresight missiles mean that pilots can engage targets from a wide variety of angles. Seeker technology is amazingly better.",1438390553

9985350,comment,9981838,9985156,0,0,ancap,,,">Your original question must have been one of morality, not law.<p>You are correct in your assumption. Perhaps I should be more explicit in that premise, as this seems to get lost on a lot of people. My fault.<p>>My response is that I, personally, don&#x27;t think property is moral or immoral because I do not take it as a priori. It is a human system.<p>Surely, property in and of itself is not moral or immoral because we are talking about inanimate things. But the ownership of property, if you agree that property can be owned, does lead to questions of morality.<p>I am not sure I follow when you say property is a &quot;human system... it has consequences&quot;. Surely all discussion of morality involve humans, correct? We certainly don&#x27;t condemn lions as immoral for killing and eating antelope; or the mallard for reproducing forcibly with a less than willing female.<p>>What notion of property do you have?<p>I am of the belief that property is an essential element of liberty. If someone has the right to say what they want, or worship how they will, or have relationships with others how they see fit, or whatever they want that is not initiating violence against others, that right is valid as long as they have property to perform those rights on. They cannot go on someone else&#x27;s property and be entitled to act however they want, without the owner&#x27;s permission.<p>Now, just to be clear, I am not talking in the context of our current system, even though there are similarities. I am talking theoretically. This is important because I believe property rights pre-exist the state; that the right to own property is a natural, inalienable right. (In case there&#x27;s any confusion when I say &quot;right to own property&quot; I do not mean that everyone is entitled to have property, but rather the rights which someone has as a property owner). So I would disagree with your statement that &quot;property rights regulated by the authority that justifies them as legitimate,&quot; assuming the &quot;authority&quot; you refer to is the state.<p>With the view of a natural right to property, it is clear that theft is a &quot;crime&quot; even absent codified law. Furthermore, any codified law which sanctions theft in any form is a violation of natural rights, is immoral and is invalid.<p>>My personal views on property are most certainly fringe.<p>You are in good company. While many believe in the notion of natural rights, few hold an intellectually consistent view in applying what it would mean to respect natural rights today.<p>Edit: up vote for you for fostering an intelligent conversation and not resorting to ad hominem attacks.",1438390138
9985349,story,,,1,0,rebootthesystem,"Ask HN: Windows 10 Local Backups and Hardware Migration?",,"We&#x27;ve been using Ghost for years. Yeah, it&#x27;s got warts and yes, it has caused data loss. The &quot;feature&quot; I hate the most is how it can fail silently. If it can&#x27;t complete a backup for any reason you can go days and weeks without knowing it. There&#x27;s no way to tell it to put-up a big red warning window on the screen if, for example, the backup destination drive is full, can&#x27;t connect to it or any other failure. I think it changes the little icon on the task-bar but that&#x27;s pretty much lame.

I definitely want to hear form HN&#x27;ers who might have experience doing this.<p>Context: Our engineering systems have four hard drives and tons of software on them. It takes a solid month to migrate a machine to new hardware because you pretty much have to start from scratch and re-install everything.<p>This, BTW, is one of my HUGE disappointments with Microsoft. In the old days applications and the OS were decoupled. Today, if we need to migrate to a bigger-faster machine with a newer OS we have to start from scratch and reinstall applications such as SolidWorks (with all the add-ons we have), Xilinx tools, EDA tools, compilers, file viewers, Office, editors, etc. It&#x27;s a nightmare.<p>And that&#x27;s why most of our engineering systems are still running Vista. You just get stuck because migrations are very costly in terms of man-hours, not dollars.<p>We are now looking to migrate to Windows 10 and the question of backup, drive imaging and restoration has come-up.

Another phrase used in many papers is &quot;moving target.&quot; I called it Security through Diversity in my own work. A quick Google shows most of us were similarly [not] creative. ;)<p>I used diversity extensively in my previous security work combined with obfuscation and strong, interface protection. Best protection against nation-state attacks on software. Simplest example was running requests a group at a time on three separate systems with different ISA&#x27;s and toolchains while checking results. Another form of that I derived was having mutually suspicious parties do different implementations of same behavior. The approach I used most was just constantly changing implementation details of key services, from the app to the code serving the interface. Interface attempts to hide all details of implementation plus sanitize the input. Result is indeed a moving target that they rarely hit or expand on.<p>Modern IT is expected to be much more efficient in terms of labor and productivity. Unreasonably so I&#x27;ll add. The best way to do diversification now is doing (a) portable software + interfaces, (b) containerizing implementations for easy swapping, and (c) using automated methods being developed in academia to diversify code without human intervention. Two of these can piggy-back on existing work in OSS and cloud tech.

Previous generations of jet fighters could be designed, tested, fielded, and retired within as little as 10 years as the speed of technology development increased ever faster. The reasons why 4th generation aircraft have been able to last so long are numerous. I&#x27;ll take a quick stab at it.<p>1) There haven&#x27;t been any radical innovations in jet propulsion. Sure, the latest engines from GE or P&W are more efficient than the engines of the 80s, but not dramatically so.
2) The 4th generation fighters were well designed with an eye for systems growth, precisely because the government grew tired of continually developing new fighters. Insert here whatever impact you wish to give to the &quot;fighter mafia&quot;. These aircraft were able to take advantage of digital data buses and fly by wire technologies, which were new and allowed for years and years of expansion and growth. Point-to-point wired aircraft just get really difficult to improve past a certain point.
3) Improvements in materials and manufacturing techniques incorporated into the 4th generation gave them longer service lives.<p>I could keep going. But you get the idea. The 4th generation was wildly successful.<p>And thank you for that fas.org link, it appears to be a good gathering of facts upon my initial perusal.",1438389225

Likewise, if a client is caching connections outside of zookeeper&#x27;s consensus mechanism, then these connections will also become stale in the face of changes.<p>Given these possibilities, there is always the potential for traffic to be dropped on the floor regardless of how consistent your store is, so ultimately what matters is how to minimize the probability of this occurring and whether your system can cope when it does.",1438388882

They quote from a presentation given by Richard George from the NSA twice in this paper. I had seen that presentation before, and in it he speaks to why the algorithm was put in the NIST standard[1] and directly answers a question regarding how the P and Q in the standard were generated[2].<p>His claim was that the NSA had issues in the past getting encryption devices certified for use in unclassified environments because NSA controlled the certification process for classified encryption algorithms (which were themselves generally classified), but NIST controlled the certification for government use in unclassified settings (and these algorithms could not be classified).  The NSA wanted to be able to use an existing algorithm in an unclassified setting.  As the article <i>does</i> point out, Mr. George stated that the algorithm was intended primarily for their own internal use and user should be able to use any P and Q, though they needed their own P and Q certified for their own use.<p>Later on in the presentation he states that the P and Q were both non-deterministically generated random numbers.  He states that the NSA has office devoted specifically to producing random numbers for their own use, and they just got the P and Q from there.<p>Whether or not you believe this claim is an entirely different and reasonable question (there&#x27;s no real way to verify it), but why bother quoting him if you&#x27;re going to selectively quote like this?  If the P and Q are in fact purely random as Mr. George claims, Dual_EC goes from being a grand conspiracy to just a slow, crappy PRNG.  I think selectively quoting to make this guy sound more sinister makes it look like the author <i>wants</i> it to be a grand conspiracy and just undermines the argument.<p>Btw., the entire presentation is worth watching if you have time - he goes into the history of DES, espionage between the US and Soviets, getting cryptographic equipment working in tanks, etc...<p>[1] <a href=""http://vimeo.com/97891042"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vimeo.com/97891042</a> (jump to 57:53)<p>[2] Same video, jump to 30:14",1438387926

9985196,comment,9984272,9985179,0,0,chimeracoder,,,"> I had an argument recently with someone who is anti-abortion and his opinion is that life starts when sperm and egg meet. Anything preventing implantation of an egg is essentially killing of a baby<p>This is a pretty common opinion among anti-choice people. One of the many divides in views on abortion is between people who believe life begins at birth vs. before birth, with a significant number of the latter believing life begins at conception.<p><i>EDIT</i>: Obviously views on abortion are complicated and vary widely. All I&#x27;m saying is that it&#x27;s really not hard to find people who will tell you life begins at conception (and by that logic, believe that killing a fertilized egg is equivalent to killing a baby).",1438387246

Two copies of the same code?  Great, which one do I fix?  Both?  How do I test that it worked, I can&#x27;t even figure out where #2 is activated in the UI?!  Is there something a little different about them that I need to watch out for?  And test cases for said codebase?  Hahahahaha!",1438387235

They paid me 1x GSoC (one week&#x27;s engineer salary) for more than a year of work once. Um, it seemed like a good idea at the time.",1438387212

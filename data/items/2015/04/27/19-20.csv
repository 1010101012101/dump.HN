And if its really <i>correctness</i> you&#x27;re worried about, rather than just going for a better grade, then you should be okay with a full on review.

9448712,comment,9447097,9447097,0,0,kens,,,"The architecture manual for the Intel iAPX 432 processor reads like alternate-world science fiction. [1] This processor came out in 1981 and was supposed to be the revolutionary new thing in computers. It failed and was mostly forgotten, but the world would be very different if it had replaced x86.<p>The 432 had incredible hype: &quot;The vacuum tube, the transistor, the microprocessor - at least once in a generation an electronic device arises to shock and strain designers&#x27; understanding. The latest such device is the iAPX 432 micromainframe processor, a processor as different from the current crop of microprocessors (and indeed, mainframes) as those devices are from the early electromechanical analog computers of the 1940&#x27;s.&quot; [2]<p>This 32-bit machine had some very unusual features. It implemented support for objects at the hardware level, with access protection for on a per-object basis. Even the kernel doesn&#x27;t have access to everything. The world would be much more secure with no more buffer-overflow exploits.<p>This chip was started before the 8086 and included a virtual address space of 2^48 bytes. It was designed to be programmed entirely in high-level languages.The processor also included garbage collection in hardware. It also supported floating point and multi-processor operation, well before x86 did. Part of the operating system was built into the chip; the policies were defined in software, but the implementation was on the chip.<p>It&#x27;s interesting to think what computers and programming would be like if the Intel 432 had succeeded instead of x86. We&#x27;d probably have super-secure computers and be programming in Ada.<p>[1] <a href=""http://bitsavers.org/pdf/intel/iAPX_432/171821-001_Introduction_to_the_iAPX_432_Architecture_Aug81.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bitsavers.org/pdf/intel/iAPX_432/171821-001_Introduct...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://archive.org/stream/Intel-AR-166UnderstandTheNewestProcessorToAvoidFutureShockOCR#page/n3/mode/2up"" rel=""nofollow"">https://archive.org/stream/Intel-AR-166UnderstandTheNewestPr...</a>",1430164698

9448700,comment,9446980,9447634,0,0,useerup,,,"> My understanding is that PowerShell is passing around specialized objects that have a few required methods, and some source specific ones.<p>I don&#x27;t believe that PS objects need to have any specific methods. Maybe only ToString() - but that is always auto implemented.<p>> The beauty of this is that you can pass massive amounts of data without serializing and unserializing it at every step, and also that they can contain links to other information, such as links to parent objects which may or may not be part of the same list (I have no idea if this is allowed, but it seems a logical extension of the concept).<p>Well, that&#x27;s part of it. The fact that there is no need for serialization/deserialization between the commands has some obvious performance benefits (and a few drawbacks). But it is also what enables the perhaps most overlooked but most important characteristics of PowerShell: You can use it in-process to manipulate in-memory objects of the hosting process. This means that you can implement the management functions as PS cmdlets, and <i>still</i> build an admin GUI using those cmdlets but where the GUI is a rich process with in-memory objects that is just passed to cmdlets. Think how a task manager could be written to list the processes on the machine by invoking Get-Process. The objects returned represent the actual processes - complete with methods and properties. The GUI can hold on to those objects, and when you pick one and choose the &quot;Stop&quot; action (for instance) it could pass it as input to Stop-Process (kill). This is actually what a number of product-specific GUIs from Microsoft do, e.g. Exchange.<p>> The downside is that tools need to buy into this and work with this data stream rather than text, which makes the set of available tools necessarily much smaller.<p>Yes - it is a new model, and the commands need to support it to take full advantage. There is a &quot;bridge&quot; from the old world to the new in that the &quot;old&quot; command types are simply seen as commands that consume and produce sequences of strings. But yes - there still is some friction. The model works at it best when you can do all of your tasks using cmdlets.<p>At some level I suspect that PowerShell has been blessed with a rather poor CLI ecosystem on Windows preceding it. It didn&#x27;t have to knock anything existing from the throne; rather it hit a vacuum and was almost immediately adopted. The same wouldn&#x27;t have been the case on Linux/Unix.<p>There is an impressive number of cmdlets available now, however. On my machine &quot;gcm|measure&quot; tells me that there are 1484 commands available. Those are only those distributed from Microsoft, and the cover all sort of administration, firewall, sqlserver, file transfer, disk management, low level network managent, print management, start screen, user management etc. I don&#x27;t think it is on par with what the Linux/Unix community has available now, but it is getting there, quickly.",1430164510

If the lawyer&#x27;s salary + benefits + retirement contribution is 150k per year, they would need $75 per hour to cover this cost. Since the lawyer is working for a big firm which has high overhead costs and a goal of returning profit to their partners, the amount that they bill typically 3X their hourly salary (3X $75 = $225). This is why it is so expensive to hire an attorney. For large corporations, this fee is reasonable since they have millions of dollars at stake in an M&A transaction, IPO deal, or patent litigation.

Earlier that year OpenBSD had been found to contain code that had been copied from a Linux GPL wireless driver project, in violation of the GPL. The Linux developers made a public mailing list posting about it and a lot of drama ensued:<p><a href=""http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel.wireless.general/1558"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel.wireless.general/...</a><p>Theo got very upset that the Linux devs practised &#x27;full disclosure&#x27; over the violation and didn&#x27;t contact OpenBSD privately (presumably he thinks customers who make use of OpenBSD should be fully informed about security threats that affect them, but not informed at all about legal threats that might put them at risk). He also tried to argue that the multiple commits over a period of time that contained copy and pasted GPL code was accidental, and got very upset when people suggested that one couldn&#x27;t possibly accidentally copy specific portions of a GPL codebase and commit it to the repo multiple times. Theo also tried to argue that it wasn&#x27;t a copyright violation since the code wasn&#x27;t actually run-able (he knows full well that isn&#x27;t how copyright law works).<p>The Linux developers response to that incident was also possibly partly motivated by earlier requests by some Linux developers for OpenBSD to dual licence portions of a different driver (i.e. also make it GPL). OpenBSD refused, for some of the reasons discussed already in this thread (they would likely receive GPL licensed changes that they would not be able to use). The strong reaction from the Linux devs was maybe to be expected after they had been told they couldn&#x27;t use OpenBSD code, but then found OpenBSD had been stealing their code.<p>So there was a great big mess of egos and petty squabbling. I think a lot of that motivated the later copyright violations in the atheros drivers by the Linux developers that Theo is (rightly) complaining about above.",1430163860

Here are some tips:<p>- Try to get a referral. This is by far the easiest way to stand out if you are not from some of the top colleges the company is actively targeting (top tier firms go on campus recruiting trips to the best schools in US and they get most of their candidates from that pool). Explore your network - do you know anyone that went to your school and now works at one of these companies? Ping them.<p>- Start applying early. Usually the company decides upfront how many internships they&#x27;re going to offer that year. So if you apply late, your changes of getting in are lower - they&#x27;ve very few slots left and they can be very selective. Go on LinkedIn and look for recruiters from the company who handle University Recruiting specifically. Ping them and ask them about internships and their recruiting schedule.<p>- Try applying to companies in Europe like someone else suggested.<p>Also don&#x27;t worry too much if you don&#x27;t get into your dream internship now - it&#x27;s not the end of the world. I have been in a similar boat - I went to school in Singapore and I got rejected by every single company in your list for internships (my school is one of the top 3 schools in Asia but that still didn&#x27;t help). Instead I ended up interning at some local startups. 6 years later things have changed - I&#x27;ve worked for some of the companies on your list and every company that has rejected me in the past is now trying to actively recruit me.

Instead, ansible uses YAML playbooks that degrade very nicely to shell commands[0]. You can literally take almost any shell script and turn it into an Ansible playbook with a series of Vim regexes - or heck, write a simple sed script to translate it automatically.<p>Of course, if you use Ansible modules instead of the `command` directive, you get a lot of performance benefits and guarantees of idempotency. But it doesn&#x27;t try to reinvent the wheel; it just builds on top of it.<p>It makes it really easy to hack together an Ansible script that is immediately understood by anyone who&#x27;s used bash/sh and it makes it possible to improve upon it incrementally by replacing shell commands with the relevant Ansible modules.<p>I&#x27;ve used other automation tools, and the thing that I really disliked about them was that it was so difficult to migrate an existing workflow to a new paradigm. In 2015, systems work is still very imperative, so while declarative syntax is philosophically attractive, I still find it way more practical to use the tools that require smaller mental leaps.<p>[0] e.g., this thing was hacked together from a shell script, and I never bothered to clean it up, but it&#x27;s still already more readable than the equivalent shell script: <a href=""https://github.com/ChimeraCoder/znc-kibana-playbooks/blob/master/addswap.yml"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/ChimeraCoder/znc-kibana-playbooks/blob/ma...</a>",1430162208

You can also write them in a .NET language, like C#, F# or VB.NET.<p>I disagree that it is painful to write cmdlets in C#. A cmdlet is just a class, the parameters are just properties annotated with the [Parameter] attribute. The shell does all of the parameter parsing, matching and type conversion/coercion. If I wrote a traditional commandline tool I&#x27;d have to do that parsing myself. Yes, I could use a library function like getopt for that - but the code and complexity would still be there.<p>But my point was not to get anyone to use PowerShell on Unix/Linux. PowerShell draws much of it strength on Windows from the fact that there are already well-established object models on that platform (COM, .NET and WMI/CIM).<p>The point was that the age-old text-only view in command shells is beginning to show some shortcomings.

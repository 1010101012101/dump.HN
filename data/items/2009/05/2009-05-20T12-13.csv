The ""market,"" ""capital,"" and the ""financial system"" are nothing but totems (created by our labor) that we worship as if they were given to us by the gods.<p>Interesting, too, that the author pairs harmony and beauty as having ""intrinsic"" value. We <i>might</i> think of beauty  as intrinsically valuable but, once you name any created object beautiful, that beauty is rife with cultural baggage that defines what is and what is not valuable. Which brings me to my next point.<p>To call one object beautiful necessarily means that other objects are not beautiful, or are less beautiful, or are beautiful in a different way. As far as I'm concerned there is nothing ""harmonious"" about this act. Thus, how can beauty and harmony be intrinsically valuable or ""good"" when beauty necessarily excludes harmony?<p>I guess I'm not a big fan of moral philosophy.",1242823787

They are not the same as MyTemplate<T>. This is by choice of ML language implementors, as they see it as a defect of C++ that every template instantiation has to be compiled independently. Instead, they turn static compile-time polymorphism into run-time dynamism using indirection and function pointers. (Maybe MLton doesn't do this, but I know GHC does.)<p>It's the difference between C's qsort and C++'s std::sort. The latter blows the former out of the water when sorting small things. This brand of polymorphism is unique to C++ and until someone does it better (which no one seems to have any interest in, except maybe Walter Bright) then C++ will always be ""the best C.""",1242822833

618404,comment,618295,618295,0,0,cousin_it,,,"I'll go for a point-by-point critique.<p>Point 1 tacitly assumes that learning C++ not only teaches you a common subset of many other popular languages, but also is the easiest way to learn said subset. This is wrong: a lot of simpler languages can teach you the same, e.g. JavaScript or pre-1.5 Java.<p>Point 3 says a given code sample in the wild has higher probability of being in C++ than any other language. This clashes with my impressions.<p>Point 4 assumes that the main difficulty of C++ is due to pointers and manual memory management, and that knowing your way around those issues will help you in other programming areas anyway. This sounds wrong to me: C shares those ""difficulties"" with C++ and isn't generally regarded as a hard language. The difficulty of C++ mostly stems from design decisions unique to C++ and useless elsewhere, like template metaprogramming or the dangerous combination of manual memory management with exception handling.<p>Point 5 implies that C++ invented parametric polymorphism and that this facility is essential to make algorithms work on a variety of data types. Wrong on both counts: ML and Ada generics predate C++, and Smalltalk-like dynamically typed languages solve the same problem without type parameterization.<p>Point 6 assumes more libraries have C++ interfaces than C interfaces, which is wrong by an order of magnitude at least.<p>Point 9 assumes most programmers are more interested in performance-oriented and algorithmically complex projects. Can't give statistics here, but I'm a data point to the contrary: I love UI and frontend work.<p>Point 10 is valid.<p>My own reasons for knowing C++ are a combination of point 10 and the need to muck around with <a href=""http://mapnik.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mapnik.org</a> - the only C++ library I ever found useful.

10895147,comment,10890907,10892564,0,0,x2398dh1,,,"What&#x27;s interesting to me about the Falun Gong is the relation I draw between the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom (THK) movement and the Falun Gong. In the 1800s, the THK lead the Taiping Rebellion, a massive civil war in which the THK took over Nanjing and large amounts of Chinese Territory.  I believe that the Communist Party of China&#x27;s arguably overly-egressive response against the Falun Gong, which yes is rightfully an unscrupulous cult, is indicative of their own insecurities about how they maintain power.  There are many people in China that commit all manner of scams, being that it is a country with a wide variety of income classes - America, for one, is the same in that regard.  There are many racist, homophobic, sexist and misogynistic, wild cults in other societies - but that is what comes with pluralistic societies, which China is not being that they are one-party ruled.  The key question is - why does the Communist Party of China attack the Falun Gong so disproportionately aggressively over how it does to other organizations and forces within its own country who perpetrate similar ills?  One is tempted to think that the answer lies within the size, strength and power of what the Falun Gong had attained in the 1990s, coupled with the historical allegory of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom.  I believe that more than anything, the Communist Party is trying to protect its rule of the country, as well as the general order and progression of society, as is their philosophy as a vanguard socialist movement, rather than a pluralistic movement.",1452700259

The pessimistic, and perhaps condescending, view is that the poor and less-educated don&#x27;t have the intellectual gifts to appraise the odds, but middle-class and rich people play the lottery too.</i><p>This perspective is deeply flawed. If humans obeyed a risk adjusted rate of return strategy and rationally discounted for the future, human behavior across the board would be profoundly different.  The lottery is only one example of many.<p>Any portfolio of early stage startups is destined to perform worse than the S&P500, as is any portfolio of series A startups.  As is any portfolio of lottery tickets... but there is always that winning ticket, that Facebook, that Google.<p>There have been very few big homerun startups. The rest would fail to lift the average above the S&P.<p>In an environment where the future seems fairly certain (poverty, affluence, whatever) there is lots to be gained by rolling the dice and experiencing a bit of risk.  Lotto is less fun than a startup, but it scratches the same itch.  It lets you ride the emotional roller coaster and imagine the greatness that will one day be yours.<p>Startups are a superior version of lotto because you get to be the CEO or the CTO and someone invests their money to help you build a team and get traction, etc.  So your bet with destiny is being underwritten by others.  You get advisors, board members, and metrics, and essentially spread the thrill of the tumbling balls across however long your runway lasts.   The superiority of startups is why young affluent people do them, and why poor people play lotto.<p>The urge to take on risk is what got humans onto ships, rockets, and bathyspheres. It&#x27;s the unique human ability to reason probabilistically and take a leap, to undertake a calculated risk, and to engage in an exciting dance with destiny.<p>For centuries and in pre-enlightenment times, people believed that all of life was fated and that one&#x27;s lot was destined from birth.<p>When we appreciate the emotional thrill of risk we start to see that it&#x27;s part of the glorious awakening of the human sprit birthed in the enlightenment.  When a dejected person puts his last quarter into a slot machine, we are not seeing hopelessness, we are seeing hope in its most unfettered form.  Even if he loses that person will pick himself up and dust off and be ready to try again, for fate is on his side.  This stands in stark contrast with the previous worldview in which the quarter would be saved and a prayer offered up, which has far smaller odds of success than the slot machine.",1452699399

Although I certainly understand the desire of the parent, I&#x27;ve been on both the Ops and Dev side of that fence, and on call REALLY SUCKS (I almost feel dirty in this post agreeing with a statement of &quot;I should be on call&quot; but it is what it is :) ) but it sucks worse if as you say it&#x27;s entirely on the backs of the ops who are also handling sysadmin style work, and are kept more isolated from dev as is typical in &quot;throw it over the wall&quot; shops.  (In writing this I realize I want to clarify that I have other thoughts entirely about having ops specialists instead of suggesting a merge to totally unified devops, but that&#x27;s an entirely other discussion).  Also as you say, ownership/responsibility/etc is also an ancillary benefit.<p>What I actually wanted to say from all this however, is that despite the truth of your argument, I&#x27;d take a third angle.  No on call is bad, but similarly, _unpaid_ OT is bad.  The common rhetoric from this soapbox is that if employers are accountable for this time, it&#x27;ll incentivise them to have processes and hold values that don&#x27;t abuse an expensive resource.  If something is on fire; the on call employee still _will be there to handle it_, but the fact that it&#x27;s become a pro-bono assumed part of many of our jobs in the tech sector is the part I take issue with more than doing the task itself.",1452698793

The solution in general is contract law.<p>The verbal agreement &quot;If you do this and I do that then I will split the money 50/50 with you after the show&quot; is a verbal contract which (due to the cameras recording the event) is nevertheless indisputable.

However most people, in study after study, will be insulted by the disparity of only getting 1% of the winning, and the insult is magnified by the camera: it is public shame.

If you think they are remotely comparable, you don&#x27;t understand how COTRAVELER works.

License plates only show a <i>car&#x27;s</i> location, which may map to one or more <i>people</i>. License plates do not follow you into buildings, across different cars or other forms of transportation.<p>More importantly, it is difficult to participate in modern society without a form of transportation, which is usually a car. The cell phone is absolutely <i>not</i> a requirement, even though a lot of addicted people like to claim otherwise. A landline has none of these tracking issues, and suffices perfectly well for most <i>needs</i> (which are different from <i>wants</i> aka <i>luxuries</i>).<p>So yes, unlike with a car, if you choose to carry a cell phone, you are absolutely contributing to the surveillance state, and pretending otherwise doesn&#x27;t make your culpability in it go away.<p>[1] It doesn&#x27;t see much use these days due to an unfortunate medical situation, but I would be driving that car if it was safe.",1452697306

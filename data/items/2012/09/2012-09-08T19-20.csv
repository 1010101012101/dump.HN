I'm one of the people behind the LMFAO parody ""We're NASA And We Know It"" (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFvNhsWMU0c"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFvNhsWMU0c</a>) and the LaughPong channel (www.youtube.com/laughpong). It's awesome to see stuff you create like this explode - congrats!<p>Just a few notes about how Youtube works:
Chances are, you got a lot more views in the first 24 hours than you think you did. Youtube viewcounts update live until 302 to 308, and then they freeze for a few hours.<p>It'll update after 6 to 8 hours, but it still lags significantly behind real views. It only updates views every 8 hours or so after that, and it takes a few days for the displayed viewcount to catch up to the actual viewcount (We've had instances of videos with more thousands more likes than views... which is entertaining. :p)<p>One way you can sometimes get a more accurate view is by searching for your video. For some reason, the viewcount on the Youtube Search Results page is NOT linked to the viewcount displayed on the individual video page. It also lags behind, but it appears to update faster.",1347134340

The reason is that as the warm air rises, the Earths rotation creates a Coriolis effect.""<p>No. For a low-pressure system, the Coriolis effect arises from air moving toward the center of the system. The fact that warm air rises, although true, has no effect on the resulting rotation.<p>As air moves toward the center of a low-pressure system, it commences rotating, counterclockwise in the northern hemisphere -- classic Coriolis effect. In the same way, air moves away from the center of a high-pressure system, and commences rotating clockwise in the northern hemisphere.<p>The proof is that high-pressure systems also have warm air rising, but this doesn't cause a counterclockwise rotation.",1347134295

The presence of these cigarettes has also certainly led to fewer couch fires.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_safe_cigarette"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_safe_cigarette</a><p>It is unlikely that the entire 57 percent reduction in couch fires over 24 years is entirely due to the use of carcinogenic flame retardants.",1347134110

4493794,comment,4492991,4493355,2,0,bpatrianakos,,,"Changing definitions of the cloud? As far as I can tell the only definitions of the cloud that ever existed were basically:<p>1. On the Internet in a general sense. Somehow ""cloud"" became synonymous with Internet for many people and I can't figure out why. The weird part is that people who use ""cloud"" to mean Internet also use the term Internet to describe the same services the ""cloud"" offers. To me this makes me think marketing made this so. Somehow Dropbox is a cloud service but gmail (or hotmail or whatever email provider) is on the Internet according to many. How is that?<p>2. Definition 2 is basically the same as 1 but more specific. People use ""cloud"" to refer to anything connected to a server except you access the server through a service and all the specifics like hostnames and such are abstracted away. Like iCloud for Mac.<p>I just don't get all the fuss about the Cloud and I'm glad there's someone else out there that scoffs when they hear the term. How is Amazon EC2 ""in the cloud""? As far as I can tell its a VPS with some neat scaling features. How is Heroku and other app hosting services ""in the cloud""? Again, what I see is VPS hosting with even more abstraction on top of Amazon's abstraction.<p>Whenever I did freelance development work for people they'd ask if the hosting I offered was in the cloud. First off, why does that matter (well the people who ask for it claim it's better but can't explain why)? Second, what does that even mean? If it means will your site be hosted on a server connected to the Internet then yeah I suppose you can cal it the cloud.<p>About a year ago I noticed some copy on MediaTemple's page for either their (ve) or (dve) hosting offerings that say something to the effect of ""some people call it the cloud but we prefer to think of it as... (some very same logical explanation here)"". I was happy to see it because in the end, as far as I can tell there's no difference between the cloud and one or more servers accessible via the Internet.<p>Maybe to non-technical people having their information and data available across all devices by syncing with a remote server is novel and can only be understood by using the cloud metaphor. To them, the ""cloud"" is this vague thing on the internets that's all knowing and always available that's the next revolution in computing. To me it's just a client and server connecting and exchanging data. It's been there since I was a kid. The only difference is that now my phone, my car, and even my fridge can connect to it (for some strange reason) but its still just a damn server like we've had since before 56k modems.",1347133718

Let's say that instead of the standard wash process you use for regular cars, you take extra time on the Ferrari, using your best washers and new materials.

Sure you can still get around by finding an open one, and then going through the tunnels and passageways, but the friction is there. And there is no access from people who are not students. You can probably get in, but I don't think the university is encouraging it.<p>It is as hard as ever for students to take courses from other faculties, unless you are in engineering where it becomes somewhat easier. Still have to go through different people a number of times in order to get all the paperwork done.<p>And now we have a new dean of engineering. She's alright, nothing special. However one point where I am completely at odds with her is regarding Coursera type efforts at UW. When interviewed on her inauguration for the Iron Warrior, she stated that she did not want to get into the whole Coursera type courses, the reason being that there were plenty of other schools doing it, and they all had more resources and that the race was lost. Instead she's going to focus on professional development courses for graduates where she's interested in ""upgrading practicing engineers"", while later stating that only 30% of engineering graduates go on to engineering roles (the rest going in management). As only 30% work in engineering roles, I'd hazard a guess and say that the percentage of professional engineers is even lower.<p>I find her reasoning for not wanting to invest effort in open courses completely BS. There would be many more people who would find value in those than the professional engineers who will want to take more PDENG or WatPD courses. All those companies have just started, and they are at the very beginning. And the biggest mistake is the type of thinking where this is a competition between Waterloo and other universities.<p>I'm glad however that due to the IP rules of Waterloo, researchers and students maintain rights over anything they come up with. If that also applies to course materials developed by professors, it might be worthy to go around the administration and talk to professors directly. Though you would still have to deal with the university in the end, so as to publish the courses as being uWaterloo courses. Need to start looking into this.<p>To finish up this reply, that's already much longer than it needs to be, I think what the university needs is a President who's willing to cut the fat, and make the whole institution lean. Rumors are David Johnston, previous president of UW, had a plan to do just that before being offered his current role of current Governor General of Canada.",1347132795

If you had a kid, you know what it is - a newborn dying in his sleep for no apparent reason. You put a healthy baby to sleep in his bed only to find him dead in the morning. Fun stuff.<p>There are no exact explanation for the syndrome, but there are preventive measures (such as always let newborn fall asleep on his back) that statistically lessen the risk of it occurring.<p>One of the theories was that a typical crib mattress creates a fertile ground for some fungal growth. Coupled with chemicals found in the mattress, this creates weak poisonous gas emission, which ultimately kills the child. It's an older theory that was verified and formally considered invalid. <i>However</i> in one country, New Zealand, there's a doctor who has been a vigorously arguing in favor of this theory and now has a statistic to show that proper mattress wrapping nullifies the risk of SIDS. From what I've read, he had very hard time getting the authorities to even <i>listen</i> to his findings, leave alone to act on them.<p>I wish this lady the best of luck, she's got NYT on her side, I hope she takes a full advantage of this exposure.<p>[0] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudden_infant_death_syndrome"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudden_infant_death_syndrome</a>",1347131829

new platform. It can also be a lot faster to cross compile when the
target system is slow, but there is a well known drawback to using cross
compiling to speed up development times; you are not stressing the
target system, and hence, you've made target-specific bugs harder to
find.<p>Of course, there can be substantial costs from slowing down builds and
spending development time waiting for compilation on the actual (target)
hardware. On the other hand, the advantages of finding target-specific
bugs and adequately stressing the system can make the expense
worthwhile. Bad hardware happens far more often than vendors like to
admit, and stressing the system is a good way to test it.<p>As always, it's a trade-off.<p>The good example of taking the expensive but thorough approach is the
OpenBSD project. After getting past bootstrapping an new platform, all
builds are done on the actual (target) hardware. Since the code base is
cross platform, the new platform could give them the benefit of finding
bugs that don't manifest or are unnoticeable on all of the other
supported platforms. Also, the OpenBSD project does pretty much continuous
build of their tree on actual hardware, so they're always stressing
the hardware to make sure it's working properly, as well as finding
errant bugs that are tough to find on a single platform.",1347131464

I added a YMMV precisely because of the different situation - different impact reasons. My main point was:<p><pre><code>    Incumbent Sales Price SP1 = Cost of (Base + Risk + CYA-buffers) + Predetermined Margin
    Incumbent Profits     PR1 = SP1 - Total Actual Cost

    Startups Sales Price  SP2 = Cost of (Base + Risk) + Predetermined Margin
    Startups Profits      PR2 = SP2 - Total Actual Cost
</code></pre>
If you assume Cost of (Base + Risk) to be relatively on-par then SP1 > SP2 because SP1 includes CYA-buffers. The problem is that when incumbents become lean and shave off overhead, they can continue to command high prices due to entrenched contracts and make a much larger profits. This reinforces their position in the industry, making it harder for startups to compete.<p>Sidenote: While in a perfectly competitive market, the sales price should be determined by the intersection of supply and demand curves, instead of being a predetermined markup based on cost, in most contract manufacturing environments, all the costs are known, markups are expected, and thoroughly negotiated.",1347131339

4493663,comment,4490875,4492632,1,0,saraid216,,,"> I guess for example democracy provides a means to settle conflicts without (too much) violence.<p>Actually, it doesn't. A perfect monarchy is much better at settling conflicts than a perfect democracy. That's the appeal of the Benevolent Dictator approach: there's only one Decider and he Decides things and everyone is happy with his Decisions. It is a secularized faith system, with King Solomon deciding to cut babies in half to provide some Zen satori moment.<p>A democracy has no such mechanism. To the extent that we do (see our obsession with elections of public servants), it is a measure of its imperfection. The fact that we permit so much weight and meaning to go into who becomes POTUS or who becomes mayor or the the senator of New Mexico or whatever: these are indicators of the <i>weakness</i> of our democracy. They're fracture points.<p>> But it might have other problems, for example minorities will probably be disadvantaged. More able people will be exploited by the less able people, too.<p>One of the advantages of democracy is that egalitarianism (one of my values; as a liberal, I'm individualist, egalitarian, melioristic, and universalist) is <i>possible</i>. It's not possible in any other system we've come up with so far, not even an anarchistic lack of system. In an anarchy, government will naturally arise. In a non-democratic system, the government is necessarily in a power imbalance with the people.<p>Here's the thing. The greatest myth of my generation is that votes matter. Votes do not matter. A poignant scene? The Joker's ferry dilemma in <i>The Dark Knight</i>. The civilians voted. What did those votes matter? Votes are a way to excuse yourself from a democracy. They do serve a purpose, and that should be clear when you realize why they <i>don't</i> serve a purpose.<p>What is a democracy? It is the assumption that people are trustworthy. It is the system of government that assumes that the individual citizen is capable of giving respect to her fellow citizens, is intelligent and knowledgeable enough to comprehend possibilities of ""where to go from here"", and is compassionate enough to understand and wish the end of the plight of those who are less fortunate.<p>These assumptions are not true. This is why democracy has such difficulty: because it relies on the respect, intelligence, and empathy of citizens who simply have not been able to give it. There are reasons why they have not been able to, and arguments why they could, now and in the future, but that's about how to fix a democracy, not why we should have it to begin with. So I'll table that. Here's why:<p>A democracy says that <i>every</i> citizen <i>must</i> contribute to its governance. A government is, by its nature, a subset of the people. In a monarchy, the government is 1/N of the people. In a democracy, the government is N/N. In reality, this is a lot less simple: the monarchy needs a bureaucracy to which it delegates authority, and a democracy's population will never have 100% participation, not least because it's impossible to actually have 300 million individual people in your head. (Through this lens, the big government / small government debate becomes particularly insidious.)<p>A democracy says that you are a capable governor. That your voice should be at the table when policy discussions are had. If this isn't true, that's a failing of the education system, whose purpose is to provide useful adults who are capable of contributing to those policy discussions intelligently. That's a little chicken and egg, I'll admit, as is the fact that it's an infrastructure failing for you to (1) not be aware of the discussions, (2) capable of being present for the discussions, or (3) too busy making a living to join in.<p>These arguments shouldn't be a huge surprise. The concept of democracy is not terribly complicated. The difficulty comes in implementation, and in keeping the concept reasonably unpolluted from that implementation. The question of ""Why democracy?"" comes down to ""Can you trust your fellow citizen?"" Democracy relies on an affirmative answer. To the extent that you say no, the reasons for the negative are the things that need to be fixed: either the reason is wrong (""he's subhuman nigger; how can you trust him to make a good decision?"") or the reason is right (""he doesn't even understand that two is bigger than one; how can you trust him to make a good decision?""). Democracy's job is to transmute ""no""s to ""yes""s.<p>Strangely enough, yes: that does sound a lot like getting votes.<p>> I also think about tragedy of the commons type of problems, which a democracy should have an especially hard time of answering.<p>To put it shortly, that's what the rule of law is for.",1347130893

We all know <i>of</i> a few folks who did stay in to pursue a PhD, and the horror stories we heard were more than enough to keep us away. That, and now with all of us in hiring positions and seeing how little it buys in the job market (outside of very few milieus) has confirmed that we&#x27;d all rather go back for another Masters or even another Undergraduate degree than go for a PhD in our fields -- some of us already have.",1382713194

6611989,comment,6610649,6611067,1,0,memracom,,,"I don&#x27;t think that you are understanding it correctly. First it helps to understand some history. In the ancient voice telecoms networks of the 20th century there was the principle that &quot;he who dials the number pays the bill&quot;. Therefore, when a telecom provider (like DT) tried to connect a call with another telecom provider (such as BT in the UK), both telecoms companies knew that there was money flowing into DT&#x27;s pockets. So the recipient&#x27;s provider (in this case BT) wanted some of that money. This became a principle worldwide that interconnects between two networks had to be bought and paid for. Of course, calls went both directions over the interconnect so the concept of peering was born. What it meant was that the two companies would count up the calls at the end of the month, and the one with the most calls would pay the other company.<p>Then came US telecom deregulation, CLECS, the growth of the American-centric Internet, and a new way of making connections. On the Internet, one party opens a socket and superficially that seems to be similar to dialling a phone call. But the big difference is the the party opening a socket is not paying anyone a fee to do this. And they aren&#x27;t paying a per-minute fee for using the socket. In fact, the party opening the socket is paying money for the use of the whole network, and the party whose socket is being opened is also paying a fee for the whole socket. Thust the concept was born that interconnects should be free because they are a cost of doing business as an ISP.<p>And then began much confusion and strange business dealings as telecom management wrestled with how to reconcile these two worlds. The result was that deregulated US providers charged a lot less for interconnects, and the international telephone calls of the world started to take a detour through the USA. And internet connections did the same thing.<p>So basically, there should be no extra cost if Germany implements this. Some companies might get into arm-twisting battles if significant traffic flows shift from one circuit to another because they will likely need to upgrade some interconnects, but that is just a one time hit. It should not increase fees at all.",1382713117
6611988,comment,6611696,6611696,3,0,sivetic,,,"I finally pushed myself to bike to work this year, and up until this week managed to make my way to work 4-5 times a week using the bike.  Living a 10-15 minute bike ride away from work really encouraged me to try this year, and I&#x27;m glad I did.  I found it considerably more relaxing, even when riding in traffic, when compared to driving.
Unfortunately, living in the Great White North, it has gotten too cold in the morning to bike (or at least it has for me).  Temperatures are dipping below 0C, and I&#x27;m sure we will see snow soon enough.  Bike is on standby mode now until next April or May when the snow is finally gone.",1382713113

But if you worry about your switch failing, you have that worry if it&#x27;s not handling storage too, and you deal with it with redundancy. Moving the storage to hang off a switch does not change that - if you have a single switch and it fails, your servers are just as unavailable either way.<p>But hanging storage off your switches means it is possible to have servers take over drives of failing servers, which makes many other failure scenarios easier to handle.<p>In terms of pipes, yes, that is a concern for some uses. It won&#x27;t be fast unless you go to 10GE, and 10GE switches are still hopelessly overpriced. But &quot;most people&quot; do not serve up gigabits of content, and could do just fine with slower drives hanging off cheap 1Gbps switches.<p>I already assume not only that my drives will fail, but that the network and servers will fail too. Which means I need to replicate data over many servers on different networks. In that case having the drives be directly addressable over TCP/IP is not an added complexity, and it opens up so many opportunities in improving flexibility of server enclosures etc.",1382713029

Historically most fundamental science advances have come either from academia, or from big academia-like research organizations in industry (Bell Labs, Xerox PARC, Microsoft Research), or from government research labs (Sandia, Livermore, CERN, etc.). Most industry R&D tends towards different kinds of problems, applied research with 1-5 years commercialization horizons, sometimes pushing 10. That&#x27;s a valuable segment of research, but not all of it, and it depends on a pipeline of less-applied research to keep it fed.<p>But due to the difficulty of monetizing indirect future advances that basic science enables, it&#x27;s difficult to do it profitably in industry. A scientific discovery that at some point in the future turns out to be useful in developing technology is valuable for humanity, but you cannot easily capture that value, as it simply diffuses to the general benefit. Knowledge advances, but anyone can use it, and you don&#x27;t get to own it; you can get some kind of satisfaction in old age in looking at how this physics discovery you came up with in your 30s is being used to improve chip fabrication processes 40 years later, but you don&#x27;t get royalties on the chips.

Losing your staff, probably spending more on talent (you usually, not always, have to pay more to replace somebody), losing tons of institutional knowledge, basically having to rewrite everything from scratch (I find it interesting how on HN we simultaneously laud moving to CoolTech2000 and quote Joel on never rewriting existing software) switching development to something new that no one has experience with - well, those all have <i>huge</i> and long lasting costs.<p>Against that, we weren&#x27;t given a reason for the change. Maybe he was being nice and not exposing how things were. I&#x27;m certainly aware of dysfunctional teams that really need everything fixed, and there is little to do but wield the ax and get it done. But it is a heck of a gamble. These &quot;old timers&quot; - perhaps they were cranking out pretty good code at a good rate, on a stable system they understood, on time and budget, and so on, and had somebody come in, tell them they aren&#x27;t buzz word compliant, and enforce things on them that neither solve problems that they have nor really offers much of an advantage. Or, perhaps they were dinosaurs that took 3 months of arguments between 5 committees to decide whether to label a button &quot;reply&quot; or &quot;send&quot;. I dunno.<p>I&#x27;ve seen it both ways. I had a programmer react to my use of python as &quot;oh, that silly little language&quot;. Everything must be written in C and reinvented by him. Not a very useful attitude. OTOH, if I was to storm around and argue that our existing, well working c code should be converted to Scala for no particular reason, I&#x27;m being the unhelpful one.<p>tl;dr: I didn&#x27;t see anything in the article that made me think the existing team was doing it &#x27;wrong&#x27; to incur such risk and costs. I don&#x27;t much care if they are successful - the risk stands out like a sore thumb. We eviscerate the bankers that bet the company for their quarterly bonus by pursuing high risk, high reward strategies, and say &quot;cool&quot; when somebody throws out their team, source code, and institutional knowledge in favor of a cool new language and buzzwordy development process.",1382711991

I think it&#x27;s very sound, and I like it.<p>Second, I also agree with you that the DOM is available to the developer - however, if you go about blowing away and re-creating DOM elements that should have bindings on them (for example), you&#x27;re going to have a bad time.  This was something counterintuitive to our Frontend developers.  In situations where you want to create or remove DOM elements with Knockout bindings, you really should be using Knockout&#x27;s bindings (or your own custom Knockout bindings) itself to do it, otherwise you&#x27;re working pretty hard against the grain.  I don&#x27;t personally see a problem with that - so I agree with you that the DOM is available for change - but that was hard to sell to others.  :shrug: maybe I&#x27;m just a bad salesman.<p>EDIT: Ah, I think I can see why you feel this way.  I should put the counterpoints I put above in quotes, as they don&#x27;t actually reflect how I feel.  I can see how someone skimming would think I actually believe them to be true.  I personally have a very favorable opinion of Knockout.  I can, however, see why it&#x27;s a hard sell for some frontend developers.  I can&#x27;t blame them for feeling that way given their points above, though I would like to believe that I can win them over with my counterpoints to it over time.

Without artificial fertilizers produced with this process it would be impossible to support a human population of more than 4 billion people even if every bit of arable land were being farmed to maximum capacity.<p>The Haber-Bosch process broke through the hard limit of how much plant protein could be produced through agriculture and led directly to the population explosion started in the 19th century.<p>Paraphrasing Vaclav Smil&#x27;s arguments:<p>Naturally-produced fertilizers can provide approximately 200 kg. of nitrogen per hectare annually; this allows for the production of between 200 and 250 kg. of plant proteins. This places a theoretical limit on the number of people that each hectare of land could sustain.

In academia you have fewer resources and have to bring in your own grants, but the resource constraint is the main constraint, a sort of indirect restriction on your research freedom (how strong of one depends on your resource needs). Lots of other differences depending on your preferences. Easier to publish papers in academia (no approval needed and it&#x27;s valued); easier to do software development in industry (resources/coordination exists, and it&#x27;s valued).

6611788,comment,6610772,6610772,23,0,EdgarVerona,,,"Having worked with Knockout on a fairly large project, I personally liked it as a normally server-side developer - however, it got mixed reviews from our purely frontend developers.<p>For me, there are several things I like about Knockout as someone who&#x27;s not a primarily frontend developer:<p>1) Obviousness of purpose.  The thing I hate the most about frontend development is the lack of visibility into what is actually bound to an object.  When I run into UI code that&#x27;s not using some kind of framework like Knockout, inevitably the UI interactions are typically performed with jQuery bindings, and often they aren&#x27;t terribly straightforward to find for anyone who didn&#x27;t initially develop it (&quot;what, you bound a mouseover action to everything that fits &#x27;.mouseoverable > li > ul > li > .mousey&#x27;?&quot;)<p>2) Clearly defined interaction models.  I like creating and populating the ViewModel, and thus having a very clear place in the Javascript where I know the business logic and data for the frontend are going to live.  When I create the ViewModel as its own Javascript object, I can define the full contract of what data the application needs and what operations can be done against it in a manner that I can quickly locate and fix up later.<p>3) Syncing of frontend state with data state.  (of course, this is an obvious benefit, but...)  I love that, once I&#x27;ve defined these obvious bindings, I can then focus more on my model and less on what is bound to that model.  It gives me the ability to separate out my concerns, at least more than a scattering of one-off jQuery bindings would.<p>Knockout provides an obviousness of binding not only because  all interactions between the UI, the user, and the model are supposed to happen through these bindings, but because the bindings are supposed to live on the element being interacted with/displayed itself.  This made a huge difference for me, as someone who likes to see an obvious relationship between the view and the underlying logic that&#x27;s modifying or creating that view.  The concept of observable properties also felt natural to me, and I didn&#x27;t mind taking the time to make rich ViewModel objects that had methods attached to them representing actions, and &quot;ko.computed&quot;s when I had more complex scenarios in which I wanted to watch for (or perform) an update.<p>However, our frontend guys hated it, and I can understand why they feel that way (though I disagree with them on many of these points, and would like to win them over).  For them:<p>1) &quot;We&#x27;re moving backwards.&quot; It&#x27;s a dramatically different approach that feels counterintuitive - in fact, for frontend developers who&#x27;ve been told their entire career to never put event handlers on the attributes of an element itself, it feels like a step backward evolutionarily.  It feels, to them, like you might as well be going back to &quot;onclick=&#x27;&#x27;&quot; bindings.<p>2) &quot;More upfront work.&quot;  It&#x27;s a more upfront work to create and maintain solid and coherent ViewModel objects, particularly when Knockout provides the tempting - but often fragile - alternative of calling &quot;ko.mapping.fromJSON&quot; or &quot;ko.mapping.fromJS&quot; that will essentially make a dumb ViewModel for you, but will also make everything observable and won&#x27;t give you any of the benefits of creating your own ViewModel with reasonable business logic, computeds, etc... This not only ends up making the bindings feel messy as they start performing complex logic directly in the binding where a computed or method would do, but it reinforces that bad &quot;onclick=&quot; binding feeling that they hate.<p>3) &quot;We have to surrender control of the DOM.&quot; The real killer for them is that, once the DOM is being managed by Knockout, you essentially have to give your control of the DOM over to Knockout.  If you start fiddling with DOM elements with your own custom jQuery handlers instead of through custom (or built in) bindings, Knockout is going to inevitably run over your changes in unexpected ways as it itself modifies the DOM.  Asking the frontend developers to make custom bindings is, unfortunately, asking for more work (and less intuitive work) than just making a jQuery binding, and thus it presents itself as a lot of additional code.<p>4) &quot;The path for mixing &#x27;common&#x27; ViewModels with &#x27;page specific&#x27; ViewModels is not clear.&quot;  This is one I still struggle with in trying to help find a clear path for them.  Let&#x27;s say that a page loads with a bunch of sections that are common to every page, and there are also page specific data and operations that need to be loaded.  Knockout only lets you bind one ViewModel object to a given set of DOM elements at a time, which makes this difficult.  My gut is that, if we were to create these ViewModel objects in such a way that a common &quot;binding&quot; Javascript block of code - run after all ViewModel objects for the page were both created and combined into a single over-arching object - existed, then they could all live together.  This solution is fragile, however - that means every binding would need to be bound to some object off of that single ViewModel object, which could be prone to breakage as these models change.  Essentially, bindings (or DOM elements with appropriate &quot;with:&quot; bindings to scope out what part of that larger ViewModel you cared about) would have to be created with this larger overall ViewModel in mind.  The proposals don&#x27;t sound great when I talk to people about them, and I can understand their hesitation.  (if any of you have good alternatives, I&#x27;d love to hear them)<p>5) &quot;We dislike having &#x27;logic bindings&#x27; or &#x27;placeholder bindings&#x27;.&quot;  Frequently, the data for the ViewModel isn&#x27;t actually loaded yet by the time you need to bind.  The way of preventing the bindings that require that data from breaking is to have boundary bindings wrapping them, such as checking if the object is loaded or the data you want isn&#x27;t null... but now you&#x27;ve got essentially boundary checks sitting in the DOM.  They dislike those - understandably - and they dislike &quot;with&quot; bindings as well.  It all feels like fluff that they shouldn&#x27;t have to worry about, and that crowds up the view.  This is another one for which I don&#x27;t have a good response or alternative.<p>Anyways, Knockout definitely has both good and bad elements to it.  I encourage everyone to give it a try.  You may love it - as I do - despite its flaws, or you may hate it!  But give it a shot, it may be a handy tool for you.",1382711255

There will be just no structuring, anyone can share whatever they know, you can have any content on any board - the reality is that these platforms are no better than following lots and lots of twitter feeds and blogs and trying to learn about a topic.

6611655,comment,6610593,6611378,10,0,bad_user,,,"Joda&#x27;s impression of Scala is very insightful and it shows that Joda is an awesome engineer. But first of all, Joda was also careful to explain in his second post (the one that was meant to go public) that Scala didn&#x27;t work in their <i>own freaking context</i> and that all platforms suck depending on perspective.<p>Let me address some of the points raised ...<p>(1) Scala is difficult for Java developers to learn, because Scala has new concepts in it, like type-classes or monads and these concepts are exposed within a <i>static type system</i>. Are these concepts useful? After using Scala for the last 2 years, I can bet my life on it. However there&#x27;s a learning curve involved and Scala is definitely more expensive to learn than Java. That&#x27;s why context matters. If a company has the resources to invest in this learning curve, then it&#x27;s worth it, otherwise it isn&#x27;t.<p>(2) Scala is not complex as Joda mentions. Not in the original sense of the word &quot;complex&quot;. Scala is in fact pretty simple, as the features exposed are pretty well thought and orthogonal. But those features are powerful. The real complexity comes from its interactions with the JVM, as they had to do some compromises. It&#x27;s important however to differentiate &quot;easy&quot; versus &quot;simple&quot;. See this awesome talk by Rich Hickey ... <a href=""http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy</a><p>(3) As any new community, the Scala community started by doing lots of experiments, pushing its syntax and its type-system to its limits, going as far as to use features that aren&#x27;t fully baked yet. This happens with languages that try new techniques. But as the community is maturing, those problematic edge cases get flushed out and there are fewer and fewer libraries that go nuts, as more and better best practices emerge.<p>The favorite example of Scala bashers is the Dispatcher library, that originally went nuts over operator overloading, but that was rewritten [1] and these days Scala libraries are actually quite sane and elegant.<p>Also, there&#x27;s nothing wrong with the existence of experimental libraries, like Scalaz. Contrary to public opinion, it&#x27;s not in wide usage in Scala projects, it&#x27;s very useful for people that need it and such projects end up exposing weaknesses and pushing the language forward. The existence of libraries like Scalaz is a virtue and really, people work on whatever they God-damn please, you can&#x27;t blame a whole community for it. Joda used it as an example for the dramatic effect, in a private email, OK?<p>(4) SBT&#x27;s syntax looks awful until you get the hang of it, because it uses operator overloading to achieve a declarative syntax for building an immutable data-structure that describes the build process. This syntax will likely get fixed, but it&#x27;s also a really pragmatic tool and I now use SBT even for Java projects and I miss it when working with Python/Ruby. There&#x27;s also a Maven plugin as an alternative and Joda mentions the stalled Maven plugin and its lack of support for incremental compilation, however that&#x27;s no longer true.<p>(5) Joda mentioned problems with the upgrade cycle. Scala 2.8 should have been in fact called Scala 3.0, as the changes in it were dramatic, which is why when Joda wrote that email, many companies were still on 2.7 and the upgrade to 2.9 scared the shit out of people. However, things are a lot better these days. Minor versions no longer introduce backwards compatibility issues, so if you&#x27;re using 2.10.3, then you won&#x27;t have any problems with libraries compiled for 2.10.x and you can even use many libraries compiled for 2.9. It&#x27;s much more stable.<p>In regards to why is backwards compatibility affected by new versions, well it happens because the standard library hasn&#x27;t stagnated. Java has awful pieces of junk in its standard library that were never pulled out or redesigned, but as a new and still growing language, Scala cannot afford to freeze its standard library. And we are not talking about major changes here, just a simple addition of a method to a base interface can trigger the necessity for recompilation.<p>But these days there are a lot of useful libraries with multiple contributers and that get compiled for newer Scala versions as soon as those versions come out. And personally I haven&#x27;t bumped into problems because of it, as upgrades for the stack we&#x27;ve been using have been really smooth.<p>(6) At my old startup, we&#x27;ve built a web service that was able to handle 30,000 requests per second, with responses being processed in under 10ms on average, using only 10 EC2 h1.medium instances. Actually we started by running that code on 10 Heroku dynos, but then moved to AWS for more control. And the code was written largely in a functional style, using Scala&#x27;s standard immutable data-structures all over the place. People that complain about performance degradation do have a point in the proper context, but people that bitch about it based on other people&#x27;s opinions or based on silly benchmarks, well such people don&#x27;t know what they are talking about, especially since immutable data-structures help a lot with multi-threading woes, giving you room to efficiently use the resources available.<p>Actually, I think Joda&#x27;s actions of eliminating Scala&#x27;s data-structures or closures from the whole codebase, were excessive (and I&#x27;m trying hard not to say silly).<p>(7) It&#x27;s all about the libraries. If every library you&#x27;re using is a Java library like Joda mentioned they did (as Scala makes usage of Java libraries easy), then you might as well use Java as a language. But if you&#x27;re using Scala&#x27;s strengths  and libraries built with Scala, with a Scala-ish interface and you like those libraries (e.g. Play, Akka), then Scala suddenly becomes inexpensible.<p>(8) Stephen Colebourne, for all his talent, is a douche-bag.<p>[1] <a href=""http://code.technically.us/post/54293186930/scala-in-2007-2013"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.technically.us/post/54293186930/scala-in-2007-20...</a>",1382710078

I&#x27;ve spent at least as much time building custom RPM/DEB packages, finding PPAs, etc. for things which don&#x27;t compile cleanly on a particular Linux distribution. That&#x27;s just a cost of using bleeding-edge or obscure packages: the right lesson to draw is to avoid taking on the cost of using less stable packages unless you gain significant benefit.<p>> Vagrant boxes also are platform independent if he had a vagrant development env, he wouldn&#x27;t have to blog about how to install python<p>He didn&#x27;t  that&#x27;s a local cost he chose to take on for perceived benefits but it&#x27;s neither necessary not advisable if you don&#x27;t need something other than the system installed Python (2.5-2.7). This is exactly the same situation as on a Linux distribution.<p>> You certainly can install all pythons that your projects use side-by-side, but this quickly turns into a mess when you have multiple projects that deploy on different target systems, maybe with different sets of libraries etc.<p>This is a platform-neutral problem which has been well solved for many years using Virtualenv:<p><a href=""http://www.virtualenv.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.virtualenv.org/</a><p>> All in all: It&#x27;s cleaner, less work and more flexible.<p>What you described is a LOT more work and adds significant performance and usability overhead to things you do many times a day, particularly if you need to work on more than one project and spend time  spinning Vagrant instances up and down, installing updates, etc. rather than doing something productive.<p>It might still be worth it if you really need to test your deployment process all the time but otherwise that cost adds up. Personally, running locally and testing on EC2 has been much easier, faster, and makes my testing realistic by using the actual real production infrastructure rather than a facsimile crammed onto one laptop.",1382709964

They <i>lied</i> to you. They intentionally told you that they could not view your files when in fact they can. If that's not enough, they had a critical security vulnerability (log in with no password) for four hours, proving that their systems fail open. Finally, if all this wasn't bad enough yet, they do not encrypt your files when they store them[1].<p>[1] <i>Technically</i> they do encrypt the files, but the keys are right next to them on the same infrastructure.

A one cent per-share transfer tax doesn't mean Wall Street is out of business. It means you won't have enough money in your 401k to retire.""<p>While I agree with the rest of your criticisms, this is off base. You have to consider the second-order effects; banks will not simply continue to trade at the exact same volume as before whatever (presumably somehow fixed-up) tax is imposed, then pass the costs on to hapless consumers who have no choice but to just fork over the cash. They will have to trade less. Which is the point; however good or bad it may be, at least the core idea is making some account of second-order effects. When you tax a thing, you get less of it.<p>(My specific opinion is that it isn't necessarily a net gain as written, it is after all just an HN comment, but that the general idea of carefully re-inserting some friction back into the market as a damping factor may be a useful line of inquiry. But it's not going to be easy.)",1312858695

And its just going to get worse over time.<p>What I would love is an app that would analyze my library, eliminate exact dups, and backup automatically to each drive when I plug them in.  Kind of like iPhone sync but from devices->comp->external storage.  Super Bonus Points if it can auto-level pics.<p>But the biggest time sink is winnowing down the raw photos to a best-of list suitable to upload to an online photo sharing site.  Usually we take 4 or 5 pics that are all about the same and then have to go through each 'group' and pick the best.  Having so many usually means we just skip it and store them all for later.  But that's really just delaying the pain, someday when we want to show them off its really gonna hurt.  Its generally more important to me to get an OK pic that conveys the idea of the 'memory' rather than spending the extra time to pick the absolutely best shot.<p>Fancy algo's to the rescue?",1312857764

But the thing that holds me back are a) fear of getting in trouble and b) my conscience.  My mom brought me up with a very strict sense of right and wrong and that still stays with me.  From what I have read and experienced of inner city culture, its the parenting (or lack thereof) and the failure to instill a conscience that makes rioting more common in these communities.  Another factor is that the media and/or educational system and/or community culture have generally built up a sense of grievance and entitlement.  That sense of grievance gives an excuse to act out, and a rationalization that assuages the conscience.  These grievances may be real or not, but the destruction is still completely unjustified, because its certainly not the hard working storekeeper who's shop is getting burned who is responsible for whatever grievances the rioter might have had.",1312856682

But your states and stages are a bit strange!<p>Much of why we use dynamic programming is that the work at stage i needs only the work at stage i + 1 (for the backward iterations), and here in some problems we can get some huge savings in computing.  Also this 'framework' does well handling uncertainty.<p>Yes, the usual way is to do find the solution from the end and then use it starting at the beginning.  In the code I posted on this thread, I found the solution starting at the beginning and then used it by starting at the end and then printed out the words in the reverse order in which I found them.",1312856538

I don't see accreditation of engineering programs as proof that software engineering is a legitimate field of engineering.<p>The problem for me is that there don't seem to be any basic principles of software construction. Most programs just teach a selection of software development fad methodologies. A decade ago, most programs taught some variation of waterfall development. Now they tend to teach some variation of agile development. As far as I can tell, there's no scholarship to support one method over the other - it's pure fashion and industry demand. (The decline of academic research on software construction methods since the 80s is another problem) Look at software engineering programs in another ten years and I'm sure you'll see a different mix of classes emphasizing the business trends of the day.<p>In comparison, you could look at the curriculum for almost any electrical engineering program from thirty years ago and you would see almost the same classes as a modern program: circuit theory, E&M, electric machines, control, communication systems, etc. The only significant difference would be the addition of courses on software and digital electronics.",1312856190

Google getting outbid on the Nortel suite and their subsequent claims that implied they only pursued the portfolio for the benefit of OSS kept it alive.<p>On a meta level, the patent issue is so interesting  because it creates such internal contradictions for the libertarians who comprise a significant fraction of vocal HN'ers.

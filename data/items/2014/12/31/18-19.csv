However this is comical:\n&quot;...in which he describes the rejection by the journal Nature of an obituary he was asked to write&quot;\nI mean, who in their right mind rejects an obit that they asked someone to write? The power that the Nature editors wield is awesome in the ivory tower, and it has gone to their heads.<p>That said, I was a mathy undergrad and now am in a neuro PhD program. The gulf is large indeed. I think the largest difference for me is the relation to science in general. As a mathy person, we are all about the predictive powers of science. I do A, then B happens at time T. In bio, it is not that at all. Bio is an observational science. I see A, then I see B at time T. Sure, you can make predictions, but what these events all have to do with each other is almost impossible to predict in a living organism/environment. As such, when bio people hear Partial Differential Equation, they go running for the hills.<p>Case in point, PDEs are no big deal for me, I took an entire class on them. But in one class we had to <i>read</i> a paper on using PDEs to model genetic interactions with a sugar input and then write up 1 single page on it (with some guidelines). Oh man, the riot! 59 of the other people in the class were up in arms about this. They tried to get the points on the paper halved, then eliminated, then the teacher to rescind the assignment, which they were all successful in doing. Then the non-stop complaining ensued for weeks in the halls. All because we had to read a paper with PDEs written out in it. My lord.<p>On the plus side, it leaves a huge hole that none of the bio people want to crawl down. This is a positive for mathy people, as the bio is ore memorization than anything. The bio field is rocking and rolling already from the intrusion that mathy people are mediating. Now, if your lab does not have a CS major in it, you are going to fall behind. The idea that quants and big data people are necessary is just starting to grab hold of the bio world. Now is a good time to get into grad school in the bio field if you have a math background as they are just now starting to realize they need you. It&#x27;s just hard to get through classes though.",1420052291

Basically, set a schedule saying Tuesday and Friday you are doing Sales, demo&#x27;s and client followup.  And then the rest of the week you work on product. Or reverse it if the needs are reversed.  But you get the idea.  Of course, when you do that it doesn&#x27;t mean you ignore calls/emails.  Instead you immediately respond and schedule time on the next day/time available and in that followup make sure you aren&#x27;t missing an immediate issue or hot prospect.  Use your calendar of choice and just schedule yourself in detail.<p>Like I said, I am doing this (again) and it is helping me refocus a lot, but in fairness I sometimes struggle still putting off a demo until another day so I catch myself sometimes doing a &quot;quick&quot; demo or talking to prospects when I should be finishing something.  Every time I do a non-critical (e.g. service is not down) activity out of turn,  I wind up kicking myself later because rarely is the case where it has led to a sale or where it was something that could not wait 1-2 days while I finished what I was in the middle of.<p>As for sales, I think if you haven&#x27;t already you really need to identify how people find you and how you get them to signup.  If this process is primarily human, that is a key if not primary place to focus a lot of your efforts.  Signup and on-boarding need to be automatic as does the ability for a person that hits the marketing site to understand the products value proposition. Small quick video(s) and image walk-thru&#x27;s help from what I have seen.  It doesn&#x27;t mean you stop being human and talking to everyone on the planet that will listen, just that you need the research and on-boarding process as smooth as possible so that you don&#x27;t get overloaded doing work a computer should.",1420052248

I&#x27;ve dedicated my life to technology and building products that can help people. I&#x27;m relatively smart and really hardworking. My success thus far has been modest, though I have been able to raise funding from a prestigious VC firm. My standards are high so I do not consider fundraising any kind of success. I also detest self promotion and so I have not announced the fundraise. My startup feels like it has just recently found product market fit but I&#x27;m not sure. Either way I will go for it. The problem is everytime i try to hone in on myself and focus on my goals I hear about someone I know or someone &quot;like me&quot; (i.e. they have similar attributes, aren&#x27;t friends but are in my peer group, and are working on a similar idea or an idea i&#x27;ve had in the past) whose raised a bunch of money and is all over the press and in some cases has achieved real success. I have this negative feeling for hours, days sometimes that I can only assume is jealousy. Perhaps because I am competitive. Perhaps because in addition to wanting to build products and help people, I am human and I want to be the &quot;first&quot; or the &quot;best&quot; in my peer group. I don&#x27;t like feeling this feeling though because I know that I genuinely wish this people well and that if i myself were successful I wouldn&#x27;t feel this way...or maybe I would? I&#x27;d love your help and advice on how I can do away with this feeling and focus on being a world class entrepreneur. I am not OK with being OK with failure and I do not accept being mediocre, but there has to be a way of being competitive in a healthy way without having to unfollow every stream of social media from peers that succeed and without having to feel envious of others.

Some obvious, many not. I am not an expert in Python, nor am I an expert in auditing secure RSA implementations. Neither are most of this project&#x27;s intended audience, I would warrant.<p>Using RSA like this directly, in my opinion, dramatically increases the likelihood of a significant implementation oversight when compared to something as widely-used, audited, and established as GPG. And it <i>should</i> cause security-conscious users to be much more distrustful of it.<p>As a security professional, adding to the list of libraries and crypto implementations for me to audit does not reduce my workload: it massively increases it. If it were a conceptually simple wrapper around GPG, I would consider deploying it without a second thought. GPG, while crusty and imperfect, is at least more difficult to misuse. As it stands, I would need to spend significant time relearning RSA implementation best practices and ensuring it adheres to them.<p>The fact that others aren&#x27;t likely to do (or be capable of doing) this legwork only makes the problem worse; bad crypto is often little better than no crypto.

Now put the semantics of that sentence in your hat and reevaluate the entire test and the concepts that went into the test. Think about it from a pedagogical standpoint.<p>We&#x27;re adults, we&#x27;ve been through school. We can make some assumptions. We can guess that a &quot;subtraction story&quot; like in #9 is supposed to be an explanation of the algebra problem (in 1st grade) 8 - ___ = 2.<p>Something like &quot;I had 8 problems, but got 6 answers wrong. I only got 2 right.&quot;<p>We can establish that a subtraction story is tied to the concept of subtraction which is indicated with this symbol &#x27;-&#x27;. (I&#x27;m not going to address the picture).<p>We know, because we&#x27;re smart 1st graders, that a story is made up of sentences. So a subtraction story, must be made up of subtraction sentences. And we know from concepts like the ones that built up to #9 that &#x27;-&#x27; is the symbol for subtraction and there&#x27;s some kind of concept that an equation like 8-6=2 must be a subtraction sentence written with symbols and not words. Though this equivalence isn&#x27;t easy for kids to get, which is why word problems are always so hard in maths pedagogy. But let&#x27;s say I&#x27;m sharp and I get that.<p>Now reassess #12. The obvious related subtraction sentence, written with symbols, should be something like 7-3=4 or 7-4=3 (there&#x27;s no context to let us know what we&#x27;re subtracting from the lego diagram, so either answer should be correct). But we look down at the answers, and there&#x27;s no &#x27;-&#x27; sign! In desperation we circle &#x27;c&#x27; because it has all the right numbers, even if it doesn&#x27;t make any sense conceptually...none of the other answers have numbers we can fit into the picture.<p>Now absurdly this is marked correct! Whew, my grade is saved. But my concept is broken. Subtraction sentences do <i>not</i> feature the symbol &#x27;-&#x27;, they feature the symbol &#x27;+&#x27;. I&#x27;m 6, and I&#x27;m just being introduced to this, so what am I to think? Subtraction stories use &#x27;-&#x27; but subtraction sentences use &#x27;+&#x27;...<i>even though stories are made up of sentences</i>. So either my English class is wrong, or Math is wrong...<p>But wait. #6 uses &quot;subtraction sentence&quot; also, but the correct answer used a &#x27;-&#x27;! Now what am I supposed to think? We know what a number sentence is. We know what a subtraction story is. But we have no clue what a subtraction sentence is and the concept for what it is is utterly lost. Now instead of learning about subtraction, I&#x27;m an extremely frustrated 6 year old who gets through tests by random guessing instead of learning.<p>This isn&#x27;t a bad exam, this is terribly pedagogy. As a former professional educator, my assessment is that this is the work of idiots who were purposely trying to sabotage 1st grade math education.<p>Here&#x27;s what I think of #1 <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8820195"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8820195</a><p>By topic #2, in <i>1st grade</i> we&#x27;ve utterly and completely failed every child who took this test.

8820322,comment,8819115,8820234,0,0,staltz,,,"I use a simple example of how Rx (not FRP, that&#x27;s something completely different) benefits in programming: the traditional use case of analytics events is to spread Analytics.sendEvent() calls in many places of your codebase. Using Rx to solve this problem, things get inverted: you have all analytics events defined in one module, they are listening to events happening throughout the codebase. Sometimes the platform (mobile or whatnot, think beyond JS) provides convenient lifecycle events for this. In conclusion: the only place you see analytics events in your codebase is in the Analytics module.<p>To me, it&#x27;s about separation of concerns most of the times, and about handy event operators sometimes (e.g. <a href=""https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS/blob/master/doc/api/core/operators/debounce.md"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS/blob/master/doc/...</a>).",1420049034

Unless you meant to say, &quot;climate control&quot; instead of space heating, this is just not true.  You can&#x27;t just take the &quot;average&quot; of what people use energy for in a country like the US, and expect it to be close to true for everyone.<p>For those of us living in the South, Southwest US (it was 65 and sunny here on Christmas day), energy usage is much higher for air-conditioning than for heating, and you can&#x27;t just take a passive solar system and expect it to cool your house down.<p>Yes, passive solar heating can be great for some people, but not for everyone.

Think children in the garage.<p>Without thinking too hard the first thing that comes to mind is something like the contact rods that electric trams use.  These could come out of the top or bottom of the car and make contact with suitably designed safe power delivery system.<p>Another option would be something like the jacks used to lift Formula 1 cars during pit stops.<p>Yet another would be a &quot;docking station&quot; you literally drive into, with contacts that connect through the front of the car. With self-driving Teslas this could be symbiotic.<p>Finally, something like the rig used to refuel jets in flight (probably too complex but I thought I throw it on the table).<p>I could also see something like a one meter diameter coil assembly that normally lays flat on the ground.  When the car parks on top of it the motorized assembly comes up and couples with a matching coil on the bottom of the car for power transfer without exposed high voltage connectors.<p>In the end I go back to: how hard is it to plug in a cord?

8820305,comment,8818870,8819270,0,0,pierrec,,,"I agree that space is often lost in modern productions of some genres, mainly folk music. In most other cases however, I&#x27;d say loss of space doesn&#x27;t happen all that much, or isn&#x27;t a concern. With the most common cases I can think of being:<p>- You&#x27;re working in a genre that involves lots of electronic sounds, and space is something that you can go crazy with. Effects that spatialize sound realistically are routinely used and abused by electronic artists. Rock music is also generally mixed with very aggressive panning and spatial effects - it&#x27;s just cooler that tame realism.<p>- In the case of soundtracks, mockups might be used instead of getting the music performed. All the good orchestral samplebanks provide a unified sense of space, giving you the choice of mixing near/far mics for example. You might loose some sense of space by mixing different samplebanks, but that&#x27;s nothing compared to the loss of realism in expressive performance that you&#x27;ll get anyways.<p>- In the case of classical music, recording is usually done in a proper, old-school, realistic fashion.",1420048839

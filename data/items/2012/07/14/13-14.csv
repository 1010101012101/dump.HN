You can already see a number of improvements Apple has made to iOS as a result of Android, and a strong Android OS will continue to keep them on their toes.<p>2) You have to wonder if it is even good for Apple to win in the long run. They have so much control over the iPhone ecosystem, getting too much market share in the mobile/tablet space would very likely garner unwanted attention from the DOJ. It is possible Android is a significant buffer against an anti-trust action similar to what Microsoft saw in the 90's.",1342274399

Because they did not have to spend resources on the same development and market testing, it stands to reason that the copy product could also be sold much more cheaply than the original, giving the competitive product a significant cost advantage (or giving the company creating the product a higher profit margin, or both).<p>I'm not saying anything specific about Apple or Samsung in this case, but product superiority alone is rarely the competition killer you appear to make it out to be.",1342274375

This almost certainly has bottom line benefits for Apple.<p>Courtrooms and patents are just another tool big corporations use to compete. Apple is particularly aggressive as is Microsoft but many companies do this. Motorola comes to mind and Nokia as well.<p>This needs to be fixed at the congressional level but good luck with that.

All of these fad diets basically trick the dieter into eating less calories.  When Lustig, etc... cite various studies those studies never seem to account for overall caloric intake.  Person A cut carbs, person B didn't, person A lost weight ergo carbs are bad.  Yeah, it doesn't quite work that way.  Saying that cutting calories will help a person lose weight doesn't sell books so authors have to pick something to demonize.<p>HFCS is a popular thing to demonize now.  Is it surprising to anyone that if a person cuts out 4-6 sodas/day that had ~200 calories each that said person is going to lose weight?

Especially in this context, since it's basically calorie restriction designed to appeal to an engineer.<p>Personally, I lost 50 pounds using this approach, and my diet consisted mainly of Hot Pockets, microwaved White Castle cheeseburgers, and frozen pizza.  Because they print the number of calories on the back of the box, it made it easier to control calories in.  I didn't exercise and as a programmer spent most of my day sitting in a chair.  Yet it was relatively straightforward to lose weight by simply eating less, with no particular regard to the composition of what was eaten.<p>My personal opinion is that all diets ""work"".  Regardless of the magic or science involved, people on diets who have actually adopted the ""I'm seriously trying to lose weight"" mindset will eat fewer calories.  Especially when it starts working: The Hacker's Diet involves a daily weight log and some math to extract the trend line from the noise.  Now that we have WiFi scales and fit-tracking web sites, it's very easy to monitor the effect of cutting out soda, skipping dessert, and not having seconds at the dragon buffet.<p>Our brains are wired to make connections, and to some extent, to evangelize.  So if you lose weight on the Tofu Diet, you're likely to go around telling everyone about the miracle benefits of tofu.  Much like I'm convinced a simple calories-in/calories-out approach is all you need.",1342272089

It is being said that this specific, narrow, limited group of men is using the structures they created to keep articles that focus on their interests, Linux distributions, while excluding things that interest other people and not them, like bridal gowns.  Because of the demographics of that population, the interests happen to fall along gendered lines.<p>Almost no one is interested in Linux distributions, but having articles on them doesn't somehow discourage any women from contributing and may encourage those who are into Linux.  However, it does when topics that are socially coded as feminine, such as wedding dresses, are deleted because of their topic it does send a message about what is valued by the community.<p>Those social codings are also a problem, but a different problem than the one being discussed here.  The best way to fix that underlying issue in this particular case would be for more men learn about the history of fashion and get interested in the construction of garments, rather than seeing clothes as trivial or beneath notice.  In the absence of that change, the next best thing would be for these particular men to be aware of their bias and let other people talk about the importance of clothing even if they don't agree.",1342271838

G4S on the other hand is a company whose business plan is to sell 'security theatre'. They hire and train people for the minimum amount possible and resell that for the maximum amount possible, they don't have any incentive to care about their employees. They are just a HR department that processes people applying for and leaving jobs as efficiently as possible and a sales department that sells that time. No one is going to take pride in their work for a company like this. Maybe they made a mistake in assuming that there were an enough desperate unemployed people available to fill these positions?<p>I think that successful organisations, whether they be state run or private companies, depend massively on the character of the individuals that run them. I expect that Space X is successful because Elon Musk is a very rewarding person to work for. And for an example of a state run organisation like this see Frank Pick[1] who, as manager of London Transport, untangled the mess of privately constructed transport systems and made it into the poster child for public transport systems across the world. Pick's organisational values and culture outlasted him for many years, even today new transport projects in London have to be pretty high quality because they are measured against the legacy of all the great stuff the was designed and built in the 40's and 50's.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Pick"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Pick</a>",1342271146

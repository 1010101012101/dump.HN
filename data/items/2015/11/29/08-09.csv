All the synchronizing between the cores happen at L3 cache layer and QPI, because caches are inclusive and L3 is common to all cores. When a core writes to L3, it invalidates the same cache line in L1 and L2 caches of other cores. Therefore if your cores write to the same cache line, you have a big problem regardless of the chosen memory order model.",1448787380

When a company is shipping at a large scale (~80 million devices a year), macro factors must be playing a role -- may be the # of phones shipped in the Chinese market is lower this year than expected?, or slowdown in consumer spending? or some other macro factor. The reason I say this is because the thesis presented in the article (&quot;No Loyalty&quot;) isn&#x27;t well substantiated. There are way too many counter anecdotes available where super loyal &#x27;mi-fans&#x27; (thats what the loyal fans of this company are called) have stood in line for hours to purchase the latest phones (a la Apple).<p>Their growth has been quite phenomenal -- infact, they are probably the fastest company to reach $1B in revenue <i>ever</i> -- which isn&#x27;t a small feat. But as size grows, doesn&#x27;t growth inevitably slow down (for almost every company)?<p>Also, as another commenter has pointed out, they really are a <i>internet of things</i> company, more than a smartphone company.

Are debt collectors disproportionately ignoring bad debts owed by white people? Why would they do that - white supremacy is somehow overriding profit motive?<p>This is a very odd question for the article to ignore. Another obvious question: why can&#x27;t some greedy person go collect these debts and get rich? Is this a business opportunity?<p>The article also chooses lots of odd base rates:<p>&quot;Most of MSDâ€™s customers are white, but the suits were largely filed against residents of black communities...&quot; - Isn&#x27;t the relevant comparison to the number of delinquent customers in the aforementioned regions?<p>&quot;...even accounting for income, the rate of judgments was twice as high in mostly black neighborhoods as it was in mostly white ones.&quot; Why are they accounting for income, rather than accounting for the amount of bad debt?<p>I don&#x27;t quite understand what this article is attempting to claim. Can someone clarify it for me?",1448784467

A declarative UI library for the web needs to have something like virtual DOM so that the actual DOM is strategically updated when a higher level component updates. No DOM state like input focusing is lost. The part that I don&#x27;t understand is when the author mentions that the &quot;nifty algorithms that operate on the Virtual DOM&quot; are the key to React&#x27;s speed. It was my understanding that 1: There are no algorithms that operate <i>on</i> the virtual dom. It is blindly updated every time a component update happens. And 2: That the algorithms that compare the virtual dom and the real dom are the essence of the &quot;Virtual DOM&quot; idea. In this sense, React is no different from the other declarative UI frameworks out there and this is where the point of the article was lost to me.",1448784342

People discuss ideas first because if they do the implementation first, there is a large risk of wasted effort because it &quot;may not follow the intent of the project&quot;. Discussion is in part effort to divine the intent of the project.<p>As a concrete example, I implemented break and continue for OCaml compiler because having for loop without break/continue seems to me obviously a bad idea. Although I learned a lot about OCaml compiler internals, this went nowhere. I learned my lesson, and now I will certainly &quot;endlessly discuss&quot; possibilities of break/continue first, without writing a single line of code. In my opinion, berating people for this is placing undue burden on contributors.<p><a href=""http://caml.inria.fr/pub/ml-archives/caml-list/2008/04/ce14ded0e6767696945a1aa95576dac0.en.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://caml.inria.fr/pub/ml-archives/caml-list/2008/04/ce14d...</a>",1448784164

9057437,comment,9056219,9056863,0,0,aaronem,,,"To be fair, I think there is a place for stuff like the Arduino, RPi, &c.; for example, I&#x27;ve got a couple of projects prototyped on my breadboard Pi right now, before I reimplement them on an MSP430 as I2C-connected peripherals, and even that&#x27;s an intermediate step on the road to my (very eventual) ultimate goal of making them operable via USB.<p>Now, as fancy as all that sounds, I&#x27;m basically a software guy who can just about use a soldering iron without putting himself in the hospital. If I had to start at the end, implementing a USB interface I as yet know next to nothing about, it&#x27;d be a very long time, if ever, before I managed to achieve anything.<p>If I had to start in the middle, with a simple-minded little 16-bit MCU and an I2C interface, I&#x27;d have almost as hard a time, not least because I&#x27;d have to find some way to bridge the devices I&#x27;m building and the software that drives them. (Off the top, I guess I could dig up an old USB-to-parallel adapter somewhere, then bit-bang I2C on the data lines or something, but I wouldn&#x27;t be delighted at having to go so far out of my way.)<p>Being able to start with an RPi, where I can address GPIO pins with `cat` and `echo`, and validate my idea before I start working my way up the complexity curve, is a great aid to actually being able to accomplish something. If I had EE training, that&#x27;d be one thing, of course, but I am, as mentioned, a software guy, picking up a new hobby in my spare time. Not having to learn everything all at once makes that worlds easier to achieve.<p>And, hey, if there <i>are</i> people who figure the answer to everything hardware is &quot;buy an Arduino and some shields&quot;, is that even necessarily so bad? They&#x27;re not looking to get into electrical engineering work, or at least I <i>hope</i> they&#x27;re not; they&#x27;re just excited to be able to do things they couldn&#x27;t do before, because the necessary degree of complexity was beyond their capabilities.

Much of the behavior of the language is simply too subtle and failure-prone to bother with, especially when working on projects that aren&#x27;t composed entirely of world-class JS devs (e.g. every project ever). In its full expressiveness, Javascript yields code that simply does not do what you think it does, unless you&#x27;ve memorized the 6 books of material documenting counterintuitive behavior.<p>I&#x27;m with the prevailing industry consensus, that Javascript has some brilliant parts to it, and when used judiciously, and with the right abstractions, it&#x27;s not so bad.

This was related, but different than my objectives in college, where I was mostly concerned about my _grades_ and completing a degree to show employers.  Although, not mutually exclusive, I find that when I&#x27;m focused on learning the subject completely, I&#x27;ll eventually go off the normal course guidelines and spend extra time on supplemental materials (blogs, additional explanations, etc..).  I&#x27;ll also spend extra time completing all the assignments as perfect as possible (doing the extra sections, etc..).  This is different than when I was in college, where I would often trade off a few extra grade percentage in order to make a deadline to achieve that A- or whatever.  Couple this with the fact that I defer the MOOC assignments if work/life gets in the way and eventually I miss the projects and test due dates.<p>IMO (speaking personally here) - I find this approach to be Much more beneficial than the traditional college system.  I learn the material better and have a deeper understanding of the entire subject.  I&#x27;ve officially &quot;failed&quot; every MOOC course I&#x27;ve taken, because of missed due-dates.  But when I look through the actual submissions, I usually receive near 100% on every assignment.

Everyone who has attended a traditional college has taken one or several classes where they disliked the material, the format, or the faculty but kept taking it anyway because it was a required course, they needed the credit hours to stay in good standing, or they had already paid nontrivial tuition and/or fees for it. For most MOOCs, if you are even mildly disappointed, you can just drop out with little remorse.<p>The second, less obvious one: on Coursera, I bookmark courses (including ones I have only tenuous interest in) months ahead by enrolling in them. Then when the course starts, I judge whether I still have the time or interest (I usually don&#x27;t), and if not, drop out. I don&#x27;t know if this is common, but if it is, then it would have an impact.<p>I&#x27;d also be curious to know how pacing impacts completion rates. Personally, while some platforms treat it as a selling point, I find it very difficult to complete self-paced courses. On the other hand, some people may miss one or two deadlines in a non-self-paced MOOC and simply give up.",1424101582

That&#x27;s a momentous change: iOS used to be so obvious.&quot; In iOS 7 basic usability features such as making buttons look like buttons are now stuffed under Accessibility options. About this, Tumblr co-founder Marco Arment wrote: &quot;If iOS 8 can’t remove any of these options, it&#x27;s a design failure.&quot; (And iOS 8 hasn&#x27;t.) Michael Heilemann, Interface Director at Squarespace wrote, &quot;when I look at [iOS 7 beta] I see anti-patterns and basic mistakes that should have been caught on the whiteboard before anyone even began thinking about coding it.&quot; And famed blogger John Gruber said this about iOS 7: &quot;my guess is that [Steve Jobs] would not have supported this direction.&quot;<p>And what about Jony&#x27;s other responsibility, industrial design? The iPod, iPhone, iPad, MacBook Air and other Apple products are all amazingly well designed and breathtakingly beautiful. But these products weren&#x27;t designed by Jony Ive all by himself. He designed them under Steve Jobs&#x27;s guidance and direction. Steve was the tastemaker. Apple&#x27;s post-Steve products are nowhere near as well-designed.<p>Consider iPhone 5c, for example. The colors are horrid, and when you add those Crocs-like cases it looks more like a Fisher-Price toy than like a device an executive would want to be seen holding. Then they released some ads for the 5c, and I kid you not, one of the ads had sounds of bleating farm animals. (It was titled &quot;Every color has a story&quot;, published on tumblr. That the 5c hasn&#x27;t done well in the market shouldn&#x27;t surprise anyone.<p>Of late Apple has done phenomenally well, financially. But this isn&#x27;t because of Jony Ive&#x27;s design. It is because of the ecosystem created by Steve Jobs.

And your title implies that no matter how much somebody knows about JavaScript, it&#x27;s not enough.<p>Two decades ago, I was really into learning all the disgusting corners of badly-designed programming languages. I got really excited about C++ implicit conversions and clever template hacks. But that always proved to be a mistake, because nobody wants to read or maintain any of that crap.<p>These days, I try to focus on the essentials of a language: What works well and portably? What offers unique expressive capabilities that I haven&#x27;t seen before? What&#x27;s idiomatic? If I learn any nasty corner-cases, I only do it solve a specific problem, or to avoid pitfalls.<p>I really can&#x27;t get excited about the implicit conversion semantics of JavaScript&#x27;s &quot;==&quot; operator or the weirder points of how &quot;this&quot; get bound in callbacks. It&#x27;s all just pointless technical arcana. If something neither expands my brain nor solves an immediate commercial problem, I&#x27;m happy ignoring it until it becomes obsolete.

9057229,comment,9056799,9056799,0,0,falcolas,,,"> Use Javascript everywhere<p>And here I thought the author was trying to simplify their life. Using Javascript on the server is not simplifying your life.<p>By writing Javascript on the server, they have made it all but impossible to reason about code&#x27;s execution order and performance - it&#x27;s going to depend entirely on epoll and the underlying threaded IO implementations. They are also relying on the developer&#x27;s ability to understand and use continuations properly.<p>There are some developers who can do this (just as there are some developers who can write threading code without any race conditions), but most others will rely on so many layers of abstraction (which they don&#x27;t fully understand) that they are hardly writing Javascript anymore.<p>&quot;In the past year I think I have finally come to understand the ideals of Unix: file descriptors and processes orchestrated with C. It’s a beautiful idea. This is not however what we interact with. The complexity was not contained. Instead I deal with DBus and /usr/lib and Boost and ioctls and SMF and signals and volatile variables and prototypal inheritance and C99FEATURES_ and dpkg and autoconf.<p>Those of us who build on top of these systems are adding to the complexity. Not only do you have to understand $LD_LIBRARY_PATH to make your system work but now you have to understand $NODE_PATH too - there’s my little addition to the complexity you must now know!&quot;",1424100090
9057228,comment,9055680,9056642,0,0,mike_hearn,,,"Yes, you nailed it. They know Tim Cook can&#x27;t carry the brand as a detail obsessed designer so they need Ive to do so instead.<p>The problem is, does it work? I got a few impressions from the article, beyond &quot;Jony Ive is a really nice guy&quot; which everyone seems to agree on.<p>One: all his experience is in hardware. All of it. He wasn&#x27;t given any responsibility over software design when Jobs was in charge at all. This leads to the question of why, given their closeness .... I suspect it&#x27;s because Jobs knew that Ive is really an industrial hardware designer and the skills needed to do great software design are different.<p>Two: he comes across as kind of burned out. He&#x27;s spent years designing a relatively small number of products, most of which are (as the article points out) basically just variants on the same &quot;slab of glass with a button&quot; idea. Can he really feel like he&#x27;s fully exercising his design muscles in such an environment? The article says several times he&#x27;s sort of wanted to leave and go off and do other things like luxury products several times, but feels he can&#x27;t go now because so many Apple employees depend on him.<p>Another thing is that the Apple (hardware) design team seems to be a lot smaller than I expected. They have three recruiters and hire one designer <i>per year</i>? Seriously? I&#x27;ve seen picky hiring before at Google but one hire per year given three full time recruiters is crazy. This is meant to impress upon us how incredibly elite and discerning Ive is. I read something else in it: they are all friends who trust each other, and quite simply don&#x27;t like hiring. They are expected to do it by the company but would much prefer not to.<p>It also leads me to think they are having problems. The iPod and iPhone were huge successes, partly because none of the competitors in those spaces cared much about industrial design. In some areas (in-car systems?) that&#x27;s still the case. But increasingly Apple has been competing with Google and the big Asian firms for consumer electronics, and there they have been losing their edge.<p>They started talking about the Apple watch in 2011. In 2015 it&#x27;s still not on the market. Meanwhile the Android team and their hardware partners have launched several watches, of which the round Moto 360 has been attracting the most attention (disclosure: I got one for Christmas, it&#x27;s neat). But despite a 50+ page article, the journalist lets Jony Ive dismiss round watches in the span of a single sentence. Apparently they just &quot;don&#x27;t make sense&quot; because smart watches are using &quot;for lists&quot;. Except that they do make sense and the one I have works pretty well.<p>I got the strong impression from reading this that the design team at Apple is small, insular, ignores their competition completely, doesn&#x27;t want to scale up and doesn&#x27;t feel any real sense of urgency. For example, they work long hours but many of those hours were spent making dozens of slightly different sized models so they could rediscover the insight that people wanted larger smartphone screens. Something that all the other smartphone makers had already realised ages ago, designed and shipped. Surely they could have reduced their time to market by simply spending some time with their competitors products instead?",1424100089

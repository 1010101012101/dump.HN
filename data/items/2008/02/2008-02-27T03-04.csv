Witten-Bell and Good-Turing are the ones I can think of off the top of my head.",1204084593

It's worth a read.<p>I don't really think that the answer to your question lies in user of programming methodologies.  I do think that you can get great improvements in productivity based on tool selection, however.  See PG's essays on beating the averages.<p><i>will we ever reach the point where users/customers/clients can have very capable and sophisticated custom made or customized applications for a price that warrants ""wasteful"" or ""trivial"" (for trivial reasons) software development?</i><p>I think it's already being done.<p>Non-programmers are already using specialized scripting languages like BBS code, or html tags to customize their web pages, forum posts and blogs.  People are using Excel scripting to write their own mini financial applications.  Graphics programs like Maya, Houdini and After Effects have built in scripting languages for procedural graphics.  And, years ago, the Word Perfect word processor was built on the idea of a template language for document layout.",1204084591

Focusing on school and a startup is sure one circus act that I'm still having trouble with, but staying up for two days straight is not a good idea. The best way to get things done is to manage your time well and get as much sleep as possible. I try to focus on working out, making my launch stay to one date, and keeping my grade above average. This requires me to get as much rest as possible, I sleep for 8 hours a day and I get a lot done.",1204083950

The arms are like $200 from Provantage;  you can get a 24"" widescreen monitor for $300 to $400. That puts you at $500 or $600; buy another arm for $100 and you get to use the 18"" monitor too (although, again, I didn't know that worked. Are Macbook Pros even niftier than I thought?)",1204083437

124476,comment,124191,124191,0,0,thaumaturgy,,,"I recently set a client up with a GroupReady installation (<a href=""http://groupready.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://groupready.com/</a>). They make some pretty solid scheduling, contact management, and office communication software. Almost every time I've called them, I've gotten friendly, competent service. (I'm not affiliated with them in any way other than as a customer.)<p>The reason I mention them is, they're not a big business. They're family owned and run, and they're doing gangbusters.<p>Pretty much, I'm a complete ignoramus at what it takes to be a successful software company. But, if I were to look at those guys -- who I don't think are all that far off from what you're doing -- then I think that the following formula will work:<p>1. Make sure people can find you. I found GroupReady while digging through Google looking for scheduling software.<p>2. Be really straightforward. I ended up disregarding some competing companies because they wanted me to fill out an online form to get a price quote before they'd even talk to me.<p>3. Keep improving your product. Looking at what Quickbooks is doing is useful in that it can give you hints for what people want, but mostly, concentrate on your product. Like Guy Kawasaki says, churn churn churn.<p>4. Be reachable. I absolutely love being able to ring up GroupReady once a month or so, when I get stuck, and talk to Barry or one of the other guys there. It lets me get a call from my client, visit their office, work on their problem for a bit, and then if I get stuck, immediately get an answer.<p>I think if you hit those points, your market will find you. Maybe not all at once the way a lot of startups like, but you'll have a sustainable business and that's not so bad. As you become more stable, more people and small businesses will trust you.<p>Also, I'm interested in what you've got. My little one-man operation just picked up a second person, I'm drowning in work, and my books are pretty much ... well, I don't wanna talk about it (eek).",1204081852

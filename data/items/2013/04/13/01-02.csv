I have noticed that I will have an almost exact replica ""burned into"" my vision when I close my eyes. I can then (somewhat) manipulate this image in my mind. I've kinda thought that these changes in light (from whatever we are looking at) creates the initial image and then this image can be manipulated in the mind. I think that the retina or the parts of the brain that are involved in visual imagery must somehow be involved in these visualizations we are seeing (not the after image). It would be inefficient to develop a new skill from scratch, a big part of our brain is already dedicated to sight and imagery, so I wonder if we can somehow make use of the visual cortex to enhance our ability to visualize things?<p>Need to find a way to hack into the subconscious..",1365817589

They have bought access to a service which might not align to their needs anymore and they likely wouldn't have access to the version which they paid for. Sure, a dollar is a small amount, but I feel as though the effect is more pronounced than with free services. Heck, free services get flack a lot of the time for changing strategy or shutting down.<p>I guess if your feedback and learnings are from the vocal majority, you might underestimate the backlash from the silent <i>real</i> majority.<p>Furthermore, what happens when you have 10 paid signups (let's say $10 total) for a service that needs $100 worth of infrastructure? Do you end the service and refund the money? Do you pocket the money and move on? Do you fork up the remaining infrastructure cost from your pocket and continue?

Imagine if trademarks worked this way -- right now to get a trademark you have to actually use it (or certify that you intend to use it), you can't just squat on a thousand different names and hope somebody is eventually willing to pay you for one of them.<p>And the solution should be the same. You can't sell a trademark. What you can do is sell the goodwill it has accrued and transfer the mark along with it. That sounds like the same thing, right? But if you haven't used it there is no goodwill -- in fact, if you stop using a trademark then you eventually lose the rights to it. It shuts down the squatters but not anyone else, which is why we don't have trademark squatters the same as we do domain name squatters.",1365817371

5542184,comment,5538595,5541166,1,0,SaxonDruce,,,"We spent about $1600 on ads, resulting in about 3,000,000 impressions and about 2,000 clicks through to the app's promo page (<a href=""http://www.class3outbreak.com/iphone-ipad-ipod-touch/games/zombie-outbreak-simulator"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.class3outbreak.com/iphone-ipad-ipod-touch/games/z...</a>). From there it's impossible to tell how many of those people bought the game, but I assume it's much less than 100%.<p>Those clicks cost us 80c each. This is not effective for a $1 app which gives a 70c profit after Apple's 30% cut. Even for a $2 app, it would only be effective if about 60% of people who clicked the ad bought the app - it seems unlikely that it would be anywhere near that high.<p>Most advertising seems to cost about $1 per click. Based on the cost per click and the potential return from a sale I don't think advertising is cost-effective for promoting apps. The only way it might work is if you spend tens of thousands of dollars, so you're on ""all"" the websites and so ""everyone"" becomes aware of your app. Therefore it gets talked about, and each click results in potentially more than one sale, by spreading through word of mouth. This also only works if the game is good enough :)<p>I mentioned briefly in the blog post that we got a few reviews written up. Jay contacted dozens of review sites and sent out about 20-30 review codes. We had a poor response.<p>In the end I think the only marketing that was really effective was that we had an existing community around the web versions of our games - at the time of ZOS's release we had about 30,000 visitors a month to our website, and about 8,000 fans on Facebook. I think this is the main reason that we did as well as we did :)",1365817255

When I selected from the set they gave me (the list below the box to type in a manual query), Bing honestly won every single round. That's actually how they ran the experiment: they gave each person a set of search terms chosen from the Google Zeitgeist to select from. If you are curious to learn more about the experiment, Microsoft has a not-terribly-in-depth article covering the setup (there may be something more in-depth somewhere, but this is what Bing forwarded me to and it at least seems to directly answer your question).<p><a href=""http://www.bing.com/blogs/site_blogs/b/search/archive/2013/02/06/bing-your-brain-test-then-test-again.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bing.com/blogs/site_blogs/b/search/archive/2013/0...</a><p>Frankly, though, the reason that I believe Bing kept winning for me is that for these really popular core queries, the results were very similar: Bing simply selected more useful text snippets from news articles (letting me avoid clicking results) and weirdly even had better page titles, so it made what was overall the same results more pleasant to use. When I selected my own queries, though, the fact that Google continues to (and will forever) have a larger selection of the Internet available to its search engine became the deciding factor, as it would surface a few interesting things that Bing wouldn't catch.<p>What I thereby obtain from Bing it On! is not that I want to switch from Google, but that Google has too much power at this point: they are probably forever going to get my search queries simply because they figured out how to index the web extensively and efficiently before ""how to build scalable systems"" became more general knowledge (although some of that is actually due to Google, so there's this part of me that is saying ""shut up and be grateful""), but now that they have this lead there's no real way to kick them down, even if someone else has managed to use the data they have more effectively.",1365816898

However,  this is a significant digit,  especially for older equipment.<p>If you pressed 0,  you would get the operator immediately.  No phone numbers could begin with zero.<p>If you pressed 1,  you would be connected to a long distance trunk and an area code would then be expected.  No local prefixes could begin with 1.<p>If you pressed any other number it was a local call.<p>Also,  on analog networks,  maximum modem speed was 56kbps.  64k was the theoretical maximum,  but the FCC placed limits on the amount of power you could have in certain frequency bands on the line -- hence 56k was the maximum speed.<p>On a purely digital network,  like ISDN,  you could receive 64kbps on each channel.",1365814987

If you have your name tied to a review chances are you are going to be more honest. Don't get me wrong anonymity is extremely important on the web, but you can't deny that it is abused. Look at the current state of YouTube. YouTube has some of the nastiest comments around. Instead of censoring, Google had an idea to tie your name to your comments. If you read comments by users using their  name they aren't saying things like ""Go f<i></i>* yourself you f<i></i><i>ing f</i>g. I f<i></i>*ed your mother last night"". The truth of the matter is everyone loves to attack Google for Google+, but the real threat to anonymity are companies that write and sponsor bills like SOPA, PIPA, and CISPA.",1365814980

There will be losers and winners in this case. People who bought them early cash out and earn a huge profit. So where does the profits come from? Thin air? From people who buy them at a higher price. And how do they cash out without making a loss? By cashing out at a higher prices when other people are buying.<p>It's almost like a never ending cycle until maybe bitcoin prices reaches infinity and beyond. Someone has to win and someone will lose. You can't have everyone becoming bitcoin millionaires. Big issue now is bitcoin prices are dropping fast.

If it doesn't, they'll get bored and quit. In that case, the best people leave and you have a ghetto.<p>Right now, Kaggle makes sense because ""data science"" is still an ill-defined field but a lot of people want to get into it, and no one knows what it means or takes to get in, so people will try things out to see what happens.<p>If Kaggle wants to stay in play for the long term, they'll need to get <i>really</i> good at connecting talented people with very high-quality jobs.<p>There is something that I don't think all of the hiring-related startups get yet: as things are, there's such a shortage of quality jobs. That's a 5-year existential threat to the whole business model. What happens when people realize that these sexy startup jobs are just corporate jobs with better marketing? What happens when the dream dies? Right now, high-quality jobs are too rare for the hiring startups (unless the  genuinely change the economy) to prevent people from getting just as disillusioned with these new services as they are with headhunters. Now, that's not because there's an intrinsic limit on interesting work (see: Lump of Labor fallacy) but we'd have to overthrow the management of a whole industry to change that.<p>Now, data science. It is attractive right now because it carries with it a promise of what <i>software engineering</i> was supposed to deliver but, for most people, doesn't: interesting work, implicit respect, autonomy. I feel like data scientist in many companies means ""software engineer who gets dibs on the most interesting projects"". I'm afraid that title inflation into the data science field might dilute that, however.<p>What we really need is to fire 90+ percent of software managers and trust engineers to pick their own projects and call some shots.

America has horrible mass media, that does not even talk\nabout real issues, what is going on in the country.\n2. Americans overall have not seen so many horrible things that Europe during it is own history - there is simply no collective idea what big problems may look like.<p>There are many other reasons, but majority of people here I beleive are Americans, I am not going to insult them.",1240297138

Facebook came in somewhere around ~$250 million (admittedly not profitable yet, but that's high revenue. Only a matter of time).<p>That's pretty damned interesting.<p><i>Somebody</i> is willing to pay for services these companies provide; they must not be all hype. Twitter will likely find a revenue model as well (not as high as the other two, I would suspect, but still).<p>I'm sorry if it seems harsh, but these companies have had copious amounts of sweat and blood poured into them, and have grown into huge revenue generating machines.

It is scary how much I identify with the people mentioned in the article (minus the stimulants and the partying). After reading that so many people want to live the way I've been living for the past five months, I can't help but feel pity for the western world. Counter intuitively, working so hard makes me feel small, unimportant, and unhappy. None of the work I'm doing right now matters in the long run, but it forces me to abandon side projects that might be.<p>For people to want to live their lives in this way for more than a few months to achieve specific goals seems extremely shallow. There is little in life, save saving your own life, that would warrant this kind of constant grinding effort. We should be creative, happy creatures, not constantly constrained by time and energy. All these drugs allow us to do is become the epitome of a World of Warcraft player.<p>The marginal gains of these drugs(at the moment) do not appear to be worth it to me.

I just had a cigarette, so I am in no position to argue :-) That said, at 38 I'm painfully aware of the deleterious effects of smoking for the last 2 decades and unable to be flippant about this.

Imagination can be an awful thing sometimes.<p>I've played Rejection Therapy for awhile now, and it's given me the courage to reach out to estranged family members, to give up my seat on the bus to women, to ask a stranger with a cast if I could walk her dog.<p>I am a good person, with good intentions, but I am extremely shy by nature and it has handicapped my personality. I've lived alone for many years because of my extreme awkwardness around women. Now I try to reach out to others, even women, despite my fear. I'm now aware that my comfort zone is a cage.

2026706,comment,2024252,2024478,0,0,uvdiv,,,"> we need better, more cost-effective energy, such as with better nuclear power plants<p>I don't think this will work. Some numbers:<p>* USDA says 70 bushels/acre of wheat is the average yield for irrigated fields [1]<p>* perhaps a theoretical 3 harvests/year [2] could be possible in a climate-controlled building (it takes 110-130 days between planting and harvest), for 210 bushels/acre/year<p>* solar irradiation amounts to an annual average of about 4 kWh/day/m^2 = 170 W/m^2 in the wheat belt [3], or up to about 6.5 kWh/day/m^2 = 270 W/m^2 average in July<p>* March 2011 wheat futures are $7.67/bushel on the CME [4]<p>So I reason: with the cheapest $0.05/kWh electricity (nuclear, hydro, or coal at large-buyer rates), the cost to imitate sunlight, with ""100% efficient"" lighting (maybe LEDs), would be in the range of $300,000-$500,000/acre per year [5]. (I think the higher figure is closer -- it corresponds to sustaining July-level insolation year round, which would make sense for year-round planting). Which divides up to about $2,500/bushel -- over 300 times current prices. (For household-scale perspective, this is $70/liter).<p>You can get incremental improvements in power plant economics, but not orders of magnitude (not anytime soon).

And those were persistent comments; seems like this will have the same sensitivity-to-conditions problems where a page(/domain/whatever atomic unit) either has 1000 users or 0, only since there's no persistence it all has to happen at once so you'll trend even more towards 0 and have an even-smaller sweet spot. (20 notes on a page? Pleasantly active. 20 people talking...?)<p>Since you mention it, I was the one who first worked out how to block ThirdVoice; their little image tags were all assigned the same class and so one CSS rule made them all display: none. They ""fixed"" that, so I made a JS script that ran after theirs that could look at img source and remove them if they were Third Voice's. At that point they changed their license to forbid those who downloaded the program from ""interfering with another user's experience of the product"", and while I would happily have refrained from downloading it and clean-room implemented something, it was never an issue; their day in the sun had passed.<p>Technical detail: ThirdVoice was implemented as an Internet Explorer plugin that worked in the context of the page itself, so all the DOM nodes were accessible within the page once ThirdVoice ""fired"", which, in a 1999 browser, was a very noticable event. If in fact it was still around today, it would be notorious for breaking otherwise-functional websites by changing the DOM in ways the website didn't expect. They also had the usual bad HTML filtering, so their product allowed you to insert cross-site scripting attacks into arbitrary sites. I was able to convince <p onmouseover=""""> to work, another group discovered <bgsound src=""""> worked as soon as you opened the note with no further interaction. Fun times.<p>(And I count myself vindicated by time; this approach never took off, and the one I advocated did, which was sites that aggregate links and collect comments and communities on their own. Sites such as, oh, say, Hacker News. Or less crowd-panderingly, Slashdot, MetaFilter, Digg, Reddit, etc. Please forgive me if I take a moment to toss that in here, ten years later.)",1292898436

I'll even wager you are probably looking for a product that requires minimal unit production and distribution costs.  That puts you in a class of products that are electronic, or products that you can convert from an electronic representation to a physical one and have a supplier to deal with those physical challenges (like shipping) for you.  People often forget the 2nd option, but it's there.<p>A short list of items that meet this qualification:  software, writing (books, novellas, blogs, etc.), digital art, digital photography, music (original), sound of other types (background sounds that can be used in the production of music, for example), designs/instructions (for building something) and a probably a bunch of other stuff.  If I missed a big one, please reply to this post with it.  You should also be looking for free resources online that you can leverage.  Are there free services that you can leverage to make your business easier to manage?  Can you do some work (collection or processing) of some freely available data that might give it additional value which you can then extract through sales or in some other way?<p>Because your goal is to make a living and give yourself some extra freedom, you don't have to overengineer this.  This isn't your masterpiece.  It doesn't have to be pretty or break new ground necessarily.  Don't chrome plate it if you're writing software for it or to support it.<p>Frankly, I just started taking advantage of this type of business and I feel almost guilty.  The code isn't that great.  The idea isn't that great.  It's not something to write home about in terms of engineering a solution.  But it makes me money even if I don't touch it for a month at a time.  I'm not living off this business yet, but I am seeing good growth and I see a virtually infinite path to expanding the digitally based offerings of the business (more offerings = more money).",1292897417

1205761,comment,1205647,1205735,0,0,necubi,,,"I evaluated both pretty extensively and eventually decided to go with sproutcore.<p>Cappuccino is in many ways more revolutionary and the SC, as it completely throws out any notion of dealing with HTML and CSS. By completely abstracting the presentation some things become easier, but some things become impossible (for example: they cappuccino devs haven't implemented all of CGGraphics, and that makes some things that are trivial in CSS, like rounding the corners of an image, effectively impossible). With SC you're working with HTML and CSS, though most of the HTML is generated by JS. I found the latter approach more flexible, especially if you can target CSS3-supporting browsers.<p>Both are based on cocoa, though Cappuccino takes its influences much more seriously. I love cocoa but I'm not terribly enamored with Obj-C syntax, so I don't really see why someone would want to take JS's superior syntax and replace it with Obj-C's, as cappuccino has done. Cappuccino also lacks a data store framework, while SC has a very good one.<p>Finally, SC uses native browser rendering as much as possible, which should make SC apps faster.<p>That said, I think Cappuccino has a lot of potential, and 280Atlas, a visual editor for cappuccino apps written in itself shows that. As it matures and the basically non-existent docs improve I think it will become increasingly worthwhile.",1269048569

A great part of the city does not have tarmac roads, but rather tiled roads of bricks resting on sand. The surface is easy to drive on and extremely well-maintained.<p>So when you go out at night it's common to see work crews building new infrastructure by lifting up the bricks and piling them to one side, digging up the sand and working on pipes and conduits, followed by replacement of the sand and the bricks. By 7am or so they have gone, the street looks exactly the same as it did the day before, and the next night they return and do it all over again farther up the street. They make relatively little noise, traffic is largely undisturbed, and the construction crews operate with  military-like discipline.<p>Not a very portable solution, but one that infrastructure planners might do well to consider for long-term development.

In an environment where subsequent fundings are highly likely for quality companies, they can work fine; in today's dicier environment, much less so.<p>One point about the author's cost/benefit comparison of legal fees for doing notes as opposed to doing a straight Series A funding. If the angels are friendly and do not push too hard to try to convert the Series A into a VC-style round, the processing costs of doing the preferred-stock approach can be as little as $5K. It is only the angel groups that function almost like VCs that require the sort of complex transactional documents that will run costs up to $25K+.<p>The potential for low-cost Series A docs, of course, is one more reason in today's environment to go ahead and price the stock and do a Series A in lieu of kicking the can down the road.<p>Of course, pricing has its own issues because this can take away flexibility in how a board will price options as incentives for key people and will also typically require the startup to do 409A compliance earlier in connection with its options pricing (which in turn may add $5K to $10K to immediate costs).",1269048251

Different hosts allow different characters in usernames, and have different meta-replacement rules for stuff like periods and pluses.<p>You don't validate a domain name with a regex, you use a goddamn DNS resolver. Email addresses are a superset of that! Don't use a fucking regex.",1269047013

The docs aren't great, but once you get you're head around it it's very productive.<p>For me, it feels like the biggest paradigm shift since Rails. Rails made it easy write dynamic ajax-based websites, but they were still websites. With SproutCore, you're truly writing web applications, which run entirely in the browser and only go to the server for data. This means desktop-level responsiveness.<p>Congratulations for the dev team on the release, and I look forward to the exciting stuff to come in 1.1!",1269046948

Practicuum - Internship - n/a.<p>I put in 22~ hours/semester for a year in 8 week courses at Navarro College in Corsicana, Texas. While I was finishing the program, the partnership doing internships (Northrop Grumman) had a breakup with the college and left my 6 man class without a place to call home for the final part of the course. Now, we have a wasted year of work, no certificate, and no law suit (they relisted the course load this year in their catalog and really tempted me (it clearly states they still have a partnership)). 0 of the credits transfer to my university.<p>So, an e-internship sounds like it would be the final piece for me to complete that certificate. I have given up on it for the most part though and just regard that year of work as my first taste of the business world. Some of us are desperate! Especially with some of the horrid Dallas internship offers... (ruby internship offer @ 70+ hours a week unpaid)",1269046932

I've been playing around with it for the past week or so.<p>It can do some really cool things, and works a lot more like desktop GUI toolkits than most web app frameworks. (Both in terms of how it works, and in terms of how it performs.) I've been told it's much easier to learn if you know Cocoa, but I don't, so I can't comment on that.",1269046811

Androids share is growing because the carriers have flexibility in how they distribute it and end users could not care less about fragmentation.  That is a problem for developers, sure, but it is not affecting adoption by end-users.</i><p>a) developers who develop on Android rarely develop for all fragmented versions (or skew releases to not support old versions - the fragmentation does take resources and the effect shrinks your market) so grouping them together is kind of a misnomer - though I get it, and b) android apps still tend to make much less money than iOS apps.

3842055,comment,3840979,3841727,1,0,bootup,,,"Thanks for sharing this, Josh!<p>I absolutely agree with Nikos' approach to teaching programming young learners without using an actual code. If we teach kids the idea of programming early - it will then be much more intuitive for them to pick up the language formalities later. Because by that time, such a fundamental question as ""why"" is already answered in practice.<p>In other words, the time for a real language comes as an actual need that has been experienced in practice and doing. And that makes all the difference in understanding what you need and why.<p>It's all over the web that more and more parents and teachers come to appreciate the idea of teaching kids to code. But the problem is that they don't know where to even begin or what tools to use. As a result, kids looking to learn programming today are faced with two main extremes:<p>(1) storytelling, game dev, and animation programs; and \n(2) real-world languages or tools based on IDEs;<p>Programs in the first category are all fine, except for cases when the app is too compute-intensive, or 3D objects are clumsy or rough-looking (but these problems are just temporary).<p>But those using real-world IDEs to introduce programming are effectively training young pilots on real fighter jets. Such tools seem too complex and intimidating even for experienced computer users. What they really ought to be using is a ""flight simulator"", but currently there are too few tools that allow to do that and all pretty limited.<p>Even when we have something that useful it makes absolute sense to use physical games in the gym to introduce the notion of composing instructions for something/someone else (a parent-robot in Nikos' case :)<p>Nikos, thanks for sharing your work, and congrats on joining Knewton!<p>Hope you don't mind me including a link to videos of your class once again:<p><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/drtechniko"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/drtechniko</a>",1334439251

Of the classes I took, only Udacity had programming exercises. For one of my friends, \nwho had never taken programming, the course managed to capture his interest.<p>Udacity's courseload  is:<p>i: video followed by a short quiz(multiple choice, fill in the blank, etc.) or a programming exercise(Create a function that takes 2 numbers and outputs the bigger one, etc.) There are generally anywhere from 25-40 videos, each 30 seconds to 4 minutes long.<p>ii: A series of homework assignments. These can be either quizzes or programming tasks. You can submit them, but you don't know whether you got it correct until some deadline, when your homework is graded. THe programming exercises are quite a bit harder.<p>One of the ones my friend struggled with for a while was a task to build a function that checked whether a sudoku square was valid when entered in a certain format.\niii: At the end of each week, there is a time where they have some kind of IRC/audio channel set up, and you can ask them questions live.<p>2. All the courses are the same quality.

3842029,comment,3841756,3841756,27,0,csallen,,,"Charlie Munger (Warren Buffett's partner) has kept a long-running list of psychological tendencies that commonly affect people's judgment. There's one item on this list that he's termed ""Availability-Misweighing Tendency."" In a nutshell, it's an observation that people tend to overweigh extra-vivid evidence, which (necessarily) means <i>under-weighing</i> evidence that isn't so vivid.<p>In this case, the extra-vivid evidence is the Instagram acquisition. It's been analyzed, or at least covered, by every blog and news network I can think of. I'm sure it's clogging most of our Twitter feeds. I even have friends and relatives who know nothing about tech but want to talk about it. It doesn't get much more vivid than that. And even if it wasn't receiving so much coverage, a billion dollars is enough money to be vivid in-and-of itself.<p>The point is, if you're re-thinking your business strategy or personal goals based on this news, you should tread carefully. The remedy to overweighing extra-vivid evidence is to always make it a point to seek out other side of the story. So I agree with Mark when he encourages ""all other companies to do the harder work of finding out what happens in the 99.9% case, which is what is often never written in the annals of the tech news media.""",1334438532

3841978,comment,3824247,3829888,1,0,nupark2,,,"> <i>Yes, this is a trite and negligible truth of PHP. A developer suffering any significant loss of productivity due to problems like mismatched needle/haystack parameters just isn't very competent. It's a non-issue if the developer is being paid a real salary. I'm not saying these issues aren't important enough to warrant attention, but the debate between maintaining backwards compatibility and squashing bad practices certainly isn't exclusive to PHP.</i><p>You're just hand-waving away the issue. ""Yes, you have to keep far more in your head at once to make sure you don't step on a PHP landmine, but that's why we're paid the big bucks!""<p>I'm sorry, but this is a false dichotomy and an inaccurate parallel with C. C's landmines are well-defined, understood, and derive from the target purpose (portable assembly). PHP's landmines are ambiguous, ill-defined, and just plain stupid, often caused by what amounts to a truly brain-dead lack of cognitive effort on behalf of the language authors. The language is poorly specified such that even if a developer should wish to invest sufficient effort, it's impossible to know where they all are.<p>Moreover, there are such ugly corner cases built into the language and common libraries that some landmines are entirely unavoidable. Whose brilliant plan was it to make fopen() accept URL parameters instead of defining a common stream API that arbitrary stream types could support?<p>Let's say I want to treat a byte array as a stream -- this is a pretty common thing to do in most languages:<p><pre><code>  fopen('data:text/plain;base64,'.base64_encode($data), 'rb');\n</code></pre>\nAre you bloody kidding me? That's just the smallest, tiniest tip of the PHP iceberg of stupid-in-action.<p>> <i>And did that inertia spontaneously emerge from a vacuum? In the spirit of PHP's namesake you've devised a recursive argument to explain the only conceivable upside to using PHP.</i><p>PHP's inertia emerged out of ill-qualified individuals adopting the language as the most visible available option during a time when there was largely a dearth of options and limited understanding of the web as a platform and ""what comes next"" from CGI.<p>People -- collectively, as a group -- adopt poor solutions to their problems, simply as a matter of compounding gravitation and a lack of understanding of the long-term implications.<p>It's simple group decision making, and it's not reasoned, nor is it necessarily likely to produce the best possible answer, or even a good one -- <i>especially</i> when the group in question is ill-equipped to understand the problem space they're working in.",1334437355

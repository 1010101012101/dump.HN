9230414,comment,9229900,9230388,0,0,Rangi42,,,"Without disputing your main point about how philosophers typically behave, I want to clarify the is-water-H2O argument. As I understand it, it&#x27;s making a point about how we use language: people have been using the word &quot;water&quot; to refer to various puddles, lakes, oceans, beverages, etc for a long time before electrolysis was discovered. We know now that all those instances have being-H2O in common, but it&#x27;s not a necessary property for the word &quot;water&quot; to apply: if some other chemical fulfilled the everyday requirements for water (being clear, wet, thirst-quenching, etc) without being H2O, it would be &quot;water,&quot; and if a particular variation of H2O doesn&#x27;t fulfill those requirements (^2H2O, heavy water, is poisonous) then it&#x27;s not water.

It is a mental dysfunction, a kind of inbuilt rigidity of mind, that is peculiar to the breed.<p>For example, there is an actual argument in the philosophy of science that is based on the supposition that there is a substance that is &quot;identical to water in every respect&quot; but &quot;is not H2O but rather XYZ&quot;.<p>Philosophers take this &quot;argument&quot; quite seriously, and get rather testy when you point out that the premise is a contradiction: if something has &quot;all the properties of water&quot;, then that must include properties under electrolysis, and under electrolysis water decomposes to 2H and O, not X, Y and Z (whatever those might be). If you say this to a philosopher they will reply, &quot;Yes, but what if it doesn&#x27;t?&quot; as if that was a coherent statement.<p>So the answer to your question is, &quot;Because if we allowed ourselves to discard one of the premises we&#x27;d have a much harder time motivating this whole ridiculous discussion, and since our livelihood depends on such ridiculous discussions, we&#x27;re not about to let that happen!&quot;",1426744105

Since the latter set is uncountable (by Cantor&#x27;s diagonal argument), the former must be as well. This argument appears to me to be correct.<p>The followup retracts the above argument, basically because of this counter-argument:<p>&quot;just as there’s no way to fol­low 0.333... un­til you reach ex­actly one-third, there’s no way to carve a pixel un­til you get to the ex­act point rep­re­sented by a cer­tain in­fi­nite bi­nary string&quot;<p>However, this counter-argument is incorrect, because it leaves out a key qualifier. There is no way to &quot;follow 0.333... until you reach exactly one-third&quot; <i>in a finite number of steps</i>. If you take an infinite number of steps, you <i>do</i> reach exactly one-third: that is what the statement &quot;one-third is the limit of the repeating decimal 0.333...&quot; means. True, you can&#x27;t explicitly take an infinite number of steps, but you can calculate, mathematically, what the result would be if you did; that is how we know what the limit points are of sequences like 0.333...<p>Similarly, &quot;there&#x27;s no way to carve a pixel until you get to the exact point represented by a certain infinite binary string&quot; <i>in a finite number of steps</i>. But you <i>can</i> do it in an infinite number of steps, and the article explicitly postulates exactly that--an infinite number of pixel divisions. And even though we can&#x27;t explicitly do an infinite number of pixel divisions, we can still calculate, mathematically, what the result would be if we did. That result is the set of infinite binary strings; that set is the limit point of the sequence of pixel divisions, as the number of divisions goes to infinity, just as one-third is the limit point of the sequence 0.333... as the number of 3&#x27;s goes to infinity.",1426743087

9230347,comment,9229900,9229900,0,0,Xcelerate,,,"Odd -- contrary to other users&#x27; comments, I don&#x27;t find this topic silly at all.  As I see it, &quot;science&quot; is the ability to predict the future†.  That&#x27;s all.  And thus a better prediction corresponds to better science.  For instance, quantum electrodynamics has been used to calculate the gyromagnetic ratio of an isolated electron to 10 digits of experimental accuracy.  That&#x27;s incredible.  In terms of predictive capability, the order goes: physics > chemistry > biology > psychology.  That&#x27;s not to say that any field is less valuable than any other; it&#x27;s just that the higher level fields are more complex, and thus it is harder to formulate predictive models for them.<p>So if the value of science is its predictive capacity, then how does one verify that capacity?  Through reproducibility.  This property is essential to modern research; all scientific results must be able to be reproduced by anyone (assuming they have the appropriate equipment and the ability to adhere strictly to a specific procedure).  For if reproducibility were not a requirement, then science would be of little value.<p>For some reason, a lot of scientists (or maybe just people on the internet who like the idea of science) pigeonhole themselves into the philosophies of positivism, physicalism, and materialism.  I don&#x27;t know why.  I do research in quantum chemistry, and even as I learn more about the subject (and quantum field theory), no increase in knowledge has ever changed my philosophical stance.  The only thoughts that run through my mind as I learn more are &quot;Cool, now I can make better predictions&quot; or &quot;Hey, that&#x27;s kind of elegant that nature works that way&quot;.<p>I find it odd, then, that so many people derive their entire life philosophy from sensory input corresponding to <i>output</i> from other <i>humans</i>.  It&#x27;s weird to me.  If one were to plant a microchip that affected optical nerves into the brain of one of these people, and the microchip caused them to see an object that wasn&#x27;t there, I would hardly be surprised if they denied seeing the object at all once they realized the object&#x27;s visibility wasn&#x27;t &quot;reproducible&quot;.<p>Is it really the case that so many believe that what is real is not only what is personally experienced, but what is also <i>supposedly</i> personally experienced (and thus communicated) by others?<p>Playing devil&#x27;s advocate, assume the simulation hypothesis (I don&#x27;t actually believe it, but it&#x27;s useful to illustrate my point).  Furthermore, suppose that each individual human has been fed sensory input that only <i>they</i> are capable of experiencing, but the input is both personally predictable and reproducible.  And lastly, the program running the universe does not allow any chain of interactions to exist that would permit the information describing these individual experiences to be transmitted to other humans.<p>What&#x27;s wrong with this?  Nothing.  It&#x27;s perfectly reasonable that every person in the simulation observes aspects of the universe that are unique to them, and them alone.  It meets the &quot;predictive&quot; requirement for science at an individual level, and while it&#x27;s personally reproducible, it&#x27;s not consensually reproducible.  Does that really make it any less real?<p>At least for me, I&#x27;m confident that physicalism is false.  Why?  Because if I were to rank everything I am certain about on a scale of most certain to least certain, at the top of the list would be &quot;I am certain that I am experiencing my own existence&quot;.  I cannot think of anything I am more sure about.  Take away my senses (or manipulate them somehow), but as long as my brain is still functioning and I&#x27;m conscious, I&#x27;m still <i>experiencing</i>.  The universe didn&#x27;t have to be this way.  It could have existed almost like it does now, except that all the people in it would have been philosophical zombies.  (And perhaps all of you are, which would make me a solipsist, but at least I&#x27;m a solipsist that knows I&#x27;m not a p-zombie then.)<p>† My claim that &quot;science is the ability to predict the future&quot; and &quot;better science corresponds to better predictions&quot; is a semantic issue, and a whole debate could center around developing a consensus on good definitions.  Wikipedia lists other attributes of the word &quot;science&quot; in addition to predictability.  If you don&#x27;t like my definition, make up a new word and substitute it for &quot;science&quot;; the argument holds regardless.",1426743015

I&#x27;d love to have a breakdown by ancestry of both countries, but from my own anecdotal experience is is more common to see fair-skinned people in Brazil than in Argentina. (Just going quickly over it in Wikipedia it looks like about 90 million people in Brazil are &#x27;white&#x27;. That&#x27;s double the population of Argentina already.)",1426742037

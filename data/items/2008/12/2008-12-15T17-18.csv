I was a fairly decent student and I met other good students. If you would have stuck and taken the advanced CS classes like AI, Computer Vision, Compiler languages or Operative systems you might have gotten a glimpse of the hackers at GMU. I don't consider myself a hacker, but I do love coding. I never even dreamed of working for Booz Allen, but I don't see anything wrong with that idea either. There were some hackers there though, like the guy who coded and came up with Plasma Pong (it was later shutdown by Atari I think), and I think another guy who wrote RoadBlocks, the math department also had some really smart people. Apart from some Associate professors I think that the CS department has some really outstanding faculty like Sean Luke, Elizabeth White, Zoran Duric and I also heard professor Hamburger was awesome before he retired, I learned a lot from them (actually I never would have learned of hacker news if it wasn't for Professor Luke).",1229363640

398536,comment,398494,398494,0,0,patio11,,,"Useful for a band... perhaps less useful for anyone who can write software.  If you can write software, then you'll make more money writing software than by doing just about anything else.  (Cards on the table: I am automatically skeptical of anybody who suggests ""Programmers should be like musicians"" because I always hear the whispered insinuation ""I should get their stuff like I get my music -- for free"".)<p>I've got a minorly successful blog and people tell me I should go into writing.  I think that's insane: do LOTS of marginal work, collect ~8% of the sales of the book from a pretty small number of people.  Alternatively, do fairly little marginal work to promote my software, and collect 96% of each purchase price.  Which is more than the cost of the book, to boot, because software doesn't have to get sold on some stupid hardcover/softcover basis and then rotated out of the bookstore after 5 months.<p>Software also scales to infinity if you can get the marketing/advertising done right, which is why I make far more from my sideline than from my day job on a per-hour basis despite doing much, much more impressive work at my day job by any technical measurement.<p>Similarly, 37signals has a lot of revenue streams.  They've got several flavors of software, and several flavors of revenue which next to the software are pocket lint.  I mean that in the nicest way possible -- Getting Real probably sold more dollars worth of dead tree than I'll make in the next decade, but in terms of impact on the bottom line, ONE small business buying their medium Basecamp plan for a year equals about SIX HUNDRED books.  (PDFs make for a marginally better business -- then you only have to sell 30 copies.)<p>And you know how big of an audience they would need for advertising to compare with even ~1,000 app subscribers?  Egads, it scarcely bears thinking about.  (And they command premium rates for their advertising, via the Deck.  Most people who think ""Egads, I can't charge money -- I'll give it away for free and make it up on the volume!"" are locking themselves into low-rate CPM and AdWords ads.)<p>The job board is a pretty sweet sideline, as far as things go, but unlike the apps it does not scale to infinity.  After you get past N listings in a month, for N in the two digit region, your users start to hurt each other's experience of the product.<p>(The biggest reason for them to do so many things is to keep their name around so as to convince more people to use their web applications, which is where the lion's share of the money is.)",1229362762

Since PHP allows so many different variations I didnt have to conform to one style but instead developed my own.

It seems like, if those were the main issues, the descent below 8,000 feet would not have shown significantly fewer deaths than above.",1229361024
398497,story,,,1,1,rksprst,"Ask HN: How to implement a custom rating system (with a declining date relevance)?",,"I'm working on a site similar to digg in the respect that users can submit ""stories"".<p>I keep track of how many ""votes"" and ""similar adds"" each item got. Similar adds are defined as two users adding the same ""link"".<p>Here is part of the algorithm (essentially the most important):<p><pre><code>   y = day number 
   sy = number of adds on day y

   ∑ y[1:10]  sy / y
</code></pre>
So basically calculate the number of ""similar adds"" on a specified day and divide by the number of seconds since the content was posted originally. Do this for the past 10 days (as an example).<p>However, I'm not sure how I would go about implementing this with sql.<p>The only way I can think of implementing this is by calculating the number of adds for the past 10 days for each item submitted, which will take forever. (so a sql command with a group by date, where date >= current_date - 9 and then a sum of that).<p>Even if I keep a table that I update once a day (and run the above sql in the background), that will still be ridiculously slow once the database gets large. Plus the rating will be ""outdated"" since it's not live (e.g. breaking news ""items"" will never reach the top).<p>Does anyone have any experience of how to go about doing this?<p>Thanks.<p>(I posted on stack overflow first, but reposted here since thought you guys might have more experience with this topic... http://stackoverflow.com/questions/368369/how-to-implement-a-custom-rating-system-with-a-declining-date-relevance )",1229360986

I think replacing most 200 level data structures courses with a detailed understanding of SQL would be far more useful and a great foundation for understanding the point of data structures.  EX: Indexes and Explain are a great example of cost benefit analysis that has little to do with procedural coding.",1229360712

What natural gas extraction of that variety does is still a new thing waiting to be discovered.

With a smart device you'll end up going and doing <i>something all the time</i>, and you get used to that keeping you going and going through the day. And this means you never stop doing and start being.<p>I don't have a smartphone and I probably won't get one until I need some of its functions desperately enough. I like waiting and doing nothing: it's the time to be, it's time for myself. I never run for the bus or tram or train, instead I walk as if it was waiting for me forever. If it leaves before I hop in, I just consider it some time for not-doing.<p>Actually, this removes the meaning of ""waiting"" and ""pause"". If the ""pause"" doesn't actually break anything in your day then you're not ""waiting"" either. It's just your day, sometimes going forward, something stalling, sometimes going backwards, like a little toy boat whirling along in a stream. There's nothing to pause from and nothing to wait because everything <i>just is</i>.",1345362834

4403508,comment,4402763,4402763,1,0,yason,,,"I've always held the opinion that time is the number of events, realizations, ideas, and new experiences.<p>When you're kid, everything is new from what happens on the sandbox to school to friends to foods to afternoons alone to crossing over your old boundaries in general, in both physical and emotional sense. So much happens in a month that it equals five years for an adult.<p>When you're an adult, much of everything is something you know. The fraction of new things in your life depends on your own activity. Even if you wanted to be on the bleeding edge of life, you generally still have a job and a lot of routines in liferoutines that might not be set by you but will still affect you. And routines and repetition doesn't count.<p>The key to adult time is to realize that the mundane things aren't the same, ever, even though they seem like it. You never know what will happen: there <i>is newness</i> every day, in everything you do, if only you can unlearn to dismiss it.<p>The other paththe path that isn't sustainableis to start reaching for experiences intentionally: after you've climbed all the mountains and dived to the deepest caverns of the waters, done the craziest roller coasters and raced the fastest races, you're still not much more ahead of where you started. Those things can be done <i>for fun</i> but what I'm referring to is the trend of experience-hunting which is a reaction to the pace of finding new things in life that has slowed down since childhood.",1345362367

I was waiting in that line for at least an hour, but it didn't feel that way, because I wasn't <i>waiting</i> in a line. I was reading a paperback book that I had brought with me, in a line. It was only a peculiarity of circumstance that there were long lines of people on either side of me during this whole process, and that my reading session concluded with a needle in my arm.<p>Surprisingly pleasant!

They are basically a webpage with all assets bundled together making them easy to distribute. Except, because a non-streamable format was chosen they can't make the leap to full flash replacements.<p>Even as an extensions or widget, the fact that I can't stream them means I have to wait for them to download entirely before they can be used. I can certainly imagine a Chrome app (game) > 500meg that would be awesome if I could start interacting with as soon as 1-20 meg had been downloaded. That use case though was made harder because a non streamable format was chosen. Instead the app has to download some small boot loader and the manually stream the rest of its assets. With a little more foresight that could have been solved directly by the format chosen.<p>As for tar/gz not being random access. There's nothing preventing implementations from caching locations as the file is downloaded or inserting a file as part of the tar that lists the locations.",1345361972

4403486,comment,4402763,4402763,4,0,ChrisNorstrom,,,"My theory is different. Our brains work like film cameras, the faster the camera is rolling the slower time in the film seems to be going during playback. Because less time has passed since the last frame was captured. The slower the camera is rolling the faster the film seems to get when you play it back. Our perception of time is based on comparing what we last remember while we were conscious with where we are in time currently. This is why daydreaming while driving makes your trip seem a lot shorter.<p>I call this ""Brain Idling"". When we're young our brains have a lot of grey matter and we're addicted to information accumulation, talking, chatting, and being mentally stimulated. As we age we stop learning (no school, no collage, nothing new going on in life), have less grey matter and start going on auto-pilot. When we drive to the store, when we shop for groceries, at work, at home. We've memorized our lives so well we no longer think about what we do, we just naturally do it on auto-pilot and our minds start to ""idle"" a lot more that usual. The film in our camera-like brains is snapping images at a much slower pace. A lot of time is passing between mental snap-shots. So when we look back (playback) the events of the day (all the things we remembered) it feels like time has flown by at light speed.<p>I freaked out over how fast time has flown by after I hit 21 and tried out an experiment. I installed ""talking clock"" for windows on my pc and made it announce the time every 5 minutes. Yes. For the whole day. Every day. After the 2nd day of using this technique time slowed down by massive amounts. A day felt like a week. A week felt like a month. It was insane. I felt like I was young again and the world was moving at a glacial pace. There are downsides of course, it's unsustainable. You have to take breaks every other day or so otherwise you get used to hearing the time and ignore it. It can also get exhausting when your brain can't take a break and daydream or idle and think about nothing. But it does work. I wanted to write a nice big article on it but I'm so swamped by work on projects and new clients needing UI/UX consulting that I just keep putting it off. On the plus side I've discovered a way to slow down time (at least for me).",1345361166

They had just been accepted into YC and had brought one of their original prototypes to the party and were driving it around.<p>It was a prototype, with a rough cut aluminum skeleton and questionable balance, but it was still a goddamn iPad segway, and they were driving it around a crowded space talking to people through the camera. It was awesome.<p>I can't speak to how big the telepresence market is, or how the price point compares, but I wish these guys the best of luck, because while I'm sitting at my desk coding another web application, these guys are building freaking robots.",1345360380

4403454,comment,4400324,4400480,1,0,smsm42,,,"I have lived in a country wil multi-party election system. I am not really sure you'd prefer it to US system if you saw it in action. In multi-party system, one of the ""big"" wins the elections and then has to bargain with smaller parties to create a ruling coalition. This bargaining usually a completely disgusting process of political horse-trading, where narrow-issue parties wield wildly unproportional influence and extract huge concessions due to their political position. This also happens sometimes on narrow votes in US system, but while in US this is more of an exception, in multi-party state this is the only way to go. What is called ""pork barrel spending"" in US and seen as something that should be reduced if not eliminated completely in US is the only way to spend in a good multi-party system, because without buying off smaller parties (which are not shy of outright extortion because they have enough votes to hold small but key position and do not fear to look bad because they don't have to woo independents) no law and no budget can ever pass.<p>I'm not saying any of the systems is best or worst in each case, but multi-party system has as many, if not more, problems than two-party system.",1345360125

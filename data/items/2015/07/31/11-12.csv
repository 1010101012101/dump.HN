I&#x27;ve seen similar advice in the past and can&#x27;t help but recall my personal anecdote of starting a company with barely enough money for one month of expenses. What is far more vital to one&#x27;s success as a solo contractor is not having savings, but having guaranteed future revenue generation – clients with signed contracts.<p>As the author notes, the legal business entity and business infrastructure should be set up in advance. This enables one to acquire clients and do business before putting in a two-week notice at your full time job. I no longer operate my company, but had I abided by the 4 month of living expenses rule I would have never gotten off the ground. Within 4 months I was earning slightly more than double my previous salary. Don&#x27;t shackle yourself to rigid startup rules.

I&#x27;d also point to Hannu Rajaniemi&#x27;s <i>Quantum Thief</i> trilogy, Peter Watts (for world-building -- see below) and the cultural/linguistic side of C. J. Cherryh&#x27;s Foreigner series (at least the first five or so books).<p>One of the less well understood (especially by non-genre reader) aspects of hard SF is that the world the story is set in can be viewed as a character/participant in the plot, or -- in this sub-field -- as a puzzle that the plot depends on; the outcome of the story simply doesn&#x27;t work without the world being set up the way it is. (A lot of stuff is marketed as hard SF that doesn&#x27;t fit this criterion; it just has lots of cheap throwaway references to technology. But the core of the field is about solving the puzzle that the universe has thrown in front of the protagonists.)",1438343249

Your duties are then mainly as follows:<p>Use HMRC PAYE Tools to report each salary payment you make, and pay any National Insurance if applicable (which it won&#x27;t be if you keep you salary below £671 a month).<p>Use the same tool to report any expense payments each May (form P11D).<p>Use Companies House WebFiling to submit your annual return (a short submission confirming some details about your company&#x27;s directors and shareholdings etc.) each company year end.<p>Use HRMC&#x27;s Online services to submit your corporation tax and accounts nine months after each year end.

I suppose you&#x27;ve got to have something of an interest in learning how a business is run to justify it. On the other hand you can save your company a tidy sum, plus as a company director you&#x27;re legally responsible for the accuracy of the various submissions anyway, whether an accountant does it all for you or not, so you may as well have a sound understanding of it all I say. Also, I don&#x27;t know whether this is the really the case or not but I&#x27;ve a theory that the more you run your operation like a proper business the less likely you&#x27;re going to come a cropper of an IR45 disguised employment judgement, which could be severely financially damaging.<p>Running your own operation like this will put you in a better position for trying out any side projects I believe, and of course it will all stand you in good stead when you finally hit on the world changing idea you&#x27;ve been waiting for and your one man band blossoms into a large corporation (although do then get some accountants - but at least you&#x27;ll have some idea what they&#x27;re up to).",1438341856

There&#x27;s the one you mention, and there&#x27;s a different approach that you&#x27;ll see here and in other books like Learn You a Haskell for Great Good, Brave Clojure, and perhaps most famously, why&#x27;s (poignant) Guide to Ruby.<p>I think that there&#x27;s a place for both of these styles in the world. And perhaps this style can appeal to a person who struggles with the stereotype of computer programming as a serious, dry affair, bereft of human expression, the job of coder cogs in programming factories. Perhaps you could say that the serious style appeals to more people, but maybe that is actually a criticism of the population of programmers, and not of the work?<p>In regards to sounding childish, I find that in general to be an unusual criticism. Perhaps there are people who speak this way as adults simply because that is who they are? I guess C.S. Lewis sums up my feelings about &quot;being childish&quot;:<p>Critics who treat &#x27;adult&#x27; as a term of approval, instead of as a merely descriptive term, cannot be adult themselves. To be concerned about being grown up, to admire the grown up because it is grown up, to blush at the suspicion of being childish; these things are the marks of childhood and adolescence. And in childhood and adolescence they are, in moderation, healthy symptoms. Young things ought to want to grow. But to carry on into middle life or even into early manhood this concern about being adult is a mark of really arrested development. When I was ten, I read fairy tales in secret and would have been ashamed if I had been found doing so. Now that I am fifty I read them openly. When I became a man I put away childish things, including the fear of childishness and the desire to be very grown up.",1438341627

If you look at the gradual process of state consolidation in Europe since the Industrial Revolution, you&#x27;ll see a pattern of changes in law that were done in the interest of expanding trade interests. Places like Italy or Germany <i>had to integrate</i> if they wanted to compete with states that could better exploit industrial economies of scale. Economic interests were powering national movements in most countries.<p>Now this process is happening at a higher scale. We are moving towards a fully-integrated system where industrial interests can reach the farthest corners of the world. It has to be expected that they would drive legislation towards harmonization. In fact, in some ways this is a good thing: if European companies can compete with US ones on a level playing field, it&#x27;s better for everyone.<p>The problem is that political representatives are not properly exploiting this historical chance. These compromises are being done &quot;towards the bottom&quot; of available choices, consistently choosing options that would reduce rights and quality of life of average people on all sides. EU single-market integration was a similar process, and has delivered improved standards in many areas of life (note: I&#x27;m not talking about the Euro, but EU-wide regulation on safety, worker rights and so on); TPP looks like a simple money grab, a rush towards dismantling what is left of European-style welfare.<p>This is doubly disappointing because this sort of chance doesn&#x27;t come along every year or even every generation.",1438341551

Apple got very paternalistic towards their users and this has always manifested in what they <i>allow</i> you to do with <i>their</i> devices. iOS has always had limitations, being defective by design. And so Apple&#x27;s customers ultimately end up choosing something else, or end up believing that Apple&#x27;s actions are for their own good. And Android is in many ways iOS&#x27;s opposite.<p>What really bothers me is that people feel the need to defend their choice, their investment and so they end up believing things and adopting an apologetic attitude just for the sake of thinking about their favorite company as being the good guys.

I buy Apple products because they appear more integrated and polished than other consumer tech, and that is an important aspect of my personality.

10954794,comment,10953349,10953623,0,0,lkrubner,,,"You have never seen HTML used to build something that a human might look at? What are you looking at right now? Aren&#x27;t you looking at a web page? Aren&#x27;t you human? Aren&#x27;t you using your eyes to see what I&#x27;ve written? Unless you &quot;View Source&quot; on every page you visit, you are looking at the GUI, not the structured information.<p>If you think HTML can be used to send structured information, I would urge to read the essay that Mark Pilgrim wrote in 2004. I posted the link before.<p>Also, please consider all the many arguments that Sam Ruby has made against HTML-as-structured-data. From 2005 forward, there were many people who wanted HTML5 to be an extension of XHTML, but as Sam Ruby kept asking &quot;Why should we call something XML if it is clearly not XML?&quot; Over the years, in his role as co-Chair of the W3C working group, he kept making the point that &quot;draconian error checking&quot; is part of the XML spec, and it can not be reconciled to people&#x27;s actual use of the Web. That is why HTML5 relaxed all the rules regarding validation and structure.<p>This is Sam Ruby in 2009:<p>&quot;So, while I doubt that I will ever understand why there are people who insist on calling their pages they produce with the intention of being processed as HTML by the name “XHTML”, I can’t deny that there clearly is something that such people want.  (By way of comparison, I am quite happy to say that this page is served as XHTML to browsers that support such, and as HTML to browsers that don’t).  From my experience, this is tricky stuff, and not something that should be recommended lightly.)&quot;<p><a href=""http://intertwingly.net/blog/2009/07/19/Humpty-Dumpty"" rel=""nofollow"">http://intertwingly.net/blog/2009/07/19/Humpty-Dumpty</a>",1453489171

10954784,comment,10951220,10952462,0,0,ewindisch,,,"> It&#x27;s rare to see a kernel-bug that can&#x27;t be worked around in some way other than patching.<p>While it&#x27;s true that most critical bugs I&#x27;ve run into with the kernel can be workaround in some way, it&#x27;s at the detriment to some use-case that some users, somewhere rely upon.<p>A vulnerability I discovered a bit of a year ago allowed local privilege escalation for any user with access to write to an XFS filesystem. The only workarounds were to modify their SELinux policies or switch to another filesystem. I&#x27;m not aware of any users that rewrote their SELinux policies for this. It had been fixed in the kernel and fairly quietly fixed in a RedHat security advisory, but I don&#x27;t think any other distribution did anything at all.<p>I&#x27;d estimate that critical kernel bugs happen at least other month. Worse, discussion of these bugs happens in the public and takes dozens of months to fix. Again, assuming you even know of these vulnerabilities, while there are often workarounds, they&#x27;re not always practical.<p>Did you know that via user namespaces, all non-root users on a machine can elevate to a root user? That root user is supposed to be limited, but it&#x27;s allowed the mount syscall. Numerous vulnerabilities have been discovered as a result of this. The kernel team usually considers them low-impact and they get a low CVSS score, but when using certain applications this can lead to local privilege escalation. The workarounds are to disable user namespaces or disable mount for user namespaces, both of which will break some set of users.<p>Did you know that any user capable of creating a socket can load kernel modules? For a long time this allowed loading ANY kernel module! The only workarounds were to compile it out of the kernel or monkeypatch the kernel. Only last year was this was finally fixed upstream so only those modules patching a pattern were loading. Yet, it was also discovered that if you used busybox&#x27;s modprobe, the filter would still allow non-root users to load arbitrary kernel modules from anywhere on the filesystem!<p>Point being, this is par for the course. Clearly one needs to understand their threat model, but if the model is at all worried about local privilege escalation, update weekly until you find another OS.",1453489114

The continuation of the third passage I quoted explains why they think that several of the advantages of unikernels disappear if you try writing things in not-OCaml. It looks like the instructions you&#x27;re linking is intended for third-party libraries that already exist in C, not for entire applications (although, yes, that would work).<p>I mean, you also can port applications to Linux kernelspace. (Remember the Tux web server?) But that&#x27;s not really the point of Linux, and if you want that, you should... use a unikernel.<p>That said, sure, it&#x27;s entirely possible that as they shift focus from an academic project to a commercial one, they&#x27;ll give up on this distinction and its performance advantages, and start marketing a product that lets you just write C. (Just like they may well give up on hypervisor-based parallelism and add fork().) But that&#x27;s not how they&#x27;re currently envisioning the concept.",1453489105

If you really need to support legacy systems, mandoc can convert man pages written in mdoc to man.<p>Please don&#x27;t write man pages in Docbook or anything that relies on Docbook for man page output.  I&#x27;ve had so many issues with xmlto and xsltproc and Docbook.  Really, mdoc is very simple and writing it by hand is not a big deal.  Modern man page processors can also produce HTML or PDF output, so don&#x27;t worry about that.  I&#x27;m sad that I&#x27;ve had to pull in such a heavyweight and complicated toolchain that doesn&#x27;t even work half the time just to generate some tiny man pages.",1453488702

We have to ease society into this transition, and just like we shouldn&#x27;t give the BI in one lump yearly sum(especially since most basic income proposals include almost completely gutting other safety nets) we shouldn&#x27;t make perverse incentives to collect additional BI by neglecting their children.<p>Maybe for the first 20 years of the program every child affords a parent some additional BI based on the child&#x27;s age. Raising a child when health care is inexpensive(my vision of BI does include pretty much free health care), job&#x27;s are optional, and schooling is free makes the most expensive times to be early in the child&#x27;s life when they are constantly outgrowing their clothing and beds and using up diapers at an impressive rate.<p>Eventually the amount of BI awarded becomes sufficient for most family situations(Star Trek post-scarcity style) or other factors like perfect birth control allow us to remove the child BI bonus.",1453488112

Unikernels are single-purpose appliances that are compile-time specialised into standalone kernels, and sealed against modification when deployed to a cloud platform. In return they offer significant reduction in image sizes, improved efficiency and security, and should reduce operational costs. Our Mirage prototype compiles OCaml code into\nunikernels that run on commodity clouds and offer an order of magnitude reduction in code size without significant performance penalty.<p>> An important decision is whether to support multiple languages within the same unikernel. [...] The alternative is to eschew source-level compatibility and\nrewrite system components entirely in one language and specialise that toolchain as best as possible. [...] existing non-OCaml code can be encapsulated in separate VMs and communicated with via message-passing [...]<p>> We did explore applying unikernel techniques in the traditional systems language, C, linking application code with Xen MiniOS, a cut-down libc, OpenBSD versions of libm and printf, and the lwIP user-space network stack.<p>That is, there is absolutely a single language constraint, on purpose, as arguably the primary differentiation from non-unikernels.",1453488087

What people observe with Rc and RefCell is that you do indeed get back your freedom to make aliases and mutate at will, but you still have to know how the borrow checker works.

Look through their site with fresh eyes: If you were designing a news website (rather than moving a newspaper to this new platform), how many design, UI and functionality choices would you make differently?<p>A quick start:<p>* The separation of different forms of content: They don&#x27;t really mix text with video, images and graphics, even though most web-native bloggers will do it. They seem to lack fluency with mixing media; it&#x27;s a project for them. They&#x27;ll staple a video and decorate text with images and graphics, but they don&#x27;t really commuicate with it; they don&#x27;t say, &#x27;here&#x27;s how Clinton responded to Sanders:&quot; <video>, or, &#x27;here was the scene when the earthquake struck&#x27; <video>, or even in a movie review, here&#x27;s what the scene looks like: <video> or <image>. Instead, they try to describe the visual with text. Even explanatory graphics are a separate, special production, on a separate page.<p>* The font in their title: Back when printing fancy fonts was a technological feat, this font communicated that they were serious and sophisticated. Now, if you step back and ignore the history, it looks like a kid playing with fonts. (Look at it this way: would you <i>ever</i> use that font on a website you were designing?). It says, insists even: We&#x27;re anchored to the paper age and will never let go. We&#x27;re the old, dying generation. If you want something new, go elsewhere.<p>* The discoverability of content: Obviously mimicing a newspaper, but a bad choice for the web. How many links are on that home page (scroll down)? And even more content doesn&#x27;t even appear there. All that hard work and content, unlikely ever to be found, buried and lost forever. It&#x27;s tragic.  But that&#x27;s what they did in the hard copy newspaper so I guess it&#x27;s ok.<p>* Also, where are stories updated since I visited a couple hours ago? Oh look, if I look at every link a red &#x27;updated&#x27; indicator is next to some links (just like the web 20 years ago!), which I see if I examine every one of them (and how do I identify brand new links in this massive page of links?) - but where in this multi-page story are the new parts? I guess I&#x27;ll just re-read the whole thing.<p>I say this all out of love. They are an very important institution. The news business is hard enough; stop handicapping yourselves! From the outside they look like they still, in 2015, haven&#x27;t fully embraced the new technology.

10954480,comment,10950875,10954092,0,0,muddyrivers,,,"I doubt it. Here are my thoughts.<p>At the beginning level, players must learn and memorize a large number of Dingshi, which means fixed patterns. Their scopes are small, restricted to less than 30 cross points, if my memory serves right. They mostly happen in the corners or close to the borders, which helps greatly reduce the complexity. If one masters these Dingshi, s/he can easily beat ~90% players based on my experience. This part of the game can be done easily by computers.<p>The next level is to develop skills or feels to identify Xing, which refers to larger patterns. They are still constrained to a small area, like 1/8 ~ 1/6 of the whole board. They are further away from the corners and the boarders. So the complexity increases dramatically. Most players of intermediate level can feel if a Xing is good or not, but not many of them knows why. So s/he develops the intuition, but not the actual skills and insights. That means, if two Xings can be developed from the current state and both feel good, they can&#x27;t tell which is better in most cases. In reality, there could be dozens of good Xings developed from the current state, and one also needs to consider the potential moves of the opponents. Due to the complexity, the vast majority of players can&#x27;t go beyond this level no matter how hard they work on. It is like it requires a combination of talent, personality and hard work to become a top mathematician or a NBA starter.<p>The next level requires one&#x27;s skills and insights to understand Shi, which includes strategy of the whole game, potential, etc. It is to develops the skills and feeling on the whole board. It is to develop accurate calculation on the potential covering area of the existing stones and how strong the potential is. It asks the questions that how synergetic are two regions of your stones , although they may look far apart at present. At this level, players pay great attention to the beginning stage of the game. The board is vastly empty, so the complexity is the highest. The potential gains or losses can be huge. One must consider the opponent&#x27;s playing history to take fully advantage. It happens often to the players who enter the early stage of this level that they realized in the later stages of the game that one stone should have been placed one position left or right or higher. This initial stage is called Buju.<p>I think computers can get to the second level but it looks very hard to get to the third level in the next 10 years. Keep in mind that there are big differences in term of one&#x27;s skills and insights even within the highest levels. For amateur players and low level professionals, they are way beyond their understanding. Even it is explained a move would be better if placed just one spot left, they wouldn&#x27;t understand it.",1453486436

The linguisitic construction might survive to serve a different purpose later though. Even now I see people mimicking it to convey a certain type of sarcasm (and I suspect almost everyone who uses it is at least somewhat sarcastic about it).<p>But the point that trjordan brings up in their top-level comment, &quot;Figuring out ways to invent slang so it cleanly translates to written text is pretty hard,&quot; gets closer to the core observation, which is that the new phenomenon of informal written communication transmitted in small chunks (IM and tweets, mostly) will have, and already has had, a profound impact on language.<p>Another observation: I spoken communication I try to avoid phrases like &quot;to be honest,&quot; &quot;if I recall correctly,&quot; etc. because they should be implied: &quot;to be honest&quot; only indicates that previously you may have been lying, and &quot;if I recall correctly&quot; insults your correspondant&#x27;s ability listen to you critcically — of course &quot;if you recall correctly,&quot; everything is &quot;if you recall correctly.&quot; But in IM, dropping an extra &quot;tbh&quot; or &quot;iirc&quot; or &quot;idk&quot; into your message changes the inflection of the message, and in a medium so devoid of inflection, that small change can significantly impact meaning. Such phrases are the part of the &quot;body language&quot; of textual communication.<p>And I notice these communication spilling over into spoken communication. When I speak with somebody now, especially if I usually communicate with them over text, &quot;to be honests&quot; abound!<p>I predict that in 50 years we&#x27;ll see that instant messaging has transformed human communication more than the telephone or printing press ever did.

Speaking to other humans in real life maps perfectly to ideation, generating that into text, and then uploading it to a website that has a 160char limit. Speaking requires a lot of effort because not only do you think of what you want to say, but then you have to <i>verbalize it</i>.<p>Online, people obviously have to do the first part, but it is so much <i>easier</i> to then find all of the keys associated with an individual word and input them on the per sentence basis, plus you get to include proper punctuation and additional characters which makes this way easier.<p>This article is super interesting. Language hasn&#x27;t evolved or changed (even slightly) in the preceding hundred years. It&#x27;s really weird to think we have been using the same language that came out of Egypt in 2690 b.c. In fact, we still use the same hieroglyphs that adorned the walls of the great pyramid of Giza.<p>It is pretty amazing if you think about it. From cave paintings, to papyrus scrolls and eventually to Gutenberg&#x27;s PP, shit even with the digital communications and texting in the 80&#x27;s and 90&#x27;s, language has stayed the same.<p>If this language was good enough for Shakespeare, millenials, the people who often pick up the physical Washington Times everyday, should think twice before foraging on with these nonsensical changes.<p>Also, the world is more closed now than ever, so ideas often spread slower. Which makes this even more astounding!",1453486028

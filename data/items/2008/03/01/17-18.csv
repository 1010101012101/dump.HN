With a brief introduction to Basic in school, and some programming classes in undergrad, I graduated with a Bachelors in Production Engineering, and it was after that I realized that computers (and programming) is where I felt just right. I worked on my first major (Java) project in grad school when I was 21. Haven't looked back since and over the years have learned several languages.<p>I will admit though, that a)starting late b)not having a formal education in computer sciences is a little frustrating at times. I spend my evenings trying to play catch up with those who had a head start (reading up on compilers, language design, even SICP). Don't get me wrong, I am still as fascinated with computers as I was 8 years ago (I turn 30 today, the 1st actually), but every time I read a brilliant comment on a language or a framework on YC News, I know I have a long way to go before I will have that level of competence and understanding.<p>To answer your question, I don't think its never too late to pursue your passion. In the long run, when you look back, you would rather see having spent time doing things you loved to do, rather than spending a majority of your life as a zombie, in pursuit of a paycheck than anything else.<p>From another late starter, I can only wish you the very best.",1204394392

That was great when I had a ton of time to sit and browse through it all. But I'm growing up and trying be become a better programmer, trying to start some projects that take off, and in general no matter if I'm working at my day job or on my startup at home, trying to keep a good solid work ethic. When I need a break or I'm bored I browse HN and not only find things that interest me, but find things that help me work towards my goals.",1204393958

I mostly stick to proggramming.reddit. Hacker news IMO should be edited to keep it going down the reddit road. Not to bash on reddit, if I want to see stupid pictures or read or post politic news thats where I go, but HN filters out a lot of noise. I'm thankful for that.",1204393695

There's just no incentive for hackers to do any of their Windows work on Vista compared to XP.<p>Apple provided incentive to move to Leopard in the form of Ruby and Python bindings and some slick new dev tools.  Vista?  Eh... why bother?  What can you do on Vista that you can't do on XP?  Flip 3D?  No thanks.<p>(Honestly, though, if there are any good reasons to develop on Vista I'd be open to hearing about them)",1204393652

126739,comment,126540,126540,0,0,pauljonas,,,"Eh, matters arn't as simple as portrayed - a good bit of U.S. application support/development has went overseas to India... ...within a short 15 minute drive of my home in Arizona, I can tally thousands of programming jobs (mostly old school COBOL + CICS type work, but not limited to, as tons of Java and web developer slots too were affected) that went overseas. Departments comprised of 200+ employees (plus additional U.S. contracted programmers) now are skeleton crews that manage a blend of offshore and non-immigrant Visa workers that work at company facilities on-site or in special facilities here in U.S..<p>But in 5+ years time, the Indian programmers become the system subject matter experts as the few remaining U.S. workers mark the days until retirement. There are few young U.S. workers waiting in the wings, and any American who has opted for a career in programming has chosen something more ""sexier"", like working with Rails or as a web developer, even if the pay is a fraction of what a developer could make 15-20 years ago working with such ""old school"" mainframe technology...<p>But those systems are still running, every time you use a credit card, book a flight, use electricity, etc..., the ""main nerve center"" system that accommodates such transactions is still going to be a COBOL system with a DB2 (or even worse, an ancient hierarchical IBM IMS database)...",1204392952

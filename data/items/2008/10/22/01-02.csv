On the media side of things Google is not a serious competitor.<p>That Yahoo can't monetize the search impressions they do get as well as Google (and thus would benefit from Google monetization deal) is purely a technical execution failure for Yahoo engineering and executives.  To this day you can't take an export from Google AdWords account and import it in Yahoo. They say you can, but their SEM system is not powerful enough to support anything nontrivial.",1224640760

To say that college athletes are unpaid workers isn't exactly true, but it also isn't entirely honest to say they're paid like a regular job.

339618,comment,339473,339473,0,0,bigthboy,,,"From my personal perspective, I'm half expecting Yahoo to end up just like AOL.  A subsidiary of a media conglomerate that is just used when making bad jokes and referencing the past.  Their current position definitely indicates this, and I'm talking both on the internal company side of things (in terms of products, innovation, and market reach) and on the public side of things (shares).<p>I can't help but feel that Yahoo! signed its own death certificate when they so loudly fought off Microsoft's handsome buyout offer.  Would Yahoo have taken this offer, at least Yahoo would have the potential to still exist and be recognized.  It would've been interesting to see how it played out.  In a round about way, we can even look at Yahoo as a modern Netscape... they stood up to Microsoft and bit the bullet in the end.<p>AOL is probably most remembered for their annoying ""Free Dial-Up Internet Trial"" CDs in the mail that were more cumbersome than spam, what is Yahoo going to be remembered for?",1224639132

A company I know has been selling a desktop application for a while, successfully and profitably.  They're now considering moving it to the Web.  From what I've seen, this makes a heckuva lot of sense, from both the technical and business perspectives.<p>However, I'm a bit stuck for examples of applications that have successfully made such a transition, and was hoping to get some insights from others here.  FedEx moved from PC-based tracking software to the Web, and seems to have done well as a result.  Banks have also abandoned PC-based software in favor of the Web.  Adobe has ported Photoshop to the Web, but I'm not sure if it's really comparable, or if they're making real money from it.  I'm also unsure of how many people use Intuit's Web-based software, rather than their desktop apps.<p>So, can you think of any good examples of companies that successfully made this transition?

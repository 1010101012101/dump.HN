5207958,comment,5206211,5207717,1,0,metaphorm,,,"I agree. Separation of concerns is a very good design pattern. MVC server frameworks (like Rails and Django) have already separated out the concern of displaying data to the user with their template systems. its a very reasonable next step to just migrate the entire template system off the server and let the client do it.<p>This has gigantic performance increases for servers under heavy load, and it puts the display logic in a domain that is more naturally suited to dealing with it (JavaScript and the DOM instead of treating HTML as just a string).<p>The pattern also promotes the use of RESTful APIs for data access from the server, which has the wonderful bonus of allowing you to make your data publicly accessible for free if you want to.",1360688327

5207931,comment,5204423,5207702,1,0,mpyne,,,"> I think it raises a pretty reasonable point: Why do we even have prisons at all, other than as detention facilities for pending death penalty cases? If someone commits a sufficiently serious crime (or re-offends sufficiently many times), put them to death.<p>That's a great insight.<p>I would point out that prison is still an acceptable in-between for community service and <i>death</i>. E.g. what happens if the convict simply doesn't show up for their community service?<p>Depriving someone of their own free use of their time is a powerful motivational tool (just ask anyone who's ever had to ""hurry up and wait"" in the military).<p>However any possible positive effect you would get from prison, either for rehabilitation or non-recurrence, would be had within the first year, two at the most.<p>Any prison sentence beyond that and you have to wonder what the marginal additional value is (I would think none).<p>I'm not sure if you're entirely serious about the death penalty for sufficiently serious crimes, but the normal argument is that even if that were acceptable in theory, that it's been proven not implementable <i>in practice</i>, and we'd rather optimize for not accidentally putting something to death who is innocent.<p>This itself could be fleshed out further though... governments all the times do things (or don't do things) that may indirectly lead to fatalities later on. Things as simple as redirecting a road away from a cliff face to prevent people from driving over the edge at night can save lives, but we as a population generally accept that there is an economic reality that government can't pay to completely prevent all foreseeable accidents. So could you argue from there that if we already let people drive off of cliffs because it's cheaper, that we could let government accidentally execute innocents if it had a net positive outcome?<p>I don't know... even I'm pretty leery of that logic. Personally if I were to be fradulently convicted I'd rather a lifetime of prison than to be put to death (assuming I could still read, program, etc.)",1360688024

5207919,comment,5206555,5207126,2,0,coldtea,,,"><i>1. You say ""instead"", as if this were a choice between two alternatives. This is known as the ""false dilemma"", and it is a logical fallacy.</i><p>Logical fallacies are perfectly fine in some contexts. I ""appeal to authority"" every time I listen to my doctor instead of my friend's intuition without even checking what my friend said. Given insufficient time, you pretty much have too. You cannot check everything by yourself. Authority itself was established as a means of offloading some fact checking to the other's expertise. A doctor's degree DOES provide some assurance, it's not just an empty title.<p>That digression aside, the same thing applies here. What you call ""false dilemma"", I call a priority. In every situation, given limited resources, you get to make choices and compromises. If your house is on fire you don't stop to mow the lawn. You put the fire off.<p>><i>2. It is not clear how to fix the problem about discrimination based on names on CVs/rsums, whereas the solution to bikinis in powerpoint slides is much simpler (delete the pictures from the slides, smartass). To use a much abused phrase, this is low-hanging fruit.</i><p>The problem with low-hanging fruit is that they give you a false sense of accomplishment. In optimising code, the easy 1% fix doesn't mean anything if there is a slow function taking 60% of the call times.<p>Plus, there's an assumption that bikini slides are a problem. Unequal pay is a real problem with real consequences. Bikini slides is merely something that offends some prudes and that some people don't like, not the real issue with sexism. We see naked and half-naked men and women everyday, in TV, in the Movies, on the net, in ads, everywhere. Suddenly it's too much in a presentation? I think this is more about the separation between work/life (a protestant ideological remnant) than anything else. A notion that the workplace should not be sexy/playful/political/etc.<p>><i>3. You also assume that the issues are unrelated or isolated, and that (for example) showing inappropriate pictures of women at tech conferences does not cause people to discriminate against women on CVs/rsums, when it is very plausible that the pictures of women in bikinis normalize / contribute to the measurable acts of discrimination.</i><p>Very plausible? That is as far fetched idea as any I've ever heard. At the very least, citation needed.<p>><i>Would anyone raise even an eyebrow if a woman sliped a sexy male model photo in a slide?\n>>You think this is a clever argument, but it is not. Let me illustrate for you a better analogy.</i><p>So my argument (with exactly the same situation as the one complained about) is not good, because I couldn't (theoretically) stand an entirely different situation that you describe?<p>Let's see your analogy for a moment. For one thing: I AM constantly bombarded by pictures of men who ""made it"". Especially in HN, it's all too easy to see people bragging about acquisitions and 6-figure salaries. And there ARE women that are attracted to that kind of thing, and wouldn't give a poor guy the eye. Just as you describe.<p>Now, what does this has to do with the situation? Is a bikini slide meant to mean ""lose 50 pounds""? Or ""women in the audience should look like these""?<p>If I showed a picture of Simon Peyton Jones would that equally imply ""programmers in the audience have to be as smart as him else you are losers""? If I show Marc Zuckenberg or some other successful enterpreneur does that mean ""Less than 1 billion net worth is for suckers""? Would anyone even think of it that way?<p>><i>Sexism is not a simple problem and you do not help anything by imagining what it would by like if a woman put sexy pictures of a man on a powerpoint slide. Fact is, men are not generally worried about getting raped.</i><p>Where's the equality then? Or is having different arbitrary demands for each gender acceptable?",1360687883

Its something you can never give back.  No matter what.  It can never be deleted.  And you know this when you are making the acquisition.""<p>There is not other way to signal to the developer that the software is not what you thought it was. For instance, I purchased a note-taking app from the App Store last night that turned out to not be what I needed. There was no way of knowing this beforehand because there is no free version that I could test and pirating it would have been way more trouble than it's worth (plus, I'm not doing that anymore).<p>So, what's the reasonable solution? For physical goods, if I'm unhappy with the purchase, I can return the item and receive a refund. For software, there is no good return method.<p>Now, one could argue that it's only a $10 app, but that isn't the point. The point is that $10 paid for something that I don't want or need, and while $10 probably isn't much to me, it should not be yours because your product failed to meet my needs.<p>As for the rest of the post, the purchaser in that case <i>was</i> out of line.

In other words, taking the plea would have had the additional cost to his integrity, which even in this day and age still means a lot to some people.<p>I don't know if I would go so far as to say that the decision was rational (and I know the suicide prevention people hate it when people talk about stuff like this), but I can see the road he took to get there. Being human isn't always rational and we have to make policies under the understanding that people will have feelings and principles rather than making all decisions as rational automatons.<p>>Would that it were--we'd save a fortune on federal prisoners by executing them all!<p>No we wouldn't. It costs more to execute someone than imprison them because of the cost of all the appeals and safeguards we have for death penalty cases.<p>But even though you're kidding, I think it raises a pretty reasonable point: Why do we even have prisons at all, other than as detention facilities for pending death penalty cases? If someone commits a sufficiently serious crime (or re-offends sufficiently many times), put them to death. If their crime was less serious than that, make them pay back their ill gotten gains, subject them to a fine or make them do community service 20 hours a week for however many hours or years. What good does it do to imprison someone if you ever intend to let them back out again? Prison costs the state money, it takes the convicts out of the economy and makes them parasites, and when they get out they have no skills and no job history which is one of the many reasons the recidivism rate is so high. Prison is a profoundly broken institution. I think there is a very strong argument for just getting rid of it as a method of punishment.",1360685943

You don't need to push a build when a webview changes.<p>* Document-style layout, as mentioned above.<p>* Higher density. We found it easier to show more information on the screen with HTML/CSS than the native controls. Looking at other apps out there makes me think it's an attribute of the medium, not just us.<p>* No need to sync data or duplicate logic.

If you're Christians and think the Jewish rejected the messiah, then you can charge interest to Jews  except there aren't very many, so you won't be able to make a living.<p>Another part of the medieval stereotype I think came from Jewish cultural emphasis on literacy so good Jewish boys could read the Torah.

Software drivers already do some basic EEPROM checks on this hardware (I know because I've had to tweak them); I'm simply suggesting these checks go a little further to verify the various EEPROM settings than could potentially result in a scenario like this one. When the effects are as significant as they are here I hope we can all agree: more sanity checking is a good thing.",1360685224

GWT and the others could be options for that project, depending on requirements.  Only OP knows, but worth suggesting.<p><i>>And after all is said and done, if you had wanted to develop the site in Java, you could have just used J2EE.</i><p>Yup, as I mentioned.<p><i>>You'll never find another developer who wants to maintain your Haskell code.</i><p>That's an absolute with which I absolutely I beg to differ.<p><i>>I would also add Revel, for Golang, to that list.</i><p>Looks interesting, but not mature enough yet to include it in this answer.  And when they say 'modeled on the Play framework', that's a yellow flag to me, given that Play wasn't designed from scratch for strong security.  Originally Play was easily vulnerable to basic attacks like XSS and later patched - eg, <i>not</i> designed around security from scratch.  They seemed to want to build a better Rails on the JVM, but they seem to have also adopted the Rails community's preference for 'cool, quick, easy, and magic with security bolted on later', and just added 'fast'.

At that point you are simply moving the braking from the brake pads/rotors which are designed for it to the clutch disk/friction material... which is definitely not designed for it.<p>Engine braking works well when you rev-match as you downshift, then when in the lower gear simply let off the gas completely. You will slow down, and at that point your drive/axle is pretty much directly connected to the engine which is simply turning without gas being injected into it, thus using the compression cycle to slow you down.<p>In a manual car you don't want to shift to 1st gear when you are driving 100.

Ads targeted towards women use other women to try and sell you the product so you can achieve what the ad represents the woman having.<p>In both cases, the ads are alienating. In male gaze ads women are explicitly not desired except as an object, so there's a very direct alienation there.

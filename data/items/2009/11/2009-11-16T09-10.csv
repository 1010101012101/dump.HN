944232,comment,944040,944040,0,0,wisty,,,"You just learnt interfaces? Those are in Java, C++, Python (2.6+) and any other OO language you care to mention.<p>I don't use C#, so I'm not sure what Linq is exactly, but it seems to be similar to an ORM with baked in transactions. Lots of languages have ORM layers, and they will have some similarities with Linq. If I recall correctly, Erlang does this quite nicely with it's database system.<p>Anyway, most of the techniques and pattens you learn will be widely applicable. Vendors will often claim that they are special (by cooking up new terms for old technologies), but it's usually just the same old features with a new sticker.<p>.Net looks like it's innovating because it's new, but it's mostly pretty conservative. The whole ""cross language platform"" thing is cool, but that's it.<p>Remember the lessons DCOM, COM+, and CORBA. Not all the new bandwagons are worth jumping on.",1258365326

944225,comment,943919,943919,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Note to Microsoft: when a top-tier competitor snaps up your recently discarded ""trash"" employees, perhaps that's a prime indication you made a mistake.<p>I don't know what's going on with the top leadership at MS but there doesn't appear to be much. They've done some good technical work (Win7 for example), but they keep making huge missteps. Windows Mobile is a train wreck. Bing was a step in the right direction, away from the horrific Live search, but MS has already started patting themselves on the back instead of buckling down for the remaining hard work it'll take for them to make bing better than google. MS is quietly bumbling into becoming a dilbert company, if they continue on this path at some point they will hemorrhage talent at an unsustainable rate and find themselves a company of increasingly diminishing relevance and prospects.",1258364807

944223,comment,943879,944164,0,0,dkersten,,,"You can redirect I/O in Clojure, so you possibly can spit/slurp things other than files. I was sure you could use <i>with-input-stream</i> and <i>with-output-stream</i> but I don't see it now.. oh well. Anyway, this (taken from Wikipedia) works with standard I/O and I can only assume ti works with file I/O too (if not, then I agree this is a flaw in the Clojure library design):<p><pre><code>    (def bit-bucket-writer
      (proxy [java.io.Writer] []
        (write [buf] nil)
        (close []    nil)
        (flush []    nil)))
 
    (defmacro noprint
      ""Evaluates the given expressions with all printing to *out* silenced.""
      [& forms]
      `(binding [*out* bit-bucket-writer]
         ~@forms))
 
    (noprint
     (println ""Hello, nobody!""))
</code></pre>
In any case, I see nothing wrong with having these things part of the library. Sure, you could write them yourself, but everyones busy these days, so common tasks should come packaged with the language in the form of a standard library. This is one thing that attracted me to Clojure - an extensive library (and even more so if you count the Java libraries that you get with it, at little extra effort).",1258364646

I know that for the foreseeable future, I'll be working with the MS Stack as it's my means of living. Of course, if they stick with what works and don't deviate from the norm too much - it would be much easier for me to spend time to learning something like Lisp (as someone had mentioned) or digging into another platform or language as you've suggested.<p>I did sign up for the iPhone Dev Program and buy an iPod Touch at the same time the Dev Program launched, but stress at my previous job left little motivation for me to program in my free time. My dev license/subscription ran out and I sold my iPod a while back, but perhaps it's time to revisit it or the Android platform.<p>I definitely have some options and some stuff to think about.

944203,comment,943910,943910,0,0,yason,,,"Disclaimer: This is just my opinion, vaguely based on my experiences, and there are probably counter-examples that proove me wrong in certain circumstances.<p>Memory footprint is very much of a concern not because we wouldn't have memory -- we do -- but because we still have disks that maybe fast by the 90's standards. And all that bloat gets partially loaded to memory at some point or another. And offloaded to swap or discarded, and then again loaded when needed. Disks kill performance.<p>And if you do anything complicated with your computer you'll end up to the disks eventually, if not for anything else that Linux kernel favors I/O buffers by default so a big file copy can turn much of your running image dirty.<p>That's why it can take seconds to start up a Firefox or a half a minute to start Ubuntu. You can speed that up with hacks but it doesn't cure the underlying reason.<p>I think the magnitude of the problem is pretty much revealed in the blog post where RES-SHR for gnome-terminal is a whopping 9 megabytes. How the FSCK can a simple terminal possibly waste 9 megabytes of actual memory? Why the hell does my Nautilus process that is effectively doing nothing but display a few fancy icons on my desktop consume 12 megabytes of memory?<p>I'm not kidding. There's no reason we couldn't have a system that boots to full desktop in less than a second. There's no reason we couldn't have these programs take tens of kilobytes in size, eating at most hundreds of kilobytes of memory -- with the same user experience. We just need to scoop up all program data in one big disk read and then unleash our horde of 3GHz CPU cores at them.<p>I sometimes wonder how much faster a Linux desktop would be if it was compiled with -Os rather than -O2/-O3. The CPU speed isn't the bottleneck, a typical Ubuntu desktop does nothing CPU intensive. I suspect that even a high-level bytecode environment would probably increase the responsiveness of the system in spite of being interpreted because the program code would take less space and fit better in caches.<p>It's NOT all right to dismiss this as a non-problem just because we have loads of RAM.",1258362740

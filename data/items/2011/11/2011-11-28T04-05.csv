By doing so, not only do we hurt the bright kids by boring them to tears, but we presume based on test scores(?) that certain children could through sheer effort never exceed what level we presume they are capable of reaching- we lower our expectations of them.  We deny the ""bright"" kids a reasonably stimulating education and the other kids the chance to prove what they can do.<p>Standardised testing does not test for ability to improve.<p>It's one thing if a kid fails because he didn't try hard enough.  That can be explained to him.  And it's a good lesson.  But it's another thing to give him a standardised test and decide a priori what's he capable of.  That just creates a strange value system where all kids, bright or not, may be denied an opportunity to show what they can do and they learn to think of ability as fixed.  And it creates a lot of fascination with ""innate"" ability.<p>Is it true there's growing evidence that ability is perhaps not as ""fixed"" as we think?",1322456349

3284602,comment,3284040,3284040,11,0,agilo,,,"Increasingly, scientists are expected to go beyond the traditional scientific paper to explain their research to a non-specialist readership. We offer some tips on writing popular science for a general audience.<p>As the budgets of governments worldwide become ever tighter, it is more important than ever for scientists to be able to explain  and in some sense justify  their research to a wider audience. Yet few have received formal training in writing at all, let alone in popular writing. There are many forms such writing can take: press releases, perspective pieces for magazines, or even blogs. In Nature Physics, although we strive to ensure that everything we publish is as accessible as possible, this is of utmost importance in our News and Views section, for which we commission practising scientists to write about research that is published in Nature Physics or elsewhere in the scientific literature. On the whole, physicists do a pretty good job of explaining these advances to colleagues in other fields. Yet there are a number of aspects of popular writing that our writers find challenging. We'll describe the most common pitfalls.<p>For a writer, the most important person in the Universe is the reader. And the most important thing to know about the reader is that you are subject to his or her whim. Every sentence you write must maintain the reader's interest, grip them and keep them reading to the end. As veteran reporter Tim Radford points out in his widely circulated journalists' manifesto (<a href=""http://go.nature.com/JGVCyi"" rel=""nofollow"">http://go.nature.com/JGVCyi</a>), This is because, although you  an employee, an apostle or an apologist  may feel compelled to write, nobody has ever felt obliged to read. And given half a chance, they will stop reading what you have written and turn the page in an instant.<p>The most engaging writing tells a story. A good story is a journey, and most people won't follow you on this journey unless you give them some idea of where it's headed. So before you even start, you need to decide where you want it to end. Ask yourself, what is the most surprising or significant aspect of the work you're writing about? When you first heard (or read) about the research, what about it made you think, Wow, I didn't expect that! It needn't be what the scientists who conducted the work think is the most important aspect: indeed, for a Nature Physics News and Views, a blog entry or similar, it is your unique perspective that readers (and editors) are interested in.<p>Remember, the piece needs a beginning, a middle and an end  and, unless you're Quentin Tarantino, it needs to be presented in this order.
The structure of the piece should reflect the journey that you've set out to describe. Remember, it needs a beginning, a middle and an end  and, unless you're Quentin Tarantino, it needs to be presented in this order. The first paragraph is the most important of the piece. It sets the stage, addressing the cardinal questions: what, why, who and how. It introduces, briefly, the wider context and motivation for the research and identifies the key challenges it is to address. It doesn't need details  that's what the middle of the piece is for.<p>On any journey, it's tempting to stop at other attractions on the way. For long journeys this can break the monotony, but for short journeys it's usually a distraction. Pick one key idea, one destination, and stick to it. Sometimes in writing you can set out for one place and on the way discover yourself heading towards another  that's fine, and if you discover that the new destination is more exciting than the original, don't be afraid to change your plans. But don't try to include both destinations, unless they're closely neighbouring towns, like Buda and Pest. You only have the time to reach one.<p>Hype doesn't help, neither do hyperbolic adjectives such as 'very', 'extremely' and 'remarkably'. It's not enough to simply assert that something is exciting, notable, novel or useful  explain why. Don't begin any sentence with 'interestingly': it is for the reader to decide whether something is interesting, it's your job to persuade them that it is. And before you describe anything as ubiquitous, pause and consider: if everyone knows it's ubiquitous  as is usually the case for ubiquitous things  there's probably no point. Cement is ubiquitous; silicon is ubiquitous; organic molecules are ubiquitous; vector calculus is ubiquitous; so what? Analogies, on the other hand, are great. But anthropomorphisms are usually terrible. Silicon doesn't have a few tricks up its sleeve: semiconductors don't perform tricks, neither do they have sleeves.<p>At the opening of A Brief History of Time, Stephen Hawking notes that his editor warned him that for every equation in the book its readership would be halved, and so he included only a single equation  E = mc2. Writing for physicists is less constrained, but not by much. Few physicists are afraid of equations. But most equations  apart from those presented in any undergraduate physics course  represent a short-hand that only specialists appreciate. Consequently, formulae are usually a waste of space, unless the implications of every index and every coefficient is explained in long form. Equations in popular writing are not efficient, they're lazy. It's usually much better to describe in words the key relations that they embody.<p>And finally, when you've crafted some beautiful prose, be ready for the edit. Unless you're writing for your own personal blog, it's unlikely that every word in your initial draft will make the final cut. In the world of professional journalism, most submissions are edited substantially; even seasoned writers regularly see their copy transformed into something quite different from their original draft. The reason is that an editor is closer to the reader than a writer. Editors set the tone and the scope, and it's the editors' vision that ultimately determines the success of a journal. So if an editor has made a change that you're not happy with, don't just change it back  it's been edited for a reason. Explain why you're not happy with the change, and try to rephrase in way that still chimes with the editor's version.",1322456297

I was told I was so smart so many times that the effect mentioned in this article seems particularly germane. I didn't work hard, so I didn't do well, but I tested high, so I thought the system was broken, not me. I was already smart, so I didn't need that fact positively reinforced, but I did need instances of hard work reinforced.

3284552,comment,3283768,3284376,16,0,ChuckMcM,,,"There are three cases that I know of, they were in an NTSB report which is not online sadly. They all involved interference with the ADF [1] and frequencies used in ILS [2]. Basically the local transmitters around airports are relatively low power so as to not interfere and they only need to 'talk' to planes that are landing, the ILS frequencies are in the 108 - 115Mhz range (just above the FM band). For a fairly long time the memory speed on PC based laptops was about 133Mhz and that was synthetically generated by clock chip running at 50 - 60Mhz on the motherboard.

3284548,comment,3284160,3284160,21,0,jacobolus,,,"I ran across Geometric Algebra a couple months ago, and am convinced its one of the most important things Ive learned about in years.<p>Some quick summary / commentary to motivate reading the link:<p>- By the 19th century, the complex numbers had become a generally acceptable concept, for example with lots of attempts to prove the fundamental theorem of algebra. The idea that the complex numbers could be thought of as 11 mapped to a two-dimensional plane was widely known. Complex numbers used as an algebraic proxy for points in the plane were useful for solving geometry problems that Cartesian analytic geometry couldnt manage.<p>- Many thinkers were trying to extend these ideas to three-dimensional space. Hermann Grassmann, who invented GA in the 1840s, was one of many, but in many ways he got things right. Another thinker who worked extensively on this problem was Hamilton, who devoted decades to the quaternions (a sort of generalization of the complex numbers with three imaginary units i, j, k instead of one) which can be quite useful for characterizing rotations and are still used in niche physics applications even though theyve been otherwise marginalized by matrix approaches.<p>- It turns out that there is a quite natural relationship between imaginary numbers, the vector part of a quaternion, and geometric algebra. As Hestenes describes in the linked essay, the imaginary unit, a bivector, can be thought of either as an operator which performs a 90 rotation on vectors in the plane, or as a directed area with unit magnitude. A quaternions vector part is just a combination of three unit bivector components of geometric algebra in 3-dimensional space. This gives complex numbers and quaternions a nice intuitive geometrical interpretation, and makes them a lot less foreign seeming to students.<p>- The traditional/mainstream conception of vector algebra (which ended up winning the 19th century fight among tools for the algebra of space) uses a dot product and a cross product, which are defined to be, respectively, a scalar and a vector. Cross products constantly come up in the physics of rotations, and in trying to compute areas and volumes. Under GA, the outer product, mathematically dual to the cross product, is seen to be a bivector. This is a much better description because the behavior of vectors produced by cross products is quite different than other vectors, which means that considering them to be the same type of object results in a great deal of confusion.<p>- Geometric algebra has a natural relationship with projective geometry (homogeneous coordinates, Plcker coordinates). Such mathematics is used constantly in applications like computer graphics.<p>- Physicist David Hestenes has spent most of his career since the 1960s elaborating and advocating GA. In exploring various areas of physics, he found that in almost every case GA was at least as convenient as the alternative mathematical formulations, and often quite insightful. For instance, some quantum phenomena which were previously considered counterintuitive or strange become quite obviously necessary and natural conclusions of their mathematical context in GA.<p>- GA is still far from mainstream. As far as I can tell, it is taught to almost no undergraduates even though it is pedagogically and operationally superior to the alternatives. It mainly comes up in very technical advanced physics courses and extremely abstract mathematical proofs. Reading some of these, one would never realize how broadly applicable and powerfully connective its ideas are.<p>- Geometric Algebra is (I firmly believe) the future of geometric education. It should be taught to all students of mathematics, physics, engineering, computer graphics, computer vision, and similar fields, perhaps starting in high school. It simplifies both understanding and computation; for instance, many problems can be done coordinate free, making their solutions easier to tackle and more intuitively relevant.",1322454863

I scored embarrassingly well on most aptitude tests, and before entering middle school found myself the subject of repeated IQ, aptitude, learning style, personality style, thinking style, and psychological analysis by befuddled education specialists trying to figure out why I did so poorly in school.<p>Here's a sample of what I endured before entering 6th grade.<p>-6 IQ tests (the first when I was 4!)<p>-ITBS (I scored so high I had to take it twice, the second time isolated in a room with two observers since they thought I had cheated)<p>-MBTI - INTJ - I've taken this test at least a dozen times<p>-Keisey - I'm unfortunately a Mastermind<p>- Holland - Strongly R-I-A<p>- Various Thinking Style tests (abstract-to-concrete, abstract-sequential)<p>- Hermann A-D<p>When I got to High School, I endured another battery of tests (3 more IQ tests), interviews and other ridiculous activities. I spent one day a week sequestered in a ""gifted lab"" where I was expected to produce works of art or something, but I found interminably contrived and boring.<p>Why did I do so bad in school despite these indicators of intelligence? I was miserable. From 1st grade on I was miserable. I hated school and everything about it. Arbitrary rules, boring wrote memorization, pep rallies, uninteresting subjects, teachers more inclined to deal with behavior issues in class than teach anything. I only bothered to attend instead of skip classes because the school had a decent liberal arts program (which was fun and had teachers that ""understood"" being miserable in school) and I helped start a poetry club with several other disaffected youths.<p>The truth is that I felt like, and in fact was, socially outcast by all of the special programs, tests, special classes, after school mentoring programs etc. I couldn't really enjoy talking with other kids my age in the normal classes and getting involved in ""special"" classes instantly cast you as an outcast.<p>After enduring all that I never bothered to take the PSATs, SATs, GREs. I didn't care. I was done being tested, probed and made to do what others wanted in the interest of nurturing my potential.<p>The truth is that, as a smart, self motivated kid, I kept myself plenty occupied by intellectual pursuits. Just outside of school. I built computers, wrote software, wrote music (often in math class), performed in community orchestras, drew in pencil, created alphabets, painted, studied a couple martial arts, read an extraordinary number of books, played piano for modern dance recitals, published poetry, got heavily involved in the demoscene. School was to be endured, not to succeed in.<p>When I turned 15 I started feeling hopelessly trapped in a system and a world I couldn't escape. Buoyed by my ""successes"" in various IQ/Aptitude tests, I thought the world just didn't ""get"" me. I started having suicidal thoughts. At 16 I found myself thinking seriously about killing myself. I spent more than one night at my sink with a kitchen knife at my wrist wondering if I should go ahead and make the cut or not. It was not a good place to be. I was saved by my music, and ability to experience <i>frisson</i> (as weird as it sounds).<p>I did plenty of extracurricular I suppose, just none that would work on a university application.<p>Kids who succeeded in school were ""losers"" (I mistakenly thought), since they didn't have the inner light that led to self-creation (or so I thought). Regurgitation of endless facts and conforming to what the teachers wanted did not impress me.<p>Despite being extraordinarily bright, I was also hopelessly naive.<p>After graduating HS (<i>just</i> barely). I took a couple years off to find myself and to grow up a little. The rarefied environment I grew up in (along with some family issues) just gave me no chance to do that -- my IQ was high, but my EQ was low.<p>If I could do it all over again? I'd do the normal classes with the normal kids. I'd avoid all of the tests and other nonsense. I'd join the baseball team and the debate club. Get a perfect SAT score and get into a top school. Selling out? Maybe. But I think I'd have a been a lot less miserable and saved fighting the system for a later time.<p>Why did I do so poorly in school despite the tests? It was probably the tests. I was told I was so smart so many times that the effect mentioned in this article seems particularly germane. I didn't work hard, so I didn't do well, but I tested high, so I thought the system was broken, not me. I was <i>already</i> smart, so I didn't need that fact positively reinforced, but I did need instances of hard work reinforced. I had no work ethic coming out of high school, I simply did things that interested me and dropped things that didn't.<p>I've thankfully grown out of many of these things, and the mantra I've used is simple, ""If you're so smart, you should be able to figure out how to <insert problem>."" If it's doing well in school, socializing well, working hard, etc. I try and overcome my problem with that simply phrase. It sounds silly, but it works and I wish I had known it growing up.

Currently I am using ~$15 bluetooth modules for devices that can cost more and won't have more than a few instances deployed in one place. I will probably use wifi for high-cost, many-instance devices and I am currently evaluating solutions for low-cost, many-instance (though currently I only need low bandwidth one way communication for these). So far I have had some success with cheap rf-link mopules such as these[1], but am investigating cheaper/smaller/more-full-featured alternatives[1]. My target for these devices is sub 10 (~$13), which includes cost of microcontroller, rf module, passive components, circuit board and packaging.<p>My point is basically that sub-$10 may be possible depending on requirements - base station or standalone; one way or bidirectional transmission; point-to-point or broadcast; size requirements and so on. I think for some of the applications mentioned in the article, sub-$10 is very possible. Of course you lose the <i>single general purpose device</i> appeal, but perhaps a small number of more-specialised devices could be available and you can then mix and match, especially if everything works off a single base station.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.sparkfun.com/products/10532"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sparkfun.com/products/10532</a> they are ultra simple, but also quite bulky<p>[2] 2.4Ghz RF transceivers from Nordic Semiconductor among others",1322453307

(Maybe it was the same one?) It's definitely made it into my mental catalog of parenting techniques should I ever have kids.<p>It also reflects my own personal experiences I think a lot of above-average-in-something people go through: at some point in their academic or professional lives, they hit a wall where their ability isn't enough and they don't have the mental discipline and other habits to put in the needed effort. Some things stop being fun and look suspiciously like <i>busywork</i> even if it will help. (And sometimes it actually is unhelpful busywork.) I know some people eat up busywork, they just grind through it, personally I can't stand it and avoid it as long as I can. Nor have I found anyone suggesting a general solution to gaining a hard-worker attitude if you didn't develop one in your childhood, and it seems like a hard problem to solve since it's part of the wider motivation and procrastination problem.<p>Unfortunately the conclusion of the post is a bit too strong:<p>""No matter the ability  whether it's intelligence, creativity, self-control, charm, or athleticism  studies show them to be profoundly malleable. When it comes to mastering any skill, your experience, effort, and persistence matter a lot. So if you were a bright kid, it's time to toss out your (mistaken) belief about how ability works, embrace the fact that you can always improve, and reclaim the confidence to tackle any challenge that you lost so long ago.""<p>Effort is insufficient, and great effort is not always necessary as those of us, who breezed through anything others struggled with, know. Ability is necessary though not sufficient. A 3-and-a-half foot tall person has no chance of being an NBA All Star, and I've witnessed not-very-smart students pour hours and hours into things like studying and still fail. Work smarter, not harder (though that requires you to be smart enough).<p>I remember Feynman reflecting on his art saying he didn't think it was very good, that he'd never in a hundred years rival a Renaissance master. Yet he still did it, probably because it was fun or interesting.

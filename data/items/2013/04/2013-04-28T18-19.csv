5622284,comment,5621718,5622156,5,0,jseliger,,,"One issue is that the line between ""fraud"" and ""creatively working around rules to make sure the doors stay open"" is thin and porous.<p>I'm part of a grant writing consulting firm, and we've worked for many Community Health Centers (CHCs, also known as ""Section 330 providers""). Most rely on some combination of Medicare / Medicaid funding, donations, and grants to keep their doors open. Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates are basically too low to pay for some combination of doctors, PAs, and NPs to provide care. Consequently, some combination of things happen:<p>* Care is so awful that it doesn't effectively exist. A patient sees a provider for one to two minutes and then gets hustled out the door with their problems put off until the next visit, since CHCs can bill by the visit, not by the time spent.<p>* Care is somewhat better but creatively accounted for. What if someone sees a provider for two, fifteen minute visits instead of one half hour visit?<p>* Some number of phantom patients receive services.<p>You may now call out that number three is FRAUD and THEFT and STEALING. But the virtuous organizations that <i>don't</i> use some form of creative accounting can't exist because they can't pay the rent, for supplies, and for providers. So there are game-theory-style incentives built in for working the system in such a way that the organization can survive. The feds know this, which is why they offer programs like the New Access Points (NAP), to throw a bone to CHCs (see here: <a href=""http://blog.seliger.com/2010/08/11/the-health-resources-and-services-administration-hrsa-finally-issues-new-access-points-nap-foa-250000000-and-350-grants-plus-some-important-history/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.seliger.com/2010/08/11/the-health-resources-and-...</a> for one place we've written about it).<p>Given this, what counts as ""fraud?"" The answer is, ""It depends.""<p>(A tangential note: we've worked for CHC clients in MSAs with a million or more people who are the only PCPs that accept Medicare / Medicaid. Specialists? Forget about it.)",1367175485

They are afraid of and opposed to a vision of society that respects minorities and other traditionally oppressed groups, and that (and not some purported ideal of ""freedom"") is the real reason they fight hate crimes legislation.<p>David Neiwert[1], has made some excellent rebuttals[2][3][4] to the ""thought crime"" and anti-hate crime legislation arguments, from which I'll quote below.  I encourage you to read the posts in full, because they make many other excellent, relevant points from which I'll have to refrain from quoting in the interests of not making this post too long.<p><pre><code>  Do hate-crimes laws create thought crimes? The issue has certainly
  been addressed in the courts, notably in the definitive Supreme Court
  case, Wisconsin v. Mitchell:

    Mitchell argues [via the First Amendment] that the Wisconsin
    penalty-enhancement statute is invalid because it punishes the
    defendant's discriminatory motive, or reason, for acting. But motive
    plays the same role under the Wisconsin statute as it does under
    federal and state antidiscrimination laws, which we have previously
    upheld against constitutional challenge.  Title VII, of the Civil
    Rights Act of 1964, for example, makes it unlawful for an employer
    to discriminate against an employee ""because of such individual's
    race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.""  In Hishon, we
    rejected the argument that Title VII infringed employers' First
    Amendment rights. And more recently, in R.A.V. v.  St. Paul, 505
    U.S. at 389-390, we cited Title VII (as well as 18 U.S.C. 242 and 42
    U.S.C. 1981 and 1982) as an example of a permissible content-neutral
    regulation of conduct.

    Nothing in our decision last Term in R.A.V. compels a different
    result here. That case involved a First Amendment challenge to a
    municipal ordinance prohibiting the use of ""`fighting words' that
    insult, or provoke violence, `on the basis of race, color, creed,
    religion or gender.'""  But whereas the ordinance struck down in
    R.A.V. was explicitly directed at expression (i.e., ""speech"" or
    ""messages""),  the statute in this case is aimed at conduct
    unprotected by the First Amendment.

    Moreover, the Wisconsin statute singles out for enhancement
    bias-inspired conduct because this conduct is thought [508 U.S.
    476, 488] to inflict greater individual and societal harm. For
    example, according to the State and its amici, bias-motivated crimes
    are more likely to provoke retaliatory crimes, inflict distinct
    emotional harms on their victims, and incite community unrest.  The
    State's desire to redress these perceived harms provides an adequate
    explanation for its penalty-enhancement provision over and above
    mere disagreement with offenders' beliefs or biases. As Blackstone
    said long ago, ""it is but reasonable that, among crimes of different
    natures, those should be most severely punished which are the most
    destructive of the public safety and happiness.""

  Of course, this is William Rehnquist, but the ruling was unanimous.
  Nonetheless, I think Matt Singer puts more or less the same argument
  much more elegantly in his first post on the matter:

    [T]he real answer is that hate crimes laws don't punish individuals
    for their thoughts. They punish individuals for acting on their
    thoughts in unacceptable ways, by targeting a community for
    violence.

  Frankly, I've always found the argument that these laws are ""thought
  crimes"" to be a little creepy, since it is echoed in the claims of the
  Christian Right that hate-crimes laws that include sexual orientation
  are an attempt to impinge upon their freedom of speech.  But gay-bashing
  is no more a free-speech right than is lynching or even, say,
  assassinating the president. Political thought may motivate all of
  them, but that doesn't mean the Constitution protects any of them.

My wife, a first-generation immigrant to the United States, is just one of many examples of first-generation immigrants to the United States I know, from many countries.<p>From the article: ""George Mason economist Bryan Caplan, whose writing at EconLog inspired Naik's interest in open borders, has offered 'keyhole' solutions as a substitute for black and white, yes-or-no questions on immigration. 'If immigrants hurt American workers, we can charge immigrants higher taxes or admission fees, and use the revenue to compensate the losers,' Caplan wrote last year. 'If immigrants burden American taxpayers, we can make immigrants ineligible for benefits. If immigrants hurt American culture, we can impose tests of English fluency and cultural literacy. If immigrants hurt American liberty, we can refuse to give them the right to vote. Whatever your complaint happens to be, immigration restrictions are a needlessly draconian remedy.'""<p>Further along in the article, what is to me the scariest possible outcome of huge immigration is mentioned: ""Naik points out that 'political externalities' may be a major drawback of allowing anyone who wants to move to stable, wealthy nations to do so. Gallup polls have found that 700 million people would like to permanently move to another country, many of them from developing nations with failed political systems. If the U.S. or another wealthy nation were to see a sudden large increase in immigrants from these countries, it's possible that the new populace will vote for bad policies in their new home. As Naik puts it, some people believe that 'if you're coming from a place that has a problem, you are probably part of the problem, and if you move to a new place you might bring the problem with you.'"" I would indeed want a keyhole solution to acculturate new immigrants to United States political culture (which I have seen done, for my wife) before allowing them to vote in local or national elections. One great advantage that the United States has over many other countries is that its sources of immigrants are so diverse that the immigrants tend to educate and broaden the perspective of one another. As I have related before here on Hacker News, all my grandparents were born in the United States, but three of the four spoke a language other than English at home, and my two maternal grandparents, one born in Nebraska and one born in Colorado, received all of their schooling in the German language. My grandparents learned English and learned American attitudes about civic culture because they interacted with other people who had come here from other places besides where their ancestors came from. That's always the strength of American society, and that's why I'm generally sympathetic to very open immigration policies. I am aware many Europeans don't feel the same way, but most countries in Europe LOST population to emigration until rather recent times, so the European experience with the benefits of immigration is not as deep as the American experience.<p>The other reason the policy suggestion is plausible to me is that I have visited Hong Kong, a territory that was flooded with immigrants during my lifetime, on more than one occasion. Countries that receive large influxes of people from elsewhere can learn to deal with that.<p>AFTER EDIT: Here's the website with the policy case for open borders<p><a href=""http://openborders.info/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://openborders.info/</a><p>mentioned and linked in the submitted article.",1367174723

5622205,comment,5620923,5621479,29,0,electromagnetic,,,">  they were simple criminals, and not of the ambiguous kind that modern-day copyright 'pirates' are.<p>Um, no they <i>were</i> the ambiguous kind that modern-day copyright 'pirates' are.<p>You're clearly confusing Somali Pirates and the Caribbean Pirates of the Golden Age. Pirates were predominantly privateers working under the authorization of a letter of Marque, and at any time could be a pirate to any of the three other major empires in the area.<p>An English Privateer could be a Pirate to the French, Spanish and Dutch, or just to the Spanish, or they could be a Privateer to the English and Dutch as they were both active against the Spanish. An English Privateer could take a Spanish ship into an allied Dutch port and still receive their payment.<p>What gets confusing is when a Privateer decided they either wanted to keep the ship, or the treasure or whatever and did so because their capture rightly belongs to the government that issued their letter of marque, or to an allied government.<p>There was an entire judicial court to decide the fate of captured crew and vessels. Was the letter of marque valid, if yes pay day, if no the privateer could be arrested (remember the Privateer could have been at sea for weeks and landed in a French Port that England was escalating tensions with). Then was the ship and cargo captured of the enemy or not due to the amount of false-flag flying at the time (if you're sailing past a Spanish island you're flying a Spanish flag no matter where you're from).<p>Privateers had to obey the laws of war, not doing so could result in punishment from forfeiture of the prize, to tort payments for killing/injuring crew members if they were cruel. So if you had to kill 1/4 of a ships crew because you're flying a French flag attacking a Spanish vessel for the English, but the vessel you attacked was Dutch and didn't surrender because they're at war with the French. Are you going to go to port and risk being fined or hung? No you'll go to the mainland and sell to the Americans, or you'll go to a Free Port or a pirate port and let the captured crew swim to shore on whatever island you pass along the way.<p>Seriously, modern day copyright pirates are much simpler to typify than the Caribbean Pirates were. Copyright pirates today are using technology to treat copyrighted media like Free-to-Air and DVRing it and fast forwarding through commercials. None of the latter is illegal, but the former is. If netflix keeps futurama on it, I can pay $8 a month to watch it or pay $100 for it on DVD. I'm a huge futurama fan, and I paid for DVDs. However I'm a fan of Family Guy, but fuck spending $40 for a new season on DVD, I haven't bought a single season of it on DVD. Fox still gets money from me because I have watched it on Netflix, which is where the copyright pirates argument goes. It's not about stealing, it's about convenience and adoption of modern technology.<p>I've deleted shows I've pirated <i>because they're on netflix and I'm paying for them</i>. It's more convenient for them to be on netflix as I don't have to fuck around with streaming software. People like convenience, and corporations don't seem to get convenience isn't going to bestbuy and dropping $50 on a new box set to have to put disk after disk into a dvd/blu-ray player just because you wan't something new to watch, but oh you can't return it if you don't like it because you've opened it and it's ""digital media"" (because apparently DRM isn't supposed to stop you copying it and then returning it, because you can't return it anyway). Yet some people pirate because they simply can't pay and they're not physically stealing anything, and some people pirate because while they like a certain show like anything on Fox, they might disagree with the corporations policies and are trying not to fund them by advertising revenue or buying DVDs, and its certainly a lot more convenient than trawling garage sales and used stores to get used DVDs.<p>So given the ambiguousness of why copyright pirates plunder and why Caribbean pirates plundered, I wouldn't say we're over-romanticizing the term. Some people are trying to, but it's an aptly ambiguous term to begin with. Also I have a letter of marque to plunder American television programming, so I prefer the term Copyright Privateer.",1367174151

Anyone who does not comply with the law faces a fine from $1000 up to $125,000 depending on his or her involvement and leadership in the protest.</i><p>That's creepy.  Would that pass a legal challenge in Canada's higher courts?  The right to assemble is a constitutional right in the US.

And we still don't know how old the universe is, if there are planets at all outside the Solar system at all, we still have to wait for the images of outer planets, nobody really knows how to fight cancer, people around the world are starving because the green revolution has never happened, treating complicated medical cases is difficult due to the lack of X-ray tomography and MRI, sailors still navigate using a sextant because a global satellite navigation is completely inconceivable and innocent people rot in jail even though DNA evidence could prove their innocence at least in some cases.",1367172216

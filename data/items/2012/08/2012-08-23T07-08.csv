What's more, the fact it's 37 interviews over 124 pages means that on average it's only 3.3 pages (including pictures) per 'interview' / example.<p>If we expect a standard introduction / conclusion to the book, then I expect the average number of pages per example would be even less.<p>Looking at the sample on his site, it doesn't exactly go that in depth with the questioning.<p>I think the key attraction to this book and many other 'self help / get rich / be successful' style books, is that people get drawn in by the 'examples' and hope that somewhere in the pages there is the answer that they've been looking for, the golden piece of information that's going to guarantee them success. However, their time may have been better used trying to execute their idea, rather than just trying to read things which reiterate the success of others.<p>- If this was $12 I would have not been so negative, but for $34 it just seems steep considering the potential lack of real value it will give.",1345708625

The side effect, which is often the <i>goal</i> that was set out to be achieved through computation, is not a secret in need of patent protection to encourage public disclosure, so the patent rationale fails.<p>If you grant only the first patent, you claim that the computation in part affects the novelty of patents, therefore the novelty of math affects the novelty of patents.<p>This is taken to the extreme where the non-math portion of a patent is a general purpose computer.  The meaningful parts of a patent are the math.  The general-purpose computer that handles all the side effects is necessary, but uninteresting, and not in the least bit novel.<p>Most of the time, specific side effects aren't even mentioned in the patents.  Here's an MP4-related patent:<p><a href=""http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect2=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&p=1&u=/netahtml/PTO/search-bool.html&r=1&f=G&l=50&d=PALL&RefSrch=yes&Query=PN/6204854"" rel=""nofollow"">http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect2=PTO1&Sec...</a><p>The patent, like other software patents, tries to tie the completely functional core (mathematical) idea to a physical computer, but what the trick amounts to is<p><i>any arbitrary math function</i> + <i>specification of a general purpose computer</i> + money => patent<p>(insofar as the math function is novel and not trivial in the opinion of a patent examiner)",1345708442

However, I don't really understand how to apply this technique in a way that could be successful and fairly generalized (i.e., it could become my new writing style). For better and worse, static linear prose allows the author to control the story that the reader is perceiving completely, it is quite efficient especially if the author can actually write! Anything else, like figures with verbose captions or lists, is often not very effective and a paper smell (like a code smell).<p>We'll need many more experiments like what Bret Victor is doing here before we can successfully evolve what is basically a 7000 year old format.",1345708331

Moreover, nothing prevents you to couple this impressive captor with any other device that would provide you with other sensorial feedbacks.

4421320,comment,4417125,4418096,1,0,super_mario,,,"I failed to address your other main charge. Putting ""faith"" in man made abstractions and scientific models, that is so often put forward by the religious (and the guy writing the nature article as well).<p>Let's clarify beliefs first. There are two kinds of beliefs. One is based on evidence, logic, reason, testable repeatable experiments. Rational mind has no option but to accept their truthfulness (sometimes after laborious examination of evidence or step by step verification of logical deduction). You could go on and deny obvious truth, but that leads to cognitive dissonance and is rather mentally taxing. The other belief is opposite, it is not based on any evidence at all and it is called faith. You are believing things without having sufficient or any evidence for it. Note also that all religions are faith based. If they were based on evidence, religion would be a branch of science, it would be a scientific theory. Put another way, if you destroyed all holy books they would never be re-created again in their present form by future generations. But destroy all scientific knowledge and it will be re-created again. Why? Precisely because science is based on testing your ideas and models. This is why science is often discovered and re-discovered by independent people, living in completely different cultures. This is why science in China, or India is the same as science in USA or Argentina.<p>It takes no faith to believe in Newton's laws. Who hasn't watched their physics professor use compressor to pump out air of two glass tubes and see feather and metal ball fall with equal speed, or seen the conservation of momentum demonstrated etc. Yes, it takes a lot of effort to test and devise experiments, but it is doable and many of us have done it for large sections of scientific knowledge. In fact, if it weren't possible to independently replicate an experiment and verify the results, then someone is doing poor science. It's simple as that.<p>Contrast that with faith based beliefs. It all really boils down to you putting faith in other people who say there is a god, and not only that, they also know his mind, what he wants us to do. And people never ask for ordinary evidence from them for their extraordinary claims, they just accept it. And what brand of delusion of this kind you get indoctrinated into is highly correlated with where you were born. And isn't it also amazing that what ever religion you get indoctrinated into feels like the right one? :D.<p>In fact, all discussions with the religious people always boil down to ""evidence or shut up"". The rest of discussion degenerates into psychology and dealing with fears of leaving various delusions.",1345707226

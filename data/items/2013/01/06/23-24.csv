5018327,comment,5018051,5018192,3,0,onedev,,,"I think he's saying that Reddit will eventually reach a point where the interests of its community and the site itself WILL diverge to some extent.<p>It's something that has to happen and will happen to the best of em, and it just depends on how Reddit chooses to handle the situation.<p>A really great example of good monetization I think is Ultimate Guitar. The site used to be completely free and the community of musicians was and still is unparalleled on the internet. They've monetized pretty heavily over the years by offering paid tools and more features/premium-content for musicians (even making their own mobile apps for things like tuners, tabs, etc). I think it was a great way to monetize the community on top of ads. However, it benefits from having a very specific focus (music) and a very focused and passionate community which makes the process of monetization a little easier.<p>The problem Reddit will have I think is that the community is extremely open, unfocused, and unrestricted (as well as having multiple sub-communities). Its very user-driven so it becomes difficult to creatively monetize without infringing on their ""freedoms"" or ""openness"". For example, I think /r/iama would be a great outlet for brands to come and have a conversation with the community (for example, before a movie release). However, that subreddit is ALREADY used like that, and it's very open. Anyone (including any brand) can come in and do an AMA so any type of monetization would have to to be a complement to the community (can't monetize the community itself without killing it or pissing people off). So how can Reddit monetize without just resorting to ads and promoted content? It's a difficult question and I don't see a clear answer.<p>If they do decide to do stuff like ""featured"" posts, I think they will have to be very very careful to not clutter up the user-upvoted content and hopefully they'll work hard to make the ""featured"" stuff interesting to the community. They'll have to make some important decisions when monetizing and I wish them the best of luck.",1357516186

5018318,comment,5018049,5018222,13,0,magicalist,,,"No, what you have here is a <i>slide deck</i> about standard or standards-track features that includes features that don't all work cross-browser yet, and may change significantly before they do. When people respond like this to slide decks, I always wonder what they would have preferred? A video of the presentation, but no live version? Screenshots of the working draft text of the spec?<p>This is a slide deck for developers. It explicitly says what browser it currently works in and where it might break. Developers usually have more than one browser installed, which makes this not that big of a deal. It does highlight explicitly, however, that developers will then have a choice to make if <i>they</i> want to use those features and want them to work cross browser. They will either have to work to implement (or find an existing) cross-browser polyfill, or they will just have to be patient while the feature is specced and implementations deploy.<p>There <i>is</i> tension here, admittedly, because eager developers will always push new features that aren't available universally yet, because it allows them to do something new. This is why, for instance, in some cases Mozilla has moved away from vendor prefixing to instead exposing some proposed features in only alpha and beta builds, so that developers won't be tempted to use them in production (which means breaking changes in a spec will break already deployed websites) until the spec is settled. This hopefully will be picked up by other browser vendors (though, again, only for some features). I know some Chrome developers have been very receptive to this approach.<p>In the meantime, it's good to educate yourself (as a developer) and others about what is coming, especially because while something is still coming (and not here yet) you can still go join a w3c/whatwg mailing list and give feedback.<p>For instance, you could start with your Audio APIs question by looking to the Audio Working Group:<p><a href=""http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-audio/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-audio/</a><p><a href=""http://www.w3.org/TR/webaudio/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.w3.org/TR/webaudio/</a>",1357516066

Some of them have moved across forum software changes, URL changes, and ownership changes.<p>What is it that makes you think Reddit communities are a different animal? Were Reddit to disappear, I'm sure those communities would find new homes. From where I'm sitting, the problem with basing Reddit's valuation on those communities is that Reddit doesn't own those communities.<p>You can't always tell a community what to do (like how one can't build an HN replacement and expect the community to simply follow you there). If the steps Reddit takes to try to make a big return on investment anger those communities, the communities are free to leave. My view is that the network effects of Reddit are not nearly as strong as those of a Facebook or Instagram, and even those appear to be having some difficulty getting as much value out of their communities as they want.",1357516021
5018314,comment,5017995,5017995,5,0,gav,,,"I think it's a bad idea to look at what Google does with their search results and then try to apply it to product search.<p>Users have a very different set of goals, with Google we know that the falloff from the top search result to the bottom is huge, people expect that the relevant results are the top couple.<p>With product search there's different goals, for example browsing an minimal set of criteria looking for a results--you're looking a pair of jeans and starting with 36x32; or the opposite you just want to know the price of a pair of New Balance 990s in a 11 4E.<p>In the latter case infinite scroll or not doesn't come into play, but the browsing case it does, and from the point of view as an Etsy customer, I have the most difficulties.<p>One of the things I've found the most is people do better with a task if they can understand how long it's going to take. If you know there's 100 search results over 5 pages, you can decide if that's too much to go through. As an aside, this is true of a lot of things, you'll do better with pull-ups if I tell you to do 20 and give you a count, than just tell you to keep going until I say ""stop"".<p>With infinite scroll you've got no idea how much effort looking through the total search results is going to take. Etsy don't make things easy, as an example Art > Custom Portraits[1]. I have no idea how many results there are, I can scroll all the way to the bottom and find out there are at least 8 pages, but that's it.<p>The search results themselves are pretty snappy, so I don't see a huge advantage of infinite scrolling. I do think the search results are pretty bad and the lack of filtering is a problem. From Art > Custom Portraits I can filter on just Pets or Silhouettes or More (which I assume is everything else). It's not obvious what these links do either, they are just floating at the top.<p>Some better filtering, e.g. by price, would help. I'm not sure what other metadata Etsy have that would be useful for an great faceted search.<p>As an aside, I've been working on (product) search for over a decade and I'm close by the Etsy offices; over a coffee I'd be happy to discuss search. Part of my New Years resolution is to do a better job of networking, so I'm happy to extend this offer to any other NYC based e-commerce shops.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.etsy.com/browse/art/custom-portraits?ref=br_nav_new_2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.etsy.com/browse/art/custom-portraits?ref=br_nav_n...</a>",1357516021

And curiously, while users didnt buy fewer items overall, they just stopped using search to find these items.<p>How is this a negative effect? The amount of stuff that users are buying should be pretty much the _only_ metric you care about. And they are probably not using search as much because browsing is much nicer with infinite scroll.<p>It sounds like they just did infinite scroll wrong.<p>If you read the comments page on the forum, the biggest complaint is that you lose your place in the scroll when you return to the scroll page.

It's pathetic.<p>To see how behind the times HBO is just go to hbo.com. For me it was a blank black screen for 10 seconds. Then a Flash loading animation for 5 seconds. And finally the site loaded.

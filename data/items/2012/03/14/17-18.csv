I just said that they weren't the people that maeon3 was suggesting and that saying that pirating the movie hurts everyone who was in some way involved in the production, distribution and sale of the DVD, but thats simply not true - the people involved in the production, distribution and sale of the digital version may be hurt and some of those people (certainly some of the people in the production) will be the same people, but the analogy is not anywhere close to being correct.<p>Anyway, people who are pro piracy will tell you that yes, it is in fact ok to pirate software too. I'm not saying I agree or disagree, just saying that the hardcore pro piracy people do not find anything wrong regardless of what is being pirated. They will also disagree with the term ""piracy"", but whatever.<p><i>is it okay for me to pirate all the apps from Mac App Store</i><p>Sure, why not! My most used ""app stores"" are the Linux package managers and everything on them is free, so not paying for apps doesn't mean that availability will be affected. No, I'm not saying I think its ok to pirate, but your comment does read as pretty disingenuous to me.<p>In any case, so many people share music, movies and software all the time without thinking about it, maybe its the businesses who should be adapting? If yesterdays business models are failing, instead of trying to shoehorn them to work through laws and regulations, maybe they should adapt? I'm personally involved in a music industry startup and we're doing exactly that - piracy is promotion to us. I'm also involved in other software things and spend a lot of time talking and thinking about game development and my conclusion is that piracy can largely be sidestepped in all of these markets by... adapting the business model to be piracy tolerant.",1331747740

3704401,comment,3701651,3702189,2,0,maaku,,,"Unfortunately all the hooplah about Python 2/3 porting has created an image, reflected in your posting, which is simply not true. To a large extent Python 3 is just a superset of the functionality of Python 2.x, adding such features as keyword-only arguments and exception chaining. This is typical for Python: each new release typically includes a handful of new community-vetted syntax features. What's unique about Python 3.0 is that this one, exceptional time they allowed themselves to go back and eliminate deprecated syntax and functionality, and to tweak a few aspects of the language (namely Unicode strings) in subtle, but fundamental ways.<p>It's been a long, drawn-out process in part because <i>everyone</i> uses Unicode strings (and if you're not, you should be). Python 2.x let you be fairly lax about unicode vs. legacy/byte strings. Python 3 forces you to clean up your act and be explicit. Other than that the two languages are -basically- the same. This isn't like C vs. C++ (which share an unhealthy fetish for curly braces but are quite different under the surface), but rather more like K&R C vs ANSI C, or C++03 vs C++0x.<p>In other words if you're waiting for Django/SQLAlchemy/whatever to transition, don't bother. Learn Python 2.7 today, use it, love it, and transition to Python 3 only when all your dependencies have made the switch. You'll then have to change a few minor things like ""raise Exception, reason"" to ""raise Exception(reason)"", but I'm sure you'll adapt just fine.",1331747729

That would be a neat trick.<p>> I'm sure you could have found a way to talk to web servers without waiting years for the WSGI spec to be finalized.<p>Indeed, we could have, and it would have benefited Django at the expense of diversity in the Python web world. It probably would have helped our ""market share"". But that's not how we roll.

I see steady movement -- slow, too slow, but movement nonetheless -- towards Python 3. First Python 3.0 came out, and it was horrifically slow, taking away any impetus to use it. So people fixed that. Then, developers ported the low-level libraries (database drivers, network protocol implementations, etc). Then we started moving to higher level libraries and tooling (numpy, wsgi, ...). Now the highest-level libraries (web frameworks, scipy, matplotlib, ...) are porting. Next, and finally, you'll get to port your apps. It's a classic dependency upgrade chain. You can't upgrade layer N until layer N-1 is done.<p>I share your frustration about the slowness, but that's frankly a characteristic of the Python community. We're relatively conservative, tending to prioritize stability and backwards compatibility over rapid movement.

You are quite right that intensive addiction to some drug like heroin can be worse, but part of the problem in the US is that being a heroin addict is almost <i>de facto</i> proof of criminality. While attempts to criminalize addiction itself have failed, if you are a police officer and you know someone is a heroin addict then you won't need to wait very long to bust the person for possession.

But I don't accept that we should condone that behavior.<p>Full disclosure: I left Micosoft last year after I long debated the trade offs of starting my career over. I was a ""top performer"" and Microsoft makes a point of telling the many people like me to stick around for all sorts of reasons. Deferred compensation. Trajectory. Influence. Etc.<p>But then I actually got into the VP's circle and didn't like what I saw. This smooth-talking, confident leader within Office was some kind of sociopath. He and his comrades snickered after a middle manager announced he would put the blame on someone for failing to deliver a major feature. I was confused when it happened. Like one big inside joke, that would be my initiation.<p>This feature was promised three years ago to the previous President of the division, and it turned out to be a top priority for the incoming president. Well, the middle manager miscalculated and let it slip. We've all done this to some degree-- answer an email late, forget to deliver on a request -- it's part of being an engineer working with people. But the middle manager had done it at a big scale and was wrong.<p>Rather than admit it because that would end his career (as I'll explain in a minute), he threw someone else under the bus. He asked this senior PM to take the project over. Rather than give her support, he decided to undermine her. He had people give copious amounts of negative feedback on her specs, held back people from working with her, and lied about progress to management. He was setting her up to fail so he could swoop in and deliver it after she failed without the wrath of being late. We've all seen managers excuse being late because of low performers. The VP and his manager needed to construct a low performer. And all he had to do was signal to the herd to stay away from her with all the negative feedback.<p>The hell they put her through so they could save their asses. And the fucking snicker. She was a warm, smart, expert in this feature and had she been allowed to work she would have outdone the middle manager. But the middle manager was ambitious. And the VP seemed to like watching people destroy their lives. And he liked loyalty. He knew if he could get dirt on his managers he would keep them for a long time.<p>I try to be a good person. I try to be honest. I try to stand up for people. But I couldn't help her. For a year I gave as much moral support as I could without the inner circle knowing. But the politics were too thick and toxic to touch. I watched her nervous breakdown. And then I knew I had to leave. Maybe it really was this one bad team. But this was the rising star VP. If this is how he succeeded then the others VPs would have to eventually.  And the middle manager was his replacement.<p>So, I got a different job. I took 3 months to travel in Europe to wash off the filth. And I checked in with my friend, and am pleased to hear that she has landed on her feet and is doing much better. At my current job the people argue about -- gasp -- the customer. What a difference.<p>But I am still angry that evil people -- the VP, the middle managers -- are allowed to continue. I don't agree we're supposed to be quiet.  Food critics used to be afraid of giving bad reviews because they wouldn't be allowed to keep their jobs (in local markets unless you were someone politics would prevail). Now we have Yelp. Really bad restaurants should have a hard time of hiding. I wish there was something like that for managers and companies without blowback.  I wish there was a way to give feedback on LinkedIn. The middle manager's profile is really funny to read. Apparently he runs all of big data at Microsoft. From Office. As a middle manager.<p>Anyway, my point is there is opportunity to expose evil people and good people in their careers. We should find a way to do it safely. People should have an incentive to be good.<p>EDIT: grammar mistakes",1331746441

It is only of meaning to small minds.<p>It's like the priest who wears dignified religious clothing while hiding a darker side.  Or the executive sporting $3,000 suits while causing financial damage to a nation.  Or the clean-cut white kid wearing nice jeans and t-shirts while selling drugs around the corner.  Or the cop wearing his uniform while committing a crime.  Be careful about using clothing to judge and form opinion.<p>Now, I happen to think that a nice (not too expensive) suit can look really good.  So can a nice pair of jeans and a t-shirt (particularly on a woman that can, shall we say, enhance the garments --call me a pig).  I had to wear a suit my entire young life because I was sent to private schools.  What this means is that I am just as comfortable in a suit as I am in jeans.  I like wearing a suit for the right occasion. But if I have to code for 16 hours straight you are going to find me in sweatpants, and old t-shirt and sandals.",1331746238

It takes some time to automate a good test but once you do it immediately starts saving time because you don't have to run the same sequence a thousand times while developing.  You can think of it more like a macro that saves you time.<p>Once you write the main test it's easy then to run it with all combinations of good and bad input.

If this happens a lot it means developers are writing code before they really understand the requirements. If developers have to re-write behavioral level tests a lot, it probably means the product owner/project manager/managers/stake holders/etc. are changing the requirements. A lot of pain should be felt gathering and verifying what the customer wants before a single line of code is written. Really, code is bad and as little of it should be written as possible. Developers should yell loudly when they have to re-write behavioral level tests.<p>Testing at the behavioral level/systems level/UX level is really verifying a lot more than just ""is this code right"". It provides a way to check correctness on the specifications, correctness on the behavior, complete coverage of expected usage by the end user, and assures that only the code necessary to get the behavior to work is being written (to name a few).<p>The carelessness I see are developers writing code without fully understanding the needs of the stake holders. The industry would be in a lot better position if managers/product owners/stakeholders/etc. were expected to provide a good set of behaviors to develop against (as an example, Gherkin or similar tools) before they start pushing developers to ""deliver something on time"". Note this is at the systems/behavior level and not at the Unit level.<p>Unit level tests provide robustness. Developers can never assure that software has no ""bugs"".<p>Behavior level tests assure completeness. Developers can assure they are meeting the requirements (Developers can't assure they are making what the customer wants: but that is not the responsibility of a developer. That is the responsibility of product owner/project manager/etc. I'm not saying that a developer can't ware that hat, but a developer not wearing that hat should not be held responsible for failings to provide for the wants of the customer).<p>All that being said, I can not emphasis enough how important I think Behavior Level testing is.<p>My 3 cents.",1331746127

Hardly any effort.<p>But I usually don't bother with too much automated testing for websites or web apps, because (1) it's more difficult to actually catch the errors you care about, have good test coverage and keep tests up to date than it is for back-end stuff and (2) I actually like clicking through my app for a while after I've implemented a new feature or changed an existing one.<p>Manually testing a web app allows you to catch many different kinds of mistakes at the same time. Almost like an artist looking at an unfinished painting. Does the UI look off? Does X get annoying after doing it ten times in a row? Does everything flow nicely? What is this page missing? Did that customer's feature request you got three days ago actually make sense? Questions you should be asking anyway, even with automated tests. And basic functionality is tested because the underlying packages are tested.<p>... but then again, if I was writing a website backed by a RESTful API, testing that API is as easy as doing a couple of HTTP requests and checking the responses, so you'd be stupid not to go for that quick win.<p>So my answer is ""We have a test suite that tests all functionality"" and ""Tests?

[rage comic goes here]<p>- Most bugs/edge cases I encounter in our production apps are things <i>I'd never</i> think to write a test for ...<p>- I deal with custom domains, authentication, and 3rd party API calls in almost every app we have. IMO, this adds 20% or more to the (already high) testing overhead just to get these things configured right in the test suite<p>- More code is moving to front-end Javascript stuff ... so, now I have to write Rails tests AND JS tests?

Long term viability<p>Given how Android's been doing in terms of phone market share, I don't think Android OEMs need to be too terribly worried that failing to provide updates is seriously affecting their long-term viability.  At least not for the moment.  These kinds of complaints mostly only crop up among HN geeks like us; the bulk of the market at large doesn't know about, doesn't understand, or doesn't care about the issue.<p>On the other hand, paying for the development resources it would take to supply those kinds of updates would force an OEM to raise their prices.  For reasons related to the above, It's reasonable to surmise that would be a suicidal move for any Android OEM.  None of them are fueled by customers who love that company's product so much that they'd be willing to pay a premium price for it.  On the contrary, the Android market is characterized by heavy price competition and razor-thin margins.  It's like the PC market of 10 years ago:  There's simply no mercy to spare for a company that  blows any significant money on happy-warm-fuzzy customer support.",1331744515

When the manual checking is too tedious I'll write code to help. I don't do unit tests (but I don't think most people who think they're doing unit tests are, either). In general I have three big problems with the philosophy of testing, especially test-first. (Though I don't feel incredibly strongly about these--software is a big field of possibilities, to suggest One Way is the Only Way is pretty crazy.)<p>The biggest is that it encourages carelessness. I want to grow more careful and work with careful people, not the other way around. Tests don't seem to make people better at doing science--that is, people test the happy-case and don't try and falsify. Testing doesn't seem to make people better are writing code, and may even be hurtful. Secondly, testing instills a fear of code, like code is a monster under the bed that could do anything if you don't constantly have a flashlight under there pinning it down. Sure, I guess your entire project might depend on that one innocent-looking line of code you just changed, but if that's true, you have some serious design problems and testing is going to make it hard to fix those. Because, thirdly, it hinders design, it's very easy to code yourself into a corner in the name of passing a test-suite.<p>Related to the design issue is a simple fact of laziness. Your code makes a test fail. Is your code wrong? Or is the test wrong? Or are both wrong? If just the code is wrong, the correct action is to fix your code to fit the test. (Which may have serious ramifications anyway.) If just the test is wrong, the correct action is to change the test. (How many people test their tests for correctness? Then test their test-testing programs for correctness? ""Test all the things!"" is an infinite loop.) If both are wrong, you have to change both. Obviously people will be motivated to assume that only one is wrong rather than both because both means more work.",1331744407

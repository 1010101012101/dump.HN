2701515,comment,2701111,2701333,8,0,vegasbrianc,,,"I lived in The Netherlands (right outside Amsterdam) for 6 years. It is a nice country with a lot to do and see when it wasn't raining.  But the Dutch tax the heck out of you on everything.  On the flip side you get an 8% holiday bonus mandatory by the government but most companies already compensate this into your salary already.<p>If you are an entrepreneur I would recommend never to hire a fulltime employee and only hire contractors or be absolutely certain on who you hire.  We had such big problems with a few employees and the government would not let us fire them.  Our company had to pay them compensation and help find them a new job?!?!  We also had another employee that became to stressed with the workload and the Dutch government told us we had to pay his salary until he returns for up to 2 years.<p>Finally the nail in the coffin for me was the weather.  I couldn't take wind and rain for what seemed like months straight and summer lasting for sometimes only 1 month.<p>I wish Appsterdam success but for me I prefer lower taxes and better climate.  Malta or Switzerland anyone?",1309186780
2701514,comment,2701111,2701111,2,0,kaiwetzel,,,"There were some interesting discussions here on hacker news before about alternatives for startups in Europe [1], [2].<p>I don't quite understand the part about Berlin, though - why not raise a family in Berlin (especially if the alternative is not some rural area but other large cities)? I found the side-stab against Ireland a little weird as well, wouldn't have considered Dublin to be ""in the middle of nowhere"", or was that about attracting developers to join your startup in Dublin being hard? (Never tried that, could well be the case). The last time I was in Amsterdam 10 years ago I thought it would be a nice place to live, but I feel the same about Ireland and I am living in Berlin right now, so ... )<p>To put it short: I think all 4 cities are worth taking into account and it depends a lot on your particular situation.

2701506,comment,2701340,2701340,44,0,patio11,,,"It is <i>exceptionally</i> difficult to run SaaS businesses with low price points, principally because you'll often be cash flow negative with regards to marketing spend.  e.g. even if the LTV of a customer is a few hundred dollars, to scale the business, you may well be paying $200+ in customer acquisition costs.  (Check the price for AdWords clicks on e.g. project management or invoicing sometime.  Oofdah.)  If you quickly recruit a couple hundred users, you may well be tens of thousands of dollars in the hole for the better part of a year.  That can be challenging without receiving external investment.  Even funded companies can fall into the same liquidity issues, typically by hiring large sales forces who take years to ramp to the point where LTV from customers exceeds the costs and commission of the sales guy who closed the deal.<p>Also, with regards to selling to teachers: I know you think they're stingy.

2701463,comment,2700791,2700791,10,0,forgingahead,,,"Getting a 404, here's the text in it's entirety from Google Cache:<p>Dear Virgin Pilots,<p>The very founding of Virgin Atlantic in 1984 was born out of an idea to reinvent the airline industry. To create an airline where the staff were united to offer a wonderful service to their customers. An airline with a special culture where the people working for it were treated well and where the company was responsive. It literally takes a lifetime to build that kind of culture  well 27 years to be precise! And what a great airline everyone has created.<p>The frightening thing is how quickly that culture can be lost. Therefore although I havent been involved with managing the airline for a number of years, as its founder I take a keen interest in its future, the future of its people and wish to make sure that no one makes a decision that damages or destroys it. It would be just too sad.<p>Keeping this kind of culture when the going gets tough is particularly challenging and a particular challenge for all of us.<p>Virgin Atlantic has withstood the toughest conditions in the aviation market since 9/11. Youve all battled against a deep recession, the impact of volcanic ash clouds, earth quakes in Japan and severe snow storms on both sides of the Atlantic to name but a few.<p>The airline and our customers continue to face rising APD taxes, sky high fuel prices, a weak pound, increased competition on most routes and uncertain consumer confidence.<p>Although you may not always agree with senior management decisions, I believe that the team has built a great airline. Starting with just one second hand 747 few people thought we would survive for more than a year or two, let alone expand to create as many jobs and careers as we have. Too young to Fly, too old to Rock n Roll were Lord Kings famous remarks at the time.<p>In the intervening years Virgin Atlantic has grown, while the industry has seen a number of airlines such as British Caledonian, Laker Airways, Dan Air, Air Europe, XL, People Express, Air Florida fail resulting in many lost jobs. A lot of our older pilots were casualties of these bankruptcies and only managed to get a job again due to the tremendous team that was building our great airline, keeping the planes flying and ensuring the public wanted to fly with us.<p>In America the internal strife in the airlines led to almost every one of them going bust; but importantly some of the jobs were saved by going into Chapter 11 and launching again. A luxury that doesnt exist in the UK - you are either bust or you are solvent.<p>In the last week I have spent a lot of time trying to understand whether the management team at the airline has treated everyone fairly and whether the company can afford to go further with its pay offer.<p>The balancing act our Chief Operating Officer and board have is that if we go further for one sector of the workforce, especially in these difficult times for everybody, we have to do the same for all sectors. And from looking at the figures it will mean asking the public to pay higher fares and in this difficult economic climate, we simply cannot do that at this time.<p>The management have told me they are happy to share up to date corporate accounts with your union so they can understand the financial context from where the offer has been made. As shareholders weve also got to ensure the airline is strong enough to withstand the many challenges it faces in this constantly changing market.<p>I have looked at the details of your offer and believe it is fair. From the companys point of view possibly a little too fair! It is one of the best in the industry, along with many other commitments that offer real value to you. If you havent read it I would suggest you do.<p>The COO has to balance the interest of everyone at Virgin Atlantic and I dont envy his job especially as weve had three very tough years in a row. I believe over the last 27 years the team has got it about right. As a result, Virgin Atlantic has survived and jobs have been secure.<p>Whilst on the subject of fairness I think its worth you knowing I have taken no salary out of Virgin Atlantic since 2005. Since Singapore Airlines bought into the company 10 years ago both of us have invested more money into the airline than weve taken out to deal with crises like 9/11 and to fund vital products and service innovation.<p>Despite this I am still committed to continuing to support Virgin Atlantic through difficult times provided those difficulties are not self-inflicted.<p>Which sadly brings us on to BALPAs very public threat of a strike. I was obviously extremely sad to see threats of strike action in the press as these negative comments will have already damaged the reputation of our airline and the trust our customers place in us - which we rely on so heavily. They have also played into the hands of our larger rivals.<p>We are already losing business from this and are in danger of losing money again this year if the uncertainty of those travelling lasts much longer. Just look at what happened at BA over the last few years.<p>We need to make sure that we never inflict such damage upon ourselves and our customers and to do so in this market place would be very dangerous.<p>Unless BALPA withdraw its threat very soon it will leave an indelible scar on the company, impact customers trust in us and damage the unique and friendly culture at Virgin Atlantic. It will affect jobs and it will make it very difficult for the company to afford the current offer on the table.<p>Your union asked me to get involved and Ive looked at all the facts and believe that our management have made the best offer it can. Our Chief Operating Officer, Steve Griffiths is ready to meet with BALPA and your committee again and I appeal to you to insist that they do so as soon as possible.<p>Your union representative also publicly asked to meet with me personally. I believe that would only cause more publicity which would further damage the airline and I am not best placed to deal with the details of the negotiation. However I would be happy to have a private meeting with as many pilots that are available to answer your questions about the future of the airline. I will have a member of my team get in touch regarding potential times.<p>Anyway, united we sailed through the last 27 years together, united well enjoy another 27.<p>I look forward to celebrating them with you. I look forward to seeing you all soon.<p>Best,<p>Richard<p>PS: Having spent the last few days reflecting deeply on this issue I believe that both management and union need to urgently work together on modernising both their relationship and communications.",1309185942

This causes a fluttering noise when you're listening to somebody transmitting from a car.<p>A more advanced radio that uses a spread-spectrum signal finds that at any moment of time,  some parts of the signal's frequency range is in-phase and some is out-of-phase.<p>If your goal is to make a low-bandwidth signal robust,  you can spread a low-bandwidth signal over a wide spectral range and you won't notice fading.  On the other hand,  if you're trying to send as much data as you possibly can in the bandwidth you've got,  you're ultimately going to implement something like OFDM.  Now,  in an OFDM system,  you're using frequencies in parallel to transmit more data,  not to improve robustness.  If you're sitting in one place your system can figure out what the fading is and work around it.  If you're moving,  the relative performance of the subchannels is always changing too fast for OFDM to work.<p>This is how you can have a good voice connection on your phone (which is using a PHY truly built for mobile operation) but not have it on for data (which is using a PHY built for high performance operation from a fixed point.)",1309185257

They usually start out as a small town, then they get a large influx of people and businesses who all want different things, and the city ends up growing by leaps and bounds with very little planning. Then it happens again and again, in waves of growth. Even if the expansion was somehow planned well, the existing part of the city won't be prepared.<p>Also, there are plenty of reasons to travel around town that don't involve what you need in your daily life. What about when your friends want to meet at a bar on the other side of town? If that's 5 blocks, no big deal. If that's 15 miles it becomes a problem.<p>High population density doesn't make public transportation efficient, good planning does. If the public transportation system is designed for a city of 2 million, and the city grows to 7 million, the public transportation system won't be effifcient, or pleasant to use, at all. The unpleasantness and eneffieciency is one of the reasons so many people have cars to begin with. Private transportation takes you where you want to go, when you want to go there, in an environment of your choosing.

Victims of sexual harassment need to call the police, like people should also do in any other case of injustice... This is a scare tactic that generalizes, therefore insults men who have done nothing wrong. What are we, dogs that need to be put on a leash? Sure, it&#x27;s not in the wording but the intent is pretty clear. Another important reason why you go to the police for these matters is that the accused gets a fair chance to defend himself (ideally, because the law favors women..).

First, available measures of inflation are imperfect and tend to overstate “true” inflation. Second, a little inflation may make it easier for firms to reduce real wages—without cutting nominal wages—when necessary to maintain employment in an economic downturn. Third, a negative inflation rate—deflation— could be even more costly than a similar rate of inflation, suggesting that a low rate of inflation might be desirable to insure against falling prices. Finally, at very low levels of inflation, nominal short-term interest rates may be very close to zero, limiting a central bank’s ability to ease policy in response to economic weakness. Because nominal rates cannot fall below zero, policymakers cannot cut short-term interest rates any further once they have lowered these rates to zero. - George Kahn, VP Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas</i><p>Basically, it&#x27;s because people want to see their wages go up, and a central bank loses the power to set short term interest rates when inflation is 0%, as we&#x27;ve witnessed in the US over the past 6 years.",1441842920

How is it decided who receives and who goes without?<p>Wants cannot be considered seriously independent of the reality of scarcity. The sum of the world&#x27;s wants is greater than the sum of the world&#x27;s resources, so we have to have some system of allocating those resources among those wants.

Talking to a professional about mental health issues puts a person in a vulnerable position. When a psychologist abuses that vulnerability, it is an extreme betrayal that would make it less likely for the patient to be able to open up to anyone else about their issues, thus obstructing their ability to receive mental health treatment in the future.<p>Performing psychological experiments on people without their knowledge could similarly aggravate underlying psychological issues, with potentially serious consequences. This is some Nazi doctor-level shit.<p>Mental health issues are in some ways more problematic than physical health issues, because culturally we don&#x27;t take them as seriously as &quot;real&quot; diseases.

A vanilla periodogram has very high sideband leakage, which means that the energy of the signal at a single frequency will look as if it &quot;smeared out&quot; across neighboring frequencies. The standard solution to this is to use the so-called &#x27;modified periodogram&#x27; where the implicit rectangular window is replaced by a different windowing function with lower sideband leakage. In general, there is a direct tradeoff between sideband power and center frequency power, and in this application, you would do well to use a different window, such as the blackman-harris, or hamming window.  See [1] for more details.<p>In addition even the modified periodogram discussed above has asymptotically nonzero variance [2], which means no matter how many samples you take, you will still have &#x27;noise&#x27; in your PSD estimate. If you use biased estimators of the periodogram, such as the welch-bartlett method or the blackman-tukey algorithm, you will get much better results.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.ni.com/white-paper/4844/en/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ni.com/white-paper/4844/en/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.mathworks.com/help/signal/ug/nonparametric-methods.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mathworks.com/help/signal/ug/nonparametric-method...</a>",1441841595

Just like if they come out with an iPhone with power-user features for professional/enterprise usage, it&#x27;s reasonably to call it a &#x27;pro&#x27; line within the phone segment, without necessarily implying it&#x27;s a more functional device than say a fully fledged desktop called a Mac Pro. I don&#x27;t really see the issue but I get what you&#x27;re saying.<p>And it does have some of that functionality, from a large screen, type cover keyboard, stylus to multi-tasking. That&#x27;s not &#x27;pro&#x27; in all industries (e.g. in software it&#x27;s not), but if you&#x27;re in marketing or say one-on-one tutoring or sales, I can imagine there are professional use cases reasonably enough to call it &#x27;pro&#x27;.<p>Either way I&#x27;m not really convinced, still feels like a terribly niche item, not really useful to most professionals (who&#x27;d I&#x27;d think, prefer light laptops and/or small tablets in combination with a growing presence of now ~5 inch phones and smartwatches) either. Sure it&#x27;s a nice device but is it going to turn around tablet sales for Apple? I&#x27;m not convinced. I just don&#x27;t see a 13 inch screen beating say the MBAs or Surface 2s of the world.<p>Mostly I just feel like expensive tablets are a thing of the past. Tablets kind of filled this niche role in between phones and laptops, until phones became bigger (4 years ago the iPhone was 3.5 inches, then 4 inches, then 4.7 and now the biggest is 5.5), and laptops became not necessarily much smaller (although they did, 11 and 12 inch form factors are super popular, versus the more traditional 15 and 17, or the old 12&#x27; powerbooks with huge bezels that are bigger than 15 inch macbooks today), but much, much lighter and with solid battery life and SSD ubiquity. I just feel there&#x27;s no real room anymore for expensive tablets, there&#x27;s still room (1) very niche uses and (2) dirt cheap tablets, plenty of room for a random &#x27;good enough&#x27; tablet for at home to read the news that don&#x27;t cost $800. I mean hell the freaking keyboard is $170, the pencil $100 and the tablet $800, obviously you want cellular, too, as a pro user, that&#x27;s $1080. So now we&#x27;re at $1350 for an iPad pro with a keyboard and stylus that&#x27;s still sub-par to other solutions. Anyway I don&#x27;t have many doubts I&#x27;ll be proven wrong, they don&#x27;t just build random stuff without a ton of focus group data and conversations with business users, but I&#x27;m not really seeing it right now.",1441840478

Surface Pro was a basically different vision (not to mention a severely compromised device). A laptop without a keyboard but with a fan and short battery life. A software stack that requires you to go into the desktop to access non-trivial settings.<p>The iPad Pro is a big iPad. No x86, no fan, touch-based software stack, etc. It&#x27;s not a computer, it doesn&#x27;t have USB ports, it can&#x27;t run desktop software. You can&#x27;t plug it into a dock hook use it as a desktop machine.[1] On purpose. It&#x27;s a very different point in the design space.<p>[1] Some people may consider the iPad Pro to be a Surface 3 with less features. And maybe it is depending on what you want from it. My take is that I&#x27;ve got a quad-core laptop with 16GB of RAM as my workhorse. I don&#x27;t want a compromise device that&#x27;s part tablet and part ULV laptop. I want a companion device with a big screen that I can mark up PDFs on. I want a bigger iPad, not a laptop with a detachable keyboard.",1441839764

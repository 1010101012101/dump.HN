Someone driving through red knows that they're likely to have an accident or mow down a pedestrian.<p>I've long wondered if it is the USA's lack of roundabouts compared to the UK that causes many Americans to grow frustrated sitting at red lights when there's no traffic driving across them on green that makes them conditioned to drive through red.<p>My neighbouring desk for a year for a hotdesk to the visiting American on a two-week tour of duty.  For many it was their first UK visit.  The majority liked roundabouts after a couple of days, preferring them to junction lights.",1182599383

Even with the free food, your startup will offer vastly more personal satisfaction to you.<p>Forget startups.  If you're an employee and choosing between two companies, all other things being equal, why not take the free food and gym and childcare? I love those $4 a bottle pure fruit juice drinks. I certainly wouldn't find it insulting to be allowed and even encouraged to drink as many of those as I wanted. What's the problem here?",1182598555

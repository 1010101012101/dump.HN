Scaling to the masses means reliability engineering and thoughts given to logistics, manufacturing, etc.<p>Getting a version 1 out the door can be extremely expensive. Perhaps the revolution in China is changing this, making it much easier to build things in 10s and 100s.<p>And any interesting product will also have software. This makes it a superset of software startups.",1186152589

Unless you consider 95 percent (or whatever) of all the movies and music and software ever made as consistently ""shitty"".<p><i>Or they hate paying an inflated price.</i><p>Look up ""beethoven symphonies"" on piratebay, and you'll see plenty of people seeding and leeching. Then look up the same on amazon, and you'll see that all 9 are available together as low as 20 dollars. If 20 dollars is an ""inflated price"" for that product, well, then there's no point in trying...<p><i>Piracy is competition and should be treated as such</i><p>Compete with zero? Sigh.

39021,comment,38951,38951,0,0,ivankirigin,,,"I like the note about privacy. I believe it -- we need to push for a transparent society. Certain activities will always be easy to do anonymously, but certain capabilities are just founded on identity persistence. I'm curious if there could be a framework that has great persistence of preferences and identity, and maintains anonymity.<p>Another note: it's all just software. That makes it easier to acheive if you integrate systems. It also limits reach. You still need to move your ass from point A to B to C. Most of the time, you'll need to pay attention while doing it -- automated driving isn't part of web 4.0.<p>Also, there is a ton of legwork involved in services. Many services demand people behind them. It would be nice if humans were only needed to thing -- to have and share desires/preferences/thoughts. Right now, only a minority of people have the luxury to do that full-time.<p>",1186152313

39012,comment,38967,38967,0,0,staunch,,,"I found cromatic's article fairly weak. It's basically impossible to get past the amount of uncoolness Perl has collected and not really worth trying. But I use it and enjoy it tons despite the snide remarks I must endure. A small price to pay in my opinion.<p>It's obvious to anyone being honest that the main reason most people don't like Perl is for the same laughable reason they don't like Lisp: the syntax looks scary at first. Few people really get past that point without coming to at least respect its power.<p>For web development I'm using Catalyst[1] DBIx::Class[2] and Template Toolkit[3] combined with CPAN[4] it's an unstoppable combination. Most of my work is plugging modules together cleanly. My code is small, efficient, and rock solid.<p>I've dabbled with Python and Ruby quite a bit but I just don't find significant advantages and missing CPAN always hurts. It's good that there are lots of people writing Python and Ruby code now. In 5 years there might be enough libraries to make them as useful as Perl is today.<p>1. <a href=""http://search.cpan.org/dist/Catalyst-Manual/lib/Catalyst/Manual/Intro.pod"" rel=""nofollow"">http://search.cpan.org/dist/Catalyst-Manual/lib/Catalyst/Man...</a><p>2. <a href=""http://search.cpan.org/~mstrout/DBIx-Class-0.08003/lib/DBIx/Class/Manual/Intro.pod"" rel=""nofollow"">http://search.cpan.org/~mstrout/DBIx-Class-0.08003/lib/DBIx/...</a><p>3. <a href=""http://template-toolkit.org/docs/manual/Intro.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://template-toolkit.org/docs/manual/Intro.html</a><p>4. <a href=""http://search.cpan.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://search.cpan.org/</a>

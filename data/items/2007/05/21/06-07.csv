Microsoft is probably the only software company with a decent interest in the web and the pocketbook to pay for a highly valued site. And the aQuantive buy is the biggest they've ever done (and probably will ever do).",1179730402

Of course, they took <i>much</i> more time than that to create. This is one of the few instances where I feel the need to make a plug for the content creator since these videos are violating his copyright. If you use them, at least look at the other courses on their site and consider joining for a month ($30) at least. I'm not affiliated at all with these guys, but they're putting out great value and it'd be a shame to see a tiny company like this fail from folks ripping off their content and putting it on youtube. (Note that I feel very differently on this subject when it comes to some of the big media conglomerates!)<p>Actual link to this course: <a href=""http://www.vtc.com/products/rubyonrails.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vtc.com/products/rubyonrails.htm</a>",1179729228

However, their check of this comes down to ensuring you have a piece of ID that matches the name on a piece of paper you bring from home.<p>To use an example from the story, you could have 20 people who are not travelers each smuggle a component of a bob through security (a portion of a liquid, ptex, etc.) and then give those components to a single flyer with a valid ticket (who would have presumably gone through security with NO contraband at all, so as not to burn his identity if he accidentally went through a line with an alert agent).<p>There is also the simple matter of basic vulnerability testing.  If you have to spend $500 on a ticket to get a trip through the TSA line, it's very costly to test the edges of the system.  If you can go through the line 4x per day at 3 different airport terminals, or multiple airports that are in close proximity to each other, then you can easily run 100 test scenarios in a week about how the lines are managed, processed, etc.<p>As an example, I travel frequently and don't like dealing with the full-body scanners.  In most airports at the busy times they ""randomly"" select some passengers to just go through the metal detectors because the body-radiators are slow.  With about 80% accuracy I can watch how the lines are being handled and time my fiddling around with items on the xray belt to be ""randomly"" selected to skip the full body scanner.

Your constitutional protection vs multiple tryals only occurs after a jury has said not guilty it does not apply when a jury can't decide on a verdict.<p>PS: In the US <i>In the United States, the result is a mistrial, and the case may be retried. Some jurisdictions permit the court to give the jury a so-called Allen charge, inviting the dissenting jurors to re-examine their opinions, as a last ditch effort to prevent the jury from hanging. The Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure state, ""The verdict must be unanimous...If there are multiple defendants, the jury may return a verdict at any time during its deliberations as to any defendant about whom it has agreed...If the jury cannot agree on all counts as to any defendant, the jury may return a verdict on those counts on which it has agreed...If the jury cannot agree on a verdict on one or more counts, the court may declare a mistrial on those counts. A hung jury does not imply either the defendant's guilt or innocence. The government may retry any defendant on any count on which the jury could not agree.""[7]</i>",1324501364

There are a number of ways to get this; you can do it from a book (<i>""Mind Over Mood""</i> is one recommended book) you can do it online (the Australian <i>""MoodGym""</i> is often recommended) or you can buy therapy.  Look for someone experienced and registered.  In the UK you can go to your GP and mention IAPT (Improved Access to Psychological Therapies) but keep pushing it, some GPs say there isn't any when there is - you may have to ask your local MH trust about talking therapies.<p>2) Remember that tech invites high performers, and HN has a bunch of VERY SMART people.  Don't compare yourself to them; you'll always feel lousy.  Compare yourself to the people behind you on the bell curve.  You are above average, and for the moment, that's good enough.  Now you just need enough motivation to plug away at the good ideas, and keep producing them until you get the awesome ideas.<p>3) Make sure your food and exercise are good - there's lots of evidence to show that good exercise helps with mood. And eventually it may lead to team sports, which have a bunch of social life benefits.  Alcohol will lower mood.  Some people  find that even small amounts of alcohol will lower mood for days.  Being careful with sugar, caffeine and alcohol should help.<p>4) Learn a time management technique, like pomodoro (but there are probably others) and keep at least one project going.<p>Most importantly, good luck, and keep going.  If you find things getting worse it's a really good idea to see a doctor.  Depression sucks, and sometimes the worse it is the harder it is to treat.",1324501291
3379123,comment,3377388,3377636,1,0,Joeri,,,"I wouldn't dismiss PHP's speed problems that quickly. Opcode caches typically don't speed up the actual execution, just the loading and parsing. I use zend server (with zend optimizer) and I've got PHP code that is hard CPU bound, as optimized as it can be, and still takes minutes to run to process perhaps 2 megabytes of raw data. By contrast, the exact same feature implemented in Delphi runs in less than 2 seconds, even though the code is an order of magnitude less efficient.<p>PHP isn't just orders of magnitude slower than JIT-ed or native compiled languages, but it has no affordances for that fact. There's no standard way to run code in the background. Zend won't start working on one either, because they sell a jobs queue as part of their Zend Server product.<p>Frankly, a JIT-ed PHP is the only feature I need. I appreciate the syntactic sugar added in the last few revisions of PHP, but honestly, I'd trade every new feature since PHP 5.2 for a bit more speed. With stuff like closures and traits it seems like they're working on the easy stuff instead of the necessary (but hard) stuff.",1324501287

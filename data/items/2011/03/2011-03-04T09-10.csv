Technical?  No.  Emotional?  Yes.  Only a small fraction of the population is very technical, but a huge fraction is quite emotional.  So, the ""message"" was all emotionalism and not rationalism and certainly not rationalism about technology.<p>Generally, then for any person A who works in field X, actually to get paid in field X the person A has to know something about field X, know more than the LCD of some audience of millions independent of X. Then when person A reads some old media LCD content about X, they conclude that the writer didn't know anything about X and once again tosses aside old media.<p>Here on HN we see the pattern clearly:  It's super tough to find anyone writing for old media who can write as much as a single, significantly meaningful paragraph on computing without looking uninformed on computing.<p>So we are seeing ""the medium is the message"" again:  Now the ""medium"" is the Internet which permits focused content from experts in that content, and the role of 'generalist writers' using formula fiction to grab people emotionally with LCD content is fading away.<p>With irony, Dear Vanity Fair:  This time the sky actually is falling, on old media.<p>'Vanity Fair' RIP.",1299231758

Everyone else thinks you can have 3.5, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10 even 12 inch webpads and that they're made from 99% the same commodity hardware and software.<p>Android is in the process of returning Apple to single digit marketshare in the small webpad category, a story that tech churnalists have missed because they live in a rich, old, white, U.S.-centric, gadget-obsessed bubble.

In such a situation, the email archives and/or the backup script may never come into play anyway.<p>You could also not use a script and do it by hand every day.

Having the interviewee give a brief talk and following with a dialogue about something they've worked on in the past is absolutely vital. An interview consisting of that exclusively is probably better than an interview consisting solely of brain teasers. However, that's a silly comparison.<p>Way too many questions get labeled (on the internets) as ""puzzles"" and ""brain teasers"" when they are simply abstract algorithm questions. Crossing rivers with chickens and wolves, and/or figuring out the prisoners with the one room and the light-bulbs and all that crap are brain teasers and are totally useless. Impossible questions are not brain teasers. If I asked you how many tires are in the city of Chicago, and you said 1000, what should I think? What does that tell me?<p>Even still, way too many programmers decide to get intellectually offended (at least on the internet) when they hear about some problem that may involve, say, dropping light bulbs off a building to find the highest floor from which they can be safely dropped. This is nothing but an algorithm development question for a problem that doesn't have an off-the-shelf solution. This is testing your algorithmic thinking skills.<p>And as always I hear that phrasing such and such algorithm question ""in real terms"" is better than phrasing it abstractly. I've never seen a compelling argument that this is true except for this faux outrage that people have about puzzle questions. Phrasing it abstractly is quicker, simpler, and clearer. It removes all the hemming and hawing about implementation details. It removes answers like ""doesn't intel have a library that does that?"". It gets to the point, and quickly.<p>There is a second problem with that angst, and comments like: ""I just can't muster any enthusiasm for completely random arbitrary puzzles in the face of so many actual, real world problems."". It is that we are computer scientists and abstract problem solving is something we should care about. Abstraction shouldn't be some barrier that makes it hard for you to think about a simple problem. Abstracting the real-world details away from you shouldn't get you emotional.<p>Besides, if I had an interview that was only a water cooler talk about something in the past, Jeff Atwood would smack that out of the park.

519947,comment,519283,519283,0,0,jganetsk,,,"Definitely has some insightful commentary, but I feel like he hasn't gotten into the heart of the subject matter.<p>Haskell has something like NULL, it's called ""undefined"". At first, it feels like it's an ugly hack, something provided by the language designers as an afterthought. But it's theoretically sound, and pretty easy to construct manually. Just open up your Haskell REPL and type...<p>let x = x<p>This is an infinite loop. Another way to look at it is ""let x = (let f x = f x in f ())"". You will see x :: t, a single type variable, the most general polymorphic type. (This is also known as bottom type). In other words, it can be used anywhere, just like ""NULL"".<p>Shouldn't there be no values of bottom type in a statically typed language? How could this happen? Laziness. Try to force x, and you will find out that it never terminates. Because of laziness, any argument to any function could be a suspended infinite loop, or a suspended thrown exception. You just don't find out until you need the actual value bound to that name.<p>So, how is Haskell's undefined different from the NULL of so many languages? In one very key way... with NULL, one can check for NULLness. You can say ""if (x == NULL)"". With undefined, there's no way to express that. Any kind of expression that forces the value of undefined should itself be undefined.",1237302732

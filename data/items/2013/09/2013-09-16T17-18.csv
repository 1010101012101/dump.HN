Let me give you a history lesson, on the off chance that you&#x27;ll prove me wrong. When you live under an oppressive regime the sum of the power stacked against the few that would do something about it is such that they have three choices: rise up and be cut down, shut up and comply or flee. If you feel like judging any of those that either comply or flee as being either cowards or worse then you forget that ordinary people typically just want to get on with their lives without interference from the authorities. Not everybody is in a position to risk all for an improved status quo, for instance. Those that do are to be commended, those that don&#x27;t are not to be despised. That&#x27;s all that I can impart to you from my (short) time of voluntary stay behind what was then called the Iron Curtain, but it is a lesson that stayed with me.<p>As for the crazy talk, I can definitely imagine a world where there are no border controls but where countries are still sovereign to greater or lesser extent. There are vast regions in the world where we have exactly that situation right now, I don&#x27;t see why it couldn&#x27;t apply to the rest of it. The current leader of North Korea might agree with you that this is crazy talk, but then again, that&#x27;s exactly my opinion of him.",1379354336

It really slows down development to a crawl.<p>You learn very quickly to segment designs and validate everything as far as humanly possible before even dreaming of simulating/compiling larger functional blocks.<p>These are ways in which modern hardware design is vastly different and vastly more expensive than any comparable software development workflow.<p>The cost of hardware tools is pretty much insignificant when you consider the entire process.

But much of the important things should still apply.<p>There are a lot of sacrifices to be made, it&#x27;s really not for everyone, and timing is pretty important, but...<p>Though I&#x27;m not sold on becoming a professor, getting my PhD was a great experience, and really has set me up for a lot that I wouldn&#x27;t have been able to do otherwise. Especially in the US system, where most students are required to do some teaching and a good amount of coursework in addition to rigorous research projects, there is a lot of personal/intellectual/character development that comes from not only balancing these responsibilities but being able to intellectually parse, synthesize, improve, and communicate the content.  Granted, there are other ways to get some of these experiences, and a lot is missing, but there is some serious Gestalt here.  Qualifying exams, as fear-inducing and social-life-destroying as they may be during preparation, really do whip you into intellectual shape.<p>And if you are really interested in your research, and your methods of inquiry are sufficiently compatible with the &#x27;establishment&#x27; to keep you out of too much trouble, the opportunity to immerse yourself in your interests is rare elsewhere, especially if there isn&#x27;t a lot of immediate monetary incentive to study the subject.<p>I do industry consulting as well as academic research now, and the industry stuff is still considered &#x27;research&#x27;.  Neither position would be available to me without a PhD, and I like both jobs much more than the work I see people with BS/MS degrees doing (or what I see most faculty doing), even though I am currently a bit underpaid.<p>So I would say that it&#x27;s not always bad practical choice, even for those who aren&#x27;t interested in professorships.

Next to our table was another couple that paid for reserved seating.  Note that when I say &quot;reserved table&quot; you should know that the tables are practically touching each other and the room is wall-to-wall people.<p>Somehow this other couple with a reserved table ends up with two dudes being sat at their table.  They&#x27;re actually closer to me than the other couple though.  The woman from the couple got up three times to complain to the manager.  She literally missed half the show.  Finally the manager comes up to me, hands me two free tickets for a future show and asks if I would mind if the two dudes sat at our table.  I said no problem.  Ironically, the dudes were further away from us at our table and closer to the lady complaining about them sitting at our table.<p>Some people are just so unbelievably difficult to deal with  and are unsatisfied with anything to the point they will cut off their nose to spite their face.

It&#x27;s hardware design.  It&#x27;s no different from connecting raw gates and chips on a breadboard.  This is a very important distinction that is often glossed-over in HN conversations.<p>Verilog is a tool with which you explicitly or by inference DESCRIBE hardware. You are not programming hardware.  That&#x27;s software.<p>At some level this concept of static types is nonsensical.  You have registers made up of flip-flops that move data around from circuit block to circuit block.  That&#x27;s it.  Data types, in many ways, are software constructs, they don&#x27;t really exist in hardware.<p>One would not look at a breadboard full of chips or an old-school PCB with latch and flip-flop chips and discuss static data types.  Maybe you&#x27;ll talk about fixed with data busses that implement this or that encoding, but that&#x27;s about it.<p>One could argue that a specialized floating point processor has a data type. That&#x27;s one way to interpret it.  Another way is to say that it has a, say, 64 bit architecture that, by convention, is interpreted in order to be able to represent floating point numbers within certain constraints.  If by that we mean &quot;static data type&quot; then, well, I suppose I can go with that.",1379353685

They had quite a brisk business in J2ME VMs, MMS software, etc. But most of their product lines were aimed at feature phones and have been in decline for some time now.<p>However, they were the first to demonstrate Android app compatibility on Meego. At the time I saw this demonstrated, they were using their own VM, which runs Java bytecode, and not the Dalvik VM. This has the disadvantage that you need to modify the Android app build process to create jar files with Java bytecodes. But, because all Android apps are translated from Java bytecodes to Dalvik bytecodes, and because the Dalvik VM semantics is very nearly identical to Java VM semantics, this should work just fine except for the inconvenience of either having to recompile or otherwise transform your apps into a form that can be used on a Java VM. This may have changed since then, and they may be using Dalvik now. There are no licensing obstacles to doing that.<p>At that time I had a personal interest in Android app compatibility since I was CTO at a company doing the same thing with a different approach. So I can say there is really nothing standing in the way of good compatibility with Android apps on any Linux-based mobile OS, and other OSs are possible as well. Systems like this should work very well and developers should not need to modify any code.<p>When products like this actually get released, basic Android compatibility should not be the differentiator. Things like how well the home/desktop of the native OS is integrated, whether an app widget host is provided, etc. are going to be where differences are likely to arise.",1379350873
6394282,comment,6392665,6393759,6,0,dalke,,,"G is notoriously hard to measure accurately.<p>Wikipedia&#x27;s entry on the topic suggests that you read a 1997 review paper at <a href=""http://iopscience.iop.org/0034-4885/60/2/001"" rel=""nofollow"">http://iopscience.iop.org/0034-4885/60/2/001</a> . That abstract starts:<p>> Improvements in our knowledge of the absolute value of the Newtonian gravitational constant, G, have come very slowly over the years. Most other constants of nature are known (and some even predictable) to parts per billion, or parts per million at worst. However, G stands mysteriously alone, its history being that of a quantity which is extremely difficult to measure and which remains virtually isolated from the theoretical structure of the rest of physics. Several attempts aimed at changing this situation are now underway, but the most recent experimental results have once again produced conflicting values of G and, in spite of some progress and much interest, there remains to date no universally accepted way of predicting its absolute value.<p>The Wired article confirms that it&#x27;s hard to measure, with some examples of the difficulties.<p>However, G* M is not hard to measure accurately. We believe the Earth gains about 100,000 kg per year from meteors, and in any case, the Moon and the Earth have changed by much less than one part in a million over the last few decades. So any change in G* M should be due to a change in G, even if we can&#x27;t measure G directly.<p>This is of course also why we don&#x27;t know the mass of the Earth better than a few hundred parts per million.",1379350861

Yes it&#x27;s great that this company is trying to help us, but we don&#x27;t need the help, and we don&#x27;t want to have to deal with the umpteen youtube videos that will try to demonstrate why FEMA is ushering in the New World Order.&quot;<p>etc. etc.<p>Some human made a somewhat logical, but largely emotional decision.

From the article:<p>>A meta-analysis of non-cancer Phase 1 drug trials, published last year in The British Medical Journal, found serious adverse events in only 0.31 percent of participants, and no life-threatening events or deaths.<p>And the last event comparable to this, according to the article, happened in 2006 in a different country.<p>I was surprised by this. I would not have expected drug trials to be risk free, in fact I thought that was the whole point. Apparently they are already super conservative and safe. I&#x27;m not sure why people are alarmed or calling for more regulation.<p>It&#x27;s probably impossible to 100% safety, and certainly not desirable. Parent comment is definitely right that we kill more people through inaction and need to be far more liberal. Total lives saved is all that should matter.<p>Somehow one person dying out of many drug trials over many years is news that&#x27;s on the front page of HN. But the 22,000 people that died of cancer today isn&#x27;t.",1452884371

10911298,comment,10910455,10910455,0,0,throwaway1456,,,"> Before 2007, the way to participate in Open Source was fragmented. Each project had their own workflow, patches circulated in emails, issues were reported in a myriad ways, and if anyone wanted to contribute they had to figure out every project&#x27;s rules.<p>And it was much better IMO. Now we have a centralized website, in the hands of a single corporation, which requires nonfree JavaScript for much of the basic functionality[1]. Git was designed to work well with email and has commands built-in to format, send and apply patches. I think anyone who used email for patches seriously will agree that they are largely superior to GitHub&#x27;s pull requests.<p>The free software movement being fragmented is a good thing. GitHub is the land of trends: web developers using Mac OS X who make apps with the latest trendy frameworks like React and Angular (if you think that&#x27;s a misportrayal, look at the first three pages of the most starred repositories on GitHub[2]). These people don&#x27;t care about the free software movement, they&#x27;re just following the current trends, one of which is &quot;Open Source&quot;. But if they really cared about free software, they would not be using Mac OS X or GitHub, which requires you to run nonfree JavaScript code in your browser to report issues, open pull requests, etc.<p>The serious projects that do care about free software don&#x27;t use GitHub.<p>[1]: See Mike Gerwitz&#x27;s <i>GitHub Does Not Value Software Freedom</i>: <a href=""https://mikegerwitz.com/about/githubbub"" rel=""nofollow"">https://mikegerwitz.com/about/githubbub</a><p>[2]: <a href=""https://github.com/search?q=stars:%3E1&s=stars&type=Repositories"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/search?q=stars:%3E1&s=stars&type=Reposito...</a>",1452884321

10911292,comment,10911164,10911164,0,0,shostack,,,"This post really resonated with me. In a past life I was involved in most of the hiring for a large functional group in the ad agency world.  Ad agencies are notorious for their poor work/life balance, and this shop was no different.  As I was often the last person to interview (once they&#x27;d made it through everyone else), I&#x27;d typically ask some question to the extent of &quot;has anyone discussed the workload and typical hours with you?&quot;  People with a couple years experience would often say &quot;no, but I expect they are typical for agencies&quot; indicating they knew what the game was.  Entry-level candidates needed it spelled out though, which I did.<p>The ones that accepted the offers inevitably all told me at some point down the line that they appreciated that I didn&#x27;t sugar coat things in the interview. I also found that it helped them be happier in the role because the job better aligned with their expectations for it.<p>What candidates did not see were the battles I fought behind the scenes to get more resources, push for SOWs that were actually reasonable based on the team allocations, etc. That said, the fact that there&#x27;s really no changing that in a low-margin service-based industry was a large part of why I decided to go to a a healthy product-based company that didn&#x27;t react negatively when I stated one of my top requirements for a company is a healthy work/life balance.<p>That&#x27;s just one example, but there have been other hiring situations I&#x27;ve experienced throughout my career where I wish I could have been very candid about things like:<p>&quot;You would be filling a hole in a team with constant churn because of poor management&quot;<p>&quot;The client you will be on is a real asshole who yells at everyone and has unrealistic demands&quot;<p>&quot;We typically pay below market because everyone wants to work on our clients and we know you&#x27;ll be gone in 1-2 years anyway&quot;<p>The list goes on.  I&#x27;ve also been on the receiving end of some of this when looking for a job.  I&#x27;m fortunate that I&#x27;m accomplished enough in my career to have the luxury of being pickier in where I work, so I&#x27;m able to ask some pretty blunt questions that others might frown on to get to the root of these, and the answers are always enlightening, and I avoid situations that almost certainly would have been miserable.  But I also get the hiring manager&#x27;s perspective...if you are resource starved and drowning, sugar-coating things is more likely to get people accepting the offer and being there at least in the short term.  It can be really hard to put the long-term health of the company ahead of your personal pain when you are just an overwhelmed cog in the machine.  Being honest and upfront about these things takes bravery, and will inevitably grow your team with people whose expectations match the reality.",1452884222

We look at the people who did the biggest wrong and hold them responsible for most if not all of the blame, even though we understand that there were far more actors who could&#x27;ve greatly impacted the actual harm done.  Consider child abuse.  There are certain forms where, depending upon reactions from parents and therapy offered, the outcome could vary greatly from extremely harmful to minimal damage to the child.  But regardless of the outcome of the harm, and regardless if the outcome was influenced by other parties, we place the guilt of all the harm, both realized and risked, on the one who committed the abuse.  We do not need mastery of how the financial system broke to deal out punishment just like we don&#x27;t need mastery of the pathways by which emotional abuse leads to suicide attempts to punish the abuser.<p>It isn&#x27;t perfect, but it is better than just washing our hands after slapping a few wrists when we don&#x27;t understand all the details.",1452884181

10911283,comment,10905108,10910046,0,0,jonnathanson,,,"<i>&quot;LA is a hell for cars made by urban planners who deliberately made it that way.&quot;</i><p>I agree completely. There is no question——in fact, it&#x27;s a matter of historical record——that mass transportation, urban layout, etc., were intentionally subverted in Los Angeles by the automobile industry, resulting in the crazy mess we now deal with.<p><i>&quot;What problems do you think will be solved by robot cars that shouldn&#x27;t already be solved by Lyft or Uber (which are functionally identical except for the presence of a human driver)?&quot;</i><p>First, there are 9.8 million people living in Los Angeles County. So we&#x27;d need to be speaking of an Uber and Lyft ecosystem scaled up sufficiently to service a meaningful fraction of that population, economically, on a daily basis. It seems infeasible.<p>Second, Los Angeles has some challenging quirks to which human drivers, en masse, are particularly susceptible. For instance, we have very few left-hand turn signals; navigating a left-hand turn at a busy intersection is essentially an ad hoc game of chicken between all participants at that space and time. Some informal &quot;rules&quot; have emerged to navigate such situations, but the social contract breaks down under heavy traffic and its resultant, emotionally compromised drivers. There are also too many traffic lights, which studies have shown to create more congestion than they ostensibly solve for. Very few of these lights are sequenced. As a result, LA drivers are consistently flummoxed by an erratic tempo of starts, stops, and false restarts, forcing the entire &quot;herd&quot; to stumble into each other from the front to the back. And don&#x27;t even get me started on our downright batshit approach to freeway onramps and offramps. Most important, there simply aren&#x27;t enough roads, or wide enough roads, to handle the load that LA now brings to bear at every hour of every day -- and building more would involve an exercise of eminent-domain residential and commercial reclamation on a scale unseen in human history.<p><i>&quot;Cars will never be able to zoom through a downtown metropolis at 60 mph, unless the city is entirely stripped of pedestrians&quot;</i><p>This is a strawman. I don&#x27;t recall saying that I expected robotic cars to magically make all traffic problems disappear. Rather, I said that they&#x27;d <i>do better</i> than we currently do.<p><i>&quot;The problems you highlight are NOT caused by human drivers, they are caused by cars, and autonomous or not, those issues will remain.&quot;</i><p>No, the problems I&#x27;ve highlighted are caused by poor (and in many cases, as we&#x27;ve discussed, deliberately poor) urban planning, made worse by an infrastructure completely inadequate for the scale of the city and its population in 2016. These things impose a cognitive load on LA drivers that is simply too great at the scale LA traffic now brings to bear. The original cause is the layout, and the proximate cause is the humans&#x27; individualist navigation of that layout while enmeshed in a giant, uncoordinated swarm.<p>These are precisely the kinds of conditions I expect a fleet of interconnected, intercommunicative AI cars to do a better job of navigating.<p><i>&quot;I don&#x27;t have these issues because I live in a dense very walkable city and ride my bike everywhere. This is how we should be thinking: cars simply don&#x27;t belong in cities, and a robot fleet won&#x27;t change that.&quot;</i><p>This is handwaving. We can&#x27;t wipe cities like LA off the map and start over. So we have to make do with the cities we have now. &quot;Cars don&#x27;t belong in cities&quot; is a nice sentiment, but it&#x27;s entirely impractical in several of the biggest and most economically important cities in this country.<p>For whatever it&#x27;s worth, I&#x27;m in wild agreement with you about the unfortunate situation LA is in, and <i>why</i> it&#x27;s in that situation. And I agree that a car-centric approach is the wrong approach to urban planning. But LA isn&#x27;t losing the automobile anytime in my lifetime. We have to be realistic about that. So in my mind, the exercise is about making the least of the evil we have to live with.",1452884054

The latter group would argue that a campaign to restore hearing to the deaf would actually be a kind of genocide -- a coordinated campaign to wipe out a distinct culture, with its own languages and traditions, just because it is physically different than the majority.<p>That may sound wild, but the more you think about it the more troubling questions it raises. Well-meaning people would never consciously try to shame deaf people for being deaf, for instance, but the viewpoint embedded in the idea of ending deafness is that the deaf are broken people who need to be fixed by being made more like the rest of us. Do we actually agree that deaf people are broken, incomplete? If we do, does it follow that deaf people who <i>refuse</i> our cure should be <i>compelled,</i> in some manner, to accept it? How far are we willing to go to eradicate deafness? Is &quot;eradicating deafness&quot; even a morally legitimate thing to aspire to?<p>I&#x27;m not deaf myself, so I won&#x27;t pretend to have an authoritative perspective on any of these questions.

And it helps if more people agree on the means of keeping score; it makes it easier for them to play together.  But it doesn&#x27;t really matter whether that&#x27;s dollars or euros or pounds or drachmas or cigarettes.  People use the currency that the people they want to play with use; the dollar is popular because many people want to play with the U.S.  They don&#x27;t adopt a new currency unless there is no alternative way of keeping score.<p>The problem with Bitcoin is that most mainstream goods & services providers didn&#x27;t really want to play with the people who used it.

Bitcoin suffers from centralization, the very thing it was designed to circumvent The Bitcoin cultist are emotionally wrapped up with the idea that it has to be everything for everyone. Money has a way of making us emotional. \nBitcoin has to be a payment machine for payment processors, It has to be a store of wealth for investors, It has to be a currency for libertarians. It is so caught up in trying to be everything that it does none well. Bitcoin developers dont be afraid to go your own way. They should branch out into new areas and create new coins, applications and opportunities.  Why does it have to be Bitcoin or bust.  Proponents attack new ideas. They wake up at night in terror that something new might emerge that meet needs in better ways. What would the Stockmarket be like if there was but one issue to trade.  It is no wonder that Bitcoin companies struggle to make money. The market is being restrained from growing by those that seek to control the golden goose and make certain that there is no other options. Yes, new things are coming and new financial markets will come into being whether Bitcoin changes its protocol or not.

And this is not the first time I&#x27;ve seen people calling side-channels or looking at metadata &quot;sophisticated&quot;. Is it because 99% of programming consists of writing absolutely trivial spec-following code that doing anything that&#x27;s not in the standards is &quot;sophisticated&quot; nowadays?<p>[0] - <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restrictions_on_geographic_data_in_China#GCJ-02"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restrictions_on_geographic_dat...</a>",1452883074

A federated, free software source code hosting tool could solve the barrier to entry problem without relinquishing control to a company who ultimately does not care about you.<p>And how about GitHub&#x27;s ToS?  Has anyone read it?  Probably not.  I didn&#x27;t when I signed up.  Did you know that changes to the ToS can happen any time and without notice?  Even if you did read the terms, by agreeing to them, you agree that they can completely change them.  Who would reasonably agree to that if it were not buried in legalese?  You also surrender your rights to a fair trial by defending and indemnifying GitHub.  For further reading, see &quot;Why I don&#x27;t support or contribute to GitHub repositories&quot; [0] or read the ToS for yourself.<p>Now, on a technical note: GitHub encourages bad development practices via hooking people on their web interface.  The Pull Request interface is the biggest offender.  It encourages unclean commit history because it&#x27;s scary to rewrite the patch set of a pull request.  If you rebase fixup commits, you have to force push the changes.  You cannot even do the safer route of deleting the remote branch and pushing the new branch because GitHub will automatically close the pull request with no way to re-open it.  So, most people just pile on fixup commits that never get squashed into decent patches.  And that&#x27;s not all!  The Pull Request interface makes it difficult to comment on individual patches by encouraging reviewers to look only at the aggregate diff of all patches.  This leads to lower patch quality because it leads to a bunch of terrible patches that look okay squashed together to enter the Git repository.  When your patch history sucks, it reduces the utility of blaming and bisecting to find issues or otherwise learn about the code.  Reviewing patch sets on a mailing list is, despite being &quot;low tech&quot;, a much better experience for me.  I&#x27;m not forced to use a web interface, I can just use the email client of my choosing, and Git already knows how to do an email-based workflow.  There&#x27;s a reason why a huge project like Linux still does patch review via email.<p>In conclusion, GitHub is a company that receives almost nothing but praise.  Most criticism is dismissed because they have a nice UX for a certain group of users (not me).  I think GitHub has harmed the free and open source software community both ethically, legally, and technically.  I no longer use GitHub for hosting my personal projects.  I write all of this in the hopes that more people will recognize this and work on real replacements for GitHub.<p>[0] <a href=""https://wubthecaptain.eu/articles/why-i-dont-support-github.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://wubthecaptain.eu/articles/why-i-dont-support-github....</a>",1452882386

The original open source manifesto (from RMS no less) was adamant that people should be <i>paid</i> for creating software, but once created it should be <i>free</i>. The idea being that the action of creating (or improving) the product had the value. But there has yet to be a break out mechanism for funding work on FOSS. Sure there are various attempts, Patreon or Flattr or something along those lines. But they are irregular and you cannot count on them.<p>Historically, infrastructure was funded by taxes on the users. You use the road, you pay road tax, and the road tax is used to pay people to keep the roads maintained. But there isn&#x27;t a FOSS tax which is then redistributed to the folks doing the work. There isn&#x27;t even a mechanism to make that possible. So using FOSS gives you tremendous advantage (work is done that you don&#x27;t have to do) but working on FOSS gives you no advantage (you don&#x27;t get paid for it and everyone else gets it for &quot;free&quot; when you are done.)<p>Perhaps the party is about to end, we shall see.",1452882329

At the very least they could hold Bitcoin hostage by merely &quot;threatening to threaten&quot; to do this, since any such threat could tank its value. Speculative markets are hypersensitive to FUD in the short term if that FUD is even a little bit credible, therefore anyone with the power to FUD a market has tremendous power to manipulate that market. (That&#x27;s why securities markets are studded with laws to try to prevent that... not that these laws work all that well.)<p>If other groups of super-rich/powerful elites wanted to control Bitcoin all they&#x27;d need to do is to buy similar levels of compute power and centralize it.

Today in America the AR-pattern rifle (the semi-automatic civilian version of the familiar full-auto-capable M-16 or M-4) is the most popular model of rifle, with millions sold in the past decade. Virtually all of them produced in the past decade have abandoned the old M-16’s signature “carrying handle” rear iron sight for a standardized sight mounting rail, meaning that virtually every AR sold today can be easily equipped with an efficient optical sight. Firing the high-velocity 5.56×45 mm cartridge and mounted with a four-power tactical sight, a typical AR rifle can shoot two-inch groups at one hundred yards when fired from a steady bench rest. That translates to shooting eight- to ten-inch groups at four hundred yards.<p>Four hundred yards is a long walk. Pace it off on a straight road, and observe how tiny somebody appears at that distance. Yet a typical AR rifle, like those currently owned by millions of American citizens, can hit a man-sized target at that range very easily, given a stable firing platform and a moderate level of shooting ability.<p>But what a lot of people don&#x27;t realize is there are a far greater number of scoped bolt-action hunting rifles in private hands in the United States. Keep this number in mind: based on deer stamps sold, approximately twenty million Americans venture into the woods every fall armed with such rifles, fully intending to shoot and kill a two-hundred-pound mammal. Millions of these scoped bolt-action deer rifles are quite capable of hitting a man-sized target at ranges out to and even beyond a thousand yards, or nearly three-fifths of a mile. In that context, the 500-yard effective range of the average semi-auto AR-pattern rifle is not at all remarkable.<p>I suppose what I&#x27;m getting at is that you don&#x27;t have to break the bank to arm your society in an effective way.  Your country will be doing just fine if most people simply have a bolt action scoped hunting rifle but what they really need is firearms training.",1452881659

There have been stories this week about Netflix cracking down on those who are circumventing region locking using VPNs. It seems big name shows are increasingly being offered via proprietary pay-per-view systems run by their production organisations, and centralised libraries like Netflix are either not carrying the material or dropping content they used to offer. We still have different release dates for movies in theatres in different countries, and for films and TV shows on DVD/Blu-ray. A recent trend seems to be for US TV shows not to release new seasons on Blu-ray at all here in the UK, so you can buy the lower quality version on DVD or you have to sign up for yet another online service to watch in HD, assuming you even have access to such a service from where you live. All of these measures are overtly consumer-hostile, but there is little the consumer who enjoys TV and movies can do if the entire industry moves that way (short of resorting to illegal channels and risking the consequences, which obviously is what a lot of people do in practice).<p>The software industry is similarly screwed up. We&#x27;ve gone from buying a copy of something and being able to use it, to buying a copy but needing remote activation, to buying a copy but needing varying degrees of ongoing online access to continue using it, to not even being able to buy a copy and merely renting. Personally I draw the line before I get that far, and refuse to pay for any important software unless I can reasonably expect it to continue working indefinitely. Even then, my businesses have been screwed repeatedly by varying degrees of ongoing online access or cutting off support, and slightly surprisingly, the most expensive professional software is by far the <i>worst</i> for this and for fixing the mess is something goes wrong.<p>I really hope that before too long the law starts to reflect the real relationships with modern technologies, where the original vendor who would traditionally be the main second party in a purchase contract is effectively just providing an introduction to the real other party, which is the organisation that makes the software/service and is (or isn&#x27;t) going to provide ongoing support and/or retain ongoing control over it. I also hope that smaller, disruptive software businesses who are starting to take on industry heavyweights can demonstrate that money talks and enough customers are willing to vote with their wallets for less one-sided arrangements. But for now, the possibility that industry heavyweights like Microsoft, Adobe and Autodesk are going to give up their vice-like grips built on DRM and related technologies seems more remote than ever, and all of them are pushing hard in the opposite direction.",1452881360

The company is convinced that with cars that almost but don’t drive themselves, humans will be lulled into devoting attention elsewhere and unable to take quick control in an emergency.</i><p>I think this is a really good perspective.

My opposition to vegetarianism mostly comes from some unusual experiences, but as far as eating &quot;factory farmed&quot; meat I think I probably just continue with that because of the social conditioning you mention.<p>Consider this:<p>1) I&#x27;m raising my own chickens right now. My wife coaxed a wild hen to start laying her clutch of eggs in a safe place that I defended from mongoose (an invasive species here), and we build a fenced area to protect them once hatched. Had we not done this, they almost certainly would have all been killed by mongoose. Some obviously do survive (there are wild chickens walking around), but the mortality rate is extremely high. I&#x27;m now in the process of butchering 6/7 of the roosters now that they are mature. In my opinion these roosters actually got the better end of the bargain. They had a good life outside, were fed well, and even got a chance to mate thanks to the huge amount of effort I put into keeping them safe and housing them. Even if I wanted to, I could not keep these 7 roosters as just pets as they would kill each other. What do you think of the morality of that?<p>2) I go out freediving and hunt and spear fish for food. It&#x27;s very hard to learn, and involves empathizing and understanding the personality of each different species I target. I do remove invasive species from the reef when I get a chance, but it&#x27;s not a mutualistic relationship like with the chickens. Still, it feels more &quot;right&quot; than eating meat out of a package because I&#x27;m experiencing a whole different aspect of life by joining part of the food chain. I have to look my prey in the eye, learn their habits and even take risks dealing with larger and stronger animals (sharks) that could eat me. The ethical relationship with those individual prey is maybe not positive, but I have a much better relationship with the environment around me that simply going out and observing via snorkeling doesn&#x27;t seem to provide.<p>I guess the point I&#x27;m making is that as I get closer to a natural relationship to animals as food, and away from packaged bodies in a supermarket, the less unethical it appears to me personally.",1452881066

A lot of them can talk about how if they hadn&#x27;t changed something, or if some event or realization hadn&#x27;t happened, that failure was imminent. Some of them talk about how they did fail, sometimes more than once, then tried something else and succeeded.<p>Unless you learn through trying that the idea really truly can&#x27;t work and there&#x27;s no market whatsoever (which I&#x27;d speculate is rare), it&#x27;s probably up to you to determine what success and failure actually mean, how to measure them, and what to do when they happen.<p>If you only have a strictly limited time or money budget, then not succeeding within the window is a type of failure, and maybe what most people mean by failure. But that doesn&#x27;t mean the idea won&#x27;t ever succeed, it just means it didn&#x27;t succeed <i>fast enough</i> for your budget. I&#x27;m guessing this is the functional definition of failure for most people.<p>Now the question is why, because it could have been for any number of reasons, market fit, skills, team, execution, timing, anything. This is why the trend in startup thinking is to perform activities that seek to answer questions about your business hypothesis, and find out why you&#x27;re failing, scientifically, before you fail.<p>If you can live on ramen forever, and your idea doesn&#x27;t cost much money to implement, and it makes you happy to keep trying, you might not ever need to declare a failure, you could indeed keep improving it.",1452880954

The company offers between 100 and 4500 euro to participate in trials (max earnings 4500 per year), though I don&#x27;t know what they offered for this particular trial.<p>We can wonder why people sign up for this when the only recompense offered is [a small amount of] money but its likely due to a desire for money, caused by a lack of it -- we can only suppose that if these folk had enough money already then they wouldn&#x27;t have signed up to this. It would be interesting to see the demographics of the participants of drug trials like these and I&#x27;m guessing that excess wealth and ennui aren&#x27;t significant features there.<p>Its always worth keeping in mind that choices which may seem to be unpalatable to you are likely to be much less so to other people for reasons they don&#x27;t necessarily have any control over.",1452880829

Layers of solid cobalt oxide used in the batteries could dissolve and leach out into the soil and ground water if large amounts of Li-ion batteries are disposed of in landfills.<p>I do not have a source for this, but given the relative abundance of lithium and ease of purifying salt deposits, it will be a long time before recycling lithium from spent Li-ion batteries would be cost effective. Lead isn&#x27;t rare at all, but large lead acid batteries are  easy to recycle. The lead mostly stays on the battery plates and isn&#x27;t mixed in with other metals. Besides, there are laws that make disposing of lead more expensive than recycling it.",1452880824

4701925,comment,4701321,4701321,6,0,Su-Shee,,,"I suggest reading very carefully.<p>I absolutely believe what he writes, because he's quite precise about his experiment and how he did it and this really works for a couple of reasons:<p>* This guy isn't 20 anymore. He has actually explored and learned and trained ""productivity and focus"" which he blogs and writes books about - so he doesn't start like a 18 year old directly from school, unexperienced maybe in this level of focus and discipline.<p>* He was pragmatic in his goals - very much so. He didn't write ""becoming the world's foremost expert in linear algebra"" but ""passing an exam"". And so he did. He also didn't write ""passing everything with a top grade"" but ""just pass, if better - wonderful"".<p>* He actually did his math on ""hours to put in"" - a semester doesn't take full 6 months, you usally don't attend lectures/lab every day 3 hours a day but 1-2 times a week, 2 (university) hours plus preparation. If you carefully add this up, you actually get a surprisingly low count of actual course/lesson hours.<p>* Taking in a course in a focused manner is actually quite efficient and helps you (at least it does for me) follow the material without interruptions. You also can repeat as often as you like (he mentions a fast forward and replay button in his TEDx talk) - which btw. makes part of the success of e.g. Khan university material.<p>* He also put some effort and training into the right way of learning and _that_ pays off massively in terms of speed.<p>Also, one of the points he is actually making is part of what most of you critizise: Going through the list of MIT requirements is something different compared to ""becoming an expert in X"" - don't mix that up.",1351256102

4701922,comment,4701454,4701777,2,0,jlouis,,,"I would think so. It has many of the properties you would like in implementing a database system. First, the language is statically typed and executes surprisingly quickly. Second, it can handle high concurrency which is needed in a database since you will have many clients connection. Third, the libraries letting you interface with protobufs and HTTP provides two pretty simple ways to connect your Database interface to the rest of the world.<p>The perhaps most glaring problem, compared to the world of Erlang where I come from, is the lack of built-in seamless distribution. Many NoSQL databases trades consistency for availability and more machines. You are on your own implementing this.<p>Also, the lack of a ZooKeeper-like library may be something you will end up implementing. That, or perhaps the basis of the Dynamo paper.",1351256038

At least, that's it in my case. Pascal is the one I'd describe Go as being closest to -- but then I've never been a C programmer.<p>As for Pythonists and scripters, not sure they'd ever be that happy in Go.

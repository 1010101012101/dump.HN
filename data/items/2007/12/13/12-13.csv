Just bundle a portable LCD projector and an infrared sensor together and include software so it just works. Get a good team together and apply to Y Combinator.",1197550026

It is still on a very early stage, we have only seen what it can provide. I think that there is plenty of room for new web startups!",1197549872

I take this as a sign that the hacker community is unanimous in condemnation of our disenfranchisement.<p>Is there anything we can do about it? Or does it take millions of dollars to have any impact in America anymore?",1197549750

89122,comment,89048,89120,0,0,marcus,,,"True, but it all depends on the way the individual claims are written in the patents governing multi-touch systems. If they have separated the claims for determining touch points and for the using different touch points to control zoom for example it might still be a problem, need to read the patent claims carefully to be sure.",1197549026
89121,comment,89055,89077,0,0,luis,,,"Not sure whether people's wants - and needs - are unlimited in  the short term. In fact they are probably limited by what people themselves perceive is a want or a need, what they know and experience, and their ability to assimilate and absorb new technology. In the long term though...",1197548810

89119,comment,88898,88898,0,0,jgrahamc,,,"This post makes the mistake of assuming that reddit and similar sites actually implement ""wisdom of crowds"".  They don't.   They don't because you get to see the 'most popular' answers and choose from those to vote on, if you really wanted WoC to work you'd need to present people random stories to vote on.  (This is part of what I attempted to do in my <a href=""<a href=""http://www.jgc.org/blog/2007/09/wildfire-has-launched.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jgc.org/blog/2007/09/wildfire-has-launched.html</a>"">Wildfire</a> Facebook application).<p>He also proposes Bayesian filtering as a suitable technique for presenting the recommended page.  Despite that fact that I'm a Bayesian-head (see <a href=""<a href=""http://getpopfile.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://getpopfile.org/</a>"">POPFile</a> for example) I don't think that's a total solution.  You can do ML for news (it's an old idea, see the 20 newsgroups test set for example) and I have a private 'reddit' which I use as a feed reader that does ML.  <p>But I think if you want to solve the 'reddit problem' you actually need to give people the chance to control the 'crowd' that they are getting recommendations from.  I'd like to see (actually, I am building) an application that's reddit-like, but uses a combination of ML and social aspects to get a better view of interesting stories.<p>Some of this I wrote about <a href=""<a href=""http://www.jgc.org/blog/2007/09/problems-with-social-news.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jgc.org/blog/2007/09/problems-with-social-news.ht...</a>"">here</a>.",1197548027

89116,comment,89055,89055,0,0,eusman,,,"Your measures in comparison are totally wrong. <p>Retail products are totally different than software as service which is free. Thus the barrier for the user to try new stuff on the internet is zero comparing to buying something.<p>Also, the barrier to create automobile technology it's obvious very high and discouraging. However, enough costly innovation is occuring from the existing companies. Hubrid cars are becoming reality.\nA model car from sketch to manufacturing to get in the roads is at least a 5 year effort. Compare that to developing an app in 2 months!",1197547392

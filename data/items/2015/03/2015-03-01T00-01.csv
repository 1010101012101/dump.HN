How much of that 20k could a developer actually expect to take home?<p>To give an example, I live in Seattle in the US (which is relevant as many states in the US apply additional taxes on top of those applied federally). My effective tax rate is probably somewhere around 35-40% of my gross income. I&#x27;m curious if devs in the UK are looking at a similar deal, or if more than half of that 20k per month is going to evaporate into taxes... also how does that vary for contract versus permanent work (in the US it would cause an immediate 7.5% bump in my tax rate, I believe).",1425171519

He&#x27;s expressing an opinion about code from Rails developers which is about as broad as opinions go this side of saying &quot;black people are like X&quot; or &quot;Asians are like Y.&quot; On the bright side he does leave the door open that Rails developers could write solid code though most don&#x27;t in his opinion. The best thing you could do is continue working on Rails but read a variety of opinions on good code in different languages, read Coders at Work and similar texts on coding, and remember not to blindly follow coding trends. Generally keep your code simple and work to find abstractions to fit your domain.<p>I&#x27;m not saying anyone here is incorrect in their generalizations of Rails developers. I&#x27;ve obviously never seen the code they are criticizing. But they also aren&#x27;t providing any useful information. Keep that in mind above all else.

Burying opt-out phone home behaviour in nothing but legalese small print is a dark pattern. Having no way to disable it without going into obscure parts of the UI that no normal user (or even normal power-user) is ever likely to find is also a dark pattern.<p>Again, I appreciate your taking the time to share the links, but this is still a screw-up if Mozilla are trying to convince people they care about privacy. I don&#x27;t think anyone can effectively defend general purpose software that includes covert, opt-out surveillance in any form in 2015.

For example, many if not most freelance marketplaces are particularly concerned with any significant information about the jobs being made available outside of the official sites. Also, jobs can be posted as semi-public where they can be viewed only when logged in. To remain legal, it would be necessary to consult carefully each source site&#x27;s EULA.<p>It would be very important to give a median score rather than a mean score.

That said, if the engagement is something like &quot;meet with our team for a day and give us feedback on XYZ initiative&quot; it&#x27;s hard not to have some linkage between hours and deliverable. (Though we would also throw in reports/follow-up/etc. to blur the linkage to some degree.) Ditto for giving a presentation. Funnily enough though, these types of engagements were actually the ones that brought in the most money per hour spent because they involved high value in-person interactions rather than just creating a written document.<p>EDIT: And sometimes, billing has to be done per hour for various reasons.

I tried vegan baking in the distant past, and was always disappointed, but the Internet has made it really easy to find good, proven, recipes and a lot more information about the science and behavior of foods when prepared in various ways.<p>I&#x27;ve been pleasantly surprised by how well my coconut oil-based cookies and biscuits come out. My current biscuit recipe (<a href=""http://foodcite.org/recipe/amazing-vegan-southern-buttermilk-biscuits/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://foodcite.org/recipe/amazing-vegan-southern-buttermilk...</a> ) is as good as any I have ever made...and I&#x27;m from the south. I know biscuits, and have made and eaten a lot of biscuits in my life. Cakes and brownies are another story, thus far, and it&#x27;s not the butter that&#x27;s the problem ingredient; eggs are where the problems come in.<p>I&#x27;m really impressed with their experimental approach. I&#x27;ve done the same experiments with curdling non-dairy milks (to replace buttermilk in biscuits), and have done several experiments blending various oils and additional ingredients to replicate butter. Because I&#x27;m lazy I ended up simplifying back down to very easy to prepare ingredients, because if there are too many steps or ingredients, I end up cooking something simpler.

The purpose of government is not to delegate decision-making to others, but to join together the power of individuals to accomplish goals that they could not together, and to protect the weak many from the strong few.<p>I agree that people frequently ignore issues that they perceive as too big or out of their control. Sometimes this is a rational assessment of the situation. Sometimes it&#x27;s an abdication of personal responsibility.<p>I disagree that the position you identify as &#x27;individualist&#x27; is associated with a willingness to debate, or to use rational arguments. Some of the most rational thinkers I&#x27;ve ever read were communists, and some of the lowest emotional sloganeering I&#x27;ve read was from self-proclaimed libertarians. Emotional and rational arguments are used by every political faction, and the use of emotional arguments is not a sign of weakness. Humans are emotional creatures and they are rational creatures, and there is nothing wrong with engaging with people on an emotional level.<p>I appreciate this response, even though I disagree with it.

&quot;Students are then obligated to attend that residency program. They can’t privately negotiate with other programs, as students can for, say, undergrad admissions, or med school admissions—or almost any other normal employment situation.&quot;<p>However, the key to the program (the algorithm was discussed on hn a few months ago I think??) is that a medical student can only be matched to a residency that THEY listed as an acceptable choice of employer, and where the residency listed THEM as an acceptable choice of resident. Medical students are also free to try to negotiate with residencies (before the ranking deadline)...and residency programs as just as free to say &#x27;No&#x27;. I think it&#x27;s reasonable for the hospital to promise a set period of residency training, with all pay and conditions specified up front, but only on the condition that the incoming resident makes the commitment to stay for the full program.<p>The resident can leave simply by giving their notice: what they are unlikely to be able to do is find another residency willing to take them on, when they&#x27;ve just broken their previous commitment.

This will reduce consumption and investment in the larger economy, inducing a recession or depression until overall demand for currency fell, pushing those who hold it to spend or invest to avoid losses. Of course, that equilibrium won&#x27;t be permanent, and the cycle would begin a new, but with the major disadvantage that central banks nor government monetary policy can reduce the severity of the swings.

What this roughly translates to is writing code and having it be turned into SQL by the ORM and only querying the database once the entire query has been built.<p>- Better sockets integration<p>- Integrated cache<p>I think this should speak volumes about Sails&#x27; readiness for production. I don&#x27;t mean to harp on Balderdashy, they&#x27;ve done great work - but there&#x27;s so much more to do. Right now if I wanted to start a new project I&#x27;d have a hard time choosing Sails over Laravel. They may be different languages but for many use cases I&#x27;ve seen the same or better performance from Laravel on HHVM. I honestly don&#x27;t know how anyone can say they&#x27;re loving it in production while these problems have remained unsolved. Every time I need to do something in my Sails application that strays from the most basic of operations, I end up having to write raw SQL or write a module in order to use sockets in any meaningful way. Personally, I&#x27;ll be sticking to smaller Node.js libraries for a while yet. Not because I think Sails is bad, but because it&#x27;s simply not ready.",1425168428

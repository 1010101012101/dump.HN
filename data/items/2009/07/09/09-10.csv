""Mike Arrington is a doody-head! Hah hah!  Poop!""<p>Were one to look at his actual point, one might also go back 30 years and wonder if those silly upstarts at Microsoft with their ""pee sees"" have a chance against serious mainframes, with the millions of lines of code already written for them.",1247133063

There is a huge communication gap between (bio)wet-lab and (bio)informaticians, and I think 'data science' tools can help to bridge that gap.",1247132275

Think about it. At the moment we are constrained to HTML, CSS and JavaScript. With the technologies being put together by Google you can easily have downloadable native applications that run through Chrome.<p>I'm doubting that Google is just going to make another net kiosk distribution.

695516,comment,694645,694645,0,0,jasonkester,,,"No, the only thing that happened is that lots of people bought things they couldn't afford and, unsurprisingly, couldn't pay for them.  That's it.<p>It doesn't help at all to blame banks for this.  It's readily apparent that if you purchase a house, regardless of the terms, you will eventually need to pay for a house.  It's not rocket surgery.  The corollary to this is that ""if you can't afford a house, don't buy a house.""  Anybody ignoring that simple fact is likely to run out of money.<p>Many of us realized this, didn't buy things we couldn't afford, and therefore still have money.  It's amazing that people would expect to blame some random 3rd party for their own foolishness.<p><a href=""http://www.hulu.com/watch/1389/saturday-night-live-dont-buy-stuff"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hulu.com/watch/1389/saturday-night-live-dont-buy-...</a>",1247131458

Hurling clever insults is easy there are a million writers who can do it but to create a piece of informative, interesting, relevant content, not so much. Calling out Michael Arrington like that...was kind of unprofessional. But I do like Dziuba's writing and also of course Verity Stob.",1247131378

I just read on HN about a week ago about Google bragging about how since all their sites run on the same underlying architecture, one upgrade and all their sites get the upgrade (speed, scalability, etc.).<p>But it seems to have turned around in this case.

What kind of accountant would make that kind of basic error?<p>It beggars belief that the guy could run a successful business for 20 years, but could not understand the difference between receivables and booked work. He was probably boosting cashflow to keep the banks happy, then one day they figured it out and shut him down. Otherwise he would have surely been able to get loans for that vital ""equipment"".<p>Ah well, happens all the time. I feel sorry for the guy but he should have been more careful.",1247130867

My second choice of course was a masters in information science, which looks very similar to the vlis one.<p>I think data science is a very broad subject area that covers the science of organising information (information science and vlis), right through to information visualisation.<p>Information science would have given me a good grounding in the skills I need for my start-up (which is involved in organising research information), but I thought it would be best to build on my expertise and interests (design, HCI, UX, psychology) and team up with someone who knows a lot more about the technical side of building information systems - more than I could ever learn from a one year masters.<p>It sounds like we are starting at opposite ends of the data/information science spectrum; it will be interesting to see if we meet in the middle after our masters.",1247130680

The criticism was, more or less, that it was like the British navy before WW I, where officers were promoted based on how clean they kept their ships.<p>(Lots of money go into the army and lots of equipment is bought -- and these days have almost no units ready. There is talk about changing this a bit.)<p>I'm not going to claim that Swedish politicians are supernaturally prescient or anything, but... the last time the Swedish military was closed down since it obviously would never be needed, was in the 1920s.

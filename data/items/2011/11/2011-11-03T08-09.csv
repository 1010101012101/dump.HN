So for example, an admin could change /etc/nsswitch.conf to set up LDAP user logins but your application could still use getpwnam(3) without caring about whether the pw retrieved is local, NIS, or LDAP.",1320309219

It can be right clicked to see the document's location in the file system and open any of the references locations.<p>And if you're talking about conditioning, perhaps you should considering not using Alt-Tab, a task switcher that has never really worked properly, because it cannot be both memorable, linear and context-adaptive.<p>Those shiny OS X windows that fly around without lag allow me to task switch visually, using touch gestures.

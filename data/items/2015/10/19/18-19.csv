Not <i>necessarily</i> binary analysis, but more along the lines of knowing who you&#x27;re getting your tools from, reputation, whatever, etc.<p>Because as far as I, a user is concerned, that developer put that software on my phone.<p>Maybe I as a user have a similar due diligence burden. One thing I might do is never download an app from the affected developers again. But that doesn&#x27;t seem like a desired outcome.

The fact that on payday the founder ways honeymooning doesn&#x27;t change that.

A person who was fired for wrongdoing can&#x27;t be expected to be objective in reporting something about the former employer, even if they aren&#x27;t trying to deceive. If that person&#x27;s report is relayed, but the firing is concealed, the journalist is effectively concealing that bias.<p>Of course, Jay Carney (Senior Vice President for Global Corporate Affairs at Amazon) has an obvious bias as well.<p>It&#x27;s not clear whom to believe in this particular case---but biases and track records of fraud <i>are</i> generally relevant context.",1445280952

In Go, you don&#x27;t get a compile error when you miss some fields while initializing a struct. e.g.<p><pre><code>  type T struct {\n    a int\n    b string\n    c float64\n  }\n  \n  t := T{c: 1.5}\n</code></pre>\nwill happily set `t.a` to 0 and `t.b` to an empty string. While this is useful for maintaining backward compatibility (adding more fields to a struct doesn&#x27;t break upstream code), it also hinders discovering genuine mistakes at compile time. So typical Go programs end up using 0 or an empty string as a sentinel value. This is probably what made me feel Go&#x27;s dynamic nature the most.

If I had to summarize it, I would say that Windows gave us a culture in which software vendors were able to decouple themselves from individual hardware vendors.

A lot of PCs have simple Intel-HDA audio controllers that don&#x27;t have hardware-level separate streams. You need a software defined mixer that will share the resource with several applications. For years and years on Linux the situation was that you do get direct hardware access and it sucked balls. Either your card has hardware mixing and you can play like 8 sounds at once, or it doesn&#x27;t and you can&#x27;t. In that time, at least 3 different userspace mixers appeared, all incompatible with each other, which of course means that your choice of Gnome vs KDE also dictates which music players you can use.<p>The OS absolutely needs to define standard usage APIs so we don&#x27;t end up in the situation where everybody rolls their own.

If you&#x27;re traveling with 40 guys (the realistic minimum that you could take to field a team), that gets expensive pretty fast. A true minor league could probably work if the NFL teams agreed to subsidize it, and they put it in a single major metro area. Like, the NFL has a 4 team minor league in Dallas, and did a lot of community marketing, played on high school fields, etc. You could build a single gym/practice facility, and the teams could rotate around in it. The problems are that you start to get into affiliation issues (what major teams are affiliated with what minor teams, and what does a major team do when it wants to send down a CB, but there are no teams that play man press with open slots for a CB?) and the fact that football is much, much more a team game than baseball or basketball, and most players need a couple weeks in the system to really make an impact, whereas a baseball player can get traded from one team to another with minimal adjustment, and a skilled basketball player won&#x27;t need much more time.<p>The other issue is that there already is a sort of minor league, it&#x27;s called the practice squad. And if you have minor leagues, the practice squad guys are in a weird limbo, because they are not getting game reps like they would in a minor league, yet they are the guys just good enough to almost be NFL players who would benefit the least from game reps, because of the work they are putting in with the full team. There are actually many minor football leagues, most playing indoor football, and those guys almost never make it to the NFL.<p>For the NFL, the real solution isn&#x27;t a minor league, it&#x27;s doubling the practice squad. That could cost each team about... (using numbers from the article) $1.5 million, and that&#x27;s probably the best solution if the powers-that-be really feel there is a talent gap.",1445279002

10414567,comment,10411982,10414110,0,0,exelius,,,"And by far the most important factor in making a professional league is genetics. Height is the biggest X factor in sports, and nearly every position in sports favors players who are taller and have longer limbs (yeah, yeah, strikers in soccer and NFL running backs can be short as long as they&#x27;re incredibly quick). At the pro level, every player is coached to play as close to their maximum potential as is physically possible. All things held equal, a taller player simply has a greater maximum potential.<p>Colt McCoy is one of my favorite examples. Coming out of college, he was a prototypical NFL pocket passer: he made smart decisions, had a quick release, was incredibly accurate, had great presence in the pocket and was deceptively fast when he had to pull it down and run. But he&#x27;s been a career backup because he&#x27;s only 6&#x27;1&quot;, and for various reasons, it&#x27;s hard to be a franchise NFL quarterback under 6&#x27;4&quot;. If you look at all the best quarterbacks in the last 20 years, nearly every one is 6&#x27;4&quot; or taller [1]. While there are a couple exceptions (namely, Aaron Rodgers and Drew Brees) nearly every single &quot;marquee&quot; quarterback still playing today is 6&#x27;4&quot; or taller. If Colt McCoy were 3 inches taller, he would almost certainly be a starter in the NFL today. Imagine how much better Aaron Rodgers or Drew Brees would have been if they were 3 inches taller.<p>6&#x27;4&quot; is <i>really</i> tall. In the US, that puts you into the top 1% of height for males. [2] So not only do you have to be really good at the sport, but being really good at the sport essentially requires you to be in the top 1% of the country in physical size before you even pick up a ball. I knew a kid in middle school who was 6&#x27;4&quot; and everyone knew he was going to end up in the NBA. And he did -- for like 4 seasons before his knees gave out. But those are the kids who go pro -- everyone they&#x27;ve known since the age of 12 or so has been telling them they&#x27;ll go pro because they were always the biggest, best player on every team they ever played on.<p>The odds for any given kid playing pro sports are probably much closer to zero than anyone wants to admit. Those odds only improve if the kid&#x27;s parents are tall -- and even then only if the kid ends up being tall, in shape, with no genetic weaknesses in connective tissue that would cause too many injuries before they hit the pro level.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.coldhardfootballfacts.com/content/tall-task-does-height-matter-for-nfl-quarterbacks/22067/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.coldhardfootballfacts.com/content/tall-task-does-...</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhsr/nhsr010.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhsr/nhsr010.pdf</a>, page 16",1445278314

This pushes into the conspiracy area though, you&#x27;d have to have an entire chain of staff (at least in a company the size of Amazon) that couldn&#x27;t <i>not</i> know this had occurred, and somehow convince them all to be silent. Not impossible, just unlikely.<p>3. If the company is releasing info about whatever occurred, an NDA would no longer apply. Why would it? The information is now public knowledge.<p>This I definitely agree with, when employees are found to be stealing it should be handled like any other matter; call the cops and let the process handle itself.

Signal processing and a lot of other tasks come down to manipulating large arrays of data using similar operations across the entire array.  Although Octave is interpreted, these kinds of operations execute very nicely inside Octave.  Octave also lets you write those kinds of operations at a very high level, like a = b * c, and under the covers it&#x27;s doing millions of operations.<p>If you&#x27;d like to give Octave a try and learn about Machine Learning at the same time, try this excellent and fun free course! <a href=""https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning</a><p>One of the later lessons in that class is a mind-blowing signal processing thing. In that exercise, they show how you can put multiple mics in a room, with multiple people talking over each other, and the computer separates out the different sources of sounds, and outputs a clean wav file for each sound source with the sounds isolated from each other.  It blew my mind, and was implemented in Octave.  And they teach you exactly how to do it yourself.<p>All the above concepts can, of course, be done in C++ or NumPy or whatever, they just use Octave to teach the course.",1445277826

The idea being that page turns really suck when you play any instrument that takes two hands (we're both violinists), and if you could hook it up to a foot pedal, you could control the music without putting down your instrument.  I also pointed out that a digital music stand would cost at least as much as a computer, but now that you can get laptops for $98, this may be doable...<p>Plus, think of all the people on YouTube that you see lean over to stop recording.  If it doesn't already exist, software to control a webcam through a foot pedal would be a great boon to YouTubers everywhere.  The porn industry would love it too - that bra unclasp is so much sexier when she's not blatantly fiddling with her webcam.",1221188113

My typing speed went from 70 WPM to about 75-80.  That's not all that much of a difference, and much of it may be attributable to Dvorak.<p>I really don't think it makes that much of a difference, as long as you're not hunt-and-peck.<p>Incidentally, my speed now is about 55 WPM because the T and M keys on my lapop are broken and often don't regiser.

302024,comment,301913,301919,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"<i>What he essentially suggests is that Javascript is becoming powerful enough to eliminate the current need for server side languages.</i><p>I think it's obvious that JavaScript is as powerful a language as Ruby, on the ""blub"" spectrum, anyway.  Where it fails is on connecting to the underlying OS--breaking out of the VM and doing something with the system, which is something that Ruby (and Perl, from which Ruby inherited most of this stuff) has in spades.<p>That said, when (not if) JavaScript gets a reasonable FFI and good ties to the underlying OS, on the order of Ruby, Python, and Perl, it will be the obvious choice for implementing just about everything.  Faster implementations (V8 and Tracemonkey are faster for many classes of problem than any of the current dynamic language kings, and on par with Smalltalk) mean that once the ""plays well with others"" problem is solved sufficiently, there will be little reason to choose Ruby/Python/Perl except ""I like it better""...and, though I do happen to like Ruby, Perl, and Python a lot, I also find JavaScript a very pretty language with a lot of power.<p>If it gets block scope (which Ruby also doesn't really have, I think?), and the previously mentioned FFI and OS integration, I will have nothing else to complain about (except the DOM).",1221186368

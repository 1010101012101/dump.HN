No, because he would be dead. On mission critical systems you make damn well sure in advance you have a backup plan (or more if needed). John should have bought an extra set of medicines, and AWS should have had better backup plans - it seems to me that if it's taking so long to bring the systems up, there must be something not really well thought of there.",1303502393

Nutrition in the Treatment of Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder: A Neglected but Important Aspect<p>""Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is multidetermined and complex, requiring a multifaceted treatment approach. Nutritional management is one aspect that has been relatively neglected to date. Nutritional factors such as food additives, refined sugars, food sensitivities/allergies, and fatty acid deficiencies have all been linked to ADHD. There is increasing evidence that many children with behavioral problems are sensitive to one or more food components that can negatively impact their behavior. Individual response is an important factor for determining the proper approach in treating children with ADHD. In general, diet modification plays a major role in the management of ADHD and should be considered as part of the treatment protocol.""<p>Applied Psychophysiology and Biofeedback - <a href=""http://www.springerlink.com/content/vr40331382376623/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.springerlink.com/content/vr40331382376623/</a><p>3. Blunted catecholamine responses after glucose ingestion in children with attention deficit disorder.<p>""Eating simple sugars has been suggested as having adverse behavioral and cognitive effects in children with attention deficit disorder (ADD), but a physiologic mechanism has not been established. To address this issue, metabolic, hormonal, and cognitive responses to a standard oral glucose load (1.75 g/kg) were compared in 17 children with ADD and 11 control children. Baseline and oral glucose-stimulated plasma glucose and insulin levels were similar in both groups, including the nadir glucose level 3-5 h after oral glucose (3.5 +/- 0.2 mmol/L in ADD and 3.3 +/- 0.2 mmol/L in control children). The late glucose fall stimulated a rise in plasma epinephrine that was nearly 50% lower in ADD than in control children (1212 +/- 202 pmol/L versus 2228 +/- 436 pmol/L, p < 0.02). Plasma norepinephrine levels were also lower in ADD than in control children, whereas growth hormone and glucagon concentrations did not differ between the groups. Matching test scores were lower and reaction times faster in ADD than in control children before and after oral glucose, and both groups showed a deterioration on the continuous performance test in association with the late fall in glucose and rise in epinephrine. These data suggest that children with ADD have a general impairment of sympathetic activation involving adrenomedullary as well as well as central catecholamine regulation.""<p>Department of Pediatrics, Yale University School of Medicine - <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8559606"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8559606</a>",1303501527

So we wanted to grow kinda slowly so we could manage it effectively.<p>Our strategy then was to reach out to editors or writers of smaller sites that seemed like they were in our milieu, and see if any of them showed any interest. I think we contacted...30 or 40 editors.<p>We actually didn't get any coverage at all, which was really disheartening. But we kept plugging away on the site and the app, adding a couple additional features. In the meanwhile I kept sending out emails, filling out forms. Users kept trickling in.<p>We also started using our own app ourselves, sending out Momentomails to our friends and to each other. Making sure the service was live and validating the idea...building up expected user patterns, establishing acceptable levels of service quality...etc.<p>One thing we found slightly disturbing, was the large number of sites that offer different levels of review prioritization depending on if you email them and expect some free coverage, or if you pay them. And I suppose I can see how that could be an interesting revenue channel, but if I wanted to pay somebody to cover me, I'd probably just buy ad space...so it felt kinda scammish and we decided not to do that. Our service should either be interesting and useful on its own, or we should keep working on it until it is.<p>On a whim, I decided to send out a contact to some bigger sites, Lifehacker being one of them. Still nothing.<p>About two weeks after submitting to Lifehacker, this happened: <a href=""http://lifehacker.com/#!5787941/momentomail-sends-messages-from-gmail-or-yahoo-accounts-in-the-future"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lifehacker.com/#!5787941/momentomail-sends-messages-f...</a><p>I'm not sure how much getting covered on Apr 1st hurt us or not (we answered a few user contacts answering if we were real or not). But we had a massive spike in new traffic. Massive. We couldn't even see some of our previous spikes on the graph it was so huge. We floated around the top 10 hot sites on LH for two or three days so the spike extended out for awhile.<p>So far, LH has been the only major site to cover us, but it's let us observe how things spread on the internet. If you search for Momentomail in google, you'll find dozens of pages where we show up, almost all reposts or links to LH's story. A few tweets bounced around the tweetosphere...(or whatever it's called)...and very interesting -- foreign translations of the LH post, showing up a few days later, sent us echos of the initial spike.<p>Suddenly a rush of Italian users, or Turkish users, or Indonesian users. We haven't gotten the metrics yet, but anecdotally, it looks like about 20% of our new signups are now coming from Spanish language countries...which is pretty exciting.<p>It's definitely slowed down, and we're still kind of processing all this new traffic, but there's a steady stream of new signups everyday. We've found a few bugs were squashing. Once we add a couple planned (and highly requested features) we'll probably go around and recontact many of the sites that we contacted before...but also the sites that carried our story from the initial Lifehacker story.<p>In case anybody is interested, some fun notes: we run on GAE, and we had our quota set to a cap of about $5/day, before the LH story, we'd barely even showed up on the quota data (we'd only been using the free service). The week of the LH story, the quotas showed some activity, but we never broke Google's free quota. So our hosting fees so far on GAE are $0. It's definitely a cost effective way to bootstrap a new product. (though secretly we hope to have to ""good problem"" of having to increase our quota cap).",1303501325

2475121,comment,2473932,2473932,1,0,kerkeslager,,,"> <i>In contrast, in a GC system where you do _not_ have access to the explicit refcounting, you tend to always copy the node, just because you don't know if the original node might be shared through another tree or not. Even if sharing ends up not being the most common case. So you do a lot of extra work, and you end up with even more cache pressure.</i><p>It's possible that things were different in 2002, but I don't really think this is the case now. In general, I make the node immutable and never copy it (copying an immutable object makes no sense). In a well-designed code base, mutations happen within the function where the data is created (read: on the stack, where cache locality is a given). Immutability also addresses Linus' concerns with thread-safety. And that's not accounting for concerns which Linus DOESN'T mention, such as increased development speed and correct program behavior.<p>I'm not the only one saying this. Josh Bloch, for example, recommends immutability and cites cache reasons (<a href=""http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-jtp02183/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-jtp02183/in...</a>). And many languages (Haskell, Clojure) are designed heavily around avoiding mutation and sharing nodes within data structures.<p>This talk of copying nodes to avoid your objects changing out from under you sounds a lot like what I call ""writing C in Java"". Linus is looking at this from the perspective of, ""If they took away explicit memory management from C, this is how I would do it."" But OF COURSE if you just bolt a feature like GC into a language that didn't have it before, it won't work well. Effective cache usage in a GCed system requires other language constructs (like immutability).<p>Now, after all that, I won't make the claim that immutability in a GCed language like Java or C# is faster or even as fast as C with explicit memory management: it would take a lot of profiling code and comparing its functionality to make that claim with any kind of certainty. But it doesn't seem like Linus has done that profiling and comparison either.",1303499987

2475080,comment,2474458,2474893,2,0,chuhnk,,,"A functional DR and usually the most optimal are the ones that require the least amount of work when disaster strikes. If our the datacenter in which our servers are hosted is destroyed I do not want to be figuring what hardware to restore databases on, where to deploy applications, what to use as load balancers, or what IPs to point my dns records to, what ad hoc config changes I had on a server somewhere. It should all have been preplanned, 80% of that should already have been done. We've got a 100mbit line running into the office. We've got staging servers, database servers and just crap loads of hardware thats used internally which would instantly become our server farm. Databases are being replicated as we speak, those that cannot are being incrementally backed up and restored. I've got a DR dns zone file ready to go, the ttl on dns records is 1800. If you had to do this stuff from scratch yes it would take time. But any credible business that runs online should have these things in place. If you're idea of a backup is your mirrored RAID I feel bad for you.<p>Does the size of their site matter? Perhaps. Does it require 10 engineers to get a DR strategy going and be able to implement it? No. If you clearly plan this ahead of time, if all the pieces are in place then no it will not take that many. If I was to take into account multiple pieces of infrastructure it could still be done. DR is not about getting the exact same infrastructure up. Its about keeping the business running, its about staying alive and in those situations usually you try the minimal that will get you there. Do I really need my back end reporting and emailing systems when shit hits the fan? No. Messages will queue up and when those systems come online later they'll take care of it.<p>Am I simplifying it? Perhaps so lets take an example.<p>In your current infrastructure you've got 100 servers, you got a couple load balancers, 40 webservers, 30-40 app servers and 20 database servers. Load balancers a dummy HA thing where something like haproxy, nginx, keepalived, lvs or something else runs, the second one is just the backup that takes over when the first dies. Those are static configs that dont take much to get up and running somewhere else. 40 webservers. So in my place of work each webserver is identical and any one of those can go down without affecting the other. Usually thats varnish, nginx, apache or something of the like in the front end maybe proxying off to rails apps, php or python. Each server has no dependency except on the database. Got some mid caching layer like memcached? Ok well you'd have one per webserver in a cluster and those things drop in and out with ease. App servers follow suit if you know how to build systems that are not tightly coupled and deal with asynchronous requests. Alot of it comes down to queues and message passing. Obviously there are some inter dependencies which you cant help and if you can solve some of it with intermediary haproxy balancing then great. So far I feel like all of these things can easily be setup on servers anywhere else and code can be frequently updated.<p>The real complexity is in data stores. I assume in companies with more than 20 machines they may have chosen multiple datastores for different purposes so it doesnt all live in one place. Yes that adds to the difficulty of things but you  have to break things down and work on each one at a time. If you're smart you'll have used something that can be replicated, has multi master or is clustered in most cases you dont even have to worry about it because almost every popular datastore these days have those capabilities. Lets look at mysql. Most of the time people go with basic master slave replication and move to master with multiple slaves so you can offload reads. If you're replicating within the one place then theres no reason you cant replicate offsite to your warm standby. If you do maintain that offsite slave then you've got an upto the minute copy of your database in the event of catastrophic failure. Now thats one database down, what if your using redis, well that also has replication so I'm not seeing a problem there either. Mongodb, cassandra, oracle, it really doesnt matter what it is because you can maintain a copy.<p>At the end of the day its about planning, its about taking the time to already have 80% of the work done and getting the major pieces up and running. Theres no excuse. There really isnt. You think facebook's in one datacenter? Yea at one point they were but back then you really think they didnt have a backup plan? Ok they are big with lots of people but honestly I dont care if you've got 10 different datastores (dont do that) and each is half a terabyte on disk. I dont care what the complexity is, if you think its too complex to have a running backup thats your fault. Imagine google said, ""eh yea the application is a bit complicated and we really cant have a backup somewhere else"". What?!<p>Migrations, if you have no plan and are doing it from scratch yes that takes time. It took me a month from start to finish and thats only because I spent the first two trying to figure out how to get chef to automate most of it. But that was a migration and I had the luxury of time. If it was a DR scenario I'd have at max 8-10 hours before the MD would be yelling at me. Put all your databases on servers somewhere else, get the code up and running and have a strategy for switching.",1303499357

2475045,comment,2474970,2474970,5,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Those are great questions. Similar questions I've asked during funding and M&A interviews;<p><i>What do you not yet know, how are you developing information about that?</i><p>This is knowing what is risky and what isn't. Some problems are just 'engineering' you do work and get them done. Others need 'new physics' which is code for an imagined but not yet designed feature or capability to work. Too many of the latter can be a real problem.<p><i>How many people do you think you'll need to realize this vision? How many to keep it current?</i><p>One of the more sad failure modes of startups is over hiring. More people can be good, too many people is really bad, understanding what the people requirement is can bite you if you don't get it right.<p><i>How will customers find you? What does it cost you to be visible to them?</i><p>Customer acquisition, especially in a demographic that doesn't congregate (small/medium business fits this category) can be unduly expensive. If you have a product that would sell like gang busters at $X but it costs $X + $Y dollars to get a customer, you need to fund to <i>n</i> customers such that the $Y starts going down via word of mouth or other coverage.<p><i>Stack rank your feature set in 'lifeboat' order, explain how you got that order.</i><p>You should have more features imagined or lined up than you can deliver, that gives you follow on. But you also need to know what is the minimum set for a viable product. Understanding how you get to that minimum set says a lot about your priorities, your sense of the customer, and your reasoning about the business.",1303498921

5767439,comment,5767290,5767290,7,0,Cieplak,,,"Are there any video chat clients with end-to-end encryption?<p>I was trying to do this by piping the output of my webcam to openssl and then to netcat, which sends the packets to a publicly addressable server (Amazon instance) that relays the encrypted packets to another computer behind a firewall, that decrypts the video stream and plays it in MPlayer.  It works, but the latency is about 10 seconds.  To reduce the latency, I could delta-encode the video stream, leverage the GPU somehow, but I'm not sure how to get the latency down to the 200ms required for seamless conversation.  Also, it should be noted that there is little code behind this, mainly just unix utilities and pipes.<p>PS: Also I could remove the Amazon piece and forge a direct P2P connection using NAT hole punching if the routers on both ends permit, but this is not always reliable and isn't a huge source of latency.",1369493894

5767434,comment,5767152,5767152,1,0,josephpmay,,,"This makes a number of assumptions that I think (based on historical trends) will end up proving false.<p>The first is that the services we use today (Yelp, Facebook, Google, etc.) will continue to be the dominate services of the future. Of course, the author probably just used these names for convenience instead of inventing new companies, but I have a feeling that the apps and services we'll be using 10 years from now don't exist today.<p>A more pressing false assumption is that all of these services (or whatever services are being used) will harmoniously work together. Though we have pretty strong inter-service collaboration currently (such Yelp telling us which restaurants our Facebook friends like), it is not that often that these platform relationships exist and even less common that everyone will be using the same interconnected services.<p>Finally, the assumption that is both the most necessary for this reality to be our future yet is also the most dubious is that with the dawn of quantum computing, algorithms will be able to properly interpret and predict human behavior. Thus far, algorithms fail pretty miserably at this (when was the last time you actually wanted to buy something suggested to you by Amazon?) and although the future resources available will have the capacity to interpret human behavior, it will be much farther in the future before we really will be able to utilize these available resources.<p>I still believe that always-on wearable computers with a constant information stream is where the consumer technology industry is heading (I've been saying this for years, and I don't necessarily think that Google will be the ones to perfect this formula). However, before we reach a society like the one predicted by this article, we (as computer scientists and mathematicians) need to become much better at interpreting and predicting human behavior. I think the first step in this is to understand how the brain works, which is probably going to be the most exciting facit of biomedical research in the coming decades.",1369493806

I couldn't see the quoted comment on the opening page, which is probably lucky, because it annoys me more than simply giving the prices in picodollars/byte. (Pricing it like that at least reveals that the pricing is actually per byte, rather than being, say, $0.30/GByte with some kind of rounding.)<p>More generally, I've always found it to be a good idea to be at least somewhat circumspect if you're going to have some kind of an asocial relationship with somebody (e.g., getting them to give you money). It's impossible to foretell what people will get annoyed by, so you might as well give them as few things to get annoyed by as possible.

5767424,comment,5766798,5766798,13,0,georgespencer,,,"So wide of the mark that I almost feel faint. Selected highlights:<p>> This cult is insidious. Its two main tenant are: 1. The designer is always right. 2. If you dont like what the designer is doing, youre wrong, and you should go somewhere else. Doesnt sound very friendly, does it?<p>1. Couple of fallacies here: you've set up a scenario in which your conclusion is supported (gosh, that doesn't sound friendly! This guy's a genius!), but it's also ignoratio elenchi: it doesn't fucking matter whether it's friendly or not, because who gives a shit whether the philosophy by which you design a product is friendly or not? It's like asking whether the philosophy is crunchy or gooey.<p>2. I would argue that if the designer is doing their job properly and working with and for users, then they will be usually right, and if you don't like it, you're wrong, and you should go somewhere else (because you're probably a neckbearded engineer trying to design something with zero user empathy).<p>> Steve Jobs made a zillion bucks cramming his design decisions down peoples throats.<p>1. In the same way as any designer, living or dead, who has shipped something to consumers, was ""cramming [their] design decisions down peoples' throats.""<p>2. In addition to the hugely biased language used, it's a gross oversimplification of design at Apple. A good example of Steve Jobs designing something is the iDVD anecdote. The iDVD team spend weeks working on a user interface that they think works. Jobs comes into the meeting, stops them halfway through, ignores their complicated workflows, and draws a simple rectangle which has a single ""BURN"" button on it. His great skill wasn't design, but editing and empathy.<p>> and now one of its founders spends his days custom-building and racing F1 cars.<p>Just another casual misrepresentation. DHH has not retired and is still working hard at 37signals.<p>> They did all this by being design dictators.<p>Yes. Forget the brilliant engineering, marketing, thought leadership, branding, etc. It was this cult thing you've conjured out of nowhere.<p>> Steve Jobs had a vision, and if you didnt like his vision, you could go home.<p>Yes. But a vision is nothing to do with design. Example: Steve Jobs had the vision for MobileMe/iCloud. The vision was a cloud-based software product that allowed you to synchronise your devices and keep data across all of them. The design is terrible. Design being architecture and the implementation. Vision != design.<p>And what do you mean by ""go home""? Isn't the same true of any product? If you don't like Android you can ""go home"". If you don't like Ferrari you can ""go home"". With ""go home"" you're implying that the consumer loses out. In reality because there IS ONLY ONE WAY A PRODUCT CAN POSSIBLY WORK, you're criticising them for not disrupting the space time continuum in order to offer two different products so you can not like Steve Jobs' vision and still like Steve Jobs' vision. Fuck me.<p>> 37 Signals made its products like it wanted to, and if you didnt like it, you could suck it.<p>WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? I'm giving up on the rest.",1369493688

Newspapers are a good example.  There's an editor who's in charge and they're in charge of the tone, direction and disposition of the sorts of things the paper is going to cover.  They may even write for their own paper, but the sum of the paper is always going to be more than just what they've directly put in.<p>Nevertheless, it's really important that the editor sets priorities for the newsroom, and manages what everyone is aiming at.<p>Are there bad newspaper editors?  Hell yes.  Are there strategies to circumvent bad editors?  Yes again.  Is it sometimes easier just to find another job than deal with an editors bullshit?

Didn't seem to hurt the iPhone's sales, though.<p>In that vein, i'm still entirely unsure as to whether Gnome is doing the wrong thing (particularly because i haven't seen anyone actually articulate what's wrong w/ Gnome3 in a meaningful way, and i have no idea who Gnome3's current actual userbase is, and who their intended userbase is).<p>What's the alternative?  Well, there's a couple.  Someone should articulate a reasonable case to the Gnome guys as to why their vision is wrong.  If that doesn't work, fork the project and let the userbase decide on where the project should go.<p>If you decide you don't like centralized authority in creative endeavors, i guess you can try to invent some new method of project direction (or heck borrow Debian's i guess), but all of these endeavors have their tradeoffs.  Debian moves slow, community forking is divisive, and trying to articulate why you are right and the Gnome guys are wrong is potentially futile.<p>-------------------------------------------------<p>I guess the tl;dr is this.  Design and (organizational) politics are interlinked, but they're not the same thing.  You can be good at design and bad at politics.  You can be good at politics and bad at design.

5767345,comment,5766191,5766191,4,0,graycat,,,"Sorry, guys.  After advanced study of probability,
writing a Ph.D. dissertation in applied probability,
and doing applications of probability in US national
security and business, here's my take on the OP:<p>(1) Sure, given a random variable taking values
in the real numbers, it has a (cumulative)
distribution and may have a probability density
distribution.<p>(2) In some special, fortunate cases, 
actually can get some useful
information about the distribution, e.g., it has
an expectation, the expectation is finite, it has a finite variance, and might
even be able to say that the distribution is in one
of the famous families, Gaussian, exponential,
Poisson, etc. and, then, estimate the parameters
of the distribution, e.g., for a Gaussian, estimate
the mean and variance.<p>(3) While we know that our random variable has
a distribution, mostly in practice we can't know
much about that distribution.  Commonly if we
know that the distribution has an expectation,
that the expectation is finite, and that
the variance is finite (that commonly we get
just by what we know about the real problem
with no effort in probability or statistics),
then we have to be satisfied with those
'qualitative' facts and
move on.  E.g., finite variance is enough
about the distribution
to apply the strong law of large numbers!<p>(4) Mostly when we do know that the distribution
is Gaussian, exponential, etc., it is because
we are using one of the classic limit theorems
of probability, e.g., the central limit theorem
or the renewal theorem.<p>(5) If the random variable takes values in,
for some positive integer n, some n-dimensional
space over, say, the real or complex numbers, then
in practice knowing much detail about the
distribution is next to hopeless.  Why?  Because
of the 'curse of dimensionality' where the
number of points needed for a fine grid
is commonly so high it makes 'big data'
look like something on a 3 x 5 index card!<p>Net, mostly we do our work in applied probability
knowing, of course, that a random variable has
a cumulative distribution but otherwise
knowing at most only some qualitative aspects, e.g.,
finite variance, and little else.<p>So, our more important methods of working with
random variables should need only meager assumptions
about the distributions of those random
variables.  E.g., order statistics are always
sufficient.  Commonly to get the most desired
estimates from least squares techniques,
need only finite mean and variance;
the common Gaussian assumptions about
the 'model error terms' is needed only
for doing classic confidence interval,
etc. estimates.<p>Generally there are a lot of 'non-parametric'
(distribution-free, where we make no
assumptions about the distribution)
techniques in hypothesis testing.  For estimation,
there are non-parametric techniques
based on, say, 'resampling' for getting
confidence intervals.  And there are other
distribution-free techniques.<p>Once I saw a paper in hypothesis testing
that was both multidimensional and
distribution-free.<p>Or, in shortest terms:  Yes, a random
variable always has a cumulative distribution,
but that doesn't mean that always in practice
we should try to find that distribution;
instead,
commonly in practice we have little
hope of knowing much about the distribution!<p>Or, one of the best books in probability
I know of is<p>Jacques Neveu,
'Mathematical Foundations of the Calculus of Probability',
Holden-Day.<p>and there is at most only meager mention
of specific distributions in the whole book!",1369491938

I think the OP, while relating this message to ""flat design"", is correct in his description of approaching design from the content outwards and only adding embellishments to the content-being-designed as needed to further enhance the clarity of understanding that content.<p>What I took away from this was that one should be careful with the visual elements one adds, and stop to think about how those additions are helping the primary goal of communicating ideas (this may take the form of reading words, feeling excited about a product, awareness of a brand, or usability of a UI).<p>I like his example of the screenshots framed by Apple devices (as I've seen on so many websites). Is the goal to communicate that you make Apple devices or that you make content that <i>could</i> work on that type of device? In this case I think (e.g., if this was for a business portfolio showing screenshots of software UIs to potential clients) the goal is more about showcasing <i>the work</i> not the devices; and the more minimalist ""flat design"" for those device frames would seem more appropriate in communicating the simple idea that ""our stuff works on mobile devices"".<p>I think many designers need to keep the OP's points in mind and consider, step by step, why what they're adding to the content in the form of design elements is helping rather than distracting. Do you really need a drop shadow on that image? Does it help make the content's point clearer to make your button look like it's made out of leather?

No amount of 4chan browsing will ever make you suddenly ""snap"" and decide that ""rape is cool"". If a picture with a ""witty"" caption on facebook is enough to make anyone change its mind, then we should worry about all harmful action, from aggression to murder, not just rape.<p>By the way, Q: what's worse than a baby in trashcan? A: A baby in two trashcans. Now does this joke encourages infanticide or is it just a piece of black humor that may or may not be to your liking (and will clearly hurt some people who lost a child, sorry if some are among HN readers)?<p>What's even more saddening about this debate is that YES, something NEEDS to be done and some people who may one day resort to rape or sexual aggression NEED to be educated. Instead people are still losing time here, fighting with people who are just doing these jokes ""for the lulz"" and would never resort to rape.

This is fine of course for many services, but data backup is inherently as mission critical as it gets. The whole reason for it is reliability, assurance and redundancy. It is not a nice to have, it is for many people the only place they fully trust to keep their data forever.<p>I wish Tarsnap had an innovation that made it possible to use it with one's (or an organization's) own AWS credentials.

For instance, a string is (in every case I've seen) a monoid, you can append to either end and there exists an ""empty"" string which turns appending into an identity.<p>For (e) this may not be true if we want to treat the string as semantically equivalent to whatever its representing---you cannot always arbitrarily append represented objects. That said, a string is <i>not</i> that represented object unless there's an isomorphism. In Haskell types, you'd want to have a `String -> Maybe a` function to capture failure-to-translate. This case includes things like `SQLSanitize`. Also HTML header <i>parsing</i> whenever the headers have an interpretation in the current level of the system.<p>Note also that this value of (e) does not depend upon a representation of strings as any kind of character-based thing. You can make a monoidal representation of a regular expression from a star-semiring combinator set (and see <a href=""http://r6.ca/blog/20110808T035622Z.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://r6.ca/blog/20110808T035622Z.html</a> for a great example).<p>The remaining semantic troubles seem to be around ideas of mapping or folding over a string. Length depends on this representation---do I want character length or byte length?---as do functions like `toUppercase`. And then there's the entire encoding/byte-representation business.<p>So they should perhaps be instances of an abstract class of ""Monoid"" plus a mixin specializing the kind of ""character"" representation. Or, the outside-in method of Haskell's typeclasses where String, ByteString(.Char8), and Text each specialize to a different use case but all instantiate `Monoid` and each have some kind of `mapping` and `folding` function which specialize to the kind of ""character"" intended. Finally, there are partial morphisms between each of them which fail when character encoding does.",1369491094

But what was important about what DHH did was define a vision and aesthetic for what web development should look like (and please note i'm no DHH fanboy.  I jumped ship during the Merb/Datamapper split), and kept on pushing on his priorities even in the face of legitimate criticisms of things he thought were less important.<p>So, Rails succeeded because DHH has sensible enough taste in terms of prioritizing concerns, and a strong enough user base to fix Rails's shortcomings.<p>I'm not as familiar with the specific battles over Gnome (partially because i'm on OSX, and also because i find the interlocutors in the Gnome discussion to be so furiously inarticulate), but the conflict really only comes down to two possibilities.  Either the leaders of Gnome genuinely are shit designers and aren't meeting the needs of their community, or they're really terrible at politics.<p>That's a really important distinction to be mindful of.  I'm not amongst their target userbase, so frankly I can't say one way or the other, but all of the complaints I've heard against Gnome's leadership are things that I as a user have never ever cared about (granted I haven't used Gnome in a while, but all the times i've used systems w/ Gnome installed by default in the past, i've been satisfied).<p>And really, if Gnome's leadership is so inadequate, i'm puzzled why a critical mass hasn't risen up and forked the community.

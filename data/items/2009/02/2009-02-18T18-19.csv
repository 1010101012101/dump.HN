2) If Google uses it’s dominance in search market to shut out competition in other market.",1234983579

The article mentions some cities that are key to their regions.  The book breaks up North America into nine regions with economic and cultural connections, and names a ""capital"" city for each of them.  For example, Miami as the ""capital"" of a region including the Carribean.

At some point you have to make a break from the comfort of being yourself in a networking environment, and implement a more robust marketing plan that involves PR, advertising, other sales people, etc.<p>2)  Networking itself has a limited (though sometimes highly targeted) audience.  This is perfect when you start, but limiting at the point you need to grow.<p>3)  Even if the goal is to remain a small consulting firm, automation of at least some aspects of lead generation and sales is necessary for efficiency.  For instance, putting a process in place to hit up your existing customers for leads.",1234981501

Our mission at Mahalo, since not everyone here has spent 20 minutes having coffee with me (yet) is the following: ""to help people find information they can trust.""<p>We are testing different ways of doing this including:<p>1. hand crafter search results with content
2. a knowledge exchange (Mahalo Answers)
3. how to articles 
4. (coming april 10th)
5. (coming September 15th)<p>The real goal of Mahalo is to build a service that combines the three most important services on the internet: content, search and knowledge exchange.<p>For an example of this look at our bob dylan page:

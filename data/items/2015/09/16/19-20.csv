Your calculation assumes that the computer uses a full 350+ watts of electricity. If it had a 350 watt PSU and was drawing that full load - it would shutdown (I&#x27;ve had this happen). Even then the CPU doesn&#x27;t require 350 watts of power [1]. The only device that I know of that will use and designed to use a full load is a bitcoin miner.<p>Taking in consideration that these computers might have been left on already. I would argue that he used MAYBE an extra 50 watts of electricity [2]. So assuming $0.10/kw/hr (which is the cost of where I live) - he wasted a whopping $0.12/day or ~$50/year.<p>You have to take into account if the computers were already on. He didn&#x27;t waste electricity because someone left their computer on - his &quot;waste&quot; would be electricity use that is above that of an &quot;idle computer&quot;. It should also be pointed out that if the computer has Mcafee or some other crappy AV the CPU usage would be 100% anyways due to poor programming of the AV software (I have personally seen this many times and you don&#x27;t know how many times people complain about their slow computer because the AV is using 100% of the CPU).<p>There is no way he wasted $7m - and even if he did and no one noticed that is part of a larger problem. Besides they only claim he wasted $1.2m - $1.6m [3] - with no evidence of how they came up with that number. That is saying he managed to waste over $100k/year (over 9 years) in equipment purchases, electricity etc - and NO ONE noticed this? I find it hard to believe that the people managing the budget were like &quot;$100k unaccounted for this year? no big deal...&quot;. And even if it was accounted for and signed off - there should be 2 people fired - his and the guy who approved the purchase.<p>Even from the article:<p>> would find that in a middle of a lesson, the SMART Board had turned off.<p>This has happened to me personally on my own laptop.

This basically implements an Inner Platform Effect of an internal data-based language for concurrency that the language interprets, which will A: forever be weaker than the exterior language (such is the nature of the Inner Platform Effect) and B: require a lot of work that is essentially duplicating program control flow and all sorts of other things the exterior language already has.<p>There are some programming languages that have sufficiently impoverished semantics that this is their best effort that they can make towards concurrency.<p>But this is <i>Rust</i>.

However, I expect will almost certainly lead to decreased education funding from other revenue sources, and ultimately place education footing on less solid ground for years to come.<p>It was brilliant PR move to earmark the tax revenue for education, there&#x27;s no doubt about that. It&#x27;s very hard to argue with such things, and many other states have opted to dedicate certain &quot;sin taxes&quot; to select public works. For example, earmarking some funds for veterans affairs out of state lottery tickets as my state (Iowa) does, or education as many more states do.<p>On the surface, this seems like a brilliant way to justify revenue collection for what many citizens would consider unseemly or undignified. It is an effective sales pitch to say to a voter, &quot;You may disagree with marijuana legalization, but it will bring in $50 million dollars to state schools.&quot;<p>The problem is that budgets will adjust to incorporate this earmark for future years. That is, education budgets are likely to reflect this revenue for future years. That&#x27;s precisely what has happened in so many states where state lottery revenues have been earmarked for education and other noble causes. John Oliver&#x27;s Last Week Tonight had an excellent take on a similar topic: the &quot;sin tax&quot; of state lottery tickets.

However, rather than fixing this problem, policymakers are again turning to ultra-easy monetary policy in the form of QE. Viewed from this perspective, QE can be interpreted as a form of asset market trickledown whereby supporting asset prices is supposed to jumpstart the macro economy…From a political standpoint, this is an enormous change from the world of forty years ago. The New Deal policy paradigm of wage floors and household income supports has been replaced by one of asset price floors and asset market subsidies. Viewed through a political lens QE therefore represents the triumph of plutonomics, and that makes it an obstruction to the extent it obscures the challenge of repairing the income and demand generation process.</i><p>The Fed has dug itself into a hole with QE, where it is losing the ability to control anything in the economy due to the lower 0 bound of the FFR and the economy&#x27;s inability to handle an interest rate hike.<p>It is up to the Federal Government (which, democratically speaking, means we the people) to adopt New Deal-like investments in infrastructure, R&D, education, and tech to seed long-term prosperity in order to rebuild an economy with a strong middle class that will demand loans for things like mortgages, appliances, cars, and machinery, as well as drive invention and wealth creation rather than rent-seeking & arbitrage as we are seeing today.<p>[1] <a href=""https://ideas.repec.org/p/uma/periwp/wp252.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://ideas.repec.org/p/uma/periwp/wp252.html</a>",1442432611

Normally software is applied to video footage to detect different events such as motion or sound.<p>Butterfleye automates that process and simply video logs all activity and presents it in a newsfeed on the application on your smartphone.<p>By applying ABR or Activity Based Recording Butterfleye saves resources like energy, storage, and bandwidth as it does not require to be fully turned on and recording at all times like traditional security and or monitoring cameras.<p>More importantly it only records events so you do not have to sift through hours of footage to find the few seconds you care about.<p>Some people compare the Butterfleye camera with other IP cameras and CCTV on the market because it does the same thing, but really it is more about how it does it and why it does it that way.<p>We wanted to provide a better user experience for those who are interested in video monitoring. What do you all think of the technology behind our product?<p>Thanks",1442431615

You&#x27;re white in SV? you must be doing great, move along we&#x27;re not looking to help you) -- As others have stated, it&#x27;s also partly because of the specified groups.<p>B) If the ground really is that uneven maybe the problem is not the founders, but the system (again, how to change that is a super complicated discussion)<p>I feel like a more tactful way to put out such a call for people who would like help might be something like:<p>&quot;YC is putting on a special series of office hours for struggling startups. In past series we&#x27;ve found that certain groups of people were underrepresented, and we&#x27;d like for that not to be the case, so we are going to prioritize the following groups: <group listing here>. This doesn&#x27;t mean anyone who is not in those groups is unwelcome.&quot;<p>As others have noted, getting away from the group listing would be even better. Maybe just making a call for anyone who feels like they have been &quot;marginalized&quot; in the SV startup community, or aren&#x27;t receiving enough help might suffice (without making a laundry list of underrepresented people).<p>I have many opinions on the whole &quot;diversity&quot; debate, but I think my most defensible opinion is for organizations to aim for population-parity demographic distributions, and work to upset any limiting functions that might be skewing your sector away from the wider population&#x27;s distributions (again, how to do this is highly debated, and I have a ton of my own opinions on the subject, but I digress).<p>I&#x27;ve also intentionally left out my own race/cultural group/whatever in this comment, but make sure to check your own biases at the door - I could be caucasian, latino, african american, asian, lgbt, trans, whatever .",1442431239

I learned about the 10% reserve ratio in macroeconomics class, where I also learned that there&#x27;s this thing called the money multiplier.  See, if banks are required to hold a fraction r (10%) of their deposits in reserve, then obviously they&#x27;ll lend out the rest, which will in turn be held or spent by the borrower, and one way or another it&#x27;ll end up back in a bank.  So a (1-r) fraction of the actual cash and Fed-issued money ends up lent out and redeposited.  But the banks can loan out a (1-r) fraction of /that/, ad infinitum.  So the total amount of deposited money is 1 + (1-r) + (1-r)^2 + ... = 1/r of whatever money (cash and things actually deposited at the Fed) the Fed created in the first place.  Since r = 10%, the multiplier is 10.<p>The official page AFAICT is here:<p><a href=""http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/reservereq.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/reservereq.htm</a><p>The effective ratio is actually under 10% these days.<p>Edit: Fixed an inconsequential typo.",1442430616

Unfortunately poverty doesn&#x27;t have a strong, dedicated representative in these upper class circles, because only a tiny number of people born poor ever make it into the media or valley cocktail parties. Black, Hispanic, Women, Veterans - all have members both in needy classes and in upper classes to champion their own cause. But using this represented-in-the-bubble approach results in an arbitrary mix of random criteria that only half serves the purpose. There are certainly many Black/Hispanic/Women/Veterans in need and deserving of help, but there&#x27;s also plenty who are trust fund babies who don&#x27;t need it. Meanwhile, there are a lot of obvious groups left out of this list - Native Americans, poor Appalachian whites, etc. It seems ridiculous to explicitly help Blacks and Hispanics, but not Native Americans.

Let&#x27;s consider the case of one api endpoint being  changed by one developer, to add a new param to a function call. Further assume that this impacts hundreds of projects.<p>Does it really make sense to make one developer update those hundred projects? Not only will it take forever for it to get finished (possibly never if there are new consumers of this api coming online frequently), but the developer of the core api may not have any experience in the impacted consumers of this codebase. I think the end result of this policy would be nothing once written <i>ever</i> would get updated, and new apis would just be added all the time (api explosion).",1442430363

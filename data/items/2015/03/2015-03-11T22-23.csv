9188040,comment,9186362,9188007,0,0,logn,,,"Ultrasound is not without risk. The general advice is to follow the ALARA principle (as low exposure as reasonably achievable). In the early 90&#x27;s the FDA under pressure from manufacturers approved a 7-fold increase in the power output of ultrasound. Part of that approval was that ultrasound machines show feedback to technicians on estimated amount of tissue heating. That&#x27;s one of the main concerns. E.g., in a fetus, heating tissue above 4 degrees or so causes damage and that level of heating is possible, especially around areas of bone.<p>Good presentation:  <a href=""http://radiology.ucsd.edu/body_image/pdfs/visitors/bohazards_of_us_rsna08_pretorius2.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://radiology.ucsd.edu/body_image/pdfs/visitors/bohazards...</a>",1426114722

I can&#x27;t avoid it when I don&#x27;t want to resize and can&#x27;t make it work when I do want to resize. I didn&#x27;t love the old &quot;+|-&quot; UI elements in the old Android (way back in the ~1.3 days, I guess), but I didn&#x27;t <i>hate</i> them, the way I rage about random resizing. And, it&#x27;s universal, too. It&#x27;s not a thing that is unique to Android, or iOS or Windows, or Linux; I have these problems no matter what OS I&#x27;m using. Multitouch interfaces are <i>really difficult</i> for me to use.<p>My mom has an iPad, and she has a hard time with this kind of stuff, too. But, then again, the mouse was also hard for her...she managed to almost entirely miss the desktop/laptop computer age, by leaving my dad in charge of all computer-oriented activity, but now that he&#x27;s gone, she has had to learn.<p>Anyway, it&#x27;s clear that most technology is designed by and for able-bodied people in their 20s and 30s. Everybody else just kinda has to figure out workarounds (my dad used to have the resolution on his display set really low in Windows, so that everything would be big, so he could read it...there are ways to make Windows use large fonts and such, but not all software respects those settings, so he found the most universally consistent way to get big fonts was to work at a very low resolution).",1426114366

9188011,comment,9178765,9183531,0,0,BrendanEich,,,"First, you missed my point, which was clear enough from the context you cut: stagnation would have been a problem for any hypothetical Python circa version 1.3, wedged into Netscape Navigator (other problems listed below). It would have been flash-frozen in 1995, not just due to standardization or Netscape losing the first browser war, simply due to the Web&#x27;s scale.<p>Python (like Lua, Perl, etc.) had to evolve backward-incompatibly, and thankfully could do so as a Unix-y and server-side command line. As a browser-embedded scripting engine, don&#x27;t-break-the-web selection pressure would have forked and stunted early Python or any other language about as badly as JS, ignoring the spurious (to what I wrote) &quot;Blub was a better language to start from&quot; benefit. That&#x27;s the main point.<p>Python was never an option, anyway, as I&#x27;ve remarked in many places. Netscape management insisted on &quot;make it look like Java&quot;, and time pressure combined with &quot;don&#x27;t be too big a sidekick&quot; angst from Sun kept such things as classes out of JS in the early days (it took till ES6 to add classes). Python had OS-specific APIs and an unsafe FFI to boot, so would have been forked by stripping out many features, too. Fuzz testing would have exacted further costs, but I&#x27;ll stop here. Python was never an option in the &#x27;90s, for many reasons.<p>BTW, I did help manage and fund Mark Hammond (then at Active State), when I was leading Mozilla in the early noughties, to add C-Python as an alternative scripting language engine to Gecko. That code was for Active State&#x27;s Komodo IDE, which used Python in XUL script elements. But the DOM complexity tax was bad enough that Gecko maintainers ripped it all out just a couple of years ago. See<p><a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?order=Importance&resolution=---&resolution=FIXED&resolution=INVALID&resolution=WONTFIX&resolution=DUPLICATE&resolution=WORKSFORME&resolution=INCOMPLETE&resolution=SUPPORT&resolution=EXPIRED&classification=Client%20Software&query_format=advanced&component=PyXPCOM&product=Other%20Applications"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?order=Importance&re...</a><p>So I know a lot more about what you&#x27;re blithely talking about, from actual experience, than you do.<p>Finally, your hyperbolic language (&quot;tragedy&quot;) is off target. Mozilla is way underfunded compared to all of the other browser vendors. It could and still can least afford to jam in other languages, plus pay the requisite inter-heap cycle collector and write-barrier overhead costs you neglect to mention. Falling on this sword would have done nothing -- did nothing even with Mark Hammond&#x27;s fine work -- to displace JS or get other browsers on board. It would have helped Mozilla fail, though.<p>You&#x27;d do better to cry that Google did not fund, out of its massive profit margins and market cap, engineers to add such things to other open source engines -- as Microsoft has done with Pointer Events for Gecko and WebKit.<p>Please do name a standard that Mozilla supports which is both (a) more complex than multiple language runtimes embedded and integrated with a low-overhead-enough inter-heap cycle collector; and (b) not already obligatory for competitive browsers to support (as Dart certainly is not!). Take your time; list your references.<p>Apple and Microsoft won&#x27;t fund such follies, and even Google has yet to ship Dart on top of Oilpan in Chrome (<a href=""https://www.chromestatus.com/features/6682831673622528"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.chromestatus.com/features/6682831673622528</a>).<p>This is not a case of me as past Mozilla leader ducking &quot;responsibility&quot; to fund your pet follies based on breathtakingly incomplete HN-comment assertions about low complexity from you. I don&#x27;t owe you or anyone that big a free lunch. (How about you write the patch and submit it, with tests, and then talk to Mozilla or any other open source browser project.)<p>Rather, it&#x27;s a set of three confirming signals showing that while talk is cheap, multiple independent language engines in one browser certainly are not. Only Google has the funds and engineers to burn on such speculative work. And it&#x27;s an open question whether Chrome has the market power to make any such extension &quot;stick&quot; as a de-facto standard.",1426114365

Not true if you go to small-claims court: it will be investigated even if only 1 screw-up occur. Yes going to small-claims court is more work than filing a credit card dispute, but then if it is not worth your time given the transaction amount, it kind of proves that being refunded isn&#x27;t THAT important to you. In this case you would complain to the FTC, and write off the small amount lost.<p>> You dismiss completely the possibility that this is because of the existence of chargebacks?<p>I acknowledge chargebacks incentivize merchants to act honestly. But I will repeat for the third time: this is not the only thing that incentivize merchants. FTC, BBB, legal actions, etc.<p>> Google tiger direct bitcoin refund<p>I did and I found 2 stories, both resolved in favor of the customer:<p>- &quot;Edit: The situation is resolved&quot; from <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1wesnv/beware_of_tigerdirect_bitcoin_payments/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1wesnv/beware_of_ti...</a><p>- &quot;He personally verified my address again for the shipment as well as a &quot;care package&quot;&quot; from <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1wi95l/another_tiger_direct_bitcoin_horror_story/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1wi95l/another_tige...</a><p>This proves my point that most merchants act honestly and that most disputes get resolved without chargebacks :)<p>> having the funds available again in a few minutes<p>No. When credit card issuers refund you instantly, it is always a TEMPORARY refund (check the fine print of your credit card agreement) - you still need to submit a full package usually within 60 days with evidence of the dispute (tracking numbers, product descriptions, pictures of what was received, etc) for the credit card issuer to investigate and either make the refund permanent, or resolve in favor of the merchant. That&#x27;s why I keep explaining t you that submitting this evidence of the dispute is similar in complexity to submitting a complaint to the FTC as they ask the same things a credit card issuer would ask.<p>Out of curiosity: how many credit card disputes have you ever filed?

Thus, the coder presses &quot;Save&quot; (or perhaps &quot;Commit&quot;, if &quot;Save&quot; is not atomic enough for deployment) and then either the CI system pushes out files or deploys for you or Orion pokes the development server to grab the latest files.<p>I am 100% positive it will take some mental and maybe even logistical reorganization to switch to a cloud-based coding environment.

This is how success breeds success; good fortune optimizes for more of the same.<p>Conversely, if you&#x27;re doing badly and feeling desperate, you&#x27;re more likely to take the riskier bet, which is naturally the one more likely to fail.

The fact that it turns out that &quot;now&quot; is one hellishly leaky abstraction. My perspective coming from biology is that for many systems the only meaningful type of &quot;clock&quot; is a logical clock. The important thing is not &quot;when,&quot; when is used as a proxy for an assumed state of a remote part of the system (even if remote is only 10cm away), logical clocks are the only source that can guarantee that the state of the system is what you expect it to be so that it will perform as expected. Thanks to the many hardware guys who have spent years working out the underlying logic for this we mostly ignore it for things like processors. Now we just need to solve it for arbitrarily large finite delays!

Do you force birth control on people who do not meet a certain level of financial independence? Do you take kids away from parents who lose that financial independence? Do you let people starve and freeze to death?<p>There is a mythos that everybody can just create and run their own startup, and the world can be fed on startups of O(1) size. I don&#x27;t believe it (though I believe it can go a long way towards solving the problem), and, even if I did, startups still fail and people still need food, housing and warmth.<p>Governments don&#x27;t have to take money from anyone to make this happen. They can just print it. Of course it amounts to the same thing, but everybody&#x27;s money is dependent on the underlying financial system that is backed by governments (crypto-currencies are, <i>slowly</i>, making this less true).<p>I wonder how it would turn out if there was a single fund created to provide this living arrangement. Everybody is allowed to donate whatever they want to it (with no benefit other than knowing that they donated), then, any shortfall is met by printing the money, devaluing the currency in use equally for all.<p>I don&#x27;t know that it&#x27;s a good idea; it should be tested first, and, if it fails, we throw it out (unlike so many &quot;big&quot; ideas where, if and when it fails, the reason is always that &quot;we didn&#x27;t do it <i>big</i> enough, so we have to throw more at it&quot;). The success criteria need to be well defined, but not politically motivated like so many ideas for providing for the poor. Like I said, I don&#x27;t know how to get there from here.<p><i>My issue still is that these costs will only increase over time.</i><p>My argument is predicated on the idea that the cost of living will steadily decrease over time. If the cost of shipping approaches zero because everything can be JIT manufactured locally and the social interaction values of living in a city dwindle due to continually improved online interaction, the cost of living becomes food and shelter which don&#x27;t need to be centralized in expensive cities.<p>Localized JIT manufacturing is going to massively upset the global economy. I don&#x27;t see a way out short of massive government efforts to prevent technological progress (which I expect to see), but technology will march forward anyway. Is it better to move towards a new economic model that accounts for it or just deal with the revolution when 75% of people are unemployed?<p>The biggest risk factor, IMO, is cost of energy. We need it to be going down significantly, because it will take cheap energy to drive the JIT manufacturing that enables a very inexpensive minimum cost of living. I really do think we are in a race between a social collapse due to unemployment, hunger, and social disparity and copious free energy. And I think social collapse is currently winning, so if we could hold that off for a bit, both through reducing social unease and increasing funding in energy research, I&#x27;d really be OK with that.<p><i>The single worst thing you can do for someone disadvantaged is to give them a reason to stay exactly where they are in life (and no incentive to succeed at something more). A basic income does exactly this.</i><p>No, the single worst thing you can do is let them starve or freeze to death, because then their one and only life is over. And that literally happens to poor people. I consider this argument the &quot;the poor are only poor because they are lazy, so anything that makes them more lazy will only make them worse&quot; argument. And I believe it is a lazy argument in itself.<p>I&#x27;ve scrounged through cupboards hoping there was <i>anything</i> in them while my parents drank away whatever money they got. I <i>get</i> the potential negatives better than most people around here. But I also know that there are a lot of people who were just not fortunate to be born in the right place to the right parents with the right opportunities right in front of them.<p>I went to school and to college, paid for by the tax payer mostly, because I worked hard (actually, most people in the US went to college mostly paid for by the tax payer, regardless of how hard they worked).

(Otherwise, you&#x27;re stuck with OS X, Windows, or the Windows utility on WINE, though there are some okay open-source config utils).<p>- It&#x27;s going to be pretty much rock solid. They&#x27;re very good about reacquiring network access, and the firmware is about the cleanest I&#x27;ve ever seen on a router from a technical perspective (the iCloud services are a bit weird, but those are optional).<p>- You really only need one of them to serve single-level homes /apartments where they&#x27;ll be punching through less than 5-6 walls.<p>- It <i>won&#x27;t</i> auto-update, but some might consider this a feature.<p>- If you plug a second AirPort in, it asks if you want to extend the first network.<p>That aside, the bandwidth reduction from a multihop mesh would likely make the Eero unsuitable for my needs (I tend to saturate AC, so I just throw more wired access points at the coverage problem to keep my bandwidth up).",1422985909

English is full of examples where incorrect usage became pervasive enough to become accepted as correct. But some people fight that process because they don&#x27;t like that the language changes as a result of people using it ignorantly.<p>For me, it really comes down to how you view the purpose of language. If the purpose is to convey meaning as accurately as possible, then these changes devalue the language since the usages that result from ignorant speakers are, by nature, less precise. The oft-cited &quot;begging the question&quot; has a very precise meaning that&#x27;s difficult to convey in other terms. When ignorant usage widens the meaning, we lose the ability to easily refer to the more narrow meaning.<p>On the other hand, you can view language as a shared cultural identity that&#x27;s always shifting and evolving organically. In that light, these minutiae are pointless because the majority of speakers don&#x27;t understand the subtlety and never will. You can try to educate people, but you&#x27;ll just end up alienating them. As humans, we&#x27;re evolved to learn language from our environment and the people who talk to us, not from a textbook.

Because I&#x27;m not good at exploring my thoughts purely objectively. I&#x27;m human. When I use a tool, I feel passion. Sometimes positive, sometimes negative. When I use Lisp, it burns like fire. But when I try to explain it, I have to admit: there are only downsides the eye can see.<p>When I use PHP, vb.net, or MongoDB, I&#x27;m on Antartica. Without a jacket. It&#x27;s cold. It&#x27;s sad. There are no penguins. I feel bad. But I cannot tell you why. I have to admit: they get the job done. Millions use them. The greatest of the greatest sites and applications are built with them. Software that you use every day. Around the world.<p>So perhaps it&#x27;s just me. As painful as it is to admit, I simply cannot find the words to match my feelings about this.

Unless your walls are filled with water or contain a tuned copper mesh, you should probably just spend more on your main router, make sure to use 5GHz, and run wires if that doesn&#x27;t work. Unlike 2.4GHz with 1-3 non-overlapping channels available (depending on your chosen bandwidth), the 5GHz band has 21 non-overlapping channels.<p>You&#x27;re pretty much guaranteed to be fighting with several neighboring wifi networks in an apartment (and you&#x27;re more likely to get the hidden node problem), so that&#x27;s pretty much worst case for 2.4GHz.<p>If you have a legacy requirement for 2.4GHz, try a single ASUS RT-N66U before installing two routers. I&#x27;ve seen it effortlessly cover several-thousand-square-foot areas from the back room or basement. I was able to get reasonable signal from one in a lobby through four vertical floors (and through many other active wireless networks).<p>If you want AC / have AC-capable devices: get an AirPort Extreme if you use Apple hardware, or any of the ASUS AC (like the AC66U) routers otherwise. Be forewarned: many AC routers on the market <i>combine</i> their maximum 5GHz N speed and 5GHz AC speed for their &quot;total capable speed&quot;, for example &quot;N600 + AC1800 = AC2400!&quot; [1] (it is a very nice router, but you&#x27;re just about as well off in an apartment with an AC66U). Also, if you get an ASUS router, make sure to replace the default firmware with Tomato Shibby or asuswrt-rmerlin as the stock software has a bad habit of sprouting moderate to critical security vulns (ASUS isn&#x27;t special here. Many of the consumer router vendors have this problem.).<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.asus.com/us/News/hE5SJg3y7bbIBIGO"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.asus.com/us/News/hE5SJg3y7bbIBIGO</a>",1422984446

As an example, imagine an obviously wrong statement in the summary of Batman saying that his alter ego is Clark Kent (trying to remember the actual articles, this wasn&#x27;t one, but they were just as bad). This is clearly wrong and easily verifiable, but someone would revert the edits and dispute it in the talk pages. If an algorithm were incorrectly described on a CS page I would try to correct it, leaving comments in the discussion about why I was making changes. They were almost all reverted to incorrect pseudo-code or python implementations. Again, these were easily verifiable (in some cases by literally copy/pasting the python code and trying to run it).

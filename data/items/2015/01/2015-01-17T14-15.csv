AFAIK, if someone is crossing the street you must stop your vehicle (which seems obvious because if not, you&#x27;d run them over). This doesn&#x27;t mean that you can just cross the street wherever and whenever you may please, neither does it mean that you can actually walk in the street.

Really, it revolved around what the implications were if one neglected the core such that it was a valid premise. How would you torture a model of the earth to allow a person to compensate for not bothering to keep track of the core in a model? Gravity is the most obvious start, which you can get away with some perverse shell geometries (which has the added benefit of ruining the shape of the planet). And there&#x27;s all manner of heat and magnetics (I think we largely assumed those were also neglectable, which in retrospect is poor planning due to solar wind).<p>It wandered like that. It was a direct result of our introduction to modeling in the early core engineering courses. Wherein we abuse the power of deciding what gets into the model.

Either<p>A. the barrier to entry for other languages is too high (Javascript for the browser, Objective-C and Swift for iOS, etc), and so there is no evidence that there is anything good about it (you just lump it and accept that&#x27;s the way things are done).<p>or<p>B. Because it is still a generic, C-style, imperative, possibly somewhat OO language that feels very similar to a language you already know, and which is a reasonable choice for nearly any problem (rather than ideally suited to a subset of problems), and you are probably selecting it based on that merit rather than any real technical merit the language offers. (Note that this can be a reasonable business decision, but oftentimes people delude themselves. &quot;We use the best tool for the job&quot;...so long as that tool is Java or Javascript)<p>As you say, all imperative and OOP languages are fundamentally the same; for me it&#x27;s when languages veer off that path that they start getting interesting and really differentiate themselves.<p>As a note, too, &#x27;there is no easier way to create a single GUI for 3 platforms, as JS&#x27; is not a testament to how good JS is, but a testament to Netscape being in the right place at the right time. It was a language written in a week, whose syntax was forced by suits to be &#x27;Java like&#x27; because that was what was popular at the time, and which had no competition.",1421504482

I had a few experiences like that in college.<p>I once got a bit depressed and skipped a lot of classes; when I finally dragged myself to a numerical methods class I was told that I might be unlikely to pass it at all given all my absence. For some reason this made me so interested in the topic itself that I spent ton of time learning and internalizing the concepts, aced all the assignments and in the end I put the PhD that taught our lab classes in a very awkward position - he wanted to give me the best possible mark but he couldn&#x27;t given my initial absence and the established rules (he actually did stick to the rules he set and gave me a reduced grade, for which I highly respected him and later choose him as my BSc advisor). Funnily, the momentum I gained actually transferred to other classes so I pretty much aced everything that year.<p>I had a lot of other situations of the kind of &quot;what do you mean this language doesn&#x27;t even have functions? I&#x27;ll hack it until it gains them.&quot; leading to the most crazy final project submitted; or &quot;what do you mean I can&#x27;t ace this class?

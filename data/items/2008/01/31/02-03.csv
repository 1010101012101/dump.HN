The value of the feedback by far exceeds the cost of having users look at a product that isn't flawless.<p>This is especially true for something as complicated as a programming language.",1201748036

Just as there is nothing wrong with eating an ice cream, in and of itself.<p>But if you get into the habit of eating ice cream all the time, if you start eating more and more ice cream to the point where you are neglecting normal food, you will end up with a nutrition imbalance which will result in decreased mental ability, decreased ability to concentrate for long periods of time, and oh yeah you will get fat, which most people consider to be a bad thing.",1201746828

107224,comment,107154,107154,0,0,Hexstream,,,"From reading this, I conclude that Lisp has MAJOR potential for developing big games in a quick and smart way. You'd develop and debug your game from within itself (REPL access in-game, restart support, etc), and then to ship it you'd make a compiler that compiles down to the proper runtime environment (C?) (so that you don't have to worry about lisp compatibility for the gamers and the garbage collector ruining the experience once in a while).<p>It's a major undertaking, but the potential payoff is HUGE!<p>DISCLAIMER: I don't know what I'm talking about (games development).",1201745884

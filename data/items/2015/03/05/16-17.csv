I grew up in the suburbs, more of a sheltered upbringing due to the makeup of the neighborhood.  For many years, when I&#x27;d be walking downtown, if I saw a group of people that looked like they were from a typical rap video (not specifically any race, but more the group&#x27;s clothing and body language, although race does play a part of it), I&#x27;d turn down another corner.  This is mostly due to what got fed to me by TV and other sources, and the knowledge that a nerdy white guy is probably the most hated vulnerable person in that area at that time.  Now I know that this is totally irrational, and it wasn&#x27;t until I forced myself to not turn a different corner each time, that I started to get over it.<p>Now on another level, I&#x27;m a very bashful person, so I have a hard time looking at people in the eyes when I talk to them.  Therefore my eyes are pointed at a 30 - 60 degree angle downward towards the floor.  And guess what is in that line of site if I happen to be talking to a woman at work?  So I learned to just stare straight ahead, or start messing with my phone, whenever a female coworker passes me in the hall.  Just to avoid giving the impression that I&#x27;m looking her up and down, due to my natural instinct to avoid eye contact by shifting my gaze downward towards the floor after seeing someone make eye contact with me (which, as mentioned, can be taken the wrong way, and land me in HR).",1425574095

The Court concludes that the  reduced rate of VAT is applicable to a transaction consisting of the supply of a book found on a physical medium. While admittedly, in order to be able to read an electronic book, physical support (such as a computer) is\nrequired, such support is not included in the supply of electronic books, meaning that Annex III does not include the supply of such books within its scope.\nMoreover, the Court finds that the VAT Directive excludes any possibility of a reduced VAT rate being applied to ‘electronically supplied services’. The Court holds that the supply of electronic books is such a service. The Court rejects the argument that the supply of electronic books constitutes a supply of goods (and not a supply of services).

Except... kids with high IQ <i>should</i> have good grades; so why does that first group have bad grades? Why are they weird like that? What&#x27;s going on? Do they have some sort of severe home problem? Emerging mental health issues? Systematic personality differences? You may well find that having &#x27;controlled for&#x27; IQ, the kids with bad grades are more likely to be jailed and conclude that schooling helps prevent crime... but what have you really found?<p>In this case, what the researchers have found is that twins are powerfully locked together in terms of health outcomes, body types, diets, and exercise tolerance/preference, so locked together that they have to scour millions of people to turn up a handful of twin pairs. These twin pairs are &#x27;matched&#x27; on genetics/upbringing (IQ), but not matched on exercise (grades), and so one gets health outcomes (jailing) &#x27;controlling for&#x27; genetics/upbringing... so one concludes exercise helps prevent worse health... but what have you really found?<p>(At least, I think this is what Paul Meehl was talking about in <a href=""http://www.mcps.umn.edu/assets/pdf/4.13_Meehl.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mcps.umn.edu/assets/pdf/4.13_Meehl.pdf</a> &quot;Nuisance Variables and the Ex Post Facto Design&quot;, 1969, in _Minnesota studies in the philosophy of science: Vol. IV.

9151835,comment,9150899,9151600,0,0,vonmoltke,,,"> I&#x27;m just starting to believe that the damage of so many false positives to avoid the occasional false negative may be harming the industry more than we realize.<p>I think you have &quot;false positive&quot; and &quot;false negative&quot; backwards, but I agree with your point.  I have long thought that the industry systematically understates the damage of false negatives and overstates the damage of false positives.<p>If you are hiring, it fits one of two broad categories: catch as catch can, or specific need.  In a catch as catch can situation, the &quot;always hiring&quot; mode, the company can afford to place more emphasis on minimizing the false positive rate at the expense of the false negative rate because the desire is to skim the cream off the top of the applicant pool as it comes to you.  The company doesn&#x27;t need new people per se; it finds slots for these highly-capable people somewhere in the company after the hire is made.<p>In the specific need situation, the company is hiring to fill a hole.  Either work is not getting done, or other people are overburdened with the responsibilities this new hire will take on.  In this case, every day that passes costs the company in some way.  The cost of a false negative is related to the quality and size of the applicant pipeline.  A false negative could add anywhere from a few days, if the company has a strong pipeline, to a few months, if the company has a weak pipeline, to the timeline for filling this position.  The &quot;false negatives are cheap&quot; position comes from the former, but I would say that very few companies actually have an applicant pipeline that strong.  Furthermore, if you can go months without filling a position and not suffer any ill effects, you need to ask yourself why you are looking for someone in the first place.",1425573683
9151834,comment,9151472,9151472,0,0,D-Train,,,"Great post highlighting what you learned from the AlterConf, as well as sharing some of those stories of the presenters. This resonates me in a couple ways, at least, immediately in my mind:<p>1. Dr. Cox&#x27;s story... My business school recently appointed a new dean who is a black woman. She&#x27;s the first dean of a Top 20 program, and one that created all sorts of ripples for her, the business school (and greater university), alumni, etc. Can&#x27;t say that Dr. Cox and the new Dean share similar stories, but there was much ado about her being a black woman. Perhaps that&#x27;s a good thing, though, when it comes to opening the door for openness later.<p>2. Being an Asian male, there are some annoying stereotypes. I was thinking about this the other day how I don&#x27;t feel there are powerful Asian male or female role models. Also, there&#x27;s this cultural norm for being a little &quot;quieter&quot;. When you bake all these ideas (and others) together, there seems to be a lack of &quot;power&quot; and respect given to Asian groups. So much so, that I feel it also creates associations and clubs that aren&#x27;t as vocal or &quot;extroverted&quot; as other organizations like the NAACP or <i>insert any number of Women&#x27;s groups</i>. Smart? Sure. Strong? Not so much. I think the new show &quot;Fresh Off the Boat&quot; is trying to put an Asian family in the spotlight, but even then, it feels... weak. As in, the dad seems so shy and quiet... good father, hard working, but there isn&#x27;t this feeling of strong like other characters in other shows. Maybe I&#x27;m reaching for too much for a single show, but it&#x27;d be great to have stronger Asian role models. At the end of the day, it feels as if many Asians don&#x27;t actually relate or band together into a stronger &quot;coalition&quot;.",1425573677

The language in isolation is boring and perhaps even anachronistic: a modern ALGOL dialect with first-class green threads.<p>But as many people have said, the tooling and the libraries are simply top-notch. This is unsurprising: the people behind Go all have experience with things such as Research Unix, Plan 9 and just infrastructure in general. They&#x27;ve been instrumental in shaping up the lower level workings of our present systems, so they&#x27;re intimately aware of those aspects. 9P, Acme, rio, the Acid debugger, the Plan 9 compiler collection... among other tools, reflect that their brilliance is in engineering rather than science.<p>But more importantly: these people are experts in managing complexity and <i>integrating</i> things. Thus, in isolation, Go&#x27;s components look bland and uninteresting. Cumulatively, they form a unique experience. Hence why Go has such a strong culture of &quot;pragmatism&quot; that a lot of PL geeks scoff at.<p>So I&#x27;ve pretty much stopped thinking of Go the language, but rather Go the toolchain.",1425573673

Have you honestly never cracked a sexist joke with a friend in a bar? A racist joke? You sure you never laughed a bit too hard at that picture about Irish yoga? Alcoholism is no joke!</i><p>Sexist and racist jokes? No, I don&#x27;t, and I don&#x27;t associate with people who use them. Now, and this is important: I didn&#x27;t call Hank&#x27;s joke &quot;sexist&quot;, I called it &quot;sexualized&quot;, because I think intent does matter. I don&#x27;t think Hank&#x27;s intent was sexist. But Hank needs to understand that a joke like this with a sexual context, in the absence of mitigating factors, does contribute to that just-us-guys, implicitly-othering culture that doesn&#x27;t need to outright <i>say</i> &quot;no girls allowed&quot; to make it <i>feel</i> that way. That culture is not only kind of deleterious in general, but just wholly inappropriate in professional a setting. It&#x27;s a crap joke, and one that I can easily understand being hurtful and exclusionary. In a managerial position, I wouldn&#x27;t fire Hank for it, but I&#x27;d probably have given him a ration of shit for poor judgment.<p>It&#x27;s important for me to stress that this is not to say that you cannot joke about sex or race. But it&#x27;s not funny when you punch downward. Louis CK is a wonderful example of this. His jokes reference women and minorities all the time--but the jokes aren&#x27;t about them, they&#x27;re about <i>him</i> and his reactions to them based on his own personal context. He&#x27;s asking us to laugh at him, not to laugh at the person who is, by and large, probably getting a way worse deal in life than he is. Lots of his fans don&#x27;t get that, and this is also why Dave Chappelle walked away from Chappelle&#x27;s Show: it&#x27;s hard to do that kind of comedy when your audience doesn&#x27;t get the joke.<p><i>> We don&#x27;t indulge many other symptoms of emotional immaturity.

Even setting aside the personal context described in the article, there is a metric shit-ton of cultural context in both tech and in America as a whole that means that somebody like me is starting at third base when somebody else isn&#x27;t even getting out of the batter&#x27;s box and it&#x27;s neither just nor fair for me to use that against them when they react accordingly.<p>I am a straight, white male. I have it <i>really good</i> in the United States. I recognize that others do not.

9151707,comment,9150899,9151222,0,0,api,,,"&quot;And it may be that it intimidates more women than men.&quot;<p>I&#x27;ve been looking around for a developer recently, and in looking at the profiles of women vs. men at places like AngelList I noticed a few key differences in how they described themselves. We&#x27;re talking about people with very similar academic backgrounds here with similar levels of experience.<p>Women would say things like &quot;I worked on a team that did X,&quot; while men -- who obviously did the same kind of work -- would simply say &quot;I did X.&quot; Women would highlight the cooperative nature of their work, while men would give the impression that they did it all themselves. In my experience the former is typically more honest, especially if you actually were working on a team or on a team-oriented college project.<p>Women also tend to highlight team-oriented and non-technical skills more than men in general, which to techie-minded hacker types gives the impression that they are not strong on the technical end.<p>I also noted my reaction to these differences. Introspecting, I noticed that I tended to assume that &quot;being on a team&quot; meant riding the coattails of the other team members. If I noted this bias in myself, it&#x27;s probably pretty common.<p>I decided to try to de-program myself of this bias by thinking of all the counter-examples I&#x27;ve seen.<p>I do believe in the &quot;10X programmer&quot; -- for the simple reason that there are 10X everything elses. There are 10X athletes, 10X businesspeople/salespeople, 10X artists, 10X anythings. When we look for employees or contractors we are looking for that 10X standout, or at least someone who&#x27;s going to grow into one. But being really good at something is not mutually exclusive with working on a team or highlighting non-technical skills, and the inverse is also not correlated. I&#x27;ve met plenty of monomaniacal &quot;closet programmers&quot; who really aren&#x27;t any good. They sit alone stewing in their huge egos and churn out crap. (But then again I&#x27;ve met some who are. There does not seem to be a strong correlation.)<p>There&#x27;s probably quite a few really talented female programmers out there who are being passed over because they don&#x27;t conform to the &quot;whip it out and let me measure it&quot; customs of technical recruitment. I also suspect that this does drive women from the field.",1425572812

Or at the very least spent a fair bit of time reading about what people who have tried it see as the pluses and minuses. But somehow we get to questions of discrimination in tech, an article can&#x27;t be up for 10 minutes before somebody feels free to opine based on no knowledge whatsoever.<p>I find it maddening. Partly because so many of these people seem to think it&#x27;s somebody else&#x27;s job to <i>argue</i> them into an understanding. (Rather than, say, their responsibility to do a Google search and read for a whole hour.) And partly because it traps these discussions at a level of &quot;let&#x27;s explain Discrimination 101&quot; over and over and over.<p>But to answer your direct point: your hypothesis that &quot;people do what they want to do&quot; is obviously worthless when you look at actual data on what people do.

I used to travel to Palo Alto and Menlo Park a lot for business a few years back. I don&#x27;t have a drivers license, so I experimented with how possible it was to stay at various hotels while walking as much as possible (didn&#x27;t want to depend on co-workers or cabs to get everywhere, and I like walking).<p>At one point I stayed in Atherton and walked to/from offices in Menlo Park. People probably thought I was pretty crazy, but to me the <i>distance</i> was no more than what I&#x27;m used to, and the &quot;commute&quot; length was shorter.<p>But what got me was the structure of these - by US standards - quite reasonably pedestrian friendly small towns. If you lived right next to Menlo Park or Redwood City or Palo Alto town centres, a lot of things would be within walking distance. But basics were missing. Such as grocery stores. I soon learned to pick hotels in suitable locations to be within walking distance of somewhere where it&#x27;d be possible to actually find a decent selection of food nearby (eating out every day gets boring surprisingly quickly).<p>On top of the distance, the pedestrian friendly areas were &quot;islands&quot; not linked in any reasonable way. E.g. from Menlo Park to Atherton or Redwood City it seemed to me I had the choice between walking down El Camino Real, including a long stretch with pretty much no roadside lighting (fun walk back late evenings) and no sidewalk (for those unfamiliar, El Camino Real is one of the main roads in the area and heavily trafficked), or taking a huge - 3 times the walking distance or so - (but scenic) detour through back roads past Atherton estates.<p>(Amusingly, as I tried the backroads through Atherton, everyone I met greeted me as I walked past. It seemed like people assumed I must belong there, because why else would I be walking there? (I&#x27;m used to people being more friendly in California than I&#x27;m used to from London, but this was a huge step up).)<p>This is not about density, though density helps, but about a culture where everything is centralised because everyone drives, and where everyone drives because everything is centralised.",1425572256

Actually, I&#x27;m not even sure the one guy has finished his degree yet. Regardless, neither of them had their degrees when they started working for me.<p>And honestly, I didn&#x27;t really even know. I never asked them for a resume and they never provided one.<p>I don&#x27;t really test the people I hire. I get to know them on a personal level. I meet them at parties, at meetups, conferences, etc. I then ask if they&#x27;d like to make a little side money with a freelance gig. We talk about the work, and if the person says they can do it, I give them a task. A real task, it goes right into the project I&#x27;m working on. It usually takes about a week or two.<p>And if they do a good job, I ask them to do more. If they don&#x27;t, I pay them for the work they did, thank them, and don&#x27;t mention they were ever interviewing for a more long-term relationship.<p>This has been so incredibly much better of an experience than the hiring processes I was involved with as a working stiff. Resumes that don&#x27;t say shit. Stupidly simplistic coding tests. Interviewing anxiety. All of it, a nightmare.<p>And it didn&#x27;t seem to make any difference. We would put more and more effort into hiring, to the point I was spending 10 to 15 hours interviewing and reviewing candidates a week, for weeks on end. It was having a detrimental impact on <i>my</i> performance, without any correlated impact on the performance of the people we hired.<p>So when I went independent, I decided that, if the results are really, actually random, then that means the inputs have no impact. So I threw away the interviewing process. I just ask people, &quot;can you do this job&quot;?<p>And really, I don&#x27;t need to know anything else. That&#x27;s what it all boils down to. They can lie on their resume just as much as they can lie to the question. They can cram on interview questions the night before.

Successful intentional examples of this include BASIC, Logo, Hypercard, and PHP.<p>History shows that people are willing to use these until they realize that programming is hard, and then they hire someone to do it for them.  History also shows that developers are completely oblivious to the actual challenges that end users will face until they put it in front of them.  For a random example, most developers will hapilly expose the file system to users without realizing that in usability studies, most computer using college graduates do not understand the idea of a file system with directories inside of directories, files at every level, and two files named the same thing in two different directories actually being different files.<p>You can&#x27;t develop something for people who don&#x27;t code without putting it in front of people who don&#x27;t code and accepting harsh feedback.

Therefore no matter how much you don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re in competition with mainstream programming environments, you really, really are.<p>Don&#x27;t believe me?  Excel has proven to be an insanely successful technology for getting non-programmers to write useful applications.  Ever talked to a programmer who inherited a complex application written in Excel by a non-programmer?  My point is made.<p>I am sure the YC person is as aware of this as I am.  What do we have?  We have a team that devoted an insane amount of time in creating a piece of cool technology which certainly is useless for its target purpose.  This team clearly has no idea how to make something that customers want.  Furthermore they don&#x27;t show any sign of caring about how to make a successful business.  They may be fun to talk to about technology, but is this a group you want to invest in?<p>YC made the obviously right choice here.  And asked the right questions.",1425572003

Everyone near you gets hurt, but especially you.<p>There is an entire subculture on the Internet entirely devoted to disproving, with a vengeance, the phrase &quot;sticks and stones will break my bones, but names will never hurt me&quot;.  They are trolls, pursuing the idea that a carefully selected assemblage of words can reduce a person to a quivering wreck of human jelly.<p>Then there are the dirt-diggers and the doxers, who will scrutinize your life more carefully than a political party looking for a presidential candidate, and circle with a highlighter every embarrassing thing you have ever done.<p>There are the holy warriors, who will tolerate no heresies against their chosen cause, especially those done unwittingly, in apparent ignorance that a controversy even exists--for the holy warriors on the other side have, of course, already chosen their path to damnation.<p>And there are the cruel pranksters, who will summon a SWAT team to your house, looking for your cash, heroin, and slaves.  They&#x27;ll DDoS your employer until you are fired.  They&#x27;ll crack your passwords and post dick pics using your account.<p>But there&#x27;s a delicate sort of detente with all these groups.  They have, however twisted, a sense of justice.  The very worst of them will leave the truly innocent untouched, as though it were all a game, the only legitimate targets are the other players, and cheaters must be punished.  The trolls attack pompous, self-righteous windbags.  The doxers expose those who abuse their anonymity (such as the trolls and the other doxers).  The holy warriors mock those with unfounded or irrational beliefs.  And the cruel pranksters follow Machiavelli&#x27;s blueprint to make the Internet respected, through terrorism.<p>These are people who have probably never felt any sort of power before, in any other aspect of their lives.  Doing one of those things may be the only time they have ever felt like they ever made a difference in the world, even if it was a difference with dubious worth.  Before the Internet, those types of personalities would have to be board members for homeowners&#x27; associations or local government officials or on the council for their churches or civic groups in order to feel more powerful.  That limited the scope of the damage they could potentially do.<p>All of this misbehavior that we see on the Internet is a symptom.  The cause is (in part) the systematic disenfranchisement of the poor and middle class, around the world.

9151509,comment,9150927,9150927,0,0,copsarebastards,,,"I&#x27;ve long supported a proof-of-work concept augmented with whitelisted keys for email spam filtering.<p>There are basically two cases here:<p>1. The sender is sending one email to one receiver. The sender computes the proof of work and sends it along with the message. This takes some time, but typically it can be done in the background. Waiting few seconds between sending and receiving an email is typically not an issue, and in fact many email clients wait for some time before sending anyway to allow &quot;undo send&quot; functionality. Rather that doing this computation on the mail server, it should be done on the sender&#x27;s client, so that the server doesn&#x27;t get overloaded with proof-of-work computations.<p>2. The sender is sending many emails to many receivers (a mailing list). In this case when the receiver signs up for the mailing list, the sender sends a request for a whitelist token to the receiver&#x27;s mail server. IF the user accepts the request, the receiver&#x27;s mail server returns the token and then the sender sends all further communication with the token instead of with a proof-of-work. This solves a few problems: a) Receivers opt <i>in</i> rather than opting <i>out</i> of receiving communications. The ubiquitous pre-checked &quot;send me spam&quot; checkbox loses its effectiveness. b) Receivers can revoke tokens at any time. c) Senders who are sending large amounts of legitimate mail don&#x27;t have to compute a proof-of-work for every email they send.<p>Receivers simply drop email which doesn&#x27;t come with either a proof-of-work or a whitelist token. This drives up the cost of sending large numbers of spam emails because each spam email requires a large amount of computation. And even in cases where a spammer has a large amount of computation at their disposal (botnets are a common case) it makes it easier for servers to distinguish between mailing lists and spam: a large number of identical emails could be either, but mailing list mailings should come with a whitelist token.<p>Doing things this way would mean we can drop these terrible DKIM and SPF systems that both fail to prevent spam and make it difficult to send legitimate mail.",1425571511

The algorithm that is going to calculate the exact percent is yet to be created.<p>- user experience is the most important thing for me, if it  is good and not intruding, it will help developers to stick in the application longer and learn more things (I guess)<p>- my hope is that the content (best practices and exercises) will be constantly updated and written by the best developers in the field or by authors that will be specifically chosen for that purpose",1425571284

If you want it thinner, it becomes transparent. It ends up taking FOREVER to slice because it just shreds to some extent. It&#x27;s no longer slices, but a pile of shredded meat.",1425571270

The interview process is irreducibly stressful, but that doesn&#x27;t mean we have to go out of our way to make it worse. It isn&#x27;t even good for hiring most men either, after all! It&#x27;s just a bad idea.<p>I&#x27;ve personally had fairly good success hiring people who happen to be women, and I suspect a good part of that is that my interview attitude is that I&#x27;m there to find out what you <i>can</i> do, not to find out what you can&#x27;t, which seems to be the unexamined default of a lot of interviewers. You don&#x27;t start at &quot;perfect&quot; and get marks off for failure... you start at essentially zero and work your way up. &quot;Starting at zero&quot; may sound superficially harsh when I put it into English, but in practice this produces a much friendlier interview environment, I think, because we&#x27;re discovering positive aspects instead of negative ones.<p>(Another reason to prefer this is that in practice this also helps avoid the problem of the senior candidate being thrown softballs, or the junior candidate being asked to design a cloud infrastructure. It really doesn&#x27;t take that long for me to key in on where your most likely &quot;knowledge frontier&quot; is and probe for details there. As opposed to just going through a rote set of questions looking for demerits. It <i>is</i> a harder style of interviewing, though, precisely because you can&#x27;t just go through a rote set of questions... even the standard question set I use has a lot of ways of approaching them and several &quot;levels of detail&quot; I can get into depending on experience and skill level.)<p>The end result is still, frankly, stressful. It&#x27;s a big deal, and the interviewee would have to be outright irrational to forget that. But it helps if you as an interviewer remember that, too, and have some compassion.",1425571259

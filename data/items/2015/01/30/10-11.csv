My then gf bought a bedspread by an artist called Ken Done - lots of bright primary colours.<p>It looked great in Sydney.<p>In UK light - even in sunlight - most of the colour punch disappeared. It actually looked kind of grey and old. Disappointment...<p>So if supersaturate movie colours, they look surreal here.<p>But California really <i>is</i> teal and orange. The light is warm and intense, and LA gets a lot of clear blue sky. So I wonder if directors like TnO because it&#x27;s a variation on natural Hollywood light.",1422615535

A microchurch (well, any healthy church) needs safe electronic places to have peer-to-peer and peer-to-trusted-friends communication.<p>And by safe, I mean medical records, bank balance, and legal advice safe. Despite the article in The Guardian (if coffee-induced anxiety is your biggest problem...), lots of real spiritual needs happen around very important but sensitive topics that any wise person would be discrete about: sex (in and out of marriage), marriage crisis, unplanned pregnancies, money, addiction, physical health, mental health, fertility problems, problems with coworkers, and the list goes on. Right now, electronically, the only options are to say nothing to nobody or post this sort of information on facebook or something similar.<p>So I still circle back to &quot;hyperlocal&quot; for now. People need a lot of courage and (usually) a lot of quality time to get to the point where they&#x27;ll let down their guards and be honest.

But if you have static typing and no generics to make it work you have to either:<p>- create two versions of the same function, one for Objects, 2nd for Arrays<p>- use <i>any</i> as a type of <i>input</i> - this will work, but you will loose most of the benefits of type checking, e.g. you will be also able to pass Number as an input and compiler won&#x27;t complain, it will be detected as error only on runtime and other things (your function will also return <i>any</i> so further on in the program you won&#x27;t know what type is used).<p>With generic it&#x27;s easy, you write the function once and when you call it you tell what types are used:<p><pre><code>  // definition:\n  function addKey<X,Y,Z>(input:X, key:Y, value:Z):X { ... }\n  // call:\n  var a = addKey<Array<string>,Number,string>([],0,&quot;fubar&quot;);\n</code></pre>\nWith this particular example there are probably other ways as well (sum types, common interface) and also compiler may actually detect passing Number as an error (depends how smart it is), but there are more complex cases, where lack of generics will lead to a lot of copy/pasting and boilerplate.",1422612404

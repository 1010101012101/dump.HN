2829358,comment,2828975,2829251,8,0,cletus,,,"Perhaps I'm being overly pessimistic but I see Twitter as this decade's Myspace.<p>Myspace was generational. A given (mostly teenager) demographic used it through the early to mid part of the last decade. It was, as we all know, supplanted by Facebook. There are many reasons for this, among them that Myspace (IMHO) sat on their laurels and that broader appeal (ie FB's cleaner page design rather than the Flash-swamped monstrosity that was Myspace) ultimately won out.<p>Twitter was and is touted as a means to:<p>1. send status updates to your friends (original idea);<p>2. disseminate news; and<p>3. follow ""celebrities"" (broader than the Hollywood notion of celbrities).<p>In spite of Twitter's stated 175 million accounts [1], how many uses does Twitter REALLY have? [2]. They don't state their 1, 7 and 30 day actives. As another example, Facebook's 750 million users is ""monthly actives' [3].<p>Registered accounts and monthly active users are an important distinction, particularly for Twitter as it appears many people signup, try it out and then ""leave"". I believe that this problem is far bigger than Twitter has let on.<p>I simply don't see use (1) taking off. Twitter seems to be a medium for (3). There is definitely a market for that but I think it's a fragile one, easily replaced by something else.<p>That leaves (2), which is a complicated story. If there's two things podcasters (particularly former journalists, in the traditional sense) like to wax lyrical about it's the death of newspapers and how Twitter is changing the (journalistic) world, both of which are now boring (to me).<p>Twitter suffers from what I call ""bubble thinking"", much like Quora does. People in the Valley, in social media, etc think its huge. Normals have, by now, probably heard of it but won't necessarily even know what it is (let alone use the service).<p>My (unsubstantiated) feeling is that big brands haven't embraced advertising on Twitter. They're simply playing with it. Twitter advertising suffers from the same problems Facebook advertising does: unlike Google, which has the huge benefit of <i>intent</i> (you're searching for something, so Google knows your intent is to find out something about it, a natural fit for advertising), most people view such advertising as noise unrelated to what they're doing.<p>In Twitter's case it's exacerbated by their 140 character message format and the heavy reliance by users on third-party clients that Twitter doesn't control.<p>I know it's hip to not worry about how you monetize something in the Valley. While I generally agree with that sentiment, I think Twitter has gotten to the point where it's now a problem.<p>They recently had an $800 funding round. A profitable company doesn't do that. What I'd be looking at is this: where is that $800 million going? Is it largely paying out early investors? If so, run away. Run as fast as you can (much like Groupon).<p>[1]: <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2010/10/31/twitter-users/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techcrunch.com/2010/10/31/twitter-users/</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/chart-of-the-day-how-many-users-does-twitter-really-have-2011-3"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businessinsider.com/chart-of-the-day-how-many-use...</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2011/06/23/facebook-750-million-users/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techcrunch.com/2011/06/23/facebook-750-million-users/</a>",1312141946

Many of these groups conduct a fair amount of discussion and training pretty out in the open, confident of their status as out of the reach of western justice. Specific techniques and code present in a pair of Adobe 0-days used this spring point very loudly back to one collective and probably one or two specific actors that talk about these techniques in public in person. There are strong rumors that the night dragon intrusions track back to a specific actor. I've seen private investigator reports tailing specific intruders who verify that monitored intrusions happen reliably just minutes after people they have full dossiers on show up at their office. With many intrusions it's clear that the long term hosts are complicit in the bahvior. The wall of proxies defense tends to or at least can fall down against determined back hacking of the client.<p>All of these circumstances may not be the norm, but they exist. More would exist if there were more incentives to develop this kind of intelligence. The basic problem now is OK - what do you do with that info? NSA offensive security practices are not built for or available to the private sector. However, it seems very possible that these individual actors could be dissuaded, harassed, redirected or worse given the right program.<p>I'm not speaking of a state vs. state MAD.

I built a quick mockup using cardboard and string, and although obviously the pro version has much more comfortable straps, I feel like it still places the laptop too low, while the strap around your shoulders encourages you to look down. Not good for posture and moving the laptop up makes it uncomfortably close to the face.<p>What I really want is a harness that suspends the laptop at about the place I hold it up to use it, which is significantly higher and further from me than my waist and ideally it should be supported from my waist rather than my shoulders.<p>I think this is actually a feasible thing to makeI'm going to play around with cardboard some more.<p>Edit: Okay, my second prototype consists of a board, about 8""x12"", which sticks up from my waist the long way at about a 30 angle. A strap connects the far end of the board around my lower back, which holds the board up; the laptop sits away from me on the board, with the front end resting on the straps.<p>Pic for reference: <a href=""http://imgur.com/OOf42"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imgur.com/OOf42</a><p>I'm typing this using it right now. The laptop ergonomics themselves are pretty nice, exactly the holding-the-laptop-but-type-with-both-hands feeling I was going for. The prototype apparatus is obviously way uncomfortable, though. A padded waist piece and strap would probably make it perfect, but I would still want to investigate the effect of the shear forces on my spine before using this full-time. (Proposal: Trade in the strap for a rigid structure, counterweight the back. Better proposal: Counterweight the back with extra battery for the laptop.)<p>Honestly, aside from more comfortable and adjustable pieces, this is pretty much what I want. So, uh... does anyone make something like that? :) (Another crucial feature would be a non-load-bearing safety strap that does go around my neckI tested the harness pretty carefully before trusting the laptop to it, and it was sturdy as a rock, but it still <i>feels</i> flimsy.)",1312140614

account/savings account; receive a bank's interest on the EUR.  As
customers demand the BTC in the amounts enumerated in BTC that you
still owe them (in great numbers after some announcement like the
above, or otherwise), buy BTC with EUR and sell it to the customers.
Pray continuously that you don't lose your shirt with these
conversions, particularly given that unexpected spikes in BTC demand
will come precisely at those times that you'll tend to lose out on a
conversion.<p>You might, extremely conservatively, sell BTC to people in exchange
for a promise of a greater amount of future BTC (i.e., you might lend
BTC out).  Step 1 in that scheme: find anyone who will borrow BTC who
isn't either a lunatic (and therefore unlikely to be able to repay the
loan) or a thief.  After subtracting lunatics and thieves, you're left
with people who will take some BTC, sell it for EUR, attempt to make
money, and then at a future date buy BTC for with any EUR they've
made.  I.e., with people who will need to pray almost as hard and as
long and with as much chicken blood and magic circles as an exchange
that took your suggestion to get interest from a bank.  Your
borrowers won't have to fear a sudden demand for the money, but
they'll still have to fear the BTC:EUR exchange rate.<p>Meanwhile, approximately 100% of BTC holders are speculating in the currency.",1312140409

There again, you'll need to posture as larger and more stable than you are.<p>But just because you're at a disadvantage in these types of sales, I still wouldn't recommend misleading anyone, since it's inviting disaster -- I'd suggest choosing products/customers where small is okay.<p>One time purchases that don't rely on support, upgrades, or workflow changes are easiest for big customers to buy from startups. On the other hand, consumers enjoy supporting small businesses with small purchases, so I think it's always in you radvantage to be honest there.<p>Jason Cohen's post on this is good and he's far more knowledgable than I: <a href=""http://blog.asmartbear.com/convert-shortcomings-into-advantages-without-lying.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.asmartbear.com/convert-shortcomings-into-advanta...</a>",1312140162

I know nothing about Square's internal infrastructure - but they are either paying ~3% to some other payment processor, or have become their own processor and are paying ~2% in interchange fees directly to the issuing bank. So, in the best case, Square is pulling in closer to ~0.75% => $30K/day in revenue.<p>To make matters worse, that 2% in interchange fees is an average across all credit card transactions. But most interchange agreements are ""fixed fee + percent of transaction"" and I suspect Square's average transaction is significantly smaller than the average credit card transaction. That would imply their cut is even <i>smaller</i> than the 0.75% that it would be otherwise.<p>On the plus side, at scale Square should be able to directly negotiate better interchange fees with issuing banks - but I'd be very surprised if they ever drop below 1% on average. It would be impressive (but possible, given Square's pull in the industry via Visa et al.), that they've already pulled off some agreement to that effect.",1312140024

The lottery commission then picks six distinct integers at random from the set {1..46}, effectively by drawing numbered balls without replacement from an urn. The payouts for May 9, 2011 were $24821 for a match-5 (a ticket that has 5 numbers in common with the set chosen by the lottery), $824 for a match-4, and $26 for a match-3 (<a href=""http://goo.gl/gSTsF"" rel=""nofollow"">http://goo.gl/gSTsF</a>).

the probability of a match-5 is 1/39028.41, the probability of match-4 is

When you can only buy a few tickets in a lottery like this, the distribution of the numbers on your tickets greatly affects your chances of coming out ahead.  For instance, if you buy 5,000 copies of the ticket {1,2,3,4,5,6}, your chances of coming out ahead are much worse than if you buy 5,000 tickets with a bunch of different numbers, although of course your expected winnings are the same in each case, provided no one hits the jackpot.<p>It's actually an open problem to create a set of 5,000 Cash WinFall tickets that maximize your chances of coming out ahead.

It's great; I will recommend it to anyone.<p>It takes a while to build up the stamina to stand. When you first switch you need frequent breaks during the day. Having a high chair is crucial during this time. As your stamina improves, you begin to be able to handle standing an entire day, but you're still sore after a few days or a week. You're a bit more tired on the weekend. After a few months, you can stand all day long for days on end with no fatigue. That's the point where you get the benefit.<p>After switching to a standing desk months ago, I found that I had vastly more energy during my vacation to Europe. I would walk and explore a city and be active all day long with virtually no fatigue at all. My stamina beat out my companions' significantly, even people who are otherwise much more active than I am. Standing for 8 - 10 hours per day provides a huge stamina boost when you adjust to it.<p>It's important to ergonomically adjust your desk so that it's in the correct position, of course. Stand normally with your arms limp at your sides. Now, without moving your elbows, bring your hands up such that your forearms are horizontal, hands straight in front of you. Your hands now indicate where your keyboard should be -- roughly an inch or two below your elbow height. Your mouse should also be reachable from that position without moving your elbow.<p>Standing burns twice as many calories as sitting, and is overall much healthier as a daily habit. There was a study I circulated around my work (I'll see if I can find a link; it may be the same one as at author included) which compared two groups of people who were active, healthy, and fit, and did the same sort of work. One group of people sat at their job, and the other group of people stood. The study showed that people who stood had a lower incidence of heart disease, diabetes, and other ailments. Conclusion: standing is healthier, and regular exercise outside work doesn't make up for it.<p>Lastly, I've found standing more ergonomic. With a chair, you're likely to find yourself slumping somehow, on the armrest, or on the desk. With a standing desk, it's easy to follow correct posture. With a Kinesis keyboard and 3M Ergonomic Mouse (the one which looks like a joystick) I haven't experienced any ergonomics issues in a long time.<p>Regarding the article:<p>> Theres no question, standing takes more energy and tends to make you sore compared to sitting.<p>No, it does not. That's just the author building up sufficient stamina to stand.

Most of my leg and foot discomfort has gone now.<p>My leg strength stays much higher than it used to, as you might imagine.  One bike ride per week sustains the muscle that used to require three rides, if you see what I mean.<p>I'm generally more alert while standing up.  When I sit, I have to tap a foot or something, otherwise I'll start getting sleepy.  This has always been the case, it's just a bit more noticeable when I spend more of the day standing.<p>The standing desk has helped tremendously with my posture, but has, to some degree, exacerbated my shoulder/neck issues.  Specifically, holding good posture in a standing position lends itself to a knot in a trapezius muscle, which causes pain and nerve irritation.<p>I'm currently thinking that switching between standing and sitting will yield the best results.  To that end, I'm considering building a sliding desk platform out of 8020 parts (<a href=""http://www.8020.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.8020.net/</a>).",1312139277

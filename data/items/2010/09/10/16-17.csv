(and other questions)",,"I have worked with Drupal for a few years now and faced lots of opposition once my clients learn about what's behind it. I have heard many descriptions about it [As an MVC, CMS, or PHP platform], along with many developers that ask specifics about its magical database layer.

The primary difference being is if your company goes under, those guys get taken care of first.<p>Vesting periods usually work like this:<p>You have a cliff -- which is, essentially, a time gate that says ""if you leave before date x, you get no shares. after date x, you are able to purchase all of the shares you earned prior to date x (in your case probably 12/60ths of total allotment) and earn the right to purchase an additional 1/60th of your options every month thereafter.""<p>What happens if you are acquired?

A small number of gifted children have, in my experience, been able to work out their own methods, and they've become more efficient over time, and eventually converged to something isomorphic to long multiplication.<p>But this is not the norm.<p>Evidence suggests - and my experience agrees - that <i>correctly</i> teaching process creates the ground-work for moving to understanding.  <i>Correct</i> methods, practised over time and in different context, result in an internalisation that leads to an ability to generalise and apply in wider contexts.<p>This is my point about research and evidence-based teaching systems.  The existing fads are borne of insufficiently researched and poorly developed methods, badly applied.  They are often driven by dogma, and then delivered by teachers who don't properly understand what they're doing.<p>There has to be a better way, and unfortunately, nearly everyone has an opinion, and none of them are supported by anything like enough evidence.  And so we continue to damage our children.<p>In parting, much of what you say I agree with, but not all.

The App Store is flooded with mass-produced low-quality low-demand junk apps so that a coding sweatshop in east Asia can make a few bucks per app, times however many thousands they churn out. THEY are who will be rejected, rather than someone with a good, novel, new, or beneficial idea.<p>Second is the thought that Google will solve the App Store's search and filtering issues. Has the author of this article used the Android Market? For being backed by the pinnacle of search providers, the Android Market's search and filtering capabilities are abysmal, and are actually outdone by small-time independent groups like AppBrain.<p>Apple DOES have enough fart apps.

When this happens, you hope the shares are worth more than your option price. If so, you can exercise your options and make  profit between your option price and the current price. This is the zero risk way to do it.<p><i>Also it looks like it will take five years to vest, so what happens if the company is acquired/goes public between now and then?</i><p>You should have some sort of vesting schedule in your packet. I'm guessing that within 5 years all your options will be vested, but between now until then, your options vest as you work. This is because your startup doesn't want to just give out boatloads of options to people who are going to leave.

I have an MA in Math Education, and am currently working on a PhD in Education, so I have had a lot of first-hand experience with ""how the sausage is made"" with regards to education research.<p>Teaching fads are all coming from research-oriented schools of education like those that I am getting my degree from. While the new methods that are being introduced are ""research based"", I find much of the research being conducted as highly questionable. Since around the 1970s there has been a strong shift away from quantitative research towards qualitative research in education, which IMHO allows researchers to pretty much ""prove"" anything that they want. I think that when most people hear the phrase ""better teaching methods"" they tend to assume that this means ""better ways of getting students to learn the target curriculum"", but in my experience actual mastery of, say, math skills now takes a back seat to, for example, higher self esteem or even just hating math less.<p>The result is that over the past several decades students in the US, at least, where such trends towards new teaching methods seem to be the strongest, are performing worse and worse on international comparisons of math and science skills (see, for example, the TIMMS: <a href=""http://nces.ed.gov/timss/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nces.ed.gov/timss/</a>). Meanwhile the countries that now have the best performing students in terms of mathematics ability are largely from Asian countries that predominantly use methods now considered passe here.<p>The elephant in the room is that the biggest reasons for poor math skills are not related to teaching methods, but rather are cultural issues---starting especially in the middle school years, most students just don't want to be seen as being good at math, as that can be a social stigma for many students of that age (I'm sure that many readers of this site can relate...).<p>A student who <i>wants</i> to learn will do so, no matter how bad the teacher or the teacher's methods.

If you read <i>The Homework Myth</i> you'll find out that homework in grade school is a net neutral from a learning perspective.  The benefit is that you get more practice.  The downfall is that without supervision it is as easy to practice the wrong thing as the right thing, and practicing the wrong thing sets you back.<p>Studies have shown that, in practice, the net effect is that homework causes academic performance to become more strongly correlated with the parent's socioeconomic status, but overall across the whole population there is no net change in learning outcomes.  Plus assigning homework is a source of stress for families that causes students to dislike school.  The strength of these effects is roughly linear in the amount of homework assigned, all of the way down to no homework at all.  (Instead students have to do in class exercises, under the supervision of teachers.  Which they have to do anyways.)<p>The reason for that is that homework causes enforcing correct practice to be the job of the parents, and so how well the parents understand the material determines whether homework benefits or hurts.  While my family educationally benefits from the trend (me and my wife can assist correct practice), reduced stress and inequality makes no homework seem fair to me.<p>And hence the problem underscored by this article.  With homework, when we teach students different techniques, we need to think both about how easily the students will learn them, and how well the parents will understand them.  Without homework the parents lose that responsibility, and we're free to just focus on what works for the kids.",1284136340

Part of this is that teachers tend to have a poor quantitative background themselves, so they can do math but they don't grok it. I've seen transcripts of grade school teacher math lessons, and it's clear that they perceive math in a legalistic sense, using phrases like ""those are the rules, right?"" The result is that the students only see a set of rules, and not the reasoning, so the set of rules looks basically arbitrary.<p>If you explain well enough the concepts of place-value and multiplication, most children can independently invent an algorithm for long multiplication. They tend to arrive at similar solutions which aren't as well-organized or space-optimized as the traditional long multiplication algorithm, but they made it themselves so they understand not just how to do it but why it works.<p>The exact algorithms being taught for math education may make a difference in exposing the concepts, but I think the real determiner of math education is not the algorithms but how the material is presented. Addition and multiplication make sense, if they're taught as concepts, but the focus on test scores emphasizes ability to plug-and-chug over ability to understand what's going on under the hood. This is also why everybody hates word problems, and why I think math testing should use more word problems. Math isn't about your ability to perform rote tasks, it's about your ability to apply general concepts to specific situations, and that in itself is as important as the rest of schooling combined (indeed, it makes the rest of schooling useful).<p>Relevant parting anecdote: some school district knew that the Pythagorean Theorem would be on their standardized algebra tests that year, so they drilled all their students on it. The students could use the formula flawlessly. The test rolled around, and surprise! the Pythagorean Theorem question was a word problem, and most of the students bombed the question.",1284136003

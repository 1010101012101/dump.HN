(For that matter, despite <i>also</i> disagreeing somewhat with cstross here, I&#x27;ve also upvoted the article for being interesting; they are valid concerns.)<p>In a way, BitCoin is a mathematical fact of the universe rather than an &quot;idea for what society could choose to do&quot;. Not BitCoin specifically, but the general ideas it embodies. If BitCoin is long-term viable (which I personally doubt), or if anything <i>like</i> BitCoin is viable (which I consider somewhat likely, but not proved), it&#x27;s <i>going</i> to be created. You&#x27;re going to have to deal with the existence of it, and society is going to have to learn how to live in a universe in which it exists, just as you have to learn how to live in a universe with crime. It&#x27;s too simple to just suppress out of existence. You don&#x27;t really get a vote over BitCoin any more than you get a vote over murder.<p>(You may choose to suppress it, but you&#x27;re going to have to deal with the non-100% effectiveness of that choice somehow.)<p>#include<my_first_paragraph>",1387382398

6928214,comment,6924866,6924866,3,0,vinceguidry,,,"That they have not made available a threat model is the kicker for me. Every time people start talking about security, whether it&#x27;s their email or their house, inevitably they start going nuts with all the possibilities. They then leave real security against real threats at the door in order to deal with imagined ones that require far greater resources to secure against. I&#x27;d bet that many fortunes were made by security &#x27;professionals&#x27; catering to these whims.<p>The threat model is the antidote to this tomfoolery. Before you even start to touch a primitive, sit down and think very hard about who you&#x27;re trying to be secure against and what their available options for attacking you are. Then write this analysis down and make it a living document, referring to it constantly to make sure that what you&#x27;re writing is actually protecting you from something and what and how it&#x27;s doing that.<p>I&#x27;d go so far as to say that without such a document, a system cannot possibly be secure because it doesn&#x27;t know what it&#x27;s doing. What&#x27;s more, the poor team in charge of maintaining and updating it is going to be forever behind the curve, reduced to putting out fires whenever they pop up, be it from external actors actually breaking their code or from their own ignorance introducing vulnerabilities that weren&#x27;t there before because their updates didn&#x27;t take into account the non-existent threat model.",1387382207

6928210,comment,6927637,6927973,6,0,Brakenshire,,,"> The idea that deflation is necessarily harmful to an economy is a fallacy.<p>Well, it is undeniable that this is subject to very heated debate. Some people are monetarist, some people are not, and central bank policies shift from country to country and from generation to generation. For instance, Spain and the UK had very similar debt and deficit figures at the outset of the recession, but Spain does not control the value of its currency. The Euro is controlled by the European Central Bank, and is run primarily by German central bankers, who are strongly opposed to inflation as a lever of policy. The UK controls its own currency, and has deliberately pursued an inflationary monetary policy, and even more so with the newly appointed head of the Bank of England, Mark Carney. It is a very common opinion, in the US and the UK as well as in parts of Europe, that this is a key reason why the UK economy is doing ok, with 7.5% unemployment, while the Spanish economy remains in freefall, with 25% unemployment. Certainly, one academic study plucked off the internet, written before the current financial crisis, is unlikely to settle the issue for all time.<p>Bitcoin effectively allows individuals to bypass this debate, and put their money where they think is appropriate. But, of course, the individual who is saving money always wants to avoid inflation, so will put their money where it will maintain its value. Whether this is positive, or indeed sustainable for the rest of the economy, is, as I say, a matter for debate.",1387382186

Some major banks (BoA, Chase, WellsFargo, etc.) ran newer machines that had fancier features like check image recognition.  Those meant a move to newer OSes but that was a limited case.<p>The actual reason OS/2 is gone and all these ATMS are running Windows is because of companies like NCR and Diebold lobbying the government to put new language in the Americans with Disabilities Act [1].  It required every ATM to be capable of text-to-speech translation which the older hardware and OS/2 systems were not capable of (most of the machines I was pulling had 133Mhz processors and less than 64MB of RAM).  This meant 1) new hardware sales, 2) new software sales, and 3) selling custom ad campaigns to run on the shiny new color screens and new hardware.<p>The industry had been stagnant for awhile in hardware and software sales, the deadline of March 15, 2012 was a great shot in the arm for NCR and Diebold.  Lest you think this really was about helping people with disabilities, the vast majority of ATMs that I &#x27;upgraded&#x27; were drive-through units sitting on concrete pallets in bank parking lots too high or too inconveniently placed for anyone to use unless they were driving in a car.  I did get some very positive feedback from the blind and their friends(who knew the IRS employs so many blind folk?) when I installed some of the walk-up units, but the large majority were drive-throughs.<p>[1] - <a href=\"http://www.americanbanker.com/magazine/121_10/atm-accessibility-ada-compliance-1042410-1.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.americanbanker.com/magazine/121_10/atm-accessibil...</a>",1387381381

Once its removed and shipped out, its gone, and all the money in the world isn&#x27;t going to make shippable product appear out of thin air.<p>You&#x27;re talking about two different scales.  MX will never pump more oil than they did at peak a long time ago.  That doesn&#x27;t mean fat stacks of cash can&#x27;t be made on the downslope or political intrigue can&#x27;t be useful.  For example, petroleum revenue declines are already causing a financial / political crisis in MX so transferring the blame from PEMEX to &quot;vague groups of rich foreigners&quot; is a wise political move as its always better for a local to blame the foreigners than the other locals.  So the Cantarell tank is almost empty, almost entirely pumped out; better to blame Exxon than the CEO of PEMEX, at least if you&#x27;re the leader of MX, at least on paper (the actual guys running MX are the drug gang leaders, which is a whole nother topic... take away petroleum revenues and legalize weed in the USA at the same time and MX would make Somalia look rich which is a crisis not just for MX but their neighbor to the north, which as a real political issue is why the USA will never legalize weed until long after the oil downslope is all resolved in MX... intentionally collapsing a neighboring country with a completely permeable land border is almost as dumb as the idea of the war on some drugs)",1387380870

That’s 0.03 percent of the world’s total greenhouse gas output, or equivalent to that of the nation of Cyprus. If bitcoin’s value reaches $100,000, that impact will reach 3 percent of the world’s total, or that of Germany. At $1 million – which seems farcical but which may not be out of the realm of possibility given the artificially limited bitcoin supply – this impact rises to 8.25 gigatonnes, or 30 percent of today’s global output, and equivalent to that of China and Japan combined.<p>Can someone explain to me the validity of simply multiplying the value of Bitcoin against its current percentage of world&#x27;s total greenhouse gas output? How is the carbon footprint of Bitcoin attached to the price of Bitcoin? I don&#x27;t expect that the recent halving in price caused everyone to pack up their mining rigs and returned carbon emissions to 0.015% of global emissions.<p>Not to mention this author somehow manages to keep a straight face when arguing that Bitcoin could possibly account for more emissions than China and Japan.",1387380821

In contrast, Bitcoin private keys are often stored in <i>general-purpose</i> personal computers running a wide variety of applications, managed by people who don&#x27;t know how to secure a computer.<p>* Transporting any substantial amount of paper cash or gold is often done via armored trucks operated by highly-trained security personnel.  In contrast, Bitcoin private keys are transported via all sorts of highly insecure methods by people who don&#x27;t know better.<p>* No sane person holding a substantial amount of cash or gold at home would ever let complete strangers come and go into their house as they please, while giving them keys to all doors, cabinets, drawers, and safes.  In contrast, people regularly give complete access to their computers to complete strangers by willingly or unwillingly installing software created by such strangers.<p>* Our regulatory and policing institutions know how to identify, prosecute, and even prevent illegal gold and cash transactions, successfully keeping them to a tiny percentage of overall economic activity in most advanced economies.  In contrast, those same institutions do not yet know how to cope with the use of Bitcoin for illegal activities.<p>--<p>Edits: moved comparison of Bitcoin to gold and cash to footnote; also, made minor changes to several sentences so they more accurately reflect what I intended to write in the first place.",1387380809

We can now extrapolate these figures out to 1.9 million bots and see what the total cost/impact is likely to be for the whole botnet.<p>If each KWh of electricity costs $0.162 then it would cost $0.29 to mine on a single bot for 24 hours. But multiply this figure by 1.9 million for the whole botnet and we are now looking at energy usage of 3,458,000 KWh (3,458 MWh, enough to power over 111,000 homes each day.) This amount of energy is considerably greater than the output of the largest power station in Moss Landing, California, which could produce 2,484 MW and would come with a corresponding electricity bill of $560,887 a day. Despite the costs, all this energy will create just $2165 worth of bitcoins a day!

I swerved, so did the many other cars (busy highway), anda few of us came to screeching stop a few meters away. I ran over, by an incredible miracle the lady had not been run over, and had not fallen on her head; she was alive and conscious. (her spirits were not high as one might expect after a failed suicide attempt). The other civic citizen that bended over her after having frantically (and dangerously) redirected the highway speed traffic was a black man.<p>It took a good 5-7 minutes to get the first responders on site, the police arrived first, then the ambulance. Once the  paramedics had taken over, the police wanted to take a deposition. I sat in the back of the cruiser with the black man. IIRC he was a taxi driver, I&#x27;m a white caucasian. Well folks the interview of this black man quickly turned passive agressive suspicious, to a point where I wanted to open the cruiser door and leave; well there is no door handles inside the back of a cruiser. I politely said I was done with my deposition, can I get out now? The police officer ignored my request and kept on the insidious questioning of my fellow good samaritan. I was flabbergasted. I took my phone out and called my wife and starting telling her the suicide attempt story, acting up a bit and speaking very loud and emotional. Only then the tone came down. One of the officers then opened the door for me, from the outside. I did not budge as I was giving the &quot;in shock&quot; show, and I was getting to the present of being stuck in the back of a cruiser.<p>I finally got out of the car, and stood there, on the side of the highway next to the cruiser until they let the man go.

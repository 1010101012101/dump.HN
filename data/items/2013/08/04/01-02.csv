6154249,comment,6152781,6153262,10,0,jcampbell1,,,"Someone from Google&#x27;s HR team needs to drag you into a room, and force you to read something about the art of persuasion.  You have embarrassed your project and team.  While your arguments are mostly sound, they are overly combative and largely unconvincing.  From a 70 year old book, here are some tips to &quot;Win people to your way of thinking&quot;:<p>* The only way to get the best of an argument is to avoid it.<p>* Show respect for the other person&#x27;s opinions. Never say &quot;You&#x27;re Wrong.&quot;<p>* If you&#x27;re wrong, admit it quickly and emphatically.<p>* Begin in a friendly way.<p>* Start with questions to which the other person will answer yes.<p>* Let the other person do a great deal of the talking.<p>* Let the other person feel the idea is his or hers.<p>* Try honestly to see things from the other person&#x27;s point of view.<p>* Be sympathetic with the other person&#x27;s ideas and desires.<p>* Appeal to the nobler motives.<p>* Dramatize your ideas.<p>* Throw down a challenge.<p>Frankly, you should relax.  Google&#x27;s Go ate tons of shit on HN, and now gets nothing but praise.  If you wan&#x27;t to persuade people to the way you think, then persuade people correctly.  If you are offended by some argument, grow thicker fucking skin and don&#x27;t lash back.  If you must lash back do it from a throwaway account and don&#x27;t mention you work for Google.  Let the arguments rest on their own merits.",1375581516

The whole reason that IP is called intellectual <i>property</i> is precisely to draw an analogy. Thus, the violation of that property is called theft.<p>And besides, you don&#x27;t understand theft of physical property either. It does not require physical trespass: taking someone&#x27;s wallet when they put it down on a table for a moment is theft. Theft is a transfer of possession without an accompanying transfer of ownership.<p>In intellectual property, theft is a duplication of possession without an accompanying duplication of ownership. The result is nevertheless that someone comes into possession of property without the right to own it. Distilled, this is an entirely fair conceptualization of theft.",1375581035

You are correct that it doesn&#x27;t negotiate lower prices like the DoD does (through an RFP and bid system), however it does:<p>1.  force drug makers to match the lowest price that it offers to anyone else.  In other words Medicare gets the same (or lower) price as big insurers like United.<p>2.  force drug manufacturers to discount the cost of drugs for Medicare Part-D once the patient enters the donut hole.  Over the next 5 years that discount will increase to 50% of the cost incurred within the donut hole (this will total several billions per year)<p>3.  for Medicaid, force the drug manufacturers to provide a 23.1% discount off the WAC (wholesale price) OR the lowest price offered to anyone else (whichever is lower)<p>4.  for disproportionate share hospitals (hospitals that serve the uninsured), force drug companies to provide the Medicaid discount (at least 23.1%) to those hospitals for <i>all</i> the drugs they buy, whether or not they go to the uninsured<p>5.  if the drug company increases the cost of its drug at a rate greater than the rate of inflation (CPI), they have to pay CPI penalties each year.

6154163,comment,6152781,6153924,2,0,cromwellian,,,"It&#x27;s interesting you mention Web Audio, because Web Audio, AFAIK, is based on a tried and true mature Audio API (Core Audio on OSX, Chris Rogers worked on both) that has had tons of feedback from the professional audio community for years. I wonder, how much of the objection is based on Mozilla because their counter proposal to essentially delegate DSP to JS was rejected?<p>And how do you define working in the open? Isn&#x27;t dropping design docs and sample implementations into open repositories, and then iterating on them in public, open? Asm.js was just dropped like a bomb on everyone. When they announced it, they had running code already, and V8 at the time ran it very poorly. When Mozilla announced their Device API effort, they completely avoided the parallel W3C effort at first (I don&#x27;t blame them) There&#x27;s a kind of bizarre mismatch in the treatment between Google&#x27;s work on projects in the open, and Mozilla&#x27;s code dumps which get a pass.<p>The specs-first-implementation-second approach is IMHO a ret-con of how things are done in the industry. Rough consensus and running code is the usual model. You need experience from implementations in the wild to inform the specification, feedback from actual people trying to develop applications or implementations. Pretty much everything that went into each revision of OpenGL started life as a &quot;behind closed doors&quot; OpenGL extension, that was subsequently generalized, and incorporated into the base spec.<p>We tried the &quot;do everything at the standards committee level first&quot; in the 00s at the W3C and the Web stagnated. XHTML, XForms, XSL, XPath, XPointer, SVG, SMIL, on and on. A long list of mostly failed standards that took forever to get standardized, and by the time they did, the world had moved on. Really, only SVG remains viable and the spec is crazy complex.<p>Look at how C# evolved vs Java. Java worked via a community process &quot;don&#x27;t break existing semantics&quot;, and as a result, we got really shitty generics, and hardly any improvements to the bytecode or VM. Microsoft took a shotgun to C# 1.0, and as a result, IMHO, C# 3.0+ is way better than Java.<p>Frankly, I don&#x27;t believe Javascript&#x27;s semantic model can be evolved without breaking backwards compatibility. For example, Javascript is fundamentally single threaded and non-shared memory, yet today&#x27;s devices, even mobile ones, have 2-8 cores on them. You can introduce shared memory, but then what, how do you implement concurrency primitives? You&#x27;re retrofitting a memory model into a language that didn&#x27;t have one, unlike Java which introduced the JMM early on. To me, Javascript&#x27;s memory and execution model makes it fundamentally incompatible for something like an intermediate representation for portable code for high performance games. Yes, the demos are impressive, but who is going to ship Infinity Blade 3 as asm.js on mobile if there&#x27;s a native OpenGLES API? The TC39 committee is essentially operating with design constraints that inhibit solving real problems with the language due to concerns with backwards compatibility. It&#x27;s mostly syntactic sugar.<p>Everything has to start somewhere. Java started out from zero, backed only by Sun. C# as well. A whole community of libraries and tools had to be built. All languages go through this process.<p>I work on GWT, it outputs JS, so I understand the power of leveraging existing libraries and toolchains. But there are always pioneers and early adopters who want to work on fresh new platforms and throw away existing paradigms. Why oppose them?<p>I think it is important for people to sometimes ignore what exists and see what can be done if you start from scratch.

At this point it starts to look like a networking and evidence problem. If we have ban groups - that you can join or unjoin as you please, to make abuse less likely, and have each individual user&#x27;s decisions absolutely override any group level decision for their account.<p>Okay, what are the potential problems with that?<p>How would you vote?<p>If someone&#x27;s banned from one person&#x27;s account gets banned from all of them, then as the group increases the power of any individual within that group will increase.<p>Require more than one person to make a decision to get rid of someone?<p>How do we stop groups of thugs just voting to shut someone up?<p>Choose a representative sample? Say by forwarding the reported post to three people within the group and having them all sign off on it.<p>Downside is you duplicate work - upside is you reduce the potential for them all to be evil - and if the group itself is evil then it&#x27;s not a group that people would want to be part of anyway.<p>How do you keep trolls out?

Did you bother to look at the actual code?<p>>There were no replies from Chromium&#x27;s side.<p>You seem to be conflating the members of the Dart project with the members of the Chromium project.

I mean, the Dart leads were explicitly CC&#x27;d on the Oilpan announcement, and I&#x27;m sure the teams do communicate at least occasionally. So, I would hope that Dart engineers would be aware of the potential impacts. And he even expressed it as a hope, with the rest of the context making it pretty clear that he was prepared to <i>re-introduce</i> scopes if Oilpan didn&#x27;t work out or arrive in time.<p>Thinking about it, your citation does an even better job than mine of demonstrating that Dart isn&#x27;t in any way dependent on Oilpan.",1375578254

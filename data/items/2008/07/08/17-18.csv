240100,comment,239460,239990,0,0,tptacek,,,"Come on. Userland code constantly blows L1 cache. Almost any library call will churn the icache. For that matter, any memory access can collide the TLB. None of those things are syscall-specific. If you were concerned about L1 and icache, you needed to write your code meticulously to accomodate them anyways.<p>Yes, cache is important. But there's a world of difference between the ""flush the caches and the TLB"" behavior that system calls used to incur and the ""expensive relative to local variable access"" behavior we're talking about here.<p>""A bounce to non-local, non-current execution environment"" literally doesn't mean anything. You could be talking about the CR3 change that swaps page hierarchies, the CPL3->0 change that allows privileged instructions, the CS change that got you there, or even the ESP change to ""swap stacks"". \nWhich of these are expensive?<p>I'm chasing you down because it's fun, not because I think you don't know what you're talking about.<p>But, let's make this relevant: if system call overhead is drowned by disk I/O overhead, then one argument for mmap goes away.",1215539495

Processes that communicate using files, pipes, sockets, or even shared memory.""\nYou are spot on with the problem itself being hard. As I understand it, the distinction between a process and a thread is that threads share memory. If you don't want to use the shared address space, simply don't use it - thread local variables are fine. The issue is that there are multiple threads of execution happening concurrently, and therefore communicating data is difficult. It's hard to believe that taking away the shared memory will do anything but make things harder. Like ajross says, parallel algorithms are just hard.",1215539322

Whether a lack of features and a strict conformance to bare software is a net positive or negative for small business is another conversation, but this does point out a need for features that they are missing.<p>This also comes along with 37signals' post on the permanent nature of features, and the importance of getting it mostly right from the beginning.<p>On that topic, the idea of providing business services in the mindset UNIX tools is beginning to be really attractive to me. Provide a limited set of features in a small bundle that plays well with other services, along a similar mindset. A billing component, a collaboration component, etc, such that each one can play with another very well.

""staying alive"" is easier in 'southwest airlines' cities.<p>Take a look at the map of where Southwest Airlines flies to and you get a feel for 'alternative' cities that should have enough infrastructure for a startup.<p>In my neck of the woods, albany,ny we were the excitement of the entire area.  We were on the front pages of the local paper all the time.  Recruiting was easier because people knew who we were and understood we paid less, but had the excitement they were seeking.<p>We got free legal advice because lawyers wanted to be associated with us.  We won local business plan competitions ($100k cash).  We got investment from local VC's wanting to build up the area.<p>We paid $1500 a month in rent, including all utilities, for a mansion on the hudson river (and lived in the 5 bedrooms on the second floor).  Our internet (cable modem) was $40 a month and screaming fast because our neighbors probably didn't even have it.<p>That helped us 'stay alive' long enough to figure out how to make money.",1215536487

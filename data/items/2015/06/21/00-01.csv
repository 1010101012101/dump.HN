Team productivity is up, fixing/changing older UI is easier/quicker, it&#x27;s great. We&#x27;ve tried angular, we were using just vanilla JS and Jquery, React is great. A great resource you should check out is the slack channel Reactiflux. Many active people and they will answer any question you have!<p>At this point we have around 60 pages, hundreds of components. It scales very well. Give React a few days when trying it out. We also use our own customer flux implementaion, which makes handling front end data models easier through one directional data flow. I recommend checking that out also, it scales very well. Some of our pages right now would push angular to the limit with hundreds of rows, many different components, etc, React handles it really well without having to meticulously tweak performance, it just works. Angular can do the job as well, just needed a lot of quirks to make it work.",1434848378

9751652,comment,9751312,9751561,0,0,awalton,,,"register-register movs are needed because compilers are not the world&#x27;s smartest code generators, and we don&#x27;t have an infinite number of registers. The biggest problem arises when some calling convention expects certain things to be in certain registers - unless you do some pretty extreme long term planning in your register allocation code in the compiler, you&#x27;re pretty likely to eventually wind up with some piece of information in a register that you need to move to another register before making or returning from a call.<p>Of course, modern processors don&#x27;t really care about register-register moves because they have hundreds of hidden intermediate registers and register renaming which makes those types of moves &quot;free.&quot; (e.g. Haswell has 168 GP registers, only 16 of which are exposed through the AMD64 ISA.)",1434848356

Startup founders are not created equal. In today&#x27;s hot market, there are a lot of inexperienced and incompetent people running startups. These people can work as hard as they want and ooze passion from every pore in their bodies but at the end of the day, they&#x27;re incapable of building successful businesses.<p>2. Statistically, most startups won&#x27;t achieve an exit. At those that do, most employees don&#x27;t &quot;make lots of money.&quot;<p>3.

9751634,comment,9751377,9751377,0,0,wpietri,,,"My personal experience (started 5 companies, 20+ years in tech, 15 of those in SF) is that you are right to worry, but only modestly so unless things get worse.<p>The best people I&#x27;ve worked with take care of themselves. The worst let the pressure of the situation get to them and burn themselves out. I saw one company totally destroyed by a CEO who sent out a poorly considered &quot;let&#x27;s reorg the company&quot; email at 2 am after the company Christmas party. Many times I&#x27;ve seen whole teams working stupid hours and ending up making stupid mistakes, or doing the startup equivalent of &quot;controlled flight into terrain&quot;[1]. The worst gig I ever had was at a company where people celebrated &quot;heroic&quot; efforts, because it created a strong incentive to let problems pile up until they could only be resolved through heroic efforts. Macho bullshit is certainly fun and entertaining for a while, but it&#x27;s a terrible foundation for a serious company.<p>I know a lot of people who are second- or third-time founders, and a common conversational theme is that the biggest thing they&#x27;re doing differently is aiming for a sustainable pace. The common line is &quot;it&#x27;s not a sprint, it&#x27;s a marathon&quot;, but I think even that comparison falls short. A lot of people run exactly one marathon because they train too hard and burn out. Median time-to-exit is something like 6 years, so we aren&#x27;t talking one race, we&#x27;re talking about marathon after marathon after marathon. It&#x27;s not a sprint, it&#x27;s a running career.<p>Hopefully this guy can pull it together, so in your shoes I&#x27;d call this a yellow flag. But I would work hard to make sure the behavior doesn&#x27;t spread to the engineering team. Tired programmers make dumb mistakes and then preserve them forever in source control. They will lurk there and spring upon you at the worst possible times, eating up far more time than was ever apparently created by working late.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled_flight_into_terrain"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled_flight_into_terrain</a>",1434847956

One difference, at least from what I&#x27;ve seen, is that the incivility mentioned in the article is generally directed at the clients (behind closed doors of course).  Especially once you grow past a size where losing a single client won&#x27;t kill the company, you get the blame the client for everything that goes wrong (really just venting about the normal things that go wrong in any technology delivery).<p>I do think that, in that environment, one of the senior people has the responsibility to keep the client hate from becoming totally toxic and pervasive.  Of course there are bad clients but even good clients can be demanding and you don&#x27;t want to have a whole team of client facing people who hate all of their clients.",1434847916

Came here to see the comments, apparently was not a troll. Wow.<p>So the question I have here is, was he aware of how outrageously douchey this article comes off with the examples being off the cuff entirely over-the-top money blowing that he apparently regularly indulges in, or are rich people so in their own world that they don&#x27;t even realize how normal people live and that writing something like this comes off as absurd to most people?<p>And another question that comes to mind too. He tried to make a startup that solved a similar problem a while ago, and mentioned this in the article. Are rich people seeking further conveniences for their already rather convenient lives entirely blind to the range of problems middle or lower class people deal with? Do they not care about these types of people and their problems because it simply not relevant to them?<p>I know this sounds very accusing of rich people, and while I am always personally a little shocked to see money squandered carelessly while so much suffering happens in the world, I honestly do not have anything against these people at all.

It is of course, unreasonable to expect ML algorithms to perform decently, so far outside of the space they were trained on.<p>But I suspect that part of the reason they don’t do well is that they are purely feed forward. Humans also don’t see the image at first. It takes time to find the pattern, and then everything clicks into place and you can’t unsee it.<p>This might have something to do with recurrency. But more importantly, information feeds down the hierarchy as well as up. Features above, give information back down to features below. So once you see the dog, that tells the lower level features that they are seeing legs and heads, which says they are seeing outlines of more basic 3 dimensional shapes, and so on.<p>I think it also requires a descent understanding of 3d space, to fit the observed pattern to 3d models which could have produced it. I’m not certain if regular NNs observing static images, are optimal for learning that.<p>More here: <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/399ooe/testing_image_recognition_platforms_on_a_famous/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/399ooe/tes...</a>",1434846627

Healthy is a different story and being productive is another question. What you don&#x27;t know on the flip side is his exact sleep habits which you could be missing altogether. There are some people that nap and work in spurts of time. I have horrible sleep habits sometimes and if I am stressed I can have insomnia at times. But as an example, I used to get up at 3am work until 5 or 6am, take an hour nap, go to the gym for an hour, and then off to work. I would stop working around 5pm come home eat, relax, do housework, whatever else and take a nap until about 10pm. Then get up work till midnight and back to sleep. I found I was much more relaxed and had a ton more energy sleeping in small cycles like that. I also found myself sleeping in cycles on weekends even more. I would work 3-4 hours, nap an hour or two, work 3-4 hours, nap again, and over and over. What works sleep wise for one person may not work for the next, so it is hard to answer your question precisely.<p>As a side story, the first startup I worked for back in the late 90s during the first bubble the CEO was older and well respected among Internet companies. He had just come off the CEO position at one of the biggest data center companies of the time and was well connected. One day not long after I started I had an idea for the company and randomly emailed him at like 10pm. He responded around 3 or 4am. I was working night shift in the data center and emailed him right back (part with a sense of surprise that he answered me and part with a sense of surprise that it was that early in the morning). Long story short, it ended up becoming an open line of communication between us that if I had a question or needed something I would just email him at 3am and usually have an answer within minutes.<p>As for the other part regarding the bragging, I would just take that in strides. That&#x27;s just part immaturity and part probably trying to make co-workers feel guilty for only working 10 hours instead of 11 each day. I think it also comes from the accelerator mentality of grind, grind, grind to have a demo product in a short period of time.<p>Regardless I wouldn&#x27;t worry about it too much unless you start seeing problems such as him demanding employees do the same (i.e. expecting you to respond to emails at 3am) or having short temper with employees. I wouldn&#x27;t worry about the little errors either. It is a startup there are going to be missteps along the way.

(hint: there is only 7 technology levels, 8 is the human one).<p>One story in particular my firm was hired to come into a startup that had failed to scale, both technology wise, and personnel wise.  They had hired up to 25 engineers, hoping to fix their stability issues, and almost going bankrupt doing it.  I am at no liberty to say which company this is publicly unfortunately.<p>It was stressful, but you can&#x27;t take things personal.  You have to put aside feelings, to get useful data out of these people to make the platform work.  You can&#x27;t possibly care about someone&#x27;s ethics, approach, and often even coding style on these missions.  The goal is to try and not piss off as many people as you and, and go ahead not worry if you do have to piss someone off to get the job done, and not lose sleep at night if someone does not get along with you.<p>The end result was that they had to shed, through various reasons the great majority of their internal team.  We stabilized things and bought them lots of time, while they slowly brought in new senior tech management and rebuilt their internal team from the ground up.<p>It was a multi year affair, and involved working on over 12 codebases and consolidating applications from 3 different hosting providers into AWS.<p>They got very close to running the ship into the ground.  If you think staying up late and pulling the occasional all-nighter is unhealthy, or having a job that has extremely high expectations and leave you no time for a personal life is bad, this is about one hundred times worse.  Since my team is small and highly skilled we can get a lot done in a short amount of time, and occasionally we are terse even with each other.  But the amount of sleep deprivation that comes with a task of gargantuan size, where your dealing with hundreds and thousands of requests (sometimes per second), the company is going for broke, and a single code change can improve monetary situations in instantaneous, tractable ways, it gets super intense.<p>You have the CEO, the COO, the CFO all breathing down your neck.  One day they see light at the end of the tunnel from fixing the currently broken problem, and then the next day, you discover another codebase lost in git that powers commerce for android, is starting to experience issue, and you don&#x27;t even know where to find credentials to log into its production systems since it was setup by some employee in the middle of the night a year ago that is no longer there.<p>I can go on and on and on.  But honestly, please don&#x27;t read this as a recommendation.  Being a digital mercenary is fun in your 20s, but it got old quick.  Of course I still do it, but I have a much healthier way of saying NO, more often now.  You can make a very lucrative living doing this sort of work, but its hard to earn the reputation to get these clients, and you may end up forgetting what your family looks like by the end of a 2 year job that is 365/24/7.<p>The story did have a happy ending though.  The company does well today. Extremely well.  A new era of management has come in over the last year, and I think everyone learned a lot.  They are a household brand and I hear about them in the news it seems like monthly.<p>Cheers",1434845157

They might be rich, but they would be condemned and considered pariahs among their peers.  You could optimize your personal gain, but the reputational damage would be be so suboptimal for your firm that you&#x27;d wind up in a net worse position.<p>Social norms and conventions have significantly shifted since then.  It is now entirely acceptable for executives to pay themselves several hundred times the average worker compensation[1].  <i>There is no longer any real cost, reputational or otherwise, for optimizing for your personal gain</i>  So you might as well get yours, and fuck everyone else.  Sure, some people with &quot;Sanders 2016&quot; bumper stickers will whine on Reddit about you, and maybe they&#x27;ll even get together and yell at some buildings until they collapse due to a combination of in-fighting and tear-gas.  But for the most part, you&#x27;ll just shrug, order another round of layoffs, and think about how much your RSUs will appreciate in the inevitable stock price bump.<p>And if you&#x27;re truly concerned about reputational risk, and can&#x27;t reconcile that some people in society will still think you&#x27;re a &quot;bad person&quot; for this, and the thought of being a bad person causes too much discomfort for your liking, then you can literally <i>compare them to Hitler and find a sympathetic audience.</i>[2]<p>I have to imagine -- and yes, I literally have to imagine, because I don&#x27;t have any quantitative evidence and don&#x27;t pretend otherwise -- that this is essentially a sociopath mindset (perhaps best explained by the Gervais Principle[3]) that then trickles down at every level of most professional organizations.  When you&#x27;re optimizing for your personal gain, you don&#x27;t have a lot of time to consider things like &quot;empathy&quot; or &quot;fairness.&quot;  This is unfortunate to those disposed to such personality traits like the OPs father, because they essentially get eaten alive in the modern American workplace.  At many professional organizations, the approach is binary.  If it&#x27;s not &quot;fuck you, got mine&quot; then it&#x27;s &quot;fuck!  you got mine.&quot;<p>HN is known for having a significant population of those who that there is nothing wrong with this, and if the most productive members of society happen to be sociopaths, then they should be rewarded as such as their productivity is what drives the human race forward.  But what&#x27;s unfortunate to me is that this means some of our society&#x27;s most brilliant and productive people will essentially get marginalized in their professional (and indirectly, their personal) lives, not because they lack some level of competence, self-reliance, productivity, etc, but because they&#x27;re incapable of embracing a sociopathic mindset to professional advancement.<p>I have no problem with those who want to make their fortunes in any way possible, so they can retire to Galt&#x27;s Gultch with their fortunes.

What you say is totally valid if your company is a fortune 500 company, but the type of people who <i>start</i> companies shouldn&#x27;t strive to become those types of managers covered in business case studies. I made this mistake after reading too many business books.<p>It simply doesn&#x27;t work. From my experience it fucks up the company culture when a founder tries to &quot;tone it down&quot;, because that&#x27;s not the quality required to make stuff happen when it&#x27;s in the beginning stage.<p>A competent founder should be able to adapt as the company grows, but shouldn&#x27;t behave like a fortune 500 CEO from the beginning.",1434844858

If someone actively goes around pissing off as many people as possible, how is it not in someways &quot;their own fault&quot; when someone reacts poorly to this?<p>Also, as another poster said, calling the pissed-off employer a &quot;sabotager&quot; is not actually what the article is saying. The manager may &quot;sabotage&quot; their own success by causing all of the employees under themselves to quit en masse. Is this a &quot;bad&quot; action that <i>only</i> the employees are responsible for, leaving the manager as the poor and helpless victim?",1434844832

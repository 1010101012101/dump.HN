There's simply too many simple tasks that are made much easier with ad-hoc scripting.

Since I don't really believe in the gender binary, it's quite strange to even talk about ""correct"" or ""incorrect"" genitals, except perhaps as shorthand for ""physical sex characteristics that are in greater/lesser conformance to socially constructed gender norms for that sex"". I can certainly see why someone who felt they better matched the A gender role but was born with B sex characteristics would want to switch, but I see that as more of a problem with rigid gender roles than with anything else.<p>It even a little uncomfortably feels like it perpetuates traditional gender/sex views, that there's something <i>incorrect</i> about someone with particular physical characteristics not fitting a particular gender role--- and that they need to correct it by changing their physical characteristics to match. That's certainly a choice people can legitimately make, but phrasing it as correct/incorrect comes uncomforatbly close to stigmatizing people who don't match traditional gender/sex conformance and yet <i>don't</i> feel that there's anything about that that needs ""correcting"".<p>(I agree in either case on calling people by whatever gender pronoun they prefer, though.)",1286160644

That's what I think are averages, for GOOD/above average engineers in established companies (not startups). Keep in mind that a good or average engineer in some companies, could be easy a superstar in other companies. They are always outliers for expectational people, but it seems that the places that pay consistently less:<p>1. Don't care for top talent (they may not really need it).<p>2. Are not usually worth working for (eg. gaming industry / old finance/ companies that view tech as a cost)<p>3. Offer some kind of life quality balance and don't expect high outputs from their employees.<p>If you are not happy with your current salary you can still interview around and find another job.  Don't necessary quit, but at least you would know whats out there.\nIf your think your job is easy/cushy, then 110k is not that bad, but actually good.  You can easily go somewhere else, and get a 20k bumb, but find out you have to work twice as hard.\nIf you are really challenged, and are stressed, and feel underpaid, then you must do something:<p>1. Ask for a raise.\n2. Find another job that pays better.<p>What I found out, is that no matter how fun the job is, if you feel 'underpaid', over time that will create some feelings of resentment and unhappiness.  Also, if you get paid well, but hate the job, then you would still feel unhappy.<p>The happy medium, is finding something that you really like, and are happy with the salary at the same time  (usually when you think you are on the higher range salary compared to your peers).",1286160284

1754383,comment,1754015,1754359,0,0,_delirium,,,"Yeah, I do think there are not many Hamiltonian libertarians. But there seems to be a subset that, at least as a matter of tactics, and perhaps even long-term strategy, sees federal constitutional rights being enforced against the states as a major way of advancing libertarian ideas, which cuts somewhat against a more conservative ""states' rights"" sort of view. And some are willing to do so even when as a matter of textualism or originalism it's a bit of a stretch. Hence folks like Randy Barnett and David Bernstein advocate a revival of <i>Lochner</i> to preempt state employment regulations, despite the fact that many other libertarians think that ""substantive due process"" is a huge federal power-grab.<p>I suppose some other areas are less controversial, e.g. even most pro-decentralization libertarians are perfectly happy for courts to rule that the Second Amendment preempts state and local firearms laws, or that the First Amendment throws out state blasphemy laws.",1286159911

The constitution is explicitly written such that every individual, ""random"" or not, is expected to enforce it.

The methods for amending the constitution are laid out in the document itself.<p>Since the document does not give the federal government any power to regulate employment, these laws are unconstitutional.  It doesn't matter what the supreme court says, as the supreme court is a group of political appointees beholden to the political establishment.<p>IF the constitution is not a functioning legal document, then then it has no power.  If it is a functioning legal document, then all these unconstitutional laws are actually null and void (as ruled in Maybury v.

A solid foundation in systems administration is essential for this role, but the SRE group  \nare not primarily sysadmins - they are application admins, which is quite a different thing.  Any given Google application may have hundreds or even thousands of actual servers associated with it, so the kind of ""system administration"" with which most people here are familiar is not necessarily pertinent.

1754359,comment,1754015,1754324,0,0,lzw,,,"I believe it is not so much that some libertarians are pro-federalist while others are less federalist. It is that most libertarians recognize that if the federal government was operating within the bounds of the constitution (that is, legally) then states would have much more power relatively, and that this is a good thing.  All libertarians also, though, recognize that individual rights do exist, as this is the basis of libertarianism.<p>The constitution doesn't create any rights, it only contains prohibitions on the trampling of various rights. The Preamble of the Bill of Rights makes this clear. According to the constitution, individual rights pre-exist the creation of the constitution, and the BoR is merely there to make doubly sure that the government knows it is not given license to violate them.<p>Libertarians (generally) hold the view that the states do not have such a license either, as being <i>rights</i>, there is no situation (other than consensual explicit agreement) whereby they can be legitimately violated.<p>So, Libertarians may disagree on whether the constitution is a good document or not, but generally agree that it would be a better government than we have now.<p>To quote Lysander Spooner: Either the constitution has authorized the government we have now, or it has failed to prevent it.<p>Like Lysander, I believe libertarians see the constitution as a failed document.  I don't think there are Federalist libertarians-- in fact, calling someone a ""hamiltonian"" is an insult in some libertarian circles.<p>(None of this is to say that you're wrong, but that you presented me an opportunity to expound on this since many people seem to be confused by libertarian positions.

Sometimes you will be surprised to learn that what might be classically called ""A.I"" has utterly invaded your favorite field and that the people who work in it are entirely unaware that the learning systems they're using might even be considered ""A.I"".",1286158201

""Being an asshole"" is a transient state of doing something asshole-like. Even the best people do this at times. I chose the term ""being an asshole"" carefully.<p>> <i>Thank you for calling me an asshole for not agreeing with you.</i><p>I don't think disagreeing with me makes someone an asshole. I think that some <i>actions</i>, which may or may not stem from differing beliefs, are asshole-like. If you believe that he's still a woman, fine. But if you refuse to respect him enough to call him ""he"" even though that's what he considers himself and wants to be called (whether or not you agree that he's male), you're being an asshole.<p>Especially because being transgendered is extremely hard. In most parts of the US, it's now socially acceptable to be gay. Some people will still have hangups, you'll still face some hostility, etc. but it's not where near as bad as it used to be. Transgendered people are still basically where gay people were 40 years ago. Calling them by one pronoun when they prefer the other just adds to their feeling that society doesn't accept them.<p>So you're not only disrespecting their preferences, you're disrespecting a preference that's related to an issue where they've faced a lot of strife.<p>> <i>Thank you for calling me an asshole for thinking that drugs and cosmetic surgery do not make the person, the person just is.</i><p>Drugs and cosmetic surgery don't make the person. But neither does the body. If someone who physically is a woman in every way and hasn't even started taking testosterone yet tells you that he is transgendered and considers himself a man, use male pronouns to refer to him as well.",1286157907
